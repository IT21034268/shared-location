1,A cartoonish oversimplification of a complex subject,"What do you look for in a business book? If you answered weird-looking fonts, cartoonish graphics, and breezy text, then Bob Adams' ""Streetwise Small Business Start-Up"" may be for you.Bob went to Harvard, but don't worry, this book won't be over your head. Mr. Adams' tips are long on folksy charm and short on hard facts. Often, he simply points out the obvious. Example (p.99): ""Consumers tend to pay a lot more attention to feature coverage in newspapers, television, and radio than they do to advertising."" You don't say, Bob?Mr. Adams tries to jazz up his limp writing by using strange fonts and dingbats, plenty of (uninformative) graphics, and even tilting whole pages diagonally, but these gimmicks merely underscore the book's emptiness. The graphics throughout are as vapid are as the text, and look like they were snatched from a bargain-basement clip-art collection.Would-be entrepreneurs, do yourself a favor and buy a different book."
4,This could be the only business guide you'll ever need.,"Whether you are planning to start a business or already own one, the Adams Streetwise Small Business Start-Up could be the only business guide you'll ever need. Organized into eight major sections covering strategy, marketing, sales, advertising, people, money, legal, and office, this book takes you from the very basics of starting a business through how to get the best and most effective marketing for your particular situation. It helps you deal with people problems that can waste your time and money. And it always keeps your eyes focused on your sales, costs and profits.(c)1999, VentureConsult.com"
4,Excellent foundation book-hits a lick on all aspects.,"Great reference book for starting a business. Covers all aspects from accounting & tax issues to marketing, and much more. I heartily recommend this book in all my seminars. Very useful three way presentation style: in depth; Q & A; and stories with graphics. One of them is bound to match your learning style."
4,buy it for kids/parents will enjoy also,"For the coordinated Kid and adult tests your ability to ""stick"" with it"
4,"frogger the a,mazing amphibian","ok, the game and frogger have changed alot. new enemies new story new worlds, but never a new frogger. ok, look there is one world thats not on the map. im on the boss. its hard. its a maaching game, but you have to get three of the same cards, if you get one wrong youll' be attacked, by the power of the shards. oh and if you think you know which card the boss is hiding, dont toutch that card. watch out for him. the game is hard. i suggest you get it if your a frogger fan."
4,Sonny Baca and Raven square off for Round 2!,"Rio Grande Fall is the second novel featuring the resourceful Alburquerque private eye, Sonny Baca. Rita, Lorenza, Turco, Don Elesio, Howard, and the rest of the unforgetable characters from Zia Summer are featured and so is the diabolical eco-terrorist, Raven!The Hot Air Balloon Festival of Alburquerque is in danger of being cancelled unless Sonny Baca can figure out who is responsible for the murder of two balloon pilots. It doesn't take Sonny long to realize that his arch rival, Raven is responsible, but Raven has more on his agenda than just vengance. A beautifully written novel with suspense and surprises all set in the mysteriously charming state of New Mexico.Not as good as Zia Summer, but an enjoyable sequel nontheless!"
2,Mumbo Jumbo,"I have read the first two books in this series, and I am not up to read the rest. Sonny Baca, the supposed detective hero, is so incompetent, and the confrontations he has with his adversaries so contrived, that it is juvenile. Baca is so constantly stumbling into traps, that the reader is saying ""Sonny, don't go in there"" two pages before he runs head long into another trap. After a while it become silly. The way Sonny escapes from the traps is even sillier. And the exotic spiritualism is never explained in a way that makes any sense. After a while it is so much Mumbo Jumbo. The shame of the matter is that Anaya is a prose master, and the images he conveys are effective. The problem is the stories are simply lacking any believability.If you want southwestern mysticism and great story telling, by a truely talented writer, try The Shaman Sings, and the other books by James Doss."
3,Follow up to Zia Summer not as hot,"I found Rio Grande Fall to be a very entertaining book. However, it greatly relies on the reader being familiar with the first book Zia Summer. While Anaya tries to fill in some of Zia's happenings, it would have been a very difficult book to read without first reading Zia Summer. Sonny Baca is a great character, but lacks some depth that he had in Zia. You would think that Sonny would have learned his lesson concerning the villian Raven. Anaya's style is supurb but lacks some Christian aspects that could easily be incorporated into his spiritualism. Unlike some reviewers, I did not find it to be a ""preachy"" novel, but gave another religious interpretation. I also loved Anaya's description of the Southwest and the culture. He certainly could rival Tony Hillerman. Overall I would recomend reading Rio Grande Fall, but after the superior Zia Summer."
2,Crappy Crap Crap,"This is a perfect example of why ""Chicano"" literature took so long to catch on. America had to wait until its population was saturated with the Mexican filth. This use of hispanic language is this book was distracting and gratuitous; however, the most disturbing part of the novel was the incessant mention of some act of incest between Sonny, the stories protagonist, and his first cousing. Please excuse me while I vomit. I want to defecate on this book before I turn it back in to the library."
2,Good game gone bad on the Xbox,"Here is a case of a great game gone bad to the console. At least you can choose from 5 different boards or themes. However, the game quickly becomes redundant watching your piece move the alloted squares. Even though you can speed through the walking it still is quite boring. Trading and building are almost impossible as you can't read the streets on the screen that allows you to do that. Overall, spend your money on something else."
5,Xbox Monopoly Party,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoy this game. We rented it on a whim and couldn't stop playing. Needless to say, we ended up buying it in order to stop having to pay the rental fees. It's nice because we finally found a game we can play together and separately. The only DISADVANTAGE was that the standard US rules are not totally true. (ie. When you role doubles to get out of jail the monopoly rules say that you cannot role again; however, the xbox game allows you to. Also, you are not suppose to be able to go directly to a hotel without houses for a least one full turn; however the xbox game allows you to.) This being said there are also many ADVANTAGES in the game such as the range of rules you can have. It's nice to be able to set up the game as you would play it normally in your home and completely by your rules, however you may play.This is a MUST HAVE!"
3,if only the 360 could play it,i had only a 360 when i bought this and was crushed when i couldnt play it. i love monopoly though and bought it for the psp.
1,Does not work for xbox 360,I bout this because of the xbox name. However I did not realize it would not work in an xbox 360. Please be careful when ordering to make sure it is for the exact system you have.Monopoly Party
3,Some Decent Tips,Mitchell helps readers attack clutter by offering a system for handling the piles of paper. I would like to have seen several other tips for increasing productivity beyond paper management.
5,The Creation!,"The Creation is the next in Line, these Groups were basicly boom boom boom, bang bang bang on the radio, Boy that radio was Steaming! Well any way, My favorite Songs are Making Time, Tom Tom, Sylvette, Biff Bang Pow, I Am the Walker, Midway Down and The Ostrich Man! I like The Downliners Sect but mostly these Three Songs, ""Sect Appeal"", ""Cops and Robbers"" and ""I Want My Baby Back"", and that song is not for the RIBS Either! I Only like Two Songs by the Group ""Angel Pavement"" out of UK, and the songs are, ""When will I See June Again"" and ""The Man in the Shop on the Corner"" ( with a little Spanish Flavor Tempo, Hum, I wonder why with all that Furniture?) Awesome Stuff! People, just one song to mention, the group The She Trinity with there song ""Climb a Tree"" is awesome and why ahead of their time, but that's it with that group!"
3,Eddie Phillips played the bow before Jimmy Page,"The complete works of the band with a comprehensive timeline and listing of players on each tune as they went thru a couple line up changes. Making Time and Biff Bang Pow are as good as many early Who hits and have the same feel. I first became aware of them on the Nuggets II compilation. The 2 aforementioned songs and ""How Does it Feel to Feel"" are included on it and they really are the best 3 songs. A great addition for Small Faces and early Who fans"
1,It Stinks,"This game (....) it is really bad and is only for little kids and not older kids. This game has poor graphics, bad sound, and the worse control ever!!!"
2,don't get this game,Don't get this game I have the game and its boring! it only took me five min to complete the game and the new hamtaro game is much better than this game.
3,Hamtaro is cool,"I think that this is one of the best Hamtaro things people can get, so I would select this item."
1,Stupid Hamster,I dont get how a little fur ball running around with his friends could be fun. It has no point.I think that it would be a waste of money to buy.
4,A MUST have game!!!,"My friend got this game, and we both started playing it. We both liked the show, and I thought it would be easy. Boy, was I WRONG!!! It is EXTREMELY hard, and is worth getting, because it is a lot of fun. We beat it only when we had a game guide. This is a great gift for ANY Hamtaro, or gaming fan. The only down point is, that you can only have 1 game saved at a time. As they say, don't judge a book by it's cover. It may look cute, but it's a hard game to beat!"
3,good quality,"the films did not seem as good as when i first saw them years ago, but the quality of the dvds is great, and it's nice to see how good technicolor was"
3,Its ok,"I got the movie for Audie Murphy, but the others were a bonus. Pretty good b westerns. The product arrived in good condition."
3,4 Movie Marathon Classic Westerns,"This Films are not what I would describe or list amongst "" Classic Westerns "" but at the price provide you with 4 average to good westerns to enjoy, at the end of the day they are worth watching but only once."
4,good classic movies,Good picture quality and I love the movies being a western fan. I would buy this again and recommend it to anyone who likes westerns
4,Good collection of Classic Westerns with major stars...Good plots. A pleasure to watch,"This 4 story DVD was on 2 DVDs. I would of rather the collection of been on 4 DVDs individually jewel boxed. All the movies played well with good sound and color. No problems there. All are full frame 1.33:1All 4 movies are western classics and well worth seeing.Albuquerque stars Randolph Scot, 4 1/2 starsWhispering Smith stars Alan Ladd, 4 starsThe Duel of Silver Creek stars Audre Murphy ( Medal of Honer winner WW2)is my favorite of this 4 movie set....4 3/4 stars'War Arrow... Maureen O'hara and Jeff Chandler star. 4 stars.If you like Westerns you will like this DVD set. All these movies had lots of gun cowboy action and pretty women.Total rating 4 stars and proudly added to our family DVD library. I would of rated the collection a little higher if each movie was on an individual DVD in a individual jewel box."
5,A history to help us understand the Church today,"from Criss Cross, No. 5: ""a new resource that can help us to remember by becoming more familiar with the varied colorful history of the Catholic Church. . . can be recommended without hesitation for catechists, parents and all persons wishing to remember our Catholic roots. This history helps us to understand why the Catholic Church exists as it does today, while it gives necessary perspectives for envisioning the future."""
2,Not balanced,"Unfortunately, I ordered this book thinking that it was the book by the same title, but written by a true historian--Phillip Hughes. Carl Koch, on the other hand is a professor of education, human development, and English at Saint Mary's University of Minnesota Graduate School. If you are looking for a work on the Church by a true historian, look elsewhere. I recommend strongly the works of H. Daniel Rops, Phillip Hughes, and the especially readable Warren Carroll (History of Christendom series is superb).The work itself is the typical liberal-'catholic' dogma. Luther was a great guy that had it right and was wronged by the Church. ..those familiar with liberal garbage can probably guess the rest."
4,Another outstanding collection.,"While I've collected many Jazz CDs by artists and have several collections (e.g. ""Jazz for a Rainy Day"" and its brethren), this collection is large, very reasonably priced, and continues to introduce me to artists and tracks not already in my collection."
5,great chandelier,This was a super bargain purchase & very easy to put together. Chandelier is perfect for my space - a dining room with a cathedral ceiling. Looks as good as or better than anything I looked at in the local stores & cost less than half the price. The least expensive fixtures in this size were around $450 to $500 & this looks much better.
3,"Several good songs, but outstanding for ...","This is the ONLY place to find the fabulous 12"" version of Let's Get Serious on disc. All 7:58 are here in its' absolute glory. That's what makes this really worth it. The drums here are fantastic.Also of note (another great song) is In My House by the Mary Jane Girls. Whould've thought that Rick James' girls would make him this proud? Another great song.Most of the rest I would not constitute as filler, however half of it (the really good stuff) is easily found on other collections & half of it unfortunately is not up to par with the usual hits. This collection is completely worth it for the aforementioned reasons ... ifthis doesn't do it for you you may want to take a pass ..."
2,Ayres should have stopped with Against the Wind,"Ayers' first book, Against the Wind, is a thoughtful, well written travelogue that provides readers with fascinating insights into long-distance motorcycling--and one man's psyche. Against the Clock is none of that. This is a superfical hour-by-hour laundry list of what happened. During hour 456 deer number 38 crossed the road in front of me. On hour 675 I stopped for gas. This sort of prose is not just lacking in description, but totally uninteresting! Ron, it is the story behind the story that carries the narrative. This could have been a great book, but falls far short of that goal."
3,1st book much better,"Not of the same caliber ""Against the wind"" was (5 star !). I think the author goes out of his way to thank the long distance riding community but it just isn't that great of a read."
4,Excellent Read,"I have all of Ron's books. His first (Against the Wind) is the apex of the lot but ""Against the Clock"" is engaging and entertaining; worth the cost of entry. I followed Ron's exploits as he was doing the ride; reading reports from his ""home base"" (family) as well as those who met him at stops along the way (some of their photos are included in this book). While reading this book the shouts of, ""Go, Ron. GO!!!"", ring in my head as they did while the ride was taking place."
3,"Dated, but for most the cartoons will bring back memories","The man behind this collection of cartoons about rowdy students in elementary school is himself a junior high principal in Waterloo, Iowa. Therefore, he knows very well the trials and struggles of teachers as they try to work through their day in keeping their charges focused on their tasks at hand. If you can remember back to the days of elementary school, then many of the scenes will be familiar to you. The rush out for recess and the slooow walk back in when it was over leapt to my mind.One amusing thing my male adult mind spotted was the fact that in some of the cartoons the female teacher is drawn with only one breast. There is an upward curve at the top of the abdomen on one side but no corresponding curve on the other. That is most unusual; I have never seen that before in mainstream cartoons."
4,"zauberberg is excellent, eerie and hypnotic.","Zauberberg's (magic mountain) mysterious, hypnotic music invites you to listen to it over and over again. It is a trip into a obscure realm of twilight, creating images of menacing skies just before a summer rain."
1,Again a bad start,"to a series that has everything wrong with it.Guess expectation is the sister of disappointment. Bad performance, bad sound, bad direstion, bad everything."
5,Great TV Show,I really like this TV show. The story lines are good. The only thing is that they should have put the whole season on one dvd. I still bought all 3 dvds.
2,Love - Hate,"I got this back in November and simply loved them -- at least while they worked. The headset and adapter synced perfectly and although bulky I found the headset comfortable. However, as luck would have it the clip that is used to hold the ipod in place kept falling out. Soon after the front cover of the adapter fell off and would not stay on. Therefore, in early January I sent the unit back and they sent me a new adapter. A month and half later I now find myself once again having to request an RMA to send the unit back because now the adapeter won't even power on."
3,Amazon screws up,I just want to say that I own this CD. The Four Tops DO NOT APPEAR on it. Someone at Amazon made a major goof.
5,Heres how to get them..,"These are great! but amazon hasn't sold them in awhile now, so until they do I found another place to buy them, directly from the manufacturer! heres the link:[...]"
3,Well drawn; not very well written; partially faithful; lacked oomph.,"Overall, Resolute is essentially a triple-length G.I. Joe episode with death and blood. It was interesting but not as engaging as it should have been. I didn't feel as much as I should have toward either the heroes or the villains. The likely culprit is the dialogue; it wasn't horrible, but generally wasn't great. A couple of distractions came from unrealistic battle sequences involving people standing directly in the middle of heavy gunfire without being hit. Given the scale of the threat presented at the beginning of the film, I would have liked to have had some reference to other major characters that were not shown.The high point of this film is the animation, and the general visual style; it's all very smooth.Overall, I enjoyed it, but it lacked a greatness that I hoped for."
3,An Adult GI Joe written by Warren Ellis with Great Japan Animation!,"A great version of GI JOE, more hardcore and adult. Warren Ellis wrote the basic script and it shows! It is a great animation, a bit short (as it was first released as websodes) but highly entertaining.The animation is great, like a good anime and the plot is simple but effective. If you always wished to see GI JOE in a more adult and hardcore way, this is it! Bullets hurt, people get killed and all! :)"
5,"GI Joe for ""grown ups""","As a parent of small children I'll just re-iterate what others have said about the nature and theme of the movie.This movie is specifically designed for fans of the original 80's cartoon who enjoyed it as children and who played with all the toys and are now adults. It's GI Joe for ME, NOT my kids.The movie is fantastic and as an adult who never felt the need to ""outgrow"" cartoons I enjoyed it throughly.As others have said, if you were a Joe fan as a kid in the 80's then buy the movie, you'll love it. Again understand that while the movie will be great for you it may be a bit much for your kids if you have them."
4,GI Joe that's matured with the original 80's audience,"Bottom line, animated GI Joe for a mature audience. Deadly villains, life threatening (...and often taking) encounters and strong serious story-lines. This is what you would want from present day GI Joe as a fan of the original 80's series. This is a GI Joe thats ""grown up"", allowing it to appeal again today....to its original childhood fanbase of old. I urge those of you that once loved GI Joe, and wish to do so again, to purchase this release. Enjoy it, and support it with your dollar$ in hopes of sending a message to Hasbro that we want and WILL BUY more of the same."
4,best joe cartoon yet,"the closest we've come to a comic accurate cartoon and it was written by warren ellis who knew nothing about the brand before his coming to it. if you enjoy this even a little, check out the gi joe comics currently coming out from idw press. especially cobra by mike costa, its a (pardon the pun) grand-slam!"
3,Good in so many ways.. BAD in many others,"This movie had so much potential. So much promise.The storyline is well-concieved and implemented. And the animation is top-notch. I can't fault it for that.However, the needless, long gun-fights where both parties are standing in front of eachother (no dodging) at almost point-blank range sometimes and nobody hits anybody...ANDSEMI-SPOILERThe needless, abrupt, out-of-nowhere DEATH of severy key characters was ridiculous, and goes against the very nature of the classic GI-Joe series.This movie had so much potential, but fell short.Plus, it's not even a full-length feature."
2,disappointed,disappointed. like the original GI Joe animated movie better. maybe cause i'm old school. only liked the Snake and Storm Shadow stuff.
1,Way too old version,Sure it's the 8th version. But the number versions are recycled. This book is from 1992 and is not the one you're looking for.None of the questions and sections match up (:Cheers.
3,Great Book,"i bought my book from ever77, he was awesome i had my book in 3 daysand he sent me an e mail notifying me when i was going to receive my book he also sent me the tracking number of my package so that I could track my book online. I was very satisfied with amazon.com, they got me my book quickly and i paid less than half of what i was going to pay at a bookstore."
1,OOOOOhhhhh Wild Arms 3,Don't be fooled by the cover this game is just awful. The primitive battle system is grating. The storyline isn't even close to a western themed game. I know this is an RPG style western but it fails in that respect. It follows other RPG game formats to closely. It seems the creators of this game were too scared of losing RPG veterans interest in the game. A new concept for RPG would be most welcomed. I was hoping for a Wild West adventure but this is too much like other RPGs what a shame.This game had so much potential.Don't waste your money.
1,A major disappointment,I was hoping for a western adventure. This game let me down. I was hoping for a unique RPG but boy was I wrong. This game is boring. I'm glad I got it at a clearance price. I reget ever getting this game. I hope I can sell it very soon.Don't waste your money.
3,Got bored.,I got bored of this game maybe because it was outdated but maybe I just didn't spend enough time playing.
3,A mixture of gaming styles,"This is an excellent game for rpg fans who also have quick trigger fingers. However, if you are not good at platforming you will face some serious challenges. I was stymied part-way through the game by a door that would only open if 6 bombs were placed accurately within about 10 seconds. This will be a game ending challenge if you are not good at this sort of thing. The plot is interesting as are the characters. If you are interested in rpg's with more than a dash of platforming this is a great buy."
4,Pretty good overall.,"The game is alot of fun, it's alot like Wild Arms 1 and 2, yet it has a more complex combat system and better graphics. There are still a few of the more annoying things in the gameplay such as the sonar like symbol finder on the world map you have to use every few steps, but the game is still alot of fun."
5,Michael Buble-Spiderman Theme,I heard the spiderman theme by Michael Buble on XM's Cinemagic Channel 27 and I loved it so much I ordered it.This is sort of an easy listening version of the spiderman theme with Micheals great voice.I'm just suprised it wasn't on the spiderman 2 soundtrack.You hear Buble spiderman theme at the end of the movie.
5,The best crooner of our generation,"TokyoZapper you have it all wrong, buddy.I saw 3 Michael Buble gigs and met him several times during his Summer Italian Tour 2004, and all the times we've spent together he NEVER EVER denied a pic or an autograph to a fan, even when it was late at night and there were people waiting for him outside the hotel. He's everything but arrogant. As for the music, I don't know how much you are into swing, jazz and singing technique, but I can say that if you say that his voice is mediocre you have listened to the wrong stuff all your life. I have all of Michael Bublè cds available, and he CAN sing. Big time.If he's got so much money and power behind him, how come he became huge only a couple years ago (He's 29), when all these wonder-kids of music become huge at 17?? He's been singing professionally for over 10 years. Thank God David Foster heard him.He's great. He's got a great personality, he's a fantabulous entertainer, and all his cds are worth every cent."
4,Spidey Mahem,Spidey is Back ! in the bubble ! Go and get this CD his Spidey Voice will break u Down for sure !
1,Not What I Thought,"Because I'm a Buble fan, I thought it might have various songs from the movie ""Spiderman."" I was wrong...it was one long recording of the same song...."
3,blah!!!!,"I think this theme is very good, but the distillers did it better, HOW COME THEY DONT HAVE A SINGLE THEME?? their song is on the game......."
1,waste of money,"This CD is for you if you are a die hard Spider Man fan or a groupie of the same song of sway remixed 6 different ways. As for me, I got a headache."
5,great,"what's not to like about lego. my grandkids loved it and that's all that matters to me, nuff said okay"
5,Awesome!,"No pieces missing, lots of fun to build, and my son plays with it now like its a toy. Great purchase! I just wish the accompanying Lego City wasn't so expensive!"
4,Preparation for the parents,"This is another volume of the Handing on the Faith series - for preparation of parents seeking baptism for their child. As with other volumes in the series, the basic material is provided in small, appropriate chapters followed with questions for reflection and discussion; and quotations from the ritual itself, the Scripture and the Catechism of the Catholic Church. The meaning of baptism as the first step in the initation rituals, the doctrine of original sin, the practice of naming the child for a saint, and the selection/role of godparents are well explained in contemporary theology. The volumes of penance, communion and confirmation are superior to this volume because this volume tries too hard to provide solid theology at odds with traditional misunderstandings - without direct mention of the common beliefs. Nonetheless, this is a very satisfactory volume - a solid entry filling a real need for appropriate materials in sacramental preparation."
4,Blues Lover,"Stanley's first CD ""A Shot in the Dark"" is fantastic. Try it! And ""Feeling"" is blues at it's best. Close your eyes, feel the club atmosphere around you, start movin' to the music, and get your blues on baby!"
3,Rob's Review,"Book was set up well for the story line in the beginning, but actual combat to destroy the Ultimate Armored Vehicles...was dull. Would have liked more combat action fitting the ""War Dogs"" title."
5,War Dogs,"War Dogs is a #1 Hit. Along with Iron Tigers & Tin Solidiersyou are on the edge of your seat.Enough tanks, relationships and action. Don't forget thefamous Phantom.All 3 book are keepers for your libary"
1,Don't buy it.,There is no support on this product unless you want to pay for. it. I installed it on my pc and a few days later it would not print. There is nothing for you to click on and make changes. I do not remember setting up the username and password but now it wants one and will not let me reset or anything. When you are unable to call someone for help it makes the software next to worthless. Don't buy it. I have used Versa Check for years prior to this. There is no comparison.
3,Checksoft,"I have been using this software for several years now. I originally purchased it to be able to have my co. logo on the checks. This feature never worked. I only use it to print checks, nothing else. It works fine once you figure it out. The instructions are basically useless. Customer service is no help either. After a lot of frustrating attempts I was finally able to figure it out. I printed a blank check & took it to the bank for them to reveiew before actually using it. They accepted it. However my credit union would not accept it. Something technical in the routing. If you can get past the frustration level, then it is a pretty good product. In hindsight I think I should have used the check writing features of Quicken. The price at the time I purchased (at Fry's) was about $75., a bit steep. As I said though, I am still using the software and it has continued to function through 3 computer &/or hard drive changes. Thanks."
5,An interesting introduction to Stalin,Many of us have heard how terrible Stalin was but when you read him and of his arguments it really brings across the difficulties he had to face. Having said that there is much here which an advanced marxist-leninist could disagree with but all the same the best thing is to read his version of events directly.
1,My dog hates these glasses - and so do I !,"My dog has an eye disorder and has been wearing K 9 Optic sunglasses for probably 8-9 years now and tolerates them extremely well - no problems at all. NOW, they are NO LONGER AVAILABLE in X large (my dog weighs 95 pounds and has a broad bridge/nose). I tried the other glasses, the ones that have five holes on the sides and are completely closed in all around and he HATES them. These glasses do not allow for any air to circulate and his eyes get hot and sweaty and he constantly fights wearing them. How would YOU like to wear sunglasses that fit snuggly right up against your face with no possibility of air circulating?"
4,THE DOG HATES THEM,"This is a great item, and such a wonderful idea. The problem is that my dog refused to wear them. This is something you probably have to start out using when they are puppies - then they are okay with it. My dog refused to have any part of them."
4,GOES BEYOND FROGGER BEYOND,"I really liked Frogger Beyond, but I love Zapper. The cool thing about Zapper is you can zap your enemies with a standard zap or a super zap. While playing Frogger Beyond I kept wishing that Frogger had some kinda attack. Well Zapper does and it's a cool additive to Frogger Beyond-type gameplay. The graphics are crisp and clean. There are beautifully designed worlds with challenging levels. A fun game for all ages."
3,Dissapointment.,This title was okay but I thought it could have been much better. I would say its a cheap ripoff of crash bandicoot. Im 20 and am having a very hard time getting into this game enough to play it all the way through. The movement is somewhat hard to adjust to and I find the gameplay itself somewhat boring. The boards are nice looking but thats where I think the ripping off of crash came into play. I spent 7 dollars on this game new and was dissapointed. I guess if you have nothing better to play it might be alright but I would highly recommend something else.
2,What kind of game is this?,Who would wanna get this game? Its real messed up. The story is dumb and the levels are hardly detailed. The only thing that i like bout this game is the resolution(resolution is like if you slice a tree with a sword it will fall down or you go through bushes and they fall down) this game had real good resolution. If you wanna waste money go ahead and get this game.
2,Not worth it,"I bought this to replace the current iron that just wasn't cutting it - also a Sunbeam. Paid $20 at Target. My parents have a Sunbeam that works well - a slightly different model. This iron advertises as no spit - but it did just that the first time I used it. Didn't get the wrinkles out of an oxford shirt, so, back to Target. I got the highly rated Black & Decker D2020 instead for about $40. It works great. It has a digital readout, which I don't care about, the auto shut-off, of course, and it's weighty, which might help. I would suggest checking it out."
1,The company sent the wrong model.,"it is simular but not the same model and I wouldn't have bought it had I known it was going to be a bait and switch. I will not order anything on line again. The iron they sent takes a lot longer to heat up and it has a few ""added"" features I hate. Never again!"
2,Worst!,"This game is not good at all. The game was made for an arcade and therefore works properly with arcade controls, in this case the big sniper rifle. Playing this game with joysticks is such a pain. I would give this game five stars if I was playing it in an arcade. Aiming and shooting with that big gun is simple. You can move the gun to a target as fast as you want. With joysticks, however, you go at a constant rate. If you have the speed set too slow you will never beat the missions before you are killed. If you have it too fast and go too far, you have to tap the joystick over bit by bit until you are on target, in the meantime you're getting shot by 10-20 people and you have NO chance. So, as my rating says...this game is one of the worst!"
5,Silence the Enemys....and have fun!!!,"I played Silent Scope 1: It was Great!I played Silent Scope 2: It was Great!I nervously awaited Silent Scope 3 and....... It is great.The two games (silent scope ex and 3) are very different: While ex has a bit more ""realistic"" Feeling, 3 has the most intuitive Story/Ending you've ever seen in a shooting game.Explosions are looking great, bullet time is very COOL, now used more often.Music and Sounds are great as allways (release a Soundtrack, PLEASE)But I'm still VERY angry because there's no lightgun.Anyway:If you like sniping for rescuing the world, THIS IS YOUR GAME!!I HOPE THERE WILL BE A 4th PART"
4,Concentrate your reading,"For the military history devotee this is a ""must book"" which I plan to use with 20 friends next April ""on site"". Well researched, easy to locate the camps on the maps and an honor to the victims that their misery and deaths will not be forgotten and be a reminder that this is still happening around the world but we ignore and stand impotently by doing nothing. How could such a sophisticated country as Germany be so mislead?Therefore it can happen anywhere."
5,She really didn't do it!,"This was an excellent book! I have always been interested in this case and it was thorough in examining all of the evidence and testimony presented at the inquest and trial. The books leaves you with several suspects to choose from that could have committed the crime, none of them Lizzie or her immediate family members. There are plenty of newspaper clippings and excerpts from historical documents to substantiate Masterston's findings. Definitely an enjoyable read."
1,If I can save one person...,"I was taken in by the reviews, but being a Lizze Borden ""fan"", this is by far the worst book I have ever read about her. Mr. Masterson comes off as someone who has deciphered this most perplexing puzzle, when all he is really doing is commentating on other books and resources. He has found the answer! I think not. He seems to harp away (one can only suppose this is his strongest belief) on the fact that Abby was killed at the same time or AFTER Mr. Borden. Coagulated blood, cool body and stomach contents mean nothing to Mr. Masterson, for he does not believe it! And if she killed both victims at the same time, she must not be quilty! Huh? Save yourself money and let this self-published ""eureka"" stay where it is...presumably lining Mr. Masteron's shelf. If I can save one person the cost and time wasted reading this drivel, I will consider it my contribution to ""Lizophiles"" everwhere."
5,Lizzie Borden: Lizzie Didn't Do It!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Lizzie Borden was acquitted by the superior court, but hung by public opinion for the hatchet murders of her parents around the turn of the century. It's been a sensation for true-crime junkies ever since. This particular book does not present a far-fetched or ridiciulous explanation of what really happened that day. The explanation he gives is entirely plausible... and, yes, he does suggest who the murderer was."
5,SO FAWKING PSYCHED!!!,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BRAND NEW DOESN'T JUST ROCK, THEY ARE ROCK. FROM BAYSIDE, TO TBS TO BRAND NEW...THE LOG ISLAND SCENE MUST HAVE SOMETHING IN THE MILK...I DIDN'T THINK IT COULD GET BETTER THEN DEJA ENTENDU. A BUDDY OF MINE PUT ME ON THAT ALBUM EARLY IN MID 04'. YEA, I DIDN'T LISTEN TO ANYTHING ELSE, BUT THAT ALBUM FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR, I BECAME OBSESSIVE. IT HAD TO BE STOPPED, SO I PICKED UP A FEW NEW ALBUMS, BUT STILL RELAPSED A FEW MORE TIMES BITH DEJA. NOW THIS, HONESTLY, I'M SCARED, I MAY VERY WELL FALL INTO YET ANOTHER BRAND NEW HOLE IN WHICH NO OTHER SOUND ON THE PLANET CAN BE HEARD BUT THE NOISES COMING FROM THIS RECORD, MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY THANK YOU GUYS! I'LL BE OOC FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS!! OH YEA, I'LL SEE YOU IN MUNICH ON THE 26TH!! 1ST TIME, I MITE O.D."
3,Good...but not great,"I don't know how clear I can make this. I love Brand New's first 2 albums with a passion, from start to finish...this one, however, is just different. And not even a change like 1st album to 2nd...it just doesn't seem as much like Brand New. What I've always loved most about them are the lyrics and in this one they just aren't as sharp and witty. Trust me this album does have its moments and is definetly worth a listen to but there are only a few good tracks. Track 1 being the best. 2 and 3 are okay but the 2nd sounds more like a song by the Lost Prophets than Brand New. As the album goes on it doesn't seem to change much and it gets boring...there are few tracks where there isn't even singing and not that the music is bad I just don't feel like it needed to be included by its self...Now, listen. I am dissapointed by this CD...but I can't seem to take it out of my CD player."
5,perfection,"you couldnt possibly ask for a better record. i didnt much care for weapon, loved deja entendu, but this album is an absolute classic in all sense of the word. it took me a year and some to even realize they had released a new record, and immediately got it, and i never stop listening to it. sometimes they can be a lil on the depressing side but it doesn't matter this is music the way its supposed to be made; it'll send chills down your spine."
4,The Devil and God are Raging inside me,"This cd is amazing. Before this came out, I was a mild fan of brand new-I liked Your Favorite Weapon's poppish rock sound, and Deja Entendu's dark lyrics. This cd isn't like any of those. This cd is like the devil and God-parts of it range from quiet and sweet to loud, swelling and chilling. Lyrics never fail to have meaning behind them. This is definitely a cd that will not get as much recognition as it deserves because its musical style is not popular with ""mainstream"" radio. It impressed me, and it's a cd I can listen to everyday and not get tired of.Musical content: 5/5Lyrics: 5/5The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because, well, nothing is perfect."
4,pretty good album,"If you're a brand new fan, then this album is a must have. I like them pretty well, but mainly bought this for the song degausser, which is a great tune. I bought it on vinyl because i suppose i'm somewhat of a hipster and dig my records, HA."
3,Worthwhile but a step down,"Note: I am a massive fan of Brand New's 2 previous albums, but this record shakes them from my list of favorite groups.A departure from the more emo vocal style used on both previous albums, Jesse seems very comfortable with the band's new sound, but the music here simply doesn't carry the impact of those albums. The lyrics are as tongue in cheek as you'd expect, but the sardonic attitude towards relationships is replaced with a vague yet persistent irritation with organized Christianity, which isn't as charming or as convincing as his (charaded) superiority complex expressed in songs like Okay I Believe You from Deja Entendu. A less inspired album, and I almost prefer the 9 demos the band released earlier this year (the version of Sowing Season on the demo is much prefered to this cd version), but the songs are good on the average with several highlights (namely: Millstone, Degausser, and Limousine)."
3,"Yeah, well. . .","Lacey and Co. are definitely attempting to do something revolutionary with this album, but they fall short. There are lots of interesting sounds and the snippets of lyrics you can understand are fairly thoughtful, but overall Brand New just don't have the songs anymore. Because, regardless of emotional growth, that's the only thing that counts at the end of the day, and anyone who really wants to make a difference with their music better have some awesome songs.These are just mediocre."
4,"Growth in ""Punk""?","It makes me a little itchy when I see some of the reviews for this album.I'm not really a fan of most of these kinds of bands, maybe because I'm22 and would rather listen to more mature music and I don't enjoy going to shows with a sea of 14 year old kids. Songs like Jesus Christmight be a little to out of the ordinary for a kid that climaxes over thenew my chemical romance album.Give me a break. This album might be a little to grown up and too big to fit in your locker. Give it a coupleyears. I'm pretty sure you'll grow into it. The one things that buggedme most about it was the instrumentals, after three years in waiting Ithink we deserved 13 full songs. But yeah it's a pretty sweet disc."
4,"Well crafted, yet depressing","This band definitely has talent. They craft their music very well. Plus, they hit at very real and personally challenging themes. I appreciate their honesty and their abilities as artists. However, I must say that this CD is definitely not one that I find myself wanting to listen to very often. The title is very fitting and the music, thoroughly expressive of it. And that being so, it can be very depressing -- sometimes even a bit scary and unsettling in it's melodies. Don't listen to this one when you're depressed or you'll find yourself in a deeper hole than before you started."
1,A Bad Wan,"Please do not be misled by the product reviews. This is not the Brand New you know and love. This is garbage. This album is largerly forgetable. Do you like hooks? I understand this is not meant to be pop, but there are no hooks at all in this albun. Certainly a disapointment for this long-awaied album. Buy something else."
3,"eh, it's okay","When I first listened to this album, I was disappointed, and disappointment turned into a feeling of being betrayed. I'm a long fan of Deja Entendu (and to a lesser extent Your Favorite Weapon), and this album is so radically different in style, lyrical content, production quality, musical overtones -- basically in every way possible -- that it was like listening to a different band.Now with a couple months between me and it's release, a few things come to mind: Deja Entendu was radically different from Your Favorite Weapon. There are still plenty of enjoyable tracks -- namely the ones that were adapted from the ones that were leaked onto the internet a few months prior. Sometimes you're angry and you want angry music.It's no Deja Entendu for sure. It's not of the same style, and it's definitely not of the same level of perfection and brilliance, but it is still Brand New, and it is still alright music."
3,Oh Brand New..,"Being a HUGE fan of Brand New, I'm really disappointed to say that this CD is not spectacular. The first time I listened, I couldn't even finish all 12 tracks, but being such a follower, I decided to give it another chance. Some songs grew on me, most didn't. I am so used to the raw emotion of their lyrics, lyrics that send chills through my bones. But on this new album, compared to their last two, the lyrics are very mundane... the ones you can actually understand, anyway. There is a lot of unnecessary screaming which does nothing but dilute the strong powerful voice that Jesse Lacey has. The same goes with all the harmonizing. It isn't needed.Well, all in all, The album is at a higher level of decent. Besides the fact that the album was WAY WAY WAY over produced, there are still a handful of good songs.. As well as a few really awful ones. Three and a half stars. =("
5,they are awsome,not many people where i live know about Brand New so when i found it on iTunes i was surprised that i hadnt know about this band. but i LOVe their music and now all of my friends listen to them too.
5,"Haunting; Mesmerizing, This album will Rage inside you!","This is the most finely crafted batch of songs I have ever experienced. Brand New's TDAGARIM offers a haunting and mesmerizing experience. You feel the emotions of each verse and the potency of each chord. Not a moment is wasted in this emotional thriller of a disc. Cheers to Brand new. almost 5 years after the release, this album still raises the hairs on the back of my neck."
5,Hubby Loves It,"Quite a bit different from their last CD (which my husband and I LOVE), but no less wonderful. Very emotional music- listen carefully!"
4,A Basic Course in Manual Communication.,"I first saw this book at the local library where I was looking for introductory books on ASL. At last, I found this book at the local book store. I had read it all earlier but I bought it just for use by people I know. Its a really good book with lucid and easy to remember signing patterns with common words and letters that go together. The illustrations are very nice, clear and show how the hands should move flawlessly from one letter to another when finger spelling. The lessons are arranged in a good manner so that its easy to remember the signs and reproduce them.I would certainly recommend this book to people who are starting out on ASL whether hearing or deaf."
5,The sign book that clarifies,The great thing about this book is that it is organized into signs that are similar looking to each other. This helps one to learn the subtle differences between signs.
3,Unnecessarily Difficult in the Wrong Places,"Oh what could have been! Haven could have been one of the truly great video games ever: great graphics, good story line, great variety of skills that it tests, many fun-filled hours. Sadly, the makers seem to have taken a perverse joy in making many of the tasks so needlessly long, tedious and darn near impossible, that the average gamer simply throws his/her hands up in despair. What's more, there are no cheats to speak of or any way of moving to a new mission if (when!)you encounter one of the maddeningly difficult tasks, that most will simply give up (if they haven't already smashed the disc to pieces). For example: the battle at sea leading to the Isle of Heroes. The final battle against the Pirate Galleon is beyond challenging, it reaches the point of absurdity. You'd have to be a gamer masochist to continue. You simply cannot win. So save your money, yes, even nine bucks, until these guys revise Haven and make it the game it could have been."
4,A really nice fairy tale world to explore,"I heard a lot about the control problems of HAVEN and was reluctant in buying the title. However, there was a good sale at a local department store and I decided to buy it. I was not disappointed and am very happy with the game.The story line is nice and the graphics are very good. You'll be kept very busy as there are numerous challenges and things to constantly find in the game. The issue about the yo-yo weapon is somewhat valid. It isn't easy to control, but you can master the device after some practice. After that, you should be able to enjoy the game to its fullest. When I first started this game, there were no load times at all. The game was so seamless that I didn't even know that the game had started after the first video sequences were finished. :)For an action-adventure game, HAVEN will give you lots of entertainment value for the buck as well as a very big world to enjoy and explore."
2,don't waste your money,"It's not often that I regret spending a mere $5 on a game...but this game really makes me want my $5 back. The graphics are cheesy (worse than some ps1 games), the dialogue is corny, the music and sound effects are irritating. I found myself muting the volume at times to make gameplay more tolerable. Some levels are ridiculously easy, some are ridiculously hard. There's no real climbing skill level. Many of the levels get monotonous, making you perform the same kind of actions over and over and over again. The story could have been good, but all the other elements drag it down. A sore disappointment. Never played a game by these people before and I doubt I will again."
1,worst hype ever!!! do not buy this game,"though ambitious in design Haven fails in every way. This game is virtually unplayable. From frustrating camera controlle to cheap deaths. The main weapon is a yo-yo like contraption that is so difficult to aim you often die trying to hit a basic enemy. The game is hard by virtue of it's controle issues not beacause it presents anything challenging gameplay wise. Basically Haven is not fun to play, period.also the first thing you see upon placing this game in your ps2 is the word loading flashing over and over.... for a game ment to never have no load times why did the developer decide to start with a loading screen when it could have eaisily made some opening animation ot cover this up... just like everything else in this game sloopy slow and devoid of any thing closely resembling creativity..."
4,Fun,Clean fun. The menu is hard to use and the dvds are not the best quality. We had to send back for a replacement.
4,This Donald Duck DVD set is very entertaining,"This DVD set has a lot of the best Donald Duck cartoons that I remembered from when I was little (I am 23).The picture quality of the DVDs is ok, it's neither good nor bad; it's better than VHS and normal TV quality, but that's it.I'd still recommend this DVD set fully, because it contains so many Donald Duck classics. The shorts which were particularly interesting were some of the DD cartoons which were made during the war as propaganda: they are still funny and rare, and I can't remember seeing these on TV.In short, if you love(d) watching Donald Duck cartoons then you'll like this DVD set, and in that case it's a must buy."
4,Good set but the picture quality........lacking,"Donald is my favorite of the ""Fab 5"" of Disney main characters. I just call them ""The Fabs"".Was glad to add this set to my collection.Good to see my 2cd favorite, Goofy, in a couple of the cartoons.But, for the down side. I had read the reviews posted here.I agree with the people who mentioned how badly some of the cartoons looked. ALL, NOT SOME, OF THESE CARTOONS SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESTORED & LOOK PERFECT.The fuzz, unclean, old prints of these cartoons I did not appreciate at all. A real let down to fans."
2,unbelievable VHS-Quality on a Disney Tin,"First I thought my DVD/Beamer were wrong because of the poor quality one can notice after one second but sad fact is that these DVDs were obviously taken from old TV-masters, unlike earlier Tins.They start saving at the backbone of the(ir own) Disney Studio! The end of civilization! How great the older ones look, like watching FILM, and this is like watching an old video. All these great cartoons. Why limit such an edition? Why put signatures of enthusiast Maltin and Roy Disney on it when this means nothing?So not only these shorts are a thing of the past, even good DVD-quality is - just a few years after ists promising beginnings! I demand a remastered edition at least half priced for a ""proof of purchase"".Why stop restoring when Blu-Ray is on the horizon?? Then the bad quality is even more noticable. Or do they want to sell then AGAIN and THEN the restored version?"
5,"Oh, yeah?","Another great collection of Donald Duck cartoons. One thing that I find odd, is the inclusion of the charity short ""The Volunteer Worker"", which was already onThe Chronological Donald, Volume One. Althought it was an Easter Egg there, so some people may not have seen it."
1,All OF THEM!,"Why can't this second volume of Donald Duck finish up all the Duck's cartoons. and why is ""The Volunteer Worker"" being shown again?"
1,Better tracking for item in shipping,"This is a Christmas gift, but I still have not receive yet.I have no way to track the item in shipping."
5,Hymn texts to new music,"These are not your mom & dad's hymns! (They're better!) They are solid, biblically-informed texts by respected hymn writers set to new, modern pop & rock style music without being over-produced. Matthew Smith is a gifted writer and singer from the Indelible Grace group of musicians (of which Derek Webb & Sandra McCracken of Caedmon's Call fame, are also a part). My favorite track is ""Jesus I Am Resting."" Most are congregationally singable and the ones which aren't as easy are great for devotional listening."
2,"drawing all right, story can be improved","Read this book with my son. The author tried to write the story in a dramatic way, but the story is not very decent and the writing is weak. Will not read it again."
2,Not an Authoritative Study,"While this book has the trappings of an academic monograph, it is in fact little more than a basic narrative cobbled together from translated sources. The author provides little real analysis and has only a limited grasp of the actual historical source base, instead working through the translations of others. The result is a well-intentioned, but ultimately unsatisfying work full of both minor and major mistakes of fact and interpretation. It is perhaps slightly better than what might be available in English (in one volume) at this point, but those seeking a serious and nuanced understanding of this conflict, should best look elsewhere."
3,Read carefully,"Read carefully. This is a micro-fiber blazer, but note that it is DRY CLEANING only -- not the kind of ""throw it in the washing machine"" and you're ready for battle blazer that a company such as LL Bean would sell. Also, the fabric is a slightly heavier neo-suede that is a bit heavier than you would expect. One more thing: note the reference to a ""covered placket"" over the buttons. I had no idea what that meant. It's the kind of tailoring that one usually sees in women's jackets. Not a funky, wear it with jeans blazer, in other words.Nice lining, though."
1,A good waste of time a C-movie,"Don't waste your time on this movie the plot it not there, there is not really any material of interest looks like some kids took a camera in high school and just started fliming to film."
4,Very good for the most part,"I was very happy when I got my order. The DVD set was brand new so the DVD's were in good shape with no scratches. The only slight disappointment was the condition of the box. The edges were quite smashed in, I'm assuming, from transport or other handling or storage."
5,They Live Again,If you loved the first season you are going to love this one. Though They don't have the rest of the season released I enjoyed seeing the second season of this seres. Lisa's brother turns into a cat like creature and has a clan of his own now. It get's better brooklyn becomes the future leader of the Gargoyles and we learn some history of the chracters not to menchin Macbeth and King Arther. I hope disney releases the rest of the season buy the way.
5,Shouldn't be missed...,"This was the natural progression to having ordered Season One on DVD. It is a huge hit with my older sons- 18,16 and 13, but I cannot make it passed the TV when they have these things on! The animation is great for a regular television cartoon, and the stories aren't soppy and ridiculous.Recommend it for a good-ole marathon in the evening wrapped-up in a blanket sipping whatever floats your boat....."
5,All things are true,"The Gargoyles Season 2 Vol. 1 DVD will take you into the realm of the mystic. Fairies, shape-shifters, magic, King Arthur... all things are true in one way or another. The plots and story-lines from season one are fleshed out and expanded. The series just keeps getting better and better as the episodes progress. This three-disk DVD set will leave you ravenous for more gargoyles! (Hopefully Gargoyles Season 2 Vol. 2 will come out soon! I can't wait!)"
5,Best,"I just love the Gargoyles! it was my fav tv show, UNTIL they took it away from us!! i can;t believe it went away when it has such a HUGE following!!?? but oh well, anyway- this DVD is the coolest and you should def buy it! i cant wait till the second volume comes out.. i hope its soon!"
5,Myth Meets Cartoon,"Gargoyles was a series that combined comedy, fantasy, folklore, and mythology all in one to produce a modern twist on many literary treasures. Creatures that are stone by day come to life when the sun goes down and become warriors defending New York City from common criminals to supernatural beings. Encounter Shakespeare's Macbeth, or even the legendary King Arthur, the Gargoyle series travels from one subject to the next. With an excellent cast of voices, outstanding writing, and wonderful animation this is a must for every adult and child."
1,"Great Show Yes, but Poor Image quality!!!!!!","I'm so upset! The first season was perfectly encoded, beautiful colours, no noise in the night scenes...perfection.This second set is far away from that quality! there's a big ""aliasing"" (stair-step effect)on all the characters and noise is present on all the lay-outs...just like the Batman set.It's shame for none of you fans spoke of the real DVD content.It's something to say you love the show, but we already know that.The quality is so low i was shocked, it's really annoying to see those beautiful episodes in those conditions. I just can't understand why they didn't keep up the good work!"
5,Still amazing ten years later,"As excited as I was about season one coming to DVD last year, season two is even more exciting. This was when the series really began to branch out, to deepen and expand its storylines, to explore all sorts of new territory Disney had never dared to explore before.Supporting characters included everyone from Puck, the fae trickster, to Odin, the Norse god; from MacBeth, king of Scotland, to Arthur Pendragon, high king of Britain. We discovered the secret of Demona's immortality, traveled back in time with Xanatos, visited Avalon with Goliath, and learned the fate of the gargoyle eggs orphaned in 994.Every episode answered old questions and raised new ones, gave us insight on the characters, and simply entertained us as it did. I can't ask for more than that. I can't recommend any show more highly."
5,Gargoyles: Season 2 Volume 2 is in danger,"Aparently the second volume of the second season of Gargoyles is in danger of not being released. If sales do not pick up the second volume will not be released. I can tell you, being a viewer myself, that Gargoyles is an amazing DVD. It is worth your money and you won't regret it. So please, spare a few dollars and buy the first two DVDs. Remember that the die-hard fans won't have their second volume if volumes don't pick up in selling. So please, don't ruin it for the rest of us. Buy the DVDs. I can garuntee that you will not be disappointed.Gargoyles rule! ;-P"
2,A tad repetitious,"This book is good for beginneres, but I didn't find all that much new info and I found it somewhat repetitious throughout, like the authors needed fillers."
2,Perhaps it's fake,"The title of the product in Amazon says ""Wings By Giorgio Beverly Hills For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3 Ounces"". It clearly states that it's made ""BY GIORGIO BEVERLY HILLS"". I bought the one sold by the seller Tuccini (recommended by Amazon) and neither the box nor the perfume bottle say ""BY GIORGIO BEVERLY HILLS"", it only says ""wings"". This is suspicious and makes me think that it may be a generic or fake perfume. It smells like the original Wings By Giorgio Beverly Hills but it last about 2 hours only and the smell is not that strong as the original.If you are planning on buying a substitute for the ORIGINAL Wings By Giorgio Beverly Hills, go ahead and buy it, it's cheap. BUT BE AWARE that Giorgio Beverly Hills's brand DOES NOT APPEAR anywhere in the package and it may well be a fake or generic product of LOWER QUALITY."
5,WINGS perfume and/or cologne,"I have been wearing this fragrance ever since it first appeared on the market...and STILL love it!Every time I wear it, there are always people who tell me how GOOD I smell! It is light and never smells too strong.I also enjoy the lotion...the scent lasts a REALLY long time. I wear that in the winter months.I was happy to find it on line and will continue to purchase it through Amazon.Regarding the lady's comment about the possibility of it not being the AUTHENTIC ""Wings"", I really feel that it is the REAL THING...and have no problems with the scent fading, as she described.I could be wrong, but I've been wearing it long enough that I think I know the real thing!"
5,ALVIS,GREAT PRICE COMPARED TO RETAIL STORES. GREAT SCENT GENTLEMEN FOR YOUR LADY. WINGS IS A VERY QUALITY FRAGANCE AND PRODUCT. MEN'S WINGS IS GREAT AS WELL. I GET ALOT OF COMPLIMENTS. SHE'LL LOVE IT!
1,you have send me the oly box not my perfumeand charge me $52.50 insted of $20.81 CHEATERS,"In my order you have send me the empty box ,there was no perfume what I ordered and charged me $52.50. insted of $20.81.should I give this to channal 13 to let the world know that your co. is cheating to people. I am very very upset"
5,Love the scent......,This is the perfume I love to use. Gave it a 5 rating because shipping was very fast and the price is just too good. Will be buying more whenever I run out. Recommend it to all my friends and workmates. Keep up the good work.
2,Is this a fake ?,"I used to wear this fragrance years ago and loved it. When I searched for it on Amazon, and found it, I did see a review that commented on the apparent lack of authenticity of the product. I ordered it anyway (it all looked legit) but my perfume has arrived today and even though it smells the same (the longevity of which has yet to be determined), the box and bottle do not state 'Giorgio Beverly Hills' anywhere ! The paperwork attached says it, but the box does not. And the bottle does not even have the words 'WINGS' on it. I definitely remember my previous bottle having the name in gold letters along the side of the bottle. I am convinced this is a fake bottle of fragrance that might as well have been bought at a local flea market. I'll keep the bottle (it's cheap as chips) but next time I wouldn't order something that is not the genuine article."
1,Still waiting for the Sea Monkeys.....,"I got this for my kids, and we have been waiting and waiting and still don't see anything. We followed all the instructions to the letter, but nothing has happened. All we see is little particles floating around and it's been 11 days. Shouldn't we be seeing something? I mean I know they are supposed to be small, but I don't think this worked for us."
1,Dead on Arrival,"Well, after following the directions perfectly we have absolutely zero life. I was excited to share with my wife and kids what they have never seen before. Unfortunately, they have seen water before and that is all that was on Mars. Total dud."
4,Sea Monkeys are back and better than ever!!,"This is one of the best sea-monkey kits ever! It comes with everything you need to start your own sea-monkey colony. It also has great landscaping unlike the Ocean-Zoo tanks that only have landscaping at the bottom. If you are looking for a pet that requires minimal care, this is it, It's a must buy!!"
4,my experiance with the sea monkeys,"i had got the sea monkeys on mars from toys r us , through amazon.com. set them up to hatch and grow , , it had looked like they where not gonna grow . but in one day in turned around and they had grown , and where swimming around. there great to watch. i got to say they look happy!!!!!!!!!"
5,The Sea Monkeys are a hit!,"I set up this sea monkey tank on my desk at my office. My baby sea monkeys are growing rapidly and are enjoyed by all my coworkers! Whenever I get stressed out, I just take five and watch the little guys swim around, then I am recharged and ready to jump back into my tasks. Thanks, sea monkeys!"
2,Hmmmm,"We did as the instructions said. Quite a few monkeys hatched, but quickly died off. There were only 3 left after we got to the first feeding day per the packaging and they were gone before we got to the plasma kit. The kids liked setting it up and watching them hatch, but quickly lost interest."
5,the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love this tank!! its harder to tip over the tank(but the lid is loose).buy this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great Fairy Tale Read,"I really enjoyed the book ""Spindles End"" by Robin Mckinly. It is a different version of the classic tale of ""Sleeping Beauty.""I would recomend this book to anyone who likes romances, adventures, or fairy tales. This book combines all three perfectly.I loved how the main character(Rosie) was very different than you would think a princess would be like. She is not so pretty, she is a smiths apprentice, and hates wearing dresses. My favorite Rosie moment was when she cut her long blond curly hair short.I rated this book a four, because it was exiting, heart warming, romantic, and kept you on the edge of your seat."
3,A Good Read,"It wasn't her best work, but it was still good. She twisted the fairy tale into something I'd never think of. The ending was interesting but a little disappointing. I also found myself getting lost in the words at times, like I didn't know what was going on. Still it was nice story."
3,not the best,Spindle's End wasn't Robin Mckinley's best book but then again i never have really liked her fairy tales. The story was kind of confusing at times because there were so many characters. It was also too long and could have been shortened without so many descriptions of animals and her life. The ending was unrealistic but quite satisfiying. Overall the book was ok.
2,Spindle ends...finally,"You know how you think you don't like Thai food, or MacDonalds, or crayfish; and then you go for ages without eating any and you think, ""Hey, maybe I'm remembering it wrong"" and you try it again and go 'OK, so THAT's why I don't like Thai food."" This is how Spindle's End made me feel about YA historical fantasy. I *love* retold fairy tales, and Sleeping Beauty is one of my favourites, but this is so muddled up and tangled with clauses and double-negatives and just plain dull writing that I couldn't enjoy it. Also, nothing dark or sexy about it, without which retold fairy tales are just..fairy tales. Unlike say,Happy Ever After (Definitions)which was a least very cute and clever, there's just nothing here outside the cliches. I don't mind books that are frustrating or disturbing, but being boring is just a deal-breaker. I coudlnt' wait to reach the end of this particular spindle."
1,A Major Drag,"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. There were about thirty pages devoted to just WAITING. I mean, who wants to read for thirty pages about how Rosie doesn't like how she must wait? It took me two weeks to finish this book, an all time high for me. The pace was so slow that I couldn't wait to finish it. This was a 400 and something page novel that should have been about 100 pages long--or less.I LOVED Chalice, Beauty, the Blue Sword, and Hero's Crown by Robin McKinley, so I was very disappointed by this novel."
3,A bit too slow,"I couldn't wait for this story to end. I love a good fairy tale retelling, but there were just so many words for so little going on. The end was just a jumble of incomprehensible magic, and I didn't like the way it wrapped up, any ways. It would have been better shorter. just too much filler. McKinley's Deerskin is a much better option."
2,Disappointing,"I have been a fan of Robin McKinley's writing since I was in elementary school (1980's!) when I read ""The Hero and the Crown"". Sadly, the last few books she has written have been disappointing. Spindle's End has an enchanting beginning, and the character development was interesting, but despite it all, I read the book with only halfhearted interest. I felt that interesting characters were only half explored. Interpersonal relationships were too perfectly good or bad without that wonderful complexity that pulls you into them. I miss the days when this author was spinning a story and makes you never want to leave the world you're in."
5,Spindle's End: Robin McKinley,"Sleeping Beauty is perhaps the most passive fairy tale heroine. She is threatened, pricks her finger, sleeps for a long time and wakes up in time to get married. A lovely, languid lady whose role in the tale is simply to lie there.Not Rosie, the threatened princess of ""Spindle's End"". She has far better things to do with her time and an attractive cast of characters to assist her.This is another marvellous effort by McKinley, both enchanting and convincing. The author has that certain rare talent of constructing a world which is truly 'faerie', instead of extruded fantasy product. Compelling, delightful and completely satisfying."
2,A bit slow and somehow un-edited,"I bought this after having read several other McKinley books and loving them to pieces. This one was much slower and dryer. Also, I got the impression that the editing was poorly done, or not done at all. There were sentances that didn't end, and jumps in action that made no sense. I found the ending a bit unsatisfying too, but that is strictly opinion."
2,Not as good as Rose Daughter or Beauty,I love fairy tales! I was so excited to see the author of Beauty had another retelling. Spindles End has me very confused. I am plugging through it and hope when I am done with it a second time I can give it more stars. I would not recommend it for younger readers.
2,Stands Out...As a Bad Book,"I'm surprised at all the good reviews this book got. Not to be snide, I just genuinely am.This book looms in my memory as the one book I had to drag myself to finish. A book that made me tear up with boredom. The plucky heroine wasn't likable, the names were all forced and strange (none making sense in a universe together--more like an assortment of characters from different books) , not on the unique side, really.I thought any originality forced and unfounded, and wished it would have turned out better for me, especially as the ""magic dust"" theory was such a nice start.The ending wasn't predictable, but it was trying so very hard NOT to be, it couldn't possibly have been anything but what it was: Dull.With all these good reviews, and me not having read it in years, it might be worth trying, but I stand firm: take it out of the library."
3,Perhaps to much poetic prose,"Although I did like the book, it lacked the straightforwardness that Beauty has always had. As McKinley has written more and more books, her descriptive talents have grown. I saw it starting to happen in Rose Daughter, but it culminated in Spindle's End- her descriptive elements overrode the book. I found myself thinking, ""Get on with it!"" as I read and fighting the urge to skip ahead for the first time. Even though I genuinely adored Rosie, I also agree with other reviewers- I saw too much of McKinley's other heroines in Rosie's character."
3,If it weren't this author...,"I'd have rated it a little higher. But I know what McKinley is capable of, and this isn't her best work. It's a little unfocused, and towards the end, the plot started to waver a bit. Character development is not as strong, either. It's a good read, but not prime McKinley."
3,Verry Good!,"I relly liked this book because of the charters. I loved how Robin Mckinly described them. It also reminded me of her Damar seris (which introduced me to her in the first place) alittle all throught the book and alot in a few part. I read it a while ago and can't quite remember it now, but it was relly good.(sorry if this is borring and repetative, I stink at writing reviws but wanted to try.)"
3,Good but not good enough,"When I first found this book, I expected great things out of it. Now, after reading and re-reading the book I sadly announce that if did not fulfil my expectations. The book has a great begining and a fascinating ending. Still, during the middle of the book (which was way too long and filled with unecessary details), I found myself bored. Robin Mckinely only gives you a glance at the main human characters (Rosie, Peony, Rowland, etc.) and even though the animals have vivid characteristics, there are simply too many and they blend together. The sentences in the book seem to run together while reading and Robin does not give enough details about the setting to really see it. She leaves many mysteries unsolved but does a great job of giving a familiar fairy tale an unusual twist. I would still recommend reading this book but be warned, it is not as good as her earlier works."
2,Robin McKinley's great but this one lost me.,"I'm an avid reader and usually love Robin McKinley but this one was painful to get through. At first, I enjoyed the plot but by the second half, it stopped making sense. The entire ending seemed pointless and unpurposeful, and although Petunia's love plot was nice, Rosie was in love with a 40 year old man. I'm sorry but if you want to read Robin McKinley, read The Blue Sword."
1,"This re-telling of a classic fairy tale put the ""sleep"" in Sleeping Beauty","Wow - talk about a slow read! The tale of ""Sleeping Beauty"" is one of my very favorites, so I picked this up with great enthusiasm. Unfortunately, this re-telling failed to capture the magic part of a fairy tale retelling. I just didn't enjoy it at all. Maybe it was a case of high expectations making it seem worse than it was... McKinley definitely displayed some originality in the story itself, but overall, it was the style was that spoiled the book. No actual action took place at all... And the verb tenses were almost all passive, making the novel all just ""telling"", resulting in a very slow-going and boring book! What a disappointment! I have enjoyed McKinley's books in the past, but this really isn't a good example of her talent!"
3,Expected 'Beauty',"First off, this is a really slow read. And towards the end, it just gets slower. I skimmed a good deal of the last 9,000 pages. I haven't done that since 'Breaking Dawn.' I really wanted to enjoy this book, and I did for the first part - albeit the sluggish pace of everything. And towards the ending, the twists get stupider and less interesting. I still respect Robin McKinley, but really, just re-read Beauty. Like I did. For like, the eightieth time."
5,My Favourite Book,"This book is the best fiction story I've ever read. It's a beautifully woven re-telling of Sleeping Beauty. I've read many Robin McKinley books, but this one overrides them all! The last page and a half is my favourite of the entire story. This book is no where near boring, it is romantic with a great story line with interesting twists, and I could not put it down... even the second time I read it and I plan to read it many more times.I LOVE THIS BOOK!!"
3,Spindle's End,This book was over all good but it starts out boring and stays that way for quite some time. The author reflects to much on Rosie's childhood and waits for the exciting parts till part 5 (the last part). I was a little dissapointed but if u can make it to the end then it gets good and its worth the read.
5,A Beautiful retelling of my favorite fairy tale,"Once I started this book I couldn't put it down. The book is beautifully written. I must warn those of you tradtionally lovers of fairy tales. This book is not the fairy tale. Yes, it has the same story line, but it is a completely diffrent story. The ending is a total surprise."
2,Like slogging through a marsh,"I'm a big fantasy fan, so I was interested to find this retelling of Sleeping Beauty. Unfortunately, I was not impressed. The author's writing style (at least in this book; I haven't read her others) was *very* slow. She seemed to have a problem with sentences shorter than, say, 9 words. Also, she never said anything directly, which I found infuriating at times.Still, the basic plot was mostly interesting. The ending did leave me scratching my head, however. Overall, I would not recommend this book... too distracted, confusing, and s-l-o-w."
2,Too slow too unrealistic,"Though I'm an avid fan of Robin McKinley's books, this one seemed to drag on forever. Every once in a while it was enjoyable, but the characters are odd and pretty forgetable. Unlike most books I read, where there is a clear picture of what is happening in my head, this one seemed cludy and fuzzy. It's about as interesting as reading non-fiction (which I'm not to keen on, but is occasionally interesting). Blah Blah Blah. She needed to cut and shorten it up some because there is way too much fluff. If you are a fan of Robin, then I would recommend 1. The Blue Sword 2. The Hero and the Crown, and 3. the Outlaws of Sherwood before reading the Spindle's End."
3,Charming story.,"This re-telling of Sleeping Beauty adds depth of character and vivid details to flesh out the old fairy tale with fun and charming fantasy about what might have really happened to the princess between the naming-day when she is cursed, and her twenty-first birthday, when the evil witch intends to kill her -- and this lady ""does"" evil very well! The beginning chapters are bogged down by the author's heavy use of parenthetical interjections to explain background, which perhaps works if you are reading aloud to someone younger, but rapidly becomes annoying otherwise (where was the editor?!). Part Five at the end likewise drags, not from the parentheticals (which fade out about a quarter of the way into the book), but from excessive narrative in what ought to be riveting action. Still, if you finish it, you will be glad you did, because the book leaves you with a smile and a sense of satisfaction about characters you feel you have come to know and like."
2,Disappointment,"I borrowed this book from a friend and enjoyed the beginning immensly. It had a great introduction and a fresh look at Sleeping Beauty. However, I agree with other reviews that it was difficult to follow with a lot of skipping around and explanations. I was sorely disapointed with the ending of this book, I found it very unbelievable...how does a horse jump into the sky and land at a country in the clouds? It was very strange and did not flow well with the rest of the book. I do not recommend this book for anyone who enjoys the wonder and fulfillment of fairy tells, it is too much of a stretch."
3,"McKinley paints a vivid picture, but this one is a little dry","In this retelling of the classic fairy tale Sleeping Beauty, baby Rosie is whisked away and carefully hidden by fairies for nearly twenty-one years in an attempt to thwart the curse laid upon her by a vengeful evil fairy: That she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel and fall into an eternal sleep.I really enjoy McKinley's beautiful prose. Her descriptions are vivid and lifelike. However, I found the story in this retelling slow and a bit dry."
3,3 1/2 stars; made me smile,"This is a sweet, fanciful reworking of Sleeping Beauty. Read it because you like tough heroines who can work real magic with animals. Read it because you can delve into a world that seems extremely pleasant to live in. The book had certain flaws: the character of Katriona was much more compelling to me than Rosie herself. Also, the villainess was never a fully realized character. That said, a lovely way to wile away the hours,"
5,My favorite book!,"I loved this book! I wasn't very old when I read it but I understood every word of it! Robin Mckinley captured me with her words. The adventure, the magic, it pulls you in! I couldn't put the book down for three days! Anyone who loves Robin Mckinley's work should read this book! I hope I get the chance to read more of her work and soon."
3,Great beginning and middle,"As a huge fan of McKinley's Blue Sword, Hero and the Crown, and Beauty, I came in with high expectations for Spindle's End.I was enchanted by the beginning and middle, but the end seemed to drag on and on, and in a confusing fashion. It seemed as if the last third of the novel was filled with too much description, with little actually happening. Several chapters could have been edited down severely.That being said, I would probably still recommend this book, as the rest of it is charming and magical."
4,A really good read,"I really enjoy this book. I have read it several times and the first time, it was good. The second time (and everytime since) it has just gotten better and better. If you like Robin McKinley or just good fantasy, read this book."
4,Great Book,"Not as good as her other books, but still good. I would recommend some of the other books she's written a little more"
3,Kinda confusing...,"Well, I was rather dissappointed with this book. I am a big fan of McKinley's earlier work (mainly the Damar series :) and I liked Beauty, so I was expecting this book to follow along that pattern. I am glad Ms. McKinley has delved into other fairy tales apart from Beauty and The Beast, and Robin Hood, and hope she continues to do so. This book was amazing with all the new creatures and folklore surrounding the whole new land McKinley created. I liked the characters but found I got confused a lot during the story, especially after everyone was put under Pernicia's sleeping spell. I thought the plot followed Rosie's youth for a great portion, then just zipped through the whole exciting battle parts way too fast. I did not always understand the logic Rosie and Narl used when fighting Pernicia, so that took away from the story. Overall, this book was an interesting read with great writing, but lacked in plot. Better luck with the next novel from McKinley."
4,Wonderful variation of Sleeping Beauty,"Robin McKinley is very good at taking a well-known story and giving it a different spin (pun not intended). Spindle's End takes Sleeping Beauty a direction I haven't seen before while still maintaining the intrinsic appeal of the original concept.As with ""Beauty"", the characters are well defined and easy to relate to. The role of magic in the story is creative and presented in an interesting way.The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the rather awkward climax. There's a rushed feeling to it and the clear narration of the rest of the book is missing. This doesn't mean it's bad, just not quite up the the standard of the rest of the story."
3,A bit self-indulgent,"I have always enjoyed reading Robin McKinley's work and looked forward to diving into this one. However, the detailed decriptions and frequent use of parethetical phrases, made the reading rather cumbersome. The Horn review did a great summation and I agree with their comments.It's worth reading, but does not draw one in the way her other writings have before. Her desire to create a strong female hero is admirable, but I think it was a bit overdone."
5,Daydreams and Lullabies,"The most beautiful and enchanting music I have ever heard!Excellent for children and adults!Calms a crying child, and entertains the inner soul of adults!"
1,Overkill,"I returned this, after really trying hard to like it. I have large hands, and, the buttons were so small I kept hitting the wrong ones. Further, you have to delicately push back and forth one switch to go from function to function; I don't mean up and down length-wise, but, perpendicular to the layout of the switch, which is extremely counter-intuitive. Also, I could not accept having to toggle through several menu windows just to allow me to erase part of what I was dictating. I really wanted to simply use this like an old fashioned microcassette: forward, backward, erase mistakes and dictate over, but, also have the luxury of voice recognition. It flat-out did not work. Try something else!"
1,Boring,Bored out of my mind trying to watch this. I bought this as a gift. Should have rented it first because I was embarrassed that I gifted this horrible video.
2,So so....,"They are very hard to reuse since you have to boil them and they don't work very well or last very long in the first place. Mine also came in a box with a different type of heating pad depicted on the front leading me to believe the product wasn't actually ""new"" as advertised."
1,Worked once.,"This worked once - when it first arrived. I have never subsequently been able to make it work afterward. I boiled the item as instructed, and it liquefies again, but immediately hardens as it cools and does not appear to be able to be stored in it's liquefied state for later use. I even extended the boiling time just in case I was not boiling for long enough. The vinyl enclosing the red material began melting when it touched the bottom metal of the pan I used to boil with. This was probably my error, but BE CAREFUL."
5,Let the rain fall while this CD is playing,"I cannot get over this wonderful collection of the blues. I will put it on with the intention of getting something done while listening to it, but time and again, I find myself sitting on my couch, staring out the window as the music encases me. A wonderful CD to hold a mood, or just create one on its own account. A real must have."
5,LOVED IT--I LISTEN TO IT OVER AND OVER,"If you are an Andrew Vachss fan, you'll love this CD. I especially like Another Man's Woman by Marcia Ball. This is a ""Must Have"" album."
4,some powerful music,"with Buddy Guy, Leadbelly and Bazza how can you go wrong. ""BAZZA"" (?) who is this guy, does anyone know where to find info on him ? his song ""ghost"", to me, was the highlight of the album"
2,A lot of fiction!,"I loved this book when I first read it. I have since learned that much of the book is fictionalized! I knew that the win rates were exaggerated (I read a card-counting book many years ago), but was very disappointed to learn that much of the action was fiction as well. How can they sell this as non-fiction?I have a friend who says, ""Who cares? It's still a great story!"" Well, anyone can make up a great story. What I liked about this was that I thought they had really done everything in the book!"
3,I brought down this book in a matter of hours,"A very quick and enjoyable read. Mezrich recounts how the now-famous MIT Blackjack Team took Vegas for millions. The tone of the narrative is conversational; he describes the card-counting strategy in easily understood language, just as if he was telling you about it in person. He also kept a good pace going and I felt my pulse start to race when things started going really bad for the team. Fun read."
5,The Phenomenauts Rock My World!!!!,"The Phenomenauts are a killer band that'll have you skanking all day long! Once you've listened to Jamboree or 10,000 Light Years or Earth is the Best you can't stop. Their intergalactic theme is a refreshing slap in the face from all that mainstream out there. The Phenomenauts live to please and enjoi everything they do! These guys are SO AWESOME LIVE as well as on Rockets and Robots. Never miss a chance to see them because you'll miss dry ice, toilet paper, and BIG BALLS of Earth!"
2,Very dissapointed!,I ordered this CD based on the sound clips and the reviews but what I got was not what I was expecting. The vocals are drowned out by the instrumentals. At first I thought it was just my car's cd deck but same went for all the other players in the house.
3,Why Should U.K get it first?!,What a great christmas special. But why is the DVD being released in the U.K before us. Yes it is a British comedy but we are the bigger audience and we gave them the golden globes. Surely it is OUR RIGHT as Americans that we should have the DVD first?! The sitcom is mainly rehashed from American sitcom ideas anyway!I give this 3 stars. 1 taken off because it was not on our screens first and another because it was not released on DVD here first.
5,The Best Gervais,"I absolutely love this show. My wifew came across the British Office by accident, when it was on BBC and thought I would like it. She was wrong....I LOVE it. I can watch The Office (BBC) anytime, anywhere. This particular edition is the best of his Office. Very funny yet touching. The characters are so realistic. I don't think the American Office compares at all to this. If you like the OFFICE you will probably like The Extras. Equally as funny. Gervais is one of the people I would love to meet in real life."
4,THE TINIEST NOTE OF DISSENT...,"For some strange reason, I thought that it was ok that David hooked up, but I felt a little let down that Dawn came back. The show gets you and pulls your guts out a bit; Dawn coming back sort of stuffs them back in name of a happy ending. It really hits hard when Dawn opens the 'Secret Santa' gift in the taxi. Might have been better to let it end with Tim's head shots saying that 'life goes on'."
5,bbc,Love the office. Ricky Gervais is hilarious. And thanks for sharing your comedy with the state. Cheers
2,Grand music - Storyline fiction not history,"Handel's music is, of course, grand and beautiful. I applaud Susan Hammond's creativity and her hopes to introduce children to classical music. However, the fictional storyline is just that....fictional. Your (and your child's) impression and ""memories"" of Handel will forever falsely be tied to this fictional storyline of Thomas, Katerina, and Handel which never occured. There are of course elements of truth in the storyline but the majority never happened. Buy some CD's of Handel's wonderful music and listen with your family! There are several good books you can read about Handel's real life and they are not boring."
5,Hallelujah Handel,This is an excellent tool for helping children understand and enjoy classical music. Our six-year old granddaughter and four-year old grandson really enjoy it and are learning so much. We have purchased Classical Kids for other composers and find each one a delight.
5,Very good book,The book is very good. It have all information that I need. The price is excellent because the book is in very good condition.
3,must read!!,This book is a must read book for biggner programers. It presents the basic concepts of programing and problem solving technics. I found it very help-full and interesting.
2,Excellent info but flawed analysis,"I thought the authors did a good job at analyzing the whole situation in North Korea, and their solution would work except for one fatal flaw: Kim Jong Il cannot be negotiated with. Period. He is a pathological liar. He deceived us in 1994, and he will deceive us again. He lies not only to the world but to his own people. Mark my words, peace will only come when Kim Jong Il is out of power and Korea is reunited under a democratic regime. Only then will the threat be gone."
3,"Interesting insightful proposal, but drawn out too long","While this argument offers an insightful proposal on dealing with N. Korea (backed up by a great deal of stats) it should have been an article not a book. The book begins to get very repetitive fast, and offers information for the purpose of backing the argument (Grand bargain offered to N. Korea). This is not a book to tell one about life in N. Korea, its past history, or details about its Leader and his ""pleasure squad"" and Japanese kidnappings. This is a policy proposal, a very well formulated one, to deal with N. Korea right now. The argument is stretched out to fit into book form, and gets redundant after some reading. An interesting perspective, but leaves one wanting for another book."
5,"So Good, I Had to Review It","This review is the first one I've ever submitted on Amazon.com, and I had to write it because I was so pleased with this Waterman Phileas Fountain Pen set. Despite being a long-time admirer of fountain pens, I've never had the pleasure of owning a real one of high quality. The Phileas is a wonderful pen for the beginner fountain pen writer, and this set contains everything the beginner needs for its proper care, maintenance, and use. It's surprisingly lightweight, yet the craftsmanship is obvious in the nib and the design, which is a beautiful blue and gold combination. The ink flow, provided you follow the instruction booklet included, is very smooth, and I have no problems, e.g. uneven quantity, blotchiness, etc., with the Waterman cartridges included. I have not yet tried the converter with the bottle ink, so I cannot give feedback on that particular part of the set. Nevertheless, I honestly cannot see that anything can go wrong for the novice if he uses this set!"
5,A looks magnet!,"Everytime I take it out to sign, the other person reaction is always the same. They are greatly impressed! I own one but purchased a second set as a spare. It works marvelously. Ink flow is smooth so signatures are always perfect no matter the writing speed. Also, this pen looks much more expensive than it really is. It truly is a little jewel. Highly recommended."
1,Sophomore Slump,"This is one of the most disappointing purchases I've ever made. Having been a Stroke 9 fan since hearing the incredible ""Nasty Little Thoughts,"" I was optimistic and excited for their new album ""Rip it Off."" What I got was nothing like what I had come to expect from these guys and I don't recommend it at all.""Nasty Little Thoughts"" was smart, mature, original, and well developed. This new album is none of the above. The lyrics are either dumb or corny, the instrumentation is boring and uninspired, and the band seems happy to fade off into the abyss of indistinguishable punk pop bands with the likes of American Hi-Fi and SR-71.I wanted to like this album. I really did. But it just doesn't make the cut. If they release a third album, I hope it's reminiscent of their previous effort. For now, however, I recommend ""Nasty Little Thoughts"" and I recommend you leave this one on the bargain racks, where it belongs."
1,I'll make this quick...,"This album isn't no good. It's rock is brane-ded and the lymricks is not as cleaver as Nancy's Little Thoughts. I hope numbre 3 doen't not suck, because this one dos."
4,"Good, but its no ""Nasty Little Thoughts""","So many of the other reviewers have raved about this CD. There are some good songs, but Stroke 9 hasn't broken any new ground since ""Nasty Little Thoughts,"" which is actually a better album. If you want to buy only one CD by Stroke 9, I'd recommend ""Nasty Little Thoughts."" Washin' and Wonderin' is one of the best songs to come along in a while."
5,Best CD Out Right Now,"I just bought this album last week and I haven't stopped listening to it. I am a huge alt rock fan, but everything is starting to sound so generic lately. This CD is definately a breath of fresh air. There is a great combination of fun and soulful songs, all with the unique sound that characterizes Stroke 9. All of the songs are great, but my favorites are: ""Latest Disaster"" (I can't think of good adjectives to describe this song except for the fact that I can NOT stop singing it and making everyone listen to it), ""Vacuum Bag"" (a great emotional song about a past relationship), ""Do It Again"" (watching them perform that one live is what did it for me!), ""Kick Some A**"" (need I say more?), and finally ""Don't Worry"" (great breakup song). This CD always makes me feel happy and I love to pop it in when I am working out or driving somewhere. My only final thoughts on this, besides to GO OUT AND BUY IT are try to see this band live. They put on a GREAT show!!"
4,A dose of some good rock music,"I had never heard of STROKE 9 until I saw thier video at the end of the JAY AND SILENT BOB DVD for the song KICK SOME A**, which is a great song by the way. Yesterday I went to the Tower Records in San Francisco to see them do an in-store performance and I liked what I heard and decided to by the album. I think this guys are a good rock band and this CD is worth listening to and adding to your collection. Besides KICK, some other songs that I think you will enjoy are: LATEST DISASTER, 100 GIRLS, VACUUM BAG, WE WERE WRONG, DO IT AGAIN. I think that this band is a wave of fresh air for rock fans that are tired of the junk that is popular today(i.e. boy bands and the like), and I sense that this album will really blow up and be a huge one"
5,New Stroke 9 Album Rocks,If you enjoyed their Nasty Little Thoughts album..Then you'll love this one. The guys totally come through once again..With through unique sound and lyrics...Definitely a must have for any music fan...
5,"""Do it"" all over again","Stroke 9 has done it once more. We go from the days of hearing about the ""Little Black Backpack"" to now hearing about ""100 Girls."" Both songs very well written and performed. I waited for a long time for this CD to come out, and let me say that it was well worth the wait. This album is GREAT, and I have listened to it numerous times since I bought it. While all of the songs make you want to listen to the CD straight through some of my favorite songs are ""We were wrong,"" ""Just Can't Wait,"" and of course ""Do it Again."" I hope to catch up with these guys on tour because they're live show is just as good as their new CD."
3,Okay,"This CD is just fun. Yeah, the lyrics suck. They have a crappy rhyme scheme and are just overall bad in general. However, the music light and nice to listen to sometimes. I would recommend you pick this up if you have some extra money lying around, definitely don't save up for it."
5,made my cards look so professional,i bought these to do a thank you cards for sponsors of an event i am involved in. they come out so professional looking. i teamed up the cards with vellum and ribbon...WOW what a statement they made. every one was very impressed and thought we hired a printing company to do them.
4,Mixed Feelings.,"Great little programmable coffee maker with clock! I will keep it since I like it better then the other little 5 cup ones I have seen.However, there is no 'pause and serve' feature- make sure it is absolutely finished brewing before you get your coffee, or it will leak all over the warming plate and you will have to sop it up with paper towels. Also, sometimes if I pour too fast it leaks."
2,Over Priced and Over Priced,"Black & Decker was a bad choice for this style coffe maker. It's over priced, the glass pot is Ill cast and drips when you pour. A replacement pot costs more than the original price of the coffee maker."
2,Not that impressed,"Makes good coffee with the permanent filter if the proper amount of coarse grind coffee is used. It is noisy and slow. The outside of the coffeemaker gets very hot, nearly hot enough to burn.It sometimes will continue making gurgling and hissing noises while dripping coffee into the pot and hot water from around the top of the coffeemaker for 5 minutes or more after it should have finished brewing.It is necessary to raise the lid of the carafe when pouring or it will run down the side of the pot and onto the counter instead of into the cup.It is possible to buy 10-12 cup coffeemakers for less than what this one costs. I thought a smaller size would be a good idea as I only drink 4-6 cups a day. It's not a bad idea, but this particular coffeemaker has not proven to be worth the extra cost.I have considered boxing it up and shipping it to Black and Decker so they can see for themselves why I am not impressed with it."
5,Beautiful,"There are very few chrome finished floor registers on the market. This one is beautiful, it's tailored design will work with any decor."
4,Super cute!,The fabric is beautiful and the style was very nice. We returned it though as the matching rocker was of poor quality.
5,Great deal!,"Lightweight, comfortable, durable and looks great with any color scheme. Very happy with this product - and the quick delivery service!"
3,Informative....but overly LONG!,"I was so excited when I'd heard of this DVD set. I thought,""Finally a whole history of Yes with videos and interviews!""Well,....it is a whole DVD of interviews,BUT little music is here.At a running time of over 2 hours this was a chore to watch even for a big fan,and I am a fanatic for Yes. Yeah,there's loads of in depth information.But if they just kept putting a few minutes of performance in once in a while or even added a soundtrack of Yes music in the show's background then it might not get to feel so long winded.This is a one-off watching experience for me.I mean how many times can you view a long set of interviews? I haven't seen the performance extras yet. But I am so glad that I paid only $9.72 for this!I'd recommend this ONLY to the most AVID of Fans! I wished for more from this."
5,A Priceless work,"I purchased this book from a library close-out of old books for a mere 10-cents and having read it, I wouldn't sell it for ten-thousand pennies. It is truly my most favored piece. It's tattered pages have provided depth and riches to my prayer life as I'm sure it will to anyone who seeks a greater intimacy with our Creator and Father. Fosdick, in bringing the prayers of others into his pages, present a more comprehensive study to liberate our communication with our Lord. I can't love it enough for the way in which the Father is worshipped. A must read!"
4,Durable toy come with the turtle,My son wanted this toy for awhile. After reading the description I was not sure if the wheel came with a turtle figure or it was just the wheel. I didn't want my son to be disappointed that he was not getting what was in the picture. The wheel does come with the figure. The wheel is well made and stands up to outdoor play well.
5,"Great series, great collection","We've had the CDs in this boxed set for over a year now. The Classical Kids series has been wonderful. We have two boys (now 6 and 8) and this has been a great introduction to classical music. At first, the kids loved the stories which provide a sense of history and place and, ultimately, keep the kids interested in the entire CD. As they listened (time and time again), they started to pay more attention to the musical portions. Recently, we've been able to tell that they've picked up a sense of the music as we've listed to classical music on the car radio. Time and again, they perk up when listening to a piece of music and surprise us by saying ""That's Beethoven"". Sure enough - they've picked up something about the style of music that's characteristic of Beethoven. Sometimes it's the snippet of music from the CD and other times it's just the rhythms that are characteristic of that piece. As a family, we all recommend this."
5,It all started with Beethoven,"Many years ago I purchased my first CD in this series, ""Beethoven Lives Upstairs."" My children and I were delighted with it. I then discovered that there were more and searched them all out, one by one. My children, now 11, 9 & 5, have listened to these stories as they fall asleep for years. They each have a favorite composer and have gone on to learn more about them. These stories are a great introduction to some of our greatest composers. Not to mention a good intro to history, too!Imagine my delight that they are now in one boxed set! Now when asked, I suggest this set. What a great way to get it ALL! I truly believe that by surrounding our children with a variety of good music (including POP music) and information they will grow up with a greater appreciation for music and the arts."
5,Could Classical Music Education Get Any Better?,"We loved these collections years ago when our kids were much younger and we listened to the stories on cassette tapes in our very first mini-van on long trips to visit family. The scripts are attention-holding and the music is wonderful. Even today, I catch my kids whistling tunes from ""The Magic Flute"" or ""Meet Mr. Bach."" My wife, who teaches music in an elementary school, was tickled pink when she got the first collection for Christmas. What a great way to introduce a new generation to the great composers of all time! I highly recommend the CD set for families looking for truly wholesome and entertaining programming for their home or vehicle!"
2,Beware: This is for very young kids,"Many of the literature I saw about this set was that it was for all ages. I thought it was meant to teach your child in a dramatic way about the life of the composers. I was dead wrong. It was very lame! My kids hated it. They are teen, and preteen. Even I thought it was stupid. I would NOT recommend this except possibly for the very young. It does NOT teach about the composers, it is simply a modern (lame) story with the composers music in the background. They don't even talk about what songs they are or who composed them. I would steer away from this product!"
5,Strike Again!,"Behrens in wretched voice?I just can't understand these guys...I never heard a better recording by her before(I'm not an admirer Behrens' singing,if you read my others rewiews).I was stupefied by her ""Triff noch einmal!"",her fierce hate on scene VII,etc.Ludwig is amazing.I just can not put this in words.My biggest surprise;in despite of his respect to Strauss' mozartian idea to perform Elektra,I heard an energetic Ozawa here,so different of his Salome and Carmen.Besides,the best five maids ever(pay very attention on)and this amazing infallible BSO french horn section!Whow!Is this alive?What a lot of fine Elektras on cd's!"
1,Disappointing,"This recording is a complete disappointment. Behrens is here mostly in wretched voice. Secunde just doesn't sound right for the part of Chrysothemis, and Ludwig, alas, is well past her prime. Ozawa's interpretation is quirky to the extreme, and the music often sounds rather weird under his baton."
2,"The photo of the bracelet was accurate,.","The photo of the bracelet was accurate. I did return it, because I didn't like the way it fit my wrist, but that was my problem, not any problem with the actual bracelet."
5,superb,"Out of all his novels, including those set in India, this is his greatest work. Funny, wonderfully written, and sometimes disturbing, this novel is truly brilliant."
4,great to get follow up to Raj Quartet,"First I read the Raj Quartet which I really enjoyed but ended with you wondering what happened to the characters. This answered that question briefly but satisfactorily, glad I read it."
5,Good Reading,This book is a great follow-up to the 'Raj Quartet'. It follows an English family who remained in India after its independence and the changes they experienced.
3,Defective construction of book,"I didn't notice this until it was too late to return it to Amazon, but my new copy of this book was defective. A large section of the book appeared twice, and another section was not included at all. If you buy this book, I'd recommend checking your copy promptly to see if it has the same problem while there is still time to return it."
3,Classic case of U-Turn,"In an endnote she refers to book by Ursula King, and in that book King describes how Teilhard went to India and read Vedanta, and how he commented on Ramanuja's interpretation, and remarked that his own ideas were similar. Then he came up with the idea that the cosmos was the body of Christ, which is comparable to saguna brahman notion. But in her later works, Ursula King has ""protected"" Teilhard from eastern influences and likes to downplay that aspect, if she mentions it at all."
2,"Very comfy, but ugly.","You can't beat this shoe for comfort, but they're definately cuter in the picture. I thought they made my feet appear extra long and the heel didn't quite seem to fit the shoe. I returned them."
1,Inferior Master Tape??,"I purchased this CD with a hope that BGO did a great job in remastering as in the past with other albums. But it is not true. The sound of this CD is awful, like the tape was saturated, very unnatural sound. I compared a few same songs that appeared on EMI/Capitol release from awhile back ""The Very Best Of Jay & The Americans"", and EMI/Capitol sounded better. Perhaps, BGO did not use the original master tapes; a duplicate or third generation tapes? If I were you, please stay away from this release. It just a waste of money no matter how historical value it has."
4,"A beautifully dark, funny world","This collection of cartoons-which includes several of the original Addams family, in all its ghoulish glory-is perfect reading for the evening, or just before going to sleep. I'll never forget the one in which Gomez's predecessor (unnamed in the cartoons) gazes out the window at a violent storm and exclaims, ""Just the kind of day that makes you feel good to be alive!"""
5,Hilarious and Unique,"If you are a fan of black humor, then these cartoons are for you. This book contains many of his ""Addams Family"" cartoons, but there is MUCH more in there as well. A collection of classic cartoons that will have you rolling read after read!"
5,A Happy Marriage!,"The talented French pianist created a sort of world music as he wedded classical and jazz. Here as he traveled the USA in the 60's he arranged pop classics with a chamber orchesta of 4 or 5 French players. The result, great and unique blends and fine swinging melanges. Extremely clever and charming stuff. Grab it!"
5,Fall in Love with Brush-McCoy,"I began collecting McCoy pottery over one year ago, and have several books already. This book however, is absolutely wonderful if you're into collecting the wonderful older lines by Brush-McCoy.Great history given on the different lines. Super explanations throughout! Excellent pictures shown with many catalog reprints (the detail from these reprints is harder to see), but I have an older 1978 book as well, and these reprints are super! I don't even need the other book now!I, also, had several pieces that had remained unidentified thru other sources, but found in this book! Great reference, super learning tool, and a seperate value guide (although I find it hard to use, as it keeps falling out of the book). I find myself looking through it over and over again, as the pictures are super, detail is great, and I just might find that piece of unmarked pottery from having this book handy! Now to get Book 2!"
1,What a bunch of crap,"If anyone is trying to do any kind of research or learn about this job, don't read this book. I know rookie's that know more about this job. Anyone that refers do a (...) con crew as being a hotshot crew obviously knows little about this profession. She almost completely left out what a real Hotshot crew was, didn't talk about what a good engine crew was and as usual for someone that is on the way outside looking in, glorified Smokejumpers. Which is fine, they are great firefighters and a traditional part of our lifestyle, but they are rarely the ones who put the fires out that the public ever sees."
5,"Plush, Beautiful & Quick Delivery",The Manni Bear was an ideal gift for our office baby shower. It was well received by the receiver and the givers. The excellent quality of the bear was unobtainable in local retail stores. I was very pleased.
4,Good story CD to introduce young kids to Bach.,"The winner of several parents choice awards, this CD is the story of Bach, as told by Bach to a young girl (8) practicing her piano."
2,The dialogue is very disappointing,"My wife and I were very excited about this CD after enjoying Mozart's Magnificent Voyage and Beethoven Lives Upstairs. Unfortunately, the recurring theme of flippant dialogue played out by a chorus of insolent boys detracts from the overall story and listening experience. The story begins with a child complaining to her mother, which sets the tone for the underlying immature and disrespectful conversations throughout the rest of the story. The musical selections were wonderful, but the dialogue aims at captivating a child's petulant nature, as opposed to more edifying qualities that draw us to classical music in the first place. It is very disappointing!"
2,Big disappointment!,"I ordered this after hearing the smart and wonderfully creative ""Beethoven Lives Upstairs."" Sadly, this one is poorly written and badly acted. The setting for the story has Bach visiting modern-day children. This just doesn't work. Also, the producers have Bach speaking with a rather thick German accent. I found it very difficult to understand him at times. I'm sure children would struggle with this even more. Also, the tracks didn't seem to be mixed very well. Often the voices were uneven and difficult to discern."
3,Not as good as some of the other CDs in this series,"My husband and six year old were not very impressed by ""Mr. Bach Comes to Call"", but my two year old and I both liked it. I agree that it is not as good as ""Beethoven Lives Upstairs"", but it is worth listening to several times, and checking out from your library.This CD expresses very clearly the image of Johann Sebastian Bach coming from a large musical family, being a hard worker, and a prolific composer. It also highlights how so many things were different in the olden days; clothing, parenting, women's rights, large families etc. Did you know that Bach had twenty children, but only ten lived?As somebody who studied organ for three years in college, my big beef with this CD is that it left out Bach's ""Toccata and Fuge in D minor"", which was one of my favorite pieces to play. That seems like a major oversight, but perhaps they left it off because it could be too scary."
4,Arrived in 2 Business Days,"The stainless steel cups arrived in 2 days. They were exactly as expected in terms of quality. I gave it four stars because these aren't all-clad grade SS, but for $11 I didn't expect them to be. I didn't any of the problems with the shipper that the other reviewer had."
1,Never received,"I ordered this, and the company claimed they sent it to me, but I never received it. I had to contact Amazon to resolve the issue, and I finally got my refund. Amazon's customer service is EXCELLENT. This company, not so much."
2,Disappointment,"I guess I just expected more quality for the price. Two other Christmas videos that I'd bought from Amazon cost much less but had sharper images. I'm giving it away, as I'm not interested in playing it again."
3,Sing-Along DVD could be better...,"I was a bit disappointed with this DVD. Some parts of it are excellent -- the music and musicians are, for the most part, top-notch. However, some of the numbers have repetitive on-screen images, and there are a number of classic carol tunes featured for which verses are missing. A lot of the numbers also have an overly sentimental style that shortchanges the musical quality. I definitely fast forward through chunks of this DVD. Probably an octogenarian grandma or grandpa would enjoy this as background company."
2,Disappointed,"I was very excited about this item until we received it. The description doesn't really tell you what your getting. It's not ""fun"". It's very church choir like. Not good for christmas parites, which is what I wanted it for. Very disappointed,waste of money."
3,Not up to spped!,"If I had had the opportunity to have viewed a quick cross-section of the content, I would not have purchased this record. The quality of the music and visuals were very good, but the presentation was too fragmented. The interludes between verses were too long and distracting and eventually lost the singers attention. The variation of tempos did not impress me as a diversionary tactic.Sorry to day we turned off the video before it's completion."
3,Overall,"Fast shipping, nice packed came with a film protection against scratchess, its heavy so its real good metal quality. The only thing i saw as a problem its not protected against rain or hummidity. What i did is I bought a clear silicone paste does like tooth paste kind and I covered the entire circuit so it won't burn the system when it rains. Its a must for longlife use.Mine is working great in rain and the leads don't heat up so its safe for the silicone to cover the back of the circuit system.If it would had come with the circuit covered plate for rainI would have giving it a 5 Star rating.But it would not be business for them since it will last a long time.Hope my Feed back helps, I will try to upload a pic so you'll see how it looks."
3,Thought this was a frame for a Bike,"I bought this thinking it was for my bike but it turned out to be for car. For a car I'm sure it looks fine, just not the purpose I needed it for."
5,Cd is the tightest.,"Gots to give Bone & MO Thugs their props.They must've done some serious thinkin' (even they were just flowin like crazy).To Krayzie:Ain't said no names was the bomb.The album was put together very well.Keep thuggin on.Everybody needs to pick this up, even playahatas.Quick B,QT,(sameperson)out."
3,Not quite there,"They ain't nuthin wrong bout mo thugs but they ain't nuthin special bout dem.As much as i luv bone mo thugs is just a group of fam and friends they wanted to bring up wit dem.NOW GRAVEYARD SHIFT...DATS ANOTHER STORY.Tombstone and Sin got a style no one can match,to tell you tha truth i like dem so much i payed bout 14 dollars to here 1 song but tha rest of the cd aint bad."
4,"Finally, a tribute worthy of K.K. Cutter!","This tribute to the great Northwest architect Kirtland Kelsey Cutter brings his time and architecture to life. Although his name is well known, the vastness of his work is not. I think you'll be suprised, as I was at just how much Cutter contributed, not only to Spokane, but around the country and the world!"
5,black swarm,"this is great it has gore,creature violence,explosions.and a kinda good ending so nomore bad endings."
3,Beautiful but superficial,"This is a lovely book, with many wonderful plates of celtic art. However, if you want an in-depth look at the celtic art style and its evolution and meaning, this book is somewhat superficial.The limited text has a somewhat New Age approach to it, and it does help if you know at least a bit of celtic mythology and folklore already. If you are looking for a richly illustrated book of celtic art, this is the book for you."
2,stupes,"Tape did not sick to glass after making sure glass was clean, thank God it is plastic because it fell off on route to work I ended up putting double sides tape over the original tape for it to sick"
5,A police like style to discussing the mob,"This book is written in a tex-book style which is so perfectly crafted with police like detail to thehistory of mob events. The only mis-representation for the book is the cover which almost led me to believe that this would have been written with a yellow journalism tinge to it, rather the book is crafted most perfectly and reads with absolute flow."
2,Poor Copy,I was not happy with the sound. Most of the songs had a poor bass quality. It was simply a poor copy.
3,"Snappy title, sappy writing","Oh the overdone language in this one! Personally, the word ""verily"" is one of my favorites. I love the old language, but when it's overdone, it makes me ill. This is a sickeningly sweet, chest beating, pathetic excuse for a historical novel. Ms. Dunn definately overdid the language, as other people have said here. I tried and tried to get into the story, but I just couldn't. I think I stopped on page 27. I just couldn't go on. I am a lover of quality historical fiction, and know it's hard to come by. If you are looking for quality fiction of this nature, check out Alison Weir's newest. This author couldn't compete with Alison for even a moment. The title lured me in, but beyond the pretty picture on the cover and the snappy title, there is nothing this book could offer except nausea."
5,Great Read,As an avid reader of Tudor History I found this book to be a great read. It took me back in time and kept me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't wait to turn the page. I will be recommending this book to all my book clubs and my friends as well.
5,Understanding the Aussies,"Australians have some unique ways of expressing themselves, so sometimes an American gets totally lost. For instance, ""fanny"" is a different part of the anatomy in Australia.They use a lot of shortened words so you get a sentence like, ""Did the postie bring you a lot of pressies from your rellies for chrissie?"" A list of these diminuatives is included in the book, so you could translate that sentence into, ""Did the postman bring you a lot of presents from your relatives for Christmas?""Some expressions parallel American slang (white elephant, village idiot), possibly because of the British background. Others need defining (spat the dummy, do a Melba, bullswool). This book clarifies all that in 512 pages. I found it a great resource when I lived in Australia for three years."
4,"Great overview, somewhat lacking on details","I purchased this book for a fairly major wiring project. I read it cover to cover, and it gave me a pretty good understanding of how every part of a home electrical system works. It included lots of helpful tips about code requirements and some places where you might want to think about exceeding the code.I felt that the book could have used a greater variety of circuit diagrams for common household projects. I found a good collection of these in theBlack & Decker Complete Guide to Wiring. I would still recommend this book for anyone interested in a general understanding of home wiring."
5,Best electrical book I found,"We built our first house, and I wanted to do a lot of the work myself. To do the wiring, I first read every book I could find. This was one of the two I ended up purchasing for myself for reference because it had everything I needed. (The other was a code book.)This is now one of my favorite authors. Not only does he know his technical details, he is excellent at explaining them as well. Very, very good.I'm not sure how good this book would be for someone who doesn't understand the basics of electricity. I already had a good background in that, so I'm not a good judge there.We've lived in our house since 2001 with no electrical problems as of this writing, so this is definitely a good book."
1,Recalled but not replaced,"I received a notification from Amazon that this book had been recalled because of an error in it that could lead to a serious electrical problem, and that I needed to contact the publisher directly to order a replacement or refund. But the phone number for the publisher was ALWAYS busy on the MANY times I tried to call. It was as though they just took the phone off the hook and walked away. And there was no other recourse by mail or email. Very annoying. And what's worse, nobody will indicate where the error in the book is. Don't buy this. I'm also going to avoid other publications in the For Pros by Pros Series."
4,good reference,"This book has great pictures and easy to follow descriptions that make wiring as simple as possible for a novice like me. We redid our entire electrical system with help from this book, and my only real critique is that the book could use a section on drawing up plans. There are many different symbols that one must be familiar with in order to draw up the appropriate plans to submit for permit to do any major electrical work, and this book is silent on the topic. However, for actually doing the work, this book was indispensable!"
4,Great Deal,"With so many books out there what made me get this one was not only how easy to follow and understandable the author made it but more importantly because it comes in FULL COLOR, I don't know why books don't come in color anymore but being a novice in electricity I expect a few things to be color coded, so why on earth I would buy a Black & White book?. Congratulations to Rex Cauldwell, the author, this is a great one and I would recommend it 100%.P.s: The price is a BIG PLUS!"
3,wasn't so good. need to have references to the electrical code art.,"Good price.The book is most valuable to me because of its advice about fishing and working around carpentry. It has a little bit of coverage about other advanced topics, like using water proof fittings, choosing wire connectors, and using some conduits. While it has a whole chapter on doing service and meter wiring, it doesn't go into any detail about the other subjects, and that suggests to me that the author was a littel confused about the priorities of his audience. There's not enough information here to safely wire an air conditioner, a jacuzzi, or a spa; but the information on installing a service panel is very complete"
4,Yes for the Pro's.,"Not that this isn't any DIY're shouldn't have around. This book shows you all the ins and outs of complete wiring of a house.If you are a DIY'er you'll need all the books on house constrution, so that when you bust that first hole through the wall you'll know whats waiting for you and how to put it back together again the way you want it to be."
4,Well illustrated and good advice,"Contains much valuable common sense advice that you won't get in the National Electrical Code books. Good illustrations. I wouldn't have organized it quite the same way, but that may be just fine for most readers. I have not finished it yet nor finished all my re-wiring project, but expect it will be a great help."
4,Great book to add to you Home Improvement Library,It is a great book for the do-it-yourselfers. Plus it is designed by the pros in the electrical field.
5,Great Resource,"I am a female who is planning to be the general contractor for a new 8,000 square foot home. With no previous experience, I am learning everything I can so that I am able to choose contractors who are qualified and so that I will have the knowledge to ensure the work is done properly. I loved this book as it has tons of useful information. Although some complained it is not a beginner book, I had very little background and am able to understand most of the book without a problem. It is well written and clear. Although I will not be doing any wiring myself, I can now confidently specify materials and the way I want things done. I can also distinguish between electrical contractors who try to get away with the minimum and those who pride themselves on a high quality job. I have been reading dozens of books on every trade, and this is one of my favorites. If you will be building a house and want to be involved, this is a must have."
4,Good supplement to a code book,"Lots of good reviews here already. I would add that this shouldn't bethe only book you get. It's got lots of really good tips that youdon't find other places, but it is by no means a substitute for agood NEC code book or textbook like Ray Mullin's.It's also an intermediate book and assume that you know something.If you grab Fine Homebuilding every month, you're the ideal reader."
2,lack of info,Not a bad book but totally lacking in tables and calculations for completing the projects described in the book. The better choice would have been the book by the N.E.C. This book didn't even have ampere ratings for the different size conductors. I would only recommend this book to beginners.
2,not recommended for beginners,"I know I'm going against the grain here, but I didn't like this book at all. It may be a fine reference for more experienced folks, but as a complete novice with no experience at all, I found it left much to be desired. Some parts of the book were better than others, but I was really quite lost with many of the descriptions of various tasks. There were a lot of passages which were incomprehensible. Features and objects were not described clearly in many cases, and terminology was used and not defined clearly. For the beginner, Black and Decker's ""The Complete Guide to Home Wiring"" is far better. In that book, color photos illustrate every single step. That's the kind of guidance a beginner needs."
4,Very Pleasantly Surprised,"I am an older kid (36) and purchased this mostly because it has the songs - ""what makes you different"" and ""Get a clue"" - having heard the first on Princess Diaries and the 2nd off the Disney movie titled Get a Clue. But, I was very pleasantly surprised that I actually like this CD a lot!! My friends like it too. We call it HAPPY MUSIC. Very upbeat and puts you in a peppy mood. I do not, however, care for the Aaron Carter song. The lyrics are cute - but I think he probably has much more to offer."
1,HORRIBLE,A pretty good show ruined by large elevated shadows in the background of the 2 main players which the camera moves to more than occasionally. To see what I mean look at the cover art for Sonny Rollins Saxophone Collossus CD. There is another shadow for Art Farmer playing trumpet as well. Sometimes the camera drops back and shows both the players and the shadows. You just can't concentrate on the music.
5,The Fix is a great social commentary on our political processes.,"A story about a political family that will make you wonder about our good ole boy and men's club agendas. Will bring up lots of memories about the last two elections we suffered through. Great songs like One, Two, Three, Simple Words and Childsplay evocative of people who are not well suited for the task of government and yet pushed and molded to trick the eye. Powerful and scary. One of the reasons it was not a popular musical was that it hit too close to home. John Barrowman gives his usual all out, over the top performance. Phillip Quast and Kathryn Evans as the conniving mother and uncle are great. Krysten Cummings does a beautiful job singing the role of Tina. The score is quite strong."
3,"Love it, but hate it too","The Fix is a pretty above-average musical of late, with its catchy/varied songs and its all-too accurate themes of politics. However, the entire thing is depressingly cynical, unbelievably cynical, and even though the tragedies of Cal and his manipulating Uncle grip you, there is no alternative offered, and no redemption for any of the characters in the play. I listened to it a bunch at first, and eventually had to shelf it- too many problems revealed, not a single one reconciled."
1,A waste of money,"I found this book to be completely useless. I went through the entire quantitative section and found that the questions given in the study guide were about a hundred times easier than the questions on the actual test. Many concepts weren't gone over, the verbal section is outdated, and the CD practice tests are incredibly easy compared to the real thing. The explanations on the verbal section of the CD were about the only useful thing about this package but they are torturous to go over. Don't waste your money on this. I'm already shopping for another study guide."
2,Not a complete review for 2006 test!,"While the verbal was OK, I felt that the quantitative was far from complete. I recently took the test and had some questions that were not reviewed in the book. For example this book did NOT cover negative exponents and the 1-2-sqrt3 ratio of a 30-60-90 triangle, both a which came about for a total of 6 questions on the test!! Granted these are simple concepts, but they were absolutly not covered in this book and hence this was not a complete review.The practice sections were clumsy in presentation. This book is dated and is NOT suitable for a complete 2006 GRE."
3,"Decent, but need more materials.","It's good that it gives you six practice tests, so that you can become more familiar with the material. The quantitative comparison section (and the math section in general) is something that you can coach pretty quickly just with repetition. However, I must warn you, there are a couple of typos, and it can be very frustrating.The verbal section I found is decent. The reading comprehension material is good, as the explanations section is pretty detailed and reasonable. The vocabulary tested on in the book is varies greatly, sometimes it is insultingly easy, sometimes it comes out of nowhere, and unfortunately, the explanations for this section is not as clear or as comprehensive as I would like. You definitely need to get a dictionary or otherwise find supplemental material.I didn't use the software at all. It isn't appealing, and causes problems with my computer for some reason. I might try again, but I gave up on using it."
3,Average software,"CAUTION!: This book/CD has EXCACTLY the same CD/software like the ""Gre General Cbt Testbuster (Testbuster)"". I bought both of them and I wasted my money since I care only for the CD/software. I contains three CATS which is good but it is not even in my top 5 recommendations for the GRE."
1,Disappointing failure,"Not only is this book full of material that is NOT on the GRE, the disk is not compatible with current versions of Windows, and the accompanying website that should allow one to update the software is of no use whatsoever. Some REA books have been well done but not this one. It is particularly disappointing that the publisher has not gotten a better author and re-written this drivel. GRE students face a dearth of good material, and this book does nothing to remedy the problem."
2,Outdated Software & non-existent tech support,"I bought this book in preparation for the GRE. I bought it online, so I based my decision on the claims made by Research & Education Association. They claim to be ""The Very Best Coaching & Studying Course"". The other reason why I chose this book was because it offered 6 Full-Length Practice Exams. I got the book and I wasn't too impressed with the set up or the explanations, but I thought it would be redeemed with the tests. I tried for hours to get the CD to load correctly. It was written for ancient machines and the patches provided for Windows Vistas do NOT work. I have tried for 2 weeks to get someone in their tech dept. to help me resolve the issues, but I have not heard back. I also wrote to the main office to express my disenchantment, and they also didn't respond. It is the worse $40.00 (I didn't buy it on Amazon) I have spent on a book!!! The only reason why I give it two stars is because it does a respectable job with some written exercises."
5,An excellent overview other coverages barely touch,"There have been other histories of Wall Street before: so what makes What Goes Up: The Uncensored History Of Modern Wall Street As Told By The Bankers, Brokers, CEOs And Scoundrels Who Made It Happen so special from the others? The title says it all: this is not just a third-party analysis of history but a set of insider's observations by those who made Wall Street the center of the financial world. Financial journalist Weiner provides insights based on not just a few, but hundreds of interviews with all levels of Wall Street insider from Warren Buffett to Alan Greenspan: the result is an excellent overview other coverages barely touch."
5,Best New Band 2005,"WOW! Great new sound with kick ass riffs and vocals.Dale Steele pulls it off! Then again with David Ellefson, John Davis, Steve Conley, and Dave Small how could he not.They can be heard going through the website http://www.f5fanclub.com<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.F5TheBand.com/?friend=2260""></a>"
5,Great CD. Must Buy !!!!!,"After making my way through this album I couldn't wait to play it again. Well writen and well produced ""Drug For All Season"" is a excellent collaberation between some talented musicians. I have a good vibe about F5."
1,Worse than a train wreck.,At least with this I could stop watching. This is worse than awful. I should have checked the reviews here before spending a whole dollar to rent. Acting is really bad. Plot even worse. Avoid this movie. No stars is what I would like to give it.
2,River of Darkness... it's true... it's true!,"Will Logan (Kurt Angle) a sheriff protecting his town from the resurrected Jacobs brothers (Kevin Nash, Psycho Sid), siblings who were lynched long ago and are back to seek revenge from beyond the grave.I wanted this to be great, sadly it wasn't. Worth watching if you are a die hard wrestling fan like just to check out Nash, Angle and Sid in a movie... otherwise avoid."
1,So hilariously bad!,"I read the reviews here on amazon and for a couple bucks I figured I check it out. The movie is so hilariously bad that I could not stop laughing. From the horrible acting, to production, story, everything! This is supposed to be a horror film but it's just so bad. Put this on at a party for a ""bad movie night"" then this movie should be put at the top of the list. As a bonus it has a theatrical trailer, the trailer actually makes the movie look good with good production, the trailer is a million times better than the movie. Period."
3,cheesy movie but still fun to watch,"ok, so it's kinda cheesy lol, but it's still fun to watch with your friends and have a laugh with it! It's too bad that cheap filming was used to save money. To be fair, I think that Kurt Angle would be an ok actor if he was given the chance to play in a real high budget movie. However, it's still fun to watch when you're bored on a weeknight :)"
1,Not Even A Half Star,"This is the WORST movie I've ever seen. The acting done in the wrestling ring is better than the acting in this movie. Kevin Nash and Sid Vicious say about 6 words total between the two of them. Kurt Angle should have been so lucky. Everyone and anyone associated with this movie should be ashamed of themselves. The bad part about it all is that the story line is actually pretty good. If better actors with talent would have done this movie, it would have been better, with a few minor changes to the story. Also, no special effects, and a lame 70's late night movie look to the whole movie...almost soap operish. Even if you are a huge Kurt Angle fan, or wrestling fan (and I am) I cannot recommend this movie to anyone and not feel guilty about it. Terrible at best. Should have watched it before I bought it."
1,a one legged dog would have done a better acting job!,"after 15 minutes i could take no more the acting is awful and the plot is incredibly lame, i hope these guys are better at wrestling than they are as actors, i paid a buck at redbox and im pissed i lost a dollar!"
2,Box Art>Movie,"Check out the box art. Pretty cool right? Looks like an action movie with some wrestlers and guns. Nope. What you'll see is some dv camera filmed low budget serious mystery/horror movie with un-hammy bad acting. You'd think Angle is the problem; nope, he's fine compared to the other bit characters. The moral of the story is that just because you have a script and a camera doesn't mean you should put it on film without thinking about it first. If this was shot with 35mm and the actors hammed it up in the 80's horror/comedy style, it would work and be enjoyable; in digital with ""serious"" acting, it does not."
2,"A low-budget ""Scy Fy"" channel original-esque movie, with worse acting. Movie OK, acting really, really bad. I say D+","How do you stop ghosts from killing? After a series a gruesome murders strikes a small river town Sheriff Logan (Angle) notices a similarity. After his investigation points to three brothers that are dead things start to get weird. For starters the main stars of the movie are three wrestlers : Kurt Angle, Kevin Nash and Psycho Sid Vicious. When these are you main stars you really can't expect alot from the movie. The plot, acting and apparent budget reminded me of a ""Scy Fy"" channel original movie...only worse. The acting is really, really bad. The movie itself could have been worse I guess, but the acting was so bad it's distracting. Overall this was better then I expected, but the acting was SO BAD it's hard to overlook. Movie is a C-, acting is F. When taking both into account, I say D+.Would I watch again? - No way"
1,Let's Rumble!,"We need some objectivity in our reviews so here goes: First, the wrestlemania people are reaching out and grabbing even more of us. Help! Second, the (and friends) cast's acting experience is largely made for TV or wrestle movies or practically no acting experience or D grade (no, that's not a B) level cheap horror/action flicks for the educated audience. Third, about the only place you can find this flick is as a $1 rental because - well, I wonder why. Fourth, as to the other attributes of a movie - let's just move on for that one."
3,"It gets the job done, but...","The incompatibility with recent operating systems can be infuriating. The developer offers driver updates on their website, but they're still over two years old and don't always fix the problem. Sometimes even reinstalling the drivers won't fix issues. It would be a fantastic product if it worked correctly all of the time, but if you're unfamiliar with troubleshooting these kind of things you might be better off getting a full blown PC gamepad."
3,"Works, but could do better.","I bought an adapter hoping to play pc games with my wavebird gc controller. Unfortunately, this adapter does not support the wavebird, so I used my wired controller. It works well enough when used with X-Padder to work in my games, but I've yet to test either the PS2 or the XBox segments. One major issue I have with it is that it greatly lowers the sensitivity of the joysticks (especially the c stick), which prevents me from playing 3D games (where you move the camera with the second joystick) at the efficiency I would have liked. Also, if you go to the controller's configuration in control panel, the software packaged with the driver causes a blue screen; I assume this is some lack of foresight on the company's part, and that this would have been where further configuration would have been possible. I am running Windows 7 64 bit and using the most updated driver from the company's website the adapter works fine."
3,Great read,I ordered this as a gift for a retirement party. I understand from them this book helped them to think outside the box. Gave them much more insight into what life could be like after retirement. Worth your time to read.
1,Very BAD,"I received it with the broken screen, I formulated the reclamation and he was not originating."
4,"The book centers on the technical, but be patient.","Yes, there is a technical focus in this book. But it is quite plainly written, and more importantly it lays very solid groundwork to discuss oil alternatives.The oil alternatives discussion was the most useful part of the book for me. The author does talk about a lot of other alternatives, and comes to some conclusion on how much they can contribute and by when. I imagine there are better books out there on any given alternative, but it was a good survey.It should be emphasized that he only talks about energy that comes from the ground, so to speak. He does not consider solar, wind power, etc. because he does not have the technical background.I would read this book in place of his previous one. It is more balanced between the history of oil production and its eventual peak, and what the future holds for us at that peak."
5,Enjoyable and informative,"This is a great book. Prof. Deffeyes obviously knows his stuff. He displays an incredible depth and breadth of knowledge about all forms of energy production and a whole lot more. Given the amount of information in the book, it's nothing short of amazing how much fun it is to read. His plain-spoken style and humorous comments make it a pleasure from beginning to end."
2,Too dry to read,The book talks about potential alternative energy sources without any mentioning on the economic implication. I found it very dry to chew.
5,Finally Some Decent Info About Oil Shale And Tar Sands,"In this follow up to his previous book on Hubbert's Peak/Peak Oil, Deffeyes gives us some engrossing info on such subjects as the Alberta tar sands, the Green River oil shale and nuclear power. Out of all the peak oil books I've read so far, this one is the only one that gives a very concise and knowledgable summary on these and other ""alternatives"" to cheap oil. Most other peak oil writers aren't old school geologists with hydrocarbon strings pumping in their veins instead of blood, so you don't get the feeling they really know what they are talking about. Several books I've read casually dismiss the Alberta tar sands and the Green River oil shale and shouldn't. Deffeyes doesn't. I'm actually a bit more hopeful and optimistic about the world's energy future after reading this book. (Not by much, though.)"
5,An introduction to sociolinguistics,"The item is very good. I even did not think that it would be that new. I bought it as used but to tell you the truth, I can say it is new because it is really new."
1,Beware - its older than you might think,"I purchased this book based on the data given, especially also the publishing date, listed as February 2008. NOT TRUE. This book is a REPRINT of a 1912 ""original"" and as such completely worthless as a guide to modern cultivation. I feel tricked, but I'm stuck. I live in Ecuador and so the book is impractical to return (never mind what it cost to get here in the first place). I suspect, in 1912 this book would have been exactly what I needed... a century too late... I wonder, could I have given it a ""no stars"" rating?"
5,Robust and inspirational,"This was far from a ""failed"" research project, as one reviewer implied. McClelland successfully managed to predict the economic futures of entire countries (e.g., Japan, India), as well as intervening in them to some extent, as he did in India. There is a reason why this book was required reading at the Harvard Business School for so long.The research methodology is ingenious and difficult to make simple, but the patterns of motivated behaviors have shown themselves quite robust, and still underpin a great deal of the work on competencies, e.g., the work of Goleman and Boyatzis. Is it current? No. Does it have something to teach us about the Achievement Motive and how it influences culture and society? No question."
3,fascinating document from a failed research program,"This book documents a research program of McClelland and associates in the late 1950s and 1960s to isolate and document the ""achievement motive"" ascribed to individuals (or groups) as an explanation of ""the rise and fall of civilizations,"" largely unmediated by the influence of institutions or other social or historical forces. Although it is fair to say that little if any of this perspective would be accepted by contemporary social scientists, the book is fascinating in retrospect as it documents McClelland and Co.'s attempts to quantify the ""achievement motive"" for example by scoring the content of folk tales, elementary school reading primers, and popular music, and then the linkage of these measures to other social outcomes, complete with ex post rationalizations of the results (or lack of results) obtained in these exercises."
4,Long Island represents strong on this 1!!!,Murray....De La...DJ Ev...and that new kid S-ON is tight!!!! looking 2 hear more from that kid!!!
5,his best album,"to me this is his best album he stepped his game up on the production,its more dark now,nothing against the 1st one but this album has better production than the 1st one that's what really makes this album special,this is that real hip hop that you can blast in your car,he's underrated and shouldn't be,i hope he gets the attention he deserves,and what makes this album really special is that its an east coast hip hop compilation.recommeded for fans of real hip hop and underground hip hop,standout tracks are Trouble In The Water with de la soul,5 Seconds with black attack (he's nice), Team Players with krs-one and doe i think its jon doe not sure, Blaze It Up with black attack (my favorite track on the album),Go Crazy with S-On my 2nd favorite,and finally my 3rd favorite Around The Clock with problemz (that beat is hot,it has like a japanese mythical feel to it),recommended."
4,Great album,"Awesome album, great to just relax too- has a ton of great appreances on it, it really would be impossible for this album to be anything less than 4 stars.... Black Attack, Mos Def, De La... its really dope and if you dont own it your missing out-Peace"
1,Anti-Semitic rubbish,"This novel is absolutely abominable. The storyline and plot are crap, with no real excitement/twists and turns. The characters make ridiculous comments to each other e.g. ""I think there is going to be a civil war in Israel"". Anti-Semitic views and ideas are supported throughout the novel, which I'm sure will cause great offence to Jewish readers. As a Christian, I feel ashamed that a fellow Christian would write such bigoted drivel.This book is a real bore; the plot can be summed up in a pamphlet."
5,Moving,I found this book deeply moving on many levels. I understand that we Jews have committed many human rights violations in Israel against the Palestinians. I sometimes wonder how we can do such a thing having gone through the holocaust ourselves. This book convicted my heart and I want to thank the author from the bottom of my heart.
2,Steam can not reach 3rd tier.,"I tried this steamer to steam with 3 tiers, steam can not reach 3rd tier, and when 2nd tier cooked well, 1st tier was over steamed. Design is bad too. Steam comes out from exterior water inlets on both sides of base and make the above handles moist and hot. Rice bowl was made from black plastic, bad quality."
1,Electrics fail,"Worked great for a couple of months, but then the display stopped working, the buttons wouldn't do anything, effectively making the steamer useless."
1,Broken POS,"The steamer worked great for about 2 months after we bought it. Then the display got messed up, and the buttons don't depress properly. I would suggest going for another brand, this was just unacceptable build quality."
1,BISPHENOL A,"Deni 7600 3-Tier 9-1/2-Quart Stainless-Steel Digital Food Steamer4/22/12Before considering any FOOD STEAMER I want to have a certification from a independent testing laboratory in the United States that certifies.""There is no lead in the stainless steel.There is no Biphenyl A (BPA) in the plastic parts"".Robert Flynn Orange County CA"
1,Poor Product,"I purchased this steamer as a Christmas gift for my wife in 2006. Within a few weeks it started to leak and then the digital clock failed. We returned it to the company for replacement. They sent a new one, and the clock on that one also failed, so we retuned it in Oct. of '07. They finally sent us another new one in Feb. of '08. Within a few days, the digital clock on this unit failed. I can accept that one unit can have a defect, and it's not out of the question that a second one could, by coincidence, also have the same defect, but three units with the exact same defect??? I don't think so. This is a good looking product that is inferior in quality. Stay away from it!"
1,Disappointed,"I used this to steam fiber for spinning. At first it was great, after about 3 runs, the steam leaked into the readout and I had no idea how long it was supposed to be going. It got so bad that the unit stopped working because it was so wet. Waited for it to dry, worked again, until it got damp again. Leaks badly in my studio. Im really disappointed because it's one of the few that has 3 tiers of space. I am going to try to find another one but in the meantime, my stovetop is in use."
1,Unacceptable reliability!,It looks very nice and that is the reason I got it. If you are going to use it daily it is going to quit working after about 30 or so days. I had 2 of these doing the same thing!
1,Will Return This,"I have owned an Oster 5712 2-tier steamer and use it so much, I wanted to purchase a unit for my mother-in-law for Christmas.But the local shops were all out of them - we searched everywhere. So we decided to gift the Deni steamer, instead. Although I got it to turn on (after much fiddling!) and steam some raisins that needed plumping for a fruit salad, my MIL was never able to get it to work again, and she tried several times.The design is flawed. The trays are thin/flimsy and difficult to position on the unit. We had to try all of them before finding the tray that seated into the base. All in all, this was a terrible disappointment because now we have to return it and find another Oster somewhere. It was a brand new unit, never opened, so I suspect that Quality Control is a bit lax."
1,Defective out of the box,"I followed the instructions to set the clock and turn it on. The clock set, but would not turn on. I was a little leery of getting this steamer, after reading other comments about the controlls not working, should have heeded their advice."
2,Great Steamer While It Lasts - Very Poor Reliability,"My husband and I received this steamer as a wedding gift in February '09. I had wanted one for quite a while and was very excited to try it out. We've used it at least once a day since opening it.The Good: It does a great job of steaming whether you use one, two or all three tiers.The Bad: It stopped working today (June '09). Went through the trouble shooting tips that we could find online and were unable to get it working.Conclusion: I am very glad that we received this steamer as a gift instead of spending our money on it. It worked great from February 09 through June 09. We will be replacing this steamer with one from another brand once we have a chance to do some research on it."
1,Garbage,"the steamer doesnt shut off automatically, so the base will get dry and the plastic covered heating element will melt. The bowl for steaming rice etc is so small it is a joke. Honestly i dont know why this product is on the market but i does tell to avoid Deni products."
3,Buttons Are Flimsy,"The Deni does a great job steaming vegetables(that's all I've done at this point) and I don't have any complaints as far as that goes. However, I'm a little concerned with the programmable and on/off buttons of the Deni. They are flimsy and I halfway expect them to just fall out one of these days soon. I had wondered if the seller had sold me a previously used reconditioned one or if this problem happens to be common to this product. I don't know, but I guess for the price I paid, I shouldn't be worried about the buttons falling out."
5,Simply loved the product.,Used it to make dumplings ( meat inside wrapped with wonton wrap)came out awesome. The meat was nicely cooked and even the wonton wrap.The steam disburment was just perfect. Overall A+ product.
5,RAGTIME REVIEW/REVUE,This item is a time piece item. In the style of old piano/jazz! For me personally it takes me back the old pizza parlors i use to go to with the nickelodeons and player pianos.Great music for everyone of any age!!
5,Highly recommended reading.,"In New England there is so much history. There are also little no communities' rich in story and this is about some of those towns. The book is set in the small rural areas of New Hampshire called Atkinson, Derry and Hampstead.Legends of the pond is a collection of stories, poems, letters and so much more about Big Island Pond. The book is well written and I was very impressed with the author ability to make the words come to life.Covering the time frame from 1692 to the present you'll read stories about rum-running, underground railroads and even John Glenn, who spent 11 years summering on the island. There is bound to be something everyone can enjoy with this book.One thing I liked about this book is that you do not have to read it in any order, skip around the pages and let history take you on a journey, what you'll find in the pages is pure magic. The author has done a great job and I highly recommend reading this one."
4,Ozark Mountain Daredevils - some really great music!,"Without a doubt this group did not receive the accolades they deserved. Besides the more popular songs noted by other reviewers that helped to set this band apart from others, most notably ""Spaceship Orion"" in my opinion, their song ""Within Without"" is equally superb. I haven't yet found a complete compilation that includes all of their best music, but I continue to hope that it is forthcoming. Until that happens, these two musical offerings serve as an excellent appetizer!"
2,Not pleased,"I purchased this iron to replace a 7-year old Panasonic. I am returning this Sunbeam Steam Master because I would rather use my decrepit Panasonic! The one good thing I can write about the Sunbeam, is that the steam blast feature was nice. However, the plate did not get very hot and the retractable cord was laughable. I had to literally coax it back into place by repeatedly pulling the cord and readjusting it to the point I had to almost stuff it back into its hidey-hole. This is a disappointing product."
4,"Leaks, but over all ok for the price.","I liked the iron, worked well, but as others have noted, it leaks alot. I have found with some other brands that the steam just doesn't work at all. At least this one had a decent shot of steam."
1,"Sunbeam Steam Master, poor product","This iron is fragile, poorly constructed and breaks easily. Furthermore, the iron leaks water and stain clothing. This happens while using the iron under normal conditions and following the manufacturer's instructions."
2,Another Leaker,I experienced the same problem many others did - the iron leaked water all over. It seemed to be coming from the side of the sole plate. Returned it for a better model.
4,just what i expected,This itemwas just what I expected. I got it at a good price and would reccomend buying it to any of my friends.
3,First effort on MCA,"With relatively no success behind her, Reba decided to leave Mercury Nashville in search of a new label. It was this kind of gutsy decisions that would eventually propel her to the top of the industry. MCA ended up in a bidding war with another label over an artist they could only judge by potential. This first effort definately shows great improvement over her previous work at Mercury, yet she is still not at the top of her form. The best album she had released to date, the album is chalked full of great songs, even though Reba still doesn't seem to be in control of her own style and sound. The stand-out tracks are ""Tell Me What's So Good About Goodbye,"" ""Every Second Someone Breaks a Heart,"" ""I""m Gettin' Over You,"" and the heart-wrenching ""If Only."""
3,Reba - Just a Little Love,I am a huge Reba fan but unfortunately I was not overly impressed with this cd. There were a few good songs but most were just mediocre.
5,IF REBA WENT POP THEN THIS IS THE BEST OF IT!!,"If Reba was going to go the pop route, this is a good example of it!! The songs are just the right blend of traditional country with contemporary production and her voice is great! Having good material always helps. This is one of her best! Enjoy!"
4,1st Bratz,"my daughter is 7 and has been asking for Bratz for the last couple of years. My husband and I had agreed that in the past the Bratz were not dolls we felt appropriate for our daughter. However, the new Kidz line seem to be more suitable so we broke down and bought a few for Christmas. They have more clothes and less makeup; yeah. My daughter loves her Cloe and with the added accessories we felt it was a good value for the money. From here, we are a little more comfortable purchasing the Babyz and Kidz..."
4,doll,My 8-9 year old loves to play with Bratz dolls. I much prefer the kidz - not trashy like the 'grown up' ones!
5,Azar is the best of what's available.,"Azar (as the author and text are called) is very good at explaining fundamentals of English grammar, and it is very thourough in the amount of examples and exercises it provides: fill-in-the-blank and oral exercises fill the book. The one complaint I have with this text as an ESL application is its lack of thematic units, which are very important to comprehension of subject matter. Being able to apply skills in a one-theme context keeps learning easier and less confusing. Use this text until something better comes this way (such as the forthcoming text by Karen Russikoff et al)."
3,Almost wonderful,"I loved this book for the first 150 pages or so, liked it for the next 150--and then stopped. Carter has loads of talent but could have used a stronger editor, as others have noted. the story just went on too long on the same note. Particularly wearing was the narrator's tortured relationship with his wife--divorce her, for cripe's sake. But I'll look forward to his next."
4,Unusual peephole into ignored segment of black society,"As a student of sociology, I found The Emperor of Ocean Park to be a true gem. The inner voice of a black man raised with discipline and demands to excel made upon him by his parents in an upper middle class milieu. To see the world through these eyes was a wonderful experience. The media so often pretends that this segment of American society simply does not exist. It is time that it is given a voice. That is in an entertaining mystery makes it all the better. No ponderous tract this, although I agree it could have been substantially shorter. Even when the hero succumbs to racial paranoia, his brain manages to think its way out of it. Should be read by many of those who can only see blacks in one dimension-poor and inarticulate."
5,An Excellent Read,"Riveting story layering mystery on mystery. Greatly developed characters: believeable, multi-faceted. Second favorite book that I've read in the last decade."
3,Not bad,Overall the book wasn`t bad. It was a bit drawn out without good reason I thought which frustrated me a little. Also I thought the ending was a little anti-climactic.
3,S L O W start,"The first 225 pages or so barely kept me interested. However, it picks up pretty well and has really kept my attention."
2,One way to go through this far too long novel,"There is so much repetition in this book, so much dissertation on subjects that might appeal to specialists (e.g.chess, law,)but are of little interest to the ""general reader"" that the only way to finish it is to skip as many pages as you can.There are too many characters and none of them are likeable, starting with Talcott Garland. True, not all protagonists need to be brilliant or interesting but this one is a wimp and doesn't know where he is heading. Which is the same with the author."
3,The Emperor of ocean park,I just finished the book. I found the story to be interesting but felt it was a bit long.
2,I just couldn't read another page,"Although there does seem to be some interesting plots being developed, they just seemed to be taking way too much time in being exposed to the reader. Such things as a character being about to say what happened to the judge's nomination being interrupted by a ringing telephone, or followed by a double dash can be infuriating after over 200 pages.Many a paragraph I skipped, seing absolutely no added value to it other than to ""prove"" to the reader that he can write. Personally, had the author been able to sustain my interest in his book, then I would have thought him a good writer.This book is long, and does present potential, but the reader must be extremely patient, and not have a better book sitting on a shelf just waiting to be read..."
2,Emperor of Ocean Park,"Although the general plot and storyline were interesting, the style and prose significantly interfered with my enjoyment of the book. It was difficult to get started and required a lot of concentration to get through. For example, on page 109, one sentence takes up the entire page! I also thought the author was somewhat pedantic--can anyone tell me what ""semiotician"" is--or ""decanal""? They weren't in any dictionaries I own...."
1,Overrated,"The book's main character is so self-important, race-conscious and unlikable that it makes the book very hard to read."
1,A bloated book with unlikeable characters,"I read this because my book club picked it. It was torture. Where was the editor? There isn't a single character I cared about and the ""mystery"" was utterly contrived.Carter's literary style was terrible. Perhaps if it would have been written in the third person it may have worked better. He constantly attributed thoughts and motives to people as if he were a third person narrator instead of a person witnessing an act, e.g. a third person narration can say, ""He didn't like the gift because it reminded him of his father,"" but a first person narrator can't know that unless told directly. That is the point--you look at events through a filter.I really disliked this book. I could go on and on and on and on and on and on and... until I fill 650+ pages like Carter did but I won't."
1,Frustration,I was so ready to read this book that got such rave reviews. DISAPPOINTING andFRUSTRATING best describes my feelings while reading this book. The author did not fully develop the characters and many could have been eliminated all together. The storyline was fragmented and disjointed. The ending was a mild surprise. No shattering revelation. There were many words but very little punch.
2,The Emperor of Ocean Park,"Far too much social commentary. Not that I didn't agree with it, but it slowed down the pace of the mystery to a crawl.It definitely was NOT a page turner, yet, again, the mystery tale itself was top notch. Carter should have stuck to that and left the commentary for some other book."
2,Lots of words; little reward,"Tedious. Not entertaining. The motto of this epic should be 'If 10 words will do, use 1000.' The author would make a great technical writer. He could give an excellent 500 page summary on how to build a watch. But don't read it if you don't have the time."
1,Spend your time on something more worthy of reading,"I thought if I would read long enough and gave this book a chance, it would start to get interesting, or that I would begin to care about what happens. I forced myself to read to the end of chapter 3 and put it down for good. I hated this book. It drags! Nobody wants to read a 650 page tiny print novel that drags! His writing style seems to be all about his extensive vocabulary. Yeah, you know a lot of words, but what's the point? By the end of the third chapter I was annoyed by practically every character introduced. I don't care who might have murdered ""the judge"", or why. In my opinion, time would be better spent on something else! Anything else!"
1,Boring....Long.....More Boring,"I think Carter spent way too much time developing the plot. The book was so detailed that reading it was a chore. The plot was mundane and Carter bored me the entire time. I wouldn't give this book to my enemy. In addition, the protragonist spends hours whining about being African-American and doing little to improve his situation. I would NOT recommend this book."
5,Perfect summer novel,My review will not be as complex as some of the others here; I simply want to congratulate Professor Carter on making such a stunning leap into the realm of fictional writing. I sincerely hope he continues to entertain those of us who bought and greatly enjoyed EMPEROR.
4,Harry Potter for Grown-Ups!,"I really enjoyed this page-turner and found many similarities to the first Harry Potter book--also by a first-time author. That is because, the narrator of this book, Talcott Garland, is constantly discovering that the world he thought he knew well-enough to take for granted, is not what it seems--and it is all because of secrets in the career of his father. Surprises at the end of every chapter keep the pages turning. I read this in a few days, taking the book with me on errands or in the car. I let the phone ring and the answering machine pick up. This is a perfect summer thriller. I bet this will make a good movie, too!"
2,the emperor of ocean park,"Verbose, slow moving, hard to stay with. I can't say much about the plot because I couldn't finish the book."
2,TOO LONG!,"Certainly this novel contained some interesting and insightful observations about American society, but generally, it disappointed. The ""mystery"" dragged through the first two thirds. Each chapter ended with an annoying pseudo-suspensful sentence that lead... nowhere. There was no character development beyond the initial impressions/sketches of each person, including the protagonist, Talcott, who remained a drip to the end, and his wife, ""Kimmer"", who, impossibly, grew more and more evil with each chapter. (Yet he loves her so!) There were, in fact, too many characters to keep track of or care about, especially in the law school. The political musings detracted from the story rather than adding to it. (At one point, Talcott walks past some sort of sub-par ghetto grammar school, and wishes his colleagues who don't support school vouchers could see this proof of their need. What?) The ending was corny and cliched. And did I mention it was too long?"
2,Officious Tedium,"Yes-It is way too long, but, moreover, Mr. Carter seems much more intent on developing in the reader appreciation for Carter's knowledge of law(ho hum)and his knowledge of chess(HO HUM)than in really developing characters that are either likeable or believable.The protagonist is a pontificating jerk. His wife has to be an airhead to fall for a pretty dumb basketball player-and she's a potential U.S.Circuit Court nominee-I don't think so! The rest of the characters are the biggest conglomeration of misfits, wierdos, neurotics and crooks I ever read about, especially ""the family"". I also am a lawyer, a chess player and have taught at prestigious law schools, and, frankly, law faculty and lawyers generally just ain't this bad. First time out-hope it's the last."
1,One book that needs a new editor!,"I had to read this book for a book club at work and it worse than reading one of those unabridged histories for college! The book includes way too many unimportant characters who may or may not have anything to do with the mystery that is sloppily unraveled at the end. There are some good moments but they're buried too deep. Most of us skimmed the book--too much background description for each person, place and thing."
2,"Overhyped, boring, unbelieveable!",I so wanted to love this book. I found all the poitical proselytizing so boring and repetitive. The dinner party and lunch scenes were particularly unbearable and there was not a likeable character in the whole book...
2,Too Long For A Thriller,"This booked steadily moved from five stars to two as the pages kept climbing. Why and editor didn't shake off some of the excess to get to the heart of the story is beyond me, but as it is I had a hard time staying interested after the first three hundred and fifty pages or so. The other problem I had with the book is I didn't find Carter's protagonist particularly likable.So for me I had a hard time connecting with the guy much less investing in his dilemma. Consequently by the time the novel climaxed in a cinematic stand off, there was little surprise or interest. Streamlined this could've been a taut page turning thriller. There were just too many pages to turn to get to the thrill."
2,there could have been a good book in there,"I tried twice, but couldn't get through the boring characters and whining crap from the characters. All the characters from the main family are a bunch of drips with nothing compelling to offer. There is a thread (in the first ~200 pages I read) of an interesting story, but I was regularly beaten down by diversions about the 'paler nation', PC junk, and generally uninteresting comparisons. Fortunately for the author the main characters were not white, so it will be easy for some readers to view their lameness as a great thing that defies 'stereotypes'.Too many pages, too much whining, too much plodding"
2,Tough going.,"I had read two of Carter's previous non-fiction works and enjoyed them, however after struggling through half of his first novel, I have to recommend that he stick with non-fiction. This novel is simply too plodding and dull to get through. The characters are unlikeable, the narrator is extremely repetitive, and the plot moves so slow it is almost as if it is an afterthought. It seems as if Carter is trying to make some points here about the black bourgeoisie which would be interesting if they were tied to a more lively entertaining novel with a discernable plot. Instead whatever insight he offers are bogged down by this ponderous effort at creating a mystery leaving the reader bored and exhausted."
3,Read this before you invest your time...,"The first few chapters of this book are riveting, but it seems to me that even Mr. Stephen Carter got tired of reading his own superfluously written words by the time the end finally rolled around. The ending of this book is the absolute worst - I have never felt so completely cheated in my entire reading life. By the time I had gotten to page 600 or so, I had the knawing sensation to put this down but, by that time, I had invested so much time and energy that I felt compelled to keep going. So sorry am I that I did. To be blunt, the conclusion of this book is not worth the time you'll spend reading, nor the paper on which it's printed."
5,Couldn't put it down,"Reading this book in bed at night, I didn't want to stop. The plot was riveting - there were so many twists and turns - you don't know the bad guys from the good guys. I was trying everything to stay awake, just so I could finish one more chapter. I think the author did a great job of making all the characters feel real and of painting a picture of family conflict. I loved this book - there was wonderful insights and character development."
3,Needs editing!,"The pages seem to turn themselves, but there are too many of them!The whole chess motif is wasted on a non-player and becomes boring, though it probably was intended to accent the novel's racial undertones. Unnecessary--they're obvious already.The judge, who starts down the slippery slope of criminality in an attempt to find justice for his daughter's death, is in many ways a sympathetic, understandable character. One wonders, though, why he did not place the ""arrangements"" in a bank safe deposit box with Misha having power of attorney. That would have shortened the novel considerably."
5,Now that's entertainment,"What a well written effort. I found myself running for the dictionary, as I read this wonderfully entertaining novel. Can one really call this search for one's father a murder mystery, hard to say. This book pleased me on so many levels. It was so well written that it was just a joy to read. The story it self, told from the perspective of an upper class, frightfully intelligent, and self effacing black man is a facet of society that I as a white Manhattenite have never even glimpsed at. I felt as though I was being taken into another neighborhood in which every one was interesting, flawed, brillant and absolutely real. I was sorry when I turned the last page. As a reader it was sad to get to the end of such a well wrought tale."
3,the endless read,"So Mr. Carter has a prestious vocabulary.........I actually had to renew this book at the library to get through it. In my opinion all of the characters in this drawn out ""who cares?"" saga deserve each other. Talk about getting a life! I was determined to finish this opus as I hate to be defeated by any author but it was touch and go all along. Other books were beckoning and perhaps I should have heeded the call. Never again unless Mr. Carter is able to write something under 400 pages."
2,"This is trite, but he shows promise as a novelist","Someone, somewhere should have told Stephen Carter that he is excessively verbose. After nearly 700 pages of racing toward ""the arrangements! the arrangements!"", it was a serious let-down when they only kind of came together.... The nearly innavigable twists and turns in the hackneyed thriller plot could give you some serious nausea.That said, the characters here are drawn very well and the observations about black middle class life were pointed and insightful. Nevertheless, the repetition, even in this, was enough to make me wonder if the editor wasn't allowed to cut anything?"
2,Race Overused,I am just on page 60. Being a voracious reader I will complete the book. His constant bringing up of the subjects race and ethnicity is to me somewhat alarming. It seems to appear on every page at least once it not several times. I hope the entire book is not this way.
4,Glad I made it through,"This is not a novel for anyone looking for a quick read. The book is well over 600 pages, contains 60+ chapters. I listened to the book on CD, all 20 CDs. Nevertheless, I did enjoy the novel. Like just about everyone here, I found the book to be a little long, and for those who enjoyed it the ""arrangements"" kept me listening to the bitter end. I would recommend this novel to others. My only added suggestion is that you might need a dictionary to understand some of the words (smile)."
3,Deserved more at the end,"As other reviewers have noted, this book is a long and sometimes tough and tedious read. That's not to say it isn't entertaining, because many parts were very interesting. However, when I finally got to the end, I guess I was expecting more of a reward for being so patient and dedicated. In short, the final outcome was disappointing in that it didn't satisfy some of the issues I had with a few of the characters throughout the book (ESPECIALLY with his wife Kimberly - she certainly did not deserve to be let off the hook so easily). Upon finishing, I did not have the good, satisfied feeling I enjoy having after finishing this type of complex read--I was mostly just like ""Eh, whatever. What's next?"" This was my first book by this author, and although I did enjoy his writing style, I'm not sure if I'll be brave enough to devote a good chunk of time to reading any more of his, for fear of being disappointed again."
3,Uninspired mystery,"Uninspired, formulaic writing. Way too many twists and turns in the plot, attempting to keep reader's interest, but instead, just cumbersome."
1,Too weak for a mystery novel,"This 654 page book could accomplish the same results in 300 pages and be more interesting. There is an excess of meaningless text that does nothing but interupt the basic plot, which is decent. While reading this book, I was thankful that I do not have to read his legal briefs."
2,"Pedantic, self-pitying, infuriatingly long book","This book and the main character are both so irritating that it is difficult to know where to begin. I wanted to smack Professor Garland and say ""Be a man!"". Instead he is a sniveling whiner. I sincerely hope this book is not autobiographical. The chip on this man's shoulder is more like the Rock of Gibralter!I agree with the reviews that say this book needed heavy editing. His descriptions are sooooooo long and tedious that I eventually found myself skipping over entire paragraphs. It is very difficult to warm up to a novel that has few, if any, really likable characters.To Professors Carter I give one piece of good advice - Don't give up your day job."
2,Too many useless characters,"It could have been very good if written using fewer characters. I think the whole story could have been accomplished without the brother Addison & cousin Sally--their clues could have easily been assigned to another of the numerous characters. Talcott's child could have made a brief appearance. I still don't know what ""dare you"" from the 3 year old was supposed to mean but having the kid throughout the book was boring. He could have cut down on some of the Law school fellow professors too. I lost track of the different professor's personalities after awhile. I agree with one reviewer who called it Harry Potter for grownups. I'd read another Carter novel--if there ever is one with the hope that it is a little less drawn out."
3,Too much detail,"Although the story was interesting, there was FAR too much detail in this book. I have to admit that I skimmed from about 50% read to about 80% read (Kindle edition). The detail was so annoying, I felt it detracted from the story. And at the end, the ""thing"" that was revealed was not that riviting (not after all the detail). Had I known the print copy of this book was 650 pages, I might not have started it at all, but once into it, I kept on. Really, it was an interesting story, but it could have been told just as effectively in 400 pages."
3,Solid work by promising author,"The fact that this book explores university politics featuring east coast black upper-middle class characters made it stand out from the pack, but once you get over this facet (which I did pretty quickly), what you're left with is a well written and fairly intriguing mystery, more memorable than some I've read, less so than others. I suppose a book like this one is an antidote to the urban/hip hop/gangsta/etc. genre of ""literature"", not so much because it features black characters who are articulate, educated and well to do, but because it was written by someone who fits this description. Ultimately I could care less if the narrator of a novel I'm reading is a college professor or a drug dealing pimp. I only care that the story is absorbing and the characters ring true, and this book did a decent if not quite extraordinary job of accomplishing that feat."
3,Hard Read,This novel was hard to understand. The story's direction was slow and painful for a group of lawyers. Throughout the novel are moments of ambiguity. The characterization of legal personalities in the novel left me disappointed. I am looking forward to the second novel with hopes of redemption.
2,"tedious, introspective, plot somewhat obscured so far","If you like to read lots of introspection and emotional responses to real and perceived race relations between individuals, this is the book for you. The mystery plot is rather obscured as most of the text is about the character's reactions to colleagues and his wife and other family and only about one thing per chapter occurs related to the mystery. But don't expect any action, at least in the first 200 pages, which is about as far as I have gotten. I am in doubt that I will finish it. I am not normally opposed to character development off the main plot, and often read British mysteries, for instance--but this is so extreme."
2,A sleep Inducer,"An intriguing mystery that coukld have been done with a third the length. Trying to separate the mystery's flow from the uninteresting deviations into the author's distaste of his treatment as a minority and into non-important and complex family traits is a numbing task. His adept handling of the language, however, is admirable. Insomniacs will appreciate it, though."
2,"Frustrating...I tried to like it, but unsatisfying ending.","(1) Too many secondary characters receive too much attention(2) A crucial character who is set-up to be intriguing turns out to have no impact on the plot at all(3) A big secret you were waiting for...is never revealed(4) Most of the characters are extremely self-absorbed(5) For a book that supposedly relates the experiences an unfamiliar world. I found very little that could be called insightful or even fresh.(6)There's a couple of nice passages that made me say ""right on!"" But not enough.(7) Sub-plots introduced early in the book have very abrupt endings midway through...muting their impact or cause you to wonder why it wasn't edited out.(8) At close to 700 pages the pacing was very inconsistent: at times I coudn't put it down, but more often I felt anchored in one spot for 50 to 100 pages at a time.(9) The tone was unremittingly downbeat."
3,The non-fiction version is better,"Carter is a very smart man. His writing hobby clearly rivals many of the pro's. However, one wishes that the editor had not gone on vacation: Too long, the plot is over-the-top, too many characters, lost plot lines. Less is more. On the positive side, it was neat to have major character development of one who only speaks from the grave. Kimmer was drawn exceptionally well.Mr. Carter: keep writing!!!! Your insights bring something different to the table."
1,I skipped whole passages and it still droned on and on and..,"One of the worst writing styles I've ever encountered. He repeats himself constantly and the minutiae of every little thing, thought or action irrelevant to the plot of the mystery had me skipping passages and reading only what was written in quotation marks. The pacing is awful, his sister is a pain in the *&%$!, he's a whining fool that desparately needs to give his wife a much deserved tongue lashing. I was curious enough about the mystery to stick it out, but will never read another book by this author - it was the worst! I really hate this book!"
2,A Slow Slide Downhill,"Devoured the beginning, plodded through the middle, & skimmed the last twenty pages just to say I read the whole thing. A very disappointing, unbelievable ending. Read my favorite short scene while you're in the bookstore-- pages 111-114 (the classroom scene with Avery Knowland); if you still have to read it, check it out from the library.I'm going to try Mr. Carter's non-fiction book, ""God's Name in Vain"" since I enjoyed his ""sideline soapbox passages"" more than the dialogue and action. Seems he was trying to reach every possible market with this thriller--rich, poor, middle-class, African-American, white, gay, straight, intellectual, young, happily married, unhappily married, FBI agent, etc. etc. etc.My worst complaint: didn't like the use of the phrases ""paler nation"" and ""darker nation."" Are these the next NEW politically correct ways to describe one's skin color? This verbose ""suspense thriller"" lost its thrill a page at a time."
2,Business or pleasure?,"Apparently, Carter has never heard the writerly dictum to 'show don't tell'. His characters are introduced with long wordy descriptions that reveal nothing. This discursiveness extents to every part of the writing, not just character creation. His dialogue is flat. His prose is flat. An MFA program would do him wonders. There's a good plot in there, but the book is a stylistic snooze that makes it hard to plod through."
2,so what was i supposed to get in this/,"i found this novel tedious at best.....and i have to admit i found carter's references to the paler nation and the darker nation a bit affrontive.....maybe i'm not attuned to the latest appelations of heritage being of the paler nation.....i plodded through this book primarily on Carter's reputation within the ranks of legal intelligencia, hoping for something more than i found....and found his budding novelist skills lacking....it didn't grab me, i did want to put it down often, and couldn't wait for it to end.....and its end i found disappointing, but i could not have ended it any differently.....his characterization was wonderful in his wife and son, both of whom he loved beyond himself......that was about the only redeeming element of this book...."
2,Overwritten and boring.,"The plot is long and involved. The protagonist is a wimp who earned my immediate dislike with his continuous cerebral contortions. There is an endless cast of cardboard characters, none of whom I cared about. The only reason I finished this book is because once I start a book, I make myself plod on no matter how hard the journey.I gave this book two stars for Mr. Carter's command of the English language which he unfailingly demonstrates to the reader at every opportunity."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I had Stephen Carter as a professor at Yale Law School, and like his IP class, this book SUCKS. The plot is slow and plodding (my arthritic grandfather moves faster), and the characters are unmoving and soulless. I can't even be sympathetic to Tal Garland because I HATE him. What a chump.Stephen Carter tries his hand at fiction, but only reveals his own crippling insecurities. Those of us who paid $120K for the privilege of his tutelage need not spend an additional [$$$] to find out what we already knew--SLC has major issues."
4,a new look,good read will continue with author;book in fair physical condition. will send on to others.
3,"from the synopsis, wanted to like it","I agree with some of the others, Talcott's situation is interesting enough to keep you reading. Chess moves are always a nice device to help you work out who done it. The interaction with his wife was just annoying and redundant. The Univ. characters were just not doing it for me. I didn't care about any of them enough to suspect them. Skipped over legal history as distracting."
2,Too much rambling......,not enough cloak and dagger. This story has great potential but I found that it is too bogged down with an overload of minutia that is a detraction. The mystery itself could have been very engrossing if one didn't have to wade through all of the dissertations that added nothing. The book is over 600 pages. The story could easily have been told in half that amount.
5,"Riveting Tale of Legal Intrigue, Romance and Family","Having been a longtime reader of Carter's non-fiction, I had to give him a try at this first novel.I cannot concur with many who find the length detrimental to the enjoyable read. If anything was a negative for this reviewer, it was my lack of vocabulary. Constantly turning to the dictionary for aid with such as ennui, flummoxed, etc., it is always good to be stretched and expanded.The twists and turns of the unfolding drama kept me interested and attuned to where the prose led. His style was not cumbersome and not predictable which lent itself to the large volume not being distracting to the overall pleasure of this read.The complex plot is intriguing and will capture the reader with its mixture of greed and family intwinement and legal collegiality and competition.Carter has sharp mind and talent as writer."
3,"good, but not great","It's a good read, but not a great one. The characters interested me, the idea of using the game of chess as a framework for the mystery and its clues was unique, and the book drew me in. However, at times the pace was plodding, and some of the characters remained mysterious throughout...I wanted to know more about them. It's a long book, and was mostly able to retain my interest, but I thought it could have been pared down and sharpened up a bit."
1,Quack,"Snooze fest...what a boring book. Having come to me so highly reccomended maybe I had too lofty expectations but boy was this book hard to get through. The plot takes forever to unfold, the characters mope around making no sense and in general even the scenery manages to be a bore. Bottom line, SKIP IT!"
1,The Emperor of Ocean Park,"Claudia Bernard said it all---why have you deleted her review!?This monstrous book is insultingly padded with superfluous verbiage. It might have been slightly more interesting if the multi-monickered protagonist had actually succumbed to his recurring red haze of anger and killed his wife, rather than passive-aggressively risking sabotage of her career. I suspect judicious editing would have resulted in a poorly written short story, at most. Our book group concluded that ""the Emporer has no clothes""!"
3,"Long read, not worth it","This book of over 600 pages has many interesting insights on the black/white racial situation, but degenerate into a dopey detective yarn in the last 100 pages."
1,Easily the worst book I've read in the past 10 years,Don't believe the hype! How such dreck commanded the attention and praise of the Today show producers and real critics is beyond me. B-O-R-I-N-G. The mystery was dreadful and predictable. The book didn't even live up to the subtext billing of a look at how the monied African-American society operates. I can't believe I finished it. What a waste of time.
2,The result of one fatally underworked editor,"Interesting story, even fascinating in parts, if a little smug, but good grief, could it have been any more prolix?? Next time Professor Carter, get a sterner editor."
2,"Where, oh where, are the editors of yesterday?","As someone once said of Henry James, he chewed more than he bit off. Same goes for Carter. Good idea, good characters, good story of a multi-generational, upper-middle class black family --but bad , really bad and boring interjection of a mystery (?) that goes nowhere. Why didn't some Harold Ross type put a stop to the flow? I finished it because I was taken with the family story, but found myself sighing with frustration whenever the author veered off into the mystery tangent. I'm sure Carter will produce better fiction - he has the gift, but he needs to tighten up the narrative."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I CANNOT BELIEVE I PLOUGHED THROUGH 600 PLUS PAGES OF THIS BOOK. IT IS FAR FROM LITERATURE AND IF THE AUTHOR WAS NOT A BLACK LAW PROFESSOR IT WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT OF DAY.IT IS SO TEDIOUS AND NEEDS MAJOR MAJOR CUTTING.THE WRITING IS AVERAGE, THERE ARE LOTS OF DISCREPENCIES A GOOD EDITOR WOULD HAVE CAUGHT. eg, THEY ORDER CRABCAKES AND RICE AND THEN THE CHARACTER IS LOOKING AT THE FRENCH FRIES ON HIS PLATE.THE WIFE, KIMMER IS ONE OF THE MOST ANNOYING, SELFCENTERED CHARACTERS I HAVE EVER CAME ACROSS.WHETHER THIS BOOK IS WRITEN BY A BLACK OR WHITE PERSON IT SHOULD HAVE TO MEET THE SAME STANDARDS AND THIS BOOK IS MOST UNSATISFYING."
1,Over-Rated Racial Garbage,"Maybe I'm just a middle-class white girl from Un-diverse Central Wisconsin, but this book was way too racial for me. I don't understand how race can consume your entire life, your every thought, your every action. The author is WAY too hung up on who is of the paler nation and who is of the darker nation, etc. It really distracted me from the book and I had to put it down halfway through. I don't even CARE who killed the judge. I really don't. Seemed Mr. Carter wanted to make some type of social statement that I just don't relate to. The only social statement I got from the book was that if a white person had written it in the same style, he would be considered a bigot."
1,"boring, boring, boring","a bad excuse for a 'recommended' book. too long, too coincidental, too boring. don't waste your money!"
2,"Confusing, Complicated, Boring","Carter writes well sometimes in this effort, although I much prefer his legal writing. And the context for the novel is an interesting one, a black America about which some know little (although not as many know as little as Carter seems to think). The problem here is simple, it's the story: laughably complicated and, ultimately, uninteresting. I'm still not altogether certain as to whom half of the people in the book ""work"" for (I don't want to get into plot specifics, but the comment betrays a serious failure of the novel). And, worse, I wonder why the Judge didn't just tell Addison the punchline before he died. It would have saved Prof. Carter and the rest of us so much tedium. Sadly, if the author were just another lawyer, no one would care anout this book. I looked forward to it, and I was disappointed."
1,This guy won't use 1 word where 25 will do.,"I wish I'd taken this book out of the library so I could have returned it after the first chapter. I bought it because the NY Times Book Review was favorable- the last time I'll trust that source. One does wonder if Mr. Carter even had an editor- or why the editor was reluctant to do his/her job. I did buy the book, so I was determined to finish it, and you know what?- it was not worth it. I got hopeful around chapter 44 that it was going somewhere exciting or at least interesting, but the ending was a disappointment. All in all, a waste of time."
3,Can you say paperback?,"Emperor of Ocean Park is really three books. One is quite interesting and good, the second is dull and the third is rushed and poorly done. When Carter is talking about upper class black life he's good. When he's preaching about race he's stiff. When he's trying to do the mystery elements he's terrible. Emperor cries out for a good editor and a ghost writer to fix the mystery. Instead it got one of the most impressive ad campaigns in recent history. Hype is powerful and can make a bestseller but it can't make a so-so book great. I'd say wait for the paperback to come out or go to library."
1,Get to the Point,"This book is about 500 pages too long.When you can skip entire chapters and not miss anything something is wrong.The politics and personel veiws are wrapped around a weak story , after we read the authors veiws for the 100 th time it really starts to drag.Not worth reading."
1,A John Grisham Knockoff,"This mystery is big, clunky, and tiresome. I think it's perfect for those who want to perfect the art of speed reading, because you can whip through the text and get to the plot without missing much of anything. There's loads of reflective thought that turns obsessive in a hurry, and boring and repetitive and irrelevant. I frankly thought this book was amateurish, but there's real glimmers of good writing here and there. You just never know when they're going to hit, and you have to work your way through so much blather that it's hardly worth the trouble. The characters aren't very interesting either. So what's to like? Not much."
1,"Smart writer, bad book","I have to agree with Michiko Kakutani's review in the New York Times yesterday, in which she referred to this book as: ""a contrived, implausible and needlessly baroque melodrama, which reads as if it were written for serial publication, with nearly every chapter ending on a hokey cliffhanger.""Mr. Carter is an accomplished, smart, admirable and even a brave writer in much of his non-fiction. This book, however, is a mess. I could not wait to read it after seeing the New Yorker profile a few weeks ago, but this is just a complete disappointment. The publisher's hype machine definitely got attention for this book - it's too bad that it just does not deliver. Stick to what you know, Mr. Carter."
1,law professor should stick to non-fiction,"A big disappointment from a writer who is much better at social commentary in non-fiction forms. The prose is stilted (and, for some reason, all in present tense), the plot is creaky, unweildy, and implausible, and somebody at his publisher should have gotten him a good editor. This book doesn't read as if it is by an author who has read or enjoyed thrillers. The ""cliff-hanging"" chapter endings are silly. It got a long review in the New York Times by someone who didn't know that a black bourgeoisie class existed. Maybe the book will be entertaining for this small and naive audience."
2,A 250-page thriller in a 652-page bore,"I decided to read 'The Emperor of Ocean Park' because the story sounded exciting: a postmortem message from an infamous black judge to his son. Mysterious (and sometimes grisly) deaths, a beautiful and mysterious stranger, and the mysterious disappearance of a scrapbook of awful memories. Mysterious, eh?The problem with this exciting tale is that it is buried in 400 pages of irritating commentary. The protagonist, Talcott Garland, is unhappy with everything: his allegedly unfaithful wife, the nasty politics and racial divide at the law school where he is professor, and just about everything else. Talcott has something snotty to tell us about every colleague and family member, and his self-pitying attitude makes him difficult to like. If you can stand the endless melodrama, you might be able to dig your way to an interesting mystery story."
1,Boring !!!,"This book was a nightmare ! The first 100 pages are ok, then you have to force yourself to continue, I tried really hard to finish this book but I gave up at page 330. No comments about the definitions ""paler nation"" / ""darker nation""...."
1,Maybe if it were 1/2 it's length...,"I kept hoping the book would pick up, so I got about half way through when I realized it wasn't going to get better. At that point, I can either stop reading, when I was about 300 pages already in, or keep going. I decided to keep going and it didn't really pay off. By the time you get to what I think the author considers the ""big reveals"", they are not satisfying. The characters behind the mysteries are confusing, and I found myself thinking, ""I don't even remember who this person is!"" The main questions that keep the lead character going are interesting, the book did not have to be over 600 pages! I also didn't care for the many references to the ""darker"" or ""paler"" nation as a reference to someone's race. John Grisham writes far better legal fiction, predominately in the south, without making such strange references to race."
2,Shall I finish it?,"This is a new one for me. I've read over 700 pages but I'm here to check the reviews to decide whether I should finish it? Some of the big mysteries are solved but not all of them - just not sure I care. I think the overall story is good - the suprises so far are believable yet suprising - unlike some other authors - but there are just way too many words. I do think he can turn a phrase...but it appears no one edited him? The editor did not do this author any favors in the end. After reading what I've read here, I will go back and finish .. what's another 100 pages...but I won't be buying anything more by this author"
3,The ultimate in complainers,"This book has an interesting plot, but he seems (80% of the time) to be either complaining about his marital problems or his dismal feelings about the ""paler nation."" I liked the story, but at times wished the central character didn't have SO many black vs white issues."
2,A little less more and a lot more less,"I share the same likes and dislikes as much of the other reviewers regarding Carter's fiction debut. At times, I wanted Carter to quit going through so many contortions to get from one scene to another (like the Misha nickname, one is led through a twisting, winding path to get to the conclusion of said scenes and it seems as if Carter forgot that the quickest way to get from point A to point B is a straight line) and just get on with it.I think the main problem with the book is that there were too many coincedences and too many characters introduced as a matter of convenience. And the deus ex machina of the hurricane was a bit much, but hey, if you're gonna get it on the big screen you need a big climax."
2,"There is a story here somewhere, but...","The writer, though apparently acomplished in his technical field, could use a writers workshop before embarking on a second work of fiction. I grew bored with the almost continuous stream of 'new' characters that just happened to have some sort of relationship with the character to keep the plot twisting along that where introduced and dismissed every 30 pages or so. It seems that few characters are ever allowed to take on more than one dimension in this story. I don't need to like the main character to enjoy a story, but I ask for more substance to his personality to make up for it. The main character comes across a shallow and never seems to really develop a motivation for his actions, beliefs and emotions."
4,Fantastic....Classic at end,"The Emperor of Ocean Park, did re-new my spark in legal thrillers...the scences, the descriptions were top rate, to say the least...however, as what appears to have become part of contemporary literatry, the ending was plain and suspect.I recomend this book to everyone, however realise it is Prof. Carter's first fiction novel and the cob-webs of teaching at Yale are still present."
2,Too Implausable,Interesting but tiring.The author uses way too many pages to tell an implausable story of corrupt judges and a host of characters with very little to recommend them but driving ambition.By the time one finally ties everything together it has taken so long to unravel one hardly cares anymore.
3,Entertaining,"Hokey cliffhangers or not, once I got past a slow beginning, I was hooked. I wouldn't call this literature, and certainly the book missed a number of opportunities as other reviewers have suggested but all the same, I enjoyed reading it and appreciated the escape."
5,"Intricate, smart and challenging","The beauty about this book is it's cadence and the way the story fits together. It's a long book (more than 600 pages) but it's also a page turner. Each chapter leaves you with a feeling of wanting to keep on reading. It's not only a thriller -- although Professor Carter does a good job of developing the plot -- but it's also social commentary. There a golden nuggets of cynicism and irony scattered throughout, commenting on society, ethics, morality and the legal community in Washington and elsewhere. It's worth the read. Reviewers who call this a boring book should go buy Grisham or rent a movie. This is a literary work, not just a bestseller."
4,"nice read intellectually, perhaps too complex as a thriller","I liked the book -- especially its subplots on chess and middle class African American society. As a thriller, I found it bordering on convuluted, but as a novel I thought it worked pretty well."
2,Go straight to Audio,"You know how some movies just don't make on the big screen but do much better on video...That is what I have to say about this book. I got this book from two different libraries because I couldn't finish in the timeframe. Then I gave up and went to books on tape..well that was in two parts, I didn't find this out until I got to tape 10 and it was the end of tape set.I went back to library and got abridged CD and finally finished the book. This process took from Labor Day weekend until the end of October. The story just was no worth it, I don't see how this author got all this hype for such a long draw out story. Plus I have a problem with the reference ""Darker Nation"". I only finished because I hate to start a book and not finish ..especially a mystery...so go straight to Audio"
1,The Emporer of Ocean Park,"This book was tedious, dull and in the end inconprehensible. The characters are stick figures. Marriages disintegrate and yet the couples never once talk about any of their problems. The central mystery of the book is left in the dumpster. Every other sentence is a run on screed about how awful white people are to black people. If that were really true I don't think this book would have gotten a single good review. Do yourself a favor and bypass this one."
2,"Get rid of the victim stuff, Mr. Carter! -Please!","Delete the never-ending ""black victim"" stuff and I could probably give this book a 5 or at least a 4 - I think. My hesitation about a revised rating stems from the fact that I'm still trying to get through the book without ripping up the photo of the author on the back jacket cover. Carter seems to be a talented story-teller, but his ""issues"" are distracting...It's hard to view a real life (or fictional life) law professor as a victim...Seems like millions of real life (and fictional life) ""paler nation"" (Carter's phrase) folks would love his lifestyle! -Amen"
1,Don't waste your time...,"While there is an occasional - very occasional - nice turn of phrase here, the book as a whole is awful; dull, downbeat, endless and unengaging. There is not one redeeming character to be found and the protagonist ranks among the stupidest and wimpiest ever to see print."
5,Good Mystery with intellectual challenges,"I found this book to be an excellent tale as well as challenging in my concepts in areas such as, politics, morals, religion and race. This author gives us a great perspective in areas that I would not ordinarily have considered as well as a good mystery. Good Book!!"
4,Stellar debut!,"I was extremely hesitant to read this book after seeing what the critics had to say about it--and I'm not much to follow their lead. And it is perhaps for this reason that I was so pleasantly surprised. The writing is stellar and Carter deserves whatever recognition he's received so far. My only hesitation with this book was the character of the ""wife."" Man, talk about your unlikeable characters! If only Stephen Carter had done something to make her a little more likeable.Also recommended: McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD and ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE"
2,High hopes; meager pay-off,"""As so often, I am the first to speak, and what I say is utterly stupid."" The narrator of THE EMPEROR OF OCEAN PARK speaks to the reader through 64 over-long and cliche-ridden chapters. (The quote above opens up chapter 51... and by then, we know the narrator is telling us the truth.) The plot is a stacked deck; the characters are good, but he uses them unimaginatively. Stephen L. Carter has written some wonderful non-fiction books. But his first novel is slow, dull, terribly long-winded and full of stock characters and situations. I was surprised and disappointed, almost from beginning to end."
1,The Corporate Hype Machine Rolls Again...,I'm sorry. Was I supposed to say anything else?You KNOW his publisher has to pump up this book to recoup their [$$$] Mil advance.
1,"Not a murder myster, but a one sided debate on race in USA","Carter has written a 657 book on racisim in America, which is a very important subject, however he was paid to write a murder mystery. From the first page it is obvious that the mysterious murder of his judge father is only a subplot. Conversations that lead to evidence are broken allowing the author to vent on race, affirmative action, and his never ending fear that his wife is cheating on him. I could not get into this book. I found myself skiming pages, trying to find some, any, element of plot in this heavy handed, one-sided, lecture on how Carter views race relations in America. Maybe he should write that book and not a surgar coated nonexistant murder mystery."
3,Much too long and far too slow,"The Emperor of Ocean Park is much too long and far too slow in terms of its plot development. Essentially it is the story of a Black Ivy League Law Professor long dominated by his father who is a Federal Judge. After his father's death egged on by his apparently paranoid sister, he is caught up in trying to ascertain whether or not the death is murder, or from natural causes. Add to this the fact that he is a wimp who is almost sure that his wife is cheating on him, but refuses to do anything about it. It was at times an excruciating read. I kept talking to our narrator urging him to act like a real man and was estatic when I finally got to the end of the book."
2,Not worth the time,"I rarely give up on books but after 450 pages, I called it finished. Carter insists on writing everything down with no filtering whatsoever. Unfortunately, what he has to say is not very enlightening, even for one who has very little knowledge of upper middle-class African-American or the academic life. The mystery was so uninteresting-though convoluted- that I have no curiousity at all about the outcome. A disappointing read."
2,Overwritten and Overrated,"At 650 pages, ""The Emperor of Ocean Park"" desperately needed the attention of an editor. The text could easily have been reduced by 20 percent without damaging the storyline.And while it's not mandatory that I like the protagonists of the books I read, it helps. I realize that he's a law school professor, not an action hero, but I tired of Talcott Garland's continued weakness, particularly the way he dealt with his wife's adultery and self-serving behavior.At 650 pages, the pay-off isn't worth the effort."
1,A Frustrating Read,"My advice to anyone considering spending 16+ dollars on this book is to burn it instead. this book is horrible. it seems as if it was intended for serial publication- it ends every other chapter with a hackeneyed ""twist"". and then there is the length. the author manages to drone on for 60 pages about nothing. when you reach the end (if you manage to) you'll kick yourself for wasting three days. my verdict- stay away!"
3,Too Much Descriptions and Other.......,The story was pretty good. But there was just to much description and too much detail that made the story long very hard to read. Sometimes it better to stay with the point of the story. This book had a lot of boring details that could have been eliminated. But I will say it got my interest to learn about the game of chess. I read a lot of books and this was just too long.
2,A Waste of Prime Summer Reading Time,"A more appropriate title would be ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". I heard that a lot of people were enjoying this book so I thought I would join in the fun. This book took me weeks and weeks to finish and it would seem as if it would be days before anything interesting would happen. I did manage to finish it, but was not really pleased with the book. I can't even remember how it ended, to tell you the truth. I would urge you to avoid this book unless you want to be bored stiff."
3,The Wimp of Ocean Park,"650+ pages felt too long for this novel. The repeated references to the 'paler nation' also grew old. OK you are black, I don't need it hammered into my head page after page.The story, when it was not drowned out by various tangents, holds up. However Misha is mush. Where's the backbone? Stand up to your wife - let me get this straight: she's cheating on you, and then she kicks YOU out of the house? Misha is scared of his own shawdow and is hard to root for.I'll admit this book may be too subtle for my taste, I'm an Ayn Rand fan. Nonetheless after 300 pages I was determined to finish and enjoyed the book enough despite the lead character I wanted to give a pep talk to."
3,Too long by far,"I was excited to get my hands on this book and read the opening with alacrity. By the time I got 150 pages in, though, I knew I was in for a long haul.The social commentary is incisive and fresh. Even if you don't agree with Carter's observations, it's hard to find fault with their fairness. The problem is that by the midpoint of the book, he is reduced to repeating himself, and the reader is left with the threadbare thriller plot for company.The closer I got to the ending, the more I skimmed. I am convinced that 200 pages of this book could have been cut. As it was, I was mostly thrilled to finish the book because it allowed me to go on to a new one."
1,The Emperor of Ocean Park,"Stephen L. Carter has written some significant books. His academic qualifications are unquestioned. Unfortunately, his ability to write mystery stories or serious novels is in serious question. This book could easily be 200 pages and 10,000 adjectives shorter. Talcott, the hero of the story, and the son of the Emperor of Ocean Park is as unsympathetic a protagonist as you could ever want. I didn't care for this book at all. And I definitely won't be reading Mr. Carter's next novel.What concerns me the most about this book is the incredible buzz surrounding its release. I cannot imagine how reputable critics were willing to give this novel a favorable review. It is a ponderous and clumsy effort at writing fiction by a man who should either stick to writing non-fiction or who should practice more before he publishes another novel. If you want a good read give this one a miss."
3,Fire is started but never explodes,"This was a very fancy murder mystery that doesn't quite fulfil its emotional direction. All the bones are there for more of a literary novel, but it stops short. There should have been more tension and more angst, but except for Misha's love for his wife and son, there is no sense of much emotion except curiosity. There are some desultory passages of antagonism and confrontation, but not enough fire or engagement. Passion is too vaguely expressed, and there is too indistinct expression of why anything motivates Misha. I was disappointed. So much was promising - a black, middle-class professor, tenured, married to a Supreme Court nominee, a father with a complicated history which threatens to destroy the son's successful life, surprising deaths, FBI and CIA participation in the shadows, a mafia monster boss - and the story never breathes. Sigh."
1,Not airtight,"This container is not airtight. The lid, where it attaches to the container, has a good seal. However, the flap on top does not. If you upend the thing, the top flaps open. It's well-constructed otherwise, but this is a pretty obvious--and avoidable--design flaw for something supposedly intended to preserve coffee.I would definitely not buy this again."
1,wrong music for this cd,All tunes except the last :32 piece is not virtual audio project 'Psychosis'. New to this .....How do you report this? thank you
2,Rattle Snakes,"I was disappointed in this dvd. It was just a bunch of clips of them catching snakes, not tracking them. A lot of snakes are caught, but it wasn't very thrilling."
2,Original Recordings Poor Quality,These are the original recordings from someones collection that had been played repeatedly. It is poor sound quality at its best but beautiful music if you don't mind all of the scratches and pops. These are not cleaned and filtered.
2,Music of Anton Karas,"The indelible sound of Anton Karas and his zither was to take me back to my childhood (well so I hoped) but unfortunately this wasn't to be. The double disc album seems far too copious in my view, and needs some severe editing to prune out what could best be described as just 'fiddling' on a zither. Its a wonderful instrument in the right hands and Karas has the touch but this isn't supported by the music in this case. One of the discs in this album wouldn't read and that substantially reduced overall effectiveness.The 'third man theme' which launched Karas as an icon of the 50's remains his best in my view, with the revised version better still. I found the album bit disappointing overall.Bill Gifford"
1,flimsy,"After 5 months, my drive is in the trash. The connector part is very flimsy and snapped completely off the board after what I consider to be only routine wear and tear. I paid less than 1/2 list price, similar to what Amazon is selling it for now. I never had a problem before with it, but then again my very old 128MB is bigger but also sturdier and still works."
1,Bad batch maby?,"About 50% of the files I copy to the drive are damaged.PNY is a very reputable company, but they must have gotten a bad batch, bought three of these here and all of them do this, on all 13 computers at work."
1,Falls Apart,"I've really got no complaints about the performance of this drive. It was fine for my purposes. BUT, after only a few months I went to remove it from my computer and the USB connector broke away from the case. Dead drive and lost data. From this experience I'd have to say it has pretty shoddy construction. I had a problem with another PNY flash drive and would never buy another one."
1,Bad Product,I ussually go for technology that's been on the market a while so i can get it cheaper and almost always more stable. I decided to go out on a limb with this and man was i wrong... it does not work!!! the flash drive corrupts every file i put into it i formatted the drive in winXP and in mac OSX and nothing there's no way around it. Right now i'm going to contact the company so i can get support or a refund.
1,Another bad batch?,"I was skeptical of the bad reviews but I encountered read/write errors on large file transfers (+200Mb) as I wanted to use it to backup my hard drive. The problem seems to be with .mp3, .wma and .jpg files. I also had some corruption issues with other media files and adobe files. It seemed to be ok for smaller transfers and non-media documents like spreadsheets and word docs. Took it back to the store and went back to my 1GB Sandisk USB drive. This is my 3rd USB drive (1st 128MB Sandisk, 2nd 1GB Sandisk) and I am going to get a Sandisk product for my 8GB stick.Sorry PNY...you lost my business."
1,Just doesn't work,I bought this because of the price vs storage and the PNY name. I carry alot of files and graphics with me for work.It looked like I transfered files to the unit but when I was on the road and tried to copy them to a customer nothing worked.All the files are Corrupted.I am sorry to say this is worthless. The 1G version seems to work just fine.
1,Didn't Last Too Long,"This product did not last long at all. It worked for the first few days or so, and that was it... crashed"
2,Pass On This One,"I've always used SanDisk Flash Drives, but this one was on sale so I thought I would try it. First thing I noticed is the cap is extremely loose, so it would have to be taped on or completely left off, or you'll definitely lose it. But the major problem I encountered is it's reluctance to work with Window's Vista with occasional freeze ups, and difficulty deleting data and formatting. However, it does work well with Window's XP. But still highly recommend the SanDisk.SanDisk Cruzer Micro 8 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive (SDCZ6-8192-A11, Retail Package)"
1,Bad Read/Write,"Seems to be the same as many others. Bad read/write to drive and if you do a bulk copy, first file is OK but all others reading are corrupt. Trying to RMA now... Would not recommend this drive... but have had good success with all my other PNY USB drives (128, 512, 1Gb, 2GB) BUT NOT the 8Gb version."
4,Amazing Portable Flash Drive,"This product is highly recommended, because is useful, cheap and full portable, moreover is so secure about your use"
4,raw format,"Pc could not read pny 8gb flash drive because of raw format,I reformated in fat32, works great now."
3,Revenge of the Whale,"This book is an interesting book. In this book the main characters are Thomas Nickerson a cabin boy aboard the whale ship Essex, the first mate Owen Chase, and the captain George Pollard Jr. This book starts out in a place in New England called Nantucket. Then as the book progresses the rest of the book pretty much takes place on the sea.This book is an interesting book because it is interesting to learn about whaling. One thing that amazed me was how dangerous whaling could be. It sounded not only dangerous, but a job that required a lot of skill. If you like whaling stories this is the right book for you. If you are a person who likes survival stories this is a great book for you. Also if you like stories that take place at sea this is also the perfect book for you. This book was adapted from the National Book Award-Winner In the Heart of the Sea. So, if you like the book in the heart of the sea I would advise this book.~ Nico"
2,Cute but....,"The cards are cute but.. We are in the pecan business and the ""squirrel"" looks like to us to be a chipmonk. I personal collect squirrels and it doesn't look like any I have from all over the world. Also the card picture isn't done well around the edges. And ther are 10 cards in a box, I had to buy them to find out. Lori"
4,WOW!,So I got the book when one of the kid's Therapists sends me a sample sleeping schedule based on this book. It took me 2 weeks to adjust my twins' schedule and all I can say is WOW! I gave it 4 stars because I started reading the book....
4,Full of great info! Great book!!,"I love this book. Although this is not nessesarily a ""solutions based"" book, what it will give you is some key information on a wide array of sleeping issues, and will help you to find a way to deal with your children based on your family's particular needs. I found it very conforting to know that yes, some kids do have a hard time regulating themselves in terms of sleeping patterns (and why), it made me feel releived to know that it is not all me and my lack of being able to get my kids into a routine and keep them in it. We all know that some kids are wired differently, but this actualy explains why and this understanding helps us to parent them more effectively. The author succeded in creating a well written book that is not only informative but enjoyable to read, using great analogies throughout."
3,A good example of Oscar's work for Atlantic,"I don't find Oscar's Atlantic recordings as easy to listen to as his Columbia or Fontana work. The heavier soul style arrangements do tend to obscure the lyrics somewhat. I must give it another play; I've never noticed the objectionable language referred to in other reviews. That said, Oscar's observations on life are always worth a listen. This certainly isn't my favourite Oscar Brown Jr album but I do get something from it when I play it."
5,It's wonderful...,"I listened to this tape when I was very little, probably about three. It captivated me then, and instilled in me a fascination with this opera that haunts me still, over 12 years later. I would definately recommend it for your children!"
5,"Nothing gets past this thing, except liquid.","This strainer is the best one I have ever seen after trying many. We've had it for over a month and it looks like new still. It's wide metal rim fits easily into the drain and flush with the bottom of the sink so nothing gets by it. It's super easy to clean, not being mesh, but very small holes. The whole thing is stainless steel. You can just use a sponge to clean it out thoroughly, quickly and easily. I'm about to get another one for another sink."
5,The Best Sink Strainer!,"I don't always take the time to write reviews but for this little product, it was a must! After using this sink strainer fora good amount of time, I can honestly say that I will never use another one of those mesh strainers again. Unlike the mesh typestrainers, this one doesn't rust or get clogged up. It has mainatined it's beautiful finish and shine. This sink strainer is definitely a ""keeper""! I would definitely purchase this item again (although the way it holds up, I don't see that happening anytimein the near future)."
3,Okay.,"Fits average sized sink drain, light-weight steel, but slips around on the drain because there is nothing to give it ""grip;"" therefore, food remains can enter drain."
5,One Piece Design f/ Better Life,We had a different brand of strainer in our kitchen sink and it broke because the it was a two piece design. The ring came separated from the strainer basket. The RSVP Endurance on the other hand is one-piece and appears to be well built. It is also a bit easier to clean because it's not a mesh design like our old one.
2,The profit margin is just to high.,This item should be selling for 1/2 of what it being offered. You coiuld make it in volumei if you lowered the price but that is not the only point. At some multiple the profit ratio is just to high and the prices are too high. You need more competion to force you to lower your prices.
4,Good Strainer!,That's what exactly I've been long looking for. It's strong enough and broad enough. The only disadvantage is that it's a bit difficult to get the trash out of it.
2,"More trouble, more work",This rests inside your drain but it actually blocks the water flow and pools around its edges. Food scraps cannot fall into it either for the same reason.
5,Not one of those flimsy things....,This is a nice solid sink strainer - that fits our kitchen drain as if it was made for it. Nice quality.. not one of those flimsy mesh things. I recommend it.
4,Sturdy but il fitting,"The strainer is a nice design with very sturdy construction, and it's easy to clean out. The stainless steel is polished enough to almost look like chrome. However, it is a little small for the garbage disposal sink drain. It slides around in the opening enough to see the disposals metal lip.My reason for buying this strainer is to keep items (silverware) from inadvertently falling into the disposal without notice. I'm sure we've all heard the loud crunching of our silverware that has fallen into the disposal unnoticed then turned on the disposal. I've got 2 or 3 chewed up spoons in my drawer! The strainer is a little small but not so small that it allows silverware to slip into the drain.I recommend the strainer."
2,safe track,while it was alright LL COOL J.Settled for a Middle of the Road track here.It works alright for Him but doesnt merit mention amongest His Better Material that He has done over His Long Career.I Like a Couple of Parts of this Cut but overall I ain't feeling it to much.pretty safe track.
4,PHAT,yo i got tha cd about a week ago and i can't stop rockin' to it . these ni**as are real hardcore . they come off nice on all tha tracks.if you were thinking of getting this cd go cop it cause it's hella good dunnn !
5,The phattest Hip Hop album of 1998! Pure underground!,"The production by Primo,Laze E Laze and M.O.P. themselves is tight as always and lyrically they're better than ever before! By the way, this album is nothing for the pop-audience, listening to Puff and LL, this is something for the real heads. ""How about some hardcore!"""
5,m.o.p. for life,"Latly m.o.p. have been blowing up large with the radio play of ante up and cold as ice, but a lot of people don't know they have been around for years, first family 4 life is there 4th album and maybe the best they have done.The album's first song is the best track on the album (rules of the game)and is produced by the greatest of all time dj premier ,who also does five other tracks on the album but m.o.p. grow on this cd by producing some of the tracks themselves and they all work. The vocals are dope and underated. The only thing wrong with first family is a cheap tune with jay-z but apart from that a classic."
2,A dissapointing album,"Four alarm blaze was really good, but the rest of the album smelled like fish. They should have tried a little better not to rip people off!!!!!!!!"
5,Solid little laser tool.,"So far so very good. I am horrible at keeping level over long distances and a laser is a must. SO far I have used the unit to level for a pool, cabinet installations and trim work. The laser is accurate and has been flawless so far. I baby the unit as it seems a bit fragile so it always stays in the case and i bought the tripod. Note if you get the tripod it comes with the threaded swivel head so you dont need to order one seperate, Amazon shows them as a seperate item, but they took it back without issue."
3,detector + grade rod mismatch,"This is a nice laser as described in the previous reviews, but I wanted to note a minor engineering defect: The SLD Detector mount does not fit on the bottom section (largest) of the PLS grade rod (without prying off the rubber feet, which makes it slide easier on the aluminum rod, which is undesireable). Poor design.... the SLD Detector mount should fit the grade rod (both made by PLS). When I contacted PLS, they basically said there is no fix and have a nice day. Annoying."
4,Vivaldi's Ring of Mystery,My kids got the set for Christmas and both have come to like classical musical. It is one of many kinds of music they listen to. This is very good because it tells a story and plays music as well.
2,Big disappointment,"I ordered this after hearing the smart and wonderfully creative ""Beethoven Lives Upstairs."" While it does contain a sampling of Mozart's music, the story is set within the fantacy of one of Mozart's operas. So, it doesn't contain the informative background information about Mozart and his life like the Beehoven volume. Children will still probably enjoy it, but don't it doesn't really help them appreciate Mozart. It's just a fanciful story set to some of Mozart's most famous compositions."
2,Irritates Mom -- Delights Child,I love everything in the Classical Kids series except this and the lullabyes. Some of the voices of the characters in this really irritate me. I find the entire cd annoying. The story is simple and dull. I rarely play this one because it bugs me so much.
3,Could be better,"I bought this to prepare my preschooler for a kids' concert of The Magic Flute. It did help introduce him to the music, but the tracks are broken up strangely leaving bad breaks in the music. That was distracting. I'd go with a more traditional rendition of the opera."
5,Grand kids love it,"I put it on in the car to keep them from fighting or getting loud. They were quickly entranced and ask for it. The music is well-played, and the story is very appropriate for my bright 6 and 8 year old grands, especially as the 8 year old plays flute."
3,Gift for my granddaughter,"I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter who already had ""Beethoven Lives Upstairs."" She says it is interesting, but not as good as the Beethoven one."
3,"OK, but dated","I probably should have researched this more before buying... it really is out of date and I also didn't find much in the included samples disk that were really that great, in my opinion. Still, it's interesting reading."
3,Sampling / Production,"It's exactly what it says it is. Might be a little overwhelming for a beginner, but not a bad book."
1,Evil book,"I was expecting a book that would explain how to record and alter samples to use with the pads on my MIDI controller. Instead I got a book on how to rip off other people's music without getting sued. If you are an honest musician who wants to create everything yourself, then this book is not for you. On the otherhand, if you want to be like Vanilla Ice, then this is a great book."
3,THIS IS BEGING BOOK,"IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SAMPLES.YOU SHOULD LOOK AT IT .BUT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW ""HOW"" PEOPLE USE SAMPLES MAKE MUSIC .THIS IS NOT YOU WANT."
4,A new idea for an alternate Gettysburg,"Although this books is classed as ""juvenile fiction"" and is perhaps not as complex as a novel for adults, Gibboney has come up with an original idea in the treatment of Gettysburg that makes the book worth reading by any alternate history fan. I.e., that the battle might have been fought elsewhere. Now admittedly there have been few other novel-length treatments of an alternate Gettysburg (Tsouras's detailed book is the only one that springs to mind), but Gibboney is apaprently the first to describe how a bad first day at Gettysburg could have led the Union to retreat, and the climatic battle is fought somewhere down the road. Thus, in Gibboney's world, we would today be still talking about the Battle of Taneytown."
1,Misleading Title,"I am a native of Gettysburg and a student of the battle. I was looking forward to Douglas Gibboney's book as I have often wondered how the battle might have been influenced by the presence of Stonewall Jackson.Gibboney moves the battle out of Gettysburg after the first day which is probably what Jackson would have convinced Lee to do, but in that case, the title is misleading. I was disappointed."
4,An intersting twist,"This work provides an entertaining look into what may have transpired during the Battle of Gettysburg. True, the outcome may have been different, but one can never really know.I'm often asked, ""...what would Jackson have done at Gettysburg if he were alive."", and my response usually is, - ""Stink, since he'd been dead for a while"". Now there is at least one new senerio for the armchair historian to ponder.Quite interesting and a fun read."
2,Not the best Erotica,"This is a decent effort as far as erotic story writing. The short stories such as the oh so romantic ""Our Place"" where a married couple enjoyed their country life farmhouse to the steamy and hot ""Old neighbor, new neighbor"" where a neighbor fantasize about another man's wife. Some of the stories are repetitive and can get boring at times. Some stories grab your attention but don't leave a everlasting expression. This is not a book that you would read more than once, unless you like repetitive stuff. I had to skip some stories because it was too boring. This is an okay read, not the best Erotica that people are raving about. There's are far better intelligent/creative Erotica books out there. This one is not one of them."
2,Not a Huge Fan,My children didn't find these CDs as interesting as most others who posted reviews. It is hard to leave them in the CD player because I find myself caught off guard when the player rotates over the a CD with a narrator. We haven't listened to them nearly as much as I would have expected.
1,BEWARE: AMAZON SHIPS TENNYSON INSTEAD OF BARONESS PATTERN,"While the box was labeled correctly, i.e., ""Royal Doulton Baroness"" the item enclosed was the ""Tennyson"" pattern. I've noticed other customer reviews involving purchase of Royal Daulton from Amazon with similar problems so what I experienced is a recurring problem. Some customers also relate that when they return the item for an ""exchange"" the replacement item is also the wrong pattern. Obtaining a refund requires a telephone call to customer service and also requires that you take the item to the U.S. Post Office. Since this is an Amazon mistake you would expect they would pick the item up at the shipping location, but that is not the case. Royal Doulton has outlet stores which ship items for free, don't charge sales tax and whose prices and customer service are superior to Amazon."
4,Great Story,A Great story that shows us a truth --itwas delivered quickly and was fairly priced -- and we enjoyed it a lot tyty Jay L.
3,You'll need to skim read this one!,"Very old fashioned, but readable, Quite slow moving and I have read other books by this author and she (presume its a she) takes a long time to get to the point. Most of it is quite unbelievable and very old style."
3,Choro superstars,"Choro is an instrumental style that perhaps overlaps slightly with U.S. jazz. It is more highbrow than most Brazilian musical traditions (for instance, ""Bachianas Brasileiras #5"" is by the classical composer Villa-Lobos, who also wrote choros) and this CD is the most self-consciously arty of the popular Brazilian music I've heard, perhaps all the more because it's an Event, a gathering of some of the biggest names in choro. I like it better each time I hear it, which probably means it deserves more than three stars - but it does call for close, conscious listening."
3,There's sure to be a better Databases textbook out there.,"I took this course from Dr. Riccardi himself at FSU. To be fair, the book was still in the development stage when I had his class. However, I found that the examples in the book never quite communicated the idea he was attempting to communicate. The examples were not simple enough, and very often showed multiple concepts which tended to take away from the effectiveness of the example.The book is also a bit confusing. There are a lot of terms that have been carefully defined, however, similar sounding terms have a completely different connotation.Although Java is not a stated prerequisite to this course, I would recommend having Java either before taking the class or during the same semester. Later in the book there are some assignments in Java. The author expected the class to be comfortable with reading and modifying Java source code."
2,Doesn't explain details,"This book goes too much in detail about using an Access Database with Java. Who does that in the real world?Doesn't use a good real world example, and explanations are not very clear."
3,Game over!!!,"BOFF!!!Étant un très grand fan d'I.N.je trouve que cet albumet ses deux prédécesseurs(Nihil,Abscence of war...)sontsurévalué.Non pas que c'est mauvais,au contraire,production etagressivité sont au rendez-vous mais si vous vous attendez àentendre DU VRAI Impaled Nazarene,oubliez cà.I.N. est à la base un groupe de nuclear metal déchainé,pervers,satanique et chaotique avec le son qui va avec.Rien à voir aveccette nouvelle direction au riffs power/black.Dans mon coeur,I.N. cà s'arrète à (Latex Cult/1996)."
4,MAYTAG SKYBOX MBR1980AAB,"I PURCHASED 4 OF THESE 4 YEARS AGO FOR CHRISTMAS. 1 FOR MYSELF, 1 FOR MY SON, & 2 FOR MY SON-IN-LAWS. THEY ARE ALL WORKING FINE. MINE RUNS ALL OF THE TIME. THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT I HAVE HAD IS THE DOOR PANEL HAS BECOME BRITTLE AND CRACKED. I ALSO CHECKED THE MAYTAG SITE & FOUND NO RECORD OF THE SKYBOX; SO I GOOGLED IT AND WAS LINKED TO AMAZON.COM, WHO LINKED ME TO [...]. I HAVE ORDERED A NEW PANEL & EXPECT TO GET IT IN THE NEXT WEEK. WITHOUT THE DOOR PANEL IT LOOKS BAD, BUT IT RUNS PERFECTLY.MY SKYBOX ROOKIE DOOR PANEL, ARRIVED TODAY SEPTEMBER 9,2009. VERY FAST DELIVERY FROM PARTS [...]. IT LOOKS GREAT NOW. THIS PRODUCT I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND, IF IT IS STILL AVAILABLE."
1,Beware!! Do not buy the SkyBox,"I bought my Skybox less than 3 years ago. It has worked great for that time. But now, it will not cool. I think the compressor went out. I went to the Maytag website and you can't find one sentence regarding the SkyBox nor any information about parts. If you Google MayTag SkyBox, you will get a long list of others having similar problems with it breaking down and difficulty in getting parts and repairing. It looks like Maytag quit selling it, and they won't back up their product anymore.The product was nice for a short time, but it is not worth the money if it breaks down in 3 years and you can't get it fixed."
2,Choose another fridge,At first this fridge was working good for a few months. Then it started to have ice against the back of the fridge. I have to turn it off and leave it open overnight to defrost. It's not as cold as it was in the first few months. It also leaks water. It's not worth to keep having it repaired. One repair cost almost as much as the fridge did.
5,Great Movies Stemmed From Great Books,"The first two of the Harry Potter series are extremely entertaining, imaginitive movies originated from two incredibly well planned, well written novels, and are definitely worth adding to your collection today! I bought them originally on VHS but gave them away when I decided to switch to the DVD and I couldn't be happier. These are some of the few movies (and books) I cannot wait for.The 3rd movie, The Prisoner of Azkaban, is also an excellent movie, though, because of a new director, was filmed differently - and it shows. The scenery has transformed completely, and the storyline does not follow the book as precisely as the first two. Still, amazing nonetheless - the entire series is surely something you'll want to own yourself!"
2,Eh....,See the Images I uploaded above. I have about a million Dover books on various areas including needlework and designs. This is one of the most boring and least useful.
2,Getting Started With Literature Circles,"I was disappointed in the book. I came away with a few parctical suggestions, but a 5 page essay could have given me the gist. The rest of the book was repetitious and superfcial.Having mentioned something important, for instance, lke evaluating the readability of a book, they then simply referred the reader another book. The authors seemed to spend time every chapter stating that how a teacher uses their information will depend a great deal on the teacher and his/her students. Of course it does. Just say it once. It was almost as if they were hedging their bets. Compare this to a literacy book written by Lucy Caulkins and it really seems elementary."
2,The title is misleading. It should be Lupus Q & A a primer,"If you're looking for straight answers and in depth discussion about lupus, look elsewhere.While this book has all sorts of information for people NEW to lupus, it is totally useless for anyone living with lupus, or looking for straight answers about lupus.I got as much information from the Web as I got from this book.This book should be given to friends and families of those that live with lupus, not to the patients themselves. There is no in depth conversation on lab tests. Nothing in the book talks about what to expect from your doctor, what normal and abnormal test results are and what they mean. There is no discussion on when a patient should, or should not press for a better answer or for more testing.""Lupus Q & A, a Primer"" is good information for the uninvolved an uninitiated. As a source of information for a patient, it is totally useless."
3,"Enjoyable, not as predictable as some have said","I enjoyed this book. At first, it started out a little slow and dare I say boring but it all came together and became more interesting as I kept reading. I didn't find it TOO predictable as I've found other novels. A good first effort from Jennifer van der Kwast. I look forward to reading future works from her. Recommended summer reading!"
1,poor copy of Olbas Oil Inhalant Decongestant,"1. You advertisement of the product as Olbas Oil Inhalant Decongestant is misleading.It is actually an Aromatic Inhalant Therapeutic Body Massage.This is a complete different matter. So I feel that I was misled.2.Your ""Olbas Oil"" is the lowest quality I have ever experienced. It barely has a scent to it and it does nothing to for relief of bronchial and nasal congestion and hayfever. It does not either work for symptomatic relief of muscular pain. The latter is what the lable on the bottle reads that it should be used for.I don't think that I will buy from your company ever again in the future, because I cannot trust your adds."
1,not happy with it,"I purchased this iron to replace a sunbeam one that was about 1 year old. After about 2 months It doesn't work any longer! I am very dissatisfied with these items. I purchased them to replace my OLD iron that is 20 years old. The only reason I bought a new one is because I wanted one that had automatic shut off. I guess I can't complain about it's cost as it's been awhile since I had to make a purchase. Needless to say, I am now using the OLD ONE! In my opinion, new technology SUCKS!!"
2,Just another iron...,"This is just another steam iron. I've had mine for almost two years and it has the problems that all steam irons have. It's no longer drip free, although for the first year it was. While it does produce an above average amount of steam, the shot of steam function has isn't limitless and I haven't been able to ""vertically steam"" any hanging garment. I drain the water compartment after every use, yet mysteriously it occasionally leaks. The retractble cord occasionally gets hung up. The small door to the water compartment is fragile and should be treated as such.On the plus side, the iron heats quickly, is stylish and easy to handle.That said, no I won't buy another one."
1,Died After Five Months,"I bought this iron about five months ago and it completely stopped working yesterday. I have no idea why it suddenly broke. I used it about four times a week and was not impressed. Even when it was working, the steam generated was not great. There are much better irons out there for the same price. The best thing about this iron was the retractable cord, but you had to manipulate that to get it to retract fully."
2,"Nice Iron, couple of flaws.","I actually do like the iron, I love the steam shot, but the spray needs to be redone, it never hits my clothes, it always sprays above and beyond my clothes onto the floor. I just don't use that feature. My problem is with the retractable cord, as a previous reviewer stated, you have to wrestle with the cord to get it to fully retract. Well, in doing so, mine broke. I have to hold the cord under my hand now when I'm ironing. Otherwise, it just shoots right back inside the iron. UGHHHH!! That drives me nuts. I guess, it doesn't really pay to try to get a little more fancy with your iron. I'm going back to the good old stand by."
1,Waste of money & energy!,"I bought this iron because a friend had recommended the Sunbeam brand to me. In fact, she has had her Sunbeam for 15+ years. It worked for its intended ironing exactly twice. The third time I was to use it, the iron failed to heat at all and this ""non-leak"" iron leaked all over the floor, the ironing board, and my clothes. I unplugged it and started again thinking it might simply be a glitch. The same thing happened again. And, again. I am returning this excuse for an iron today. Don't make the mistake I did and order this iron!"
1,Dangerous!,"Got this iron 5 years ago for our wedding. So, it has lasted us a good while, I will give it that and always seemed to work fine. However, this morning my wife came out of the bathroom in a panic because our entire closet and bathroom was full of thick smoke. After turning the iron on to let it warm up, she went into the bathroom and then smelled smoke. The iron was going haywire, you could feel the heat of the iron 3 feet away as I approached it. The sides were melting away and it was billowing light gray smoke into the air.Obviously, if this had happened while we were away, there is no doubt in my mind it would have caught our house on fire and killed our two kennelled dogs.Stay away from this iron. I'm reporting the incident to Sunbeam."
1,Twice the fool,"I purchased this iron about 2 years ago because it was advertised as ""NO LEAK"". After intermittent use it started leaking like a sieve. Otherwise I did like the iron. So, like a fool I went out and bought the same iron again thinking this one was just defective. This time, besides leaking again, when I used the steam black water came out all over my clothes. And YES I always used bottled water. I do not iron very frequently but when I do it is usually dress clothes which makes it twice as bad. I will now look for an iron with many good reviews and purchase one of those no matter the cost. I'm never going to just choose one off the store shelf again."
2,buyer beware,"I guess I thought this was a little misleading! I assumed it was four episodes of each show. It's not. It's one episode of each of the four shows.And right on the cover it clearly states ""For promotional use only. Not for sale or transfer to any third party."" Whoops, I guess they didnt read that."
4,"A balanced history of ""orientalism""","This is a rebutal to Edward Said's beselling diatribe against Western based scholarship on the Near East. It is also a balanced and careful history of Western (mainly European)study of Near Eastern languages, history and customs. Where Said grouped together almost every specialization in Middle Eastern studies under the same umbrella, Robert Irwin is careful to give each its proper attention.He points out Said's typical use of over generalization and lack of attention to accuracy and is careful to say that it is not Said's stand on the Arab-Israelie conflict that he has fault with, just his somewhat distorted view of Western scholarship."
2,Switch does not work,"The product arrived in one week. The winch is fine, but the ""switch"" does not work. (does not recieve power and the battery is fine.) We called a dealer rep. repair shop and they sent us a new switch. The problem now is the wires on the new switch are too short, so they have to be spliced. We do Not have this working yet."
4,"OUTLAWZ , MOB LIFEEEEE!!!!","Big Syke's album :be yo self was tight....but Fatals album is the tightest outlawz album i heard so far....but jus recently i pick up Gonzoe's new album...one of the outlawz newest outlawz along with L.S. who's representin o.b.b., he's from the east coast. Even though Fatal dont got no outlawz appearing on his joint..its still hella tyte..an he give up much love to them throughout the entire album. The beats are heavy, an nice, an his lyrics are hella tyte..if you down with the outlawz, pick this joint up!!! Pick up Gonzoe : if i live and nothing happens too, its got tha outlawz, regime members, its hella tyte!! OUTLAW IMMORTALZ 4 life"
4,"THIRD, FORTH BEST OUTLAW?","WE ALL KNOW THAT THE OUTLAWZ, LEAD BY PAC CAN KICK IT WITH THE BEST BUT HOW DO THEY DO ON THEIR OWN? FATAL IS BY KNOW MEANS THE BEST OUTLAW OR THE BEST RAPPER IN THE WORLD BUT HE HAS SKILLS. RANKED IN MY OPPINION BEHIND PAC KADAFI AND NAPOLEAN FATAL IS STILL ONE OF THE BEST RAPPERS AROUND. THE OUTLAWZ ARE THE BEST RAP GROUP IN RECENT HISTORY,SIGNED TO DEATHROW THEY WILL SOON BE RELEASING AN ALBUM WITH PAC FEATURING ON THE CD. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO IT AND IF THIS CD FROM 1998 IS ANYTHING TO GO BY IT SHOULD BE A GOOD ALBUM I WOULD BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU LIKE THE OUTLAWZ STYLE OR YOU HAVE BEEN INPRESSED BY HUSSEIN HIMSELF. THROUGOUT THE WORLD OF RAP THIS ALBUM HAS RECEIVED LITTLE RECOGNISITION BUT I STILL THINK IT IT A VERY GOOD ALBUM AND SHOWS WHAT RAP IS ABOUT. THE TRACKS THAT STAND OUT WITH ME ARE EVERYDAY AND M.O.B. EVERYDAY HAS TO BE THE BEST TRACK ON THE ALBUM, IT IS A TRUIBUTE TO THE LATE TUPAC SHAKUR, IT IS A VREY GOOD RAP CONBINED WITH A FAT BEAT. BUY THIS ALBUM."
5,This is the best thug in da business behind pac,This is tight work by FATAL he is a OUTLAW for life get dis C
5,Fatal the only solo rapper that made a fantastic cd,"I'm starting to like Fatal when he was with the Outlawz Immortal and with Tupac Shakur(the best rap singer of ever)and all i can say is that his style,if you know it,is very recognizable. All i can say is to buy this album....you'll never be disappointed."
3,off putting at some times but Robin Tunney is excellent,"Robin Tunney(The Craft, End Of Days) plays a quirky chatter box who is being stalked by a man. She goes to a invited party only where she has a good time with the man she likes played by Jason Priestley(Calendar Girl, Love and Death On Long Island). The stalker played by Brad Hunt makes her run over a cop and she is inlisted into a place where she wears a tracking device around her ankle. Tim Blake Nelson(Minority Report, O Brother Where Are Thou) plays the cop who looks after her. Determined to get out she tries many possible things. Cherish is a inventive dark comedy with some offbeat moments but delivers some funny things. the wheelchair guy is funny and so is the part where Tim Blake Nelson is trying to do Yoga and his instructer is Phil LaMarr from MAD TV. also starring singer Liz Phair"
5,I simply love this movie!,"Mostly because of Robin Tunney. She really brought the character Zoe to life. She was so good at playng the way Zoe changed during the movie. I watch it most every day if I have time.She is stunningly beautiful, cute and sexy in it. (and in real life too) I have the VHS and plan to buy the DVD later (i wish it was double layer.) Buy this movie. You will watch it over and over. Some bad language was the reason for the R rating. Maybe they should re-release it in a PG-13 so younger people can enjoy it."
3,Good Idea...Awkward Execution,Hitchcock or DePalma could have done more with this. A drunk slacker girl is carjacked and gets arrested after he kills a cop then flees from her car. We see her on house arrest for the next hour or so and little happens. The killer and probation officer are never very well developed. The fun 1980's soundtrack often undermines the suspense of the material. It's all on the level of a tv movie.
4,Cherish,"The editorial reviews summarize this movie well-except to include the fact that this is an original idea for a movie that plays out very well. The story is quite unusual, unpredictable & can make a person want to watch it again to grasp at all the interesting ways the film is presented. If you liked this you might also like ""Human Traffic"" and/or ""Floundering""."
2,Andersen Op. 63 for Flute,"Seller sent Op. 33, although the add said Op. 63. But no problem in getting the refund."
3,"good anatomical reference, limited treatment techniques","A little disappointed in this book. Excellent anatomy reference but lacks biomechanical explanations as they pertain to whole movement or what happens with dysfunction. More a reference for the vet student than for practical application of physical therapy techniques. Jim Mastersons book ""Beyond Horse Massage"" is much better for treatment techniques."
4,Great yogurt maker,"I got this as a Christmas gift and so far, so good! I had read other reviews and quite a few mentioned how hard the bottles are to clean. I have found a solution: use a baby bottle cleaner!! I just so happened to have one on hand and my jars were not problem at all to clean! Yay! Happy Yogurt Making!! :)"
5,Good Basic Yogurt Maker,"We bought this unit a few weeks back, and have made about a half-dozen batches, all turned out great! We have used both specifically made yogurt starter, as well as plain yogurt, both methods produce great results!"
5,Great Product,"This is my first time using a yogurt machine and it was so easy to use I couldn't believe it. The instructions were simple to follow and the yogurt was perfect from the first batch; even better than what I use to buy from the store. I use the machine at least twice a week and will never buy yogurt from the store again, unless it's to use as a starter. This is the best kitchen appliance I have purchased in a long time."
5,"Smooth, creamy yogurt that is FRESH!!","The reason why I purchased a yogurt maker to begin with was due to reading the book, ""Why French Women Don't Get Fat."" She said to get a yogurt maker and talked about how good yogurt is for us. I searched on line for a yogurt maker and stumbled across the Deni Yogurt Maker on Amazon. The first try was even the freshest yogurt I have ever had in my life. The second was even better. I boiled the milk, let it stand until room temperature, then mixed the yogurt culture and milk together with a whisk in a pitcher and added it equally to each indiviudal jar. I set it on 12 hours the first try and 10 on the second. I actually think the second was better. The yogurt is so creamy and fresh after putting in the refrigerator for a few hours. Very easy clean up and well worth the purchase!!"
3,could use better jars,"The maker itself works well enough, but the jar lids don't attach very well, and the necks are kind of narrow for eating out of."
4,This works and it's simple to use,"I just finished our first batch of home-made yogurt. At first, I wasn't sure about making yogurt by myself. But this yogurt maker makes things a lot easy and manageable. It's easy to clean and easy to use. Just follow the instructions. I will definitely recommend. The six small jars make storage reasonable. Everyday a fresh jar of home-made yogurt!"
4,Great Buy For The Money,"I absolutely love this produce and have enjoyed using it weekly since I purchased it a month ago. I have to agree with others when they noted the jars are difficult to wash; and, it would have been nice if the directions included, at the very least, a basic yogurt recipe. Other than that, I would recommend it to anyone. I am actually thinking about purchasing another - one that has a quart container."
2,"Works, but with some caveats.","Didn't work using 1% milk and organic yogurt starter (yes, it had live cultures) even after 10 hours. Got to be sure the boiled milk is cool. Even with whole milk it took 10 hours to make. There is no timer on mine. The knob has no connection whatsoever to any sort of internal device, but the knob can't be removed to see why. Freewheeling. Funny that some said the alarm was loud. Are you sure there actually is one? Lucky I have a timer on our nearby electric range"
3,yoghurt maker,"I would prefer making yoghurt into one larger container rather than several small jars. Other than that, it worked fine."
3,good starter,"It took a couple of attempts, but once you get the hang of, it is easy to use. The alarm is pretty piercing and I am not sure it automatically turns off the maker; so unless you want to wake up to the incessant alarm or otherwise leave it unattended, time accordingly. The irregular shape really only holds the glass jars that come with the maker. I have been able to squeeze some other larger jars in the maker, but the odd shape prevents you from using most other jars. Like other reviewers said, the accompanying jars have tops that don't really stay on and the shape of the jars isn't the easiest to clean."
1,Don't buy this brand,"I owned Salton yogurt makers for over 30 years, and when the last one died, I found out Salton no longer makes them. So, I purchased this model. First off, the description says the jars hold 6 ounces of yogurt. No way! If you follow the recipe and heat 1 quart of milk, and add the 1/2 cup of live culture yogurt, you are left with almost 3/4 cup that won't fit in the jars! The tiny jars are more like baby food jars, and not only do they not hold 6 ounces, the tiny opening and lip on the inside make them hard to eat out of and clean. As a side note, in the 30 years I have been making yogurt I have never added any more than 2 heaping tablespoons of yogurt and always got perfect results."
3,Small neck jars,"The instructions were easy to read, the unit worked perfectly, and the yogurt was just the right taste and texture. The jars not so much. The 6 oz. jars have necks slightly narrower than the jars, making it difficult to scrape the yogurt out and hampering essential cleanup afterward. They're also a little on the thin side making them impractical for packing for lunch."
2,good watch but,Love the watch but the expansion band is way too tight. I'm not a big person and the band is hardly expanded on my wrist but the band is so strong that it cuts into my skin. The watch I ordered had a clasp type band but they sent me one with an expansion band. Guess I should have sent it back but thought the band might loosen up some. Wrong.
5,Good thing that CDs don't wear out!,"This is one of my all time favorite soundtracks. Each time I put the CD in, I am wowed with the ""movie recall"" I have--sensing the same things I do as I watch the film."
5,Blessed Doodles Is Blessed,"I find Blessed Doodles to have great technical ability, great variety, and a soulful expression which seems to be saying that we must reconsider our lives and value the things that really matter.Jimbeau Walsh pulls out all the stops to make this CD a treasure."
3,This release is OK.... just OK.,"This SHOULD have been a great CD but when I listened to it I was very disappointed to find that the incredibly beautiful opening flute theme (from the movie Baraka) is omitted as well as other great material from the movie (i.e. the jewish chanting/singing part). Also, some songs like the conga-based ""African Journey"" and ""Rainbow Voice"" are severely truncated versions from the movie.... which is a shame."
1,Disappointed Baraka lover,"I love the movie...I own it; watch it a lot. The CD does NOT have all the music soundtrack included, nor is it mixed the same as the music is in the movie. Seriously disappointed."
2,Disappointing quality,"Needed a new manifold for my jeep. This one arrived from Amazon - the price was better than most places. Product was made in China. Sand casting was poor, there was a large defect in the outside, appears to be from extra sand / material in the mold. The biggest problem was when I went to fit it. There was excess material on one of the flanges, that required extensive grinding to get the two manifolds to fit together! Next, I could not get one of the inside studs to thread, and discovered more excess flashing in a cavity where a bolt should pass, preventing the bolt from making it to the head. Machine surface was flat, did include a gasket to go between the two manifolds. Plugs in the air injection holes were not more than finger tight. Product worked otherwise, just poor quality control on the part of the manufacturer."
4,Everyday Pen,"I have several fountain pens including Cross and Parker, but this pen is my everyday pen. It uses larger cartridges and starts easier than the Cross. It has nice weight and balance and writes smoothly on a variety paper. The Phileas is a good first fountain pen and is not so expensive that you will worry about carrying it around. Plus it is a nice looking pen."
5,Thanks,"Great quality! And great price, on time, brother loved them! He got the whole ensemble, made Christmas great! Good product"
3,"Very ""Slick""",The gloves are very light weight which is what I wanted for bow hunting in warmer weather. However they are extreamly slick and make it hard to grip things (such as a Bow) and I find it difficult and inconvinient to use them.
3,Not As Pictured!!!!,"The gloves were the thin slick camo material. They fit nice and would be easy to use with a gun or bow and release or a recurve. However, they DO NOT have the black grip on them (as pictured). I was dissapointed in this since, that is the reason I bought them (the grip). However, if you are not concerned with the grip feature, these are the right gloves for you. I would not expect them to keep my hands warm but it will definately work well for a release or gun and to camo your hands."
5,Rolling pin,"The pin arrived more quickly than I had expected. It has no perceptible metal taint, is sturdy and lightweight."
5,Pop Purr-fection,"this is an awesome album...I never got the first album, but this cd always puts me in a good mood whenever I go out clubbing, it's sexy, seductive and everything you could want embodied in a pop star, too bad they gave up on this collection after just one single...this was supposed to be Holly's breakthrow in my opinion."
4,great 80's are back,"This album hasn't had very good sales at all, although general reviews were quite positive, in the uk she started off quite well with her first album, but people didn't warm to her and i guess sales flagged. However this album is full of dancy little numbers that sound quite 80's basics but with still a modern feel. Maybe not the best voice, but the songs chosen/written were done very well and it is hard not to like this album."
4,Holly Who?,"I have never heard of Holly Valance, of course until I decided to do my own investigation. I really dig music popular down under or in the UK so that's when I found out about Holly! I didn't know what to expect, but since she's the pop/dance genre, I thought I'd go for it! Well, I was more than pleased. This album is great! the songs and beats are so cool, and her voice is so sweet and sexy! I can't explain how glad I am to have bought this album.If I had to describe it I would say its dance pop meets electric/rock. Really good album. I haven't even listened to the cd many times yet, so I'm sure my rating of four stars will go up to 5! You won't regret buying this cd. And don't compare it to her first. From what I've heard its different.Get familiar with HOLLY VALANCE!"
3,Better The Second Time,"I must admit, I thought Holly Valance's first album was horrible. But a friend convinced me to give this sophmore effort a chance. I was pleasantly surprised. State Of Mind is a very decent pop album. All the required elements are there: catchy hooks, good production, plenty of beats. The standout tracks are the title track, Desire, with it's heavy rock guitar, Curious and Roll Over are also good, but I think Action is the big winner. It has that little 4-note bit at the beginning and throughout that grabs you immediately. Make no mistake, Holly is a knockoff of Kylie and Dannii, but State Of Mind has enough selling points to find it's place among the pop contingency. My friend says, if you liked Kylie's Fever, you'll like Holly's State of Mind. I agree.P.S. It's a good recommendation to those who don't like Body Language."
3,Can't always get what you want.,"The price was cheaper on line for this type of umbrella, but we did have problems with the quality of this umbrella. It was very disappointing. Had issues almost right away (within the first week) with the umbrella and the string mechanism and they were unable to replace it. I would try to purchase local, even if it cost more cause then I could return it and or exchange it without all the headache and wallet ache the umbrella was."
4,Closer to the mark than some,"Writing about Alaska is harder than you'd think. The physical beauty can be both overwhelming and subtle to nth degree of white or gray. But the people whose traditions have bound them to the land and those who choose to live here are not always described well.I think Gerri Brightwell made a good start. She caught the strength of those who have been raised here and their ability to survive. She describes cabin life with feeling and is not exaggerating the constant danger of living in the deep cold. She touched upon the interdependence of Alaskan families; in this story there are negative impacts, while I witness far more positive and necessary mutual support.So, as a start, it begins to bring an image of Alaska to the foreground. Outside of Alaska as the setting, her prose is clean, the story line very believable, and offers satisfying growth in the characters. That alone makes the story worth reading."
1,don't buy this book,"This book is riddled with grammatical and spelling errors, and contains virtually no useful information. I am a first year MBA student, and found this book utterly useless and a waste of money. The book jacket should mention the fact that the ""12 steps"" only apply to marketing a product and not a service. Anything written by Roman Heibing is light-years more intelligent and informational."
2,"fragmented information, no help on writing a Marketing plan","The book gives basic suggestions on the individual parts of a plan, but then falls apart when it should tell you how to put those peices together (it says nothing - absolutely zero - on how to put the parts into a presentation. I wouldn't get this book if I were you."
3,Musicmatch - Good book,"Good book to have. Provides good background information on the technical aspects of the music downloading, cd burning process."
5,A Great Resource,"The ultimate guide to Detroit. This book presents the city and surrounding suburbs as only a native Detroiter could. Lots of facts and figures, accompanied by wonderful photographs.Do you know the origin of 8-mile road? Do you know why Ft. Wayne was built? Do you know the history of ""The Big Tire?"" Do you know Detroit's wealthiest neighborhood? Do you know which buildings Albert Kahn designed?This book is excellent if you are entertaining out of town guests and would like to share some interesting stories about Detroit."
2,The Detroit Almanac,"A reliable reference book should be rigorously edited, and this one wasn't. Its typography is sloppy, with odd paragraph breaks, and it has misspelled words (""ediface"" for ""edifice"" is one). Nicknames replace real ones. One photo shows up twice with two different captions; another, of the '60s band MC5, is backwards. And this is the second edition. However, if you're still going to spend.... for it, be sure your copy has the blush-red triangle in the corner that says ""Includes Index!"" The first edition apparently forgot it. Nine people claim to have copy-edited this book. They should deny it."
1,Big Disappointment,I normally love Belva Plain's writing. Once I start one of her books I find it hard to put down and am usually sorry when I am finished. I read about 1/3 of this book and decided it wasn't worth finishing. It was just too silly and unbelievable for me. Come on Belva you can do better.
2,Not her best,"I usually enjoy Belva Plain's books, but ""Her Father's House"" was disappointing. It started out interesting, but I found myself skimming chapters in the middle just to get through the book. The ending could have been dramatic, but was boring."
4,A good storyteller,"You can count on a Belva Plain novel to tell a good story, and this book is no exception. The main character is Donald Wolfe, a young man who lives prudently and plans his life carefully. His world is turned upside-down when he meets the enchanting Lillian. They marry, and Donald finds out that Lillian is not all she appeared to be when they were dating. Donald begins to wonder if he has made a terrible mistake in his marriage, when Lillian announces that she is pregnant. Their child, Bettina, is enchanting, and Donald feels more and more drawn to her despite the fact that his marriage to her mother has fallen apart. Events occur which cause Donald to make a decision which will effect the rest of his, Lillian's and Bettina's lives. He becomes a fugitive, afraid that someday, somewhere, he will be confronted with his crime. Plain develops characters which the reader can really care about, and writes an interesting story of redemption and forgiveness."
5,Very Good Quick Read,"This is about a lawyer who married badly, got divorced in two years while the wife was pregnant. The mother was never home and often had adulterous affairs. The husband kidnapped the daughter when she was two and took on a new identity, moved to Georgia and lived with a woman on her farm he had met on a plane once that invited him to come by if he was ever in town. His daughter eventually found out about her old identity. I liked this book and would recommend it."
5,GO GET THIS BOOK,This is one of the GREATEST books Ive EVER READ! It didnt make me cry BUT as a man I'm not ashamed to admit that my eyes got a little watery while reading this book. . . . Just a little. I repeat GREATEST BOOK EVER! I might read it again.
2,Not for those looking for comfort as a suicide survivor,"I have not a doubt that Ms.Browne has a psychic gift but, I do feel that if you read a great many other books by different pychics you will be comforted and reassured that a loved one lost to suicide will be forgiven in the life hereafter.Ms. Browne takes a vague and different view that is not the case.Yet she does talk about a devine power of love and forgiveness that doesn't fit in with her thoughts on the victims of suicide.Some how I feel this area is not her expertise and that this particular book should be skipped by anyone looking fo reassurance that their loved one has been welcomed with open arms to the life hereafter. As I stated before I do indeed feel that Ms. Browne is gifted with the psychic ablility but, I think the comdemnation of suicide victims is contrary to everything else she writes."
3,ghostly,"Although, I do believe in life after death, this book was a reiteration of other books I've read on this subject. It really wasn't anything new or refreshing. It lack a soul (no pun intended). This wasn't, When dreams may come."
3,Not much new to read is offered.,"I found the author's interpretation of life after death interesting. However, the author's offers little support as to how she has come to these conclusions of life after death. She minimally describes her ""gift"" and how it explains her view of the life hereafter. The book is quick to read, but I've found others more worth reading. Pay particular attention to the sections on Sir William and Lawrence. I found it confusing and needed to reread these sections."
4,The Real Deal,"This title best makes sense when reading Mary T. Browne's other two books, which are now out of print. I went to see her several years ago, and before I had even sat down, Ms. Browne told me several facts about my life that nobody else knew, and that she had no way of finding out. She also made several predictions and observations about events to come that have since come true. She does not promote herself, and often works with the terminally ill, helping them and their families prepare for crossing over. I would consider any information she gives in her books to be valid and worth thinking about."
2,good but not for everybody,Although several of the jokes were hilarious many were gross or tasteless or both. I thought it was a creative idea and would be interested to know how many people wrote and told him they think they contributed to the book!
1,"NO NO NO. Old, bad ""jokes"" you've either heard already or dont need to hear""","First, this book is from 1986. The picture of the author in his cab shows the NYC taxi fare starts at $1.10 and is 10 cents for add'l 1/9 mile.So the jokes are all old. Almost none of them are even remotely funny. The long ones are all written in a really outdated way.Here is a sampling of the short ""jokes"":""I was in a bathroom and saw on the wall 'Dyslexics of the world untie!""'and ""Q: Did you hear about the restaurant on the moon? A:Great food but NO atmosphere!"" (maybe if this book came with an automatic ""badum-ching"" machine it would be worth it.)and:""Q: Why did God create Gentiles? A: SOMEONE has to buy retail""Seriously. DO NOT buy this crap."
3,As advertised.,"I bought these to wear under a brace needed while recovering from an Achilles tendon injury. They were fine for the purpose and might be appropriate for athletics as well. They are rough rather than fine. Not a criticism, just an observation."
5,An instant favorite!,"We LOVE this book. Our 18 month old daughter has hundreds of books, but this one instantly became a bedtime favorite.The illustrations are whimsical, vibrant and fun... the rhymes are fluid and rich... the story is original yet timeless.As a naturalist, I was particularly excited that all of the information is accurate. It's frustrating when kids books are ""dumbed down"" or full of scientific errors.I highly recommend this book- from toddlers and/or parents who appreciate and marvel at nature to folks who just enjoy a well told story with pretty pictures. This one's sure to please."
5,Diamond in the Rough,"I just saw the movie the other day, and honestly, I thought the movie was pretty cheesy. But, oh my god, the music.The only reason I endured through this 2.5 hour sci-fi hunk of cheddar was to hear what the ending would be like. I'm glad I finally reached it, because the music was superb as I expected.Where hearts were entertained in June..."
3,Rousing and beautiful,"Michael Kamen has provided a lofty score for the movie Brazil. The seriousness of the music forces you to pay attention and take to seriously a movie that otherwise seems preposterous. As mentioned by the other reviewers the different renditions of the title song are rousing and beautiful. The soundtrack is unoriginal and Kamen deserves credit more for arranging the music rather than composing it. The music is variations on 'Brazil' made popular by Xavier Cugat. Also as mentioned before, the inclusion of dialog from the movie is distracting and in my opinion, pointless. I can not recommend the movie."
3,Lohengrin und Lozenges,"Although this set is worth the money for the Wagner collector, it is hardly the first Lohengrin that one should acquire. While the singing is first-rate throughout, the sound is simply not very good, and the incessant hacking from the audience (from Bayreuth, of all places) is extremely irritating. There is also a hefty amount of background noise from the performers.You may ask: what's right with it? Quite a bit, in fact. The vocalists are all excellent, and Sawallisch's conducting is perfect for Lohengrin. The packaging is appealing; there's an available libretto via CD-rom. Lastly, the price is very reasonable. Considering the above complaints, though, now you know why."
4,"Not what I was expecting, but still good","This is a collection of short (horror) stories that do not really seem to be connected to Bram Stoker's Dracula novel, or to each other. Nevertheless, it was still an enjoyable read."
3,It's ok,This collection of stories was enjoyable to read but it was a little hard to follow some of them. It is worth a read but nowhere close to being as good as Dracula.
3,real transylvanian,just a lot of short stories; not even connected in any way but a good read anyway;I was expecting a longer story; short stories are ok for a quick read
3,As always Amazon's delivery OUTSTANDING!,"Dracula's Guest is the short story that would have been the perfect Preface to Dracula....but only Draculas's Guest. The other short stories, meh, nothing that remotely compares to Dracula and the chilling writing of that classic."
3,Never read anything of his other than Dracula,"I had never read anything else written by Bram Stoker other than ""Dracula"", so I didn't really know what to expect. This collection of short stories includes a chapter that was cut from ""Dracula"" and is an interesting addition. The other stories vary from supernatural to thriller, so it's a nice mix. Most of them are what I consider character studies. The stories are a bit predictable to us, but I'm sure they were quite original 100 years ago. Some of the endings seem rushed, as if he got tired of the story, but overall it was a good read."
3,"Not the Masterpiece DRACULA is, but Interesting","Too many TWILIGHT ZONE endings for my taste: when you can predict them, the writing gets tedious & boring. Still, interesting to see this side of the master of horror who created the vampire story all contemporary writers strive, unsuccessfully, to emulate. Good writing."
3,Interesting insight Into Dickens' mind,Heavy read but worth it if you're looking for more than a story. Tells a lot about the times and Dickens' reaction to them.
1,Don't believe the lies.....,"Everything Harold says about Darwin in this so called auto-biography is a lie. I was a member of eckankar for six years and what Harold said about Darwin just didn't make sense. I came across a Darwin website and read his side of what really happened and I quit Eckankar IMMEDIATLY! I know follow Darwins path, ATOM, and I like it MUCH better. Darwin is NOT a fallen master! Instead, Harold is the psuedo master. [...]"
5,Another masterpiece!,"Once again, Jamie Langston Turner has written a novel that I was able to totally lose myself in....wishing it never to be over! I realize that some people complain about how ""wordy"" her novels are, but in my opinion that is part of their appeal. I love getting to know the characters so well. I also love the way characters from earlier books pop up throughout the story. 'If you have enjoyed any of her previous novels, you will like this one! I would be hard pressed to pick a favorite out of them all."
2,Better luck next time!,"Jamie Langston Turner has been one of my favorite authors for years, but this book was a major disappointment. While it starts out mildly enjoyable, it soon becomes almost painful to make it through to the nauseating ending. If you enjoy extremely sappy romances, then this book is for you; if not, save your money. Hopefully we can expect better from Ms. Turner in the future, more along the lines of her first books."
3,Elfago Baca and the Swamp Fox,I was disappointed that there are only 3 episodes of the swamp fox on this set. I was thinking that they were all on there so they really leave you hanging. I wish they had done a set of just the Swamp fox. Maybe some day they will.
2,"Too Little, Too Late","I, too, wish I had read more reviews before buying the set. Although the interview with Loggia was great (I remember him fondly as ex-cat burglar Thomas Hewitt Everett Cat from the old one-season 'T.H.E. Cat' series that played at 9:30 on NBC Fridays long ago...I think U.N.C.L.E. was playing afterwards, but I could be wrong about that...it might have been the season Star Trek played at 10), the number of episodes of the two shows was VERY disappointing.If Disney can give us an entire 17 hours of Spin and Marty, what's with three episodes each of these two? This is not a good value for $35. Most full seasons of 25 episodes of most TV shows are in this same price range.Don't forget, Disney, you're talking TV shows here...ones that you're rerun on your own channels. (Unfortunately, when I didn't have access to the network.) Asking $35 for six episodes is VERY steep.I wouldn't buy another set if they issued another with more episodes. Too pricy.bob"
2,AUGH!!!!,"So Close, and yet so far. I have been watching Swamp Fox since I was a kid. Unfortunately, one horrible night, I accidently hit the record button when the tape my dad had it on was in the VCR. We lost 2 and a half epidodes!!!!!! Maybe 1 and a half, but all the same, I have always grieved the loss. Anyhow, My little bro saw this in the store and started dancing. Much to my dismay, however, when I investigate it, I find not only not all the episodes, but they are out of order!!!!!!! How could this happen?As for Elfego... He is great too. My dad also had him on recordings, and we watched him all the time. So this was a doubly pleasant surprise.... until I read the details. ONLY 3 BLOOMIN EPISODES????? You have got to be kidding me!! And they are out of order as well. Disney, You were so close to getting $30 of my money, and you just lost it...."
2,This is NOT the entire series.,"Both Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox were enjoyable and I would rate a 4 out of 5, but the problem with this set is that we are only given 3 out of 10 Elfego Baca episodes and only 3 out of 8 Swamp Fox episodes. I thought I was getting all the episodes of both series. What a disappointment!"
2,MORE SWAMP FOX NEEDED,"I would have liked to give this more stars because Swamp Fox is a classic, but there are only three episodes each of Swamp Fox and Elfego Baca. I should have read these reviews first but in my excitement at seeing the boxed set in the store, bought it, and opened it. UH OH.... Too Bad. What were they thinking? My children brought the episodes to school while the class was reading about General Marion and they enjoyed it. Leslie Nielsen's performance is great and any Avenger's fans will enjoy seeing a young Patrick MacNee. For some reason, I have not been able to remove the English close captioning, even when I select none on the set up."
3,Where are the rest?,"Like everyone else I would like to see Disney put out The Swamp Fox and Elfago Baca as complete sets. I would also like to see Texas John Slaughter and Tonka. I watched these on TV with my sister when we were kids and would like to own them on DVD. Why does Disney have to be so hard headed? Obviously Disney doesn't care about us Baby Boomers. It's to bad Walt's not here anymore, he would put these sets out for us. Walt knew how to please his customers."
2,Does seem a bit much for six episodes,"I recall the Swamp Fox being pretty good but Efega Bacca being fairly routine. And when are they going to release Dr Syn, Alias the Scarecrow aka The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh??? I'd pay the price for that three episode set!"
2,Hurry!!!!! Boomers want this now!!!!,"Why cant you put the whole series together, i feel ripped off. Baby boomers want this now, reliving the past was never so difficult, when and if you complete this set, those of us who already bought this set should be compensated. soon we will be gone and noone will remember this stuff, i want to pass this on to my grandchildren. experience it with them so they can have memories too. start bringing out those old live world of disney shows!!! i hope to see ""sammy the way out seal"" before i die."
1,Swamp Fox....dissapointed!,"I too, feel somewhat strange about writing a review on a movie I have not purchased. I was going to order Swamp Fox, but after reading everyone else's comment on how it only contains three of the eight episodes, I have decided NOT to buy it. I hope Disney gets the message!"
1,The Ol' Bait and Switch Scam,"I am truely grateful for this feedback forum! One has to read very carefully to ascertain that this DVD only contains a FEW of these two fine series. AND at such a price! I concur with many others that for the price, I expected to receive BOTH series - COMPLETE. It seems that Disney offered one thing and delivered another! The ol' bait and switch scam!"
1,WANTED: SWAMP FOX DVD SET: WHOLE!!!!!!!,"MY HUSBAND AND I WERE ALL SET TO BUY THIS FOR CHRISTMAS FOR OUR 2 BOYS BUT I READ THE REVIEWS AND I KNOW I WOULD NOT BUY IT UNLESS THE ENTIRE COLLECTION WAS OFFERED. HURRY, DISNEY, AND RELEASE ALL EPISODES IN ONE SET!!!!!!!!"
1,Why is Disney screwing up its DVD releases?,"This dvd set is pure highway robbery. If this is true and there are only 3 episodes of each...for a typical retail price of 29.99 (because of that insidious tin can case possibly). The DVD format can hold much more than 3 episodes. This isn't video tape fellas.Just think about this for a minute...that would be the equivalent of say 6 episodes of (your favorite tv series here) per dvd set for the same price you were paying for a full season of the tv show. Would you buy that? Would you buy a full price dvd set 3 or 4 times to complete one season?Please don't order this. Steer clear and stop encouraging this madness.Now Disney, if you ever get your act together after no one buys your dvds....please release Elfego Baca, Swamp Fox, Texas John Slaughter, Andy Burnett, The Living Desert and all of the ""true-life adventures"" on dvd. Each with its own dvd set is fine.And you can even keep that dumb tin can. Just do it completely instead of cheap and extortionate.."
1,"Shows are great, but where are the rest?","These are old Disney shows from 2 series. I saw them on the late-night ""Vault Disney"" series. They were well done and interesting. The only problem is that this DVD is only a few (6 total) of the 18 shows. So although I would rate the shows as a 4 or 5, this release gets 1 star for being incomplete.Save your money for if and when the whole series comes out."
5,Cheated,The videos were good. Picture and sound were great just like I was watching them when they first came out. But I was disappointed that they were not a complete set. I wish Disney would have issued the whole set it left me wamting to see the rest of the collections. But overall good DVD's just pricey for a partial set.
4,Wish it were more,I enjoyed the teaser. I would like to see the entire series released. The Swamp Fox was a favorite when I was young.
1,"Shame on you, Disney","I ordered this DVD 2 days ago and then read the reviews here. Needless to say, I've canceled my order (thankfully it hadn't shipped yet). I don't understand Disney at all. Why put out such garbage as this edited collection, when it would be just as simple to put out a DVD with all the episodes? The marketing people at Disney need to go back to school, because (at the least the DVD group) doesn't get it at all."
1,Swamped by Swamp FoxDisney,Thank you for the previous reviews. I will not buy this set as is. I'll wait until disney does the right thing.
1,Not buying it,"Maybe this is not fair, to write a review without even seeing the DVD. I wanted to make sure Disney understands that people do read these reviews, and I am not buying this DVD, as Swamp Fox is incomplete! Three out of Eight episodes is hardly a reason to purchase!"
1,Disney needs to fire the DVD guy,Good grief - yet another DVD collection we are not buying because Disney doesn't seem to understand. We LOVED these series when they were on television but we will not buy something that is slapped together and incomplete. I hope the folks at Disney get the message eventually. Same thing applies to their live action feature films. Disney should release them in widescreen with some extras or not bother. Too bad because we have all the animated films and would happily buy the live action if the same care was given to the production.
1,only part of the story..,"I agree with most of the reviewers that it was bad form on the part of Disney to only release 3 episodes from these series--fans of either show are left unsatisfied (I wanted the set for Swamp Fox). Surely Disney could have fit all the available episodes on two disks? Noone should buy this! The only thing Disney seems to understand anymore is the bottom line. If desperate fans buy it, Disney won't provide the quality releases we're all hoping for. Buying this is like buying half a movie! I've been hoping Disney will release the original black and white Zorro series on DVD, but not if they're going to do this..."
1,I refuse to buy this set,"as a protest.Iwas quite excited to learn the Swamp Fox was being released on DVD, as this was my favorite Disney series...that is , until I find there are only three episodes in the set. I will not spend my money on a partial offering.If and when they present us with the entire Swamp Fox series, then I will invest in a copy."
5,movie dvd,Going to Amazon sure beats going to any local stores. I can wait a few days for the good prices.
4,Princess Shy,"This production of Once Upon a Mattress makes you wonder why Tracey Ullman hasn't been on Broadway until now. She makes the show, in spite of the fact that the role is for a younger woman. For that matter, why aren't there more musical roles for women over forty? The only one I can think of is Mamma Mia. Judging by the popularity of Mamma Mia, it seems as if there is a considerable audience for such shows.The DVD version of Once Upon a Mattress is fun to watch, but I can't help thinking that I might have been disappointed if I'd paid Broadway prices for a ticket. The only memorable number in the show was Ullman's opening tune ""I'm Shy."" On the other hand, the DVD includes a few extra features that you may enjoy. There's a short about the 1959 production that starred Carol Burnett as Princess Winifred, as well as two split-screen musical numbers comparing the rehearsals with the full-dress version."
2,What Happened to When Daddy Wore His Very Soft Shoes!!!,A great disappointment - with Ms Burnett at the helm I had hoped for more - a lot more! But woe is me! Where was the minstrel? Where was the Jester's lovely tribute to his Dad - Where was Joe Layton's choreography? I danced in this for the Pennsylvania Players as the lead male dancer and it was one of the highlights of my life. I saw Ms Burnett on Broadway when I first fell in love with her and this show. I am glad to have somewhat of a record of the show - but I really miss the numbers that were cut and the original choreo for the Spanish Panic! I thought with Ms Burnett at the helm this would be terrific - it was not!
1,dated and boring,Can't understand why many others are raving over this film.It is so terrribly dated and the songs are forgettable-not good in a musical.The Queen's male assistant is so queeny himself that his performance is embarrassing.
1,Disappointed,"I love Carol Burnett,Tracey Ulmann, and this traditional fairy tale and was anxious to see this performance. However, I was very disappointed that Disney chose the storyline with Lady Larken and Sir Harry. Lady Larken and Sir Harry the Immaculate are not married and are expecting a baby and therefore are ""the reason"" the princess from the swamp is brought to the kingdom. Some princess....ANY PRINCESS.... MUST marry the Prince before Lady Larken's baby is born because she cannot marry until the Prince marries and she is starting to ""show"" her pregnancy. Disney suggests that teenage pregnancy is ""ok"" and even virtuous. Shame on you!!! Why did this storyline have to be inserted into a wonderful fairy tale. You ruined a very wonderful production with tacky trash! Why???"
3,WHY IS TRACEY ULLMAN TRYING TO RUIN HER CAREER,"WHY IS TRACEY ULLMAN TRYING TO RUIN HER CAREER?(after seeing the 2005 version of Once Upon a Mattress)Tracey's over forty nowAnd she looks just like a cowWatch her leg: it lumbers highWhen she turns, she's like to dieWhen she squirms upon her bedShe no longer turns your head(Except perhaps to turn away).This little lilting roundelay's for Tracey of the years way backBut Tracey's gone awa', alack."
4,Carol Burnette - both sides now!,"I remember seeing this on TV years ago when TV was often live. Carol played Princess Fred then, and I am looking forward to seeing what she does as the Queen. The score is wonderful. One of the best is ""I'm in Love With a Girl Named Fred."" This version should be pretty good."
4,Once Upon a Mattress is great!,I really loved Once Upon a Mattress. That's why I bought it in the first place. Carol Burnett was fantastic.
2,It hurt my soul!,"Although the acting was good, the whole film seemed so juvenile... like it was meant for little kids and the filmmakers didn't care to make it superb enough for everyone, letting the extra thing that makes a film exquisite slide. However, I might just be disappointed because the musical- not the movie- is my favorite broadway musical on earth (so far). Also, I like Winnifred as a blonde- Sarah Jessica Parker was just too amazing!"
4,"Great fun, worthy remake","Carol Bernett is terrific, and Tracy Ullman steals the show. (If the star can be said to steal a show.) Not my favorite musical ever, but this is a great reworking of it. The set and costumes are georgeous. (Those who have a problem with the pregnancy subplot may be urged to consider getting a life -- unfortunately, that's one of the few items not available for sale on Amazon.com)"
2,little dissapointed,"i love the cast of characters, but I was dissappointed to find out that the movie was so different from the original script."
4,"Cute Musical Based On One Of My Favorite Fairytales, The Princess and the Pea.","Once Upon a Mattress is based on the fairytale The Princess and the Pea which is one of my favorite fairy tales. I have never seen the original version of Once Upon a Mattress in which Carol Burnett played Princess Winnifred (Fred) but I saw this remake on ABC tonight and I liked it and found it very entertaining and cute! In this new version Carol Burnett played Queen Aggrivain and Tracey Ullman played Fred and I thought they were both great and I liked the rest of the cast too, especially Tommy Smothers as the King, and I also liked the guy who played Prince Dauntless. I recorded this on to DVD using my DVD recorder but unfortunately we get lousy cable reception and it didn't come out too good so I'm happy that it is coming out on DVD on Tuesday and I will definitely think of buying it."
2,ONCE UPON A MATRESS - DVD,"Once Upon a MattressVery focussed on making Carol Burnett (The Queen) the star, when the PRINCESS is the star of the show in the original stage production. However, good acting, great scenery and costumes - pity some of the original funny dialogue from the other characters and some songs were cut to make Ms. Burnett look good!Disappointing"
3,OK But.....,"Having this version of the musical is great but it can't compare to the one that was broadcast some years back with Ms Burnett as Princess Winnifred. As I remember the cast consisted of Burnadette Peters as Lady Larken and Jack Gilford as the silent king. Those two stand in my memory with the rest of cast up to the material. I think that the song ""I'm Shy"" backed by Ms. Burnette's lung power is one of the great pieces of comic theater. It would be great if it would come out on DVD so we could compare the two."
2,A Good Show,"I've really fallen in love with this musical. I have to say that I was really disappointed when I realized some of the best gags, and a few songs were completely left out of this film version. Overall, though, this film captures most of the spirit and of the stage version and featured some good cast selections. I'm not quite sure why they thought Tracy Ullman looked young enough to play Princess Winnifred, but she does a great job. Carol Burnett is awesome as the Queen, and she really steals the whole show."
3,"Amusing update to ""Princess and the Pea""","Flat out goofiness really makes this movie. The over-protective, over-possessive queen, blandly ineffectual king, and infantile prince give plenty to work with. Then, when Winnifred shows up as a contender for the ""princess"" role, there's a new force to contend with. Much to the queen's dismay, Winnifred (or ""Fred"" as the prince calls her) might actually pass the unpassable tests that stand between Fred and her son.Nearly 50 years ago, when this fist came out, it must have been daring adult entertainment. Now, when even a VP-candidate's daughter starts her family before marriage, I'd say it's kid-safe for most households. It still gets laughs from the grown-ups, too. Go ahead - enjoy the silliness!-- wiredweird"
3,Once Upon a Disney,"With the exception of watching Carol Burnett play the Queen, this version is wrong on so many levels. Once again, Disney takes a classic show and turns it into a attraction fit for their theme park parades and shows. Mind you, I don't have anything against Disney and love their work and movies but why change what is a deligtful (and adult) fairy tale into a sanitized version of the Partridge Family? If you have never seen this done live, have fun with the DVD (and you might) but for true fans of the show, this was a huge disapointment. And why didn't they put the orginal version - with Burnett as Fred - on the extras? Shame, shame, shame!"
3,Why?,"So tired of all the greatest hits packages!Get a clue,get in the studio and give the fans some new material,if bands from this era want to show they are ""legit"",I know Cinderella should be able to deliver the goods.ATTENTION:All bands,enough with the greatest hits packages and remixes!I am not stupid,Please give us some new material!"
5,Great CD!,Got this for my husband as a Christmas gift. He loved it. He said it had most of their best songs on it and would highly recommend it to any Cinderella fan.
3,Tip Of The Iceberg,Forget all their greatest hits cd's. You need to buy each of their individual cd's. They only have 4 and every song is good.
4,Five great songs!,"In my view, five great songs is far than enough to make a good album. Night Songs, Shake Me, Nobody's Fool, Somebody Save Me, and Don't Know What You Got (till it's gone) are the five really good songs and the rest of the album is filled with boring bluesy fillers.More boring songs than good ones! But it's still better than your average album who usually countains no more than just one good song."
1,Did not really work for me much either....,"The book seems to be interesting at first. However, it does not portray what is going on today. The author instructs people to pick 150 contacts within the local job market and contact all of them. Where am I going to get 150 contacts or job openings? There are only few jobs openings even in my big city that I would be interested to explore. Then, who am I going to contact? Many organizations do a wonderful job at hiding those human resource managers' names and other contact info. When I tried to find out, they were not giving out their names or their contact information. The internet has not been helpful in that regard either. Overall, the strategies described in this book are not bad at all. However, the times are now different from what they were in 2005 (the date of its publication). If you can, employ those strategies. However, you will find there is not much to employ. Look elsewhere for the answers..."
1,Amateurish at best,"Mr. Wolfson has merely taken the content from another well-known and respected forensic art book, dumbed it down, and created a cheap imitation. Save your money for professional publications."
1,"good photos, bad editing","The author seems to be a pretty decent sculptor, but the book could definitely benefit from a spell-check! The typos are innumerable, and the writing not especially coherent. There doesn't appear to be much that is new here, and it seems to me that a published demonstration of forensic sculpture should feature more than a budget plastic skull, which may or may not even be cast from an actual human specimen. Stick with Karen Taylor or Caroline Wilkinson for very thorough descriptions of the American and Manchester methods of facial reconstruction (respectively) from renowned professionals. You won't be disappointed."
4,kids watch,My daughter loves this watch. It is comfortably priced and stylish enough that pre-teens who have outgrown the 'kiddies' watches will wear it.
1,Worthless band,"My daughter wanted a big girl watch for Christmas. She was so excited when she opened this. The first watch only lasted 2 days before the band ripped on one side and the pin fell out on the other. Amazon quickly sent us a replacement. Unfortunately, this one only lasted 2 weeks.My daughter isn't unusually rambunctious or destructive, so I don't know what the problem is. A kid's watch should be able to hold up to typical playing. I expected far more out of a Timex."
1,Fail.,"I bought this timex watch to my daughter, and it was ok for 1 month,and now it has stopped working. I think it needs a battery replacement.The watch was just 1 month old. How is it possible to have a battery failure after such a short time?For people who are planning to buy this watch.. take care of this big detail."
3,Handwriting Analysis As a Psychodiagnostic Tool,"I was excited to purchase the book but disappointed in that the language was way to cumbersome and difficult to grasp. The writing was hard to read due to its clinical context and was not easily explained. The sentences were paragraphs and the paragaphs were pages. It was too wordy, difficult to comprehend and unnecessarily complex. I feel the subject matter which was of great interest could have been explained in a much easier format without the run-on sentences and complicated explanations. It simply was not clearly delineated."
4,"Handwriting Analysis is bunk......well ,wait a minute!","If you read any of my reviews on handwriting analysis you know where I stand. However, this book presents a reasonable hypotisis on the subject. First, it does not get into each individual stroke as it relates to personality ( that's still bunk ), rather it presents an individual's handwriting characteristics as a wholtisic psychological study. What you will find here is rather different than the ""popular culuture"" notions of grapho-analysis. The author presents the total writing structure in an attempt to analyize personality. Does he succeed. Read the book and find out!"
1,bummer,"I was expecting a full score of this item and all I got was a used libretto, small paperback which I paid a ton for. I'd call it false advertising. I already have a libretto on a cd, this isn't what I needed, but I waited too long to send it back. Stupid."
5,Excellent masks,"I work with granite, which has silica in it and have been using these masks for years to protect against inhalation of granite dust and silicosis of the lungs. The masks are very effective, lightweight and durable. A real value for the money."
2,Not totally plastic!,"No where in the ad does it say that the actual rails connecting to the 2 end pieces are bloody METAL. Yes, it's still a matter of taking pliars to yank and hack off metal so that the dang thing will fit into the drawer. And, it does NOT just ""snap"" together. You firmly shove the ends of the metal rails into the plastic. Sigh. I thought this was going to be truly different and innovative. I'm still happy that the end pieces aren't metal, but as for the rest, I take issue with the way the product is advertised."
1,What a Joke! 20% too small to cover a twin mattress,"The 2"" topper is only about an inch thick. To make things worst it is about 20% too small for a twin mattress. It is very small being 5"" too short in both length and width since it is only 34"" wide and 70 inches long where a twin mattress is 39"" wide x 75"" long. Don't waste your money, it is too difficult to repackage for return/refund."
2,Product inadequacy,"I ordered a king size foam topper. When placed on our bed, it was short 3-4 inches on each side vertically. Horizontally it was just right.What should we do to stretch the topper so that it fits the bed exactly.Rodolfo RamosPurchaser"
3,Not what I expected...,"It works. I kept it. It was old looking, the foam was VERY yellowed. It is cut crooked, but it fits the bed & is not seen under a mattress pad. I expect better from an Amazon purchase."
3,Haven't slept on it yet,"This just arrived. I've been tracking and looking forward to it all day. I have a really crummy queen-size bed - the cheapest one I could find 6 years ago after my divorce - and it needs to be replaced within the next year. I've had had both an old foam ""eggcrate"" pad AND a feather mattress topper on it for 4 years, both of which needed to be replaced. When I saw this item on sale over the weekend I ordered it immediately because it was an incredible price. PLEASE ORDER ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN YOU NEED! I will admit to being disappointed when I opened the box because it is quite discolored - not at all the pretty white topper shown in the picture. I use white sheets so I suppose I will need to cover this with a traditional mattress pad so the discoloration doesn't show through. That disapppointed me and is the primary reason I have rated this a 3. That said, it looks so unbelieveably comfortable and I think I will be going to bed at about 8 tonight!"
2,Too Soft and Not Very Resilient,"I read the reviews so ordered a King Size for a Queen Bed. That being said, it was way too soft and didn't spring back like memory foam is supposed to. We had to remove it from the bed because my husband would sink down and then not be able to turn over. It was okay for me because I don't toss and turn, but he is all over the place and it was very uncomfortable for him."
4,Very Comfy !!,"Yes, it's tan color partially, but with the price, it's very very comfortable and I'm really satisfied with the product."
2,Not so good,"I bought this book because of the good reviews it got and it turns out it is just not my cup of tea. The Idea is good, but its just to much forcing sex because of some moon binding, so the main mail caracter can force the girl to do all kinds of things and ofcourse he only does this because he thinks she is a spy but neverthe less, I just don?t like this kind of sex. Being forced to do stuff agians your will, and he can order her to to anything, go there wait, stand sit, etc."
3,Interesting World,"The world building is close to her Riley Jensen series, but slightly different. Less edgy, more traditional romance. I found the plotting and foreshadowing to be pretty routine and easily predicted. I don't think I will look for the follow up novels, I like my PNR darker and this one just didn't hit the spot*I was provided a digital copy of this book by Netgalley in exchange for an honest review*"
2,Not one of Keri Arthurs better works.,This book wasn't really all that good of a read. It lacked a strong plot and what little plot there was seemed a lame excuse for soft-core porn scenes. Her more recent work is MUCH better.
1,I was very disappointed in this movie,"I think I have to be one of Shemar Moore's biggest fan. I even had the pleasure of meeting of him on 3 different occassions. But this movie was the worst I ever saw! I can't believe Nia Long, Salli Richardson and Ernie Hudson ever considered doing it. There was sooooooo many unanswered questions. The acting was poor, the script was lousy and the plot was terrible and totally unbelievable!! I was told this movie was supposed to hit the big screen but I guess it just wasn't good enough to make it there, and if you saw this movie, you would know why. And I tell you what, had I of seen this movie in the theater and paid $6.75 for it, I would of demanded my money back!! I guess every good actor has it's flop of a movie, and this was definitely Shemar Moore's. The only thing about this movie that I liked, is that I was able to watch Shemar for 2 hours straight instead of the 10 mins he gets on the Young & the Restless."
4,Shemar was great in his first movie......,"This was a surprisingly good movie. It's started off a bit slow but it involved some mystery and action which kept my attention. I wish that Shemar and Nia would have had a decent love scene, the movie did call for it."
1,Horrible,"This movie was horrible, the acting was horrible from Shemar Moore, the actors must of been desperate for money."
4,"The movie is one like no other, it's really a thriller!",The movie was a great action film but it could have been a little more suspensful. Personally the onlly reason why I originally picked the movie out is because I love Shemar Moore.
1,You're guaranteed to learn nothing,"This is just a video of guys reeling in stripers sitting in the same spot in front of a dam. Its nothing that you cant already find on YouTube. You will learn nothing. One person spends 15 seconds explainng the bait he was using, but other then that, they dont even video tape the strikes...Its basically just guys reeling in fish.. save your money and watch the same boring videos on YouTube."
5,Improved Vision.,This Ointment was recommended for me by me eye doctor. My vis ion has improved to some extent. I found it to be at a saving by using Amazon.
2,Not what I expected!,I only received ONE VERY SMALL TUBE of the ointment and was dissappointed with the amount I got for the price paid! You would be better off buying a similar larger product at a chain drug store!
3,Response to Product Rating,"I did not realize it was an ""ointment"" product; I liked the idea of having two containers, but I assumed it was in the flluid ounce liquid solution. I will be more observant the next time I order this product. The ointment is much harder to apply, and will not last nearly as long as the opthaimic solution. This was not your fault; I do not hold you responsible for my oversight."
5,this ointment works just as it should,My opthamologist prescribed this for me and I am very pleased with it. It works well. I use it during the night to keep my eyes from getting too dry.
1,1 Oz at Amazon is better bargain,They asked me to review this after I bought the 1 Oz from Amazon including shipping at 31.70. Twice the volume at nearly the same price. You figure it out.
5,Good Stuff,"My ophthalmologist recommends this to prevent cornea abrasions. Don't like having to use the stuff, but a cornea abrasion is a lot worse."
5,Better than expected,"I'm not going to lie I wasn't really a huge fan of B2k, but I did get mad when they broke up weird right? Lol. But anyway I loved the first album that's why I went for the second one. I bought it the first day it came out, I bought the last one from Circuit City lucky me. But I didn't listen to it until the second day, I told myself I wouldn't listen to the whole thing so I didn't listen to like three tracks. But I love his album. Now I am a huge fan of Omarion. People listen to Electric, that beat is so hot. But hey most of the beats on this album is hot. So I say pick up this album, cause I highly recommend it. I never write reviews on albums and I am a huge music fanatic and if a music artist doesn't have talent I speak my mind on that. But if O keeps putting out these hits and banging albums I see longeivity in his future."
4,Damn fine,"I thought this was a great book. It kept me on the edge the whole time I read it. I couldn't put it down. I'm thinking about reading it again, just to make sure I didn't miss anythign. A defenate buy."
5,A truly masterful pairing.,"The flute and piano chase, mimic, dance and swing arm in arm thrugh this truly enjoyable compilation. I have listened to this album literally hundreds of times over 15 years without tiring. Wonderful, emotional, meaningful music, easily worthy of a 5 star rating. I would recommend it to strangers on the street."
5,I love it!,"THIS BOOK IS GREAT! I for one, am very critical about books. It has to be perfect for me to love it and this one is. It has more action than the first one, Hero's Song, and it has a very little bit of romance. Not enough to be disgusting, but a subtle hint if you look closely. Our old heros, Brie, Collun, Sillien, return, along with new ones. It is more of Brie's adventure this time. It's not exactly a cliffhanger, but there can obviously be more to come. I hope Ms. Pattou writes the third book soon!"
3,not the best................,"ok i feel real stupid writing this review because i must be the only person alive who didnt totally love it. the book was ok. there it wasnt the best i have read but it wasnt the wrost i have read either. there defaintly wasnt any romance in this unless u call the way brie misses collunn 'love'. the idea was very good but the way the author oderd the events and had them happen kinda a ruined it. the begaining was quit good, near the middle it sotra dropped and at the end it just fell. u may not feel the same way about the book as i do, but if u want a really good fantasy read any thing by tamora pierce. if u dont agree with me (which u probaly dont) feel free to e-mail me any time. so thanks for reading my reveiw and i hope u dont base your whole idea of the book on this one article. there r people who loved and hey u might be one of them."
5,Flame girl hits a six!!,"This book is great for fans of Tolkien, Nix,etc. With great plot, charactors,a little romance and a big suprise at the end, you will love this page turner, males and females alike!!"
5,I love this book !!!,To put it simply this book is AWESOME. I am a big fan of fantasy and for those of you who are this book is for you. It is a bit romantic but I like a little bit of romance. Not too much to make it mushy but enough to make it sweet. I haven't read the first book but I understood this one pretty good. I simply fell in love with Collun. He's so calm yet exciting at times. I can't wait to read the first book. And if there is a third one I would love to read it too.
3,Good young adult read,"Good young adult read. Something was laking for me in this book, couldn't quite put my finger on it. But overall good story."
5,A surprising focus on just trolls,"This was released early last year but deserves ongoing mention for fans of fantasy in general and Norwegian folk stories in particular, offering a surprising narrowed focus on trolls and revising and expanding a previous title. Troll adventures appear in both stories and poems by Norwegian writers including such famous names as Henrik Ibsen."
2,cheap look and feel,"This book is an editorial nightmare, with accidentally duplicated artworks and such, and has just about the cheapest physical feel I've ever encountered in a paperback. Further, there's nothing to be gained from these rough-and-ready translations--cobbled together, as they are, with dim-witted recipes, jokes, and such--that can't be gleaned from the combination of Asbjornsen and Moe's epic work and Boose's comprehensive Scandinavian chrestomathy."
4,Death Metal?,"so apparently (according to the kranky records website), the lads in growing describe their music as metal. i'd say that this couldn't be further from the truth to my ears. i suppose the layers of heavily distorted guitar droning on in the background/foreground could qualify it as a metal record. i'd place it in a genre somewhere between brian eno's ""ambient 4: on land"" and mogwai's quieter guitar-shaped moments.regardless of classification or genre, it's a fantastic album to set your room to. it fills the aural space with a flowing tapestry ranging from the critically dark to the heavenly angelic. not quite ambient enough to fade to the back of your mind, and not quite foreground enough to hum along to. it wouldn't be out of place next to your copy of my bloody valentine's ""loveless"" or the first silver mt. zion album. like all good albums, worth multiple listens, and far superior on vinyl."
5,Life and times of foster and allen,This is an absolutely fantastic video of the Irish group Foster and Allen...The scenery in the clips are of Ireland and its so beautiful..They are fantastic Ballad singers more than anything else
5,Herzog-Popol Vuh Realmente lo Mejor,"Este es uno de los mejores discos de musica de pelicula que he escuchado. Realmente la dupla Herzog-Popol Vuh tiene magia.Desde el gran comienzo con Woe be to Khorazin (de Fitzcarraldo), con su gran coro y despliegue de instrumentos sumado a lo místico característico de Popol Vuh, pasando por Nosferatu con su halo de misterio y oscuridad y terminando con Aguirre la Ira de Dios, evocando claramente el rio Amazonas y la figura de Aguirre bajando por él, sin duda alguna dan al film el despliegue de medios sonoros y musicales necesarios para dar vida a las imágenes.Todo aquel que dícese llamarse fanático del cine fantástico debe tener este CD."
4,Kid's love these robots too - not just a collectible.,My son has a love of windup robots thanks to Max and Ruby by Rosemary Wells. We gave him his first one at age 4 and it didn't hold up too well to the curiosity of a young boy. Now at age 5 his collection is holding up pretty well. Let's just hope the paint doesn't have high amount's of lead...........
4,SUPER winch,"I am very happy with my s5000 superwinch. I used it to drag a old car onto my trailer that hasn't moved since 1984. Using a snatch block, I dragged the car with 3 flat tires with only the front tires turning. The only problem I had was the cable wanted to roll up on one side. The long control cable made it easy to walk around and do what needed to be done because I loaded it by myself."
3,Loose Connections,After I first installed the winch it didn't operate under load. The trouble shooting guide pointed me to look for loose connections. After I checked all the connections I had made the unit still did not work. I then removed the cover and found that NONE of the internal connections had been tightened. After I tightened the connections the unit has operated without problem.
1,Very Poor Video Quality,The movie story itself is great. But the poor video quality made it difficult to watch. The sound was off most the time and the video had a reddish/orange tint the second half. The DVD stops at a certain point about 3/4 the way into the movie and just freezes. VERY BAD COPY!!! No English subtitles for the scenes in another language.
1,"VERY, VERY POOR QUALITY COPY","I had to try three different DVD players just to get my copy to load. When it did, there were many pauses with very poor video and audio quality. I think marketing something of this ""non-quality"" for $26.99 is just short of criminal!"
5,"Tesla, Edison, Electricity","everyone should see this movie just to know who Tesla was and his contributions and to also know about Edison and how he tried to control everything.Tesla has so many patents and discovered so much about things in his time that we are using today, even before there was a use for it in his time.if it wasn't for corporate greed things would be alot different now because of his ideas.yes its a poor quality video, but its the only thing available, seems a copy of the videotape made to dvd.but at least its available, and rather complain about the quality, be thankful we can still get this valuable story."
2,"Almost-decent escapism, but FAR below Mr. Caidin's usual.","As a long-time fan of Mr. Caidin's, who literally grew to love reading as a child b/c of ""Thunderbolt!"", ""Flying Forts"", and ""P-38: The Fork-Tailed Devil"", I was ecstatic when I saw this book in the bargain bin. Unfortunatey, this book seems to have been written in about 2 hours; the parts with the most potential are over before you know it, and the ""suspensions of disbelief"" that are required are inconsistent and way too extreme. This book might be enjoyable for someone who is easily entertained and very uncritical (is that a word?), but it will harshly disappoint anyone who expects Mr. Caidin's usual brilliance."
4,A fun read,"When I first saw the title of this book, I thought 'No way! Someone has tried to recapture the Buck Roger's space opera epic.' then I saw the author and took interest. Mr. Caidin has done a great job at updating this tale. Agreed, it is not a major work in terms of the brilliant work he's done in the past, but it is still a wonderful read. If you are a techie that enjoys a formula space opera, then this is a good, and fun read. Nicely done."
3,"Better than what we had for sure, but not great","We bought this fan almost two years ago and finally got around to the bathroom remodel and installed this fan. While it looks but better than the thirty year old fan that was in there, I am sorely disappointed in the amount of noise that it makes. I was under the impression that it would be whisper quiet, which it is definitely not! Again, much better than what we had before, but not silent by any means."
1,Waste of Money,"I live in a country outside the United States, where we only use bank issued checks. We do not buy check forms and print customize checks ourselves. One-Write Plus has pre-determined check printing format or template and does not allow you to adjust print location of date, amount, and payee name, on the check. I wasted my money on OWP!In addition to that, Peachtree Customer Service is as lousy as it can get. I'm asking for a refund."
1,Disturbing images,Be aware that the pictures are disturbing for young children. The giant reminds my husband of Sloth from the Goonies. This was supposed to be for my 5 year old son and I am returning it because I know it will give him nightmares.
4,Jack and the Beanstalk,This book was very good and had a lot of humor. The authorreally gets into telling us how Jack got the magic beans bytrading his cow for them. His mother thought he was dumb forbuying the beans. So he throws them out the window then growand Jack climbs the stalk to the top. While looking around seesthe giant then steals his harp. When Jack gets to the bottomand while the giant was climbing Jack choped the giants stalk.So the giant is destroyed and everybody lives happily everafter. This would be a good book for a fairy tale loving person.
4,I agree with the author of this book.,"I went through sorority rush at California State University, Long Beach in the mid seventies. After reading this book I understand why I was totally rejected by all the sororities on campus. The main reason I was rejected because I was overweight. This was because of a medical problem that I had at the time, it was not from overeating. One of the chippies in one of the sororities told me that they might ""take me up"" but that she couldn't ""make any promises"". Another sorority telephoned me and invited me to dinner and tghen called me the same day and told me that they were going to have ""initiation of officers"" and not to come. They said that they would ""get back to me"" but they never did. No one ever asked me about my family background. My father was a Naval officer who was present at Pearl Harbor at the time it was bombed. So after reading this book I know now what was going on during sorority rush."
2,Broken bracelet,"I loved this bracelet. It was heavy and beautiful and I loved the saying on it. Unfortunately, since it's a cuff and I had to pull it a bit to take it off (you have to open it a little to get it on and off and tighten it when you get it on so that it doesn't fall off but that's normal with cuff bracelets), it actually broke in half the first day that I wore it and was taking it off. I didn't think that I pulled it that hard so it seems to me that it broke pretty easily. It's a beautiful bracelet but you have to be careful with it."
1,Not worth the shipping,"When I got this bracelet, I tried to make it a bit larger before putting it on and it snapped and broke in half. It is pot metal covered with a silver coating. Junk!"
5,A must see for any Disney Fan,"Although I am a huge Disney fan, I honestly had no idea that the relationship between the brothers was so strained. Not only is this documentary a great chronicle of all of their wonderful catchy songs, it is a great account of their backgrounds, family lives, and professional lives. It is evident that the strain of their relationship is particularly hard on Richard and both of their families. There are many touching parts that will leave you in tears but regardless, you get to know the two wonderful boys that many of us only thought we knew. I will never watch one of the movies or stage productions with their songs without really appreciating their efforts again. It is my wish that the brothers take whatever time they have left to reconcile and appreciate each other for who they are."
2,disappointed,WAS HOPING THIS DVD WOULD HAVE STRICKLY FOCUSED ON THE WRITING OF THESE SONGS BY TAKING A NUMBER OF THE MOST POPULAR SHERMAN SONGS AND RECREATE THE PROCESS SUCH AS THIS IS HOW I CREATED THE MELODY FOR FEED THE BIRDS OR HUSHABYE MOUNTAIN ETC I FEEL ITS MAIN FOCUS WAS ON THEIR PERSONAL LIVES ALTHOUGH TOUCHING AT TIMES I THINK PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THIS DVD WOULD PREFER MORE EMPHASIS ON THE WRITING PROCESS
4,"Amazing film, but video quality was terrible...","This documentary was very entertaining and completely full of information, I loved every minute of it. I am giving the movie 5 stars, but the video quality was terrible, and would freeze about every 10 minutes and refuse to start again. The quality was so terrible that Amazon even refunded me my money because of it! Back to the movie though, it is a MUST see for any music/Disney fan! Greg and Jeff did an amazing job!"
5,Great piece of cookware,"its big and is going to be very useful in a number of ways. I've used it in the oven and stovetop, it works great. I love the fact that it ISN""T nonstick I don't the nonstick cookware."
1,Did Calphalon make a mistake on this one?,"I was going to purchase this 7qt dutch oven BUT after reading reviews I have changed my mind. It seems from other reviewers, that this piece is definately NOT commercial grade (like my 12qt stock pot is). Too light weight to be commercial and the fact that they don't even make this in the USA is another reason. I have several pieces of Calphalon, each of those pieces are quality made. Perhaps Calphalon will wake up and realize what they have done! If you what a cheap piece of cookware, then buy this pot. If you don't want a cheap piece, then I would stay clear of this one. For me personally, I will take the quality first."
4,Very useful size...,"This is a great pot if you know what you are getting. First of all, Calphalon's Commercial Hard Anodized line is NOT non-stick in the traditional sense, they make other lines that are, but this one is not. That said, if you follow the instructions, it does things a non-stick pot/pan can't do and cleans up very easily. It's especially good at searing and creating flavor in deglazing. At this point though I use this pot mainly for things like stews or chili. It does make a great pot roast too if that's your goal. I took one star off because it's not the same really heavy gauge as most of the other pots and pans I have from their Commercial Hard Anodized line. It's still a good pot, but noticeably lighter gauge. None of the this line is dishwasher safe either, if that's an issue for you."
2,Calphalon Commercial Disaster,"The pot is lightweight and definitely not Commercial grade as indicated in the description. There are only two good things about the pot as far as I'm concerned: the domed lid and the size. Over-all, I'd rate it poor quality and I would never have made the purchase if I'd touched it. If you're a serious cook -- don't buy it."
1,returned,I did not care for this product. I have used Calphalon commercial Hard Anodized products before but for some reason this was a disappointment. They did not clean well and the handles were poorly made. I have since learned there are different grades of Calphalon.
3,meh..,Had to buy this book for a class. It was kinda interesting?? It didnt really capture my attention and was hard to understand at times.
3,Cat Silver Tone & Multicolor Magnetic Bracelet,"I love the detail of this enameled bracelet, the only disadvantage is that it is heavy. The seller was very prompt in sending it. So very pleased with them."
2,Not the best,"I read it to my 3 year old grandaughter and she was not very responsive. I think it is hard for a 3 year old to relate to. She didn't want to read it again and frankly neither did I.I was alittle surprised by the refernce to ""a black man singing in the west"" She doesn't even know there are differences between white men, black men or green men.I will read it again when she expresses an interest and next time I'll just say "" a man singing in the west"""
1,LCD displays go bad,"I have five of the handsets and they are all showing the same problem, reported by other owners. The LCD displays go bad. Horizontal lines on the display fail, and as more and more lines fail, the displays become unreadable. Because it is happening to handsets bought at different times, and other people see the same problem, it is obviously a design or manufacturing problem which GE has failed to address.I also find that the battery life is not very good - not the time between recharges, but the overall useful lifetime.It is unfortunate that the handsets have these problems, because the system works well as a phone system."
2,Problem out of the box,Bad batteries - won't take a charge when received as new. Works after replacing batteries. Some displays failing shortly even though the phone is still usable.
2,Pointless,"It got there and it was fine but there is very little point to this item, because you need to have a corresponding phone and that is not made clear in the description."
3,Not comfortable when held to the ear,"At first I thought that I'd never had a phone with such awful sound quality. Then I realized that it was because I had the base next to my computer, and EM interference from the computer was causing the problem. Sound was fine afterward. However, it's just not that comfortable to hold up to your ear for a while."
3,Have to go with it,"I have three other handsets at my business and the handsets are continually failing. I do not want to buy another phone system, so i keep replacing the handsets. The biggest problem has been the display. I guess that is why they are on clearance"
5,Great Deal,"I bought this extendable 2-line phone system several years ago. it worked fine until some of the handsets started loosing screen images. I did replace batteries prior & tried this again ,to no avail. Then I was looking at a new system at $400 for base & 4 extra handsets. I bought these 6 handsets for less than the replacement batteries would cost and now I have a system with 8 handsets, good as new for under $80. Better house coverage than I had and I still have two handsets in reserve for replacements at a later date. KoolEST"
1,For rubber bridge only,"Bobby Wolff wrote only a 1 page preface. Take his name off of the add for this book.The information in the book is only applicable to rubber bridge. For serious duplicate bridge players, it is useless. It is written at a beginner's level.I kept page 12 (a table of leads from different combinations) and threw the rest away.It might be useful to beginners who only play rubber bridge."
3,Not bad,"I haven't found too many horror movies online that I liked, but this one isn't a yawner. It's pretty interesting, and keeps the culprit hidden (successfully) until the last 15 min. of the movie. The bloody scenes are quick flashes of .. well gore .. and you don't get the over the top gratuitous, 3 min. long blood splatters in this movie, so it should be entertaining to most casual horror fans."
3,B Movie!,"Your typical B movie. All the classic things are there. The Voodoo box is a nice twist though, bringing classic and modern together."
2,"DARK, DARK ALBUM","Even though I respect the players in this band a great deal individually, Gov't Mule leaves a lot to be desired in my mind. Most of their songs seem so depressing, and too many of them sound alike..Just one opinion"
2,"Dis-a-poin-ted (thump, thump, thump-thump-thump)","Really liked the first album and, not to get into any of those esoteric musical critiques (I've not the talent or schooling for such), I just found the music kinda boring, and the rythms kinda trite. Track after track on the first was interesting, fresh, conveying well their sought-after male emotions of frustration and (less) anger. But this last album: It's the kind of music that I'd be embarrassed for someone to hear coming out of my room. Tacky. Loved the first one, though. And looking forward to seeing the third on sale."
2,Disappointed,"After hearing of the mighty Gov't Mule for several years now, I finally decided to take the plunge. I am very disappointed. Perhaps I chose the wrong album to start with? Maybe only once or twice is some sort of tangible ""groove"" established on this album. The rest is off-beat guitar hooks that go on for way too long and a drummer who doesn't know when to stop playing fills."
4,good songwriting adds to jam,"This effort reflects a marked improvement in Gov't mule's song writing efforts. Overall this recording is eccelent. Thorazine is an all time classic in my cavernous mind, no pun intended. Enjoy."
5,Government Mule Continue Their Winning Ways Here,"Government Mule continue their winning ways on DOSE, further refining their blend of the classic Allman Brothers Band sound with that of such power trios as Cream, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Montrose, the Jeff Beck Group, Free, Mountain, and ZZ Top. There's even a Beatles cover with ""She Said, She Said"", as well as some more exotic instrumentation and an added jazz influence. The only problem is that the sound on my copy kept fading in and out. I don't know whether or not that was intentional. However, that shouldn't dissuade you from buying this album, for it is a wonderful piece of work."
5,HARD CORE SOUTHERN BLUES!,"If you like southern blues played in hard rock style,this disc is for you!These guys sound like a southern band should!No fillers on this cd,all tracks are outstanding!BUY IT!They don't have many recordings but what they do have is definately worth buying."
5,SHE SAID!,KICK A** GUTS ROCK N ROLL! Warren Hayes is a living legend and this album shows it! You definitely want to hear this album. Hyah MULE!!
3,I'll be seeing you,"Blind musician gets her sight back just in time to witness a serial killer strike. Unfortunately, the lead now suffers from visual agnosia (meaning that her mind is no longer used to seeing things) so there is often a delay between the actual event and her mind processing the image. So she doesn't realize she is a witness until several hours after the attack. While the skeptical police work to catch the killer, the death toll mounts and ultimately a mysterious connection is found between all the victims. Now the killer returns to snuff out the one witness who has seen him and lived.I would have to say that this was average to possibly a little below average except I really enjoy the Irish music that played on the sound-track. This was a very typical 'cop meets semi-helpless woman in distress and believes in her when no one else does' film. I liked it and I liked the music and if you like this sort of movie then this is a movie you will like."
3,Stowe and Quinn sizzle in this taut thriller,"A good plot, interestingly shot in Chicago, but what jams it is the incredibly hot chemistry between (cop) Aidan Quinn and (blind violinist)Madeleine Stowe. Some people just create voluptuous sexual chemistry, and these two do it! Stowe is excellent. Quinn and other cast very, very good. You'll like this film very much. The serial murder angle is even a little different and ok."
4,Donor Death,"I was glad I rented this one since I would have missed a great thriller otherwise. The acting, directing, story, sets, music were so good in fact I intend to purchase it. This is one of those sleepers you may have missed but are happy you find. Stowe and Quinn are great together and the rest the cast do fine jobs in their support roles.When a girl that was blinded by her cruel mother as a child is given her sight back as an adult, she starts a new life. But while her eyes are adjusting to the change she sees a murderer in her building. She then falls in love with the detective that doesn't believe her story. As he comes around to it, the case develops and we see how the murders tie together and we fear for more than just Stowe's character. Good quality DVD but no extras."
1,not their best,One or two good tracks at best. Most of it is just background sounds/music for the sound track of the movie. Dos not do them justice. Buy Monsters.
5,Blink,Blink is one of many Madeleine Stowe movies she is great at any role she plays in. Loved her in this flick as well.
3,3 Stars for Great Sexual Tension,"This is an okay movie...not great, not awful. What's most enjoyable is the building sexual tension between the two main characters, and when they finally hook up, it's hot. The sex scenes (esp. the second one) are really nicely done...and ladies, those eyes on Aiden Quinn don't hurt (though his hair is awful); he's just all around adorable in this."
5,one of my favorite movies of all time!,"I saw the trailer for this movie back in '94 when I saw the movie Malice, another great movie. Blink has one of the best trailers of all time too. I have seen this movie probably more than any other. great story line great music, great cast."
3,I'll be seeing you,"Blind musician gets her sight back just in time to witness a serial killer strike. Unfortunately, the lead now suffers from visual agnosia meaning that her mind is no longer used to seeing things and that there is often a delay between the actual event and her mind processing the image. So she doesn't realize she is a witness until several hours after the attack.

This was a very typical 'cop meets semi-helpless woman in distress and believes in her when no one else does' film. I liked it and I liked the music and if you like this sort of movie then this is a movie you will like."
5,Blink,Received CD promptly and in good condition. Was glad I could find this older moview at Amazon.
4,Blink soundtrack,I was a big hit. This was a gift and hard to findSo it was exciting to see the persons reaction tothe gift. Thanks
2,Great Movie but CD Music Disappointing,"I loved this movie and it was great hearing The Drovers' music. I thought the CD of the movie's music would have more singing, but there is only a bit of singing at the beginning and end. Most of it is ""mood"" type music that served as the background to action in the movie, and this is not really music but just atmospheric stuff that is kind of slow and depressing. I think there was more singing in the movie. Maybe my expectations were off."
1,Rock CD,"I can't remember why I even bought this artist and CD, but wish I hadn't. Being from the rock'n roll era of the fifties, it is not my type of music. If your into this, you'll love it!"
4,good,"I am actually just starting this book, I pay very close attention to detail and am pretty sure that daisy in this book is the sylvia from the end of the first book. Of course I understand that these are not the real names of the children, but why can't the authors use the same fake name when it carries over to the next book, so as not to confuse the reader. I have read other books where this has happened but they were written by two different people who were abused in the same foster home so I expected them to not have the same fake names for the other children but it made it very confusing for me to figure out which child was the same. I didn't expect that from the same author, even if she didn't remember what name she used, how hard would it be to look back at her first book to carry it over!"
1,Only buy this book if you want to give explicit instructions to your child on how to give/receive oral sex.,"Just happened to open this book up at library & could not believe my eyes. The cover indicates that it could be good for adolescent children. The page I opened up to read like something out of a porn magazine. Unbelievable. I am liberal-minded and do not believe in censorship generally, but this is way off base to be recommended for children!!!!!!"
2,good advice but boring,"they gave tons of good advice, but the overall book was pretty boring and not something I will want to go threw again and again exept maybe once a year or evrey two years if thats what my life comes to, but most likely it wont."
2,Incomplete Information,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I have done hours of research on all types of Bariatric surgery and this book is one of the least informative. Gastric Bypass is hown as the magic answer. Easy, simple, and the only way. In reality this is far from the truth. Gastric Bypass is a huge decision for a person to make, and one that should not be made unless the patient is adequately informed.Specifically the sections covering other surgical options (duodenal switch, gastric banding, etc.) are blatantly biased. While I realize this book is geared toward Gastric Bypass, that is no excuse to give false or incomplete information on other surgeries. Also, the sections on Gastric Bypass itself is very glossed over and makes it seem as though it will be a cure as opposed to a tool for weight loss.There are so many other informative books out there...this just isn't one of them."
3,Been there done that...,It's a great book if you've never read anyting on the topic before. Certianly helpful for those who are just starting thier journey of self forgiveness and understanding. But... if you've read anything on the subject... you've already read this.
1,"First, We are Victims","This book encourages victimhood. We are overweight because we live in a man's world. So carry around a feed-bag and soothe your anger.I agree that dieting as a result of self-hatred is a poor motivation that will never work. But I am overweight because of choices I made yesterday that are a reality today. It's not my husband's or my father's or anyone's fault.A better book is ""The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,"" which I am currently reading. This book teaches that we are only victims when we choose to be. Once we get that, we can go from their and dump all that anger-based, victimhood ""momentum."""
5,Finally! A solution to a difficult problem.,"The value of this book cannot be under-estimated. Many women berate themselves over a need to lose weight and yet find themselves unsuccessful again and again and again.This book encourages an exploration of the underlying issues that manifest themselves as a food/weight problem. There are many self-help books on the market dealing with this very painful subject but none, that I've read, have addressed the issue with the thoughtfulness and care with which these writers have.The book's greatest value is, not in that it describes a problem with which I can identify, but that it left me with the hope that it can be overcome. That hope is priceless."
5,A Wonderful Insight!,"After having spent a year in Costa Rica as an exchange student, I'm always looking for good reads about the Ticos and their culture. By pure chance I ended up at Barnes and Nobles one day and Richard Biesanz was doing a book signing for the collaborative book release. I found the book to be wonderfully insightful. Even if you aren't familiar with the Ticos you will find the book to be very intersting. The Biesanz let you look into all aspects of the life that the Costa Ricans lead, from the type of economy they have right down to their everyday lifestyle. From reading the book you will walk away with a better understanding of what makes the Ticos so special, and it will make you want to travel to Costa Rica and see it for yourself! It is a job well done! The Biesanz have a deep understanding and enjoyment of this culture and people, and you will feel that as you read the book."
4,almost as good as my favorite CR book!,"While Biesanz & company have produced a lucid and info-packed ""insider's"" book on Costa Rica, I still find that it comes in second to my favorite CR book, ""Costa Rica: The Last Country The Gods Made"": a hybrid of a coffee-table book, a social/ politcial discussion and a geological history in a series of essays and sidebars.The Last Country The Gods Made truly does live up to it's scope of topics. Aside from geology and social history, it covers the political and economic history of the country and emphasizes its liberal reformist tradition as exceptional in Central America.I just like the writing better because the subjects are leavened by humor and, at times, almost poetical diction.Also, frankly, the photos are better! And the prices are comparable so, maybe check them both out! But if you're on a budget, just buy The Last Country."
3,The Ticos,"My wife was all set to retire to Costa Rica before she read ""The Ticos"".Now however she is more hesitant. From that I conclude that maybe thebook is too honest and tells too much. (Warts and all).Anyway, we were going to go and see for ourselves what we find. Thanks for making us aware of the possible pitfalls.This is a very detailed book and I enjoy it very much."
4,All good,"The book was sent fast, I was cheaper that on stores and it is in good state. It only has a few highlights and underlining but they dont really affect."
3,Good book for specific info only,"Get this book if you want specific information on varieties of vegetables that do well in Georgia and specific planting dates for seed and transplants. Otherwise, this book is of marginal use. There is a lot of repeated information about soil amendments and a lot of vague references to pests. I would have liked to seen a section devoted to identifying and controlling pests and disease. I get the impression Walter Reeves just stuck his name on this book and left the rest up to the co-author and editor."
3,Perfect Phrases for Setting Performance Goals - not so perfect,"My reason for purchasing the book was to have a resouce for our employees to use as they are writing their goal statements based on the SMART goal matrix. I did not find it as helpful as I was hoping in demonstrating what a good, specific, measurable goals looks like. I think it gives you a few beginning words but should have expanded more within the examples."
2,Perfect Phrases for Setting Performance Goals,"When I order this book, I thought I will get lots of ready-to-use ""Goals"" which I can esay to set my subordinate's Goals. But I am very disappoint. Lots of Goals listing in the books are actually the working items not goals. Like ""Deposit completed backups..."", ""Schedule all planned shutdown..."". Therefore this book help me to setup the work items of my subordinate not set the goals.Sam"
2,Only for the fans,"This book is important to finish up that Dr. Who novelization collection, but lacks as literature.The televised show used wit and humor with a nice dose of slapstick. Some of this does not translate as well to the written word but most could have (as evidenced by other authors in the same genre).The writing is wordy and sometimes difficult to follow if you are reading this like most Dr. Who novels. (They usually are simplistic in vocabulary.) Cotton's use of the ""journal format"" of telling the story (ie Bram Stoker's Dracula) does not seem to work well for a Dr. Who novelization. While a good try, it does not seem appropriate for this story.I would reccomend instead, for the sci-fi consumer, the film version of this story (availible on VHS and PAL) which I found far more enjoyable."
3,"""Carry on Cleo"" Doctor Who-style","This historical story, set in the rule of Nero not long before the burning of Rome, had the distinction of being an experiment in a comedy in Doctor Who. This how included some props (and even cast members!) from ""Carry on Cleo"".The trick for Donald Cotton, who wrote the original script and also the novelisation, is that the televised story relies on both witty commentary and slapstick. Slapstick doesn't translate to the written word, so Mr Cotton plays up some of the witty wordplay and adds a new level of comedy by producing this as an epistolary novel rather than a straight novelisation.Extracts from the journal of Ian Chesterton, the diary of the Doctor, Nero's scrapbook and other sources combine together to lay out the televised story, but in an interesting format.It is a good strategy, which helps this book stand out amongst the many simple and straightforward novelisation of Doctor Who serials."
2,Only fair,"I loved Ellens newer ones affiliated with CRUNCH, so thought I would order more, but these are very dull and slow. Maybe ok for someone brand new to exercise"
1,Bad Backup Software,"Retrospect ""Express"", which comes with the 70 GB Rev drive, is anything but. Slowest backup software I have ever encountered. I am a computer geek and even I found the user interface to be obtuse and at times unfathomable. If you buy the drive, put money aside to buy a good backup software package."
4,One of my favorites!,"I love this pen, I wear it often, and it always gets noticed and appreciated.Only dislike is its a bit light, but quality is there!"
2,Pen skipped when writing,I bought this pen to replace the exact same pen that I had and lost. This one skipped when I didn't hold it at one particular angle - my previous pen didn't. I think the nib is slightly bent - I'm really busy so I didn't take the time to return it and ask for an undamaged one - but I was very disappointed because I loved the pen I lost. I hardly use this one because it skips.
5,It's staggering how much data is in this book at such a small size.,"Bought it for my friend Kim who was admiring my personal copy. My copy is much bigger in size (square, not content) and this one was very compact and perfect for the paranoid like me (and perhaps Kim at this point)."
5,Great book,I gave this to my son-in-law for Christmas and after perusing through it I want one for myself as well so I will be purchasing a second one. This book has everything! Very quick delivery and a no hassle purchase.
5,THE survival book,this is the be all end all of survival books. the author breaks it down by environments and situations as to what to do. plus how to set up camp and snares and how to cook the critters u catch in the snares. john wiseman the author does not fill the book with his war stories he keeps it to the point in a very organized manner GET THIS BOOK. its great to take camping or keep in you bug out bag.
4,"Great info, good read","This book has a ton of great info, a lot of which I personally learned in the Army. There is so much that I didn't know or was no too familiar with also. If you do a lot of camping or backpacking, this book would come in handy. Just make sure you actually try and practice what you read. You don't want your first time to be the time that your life depends on your skill."
4,Great reference book for pro's and Beginers,"Well written and easy to follow. I have been camping many times, but this puts things in a different perspective. Might be a life saver if you throw this in your BOB (but go ahead and read it first). I would pair this with a better reference book on plants to eat(with pics) and you should be set for any SHTF situation."
4,"Great content, but flimsy binding.","Title really says it all. The info is great and the content is thorough. However, I find myself fearing for the structural integrity of the book itself. It's a bit flimsy."
5,Lot's of Good Information in a Small Package,"I have only had a chance to scan through this book, but I could immediately see it is loaded with great information that just might save your life. It's also small enough to fit into a backpack and take up very little space."
4,SAS mini,"This is a GREAT survival book! I saw this at Barnes & Noble and loved it for the color pictures of plants/roots/flowers/etc. that are edible/poisonous/healing/etc. and for the helpful parts on different climates, conditions, and finding your bearings (directioning ability, not the little metal balls). I still might get the regular-sized version, but this is TRULY a (cargo) pocket-sized book. The print isn't too small at all. The pictures still show fine and helpful details. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON SOME OTHER BLACK AND WHITE, CHEAP PAPER BOOK! GET THIS ONE!!!"
3,Limited Content,"It's a good read. It covers the basics. I didn't expect the book to be the size of my palm, but it's content is enough for the average Joe. Now if you're being dropped into the Amazon jungle by yourself, then I wouldn't recommend it."
4,"Small, but full of info",Lots of good information in a very compact package. This book fits easily into a backpack or ATV trunk
2,Too small to read,This book is tiny and too small to read in an emergency. The expense reflects the usefulness. I am surprised it isn't a bit bigger so at least you could read it.
5,Great Survival Guide!,"One of the best books written on survival that I've read! Easy to follow directions, nice pictures, with clear and consise instructions. If you screw up in the field...it's probably because you didn't read this book! I especially liked the chapter on building emergency shelters. I bought the full sized version for my husband, now I'm going to purchase the smaller version for my backpack. Even if you don't go camping or hiking, this is just a great must have book to read!"
4,good survival guide,"The book was somewhat smaller than I realized. I had a bit of difficult time reading the small print in the book. But, other than that it was a good survival guide."
4,Great buy,Good book but I should have paid attention to the dimensions because it is a pocket sized edition. Tiny font on small pages but it was my own fault. Still a great buy.
5,Perfect POCKET SIZE,I decided to get the pocket size to keep with me since the original size would be too big and heavy to carry with me while I'm on the go. This is a palm size survival guide that is clear and easy to read if you aren't far sided (can't see close up). Like any small pocket sized book the lettering will be smaller so if you already have a hard time reading normal sized text I'd suggest you purchase a magnify glass to help you out. I plan to keep this little book with me as something to read if I'm waiting and fits perfectly in my purse or backpack without taking up too much space. Overall I am happy with the purchase and for the money spent it well was worth it since it barely cost anything. Item arrived very quickly.
5,Great book,"A very good book to learn survival techniques, hopefully you will never need them in a real situation. However, many of the things described in the book can be used in non-survival situations, just for the fun of it!"
4,Everything is covered.,"Wow. This book as all of the bases covered, and I mean all of them! Every concieveable situation is addressed in great detail. It's definitely a reference book vs a practical guide. This book is going to show you how to tie 3,756 kind of knots, which is awesome, but in reality, you probalby only need to know a few good ones and know them well.I would recommend. I'm glad I have it. I would buy it again."
5,Prepping,"Wow! This book is full of information. Will have to look over the basics for my location and then read the rest at leisure. I watchedthe video review by TJ Ford. It appears that he received a different version than the one I received. This book is 5x8 and nearly 600pages long. And again, alot of information to take in. Appears to be a great purchase that will end up in my BOB."
4,"Comprehensive, solid","This book contains comprehensive and solid advice for survival for days with little resource. It would be nicer if the book distinguishes survival tips geographically, in topics like edible plants."
4,Handy Guide - Awesome Size Too,"This is a handy little field guide that should help you out if you ever survive a plane crash, shipwreck, or get lost in the woods. The size of this book (about 3.5"" x 3"" x 1"") makes it easy to take it everywhere with you. Some of the concepts require more explanation than is given, and some of the diagrams could use a little better labeling, but overall it's a great tool. After all, you can't devote 8 pages to instructions on building a lean-to.I'd recommend it for the camper, boy-scout, and frequent traveller in your family."
3,SAS Survival Guide,I've had the SAS Survival Manual for years and purchased this guide to carry with me as part of my emergency survival kit. It packs a lot of information for such a small book and doesn't take up much space. Is it worth having? Can't hurt.
2,Not the full size version as expected.,Nowhere in the ad did it say it was miniature version. It is not what I expected. It is only the size of a very small book.Extremely dissappointed.
5,It really has everything!,"Like my title says, this book really does have everything. It has everything from what to do when a shark attacks to what bugs and plants you can eat to how to build animal traps and shelters. The only thing I would have changed is the pictures - for things like what plants to eat, it would have been nice to have actual photos instead of drawings. Some of the entries are a little brief, but that is quite understandable considering how much they crammed into a single book. A very fun book, even for the person not so adventure-inclined. Highly recommend!"
5,Small but packed full of great stuff,"I really couldn't have asked for better. Everything one needs to survive from basics of what to eat and not eat in the woods, how to make snares and fishing hooks, housing, fires you name it. Really a nice little find."
4,Great Info,Got the book out of curiosity. Read it cover to cover. Now its in my bug out bag. Great info. Can't use all the info but for the most part very informative in urban situations and out in the field.
5,Educational,Even if you don't think you'll end up in a survival situation you should still read this book. It has everything about everything. This guy really knows his stuff and if I was ever to be caught in a hairy situation he'd be the bloke I'd want beside me.
4,Another great Preparedness tool,"I attend a monthly Preparedness meeting in my area where we discuss various topics presented by ""specialists"" in those areas. In our last meeting this was highly recommended. So now it's in my library too, and I look forward to reviewing it. It surprised me that it was so small ... pocket size. Nice."
5,Important Life Saving Book!,This is another must have in case of emergency.The book covers a wide range of things that just may save your life!
4,Great info...,"Im in no way a survivalist, but do like to be prepared. The info in this book is quick and to the point. The book itself is tiny and I was a little disapointed when I got it. After thumbing through it and puting it in my go bag though, I really appreciate the small design. Fits perfect in a little side pocket."
4,this is sweet,I like this book and its packed with louds of info. It has one problem its small. So for those that have glasses. Well buy it.
4,Great buy but...,"Overall the book is of superb quality. I purchased this from Amazon.com directly, not through some other seller. The item was indeed new however it was printed upside down and backwards of the front cover. I expected a top quality item from Amazon not a misprint!"
3,Pocket survival guide,"This book has a lot of helpful survival tips which hopefully you would never actually need, but it is interesting to read. If you like to spend a few days out ""living off the land"" this book can give you some help. I was a bit surprised by the small size of the book. This is a very small book which was not evident from the main listing. The dimensions are listed down in the details, but it will fit in a shirt pocket and has very fine print, so if you don't have perfect eye sight, a magnifier of some sort would be helpful. The US Army and Ranger survival manuals, also available through Amazon, are more along the lines of a larger size paperback book as far as page size goes.The SAS book will fit easily into a backpack pocket."
5,Know I know what Rambo knows.,This book covers everything you would need know to survive in the woods or on a deserted island.
2,Why can I not get this Handbook sented,I do know why this Handbook is out of stock.I am ready to see if I can get my money back????
3,Review of : SAS Survival Guide Handbook,I think this book is very general in it's explanation of survival in specific areas of the world. I would recommend this book for those who are looking for suggestions on how to survive for a short time in the wilderness. There are other books out there that are more specific to certain climates and I would imagine that Lofty could even write those books knowing that he served with the SAS and probably put in a lot of field time.
5,Excellent book,"This book is comprehensive and extremely thorough. Diagrams and drawings supplement written instructions on everything from knot tying, snare construction, animal preperation and edible plants."
3,What was revised?,"The introduction mentions that life has changed greatly since the publication of the original edition of this book some twelve years ago and so it was revised.That's all. There's nothing mentioned as to what was updated or revised that tells what makes this worth buying, and my somewhat cursory examination shows very few changes. The author needs to learn how to tell potential buyers what he changed so as to give them an idea of whether or not they want to re-spend money to buy something they already have.***IMHO, if you have the original edition, you don't need buy this one.However, should this is your initial purchase of it, then this is not a bad book to begin learning about basic survival.***************************************************************There should be laws that require this ...... <g>"
3,"Good book, glossy pics would be nice","Needs glossy pictures of some things like plants, traps, and shelters. A sketch doesn't quite cut it when you're learnign about something completely new like making a snare/trap... I'd like to see some photographs of how they end up looking."
5,probably the best book you'll ever run across,"in plain and simple terms, if one thing can keep you alive, its the information in this book. its not taxing to read, and is simply crammed packed with information. so no matter if its walking with your spouse in the bush for an hour, or conquering Mt. Everest, with nothing but an evil grin and your trusty Swiss Army Knife, don't leave home without it, the information in this book will keep you alive when needed, so that you may talk about your adventure(s)."
3,Gary - SAS Survival Guide,"I like the book; it has VERY useful, detailed, information for anyone in a ""survival"" situation. However, it is 385 pages in a quite small book (approx 1""x3""x5""), and printed in VERY small font. The book size makes makes it nicely packable. BUT, if you are over 40 you'll definitely need glasses or a magnifier to read it."
4,All You Need ...and More,"I am a novice Prepper, so frankly I was overwhelmed by the information in this book. I keep returning to it and always find new and useful information. Very useful if you are a hiker or any sort of outdoors person. Armageddon not required."
4,Helpful,"Very informative, would also like to see real pictures of the plants to be able to distinguish better. Other than that it's a good book for reference.I hope I never get to use it."
5,Highly informative,Just when you think you know everything. This book is a must have. If you want to be properly informed and prepared this book has got you covered. An easy read as well as very descriptive. Check it out you will not be disappointed.
4,Amazing book for those with a little experience,"This book has probably the most information packed into it than any other book I have read. Unfortunately it only briefly touches on each subject quickly. Much like an encyclopedia is crammed full of information on just about anything, but doesn't go into any one subject in great detail.Also there are a couple of things that aren't quite accurate but overall this book is a really amazing field guide on a lot of really amazing skills. However you want to try out a lot of these techniques before you try to use them in a real survival situation so you can figure out the fine nuances in each technique."
4,"Excellent handguide, only problem is a few spelling and grammar mistakes.","Like another reviewer said, this book does need some editing. Aside from that, there's not much to complain about. I've read this book almost front-to-back at least once, with plenty of re-reading about the important parts like creating your kit and identifying food (I've used the guide already to pick mushrooms, although I would prefer having a specialized book in identifying food, considering how risky it can be).I'd have to say I'm very pleased with the book and would buy it again if I had to, although I think I will supplement this book with a food guide, because you should never rely on a single object or source of information for everything, even if said object or source is outstanding.Plenty of other reviews have mentioned the contents, but if anyone wants to know if it contains a particular area that isn't mentioned, just comment and I'll get back to you."
5,Good Read,"Provides common sense reminders and new tips in applicable, bite-size chunks of information for just about any situation. At first glance through I learned several ways to get water, poisonous plats to avoid, build shelter and a latrine!My dad came to visit for three days and had is nose in this book the whole time!"
5,"Best book of Survival, but...","This book is really amazing, the best in his category, but I'm really disapointed with this revision edition. The book is the same than the older version. If you had the older one don't buy this one, it's the same. I can't find significative changes in this revision."
3,"Good book, nothing groundbreaking",The book is well put together but I feel 80% of it is common sense. If you have absolutely no outdoor skill then this might be just the ticket. If you've spent very much time without a roof over your head then you might be the slightest bit disappointed.
3,What's new/ updated?,"Book was compared to the older version and my husband did not find anything updated but the front cover! It has the author's middle name on it. The book does have great information, I just was hoping for some updates?!!!"
5,Great read!,"This book is nothing better than spectacular, and I repeat is spectacular! By no means am I an accomplished survivalist, but since I started my survival kit this last month, I was looking for a book to compliment my project. This book gives you complete details in any situation and it is an easy read. I recommend to anyone who is interested in emergency preparedness or if you are a beginner in knowledge of the outback!"
5,Great Book!!!,I have been reading this book for a while now and I will have to say it is a great book. Even if you do not want to sit down and take the time to read the entire book it makes a great reference guide with everything you will need to know about survival in many different situations.
3,World Survival Guide,"This product teaches you survival for anywhere in the world. Good product, illustrations could have been better."
3,a must read,"If you're the self-sufficient type than this is a book you should read. If you don't think that you'll need to defend your homestead, than you should read this book. If you don't think that you will ever use anything in this book, than you should read this book. Yes, I think that if you are a human with a pulse that you should read this book. It's that good."
2,"A book for the 'Couch"" outdoorsman/survivalist.","Not a terrible book by any means, but many better titles are available on the subject. Did not go into the bin, actually made it into the box in the closet.This book attempts to deal with too much subject matter, covering none in enough detail to help in the field.Cannot recommend."
2,"Detailed, but I don't plan on visiting any polar regions any time soon.","This book is quite comprehensive and it's a great reference to have a hard copy of. It reads a little bland, but I think it's main intent is to disseminate information, not to entertain. I'd prefer reading about surviving in my locale as no major moves either to much colder, nor much hotter environments is in my near future. If you're in to survival oriented readings, I'd say it's a must have."
4,good,"was just disappointed that it took so long to get to me, which you can't really expect more, but if i knew that before hand......like the book and it was described the way it was."
4,Good book,"Good book, I learned a thing or two reading it, has a lot of material in it. It's pretty small but I find it convenient. Only problem I had was how long it took to receive it."
4,A Good Little Guide Covers a wide range of topics,This is the pocket version so it is small and easy to pack on hiking or camping trips. The Guide is full of good practical information one would need for surviving in the wild under a variety of climates and situations. This guide is filled with full color pictures and detailed diagrams to help illustrate the authors point.I would recommend this guide to beginner and moderate outdoor enthusiasts who are looking to expand their survival knowledge.
4,Great little handbook to have around,This thing is awesome. It's great to thumb through every once and a while and filled with useful information. Glad I bought it!!
4,Has everything you could need,"This book covers nearly any type of situation that can arise. It covers how to trap, clean, and cook animals and gives several options to construct a fire. If you are lost in the wilderness with a knife and this book you will do just fine. That being said, information is great, but most of the stuff in the book becomes much easier with practice."
1,Mongo's debacle,"I've been a big fan of the series since the beginning, and from Book #1 to this one---this is plainly the worst. Chesbro goes off on some tirade to validate his political views and spends much of the book having fun yanking the right wing's chain. Inadvertently, in his book they are right actually---the KGB really has infiltrated the country. Whether you're right or left, this mindless claptrap gets in the way of the story, and is a bizarre diversion that often makes no sense. As the series progresses, the Mongo-isms are reduced. The quirky books with a dwarf detective dabbling in the supernatural become standardized and they become routine. This is the series' nadir, though, lacking in charm, filled with irrelevant tirades. I'm working my way through the newer ones now--hope this isn't a sign of what is to come."
4,"Greeat set, poor range","Pros: Keyboard and mouse look and feel great. the keys on the keyboard press very smoothly and are very quiet. The layout is great and i like the insert key is moved away from its standard location. programmable buttons are nice. Mouse is very comfortable, zoom in/out feature on mouse is nice.Cons: Range is quite limited. Cannot hold a strong signal at about 6' when receiver is near PC tower or TV. Tried a better USB extension cable which supports USB 2.0 and still no go. I just put the receiver on the floor with the extension cable when in use and place it on the desk when not."
2,finally working,"Logitech 967688-0403 MX3200 Cordless Desktop Laser (Black). After the fourth update of the receiver firmware, the keyboard and mouse are finally working. I suffered for 7 months with this and Logitech should be ashamed to put out a product like this."
1,Not compatible with Vista basic,"While I was trying to install the various features a window popped up and said that this cordless desktop was not ""completely"" compatible with Vista. It wanted me to download the newest version of Yahoo ??????? What does Yahoo have to do with it ??? I can only get 4 of the features to work. The green light on top of the mouse went out right away. Don't know if it's supposed to or not. Am thinking of sending it back but love the tilting scroll button. Just got it Monday and am an experienced user. Have used Logitech products for many hears and never had a problem with them."
3,"Great keyboard, but not for me...","This keyboard has the nicest feel to me; the texture and softness of the keys is just right. The response is quick and there is no noticeable delay over the RF wireless connection within a reasonable distance. However, the function keys are the biggest design flaw of this otherwise nice keyboard. They're tiny, plastic, and just a pain to use in my opinion. The mouse is decent but I do prefer my old MX Laser mouse to it. Overall, this set is just ""okay"" and I personally do not use it anymore as I quickly moved it to the second computer and got the G15 gaming keyboard from Logitech."
4,So far so good,"I bought this product (including wireless keyboard and mouse) about a month ago, they seem work pretty well. one glitch is that i am using a macintosh computer, therefore a lot of features designed for windows system don't seem to work on my computer. but that's okay. all i need is to be able to type on the keyboard and use the mouse to click on and off windows. although the mouse is kind of heavy and seem clumsy, i think it still works better than the other wireless mouse i owned, which is made by microsoft (and it becamse a complete crap after a few months of uses). if you can get a rebate deal to purchase this product, go for it! this review is based on only one month of experience. i said this because some other electronic devices i bought turned out to be malfunctional after over a month uses. i hope this one will last for a long time. if it does okay after 1 year, i will come back and write another review again (to rave about its good)."
4,Excellent keyboard/mouse combo,"Highly recommend this keyboard/mouse combo. Keyboard has a very nice feel with soft touch and very quiet keys. Mouse works on just about any surface, could be a little larger for my hands, but otherwise feels comfortable. Very friendly with my KVM (IOGear) I can switch between multiple PC's and not have any drops.. switching is seemless. Would highly recommend users also install the third-party UberOptions SetPoint enhancements (http://www.mstar.net/users/rlowens). This lets you program just about any key on the mouse/keyboard and have it apply globally or per application. So in iTunes I can use the mouse alone to skip forward/back, change volume etc. In Word I can use the same mouse keys to do Cut/Paste instead. Very customizable."
3,First Cordless Mouse and Keyboard,"Well it's my first shot at a cordless mouse and keyboard and so far it's a worthwhile purchase. Had a problem getting it to work on the PC I wanted to use it on. Called Tech support for Logitech and they told me it was a Windows issue so tried it on my other PC and had no problem. Seems my newer machine wasn't recognizing the correct driver so I had to manually pick it. Seems weird that it wouldn't know which driver to pick, since it was on the machine, but that's computers. Unfortunately if I disconnect the USB connection on this machine I will have to repick the driver. Minor issue for me. It works fine now and I like it a lot. Very convenient to use short distances away from the desk with no communication issues whatsoever."
5,good wireless desktop,this wireless desktop kit is easy to setup and getrs good range. the battery life works well for using AA batteries. the mouse fits comfortably in the hand and has buttons for easy website navigation.
4,Superb wireless keyboard and Mouse,"I bought the Logitech Keyboard and Mouse after my OEM units were annoying me. The wires were always getting tangled so I splurged for this package. I honestly do not know how I ever managed without wireless peripherals. The back and forward buttons on the mouse are extremely efficient. The shortcut keys are quicker and overall it was a great purchase. On a side note, I picked up a logitech notebook mouse for my macbook. It was a definite improvement and made my mouse functions a lot easier. Logitech is one brand I would look for in all of my purchases."
4,Logitech Cordless Keyboard,"All is fine except the very small lettering on the keytops. I doubt that what is there will last long. The lettering appears to be a small decal, not a permanent part of the key cap."
3,Disapointed,"I am pleased with the function of the keyboard and the mouse, however the print on the keyboard keys ia too small for old eyes!"
4,Learn how to clean it.,"It depends on what you want. I have had mine for at least four years. I have velcro on the bottom of my receptor locacted in the corner of my desk. You can't notice it and it works fine. Maybe new keyboards type smoother, but mine is not the smoothest. I have the MX 3200 and paid extra for it. All it has is extra keys that do the same thing as your tool bar, so why bother? After years of use the key board keys became so dirty that compressed air would not solve the problem. I took a gamble, held the key board upside down and sprayed the crap out of it with rubbing alcohol then blew dry it with a hair drier. Guess what? It works perfectly!"
1,Keys constantly stick and construction is very cheap,"I bought this keyboard brand new and the keys have always stuck since purchasing. I should have returned it, but won't buy Logitech keyboards ever again."
2,Aggravating,"Both the keyboard and mouse are comfortable to use. However, I find the wireless mouse to be eratic and jumpy. I've cleaned the lens, tried different mouse pads, repositioned the USB dongle and waited through compute-intensive processes on my computer to no avail. My pet peeve with the keyboard is the zoom control along the right edge. It is hyper-sensitive. If so much as a single sheet of paper touches the edge of the keyboard, it wildly and unexpectedly zooms the content on screen. To make matters worse, the 100% button on my keyboard (which should restore the screen to normal magnification) doesn't work."
1,mouse died in two days,the mouse dided after two days now stuck with a dead mouse went to best but to get a replacement were it goes bad I can return it unlike amazon
3,"Ok Keyboard, Awsome Mouse","I upgraded from a microsoft wireless keyboard & mouse because the range was horrible, and i use my pc as a htpc from the couch. This logitech is much better for range, but not as good as older logitech keyboards, the range is only about 10-15 feet for good reception. The keyboard is sensitive, which takes awhile to get used to. Once you get used to it though, it seems nicer to me. An issue arises when I'm going back and forth every day from my work keyboard to my home keyboard.Media buttons on the top are small, and it can be hard to hit the right one, let alone hit them at all. I find the layout of the media/shortcut keys on the keyboard somewhat inconvienent. Over all the Keyboard is ok.The mouse is wonderful and I love everything about it."
2,BEWARE: 27 MHz sucks for office use!,"None of the documentation for this product warns you that it's using 27 MHz wireless, not 2.4 GHz.This is an old, cheap, and not very good wireless technology that means limited range and is very likely to get interference -- especially in a work environment (around other people).Be warned ..."
1,"Good design, can't turn off some anoying features, battery life is subpar","I found that this product had way too many features, like the tactile zoom function on the keyboard, I kept hitting it by accident and it kept zooming until I turned it off. Also the battery life on both the keyboard and mouse only lasted a month to two months at a time before needing to replace the batteries."
2,logitech mx3200 laser,the keyboard works fine but the mouse wasnt worth a nickle. ive already had to get my old mouse back out and am using that.
3,not good for CAD,"I ultimately returned the keyboard and mouse because I was looking for a mouse and keyboard that would integrate well with AutoCad. The tilt wheel on the mouse was too easy to move making frequent middle button use difficult. Better indexing would help this. I'm also not a fan of the zoom feature on the keyboard, it works with a varying degree of sucess and sometimes gets confused with other programs, I had to turn it off completely."
3,mx3200 laser set up,"the keyboard is very quiet- as expected- but... it does not tilt up enough for a comfortable rest, and thus typing is much slower than usual- infact, it is almost flat. I am looking at ways of making feet to raise it up- also, if you slip while typing on the left-hand side, the image(s) get larger-(quick zoom) and if you are not familiar with this feature, it can be very confusing. extremely difficult to set the clock also."
3,a clock?,"This keyboard works well, and was easy to install. It has a nice feel.However, for some reason they decided to add an LCD clock calendar at the top center. But, they were so lame that the clock has to be set using some combination of strange buttons on the keyboard. One would think that since the keyboard is connected to a PC, and the PC knows the time and date, that this could be communicated to the keyboard... What a disappointment to add features that look nice when you look at the box, but suck in implementation.I still have not figured out what to do with the ""Dynamic Search & Zoom""...The other buttons seem to work well.The mouse is satisfactory."
4,Keyboard,"The product functions very well, but the software may impact other software programs. In my case part of my Quicken program did not work. I have to exit Logitech software so that the Quicken program works."
4,Very Nice,"This product is made well. Good material, very sleek. The only problem is the range isnt very good."
2,Not too happy!,Logitech Cordless Desktop MX3200 LaserNot very happy with this keyboard. It just feel right and is hard to type on. Maybe it will just take some time to get the hang of it. I would return it if I could get a full return.......
4,Logitech Cordless Desktop MX3200 Laser,"I read all 120+ reviews and decided to get it any way, since almost 100 of them were 4-5 stars. The mouse is awsome, very comfortable and accurate. I like the search, and fwd/back buttons best. The keyboard was easy to set up, looks and feels good. Everything works like it's suppose to. As far as the small media buttons at the top, I only use volume up,down, and mute. So they're easy to hit. I'm docking it a star because the answer button didn't work in Yahoo Messenger. I haven't had a chance to try it in Windows Live Messenger. But the VoIP button launches either one. And of course the ""zoom"" thing on the left is a pain, only because it doesn't always return to 100% when you want it to.This is a fine set from Logitech, as with all of they're products, and especially for the price, 40 bucks w/shipping from Tech4Less. They have 1 left, if you don't buy it, I will. 'nuff said?"
3,"Great Keyboard, but has some quirks","I'm usually impressed with the quality of the Logitech products. And this product is no exception. The keyboard feels solid and the keys have a nice touch to them. Feels like a normal wired keyboard. The one issue I have is that the zoom / dynamic scrool control which is a touch sensitive strip is poorly placed. It's on the left side of the keyboard and if you're like me, you're often resting your left hand against the left side of the keyboard. Away from the keys.However, with the placement of this strip here, it's quite easy to take your screen and next thing you know you're looking at a screen you need an electron microscope to see. The good thing is that there's a 100% button that brings the scree instantly back to ""normal"" viewing.Overall, it's a good product. Enjoy"
2,Not so great!,"This is a very awkward keyboard to type on, it has actually affected my typing accuracy. It also has a VERY ANNOYING zoom feature on the left hand side and no matter how I set the sensitivity everytime a piece of paper lands on it, it messes up my screen. Oh, and when I actully want to use the zoom it usually won't work. It could be a nice keyboard if it were more ergonomatic and it lost the zoom feature or if it at least had the ability to shut it off!"
4,Excellent for those under 40,I received this set as a present and I am very pleased. It can be as customized as anyone could want or the extra buttons can be ignored. My only problem is that the letters on the keyboard are smaller and dimmer than is usual. This makes for a sleek look but also makes me feel it is time for reading glasses.
4,Great keyboard with one flaw,"I really like so much about this keyboard/mouse combination: easy setup, good looks, comfortable for typing, quiet keyboard, convenient scroll feature on the left side... BUT there is one flaw, which is why I've now had to buy my THIRD one. Logitech has done a poor job with whatever method they are using to apply the lettering on the keycaps as the slightest bit of moisture or even residual moisture lotion on my fingertaps has ended up wiping out the lettering from the keys. While much of my typing can be done without looking at the keys, it is very cumbersome and ultimately results in mistakes as as many as 20 keys lose their lettering in one session. I even tried buying replacement letters, which were not only expensive--they looked odd and the edges hurt my fingertips--so they need to find a way to seal in the lettering. Otherwise, I've been quite happy with this combination."
1,Avoid buying this and choose something else,I purchased this last month thinking it was going to be a solid product from Logitech. It is GARBAGE. And for almost $100! I wanted a laser mouse for my photo editing. Well the mouse does not work well with Windows XP and it jumps all over the screen erratically rendering it completely useless. There is virtually nothing on their support site to fix the problem.I would strongly recommend going with another keyboard and mouse.
4,Works as Expected,"Purchased approx. a month ago and it works as I expected...which means it's a Logitech product so, of course, it works well and very dependably. It has more features than I need but that's OK, I just needed the freedom from wires in the space I have now. I wish I could get it with a wireless Trackman, as that is my favorite style of mouse, but they don't offer that option."
4,Great mouse but keyboard needs attention,"Mouse design and features are great. Keyboard works fine but is a little ""busy"" and zoom feature is in a poor position - at least for me. Soft padding material on both pieces attracts way too much fingerprints/smudges."
4,Logitech MX3200,"Nice keyboard and mouse, Logitech has big market share, so quality is pretty standard and above. However the mouse kills battery fast, recommend to use rechargeable batteries. I bought the refurbish one around $40, don't know if it has to do with the power consumption."
4,happy with purchase,"Keyboard and mouse works well.Install was easy, with download from Logitech site, for latest SetPoint software.Help section(for programming keyboard)a little confusing,but a call to logitech support solved any problems or questions I had."
4,Better than my Old Microsoft Wireless Setup!,"If you're a Mac user, make sure you understand this doesn't include Mac support for the extra buttons and keyboard features - included drivers are for Windows only! While it will work in basic mode with a Mac, you won't be able to program any of the special keys.The mouse is really good, better than many other mice I've seen in the Logitech wireless bundles, when it comes to comfort in hands - it's not tiny and uncomfortable. The keyboard, while non ergonomic feels solid and is good to type on. Signals aren't dropped like on my old Microsoft 6000 setup. If you need a reliable wireless setup and a comfortable mouse is important to you, I'd recommend this package from Logitech."
4,Good product for the price,You get a decent product for what you pay. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:-Keyboard keys soft and quiet-Mouse comfortable to use-Reception perfect-Keyboard and mouse design-Clock/timer built into keyboard-Software allows mapping keyboard keys and mouse buttons to different functionsCons:-Battery life for mouse. Advise using rechargeable. I'm only 1 month in and am getting critical battery warnings (although they seem to come and go)-Had to install the software a couple of times to get it to work. Still get startup errors sometimes when booting into XP.-Still getting used to the design of the delete/home/end/page up/down grouping of keys (different than standard keyboards)
2,not vista compatible - BEWARE,I have vista. Purchased mx3200 to replace cheap hp keyboard/mouse which came with new hp computer. Hooked up right out of box (no instruction manual included) - mouse/keyboard worked immediately. Did not try all bells/whistles on keyboard or mouse but basic functions were ok. Then next morning I installed Logitech software - computer lost all sound. After several hours of trying to correct using L software (which did not work for other key/mouse functions either) I finally gave up and had to do a full system restore to remove L software and reinstall the old hp keyboard/mouse! Then I just hooked up L key/mouse as I did at first and did not install L software. So now I have a partially useful key/mouse. I of course can not use all the bells and whistles claimed by L and apparently will not be able to until L issues an updated software program which will be compatible with Vista. WHAT A HASSLE AND TERRIBLE MISREPRESENTATION BY LOGITECH ABOUT VISTA COMPATIBILITY. BEWARE
4,Logitech Cordless Desktop MX3200 Laser,Overall a great product ... but if you are running Windows Vista you might have issues with installing the software for this Keyboard and mouse. I had been online with logiteh several timmes and still can't run the software. ( It knocks out my audio for some reason and I have to do a system restore to get it back ) I was supose to get a call back from level 2 tech support on resolving this issue and 3 weeks later I still have not heard back.
4,Better than expected,This keyboard has a good feel and the laser mouse is very accurate. The only issues are the keyboard LCD display is hard to view in low light and the range using the USB transmitter is somewhat limited. Other than these minor issues I would highly recommend this as a wireless keyboard for use with a desktop or laptop.
4,Good Product,"I went with this keyboard after reading about the connection problems people were having with bluetooth devices. I haven't had any connection problems with this keyboard or mouse with my Dell notebook (Windows XP Pro). I remember thinking the VOIP keys were cool, but they don't work with Skype, which is what I use. I like the ""forward"" and ""back"" key shortcuts being on the mouse. I wish there was a copy and paste on the mouse as well. Overall, I am very happy with these devices. Less cords is better. The battery maintenance is minimal. I use rechargeable NiMH in the mouse (but I haven't had to charge them yet - one month so far), and regular alkaline batteries in the keyboard. The only nuisance is that the ""zoom"" slider on the left side of the keyboard is very sensitive, and a piece of paper or something lying on it can make what I'm reading zoom out of visibility in a half-second."
2,good at first,"at first the product was great, however after a month i have started having connection issues. i keep having to manually connect it through the connection wizard. sometimes it takes 2 or 3 times before it works.the keyboard is very comfortable but the mouse is a little awkward."
5,Great keyboard and mouse,"I liked this so much at home, where I've used it for several months, that I bought it again to use at work. It's comfortable, with good battery life and wireless range.About me - I spend a lot of hours on computers each day, have small hands, and never learned to type properly."
5,Logitech Cordless Desktop MX3200 Laser,Great product and price. The keyboard is very quiet and smooth to type on and the mouse is great. ( I wish it was as big as the MX 1000). Functions and quick keys are great. Long battery life.
4,Logitec MX3200 Keyboard and Mouse,"Works very well. The only thing that could be improved is that they could have included a instruction manual instead of having to look everything up on the installaton disk and make your own hard copies. I it wasn't for that I would have rated it higher.When people buy a new car, they may Know how to drive but they still need to know how to use all the new gadgets and for that they still give you an instuction manual."
2,Awful keyboard,"1) PageUp/PageDown buttons are not where they should be2) F-keys are too small3) Insert key is in the wrong place and too small4) Right Ctrl button is not aligned with the right Shift (very hard to use them as a switch trigger)5) Keyboard makes buzzing noisesThis keyboard is a fancy looking piece of junk. If you want to keep typing without looking at the keys and swearing all the time - stay out.Mouse is good, so 2 starts."
2,it's not very useful when the distance is a little further.,"I prefer wire mouse. when I use the wireless mouse, it's not going very smoothly."
3,"Nice taste, but do not expect Mostarda","I love mostarda, and I was very excited when I found this product--however it has nothing to do with the Italian mostarda eaten in Northern Italy. This one has the consistency of a jelly and does not even come close to the texture of mostarda. The taste is nice though, so if you are looking for something to pair with cheeses go for it, but if you are looking for traditional mostarda then I do not recommend this product."
2,Different from the Renaissance 600 Thread Count 100% Cotton Sateen Sheet Set,"I'd bought the Renaissance 600 Thread Count 100% Cotton Sateen Sheet Set and needed an extra set of pillowcases. These are branded and labeled exactly the same, but they are a different fabric (thinner than the sheets) and a different size (about an inch shorter) from the ones that come with the full queen set. Very disappointing and misleading. Amazon should hold this seller accountable for this disparity. Waste of my time."
2,What gives?,"I ordered the ivory sheet set and then ordered an extra set of the ivory pillow cases. The colors are not the same. The pillow case set is a much lighter color than the sheet set. They are almost white. Way to go, Renaissance!"
2,Not soft at all,"When I opened packaging they felt very soft but after I washed them, they felt more like cheap 200 count sheets you can get at Walmart."
1,Read this before you buy!,"I received a set of these pillow cases and also the sheet set for an early Christmas gift. I thought 600 thread count would mean they were high quality and soft! While the stitching is good, and the fabric is thick, the sheets tecture feel like sand paper! For the price, I expected a good quality sheet set. I washed and dried them yesterday and used them last night and they felt terrible!!! Do not buy these sheets - or you will be shipping them back to amazon like I will be."
1,"Rough, scratchy, unconfortable","The material is extremely scratchy and unconfortable, even after repeated washings. Apparently, the high threadcount did not translate into the advertised softness. To make things worse, the sheets come out of the dryer extremely wrinkled."
2,If you MUST order these pillowcases...,"Do NOT order more than one set- the colors will not match.I was very disappointed when I ordered 4 pillowcases (all at the same time) and the two sets did not match. Two of my cases are more of a red/brown while the other two are closer to a yellow/brown. I would prefer they were actually more different, but the colors almost passing for matching (but not quite) is very annoying.Not only were the colors off (and not very well represented in the picture) they are not soft and they are very wrinkled, even right out of the dryer. I suppose if you have time to iron your pillowcases, which I've never had to do in my life, this is not as much of a problem.All in all this is quite an awful product. They cover my pillows and are sized correctly so I will make due, but I would never purchase these again and I would strongly discourage anyone else from buying them at all.I will try to include a picture of the mis-matched colors if I can figure out how to."
3,Misleading Photo,"The Photo shows a tan sheets with brown pillows ""NO"" really they are both pumpkin orangeBe aware if ordering this product the sheets are nice good for the money if that color is ok .I sent mine back."
5,Wonderful pillow cases!,"You can't go wrong with 600+ count cotton sheets and pillow cases. They just get softer with each wash and feel amazing. This is a great price, and I highly recommend snagging these on clearance before they're all gone! A++++"
3,Deceptive Product,"One set (I purchased two) is wonderful and of GREAT QUALITY and the other is poor. I wish I has received both sets of the same GREAT QUALITY but unfortunately I didn't. I don't really understand why the difference, but there is definitely a difference in quality of the fabric used to manufacture the product."
2,bad quality,"when I received them , they had threads hanging, that I needed to cut, it had a defect in the embroidery, simply poor quality...."
5,Softest sheet EVER!,"I am not kidding when I say that these are the softest sheets I have EVER owned. So smooth and comfy, I want to stay in bed all day!"
2,Different Color than Sheet Set,"Bought king-size pillow cases in cafe to match the cafe sheet set I had bought three months previously. They do not match, are much brighter."
3,Poetry from the Heart,"I would like to say that Dink's Poetry is a book to read to your children or to buy for your teenagers. This book has poems that talk about real life and the influences on todays teens and adults alike. There are inspirational poems for those that are feeling down. The best of Dink's Poetry is that all proceeds from this book goes towards a project called M.A.R.C.S. that helps bury people killed from murder,abuse, rape, chronically ill, suicide. The Author will be on WRTV Channel 6 June 18, 2004 at 6:00 pm. Dink is a real person with a mission to help others."
3,No Opinion,"Nobody knows anything, or if they do, they are careful to hide the fact; in an evolving universe, everything is becoming more intelligent. The unintelligent do not survive."
1,NOT by the author,"I was fortunate in that I didn't buy this. It was borrowed from a friend who was in NO RUSH to get it back. Now I know why.Let me save you all some time: read all the reviews here. I was stunned by the praising ones until I noticed that just about all are written by this Tulbure himself. Pretty sad.The book is sadder. Amateur city. Terrible writing, adolescent 'logic', no scholarship. The Illuminati should sue."
1,No Star,"When an author writes a book he usually has something to share with his Readers. Not so our illuminati. Their noble Grand Master offers us nothing then half of the bible and hundreds of new laws, directives and protocols. Should you await the new ABIMAN REZON or at least something intelligent or useful then surf further please..The intelligence of the writer is awful and his book is useless. When Tulbure is the best they got then this is an useless organization.A. Weishaupt"
1,Fascinating!,Sounds suspiciously like a book Mr. Spock would write. It reminded me of new and ghastly ideas: social Drawinism and Bushism.
1,rude nonsense as enlightened thinking?,"This book points to a problem online book dealers need to address: how many beautiful reviews can an author put up about his own work? In reading the 5 star ones here you notice the same way of saying something, over-the-top and adolescent, and the same spelling mistakes.For the record I read this. It is in every way a badly written book. Talbure even writes his own reviews with a little more skill!"
2,If this is their official manifesto god help us all!,"Don't let the book fool you. It's description of a ""new moral agenda"" complete with constitution and a bit about their forays into ""quantum level vibrational mind control"" reads like a thinly veiled and poorly written press release.In a nutshell they reject god and man is placed in the center of his/her own world. Puh-lease, if Objectivism is the best these guys can come up with to get people lined up we might be waiting for a one world order system for a long long time.Read some David Icke if you need a strategy rebuttal, some Chomsky / Vidal for a tactical rebuttal or Bryce Taylor for some Illuminati horror stories.Remeber all we need is 15% to win!"
1,Grammarians and other thinkers beware,"For some unknown reason, this book was not turned over to a competent copyeditor prior to publication. The lack of copyediting shows from the very first page, and continues. Forget about the illusion of objectivism, which one either buys into or recognizes as the sham that it is. Forget about the militant atheism, again which one either buys into or recognizes as the sham that it is. The fact remains that this book is one of the most poorly written and poorly edited works that I have ever seen outside of a college remedial English class attempts to write a coherent paragraph. Surely, the Illuminati, if such exist, could have found a better spokesperson than Solomon Tulbure. One can excuse Mr. Tulbure's inability to handle English, an adopted language for him. One can not excuse the publisher's failure to provide his with a copyeditor."
1,Zero stars,"I've always been interested in Rand and her objectivism. So I bought this. Big mistake.There's nothing here but childish enthusiasm. You find you doubt even the ideas you were beginning to consider when they are presented in this 'high school paper' light.Serious students - go elsewhere! If you don't believe me, the adoring reviews here obviously penned by the writer of this mess should tell you something."

5,"VERY deep book! A MUST READ, PURE AND SIMPLE!",Wonderful reading. I can't believe I have been so blind! I hope every person on earth reads this book. If you are looking for mind stimulation this book is a MUST READ!Thank you so much for giving my life a new meaning and purpose!
5,An eye opener,"I don't see how anyone in their right mind would bash this book unless they are communists, socialists or Christians.Mr. Tulbure's book is indeed the work of an enlightened man. After reading this book my eyes were opened and my mind started to understand what is so wrong with the world!The ""human infaltion"" issue made so much sense to me I got tears in my eyes from realizing how true it is.Thank you sir for helping me become enlightened and for introducing me to Practical Objectivism."
1,This will not change your life.,"The Illuminati Manifesto will surely open every reader's eyes as to the fact that just about anyone can get published today. Don't waste your money and even more so, don't waste your time."
1,"So HORRIBLE, its tough to even finish it","Let me start by saying I am NOT a Christian (used to be but then I grew up). So this review is unbiased in that regard.Tulbure writes like a bitter 17 year old who failed high school English. Just awful! And yet, he considers himself a genuis and if you don't agree he'll tell you your just too stupid to know.He bashes religion but conveniently leaves out the mass of evidence that much of religion was influenced, if not outright controlled, by the Illuminati as they use it to control, manipulate, and play one side against the other (just like today in the mideast). You'll have to read other books for this info because its not in here (David Icke for example).This book is a waste of time. And the positive reviews posted here? Funny, but they all have the same writing style as Tulbure. Hmmmmmm..."
1,What a POS!!!! Negative 10 stars!,"Anyone who am write a positive review of this garbage am obviously never read the book. Me suspect that Mr. IlluminatiOrderNews am write every single positive statement.Mis-spellings and moronic ramblings am abound in this. Me didn't buy this book, me found it in the garbage. Me almost died laughing trying to read it.It am now being put to good use in me bathroom. So far me used 100 pages. Me sure the people at the sewage treatment plant am enjoying the book though."
3,The Editorial Review of The Illuminati Manifesto,"The editorial review of this book is so poorly written that I wouldn't trust its judgment on the book itself. Does no one edit these editorial reviews? Punctuation errors, usage errors, and using the wrong word (resolve for resort, for example) make me shudder at the quality of your editors."
2,The Illuminati can't spell!,"Spare yourself some money and time and don't bother with this book. The author is obviously just attempting to cash in on the the public's curiousity about the Illuminati.This book is written at approximately an 8th grade level, and has about one mispelling or grammatical error on every page. It's barely even entertaining, since the author's writing is of such poor quality, that he fails to maintain the illusion enough to be plausible.After all, if the Illuminati really are the most intelligent of all human kind and capable of ruling the world from the shadows, they'd certainly know what a run-on sentence is, the proper use of commas, how to click on the spell-check button in Word, or be capable of arguing a point without appearing juvenile or resorting to profanity."
1,'Forth?',"Luckily, I didn't pay for this thing. Got through about five whole pages, though.In a nutshell: it's hard to take seriously anyone who trumpets his mental prowess and can't use a spellcheck. From what I took in before I couldn't hold the book any longer for laughing, this is a long rant from a lonely teenager. That's it."
1,Hopeless drivel,"This is just the kind of thing that ruins an interesting idea. You have a philosophy that offers challenging creeds but in the hands of a 'spokesman' like this, you lose interest in the concept itself.The writer ironically does what many adherents of Christianity do - by putting forth his beliefs so badly, he undermines what he wants to promote. I read half of this before I chucked it, which is a lot. It seems to have been written by a kid no one likes, one who never got over it. The grammar is a joke and the tone is hysterical. They need to have a zero star rating for this kind of garbage."
5,Helpful,"I bought this for a specific section, however the book is highly informative and worthwhile to have for researchers or anyone with an interest in North American archaeology, anthropology or prehistory."
4,From underground to well deserved recognition,"The 2 Skinnee J's newest CD, Super Mercado, truly pulls together their abilities in their genre of fusion/rock/etc.. This CD being their first major record release they improved upon a few tracks from their previous indie album, Return of the New and Improved, and really proved themselves worthy of coming under the public eye. Before this, 2 Skinnee J's were an underground group making their CD's themselves and performing in NY, Philly, Atlantic City, and other places. With this release, which basically displays their intelligent lyrical nature (references to Homer's Odyssey et al) and creative musical style, they will hopefully see that the public wants MORE!"
5,Greatest cd ive heard in a long time,"I downloaded Riot Nrrrd on napster one day, after recalling hearing them live on HBO a while ago. I downloaded, loved it, and then bought the cd. It was even worth the riduculus ""mall price"" of almost 20$. Great songs are wild kingdom, ball point man, youre a champion, 718, riot Nrrrd and organic machine. And if youre in to underground music I also have to recommend Spy who is making big sounds as well."
4,a great new cd,"this is an awsome cd, i heard only two songs and decided to take a chance and get this cd, now it holds a perminate spot in my stereo. this is a great cd and i would recomend it to everyone."
5,Digital Download available directly from the band via 2SJ.com,"Support 2SJ, the band by downloading OFFICIAL 2 Skinnee J's Digital Downloads (all 12 2SJ releases!) available from the Official 2SJ webstore: 2SJ.com!-=AA/2SJ"
5,"Get off 2 Skinnee, get off!","I have seen the 2 Skinne J's on a number of occasions and they are one of the best live bands. This album has got it all, except the Emperial Death March from the first album ""Sing, Earthboy, Sing"". That song is usually the opening number and it gets people dancing from the get go and does not let them stop. If you are in the mood for some great music that blends just about anything then check them out, especially ""Star Wars"" fans."
5,"They are the best live band, and this is an excellent cd.","I was very impressed with this hardcore band after I saw them live. Their music instantly got the mosh pit going, and everyone enjoyed their music, even people who have never heard them before. Overall, this is the only cd of theirs I could find, and like the band, it was all that I hoped for, plus more."
5,Blessed are we who come in the name of J!,"Yo! Anonymous testimonial: Your album rocks! Get off, 2 Skinnee... Now the whole world can enjoy these All-City Champions from 718."
5,These are the J's you're looking for,My favorite cd of all time. They are always coming up with something creative. The greatest thing about this band is that there is no one out there to compare them with. They do their own thing. Buy the cd and go see them live
5,wish list,This item was purchased from a wish list. the only way to shop as I see it they pick it out and you buy it.Happy Happy Happy
4,ernie harwell: stories from my life in baseball,"Mr. Harwell's book consist on many short stories that were printed for the detroit press. Most were very fascinating. Some of the stories he has covered in his other books. ernie makes everyone feel as if they are at the park with him. he is very nice in public when i talked to him about the book. he even took time to autograph the book. all in all, a very good book."
3,"OK quality, but functional","Everything is top quality except the kettle itself. The stainless still is thin and dents easily. It's freakin' chinese made, so you get lesser quality. However, I couldn't find a cheaper pot of similar quality.The burner and strainer are top quality. The kettle came with dents already visible. I've been using it as a brew pot to boil wort and will test it with turkey in a few weeks. However, the BTU output is obviously up to the task.My only problem is the stainless steel in the pot is a tad too thin. I just hate to see ""Made in China"" on anything I buy. I'd rather pay an extra... and read made in USA.Overall, though, I guess it meets my expectations for performance. I mean after all, I didn't buy the damn thing to hang on the wall and show everyone my dent free stainless steel wort kettle. I do wonder if it will last though 10 years, 20-30 turkeys and 500 gallons of beer wort though."
5,A must-have book for any student of Christianity,"I have looked for a long time for a well-written, descriptive yet easy to follow summary of church history.This book is a great introduction to those either studying Christianity or Christians wanting to research the roots and history of Christianity."
2,"Sloppy History, Sloppy Editorials","I was lent this book after finishing J.N.D. Kelly's 'Early Christian Doctrines.' Unfortunately, much of it is a disappointment. I was a little surprised to find how sloppy and broad-stroked Shelley's historical development of Christian history was, especially during the first five centuries: the development of papal doctrine, for instance, occurs much earlier than Shelley concedes in his book. Once the doctrine does develop, Shelley seems obliged to offer unsatisfying counterarguments to the reader - as if the reader were somehow unsettled by a historical development, and needed reassurance. This overall polemical attitude toward Roman Catholicism makes the book read much more like an editorial against it than a history of how it developed among other Christian churches. I would recommend trying a different book that aims to do more straight-forward history, and not historical promotion of one ideology over another."
2,Hard to read,"Surprised by all the good ratings, this book was hard for me to read. The language was ""fluffy"" and wordy and often jumped back and forth from subject to subject. Being brand new to Church History, this book was difficult to read."
5,Bringing to life a long history.,"I was a bit daunted by the shear size of this book, but it turned out to be a fascinating read that I thoroughly enjoyed! It takes the reader throughout the ages, from the disciples to modern times. As a fairly new Christian, it filled in many of the blanks for me....such as who came before us, what struggles has the church encountered.....even simple questions such asWhat is Church? or Where did all the denominations come from. Shelley did a wonderful job of bringing to life many of the characters. There were times I cried, times I was so proud of our forefathers and times I hung my head. Two things that struck me: 1. How many times we repeat ourselves....repeat mistakes. 2. How one single man can make a significant impact on history and the church when it is God's will. Thank God for his grace and mercy. Thank God for men willing to sacrifice. Thank God for loving me and you :)"
4,A history book that is enjoyable!,"I have been enjoying Shelley's Church History in Plain Language. Like most people's comments, I agree with their assessments that it is an easy-to-read book and very enjoyable, too. The author draws the reader into each new chapter. However, I was very much disappointed that there contains no index which might point specifically to where one can find information pertaining to the Apostle's Creed, or information on Gnostics, ... You have to search out which section of the book your topic/person/event/movement/word, ... might be located and then hunt or read each page in order to pinpoint the subject you were interested in researching. Very time-consuming!! Why on earth a good book would waste the opportunity to include a good specific index on each minor/major topic (written about in the book) befuddles me!"
4,"Great History book, but dismisses Orthodox","Its a great book to learn about our past, but I have to say I wasn't impressed by his write up on Orthodox christians. He basicly said they turn to pagan churchs (all gold and icons) and left it like that. The Orthodox church is equal to the catholic and should of been more fully added. There are many wonderfull people and things about the Orthodox Church that should of been added. Also, he doesn't talk about the Byzantine Catholic at all (I can't remember, but it has been 6+months since i read it). The Byzantine empire was truly a holy city built for Christ, something that has never happend since. Untill the Turks and Catholics saked the place and left it defeated about more then 1000 years of being around. They deserve more room in the book, not just a passing remark."
4,CHURCH HISTORY ROCKS! Couldn't put it down!,"This book is easy to read and captivating. Shelley does a remarkable job of explaining Christianity from it's humble beginning to it's present state in a clear concise manner that isn't bogged down in details. The history is told in story form and you can almost watch it unfold. It can ocasionally get confusing because the book doesn't always correspond to a timeline. Rather, it concentrates more on the individual stories and in doing so makes the book much more enjoyable. I enjoyed the way Shelley introduced different ages in church history and presented problems that the church has faced throughout time as well as some issues that we are still coming to grips with today. The personal stories are vivid and captivating and it really does help to explain a lot of rituals and reasons behind a lot of the whys most Christians have today about the church."
1,Dreadful,"Bad history, bad theology, bad everything. Please do not waste your time on this book. Reads modern evangelical creedalism, separatism, and paranoia directly onto past eras of Christianity with no support. There are so many good books on Christian History. Go find one of those."
1,Terribly misinforming...,The author fails to realize that the history of the Christian Church begins and ends with Orthodoxy. Don't get this book.
3,A book I've enjoyed reading every time!,"As a commited Christian I was pleased to see the author's objective stand on potentially divisive issues, while maintaining an attitude of reverence. His easy-to-read style in short, in-depth accounts of persons and events, and additional sources for more in-depth study have made this book a valuable addition to my library. I strongly encourage every Christian who wishes to learn more of the Church's past, it's place in the present, and where it's going in the future to look into this volume."
5,Excellent Overview of Church History,"I am reading this book in concert with a Church History course. The book provides a solid overview of over 2,000 years of history of the Christian Church. It does an excellent job of highlighting the key movements and failures throughout that history. The book is easy to read and does not require an advance understanding of the topic. I would recommend it for any lay person seeking to understand the changes that have occurred in the Christian church since the Book of Acts was written."
3,Actually three stars and a half!!!,"I got a little bit disappointment after I opened it.First, they should write down the names of the manualsNot just Fm-xxI think seldom people could remember the title of each manualUnless he is working for the TRADOC.Next, they stuff something like Fm 7-7""Mechanize infantry platoon and suqad"" in this SPEC OP manual.Did they out of their minds?And something like Nuclear Op/NBC Recon are NOT REALLY RELATEDto SPEC OPs.Why don`t they put something like EOD in this manual?If anyone got enough bandwidth, just go to TRADOC Libraryand download those manuals..."
2,Not the Most Stable - Mini-CD Drivers Only,"Like others, I've had issues with this wireless adapter keeping its connection. About once a week you'll need to remove it from your computer and plug it back in to get a connection. Additionally, this product comes with a mini-CD to install the drivers. Keep this in mind if you have a slot load CD drive as it will not work!"
2,weak reception,"My old Netgear dongle broke so I bought this as replacement for my IBM laptop. It runs very hot. While it stay connected to my Verizon FiOS router, it keep complaining about the weak signal and won't load the web pages."
4,854 usb dongle,"very good item, shipping was fast, but this piece gets very hot after a few hours of use."
5,FAST and EASY,"Fixing up an old laptop for a friend. No wireless capability. Ordered one of these due to the price being not too high.Had no problems installing it and it worked right off the bat. She is thrilled with her ""new"" computer and the CNET wireless adapter.Also I love the extra joint extension that comes with it. It allows you to rotate the adapter to different angles if there are space issues."
3,Gives good connection when it stays connected,"I have had this product for a few months and when I am on the computer and the connection is good, I am happy. Apparently when I am away during the day, the connection is constantly going down and the adapter gets really hot. I sometimes have to unplug and replug to get the connection back up."
2,Not everything I'd hoped for ...,"After sleeping on this brand at a major hotel chain that we stay at regularly on business, I had to have them. I checked the chain's Website and learned that this is the brand they use. The one's I purchased are clearly not the same as what was at the hotel.They start out nice and fluffy but by morning you'll find all the ""fluff"" has shifted and your head is in the hole. Though they do fluff nicely they just don't maintain their shape.If you're looking for a pillow that is soft, fluffy and maintains it's shape through the night, this is definitely not it."
1,Down alternative pillow,There is no down pillow I have slept on that felt like this pillow. The fossfil is hard as a rock and does not conform to the shape of your head as a real down pillow would.
4,Quick and effective,"I love this product and it arrived super quick (within 2 days of ordering)It works best the longer you can leave it on, but it does dry out your mouth."
1,bogus,they sent the package in a an envelope when it should've been sent in a box. by the time i received the package....the (envelope) was torn open and what i ordered was gone! so bottom line i didn't receive anything but an envelope. they should take better care of their customers and spend the extra 50 cents to send their products in a box!!!
5,Great product!,This is an excellent teeth whitener. Our whole family uses it and it works very well.
2,"Works great, but OUCH!","OUCH! Literally, the MOST intense pain that I have ever experienced. As irrational as it may sound, I'd trade for a broken arm at times when the pain was beyond excruciating.The gel itself definitely does a good job (actually, a great job) whitening your teeth - no question. However, it comes at a high price - pain, pain, and more pain. Initially, I was under the impression that the pain would go away. When I woke up, the pain was even more agonizing. No, wait... I didn't have to wake up! I never fell asleep.I have semi-sensitive teeth - really nothing out of the ordinary. I would not recommend this product, UNLESS you plan on taking some sort of a pain killer prior to its use. That, or some morphine - I am NOT kidding. Currently, I am stuck with 8 unused surringes, so I'm seriously considering my own proposal.These are 20% peroxide, which may explain the extreme discomfort. Perhaps the 15% (or less) will hurt less."
1,Shipping costs are way out of line,"I have no problem with the product or the price. However, this seller clearly makes their profit on the shipping costs. I was charged nearly $10 for shipping this product which is way out of line given the product size and weight. I ordered to large boxes of Crest White Strips that are each at least 4 times as large as this one package of whitening gel. The two boxes of white strips was under $4 total (for both boxes) as compared to nearly $10 for one small package from this seller.I contacted the seller about their shipping fees...they never responded.Good product, however, I would look elsewhere for a company to purchase from."
2,Not the results I was hoping for,"Bottom line is I did not achieve the whitening results I had expected. I experienced some mild irritation, but nothing bad during some applications. My dentist told me I would have sensitivity to hot and cold, but I didn't. Overall though the product was supposed to whiten my teeth and it did a little bit, but just not as good as expected. My dentist told me I probably wouldn't use all 8 syringes. I did and am now considering trying a different product with these trays."
1,STABBING PAIN,"I'm using the 15% - my dentist dropped me down to 15 from 20 because I went back after the first night with stabbing pain in one of my teeth. Stabbing has not gone away (it's weird, I wear the trays overnight and am awakened by a stab around 7 or 8 am.) It recurs somewhat during the day randomly, and is also bad when the teeth are exposed to cold. I would stop using it, but my teeth are not whitening evenly - only the bottoms (part near the gumline is darker.)I skipped a night after doing it 2 nights in a row, but tried it again last night and this morning - STAB. (That was after taking 1/2 a Vicodin as a precaution, last night.)This is NOT WORTH IT. I have had 2 stabbing pains in the time it took me to write this."
4,Good Stuff,"I had been using Nupro Gold per my dentist office for about 5 years. I have the custom trays my dentist office created. When I ran out and contacted my dentist, they told me that they switched to Opalescence because they felt it was a better product -- so, I jumped online to find a good price for it (my dentist office was charging like 50 bucks for 4 tubes).I just used this product last week and its good. When I used Nupro Gold I could tell a difference in the shade of my teeth the very first day. With this product it took about two days. It definitely tastes better than Nupro (not that I eat it but sometimes there may be a little too much in the tray).It is gentle on my sensitive teeth which is definitely a plus. You cant beat the price on Amazon. All in all, this product gets two thumbs up from me."
1,Make my teeth very very sensitive,"I tried this product, but it got my teeth feel uncomfortable for the first couple days ( I used this every other day). Up to the third time, I couldn't stand it. My teeth feel very very sensitive after a few hours. Maybe it is just for me, but I had a very bad experience with this product. I suggest people to be careful when they use it. Stop it right away when you don't feel very well."
3,Too weak,I cant devote enough time to wear the 10% long enough to do any good. I get the 35% and use that for much shorter periods of time.
5,Pearly Whites,"Opalescense PF 20% Teeth Whitening is the Greatest Product. It brings your teeth back to Pearly Whites. I went down two shades within two weeks time. I will use it always.Denise from East Islip, New York"
2,"Shaken, not Thrilled","Two words came to mind after finishing this book: Juvenile and pedestrian. It's not among the worst of its ilk, but Gardner does himself no favors with some of the cheeky side references to Bond's favorite actor (Sean Connery, naturally) and the marathon ""honeymoon"".Given the nature of Scorpius, a megalomaniacal cult leader commanding a legion of former drug addict suicide bombers, and his strange quirks, I would have to wonder whether or not this was originally conceived as a Conan novel that Gardner shoe-horned into the Bond mythos.The whole thing just feels rather shallow and weak, especially when one expects a thrill a chapter in a rollicking adventure. It wasn't the worst novel I've read in a while, but it's nothing particularly memorable neither. I'd recommend readers skip it unless one is a true Bond completist."
5,Reads like Scripture.,"If you are familiar with reading Hindu scriptures, like the Bhagavad Gita, and or the Upanishads, and you enjoyed that, I think that you would enjoy this. The Srimad Bhagavatam reads like a series of essays on proper living. A guide book to spiritual discipline, the over all message of the book is to love and serve the lord. Many of books with in this book are short stories of noble men and there spiritual journeys. The Srimad Bhagavatam is pleasant, uplifting, and inspiring."
3,It's your basic tango,"This is definitely tango, but it tends to become a little monotonous as the CD evolves. It lacks a little more of the tango temperament. A bit dull, but it is tango, nonetheless. And although I missed the classical tango tunes, tango experts may recognise some."
1,No longer relevant,"This book does not apply to Maven 2, the current release of Maven. May be useful concept material but because it doesn't apply to the current version of the software it is not a good ""Developers Notebook"". This book should be pulled from the shelves."
2,Out of date,"While there is nothing technically wrong about this book, Maven 2 is almost a complete re-write of Maven. This book covers all the ins and outs of using Maven (the project model, dependency resolution, directory hierarchy), but the technical details are now completely out of date."
3,Out of date,The only full Maven book but falls short on being a good book. The book covers the older Maven version. I would rather wait for version 2.0 coverage than buy an out dated book.
1,superseded by Part II of Maven: The Definitive Guide,"from Maven: The Definitive Guide ""In part II, we're preserving the narrative progression of a ""Developer's Notebook""; it is valuable material that helps people learn Maven by example..."". So if you're looking for a more current version of this book you should buy Maven: The Definitive Guide."
2,"Started out promising, but now woefully out of date","This book started out promising, but shortly into Chapter 1, I knew I was in trouble when it mentioned Maven 2 is ""coming"". Maven's current (major) version is 3. Not shortly after, it gives an example that doesn't work, and there I gave up. For technical subjects, up-to-date information is a must, and this book isn't it. While the writing is clear and readable, the information is so out of date that it isn't worthwhile. I would love to see a rewrite of this book for the current (major) version of Maven. Maven is such a huge and complex subject that a book with relevant information would be welcome. But, this version, as it stands, isn't worth even more than a glance past its Preface."
1,Great stuff except,This is a wonderful book except for the dustcover defect that makes it look rippled.
4,Chi Limited Edition Bling,"I was pleased with the packaging, shipping and the appearance of the product. However, the bling chi iron does not seem to straighten as easily as the original black one. My daughter who is a hairdresser says she has found the original ones to work best also. But overall I am very pleased."
4,Shug's on the Set,"One of my favorite Gang Starr records, F.A.L.A., features the long time associate of Primo & Guru. Now his solo debut. Not exceptional or profound, but an above average first album mainly due to the sick production attributed to Premier. It's noteworthy to think of how much money Premier passed up by not selling these beats to some whack rappers. That is the classic Gang Starr integrity that will leave an indelible mark on hip-hop.Shug's lyrics and delivery match the production on nearly every song and they generally flow together quite well. Some may tire of 20 straight Shug records, but his flow is not half as monotonous as Guru's, and those records are tireless. A definite for a production fiend, and Gang Starr fans who enjoy a harder edge to the lyrics."
2,why? preemo why?,"1st of all i am a hardcore REAL hip hop fan.ok.here we go...i know he has other production on his album but when premier gives you a track(s)you have to be a god on the mic.big shug tries but he fails as an mc.all through the album he talks about the same thing,and for all that gun talk he KNOWS he does none of that,if he did he would have BEEN in jail.its just entertainment and he's a straight up studio gangster.now as for his rhyming style and rhymes he sounds like someone who's 10yrs old trying to rap.very simple and no substance to his rhymes.what's also funny is that his OWN rhyme partners outshine him on the album.shug i know this is your 1st album but the only thing i was looking forward to was preemo's beats.im scared to get the rest of your albums.and to dj premier:STOP WASTING THOSE PHAT BEATS!!!!!!(you also did that on the group home's 1st album).if anybody agrees give me some feedback.peace!"
5,highly remarkable,"Recordings of Ellington's great concert are available of himself, of Louie Bellson and Claude Bolling. Bolling is the only one of them who even recorded the third part of the concert very lovely. Therefore he deserves the maximum number of stars. He has proved that Black, Brown & Beige is a reperformable piece of America's best jazz as well as it's part of America's great classical music.Uwe Kulick"
3,Creates an atmosphere better than a sense of purpose,"Joyce said that the idea of Ulysses was that if Dublin were to be destroyed it could be recreated from his book; Colm Tobin appears to be trying to do the same thing in this book for the Irish family. I'm in two minds about this. The observation is very precise, everything in it rings true, and it evokes the Ireland of 1990 (when not everyone had a mobile phone) so exactly that it feels like a perfectly done period piece. And the final exchanges between the lead character and her mother are perfectly pitched. On the other hand it all seems a bit inconsequential. It held my attention well after the first 70 or so pages and then it was over."
1,"Boring, boring and more boring","I can't imagine why anyone would want to publish this book and am astonished that it was short-listed for the Booker prize. It consists of page after page of details in the life of a sick man - how many times he is sick, soils himself, goes to the bathroom, while the rest of the family prepare and eat meals and drink endless cups of tea. The characters are weakly depicted and not at all believable - this author has no idea about the inner workings of the female mind. A complete waste of my time - there are thousands of books better than this!"
2,Blackwater Lightship,"Just what the world needs, another book about a gay man dying of AIDS. As hungry as I am for works by gay authors, or with good positive gay characters, I'm sick to death of this dying theme. I wish there were authors, or publishers who were original enough to realize that gay men do other things besides die of AIDS. This is a fine author, and the book is well written, and I'm really glad to see that attitudes in Ireland are changing, but couldn't he have chosen some other way of showing that than to have the guy die of AIDS. Perhaps even to have found a friend and having had his family embrace his gayness in living rather than dying? If you are not as sick of this theme as I am, then this is a fine book."
2,Flat,"Yet another over-hyped novel. This reads more like the screenplay for a chick flick than serious literature. A series of shallow characters are thrown together in - what seems to me - a plot device to enable the novelist to convey his ideas about the problems of gay people and/or HIV positive people in the Ireland of 90s. The opening chapters are completely unrelated to the rest of the story and the strife between the three generations of women is utterly trivial. While I admit that, between family members, the most trivial of problems can result in bitter separations, the reasons behind the rift between Helen, her mother and her grandmother are laughable. The writer tries to inject some warmth into story by constant references to the cats and gossipy people of the town but it is as artificial as the dialogue between the characters. I had great difficulty trudging trough this book. I am amazed that it has been shortlisted for any award."
5,Magnificent & graceful,"Helen's brother Declan is dying of AIDS. Together with their mother, their grandmother, and 2 friends of Declan's, she takes care of Declan in what might be his final days. These 6 separate worlds collide into and reconfigure the estrangements of the past years. Toibin's potent rendering of these people coming to terms with themselves and each other is incredibly moving and highly evocative. He skilfully shows the power personal stories have on healing rifts between people. This is one of the most beautiful novels I've read this year."
4,Strengths and Weaknesses,"I got my Earthball at Ecotoys in Italy and use it in workshops that I run around the world. I find it interesting how rough some people can be with it, and it has, as a result, already suffered some damage, springing a leak in the Indian Ocean, and the stopvalve has been torn making if more difficult to empty it of air to carry it to a next location.Nevertheless I find it is an excellent way for visualising our Earth in July (from the clouds, that is what season it is). I would dearly like to include them in the kits we are setting up for trainers of the Dragon Dreaming method.Perhaps people just need to learn that the Earth is not a football! A good lesson for our environmentally challenged age."
4,Earth Ball,"We used this for our church V.B.S ...if they could possibly make it in larger sizes, we would have gone to a larger one. Thanks"
3,Valve won't stay closed!,"I have tried repeatedly to get the valve to stay closed, but it keeps opening back up and letting the air out. A blow up ball isn't very useful if you can't actually keep air in it."
4,"Good, Funny CD - But the Price?","A fine, funny Mull CD, not as good as ""Everyone I've Ever Loved,"" but a good approximation of one of his live shows. Clever, dry humor with some great bits - Dueling Tubas, Ukelele Blues -- and funny commentary in between. If you like Mull chances are you'll like this. But beware the price on used versions. This is currently availabe (May 2006) for download on iTunes -- which is a lot cheaper than the $70 I've seen elsewhere. Shop around before paying scalper rates."
3,MP3 tags need work,"Nice to have this album available cheaply, but the tags on the MP3s cause the files to show up under two different Artists. Some tracks are by Martin Mull, others (the spoken ones) are by Fabulous Furniture. The person who created these files apparently had some fun with that, but may be confusing or annoying when someone downloads the files and then tries to find them in a music library (like iTunes)."
5,"Maple lovers, these are delicious!","I really love maple syrup, and I bought some of these while in Montreal and really loved them. So happy to find them here to order more. They aren't creamy like traditional fudge, but are more like soft maple sugar candy. Fresh, real pure maple flavor melts in your mouth. ED Foods notified me by email after ordering that there was extra shipping time coming from Canada, but I still received them in less than 10 days. Individually wrapped pieces keeps them nice and fresh."
1,Disappointed,I did not receive this item. It could not be delivered in a timely manner. I was given the option of paying extra postage (totalling more than the item) or a refund of my money. I took the refund.
4,Getting the maximum benefit from your most powerful asset - your people...,"It's a tricky balance - do you commit resources to shore up organizational weaknesses or use those scarce allocations to maximize organizational strengths? The authors of the book ""Play to Your Strengths"" clearly support the latter strategy especially regarding human capital. Soundview recommends this book because it places a high value on the individuals within an organization and their skills which - more often than not - are the truly unique competitive advantage of the company. The writers' fresh perspective of managing human capital should enable any business, agency or non-for-profit to fully engage their most powerful asset to their maximum benefit."
4,Transport Folding Lightweight wheel Chair,It is very convenient. You can easily put it in the car. very easy to manouver. I'm happy I bought this for my mom. We can now easily go to places and shopping!!!
1,Not reliable,I do not like this wheelchair because it is not a self transport. The wheels are not large enough. The footrests is sketchy and uncomfortable.
5,Great chair,This is a great lightweight chair and the price was great also. I recommend it to anyone that is looking for a inexpensive chair that doesn't weight alot.
3,Wheel Chair,"The Product came on time as promised, Just a little cheaply built in China. Do not like the band that keeps the legs together but itotherwise does the job. Seeing how long it will hold up is the issue."
5,wheel chair,"The transport is light weigh, easy to navigate. The seat belt was a added feature that was really needed, but generally found on more expensive chairs. This chair is idea for getting around the house and easy to get in and out the car."
4,Very Nice Wheelchair,"Bought this wheelchair for my 90 year old father. Arrived soon after my order in good, but not perfect condition. The chair is packaged in plastic; and the seat and back had a slight film of mold on them as a result of trapped moisture. Fortunately, the mold came off with just a few swipes of Clorox wipes.The design and materials are very good. However, the instructions are spartan, to say the least. They may as well have not included any.I would not say that this is the finest piece of tooling. Some of the parts had to be pounded and tweaked to fit properly.The hand brakes work well and are really essential for the safety of the passenger. The chair collapses and expands very easily. Still, you need a good sized car trunk for this (or any) chair to easily fit.Okay, the chair is made in China, which is reflected in the tooling and the mold. [...]"
3,"Fun reading, poor editing","The book has an amusing collection of anecdotes and figures, and I recommend it for some light reading.But I am surprised by the poor editing. For example, the book insists on using both metric and imperial measurement, which is good, but sometimes the numbers are just plain wrong.For example, on page 96, it says average double beds are 1.8 metres (or 6'2"") long. That would be about 5'11"".Elsewhere, there are some possibly interesting facts, like the work statistics in Europe on page 78, but no source is mentioned, it just says ""statistics show that...""And, in the same page, France is missing from the list of European states.All in all, makes for a relaxed afternoon, but I would not take anything too seriously.Oh, according to the author, the Euro is not ""proper money"" like the UK pound or the US dollar (page 120). British snobbery?"
2,If you read this from cover to cover;I'd be surprised.,"I often pick up books of facts like this and generally find them pretty good.However;in this case I was disappointed.There was some stuff I found interesting and novel;but generally I found most of it rather mundane.Also,this book is heavily weighted with British and european facts and data that at the most only makes you wonder about North America.That is not to say that it is completely void of anything in North america,but it is quite sparse.As I read the book,I found that many,even most,subjects were of little interest to me,hence;in many cases once I readthe title ,I simply skipped it.The sub-title of the book,""Facts,Figures And Stories That Make Everyday Life Extraordinary"";is much better at promising than delivering."
3,It was a good start,"Wreslemania 1 was the first of now 15 installments. This is a good look at wrestling before it exploded. Some of the wrestlers were the real pioneers of the sport like Bruno Sammartino and Tito Santana. For the first time, the WWF did a fine job on an excellent evening."
2,okay,THE HOGAN/T VS PIPER/ORNDORFF MATCH WAS NOT BAD BUT THE SLAM MATCH I GIVE 5 STARS FROM BOBBY KLEIN
3,great video to have for historical purposes,"The matches in this 1st wrestlemania are not that great,but it's nice to have for historical purposes since this is the one that started it all.Although it does have Muhammad Ali as a guest referee in on of the matches which adds some flavor to the video."
2,"Too old, can't stay interested","I am one of wrestling's biggest fans and I love the wrestlemania series as much as the next guy, but this event is OLD AND BORING. I guess it's mostly that there was almost no lighting or entrence music and the wrestlers on this tape who still wrestle today are well out of their primes. It is basically an event of future lower mid-carders (ie Tito Santana and King Kong Bundy) being pushed as true superstars. Most fans wont recognise these werstlers because most of them did nothing for the buisness that warrants the remembrance of their names. Its only saving grace is the women's title match."
1,Sorry ass video,a person if they look can tell the wwf home video release is nothing but a dubb from the coliseum video release and Vince McMhan and sony wonder didn't even make the tape in SP mode oh yes it makes a difference. So I stress to the sellers out there if you have the original coliseum video versions sell those those are the quality tapes the wwe is trying to hide. because thats the old WWF.and in my opinion the way Vince McMhan acts he doesn't really like the old WWF or the real set of poeple that helped make him what he is to day.
3,DVD IS BETTER,i have the dvd.the matches r ok but they r super short.the longest match was the womens title match(weird)only buy if u r a wwe/wwf collecter like me:)
3,WWF WrestleMania Review,"This was a good WrestleMania, but it wasn't great. The best match was the main event with Hulk Hogan & Mr. T going against Paul Orndorff & ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper. One thing is for sure, you need to buy this video just to say that you have it. I mean, WrestleMania is the single greatest event in sports-entertainment. This is where it all started. But if you want great wrestling action in a WrestleMania, buy WrestleMania 12. The HeartBreak Kid, Shawn Michaels against Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart. Yeah, I'd buy this video if you're into slow paced matches with a big ending."
3,"For you older than 18, Wrestlemania is for you!","The Main Event between Mr.T/Hogan vs Orndorff/Piper was a classic. The 15,000 dollar slam match between Andre vs Big John Studd was also a classic. I liked the tag team title match as well. Some of the undercards are boring. But it features all-time greats like Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat, Brutis Beefcake, Greg ""The Hammer"" Valentine, Junk Yard Dog, King Kong Bundy, and Tito Santana. This event started something special in the 1980's. If your old school this is for you. If your to young, even though its only 15 years old, and don't care for this stuff, I feel sorry for you. - From the man who tells it like it is"
3,OK Not Great But OK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Vinne Mac's first series in a vison that became the best series in sports entertianment history. The main event is pretty good, but the undercard is very boring. For $12.99 buy the first of the series."
4,Where it all began....,"If your are into old school wrestling from the 80's, this is the tape to buy. Hogan/Mr.T vs. Piper/Orndorff was a great main event which lived up to all the hype. Also, Andre the Giant vs. Big John Studd in the $15,000 slam match as well as the I-C and Tag Team matches are all classics. This tape features such other legends as JunkYard Dog, Greg ""The Hammer Valentine"", Tito Santana, Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat, King Kong Bundy... need I go on? Some of the matches are boring, but all in all this is a great tape."
2,IF YOU DONT APPRECIATE IT YOUR TO YOUNG,"I'm only 19 but I used to watch this and the next 2 wrestlemaina's all the time. It doesnt hold up as well as the other mania's. The main event match is pretty decent. The Andrea Studd match was good, so were the the tag title and IC match. Others wern't as good such as Brutus Beefcake (one of my favs) but he had to carry David ""the gimp"" Samartino. All and all its a must see for any REAL wrestling fan and not just a fan of the WWF freak show these days."
3,i think it was a well wrestlmania with good matches,I thought wrestlemania was a great show. I thought the Junkyard Dog was hilarious in his interview before the match. the best match the 15000 dollar slam match between andre and big john studd
3,The One That Started It All,The main event was great as per usual. The slam match between Andre/Studd was entertaining; but that is all. 2 stars for actual matches since the undercard was pretty poor; but an entire star strictly due to historical significance. The one that started it all!
3,A good first effort.,"WrestleMania I, Madison Square Garden, New York, NY. This is what started it all, the self-proclaimed ""Grand Daddy of Them All!"". As far as actual match quality, this is a kind of slow event. There isn't really a standout match in this event. Hogan & Mr. T are in the main event, so you know it isn't going to be spectacular. Well, that isn't really fair, as the main event is about 1,000,000 times better than it had any right to be. This tape is recommended for sheer historical value, but don't expect to be on the edge of your seat or anything."
2,WRESTLEMANIA,"The first WrestleMania in 1985 set a milsetone for the wrestling business. Although not quite as successful as the later WrestleManias, this first event is worth seeing. Many legendary faces are seen here. Don't miss out on the very first WrestleMania."
3,The one that started it all,"3 stars. The matches don't deserve that. Not at all. But for history there is none better. If you plan on buying WrestleMania 2000 (XVI) this year, buy this first. For history."
2,Disappointing Kickoff for Wrestlemania as We Know It!,"When we think of Wrestlemania, the WWF's grand spectacle of the year is what pops into our heads. This, however, did not resemble that meaning at all. Beginning with a ""jobber"" contest consisting of Tito Santana and ""professional loser"" Playboy Buddy Rose in an Executioner outfit and ending with a lackluster Tag Team contest as a Main Event, it is near guaranteed that you will feel unsatisfied once the video is over. There is not one great match-up in the video, as it is filled with disgustingly boring matches such as Big John Studd vs. Andre the Giant and the 30 second snoozefest pitting King Kong Bundy and ""Special Delivery"" Jones. On the positive side, this event boosted the WWF into what we know it as today: Sports Entertainment. If you would like to purchase a great Wrestlemania, seriously consider Wrestlemania 3, 5, 10,12, or 13."
5,Casio Replacement Label Tape,Was about 1/2 the price of brick and mortar options. Everything went smooth with purchase and delivery. Don't use a lot of this so a single pack option would be nice.
3,wasteful but looks nice,"I bought a casio machine so I am stuck using this tape-I don't want to be wasteful and throw the machine in the landfill. It is difficult to peel the tape from the backing. On other brands you fold the tape in half and it separates from the backing easily on this you have to get an exacto knife , or very sharp fingernails and struggle to get it off.Also, the machine wastes a lot of tape. A good way for them to sell more.If you haven't bought a label machine yet i would think twice about this one. if you have this machine I would keep it or give it away to a school or Martha Stewart fan and get something else."
4,Good value.,Good value. No complaints other than the fact that the tape is difficult to separate from the backing. Works as claimed.
3,Common sense information,"Much of this book covered general good sense and manners, which I suppose can be a problem for some. Television, I think, takes care of manners these days.That said, there were times when I thought to myself, ""Oh, I wish I'd known that before I started my job."" For that reason, these gems are worth looking into, though I am sure there are more useful books on the market."
3,Book of Common Sense,I didn't get very much out of this book as it pretty much sums up a standard I guess I've been aware of for some time and just never paid much attention to. I'm sure others will like this book and may find more use with it. I didn't have it hold my interest or have ever been able to finish it. Guess I'm just not the professional presence type!
2,Nothing New Here,"While the topic is enticing, ""5 Steps to Professional Presence: How to Project Confidence, Competence, and Credibility at Work"", by Susan Bixler and Lisa Scherrer Duga, fails to deliver. The (extremely obvious) tips that are given are fine if one endeavors to be an 'empty suit', as none go to the root of honest and actual confidence, competence, and credibility at work -- all of which require actual knowledge and capability. Skip this one and try one of the 1000s of books out there that can help you achieve your personal and professional goals, such as Stephen Covey's ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" or Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People""."
1,Boring!,"""The People's Playground"" is a major disappointment. This book was billed as a ""new history"" but is nothing more than a tired rehash that reduces coney Island to a boring cliche. The writing is pseudo-academic and stilted. Except for a few notable exceptions, the photographs are archival shots published in previous articles and books. The static design and the muddy photo-reproduction ruin the book's few good photographs. The captions are long-winded and set in all capital letters, making them hard to read. The book looks self-published. Most of the information contained within is gleaned from ""Good Old Coney Island,"" ""Sodom by the Sea,"" and ""Amusing the Million. The author does not present an original idea or insight. What this author doesn't know about Coney Island could fill a book, and that's exactly what he's done."
3,Not Just a Pretty Face,"I just got Michael Immerso's book on Coney Island as a gift to remind me of the excitement and magic I felt when I visited there. I was delighted to get a coffee table book that was not just slick, but edifying as well. I felt justified in this delight as the pictures were given weight by the academic tone of the narrative explanations. Although I hoped for a bit more colorful ""sleeze"" in both the pictures, and the descriptions, nevertheless I'm not disappointed. I feel both my need for visuals as well as story have been satifactorily met."
5,goodwitch,this fryer looks like it can do the job i need and it is sturdy because it is made of stainless steel
4,Insightful introduction,The author introduces complex Kabbalistic principals in an easy to read and understand format. The book is a pleasant reminder of how business should be conducted and how placing others first can transform our lives. Good for newbies.
3,Not good for the Winchester 1300,"This mount may be good for the 870 or other shotgun models but not the Winchester 1300. It uses the ONE pin used to hold in the trigger assembly and then two tiny plates held in with small screws on each side. If you look at the picture, the bottom picture is the Winchester 1300. Notice the one pin on the bottom angle of the mount, on the bottom of the other end are the two plates. They don't screw in all the way and they sit permanently angled on the finished, under-side of the shotgun. After a few rounds I'm sure these plates will move around and scratch your shotgun, if they don't completely fall off.If you want a rail on your Winchester I suggest you have a gunsmith drill and tap holes to attach one; I don't see how any bolt on mount will work for this shotgun."
3,American Farmers are the key to true Organic Farming,"American Farmers are the only farmers in the world, that are under the watchful eye of a Gov't agency. NO chemicals may be sold without a ""Notice of Intent"" which is sent to the local agricultural commissioner of each county. Each noice of intent spells out exactly how and when each chemical is to be used. What other country even monitors chemical use? So, when it comes to true Organic Farming, who do you trust?"
2,I spent how much on this? Damn.,"If you want to admire Henry Rollins' bare behind, watch this movie. Everything else is a waste of time. ""Morgan's Ferry"" is painfully slow and dry, leaving its otherwise talented cast deficient of an engaging plot, believable character relationships or interesting dialogue. The dragging story makes the viewer wish for an explosion, or anything, to make it stop, instead of lumping along into the uneventful end.Also, it is pointless to watch the DVD version, there are virtually no special features; there aren't even chapters, just one long run."
2,"not good quality, only looks good","the towel looks good with bright colors, but quality is not so good. I was looking for a fluffy big towel for my daughter. This towel does not give you any fluffy feeling as all. It is too light and too thin, as thin as a piece of paper. I want to return it, but I can't figure out how since Amazon is not the seller. The package came in from WholesaleDNG without a receipt or a package slip. it's a waste of money."
5,Les malheurs de Sophie - by la Comtesse de Segur,"This book, and all others by the same author, is a must for little girls between the ages of 6 and 11. I enjoyed them when I was a youngster , as did my own mother ! I have three little nieces who are being taught French and we introduced them to this book and others by La Comtesse de Segur..they fell in love too! Written hundreds of years ago, they have lost none of their charm or appeal. Simple stories where good deeds are always rewarded, where children across the ages still acted the same as our children do nowadays (less so though!).A must, a classic of children litterature with none of the stuffiness that might entail!"
1,What a piece of crap!,"I'm not going to waste a lot of time writing about how bad this 'video' is, but someone needs to take the time to put a bell on the rat! This is less a video and more a slide show. It's virtually devoid of information and, unbelievably, it spends more time on places 2 hours from the Lake than it does on the Lake. Don't bother with this. At $1.99 it is WAY over priced!"
2,Misleading,I thought this was going to be the double cd. Instead it was a limited edition and only contained one cd.
