1,"Nice Story, Poorly Written","I rarely write a review before I have completed a text, but am 250 pages into this book and wanted to warn as many others as possible. This book is clearly the weakest of the Sloan Technology Series to date for a number of reasons.The author frequently delves into ridiculous levels of detail about trivial events, and then glazes over larger technical issues. There is no in depth explanation of the chemical and physical explanations which enabled Land to develop Polaroid into a successful company. There is no rhyme or reason to the flow of the text, and it appears largely to follow the thought stream of the notes that the author used to put the text together. There is almost no quality treatment of the business aspects of Polaroid, the author making passing references when it so suits him.This is a very thick book, which is quite laborious to read. Unfortunately, the thickness does not translate into quality, or even quantity, of useful information located within."
3,Excellent bio; great life lessons,The life of Edwin Land contains many life lessons for the entrepreneur who is considering science or technology. It portrays the stick-to-it-iveness he had and how he avoided most of the pitfalls of inventing. His accounts of Land's thin-film polarized filter and other inventions are fascinating and engaging.
1,Incapable of anything longer than a newspaper article,"This book should be a bestseller - to every journalism school as a case study of ""when good journalists become bad authors"". It reads like a collected series of author notes strung badly together. This writer should have never ventured past his skill set.Page after page of detailed notes about chemical and optical process (more than likely lifted straight out of someone's lab notebooks) without a SINGLE diagram. None, zero, zilch. Can you imagine an entire book on Poloroid without a single explanatory diagram?!In a potentially gripping human story there are no insights about the classic American conflict of what happens to an entrepreneur and his company when he misses the next market. No depth of character.I forced myself to finish the book. Learned some interesting outlines of Land's life. It could have be covered in a New Yorker article.Worthwhile bibliography - most of the insights were from these source materials."
3,"Good Exegis, but NOT by one of Jehovah's Witnesses","An excellent literary work; however, Greg Stafford is not one of Jehovah's Witnesses. I want everyone to be clear on this point. He has apostatized Jehovah's Witnesses publicly on the distribution site of his book. If you are one of Jehovah's Witnesses, understand that you are purchasing a book written by an apostate. If you aren't, be clear that he does not actually represent the Watchtower Bible & Tract Society, nor is he one of Jehovah's Witnesses in good standing. Here is a link as proof:http://www.elihubooks.com/data/lampstand/000/000/007/Why_interested_in_JWs_REVISED.pdf"
4,Very Informative But Remain Unconvinced,"After reading the reviews of the book, I was really excited to read the material for myself. After reading the book, I must be frank and honest in admitting that Stafford was enjoyable as well as informative. I could admire his zeal and passion for what he believes to be true. Yet at the same time his arguments in refuting trintiarian theology were for the most part not entirely convincing. I've written a response in relation to some of his major points as well as presenting the evidence for what I believe to be the true biblical christology and am offering it to anyone who's interested free of charge, including Stafford. Hopefully my review with my e-mail will be posted for others to read. He also convinced me not to invest in Ron Rhodes book, with all its hasty generalizations and assumptions. I do look forward to any future works done by Stafford, since his work was informative and enjoyable. And this coming from a Trintarian."
5,This book will be a valuable reference for years to come.,Every time I pick up this book I deepen my understanding of the exegetical issues regarding the translation of Hebrew and Greek into English. This is not a book that can be absorbed all in one reading. I particularly like how the author exposes the faulty reasoning of critics and presents very complex and technical arguments in such a manner that even those who do not have formal training in the original languages of the bible can understand. This book is in some ways almost an intermeadiate Greek grammar of sorts. Outstanding !I highly recommend it.
5,Just what I ordered!,The hat I purchased was for my finickey husband who refuses to wear a hat with logos etc.. It is adjustable and it goes with anything he wears. The delivery time was quicker that what they said. Made paying the large shipping cost worth it.
1,NOT user friendly software,"I bought this software because the software I was using (Creative Photo Albums III) is no longer supported and I was having problems with it on my new computer. My Scrapbook Edition is very difficult to use and I consider myself very computer literate (I write software for a living). I tired to import some clip art from a disk and it came in very tiny. Ok, I can resize it right? Only if I want it to be very blurry. Creative Photo Albums took the same clip art and resized it great. Another problem: The image I was importing was a chess piece. I wanted to place it on top of a border. My Scrapbook Edition would not place just the chess piece but would add a white box around it. Creative Scrapbooks would place just the chess piece. I would not recommend this software to anyone."
1,Returning it tomorrow,"I just got off the phone with a Hobby Lobby manager who thankfully will allow me to exchange this product, which I'm going to do first thing tommorow. Words cannot express how disappointed I am with this product. I did a lot of research to find a package I liked and several reviews gave this one good marks. The only thing I liked was the photo editing features which were pretty limited. (I guess you get what you pay for!)I agree 100 percent with Software User from Tampa. It is difficult to maneuver around in, prints badly and tech support was pretty unhelpful. In addition, after I installed it one of the features (paint/clone) would not work at all, even after I unininstalled and reinstalled. I consider myself a competent, computer literate person, but this system had me pulling my hair out."
4,Not Bad!,"I've just started using this and it's not bad. I did have to read some instructions to find the parts I wanted to use (I hate to read instructions), but so far so good. It is the best scrapbook program out there for the serious scrapbooker."
5,THE BEST SO FAR,"This is amazing stuff. The Minor's bases were recommended to me by one of the instructors at the New Orleans School of Cooking. He used some of the chicken base to make the eight cups of stock he used in a gumbo he was demonstrating. I've tried the beef and the chicken, and both are superb. They have a flavor that is identical to home made stock. The stuff keeps forever. Give any of the Minors bases a try and you will be sold. The only problem is the ridiculous shipping charge from Soupbase, the vendor. It's almost as much as the cost of the product."
5,More taste for less,"Two thing make a great meal, products and prep work !Being an ex chef a great beef base can always be a fantastic 'Go To'and in today's world not everyone has the time to make it from scratchI know I don't !I ALWAYS have a couple on hand as many of my friends want some afterthey've tasted my entrees, soups and sauces and frankly I got tiredof running out. I'd also highly recommend the Chicken base.When you take the time to prepare a meal for family & friendsthe quality of the products you use will always be known whenall is quiet followed by a few burps."
5,Here's the beef!,"I like to cook and this stuff is good. Don't use too much and you should be pleased. It doesn't seem to deteriorate in the fridge. I bought the chicken and vegetable versions, but haven't used them enough to comment yet."
5,absolutely wonderful,the rich flavor this give to meats and sauces is absolutely perfect. just use your imagination and your favorite dishes will be kicked up a notch
5,Eacatly What It Was Supposed To Be,I was very pleased with this purchase. I was exactly what it supposed to be .I would reccomend this to anyone.
3,Masculine and powerful,"Great masculine fragrance that is should be used sparingly. Just a one or two sprays about the chest is, in my opinion, enough to last the evening without being too overpowering."
4,Great Lotion,"This lotion is hard to find in my small town; leaves skin with a ""silky"" feeling unlike any other lotion I've used; absorbs very quickly; has a clean fragrance but may be too fragrant for some; I believe it does come in unscented."
3,Not what I expected.,The scents are very nice but when I purchased these as a gift for my boyfriend I was unaware that they are bath oils not bubble bath (perhaps I mis-read the description) :-( I greatly enjoyed the lemon one.. but yes.. I ended up using them because he'll only use bubble bath.
3,Partial Soundrack lacks one of the best tunes of the movie,"What happened to ""Times a Wastin""? Reese and Joaquin....Why put in Lewis Boogie by Wayne MolloyPayne, and Milk Cow Blues?BTW Joaquin deserved the oscar too just as much as Reese did"
5,Happy customer!,"CD arrived in very good condition and in a timely fashion. There are a couple of seconds of static in between 2 songs but it does not affect playing the CD or any of the cuts. I would use this seller again.Just wish ""Time's a Wastin"" was on the CD and don't understand why it was left out, as it is one of the best songs from the entire movie."
4,Pretty Good,"I thought Joaquinn and Reese did a great job on this soundtrack and I was offended negative reviews. I think Johnny Cash would have been pleased because it introduced his music to a new generation who probably wouldn't have listened to it otherwise. My son has both versions on his Ipod and I can promise you that never would have happened without the movie. Joaquinn is no Johnny Cash but he did a great job. Frankly, I think Reese sounds better than June Carter."
5,Awesome Soundtrack to a wonderful movie,"I've always liked Johnny Cash, but after seeing this movie I am just astounded. I've never really been a 'country' music fan, but the music that this man and his future wife made was so great. Most people my age ( 24) are listening to rock, alternative and rap- which is all fine, but this music just awakened something in me. It's so upbeat even at the lowest of times for Johnny and June. I think Joaquin and Resse did an exceptional job. I saw the movie on Friday, bought the soundtrack on Saturday and I haven't stopped listening to it since. I think I'm driving my fiance and our friends crazy!!!! I would definitely buy this if I didn't have it already!!!~Cori"
3,Liked the soundtracek but didn't love it,Loved the movie! Expected more from the soundtrack -- watching the performances really carries the recreation of the music.
2,Come on,"Sure they are good, considering they are not muscians but come on Whats the point of buying this, when the orginal is so mucb better.They aim to mimic the real artists, so whats new and exciting about it then?"
2,"A for Effort, C for Sound","Phoenix can carry a tune better than Johnny, but he sure can't carry the depth of Johnny's vocal emotion, resonance, and presence. Johnny Cash was an artist that used raw attitude and edge over musical talent and performance gloss. Phoenix's brave portrayal of a flawed yet likeable man was admirable and Oscar worthy. His singing is not. Reese Witherspoon, on the other hand, is not even close to the pure Appalachian soul of June Carter Cash. Goes to prove you can act your way through...to a point. That point ends where the real and honest artistry begins. Nice try, but no 5-star cigar. For music, there's no substitute for the real deal. Buy Johnny and June discs instead."
2,Not the original!!,A Johnny Cash's Greatest Hits would have been better.Reese Witherspoon cannot sing.
1,Walk the Line soundtrack,I am very dissatisfied with this cd. I ordered it because the list of song it was suppose to have on the cd but it does not have them.
4,"Where's ""Time's a Waistin""???","I haven't bought the soundtrack yet but just saw the movie and LOVED Joaquin and Reese's voices in these songs!!! I'm not really into country music but my parents always loved listening to Johnny Cash and I really wanted to see this movie. I can't wait to buy the soundtrack but I rated this a four because I'm disappointed that ""Time's A Waistin'"" isn't on the soundtrack! This song was so cute in the movie!!! I still have this song in my head from the movie and really want Joaquin and Reese's version of it on a C.D.! Even if it was a single I would buy it!!!"
3,i'm torn... this is just acting!,"Okay, first i'm not a Johnny Cash fan. Never was. But i've been a fan of his story way before the movie. I loved the movie. the actors were great. Their voices... blew me away. But HELLLOOO? People.. is it just me but this is kind of weird.. I mean their just actors. This isn't Pheonix baring his heart or his songs... he's pretending to be Johnny Cash... its all sorta insincere to me. Reese Witherspoon doesn't actually sing like that... she's pretending.. Great songs and well done but its hard to take any of this seriously as art. Though Jennings, in my opinion is the real star of this soundtrack. That voice... thats real!"
2,I don't follow...,"*Everybody* loves this film. I don't get it. While I love both main actors, the music is good, and the film is nicely shot, I found it to be pretty much just a story of a man who can't keep his paws out of the cookie box. (Drugs and cheating on his wife.) I tried watching it three times, but finally I just gave up, it just did not hold my interest."
1,Why?,Why would you want to hear actors (however good) impersonating such legendary musicians when you could buy another album and hear the real thing?
1,Looks like I'll have to say it.,The actors could not sing. Reese did a better job of sounding like June than Joaquin did of sounding like Johnny. Joaquin Phoenix's voice is not close to being deep enough to sound like Johnnys. The worst song on the cd is by far I Walk The Line. Joaquin left out the signature HMMMMMMMMMMMM because if he did it then everyone would realize just how little he sounded like Cash.
1,Great CD. Should be 5 stars not 1,I had a problem playing this cd on one of my computers and gave the cd only 1 star. But it plays fine on my other PC and cd player. This will be one of my favorite cd's from now on. Reese and Joaquin really capture the flavor of the Cash/Carter personalities. I enjoy listening to them just as much as June and Johnny themselves.
5,Walk The Line,"Great movie.I would recommend it for any movie fan,but especially Johnny Cash fans.The portrayal of Johnny Cash was terrific.I had to have a repeat.Henry Garcia"
5,Excellent Soundtrack,"The music in this film is going to motivate a lot of people to go back and get Johnny Cash music on various CD's. Phoenix and Weatherspoon do an excellent job at capturing the ups, the downs and the magic of this couple. June never gave up on Johnny and the movie and the music combine to show a musical triumph involving high artistic integrity. What a story....and the music in many cases tells their story.The actors here do a great job of singing and performing. They truly live their parts and deliver a home run in this film!"
3,One disappointment...,"I should have checked the song list before I bought the soundtrack, since the main song I really wanted to hear was the duet btwn. Phoenix and Witherspoon, ""Times a Wastin'"". It's not on the CD! Otherwise the soundtrack is wonderful, though I could do less with the Elvis songs."
5,Wonderful soundtrack to an excellent movie.,"I love this soundtrack, it's a great addition to the movie. You must own both this and Walk The Line. It brings me back to the movie as soon as I hear it. I think they have great voices and I can't say enough about this or the movie."
4,This is pretty good.....,"The music sonds just the same as when the real Johnny sang it. Thats great. BUT, when Reese sings, you know it is her because June Carter had a little growl nobody had. Joaquin sounds just like Johnny Cash. You would enjoy this if you are a fan of Johnny Cash, or if you're a fan of the movie. This woould be a great stocking stuffer for the Christmas holidays his year. Can't wait til' the movie comes out!!!"
3,"Well, they tried.","They get an ""A"" for effort, at least. But a lot of the performances sound like what the real Johnny cash would have sounded like had all his teeth been extracted prior to making the recording. Nice try though, but it just doesn't sound right/authentic.Ivan Rorick"
4,They don't sound like Johnny and June...That's the whole point.,"It's old songs with a fresh sound. Give these guys props for singing them in the first place. Plus, it is a fun CD to listen to. Glad I bought it."
4,Rules!,"I love listening to these versions as much as the orginals. Joaq and Reese sound magnificent! My only complaint it that all of the songs from the film aren't on the soundtrack i.e. ""Times a wastin'"" and ""I got stripes."" Hopefully the film makers will put out a score album with these tracks included."
5,awesome !! ! ! !!,"Joaqin should have won the Oscar, he put all he had into the movie and his singing. Great Job !!"
5,Better than expected!!!,"Have to say this is a great cd! didnt think it would feel the same as johnny and june, but it does come close! very good remake of two great s in country music. another great johnny and june song is ""if i were a carpenter"" and the best remake of that appears on ""those were the days"", dolly partons new album! check that out also! all in all i would not pass this cd up! great buy!"
5,Astounding quality!,"Its amazing how much two actors can sound like two real people. Witherspoon and Phoenix (I'm not sure how to spell it...) do an awesome job of singing these songs. They put a lot of effort into making the movie itself, but the actual singing took way more effort. Both of them went to music school for multiple months to make sure their parts are to the dollar. Witherspoon actually looked through June Carter's closet to make sure she knew what to wear! But thats just the movie. Seriously, this CD is amazing. One of the few soundtracks I listen to. An easy 5/5."
4,Good CD,"Good CD, I was a little disapointed that is isn't the exact music from the movie... all songs are studio versions of what was performed in the movie. But I still enjoy listening to it."
4,Good CD!,"My 2 year old daughter loved this movie so I bought the soundtrack to listen to in the car. All the songs are good, but there are a couple that sound like Reese and Joaquin are singing in different rooms. A good CD, but the music in the movie sounds better, however this way you get the whole song. I would recommend to others!"
5,Walk the Line,"A wonderful movie. Joaquin Phoenix was ideal as the young Johnny Cash - 19 to 37 years, The producers said they didn't want an actor and actress to portray John and June precisely and this is what I saw. The singing and guitar playing was right on. Joaquin should have won an Oscar also!"
5,Walk the Line CD,A winner! If you liked the movie you gotta have the CD. I'm not a country western fan. But his music is very good!
3,"Where is ""Times a Wastin'"" ??","This soundtrack is excellent! Let me just say that Joaquin & Reese did an outstanding job singing AND acting. In fact most of the songs, I thought they sung better than the originals. They seem to bring more life to the songs when they sing. The reason I gave this CD only 3 stars is because ""Times a Wastin"" is not on there! What were they thinking not to include such a fun-loving beautiful song?! That was my favorite in the movie... made me smile & laugh - It was just too adorable to not include on this album. So, without that song, I cannot bring myself to give the soundtrack 2 more stars; although everything else I am pleased with :) I really do hope that the producers will re-release the soundtrack ""Walk the Line"" so that it will include ""Times a Wastin."""
1,Utter disappointment,I bought this thinking it was the orginal Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash recordings. I'm not impressed with the actor's singing voices.
3,Just watch the movie,When I bought this cd I assumed it would be uplifting like it is in the movie. I was wrong. Don't waste your time listening to it more than once in a great while. The movie makes the music sound better.
5,Walk the Line Rocks!!,I went and saw this movie and I Just HAD to have this soundtrack it was awesome....Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon rock...they sound really good...makes me love Joaquin even more...whooooo baby!
5,INFORMATIVE,"Purchased this book for class, and it provides a lot of useful information and instructor teaches right out of it. Not too boring because it provides real life examples."
2,not good,I ordered my text book on the 31th Dec 2008 and was told I would recieve the book by 27th Jan 2009 and still have not recieved the book. I sent an e-mail to the seller and have not recieved a response.
4,Great Book,This book is just what i needed for my management class and it was priced at a reasonable rate. its self expanitory and intresting to read
3,Management 8th Edition,"The book is kind of very used, almost all pages are highlited, but still, general conditions, cover are excellent. Price and delivery very good."
5,Exactly what was promised,The seller sent the book quickly and I received it in excellent condition - I will buy from them again.
3,A damaged good delivered,The left rear side was severely dented(looks like it was damaged during the shipping). And the radiation from the Micro-oven shows on the nearby tv screen with scratchy interference. I fear the exposure to the oven.
4,very interesting work!,"Vivica Genaux is really great and Rene Jacobs too!!!!Some compositions by Riccardo Broschi (Farinelli's Brother) are not that great, but the general philosophy of work, and the interpretation of Vivica are amazing.Great recording to have if you like real Baroque stuff!"
2,Stitching didn't hold.,"I had a pair of BB's before, liked them very well and I wore them out. I purchased this pair that is a slightly different style. In a matter of 2 mos the seam on the uppers along side the laces has separated. . .on both shoes. I am very disappointed. I thought these would last awhile."
2,not what I expected!,Buster Brown is supposed to be a quality and durable brand. However after wearing these shoes for 3-4 days the sole separated from the rest of the shoe...talk about embarrassing for my son! Not sure if this was just a bad pair in the assembly line but I am very disappointed.
4,DMM SHADOW Keylock Screw Gate,Love DMM lockers. This screw gate one is a little on the small size. I usually recommend folks get auto-lock crabs as those remove one more possible element of human error.
5,Very good!,"We just tried this tonight right outta the oven. The taste is perfect, not too sweet, and great texture."
3,"OK, but needed some help",I'm surprised to see all those 5-star reviews. I bought these mixes directly from Hodgson Mill. The first time we made it the bread was very heavy and not very sweet. The second time I added some sugar but we still didn't enjoy the very dense texture. What to do with all those other boxes? We bought a box of another brand of gingerbread mix (which would probably have been too sweet on its own) and combined the two and it came out fine. I'm an experienced baker so I don't think I did anything wrong - with such simple instructions there isn't much you can make a mistake on but it's been a while so maybe they've changed the formula a bit.
1,Hodgson Mill Whole Wheat Gingerbread Mix,"I do not want to receive this ""Hodgson Mill Gingerbread Mix"". again .I have received .I have received 2-Boxes 6 pack each. I did not order these & do not want anymore "" Gingerbread Mix "" sent. Needless to say I am not happy about these orders being sent. Please do not send more. Linda Stauffer,"
3,Don't use over high heat,My wife recently used the pot potion of the cooker on our stove (part of intended use) but must have had the flame to high??? and the pot warped. It no longer sits evenly on the base of the cooker. I have never had a pot warp on me and was disappointed about this. I will be contacting the manufacturer to see if they will send a replacement.
2,It's okay but...,"The two stars are for the looks and it does a good job of keeping things warm, however, as a crockpot, I did not like it's performance. The heat is only at the base of the pot and therefore cooks the food differently than a crockpot where the heat surrounds the food. Also, the lid slips off the lip with just the slightest bump. I liked the thought of browning meats on the stovetop with the removable portion but on my glass top stove, the pot was shaking so violently that I had to keep a hand on it the whole time to keep it from falling off. I have not experienced that with any other pot I own so I'm not sure what was causing that."
2,No comparison to the older models!,"One of the first few times I used my new model, food stuck to the bottom in one area, and the 2"" mark is unremoveable! This pot shakes all over my stove when attempting to brown meat! I'm not sure if this is caused by the oval shape, or type of metal used with this one. I have owned possibly 10 of the older models over the past 30 years, and I liked them all way better than this model. This model is more pleasing to the eye, but that's about it! I have recommended the Westbend Slow-cookers to just about everyone I know, and now I feel obligated to tell them all not to buy this newer model! I am very disappointed in mine! Maybe I should look for my warranty card for return, and hopefully purchase an older model?!? Amazon... thanks so much for allowing me to vent! A very unhappy customer!"
3,Boils on Low,"On the low setting, mine boils and cooks a roast in 1/2 the time if not less. The liquid boils within a couple hours - luckily i've been home to turn it on warm and it seems to cook ok on this. This may just be my pot as it seems other consumers have not all experienced this. 5 stars if this weren't the problem because I really enjoy the ceramic pot - it's very easy to clean out. Overall, an ideal addition to any kitchen."
1,bad product,"Had to return this product for refund. Cooks too fast, if you put it on top of the stove to brown, it jiggles all over and if you have liquid in it it slops all over. The 4 qt. was a better product."
5,Mothers help,I have had the same west bend slow cooker for approx. 20 yrs and it still works as good today as it did the first time I used it. I purchased a 6 qt one for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. She also had a 4 qt west bend but with a large family it wasn't large enough. I will never use anyother brand.
4,westbend cooker,"exactly as expected. unit is what was needed for RV lifestyle, because of multiple uses."
5,Resources for debriefing evolutionary theory.,"This is one of the most comprehensive treatments of heretical Darwiniana ever penned and a must for anyone attempting to review the considerable underground legacy of second opinions about Darwinian theory. Too often one stumbles on a Darwin critique by accident. This work contains a massive bibliography of some 5000 items, with extensive quotations."
3,okay,"There's a lot of quantative data in this book, but not a lot of analysis, real commentary, or much qualitative information. So with respect to solid data one might refer to in a report or debate, its great, but not always the most interesting reading."
5,All the Savage Wit Fit to Print (and then some ... that is not),"A great little compendium filled with several centuries of saws, wit, adages and one-liners for those like myself ""into comedy and wit."" They are especially appropriate for those in search of the perfect ""one liners"" to add to a speech, or to keep an annoying acquaintance at bay, or as a ""comeback"" to sharp underhanded but oblique attacks.It would be (reverse) sexist to say that women seem to have the sharpest tongues in the arsenal of the armory of the verbal arts, but if one judges by this book, it must be true. So I'll just be ""politically incorrect"" and ""a (reverse) sexist,"" and say so: These adages and one liners, strung out across history, are not just funny, but they are, just as the book describes them, simply wicked, no! savage, devious, and pure evil. That is to say, delicious.Five stars"
3,Jan Jelinek - Tierbeobachtungen,"Jan Jelinek pushes further into ambient territory with _Tierbeobachtungen_, a droning fantasia. Instead of using loops of sharp cuts and snippets like his earlier work, Jelinek's loops now linger on, embracing the dub. ""A Concert for Television"" buzzes ceaselessly, like an electric hive, while ""Palmer Aus Lader"" sounds like a country drive to a farm of robotic animals. ""Up to My Same Old Tricks"" grinds and hums with a gritty sonic texture, but ""Happening Tone"" paints a much calmer and gentler soundscape. Curiously, there's not much development in these tracks -- something with which Jelinek has never struggled before -- so I imagine he's simply flexing his creative muscle, rather than repeating previous successes. And, finally, the title track winds things down on layers of structured noise and ringing. Curious."
1,Disposable Feather bed,"Purchased the feather bed and less than one year later the feather are only in the corners (so i thought). UNtil i called and they said that ""the feathers NATURALLY break down where your body lays"". i was shocked and said so ""what do i do...throw it out"" and she said to ""purchase the channel down feather bed, this way the feathers can MIGRATE up and down the comforter"". I'm so disgusted. I guesss they think you should buy a $200 feather bed for every bed every year! Don""t waste your money, you""ll only get frustrated trying to fluff your feather bed!"
1,not as fluffy as the one in the hotel,I agree with the person from Japan. Not as fluffy on the one in the hotel. Very crunchy and uncomfortable. Go elsewhere.
5,my favorite scent,"I love this scent. I have to remember, however, that a little goes a long way! I put some in my car as a freshener. It's an energizing, invigorating scent."
5,Great product!,This oil smells amazing and is exactly what I was looking for. The price and convenience of not having to find a store that carries it was great.
2,Too Stron,I ended up with skin burns and an allergic reaction after using the lemon grass oil for muscle pain. When I returned an unused bottle I was reimbursed.
4,Cloth diaper use,You only need a drop or two. I use this to keep the diaper pail odors at bay until laundry day and it does a great job. I also use three drops in my wipe solution and it smells nice. It has a slight smell of ginger. I gave it four stars because of this but the companyPlantlife gets 5 stars.
3,Product is ok but shipping cost more than product,I ordered this product at the same time I was ordering several other products. Didn't realize that the shipping cost was more than I paid for the product itself. Though the product was fine it certainly ended up being costly for such a small bottle.
3,The best brand I've found so far ......,"Plantlife makes a nice Lemongrass oil, but based on another reviewer's comment, I expected the scent to be a little stronger than it actually was.The products (I also purchased the Sweet Orange oil and a wooden soap dish) were packed better than well and came very quickly. Also included were a sample of the Lavender Body Wash and Lavender soap. The body wash was so-so - not enough lather for me and only a faint smell to it - but the soap was SUPER DUPER smelling and produced tons of creamy lather! HOORAY!!!!"
3,Compulsively readable,"Nothing is more fun than reading about other's problems and neuroses. Schaudenfreude aside, the characters here have great depth and the barbs they trade are worth the price of admission. L'Heureux's character gives new meaning to the phrase, ""don't judge a book by its cover.""Unfortunately, the conclusion felt too neat -- too forced, particularly in the face of all of the events that ""went down"" throughout the course of the book......"
5,Cast Alaska Trailer,"Length:: 2:20 MinsI love this movie and if you're a fly fisherman you will too. Here's the trailer for the movie, it does a good job of whetting your appetite for the film and making you itch to get out on the river!"
3,Wake me up when it's over...,"Sorry Dean... but I am always looking for the latest in your books and this time I was excited to see Mr. Murder hit the shelves. And hit the shelves it did... with a splat. As thirsty as I was for another of your great reads, this wasn't it. I tried hard to get into it but I found myself skipping ahead to see it if got better. It didn't."
3,Koontz's verbosity exceeded only by his predictability!,"Alas, it seems that when you have sold over 150,000,000 books, the axe loses its edge. This book reads as a companion to ""Dark Rivers..."" and it would be hard to tell which came first. However, considering that both were published within a relatively short time of each other, we can only expect more of the same. While I appreciate the need for character development, this book takes it to extremes. Enough already. We know that Martin is just the gosh darndest nicest guy you could ever hope to meet with a family to rival that of any 60's family sitcom creator. As for the bad guy....well, boy oh boy....he is a bad 'un. And this much we have ascertained before the story really unfolds. So please Mr. Koontz, enough already. Reread ""Icebound"" or ""Hideaway""; that's how you used to write"
2,Typical Koontz,"Another book by Koontz that has once again given reason to why I dislike most of his writing. Once and awhile, he pulls out a winner, but this, sadly, is not it.He takes a seemingly interesting premise, that of a dopple-ganger terrorizing a family, and kills it. The characters are flat, all too perfect, and lack any developement. Like in many of his books, Koontz pulls out the genetic, government-created killing-machine as the answer to the villain of the book.It worked in 'The Watchers', but not here. It seems the man has to do something like this in a lot of his work just so he can pull out a rant about how humans shouldn't 'play God' and about how screwed up humanity is.Several, and in my opinion better, Koontz books include the Odd Thomas and Frankenstein series, 'Life Expectancy', 'Intensity', and, of course, 'The Watchers'. But this is definately not a book I will read again."
3,Take it or Leave it...,"I certainly could see a review going either way for this book. As I read the beginning chapters, the development of the characters was very slow, and I was drawn in to keep reading, only because I kept feeling like something was missing. I was waiting for some huge revelation... but it never came.I loved the characters. They felt like real people, and Koontz allows us to follow each and every one of them. Their POVs, their thoughts, their reactions all feel very real.The plot, while a bit eccentric, is somewhat believable... up until the end. It all wraps up a tad too neatly for my tastes.However, the writing style and language certain make this book an easy and entertaining read."
2,Only Koontz Novel I've Put Down,"I like Koontz as an author, and I've read his other works. My favorites wereOdd ThomasandThe Face. If you've read other Koontz novels, the story in Mr. Murder will be a distilling of the 'standard' Koontz archetype. It could be said the book is a self-parody of Koontz, but it is clearly intended as a serious work.A typical cornier-than-the-Brady-Bunch American family are stalked by the typical Koontz psycho-killer who's a sexual predator. For Koontz, the pacing is slow (50-75 pages could be cut easily), and the prose limp. The main character being a horror novelist uncomfortably reminded me of Stephen King's ""Misery."" Overall, it felt like I was reading about caricatures (gutsy horror novelist protagonist {biographical?}, bombshell wife, too-smart kids) and not characters.I found 'Mr. Murder' narrow and too similar in plot and events with other Koontz novels. Predictable. I recommend you read a different Koontz novel instead, as this was his worst effort."
3,Always Entertained By Dean Koontz,"From my teenaged years to today, I continue to love Dean Koontz books. That is more than 3 decades of love. Koontz never fails to deliver suspense.Being a more critical, or perhaps just a grumpy old woman, though, I find his character's dialogue stiff, perhaps because these are largely one dimensional creations. Good Verses Evil dilemmas.Mr. Murder is no exception. It remains an entertaining read and this clone monster created by The Network will stop at nothing to get what he needs. Until he tries to take over Author Martin Stillwater's life. Then it's a fight to to the death."
3,"Slightly compelling, but pretty average","Once again, Koontz comes up with narrow goodies and one of the more boring baddies. I did NOT like the bit where Alfie kills the girls pets (I hate cruelty to animals), but the end put a smile on my face, proving that some people aren't all bad."
4,Magnifico Mr. Koontz,Good start...but not so good Closing. Maybe too easy and guessable End. But I liked it and I'd recommend it and all other books from this talented writer. Need to have some more.
5,A great book with a weird deathmatch!,You would have never expected to see the coming of the events in this book. That's why this is a great book. It's one of the best books of the century.
5,Exciting and thrilling book!,Did not want to stop reading. I needed to know what was going to happen next. I loaned the book out and could not get it back. I am ordering a second book for a second read.
4,"very good, but weak at points","this book was very good. It definitly kept me at the edge of my seat. Yet, at the same time I thought the storyline was becoming too unbeliavble. This was the first book I had read by Dean Koontz, and i plan on reading more, even if at points i thought this book needed work"
3,Concentrate On The Little Things,"With everything happening in Mr. Murder, what I liked most about the book was the exact opposite of the main focus of the novel. With all the major charcters being men, Marty, Alfie, Drew, Karl, I couldn't help but like the novel because of the women involved in it. Koontz writes Charlotte and Emily, Marty's daughters, and Paige, his wife, so well, we wish they were the only people in the story. When the conversation centers around Marty and Paige talking and trying to rationalize about Alfie, we only feel what Paige is saying. She's a strong charcter, Marty is not. And the conversations between the two little sisters, Charlotte and Emily, were so much fun, and so right-on that I smiled and looked forward to each conversation they had in the book. With all the action and plot points going on in the Mr. Murder, I don't think Dean Koontz meant for the novel to be what I liked it for. Oh well."
1,Mr. Maudlin,"Oh, I screamed all right...because Dean Koontz has descended to a new level of bad writing. He tries so hard to make us care about the main characters, but they're so sweet he could package them and get into the saccharin business. 'The Fabulous Stillwater Parenting Machine'...'""They are very kissable...So's your tush""! Give me a break, even the Brady Bunch wasn't this bad! The antagonist, by the way, is a genetically engineered guy (I am so tired of evil scientists being the cause of all known sorrow in the world) who isn't even given a chance to reform, just shot. Bang. Then, in a scene borrowed from Dark Rivers of the Heart, the main characters change their names and live happily ever after"
1,"Cardboard cut-outs for characters, movie-of-the-week plot","Another one-star effort by Dean Koontz. ""Mr. Murder"" is a somewhat interesting story that succombs to a plot written to be the movie-of-the week. The characters are dull and one-dimensional. It's impossible to care about such contrived characters that are just soooo sweet. This is the third (and it will be the last) Dean Koontz novel that I've read. After each book I'm left with the same empty feeling that I have after watching some mindless TV movie, and that is regretting that I've wasted my time. After a good novel I find myself running through scenes in my mind and thinking about the characters. After reading Dean Koontz I'm left with nothing."
2,Didn't Enjoy That Much,"Martin Stillwater is a mystery novelist with a wife who is a psychologist and two daughters. There is somebody else out there who is a killer . . . who could that be? They want to take over Marty's life and identity . . . They want what Marty has . . . Could that be Marty himself or somebody else? I will not tell you the answers, but I could not wait until I found out for myself.Anyway, the storyline was a pretty good idea. However, I didn't like the writing style. A lot of unnecessary detail and rambling on made this book tiring.I won't say more about this book, because I don't want to give it away. But, however, I wouldn't recommend it. Even if you like the author. I like a different book by this author, but this book wasn't as good."
4,Pretty Good,"In typical Koontz fashion, he takes a happy family of four living in southern California and turns their lives upside down. All are incredibly intelligent, including the two very young daughters (something that really bugged me about this novel is the fact that the children spoke so eloquently and unlike how actually children speak). The wife has survived a traumatic childhood and his now a great Psychiatrist, and the husband is a successful novelist. An out of control government agency changes all that for this serene family, and their lives are soon turned upside down, and they never return to the environment that they were accustomed to in southern California. Surprisingly, there are no Golden Retrievers in this story! Heh, despite the elements that bugged me a tad bit, this was another excellent Koontz novel. Though it was quite predictable and the setting/characters/plot has been done before by him. Still worth reading, however."
3,A Koontz Clone?,"Mr. Koontz seemingly casts himself in the leading role for this thrilling novel. Martin Stillwater, a thrill/mystery writer, must have a lot in common with his Creator and part of the fun of this story is to get a glimpse at how Mr. Koontz might actually be in real life.The rest of the fun comes from a fast-moving plot and enjoyable characters that once again capture the reader's imagination and hold it hostage for 400 pages."
2,It is an odd book,"This is my first time reading a novel by Dean Koontz. I didn't really understand what point the author was trying to make in the book. It simply seemed to strange to me. It is not really a Sci Fi novel, but yet ""the killer"" has super human strength and can fully heal from bullet wounds in a matter of several hours.I just did understand why ""the killer"" was pulled to Marty Stillwater. The psychological part just did attract me.It was very confusing to me. Dean Koontz seems like a write that can make exceptional descriptions of his characters, but he doesn't do a great job of explaining the plot very well."
3,"Slightly compelling, but pretty average","Once again, Koontz comes up with narrow goodies and one of the more boring baddies. I did NOT like the bit where Alfie kills the girls pets (O hate cruelty to animals), but the end put a smile on my face, proving that some people aren't all bad."
5,Outstanding book. One of Koontz's best.,I couldn't put it down. Great story with character depth. I highly recommend it.
2,"Didn't care, didn't like it, didn't finish it",Let me start by saying that I think Dean Koontz is a terrific writer. I've read his books prior to and after this one and have enjoyed them. After more than 2 weeks of falling asleep after a single paragraph I finally put it up and went on to something else. Don't really know what it was about this book but man it was a snoozer! Sorry Dean.
1,I did not like this book.,The book was too childish. It was nothing compared to the horror of R.L. Stein and the goosebumbs series
3,curse of canaan,"Mullins is all over the place in this book. I found it hard to read, track or collate with other information gleaned from other sources."
2,Not a completed order-as yet...CD ROM media is still unavailable,"This handbook while well researched and written is essentially worthless without the accompanying software. I ordered the book in January received it in February, as yet (early April) have NOT received the advertised electronic media which is critical to inclusion with every purchase.The book only (actually) serves as the guide for installing and programming data acquisition sub-routines (templates) within the National Instruments LabVIEW programming language, again which is supposed to be on the ACCOMPNYING CD-ROM.I have requested the software twice since my initial order, and each time only received the handbook manual. Oh, the shipping of a replacement is quick enough, there just seems to be no one within the distribution chain aware enough to know to bundle the handbook with the ""virtual instruments"" LabVIEW proprietary software."
1,What a waste of time and tape.,"I wish there was a way to give this video ""zero stars."" This video is amateurish in it's execution, looking much like a student project. The filming often doesn't show the proper execution of the exercises, and the ""instructors"" frequently direct their comments at the wrong camera. Some of the exercises demonstrated are questionable in their safety. At the end of the tape is a ridiculous spot featuring Tracy James, which seems to be edited into the wrong place on the tape. He is inviting us to ""get ready for the workout,"" which has just been completed. Maybe this was supposed to be a comedy? Save your money, everyone. There are much better workout tapes available."
4,Nice style of writing,"After finishing Game of Thrones, I was hoping for another series that would equal George R.R. Martin's , I think my expectations were too high. Still this was a good series and well written"
4,I love this series!,"I'm not sure if it is simply because I love Japanese culture, but this series is just amazing. This book definitely ends with kind if a cliffhanger, but its just beautifully written! The imagery is amazing....you feel like you are right there with the characters! I'm actually going to take a break because I'm not ready to end this journey yet lol"
3,got to think about that,"To bad, after reading 1-4, I found out that the Author wrote another book, that goes before book one, that kind of puts some the story in more perspective. Having lived in Japan, some the names are not really Japanese. The books were passed on to me by a Japanese, and they told me the same thing. It is entertaining to some respect, I would expect one day to be a book six/"
3,Disappointing ending,"I agree with other posters critical of the ending. You get to about 20 pages left in the book and you're thinking, ""no way is Hearn going to finish this series this book, is she?"" Well she does, and it's disappointing. Otherwise, all in all, the series was entertaining enough to warrant the time and money."
4,Brilliance of the Moon - A brilliant conclusion!,"Brillance of the Moon concludes the trilogy, Tales of the Otori, written by Lian Hearn. Each book is a wonderful tale of ancient Japan, there are complex characters and riveting battle sequences.The first book (Across the Nightingale Floor) is the most engaging of the three but the other two are just as exciting to read. Don't be discouraged by other reviewers, these books are wonderful to read with characters that you miss once you've finished each book.When I saw that this title had arrived, I couldn't wait to see where Takeo and Kaede's lives were going. Admitedly there are weaknesses to this book, it wasn't the strongest of the three but it is still worth the read!Try these books and please read all three! You will be happy you did."
2,Started off so well....,"The first book of this trilogy is the best. So rich in detail. Well defined characters. Such a good pace. It made me scour every bookshop I knew looking for the second and third books. When I found them, I got a distinct feeling that something or someone was rushing Ms. Hearn to finish the series...or she got bored with Japan....whatever the reason is it is to the detriment of the plot. You know when an unimaginative/bored person is telling a story? There's a lot of ""and then...and then and then..."". Hope you get my drift."
1,Unbelievably crass ending.,"After blazing through the first two volumes, and halfway into the conclusion, my reading, and enjoyment of the series came to screeching halt.Somewhere between the first page and 200 of the finale, Takeo and Kaede had became bumbling, inept and whining caracatures of themselves. WHAT happened to the strength and insight of the caracters I had learned to love? Their simpering and laughable ""decisions"" are a gross insult to the series...Damn, and I was SO enjoying it too!"
3,My interest is waning,"I loved the first book. I enjoyed the second book, but found the plot line somewhat annoying and self-centered. I read about 15 pages of the third book and put it down to read some other time."
2,Depends upon your use of them,"After watching a Dr. Oz special which lauded the digestive effects of Caraway Seeds, I ran to my computer to order some immediately. The idea that ingesting a half a handful of seeds would cure me of excessive gas and bloat had me excited beyond words, until I received them in the mail and shoved them in my mouth ...Word to the wise, do NOT eat caraway seeds by the handful - you may choke to death, but even worse, you may not. Picture a day at the farm, walking through the stables ... now picture picking up some straw and shoving it into your mouth ... that would be preferable to chewing craway seeds.The best parallel to eating caraway seeds would be if you went to woodshop, picked up the carvings, mixed it with dirt and pepper and chewed.Now that doesn't mean that you shouldn't buy them, but be aware they need to be an ingredient ... like if you want to bake your own rye, although, that seems foolhardy since Rye bread is cheap."
4,Ross Thomas is the Best,"The only problem is this book is not one of his best. However, I intend to continue to read his excellent works."
5,A Gem!,"Ross Thomas is a great American novelist. His style is impeccable--he's never off balance and always sparkling and witty. Treat yourself and read this book. I'd read it years ago and forgotten how good this guy is. And unlike other writers who fancy themselves stylists, the book is actually interesting and engaging. It's ABOUT something."
3,It's No Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.,"If your a fan of cheap bad movies this one still doesn't make any grade at all. Give me ""Plan 9 from Outer Space,"" ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" these had some atempt of being made bad and cheap. I what the time I spent watching this movie added back onto my life."
3,Anything WWll,"Like the title, I'll watch anything WWll...at least once. This is not one of the better WWll movies, but is a story line I haven't heard before. You are conquered, so what do you do. The big driver in this story is that the hero couldn't tell anyone what he was doing so even his family thought he was collaborating with the enemy until after he was dead. None of the submarines built in his shipyard sank a ship. None of the actors are well known but John Wayne/Gary Cooper/Clint Eastwood can't be in every movie. Well worth watching."
3,Interesting Intrigue,"Although a little hard to follow at the outset, Ralph Richardson gives a strong performance. The filming and editing are weak."
4,Interesting propaganda film,Tells the story from the viewing of the occupied people. How does an occupied people handle the day to day occupation? This movies shows the fine line they must walk.
2,Silver Fleet,A cheaply make movie with very little water and submarine action.....Sorta like a documentary but not a movie worth watching.....
3,Silver Fleet,"This is a different perspective than the usual US or British perspective. I thought it was ok, worth watching. I don't know that I will watch it again."
4,Triumph,another great release from Immortal. the songs are shorter & more to the point than the tracks on Sons of Northern Darkness & At the Heart of Winter; they are also faster in tempo & more brutal. production is still crystal clean just like the aforementioned albums.
4,Nice,Product is OK. Pick your collour carefully. The actual lipstick is darker the it looks on your screen. You'd better have a palette.
5,Just as I expected,"I was looking for a lipstick to replace my LANCOME discontinued lipstick called ""Rouge Amethyste"" and so I tried this one and it turned out to be an excellent replacement.This lipstick is a deep ""burgundy-wine"" color, and it's exactly what I needed for the Holidays.Looks great under other colors too--- as a layering lipstick.Great replacement for Rouge Amethyste by Lancome."
4,"WAY BETTER THAN PERFUME I only withold 1 star cause, I mean...cause...","one saves that for the mother or father of one's children or generation or whatever. 5 stars if for JK Huysmans.I picked this up on a 2nd hand store for a dollar or so didn't expect much from the sort of salacious carrot that's the title, but the li'l reviews were so extravagant I was even able to overlook comparisons to ""Perfume"" which, in facct, I loathed!So go ahead and read this book y'all."
1,A Sudden and Unsatisfying Ending,"This book is very densely plotted...too much so. There are too many characters and details, making it a tough slog.But the real reason I feel compelled to share my experience (and, as a writer, I shy away from criticizing others' efforts) is that the ending is so incredibly abrupt, making me wonder if they edited it down for the paperback version. We join the climactic scene after it is already well in progress...I thought I was missing some pages but I wasn't. And everything is suddenly wrapped up in a page and a half. Given where the story stood, I thought another 50 pages remained and were needed. Turns out those pages were a preview of his next book.As it was, it was all work and little payoff. And the main characters didn't really draw me in like Laura Lippman's Tess or Larry Block's Matt Scudder.I admire the author's plotting skills and knowledge, but there's an editor who did him a real disservice."
2,Slow Kill,"McGarrity has disappointed the reader in his last two books, this one especially. The plot and storylines have not been up to par with his previous books, which I enjoyed immensely. His ending in Slow Kill does not wrap up the loose ends and appears hurried. His ending in his last book also seemed ""hurried""."
2,A Disappointing Entry,"I have read McGarrity's other Kevin Kerney mysteries, so I was looking forward to this one. The book has McGarrity's easy-going style that brings in a lot of the New Mexico atmosphere. That style was the strongest thing about the book. The plot (you can get summaries of the plot in other reviews) is convoluted. That is not necessarily a bad thing in a mystery novel. But it is a horrendous thing in a novel that seemed to be operating under limited space requirements, as if the author were under pressure to keep the book under 280 pages (it's 278 pages in hardback). The ending was rushed. Not all of the loose ends got tied up, at least not to the satisfaction of this reader. Perhaps McGarrity will revisit some of these plot elements in a later work. But the result was a book not up to the level of the rest of the series."
1,Very limited adventures of a no name actor,I was very disappointed with Marco Perella's book. I read alot of hollywood biographies and books about film making. I think I expected a little more substance. The stories that he shared about working with certain actors were boring. I could not tell if he purposely left out the behind the scenes anecdotes or he was so far down on the pecking order that he did not really have any real experiences to share. I would not recommend this book.
5,A Laugh OUTLOUD Book,"Marco Perella is a self described ""No Name Actor"" who has worked with many huge stars such as Kevin Costner, Drew Barrymore,Charlie Sheen, the list goes on and on. I work in the operating room, and I laughed so hard outloud while reading it that the surgeon thought I was laughing at him! My favorite story is ""Streetcar Named Desire""- Having some experience in TV and theatre, I found it poignant and quite laughably true. Now I find myself thinking back to some of the described scenes and will be looking for you Marco!"
1,5-star Bardort classic in VHS resolution on DVD Media,"Dear Amazon:NOTE: (Not a review of the Criterion release - the one to buy)I request a full refund of this BIG Productions DVD since it is actually a poor quality VHS movie (240 lines of horizontal resolution) transferred to DVD media. Even the credits are blurry. TV resolution of 330 lines is better than this.The movie is not really anamorphic since there is not enough horizontal resolution to even fill a 21-inch screen and still be reasonably satisfying to view. On a 50-inch plasma you will see a 32"" x 24"" picture of poor VHS quality.The package is incorrect: it has two images each with Bardot; a third image shows Eli Wallach and Carrol Baker from the 1956 film Baby Doll. Obviously, BIG Productions is totally incompetant and irresponsible, and therefore must not be allowed to sell any DVDs on Amazon."
2,Beautiful looking dud,"Uh oh...this gorgeous transfer from Criterion is the only consolation for a lame turkey of a movie. The material is very dated, and there is little irony at work here, just a director in the thrall of Bardot. When Vadim called 'Action' on this one, he left content, narrative and interest at the back door. For Bardot crazies and completists only."
1,"Brigitte Bardot, way over-rated","I don't get it, what's so great about Brigitte Bardot? She was soooooo famous.The movie has nice scenes of Monte Carlo and the color restoration makes the natural scenes very pretty. Brigitte Bardot is neither pretty nor has a particularly attractive body, she must be a good actress then :)"
2,And God created woman review,I was very disappointed in the movie. This may have been sexy or R rated for the fifty's but it is PG by today's standards. It was well done but don't waste your money if you are looking for sexy.JP
3,a groundbreaking film,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.This release was supervised by director Roger Vadim who died while the DVD was being produced.This film highly controversal at the time of the release in the US (it was considered racy) but is tame by today's standards.It got a PG rating for it's 1978 rerelease in the USThe film was also remade in 1988 by the same director and title and the remake got an R rating.The original French title is ""Et Dieu créa la femme""The film is about a young woman whose hedonistic tendencies cause problems in the town she is living in. Her husband attempts to calm her but that also causes problems.The Criterion DVD has a theatrical trailer in English and there is also a restoration demonstration."
3,.....AND A BIT OVERATED!,"Bardot is just fine ....but this is not a great movie. Still one of the better one""s that BB had made over the years. Criterion has once again done a great job on the print. OK to add to your collection if you are a BB or Criterion fan."
3,And God Created Bardot,This is a milestone work of French cinema. Unfortunately it is a limited zone edition which is a problem here in Australia. All DVDs sold through Amazon should be multi-zone or very clearly marked.
1,King OfThe North,"I can't turn the volume up enough to hare it . The audio is terrible !!!. Video is okay , But its useless"
4,Hanging On the great depression,"This is a real time essay on living during the Great Depression in Flint. It has humor, pathos, and is very descriptive of how people survived (or didn't) life at a time when the banks closed and jobs were terribly scarce and life was cash or barter only. I felt it is an impressive book about really tough times by one who lived through it."
5,A Real Comfort,"Ms. Anderson understands what people go through with the loss of a close pet. She speaks from her heart and in a way that the reader knows to be true. Her words are comforting. She explains how you feel and why, and how to cope with the anger, grief, and guilt. Anyone who has lost a pet, or will be euthanizng a pet in pain, should read this book."
3,Helpful,"I did find this book helpful, but it told me everything I already knew. Sometimes it is good to just hear the things you know stated again and this book does that. I wanted more however. I wanted to know my baby was okay. I recommend this book for help in healing, but for comfort, I found books like Cold Noses and Fido much more helpful."
5,Coping With sorrowon the loss of Your Pet,Delivery of this item was quick and am happy with the item and the service.
4,Very comforting,"In having to make one of the toughest decisions in my life, this book was comforting and helpful. I wish I had read it beforehand, but in the end, what I did read helped us make the decision without guilt."
2,Practically useless,"If you're already well acquainted with the life and works, I suppose you might find this book charming. You'd already have to have read a real biography of Wodehouse, like McCrum's, to make any use of it. Like many other books touted as biographies, it's really a fan's notes and opinions -- gabby, dotty, discursive, heavily slanted and defensive, often frustratingly vague. Donaldson knew Wodehouse and had access to his papers, so she could have written the definitive bio. She wrote nothing remotely like it."
2,"Good book for children, but...","Not one for adults, really. It's well illustrated, but the text is very basic. It's a good book for beginners. But if you're even an average railfan, you'll probably find this book dull. You won't find anything in the way of new information.I was disappointed in this book. If you're looking for something with some meat in it, look elsewhere. The really sad part is that some of the best books written on steam locomotives in general and American Railroading in particular are now out of print."
5,A Set of Late Masterpieces,"Written towards the of Martinu's life, these choral pieces are a simultaneous celebration of Czech rural life and an expression of the composer's acute sense of exile. Martinu's exile began in the late 30s with the German occupation of Czechoslovakia and continued through to the end of his life because of the Communist dominance of his homeland. The text of these pieces was written by Martinu's boyhood friend, the poet Miloslav Bures. These four pieces are arranged in a seasonal round, beginning with spring (The Opening of the Wells) and ending in winter (Mikes of the Mountains). The last piece, completed just months prior to Martinu's death, contains a clear presentiment of death and a profound sense of loss at never again seeing his homeland. Martinu communicates what must have been for him profound emotion in an almost understated way with lyrical and powerful music. The performances on this CD are very good."
2,I wasted my money,"I waited and waited for this unit's price to drop so I could make a case to myself that I should buy this unit to replace my Canon i960 Photo printer, EPSON 2580 Scanner, and old HP 4L Laser Jet that were clogging up my desk. I especially wanted this one to scan negatives and slides. Well, that feature is especially poor. Every slide contains diagonal lines through it (the same slide scans perfect on the EPSON) so I had to break out the EPSON again for slide scanning. Photo printing quality is no where near as good as my Canon so that is now back on my desk. The only thing I use this for now is standard printing and scanning and now I have a fax machine (which I have to manually scan each page), but in the end I have 3 units on my desk again which defeated the purpose of this purchase."
1,piece of cr**!,"this is the second hp all-in-one i've purchased and both have had the same problems of poor paper feed, paper jam and carriage jam errors to the point it is just absolutely unusable and a major headache. very poor quality!"
2,No longer prints black! HP won't fix it.,"Apparently this model and several other HP printers have a fatal flaw - at some point one color or another no longer prints. For me it was black.I tried replacing the black cartridge several times -- using HP-brand cartridges mind you -- and although they were detected and indicated as full, black still wouldn't print. No problem with the other colors, but what use is a printer that doesn't print black?I contacted HP support and after running me through steps I had already taken - rebooting the printer, cleaning the heads, rebooting again, etc - was told that I could get a discount on a new printer. Sound familiar?Why would I buy another printer from HP when this one stopped working for no apparent reason?I had no issues with this printer until now. I'm truly disappointed."
2,Works good when working,"This printer works really good when it wants to work. I always get the error of incorrect paper size when i'm using 8.5 x 11 paper. i don't know what other size to use since it is the standard size ment for this printer. I contacted HP and they told me to reset the default settings. I did that knowing that wouldn't help. and it didn't every time i try to print checks (again 8.5 x 11 size) i get this stupid message that i'm using the wrong size of paper. so what should take me two seconds takes me ten minutes. Also sometimes it prints really fast (like 2 seconds) and other times it take 2 minutes to print something. and i'm talking about checks again so it isn't that complicated just name of place, date, and amount. I would love to throw this thing away but i can't afford a new one now."
2,Ink Hog!!!,"This printer works reasonably well. However, the constant need to replenish these tiny ink cartridges is leading me to seriously consider dumping the printer, about a year after I bought it. I can't give you an exact metric like so many ounces per print or whatever, but, take my word for it, you will be replacing cartridges on this thing every couple of weeks if you do any small amount of printing at all. It is incredibly frustrating.Update 5/2009 -- the ink situation on this thing is just absurd. If you have any substantial sized project (like a few drafts of a 20 page document), be prepared to buy a whole new set of ink cartridges halfway through whatever you are doing. This thing is just useless if you want to use it for light business purposes once in a while. Do not buy this as your ""home office"" printer. I am going to replace it with a laser."
4,Good All-In-One for home office,Works well and is well designed -- tilt out control board. Gave it a 4 because once in a while it will disconnect from the computer. This is easy to fix by turning the printer off then on or restarting the software. If those fail you have to reboot. The same thing goes for scan functions but that is addressed in the manual.
4,Quality Printing,"Love the wireless capabilities. Had some issues getting it up and running wireless, had to install twice. Once running does great pictures and works well. Quality product."
3,poor background on faceplate...wireless setup is poor,"I'm having problem to read the numbers (eg 1,6 ect) and name of functions keys (eg setup ect) on faceplate due to poor background and color contrastIf I need to fax and dial a phone I need to get very close to All in 1The wireless connection is not well developed as the photosmart 2170the printer can't recognized my IP either manual or automatic IPI prefer the C6180Thanks"
5,Change my five star rating to a two star rating.,"The first unit did not work except for the first hour. Getting a replacement unit was very difficult. The replacement unit does not send or receive FAX. Must return original unit within three days or my debit card will be charged for a second unit - and after that I will not be allowed to return it for credit. It came Saturday and today is Sunday. FAX or no FAX working on replacement unit, I have to return the original defective unit tomorrow.The C7180 is very slow and awkward to use but results are good and maybe I'll get used to the protocols.The instruction book says that if I use DSL and connect my laptop to the desktop by using an Integrated wireless WLAN 802.11 network setup then speed and reliability will improve. Maybe it will even FAX? Wish I had the money to try this.Please reduce my original 5 star rating to a 2 star rating."
3,"Good quality, but...","I was surprised to find there was no paper feed on this machine. I guess I could have checked ahead of time, but why? Isn't that something you assume? Anyway, the quality is great, but what a world class hassle to have to put each individual page on the glass, especially for faxing multiple page docs!!"
3,Connectivity with a firewall is a problem,"The printer prints nicely - of course. Setup is a major pain, due to the firewall issues. I am reasonably computer-literate. I have had 6-9 emails back and forth with HP's competent support. I am still fighting the setup after a week. It is still impossible to scan & save to computer or to use the card reader. This is a problem w/ this series printer.I have now been directed to uninstall / install the entire thing.I am close to suggesting that no user buy it unless a computer person can handle the connectivity/firewall issues."
3,setup problems,I just got this machine and have realized that a very large drawback is that their is no automatic feed for the fax. You have to fax 1 page at a time. big inconvenience. also the software that came with the 7180 is for a different machine a posed some big problems getting it going.
3,not vista friendly,"HP does not mention, but c7180 is not really compatable with vista, even the hp update on the web site may not work. Printer top is very poorly made and can break off the weak plastic hinges. Printing is good and pictures are very good, but the lack of vista support makes this only a decent printer until HP figures out a good driver and software for the vista operating system. Works great in XP and Media system."
1,Quirky and Frustrating,"One problem after another.... mostly due to the Wi-Fi connection. We frequently have to go through the Add a Printer wizard via Control Panel to get the printer to function. The scanner has not opertated from day 1. We use Dell Inspiron 1520 laptops running Window Vista. I would not recommend purchasing the computer, the HP product, or the operating system. None are ready for prime time."
1,What A Piece of Trash!,"OMG. I have owned or used hundreds of printers since 1980. Dot-matrix, thermal paper, inkjet, laser and dye sublimation. NEVER have I encountered such a problematic, slow, expensive to run and overall CHEAP piece of CRAP! It takes FOREVER to initialize upon power up. The SIX ink tanks run out CONSTANTLY with even light duty. Multiple errors are always popping up. It tells you to replace the ink cartridge that you just replaced. It tells you they are the wrong type of cartridges when they are not. When you have an ink problem NOTHING else works! You can't FAX, you can't scan, even to a memory device! WORTHLESS! If you are considering buying one of these doorstops, do yourself a favor and RUN AWAY!"
2,It's an annoying printer,"For a printer of it's price and alleged quality, it holds amazingly little paper and it's not easy to load.Copies are very good; even but VERY slow.The most irksome problem that I've had with this printer however, is it's print orientation portrait vs landscape. When I print a multiple page document Page 1 comes out portrait, page 2 landscape, page 3 portrait, and so on!! The only was to work around this that I've discovered is to set up each page as an individual print job.Overpriced."
1,2 1/2 year old...now a piece of junk! DO NOT BUY!,There's no point in reviewing this product. It doesn't work!I barely used this unit and in the past year the Yellow ink level was not detected anymore. Bought different cartridges and replaced to no avail. Called HP tech support with the end result of 'amazing discounted prices' and 'loyalty discount' if I decide to upgrade.HP sells me a piece of junk and now they want me to upgrade?Never another HP product!
5,I am impressed,"I had heard about goofy software problems with this printer, but went ahead and bought it anyway. Set up was very easy. I set it up for a wireless network with both PC and Mac. It prints flawlessly from both computers as well as from my phone (bluetooth). Print quality I think, is supurb. I haven't tried scanning from mine, but in the store the photo scan and the document scan were very, very good. It was the ease of printing in the store a picture that was on my phone, that convinced me. I did it with no one there and no manual. I think HP has done a tremendous job with this printer and I have used Epson and Canon before this one (epson 2000P, 7600, Canon ip4000). Great printer, easy setup"
2,HP Photosmart,The printer works fine. Those very tiny ink cartridges run out all the time and are expensive.
4,Smooth,I like How easy the setup was. This was really easy great networking and prints Great Pictures I cannot understand why HP is dropping this machine.
3,Not Windows Vista Friendly,"The driver software that comes with the printer will not install on Windows Vista operating system. No where in their specs or description of this printer does HP mention this fact. As a result I had to search the internet for a driver that would allow my Windows Vista to print. If I want to fax or copy, you cannot do this from the bottom task bar as Windows Vista will not allow you to launch the printer capabilies since it does not recognize the launch buttons. Instead you have to fax or copy from the ""Paint"" feature in the ""Accessories"" menu. If you happen to own the Business edition of Windows Vista you can use their ""Fax view and scanner option"". This inability to place an icon on the task bar is very annoying and had the HP description mentioned that it was not compatable with Window Vista I would not have purchased this printer. I would have purchased the Lexmark X5470 for $250 less money."
4,Good product,The C7180 Photosmart all in one has been a solid performer since I purchased about a month ago. I use for photos as an amateur Photographer. Photos are clear and chrisp. I also use for normal printing where it prints as fast as any printer I had previously.Lost a start on the ink usage; I don't think its as good as advertised.
4,Setting up the HP Photosmart C7180,I found this item extremely easy to setup and operate as a stand-alone printer and the early results have been very satisfactory.
4,C7180 Printer,I bought this printer because it does not make my home look like an office. It could ealiy pass for a piece of stereo equipment. I also really like the wire connectivity to give me freedom to put it anywhere. The drivers for Vista from HP can use some more work but the glitches are not showstoppers.
2,Broken the next day,"We bought this printer for general use between school and work. Looked very nice and clean cut. When I took it home I printed out two photos and they came out with streaks. I went back into stapels where I bought it and the guy knew something was wrong and told me to get some updates online. I did that. Well I tried printing out a page for school and the paper was jammed and after taking all the paper out and trying to do it agian I kept getting a cartliage jamm screen. Ends up being the printer had hardware problems and hense I had to return it and get a new one. I didnt get the same printer because i thought it was weird I gotten one already broken. Needless to say, Stapels is a awsome place to buy from. very helpful and quick to please while taking care of all the little details."
1,Bunk. Total Bunk.,"I was curious to see what Mr. Van Tilburg would have to say about canyoneering. The answer was worse than I expected. He had nothing to say. He repeats a few tired cliches. He has a few flashy chapter titles. But the meat is missing. No tofu even.Canyoneering is becoming more popular, and there is a great need for accurate information to aid people in keeping themselves safe and from getting lost. Many people are venturing out there with little or no specific knowledge about how the sport is done safely and with minimal impact. If you are looking for help with this, you'll have to wait for Rich Carlson's Canyoneering Technique Book, because you certainly won't get it from this embarrassing waste of wood pulp."
5,Canyoneering,Very nice. A good resource for the beginner to be properly prepared. Or a good review and resource for the advanced Canyoneer. Nicely done with good format and layout. An easy reference source for details of information.
5,Jazz Guitar Players Take Note,"For you advanced guitar players interested in jazz; this DVD is a must have. If you don't learn something from Mastro Bruno, they'll give you your money back. The DVD makes for a wonderful Christmas gift; regardless of one's level of playing.Frets at Thin Lizard Studio"
2,Incorrect Answers,"Some of the answers to the questions are incorrect or make no sense at all. It is very frustrating. You wonder, how did this book get published with so many obviously wrong answers. The author also takes the time to explain some of the answers and how they are arrived at, but rest assured they are the easy ones that anyone with half a brain could get and the ones that are somewhat challenging will just have a one number answer, which in some cases is completely wrong.However, it is still fun for passing time while on the pot. And my girlfriend and I do enjoy over-analyzing each problem and complaining about the author's inability to correctly answer the questions that he creates!So go ahead and enjoy ...the frustration and agony of not knowing whether or not the answer you spent so many minutes deducing is truly wrong or if the author just wrote down some random number to push you to the bounds of insanity and beyond!"
2,WOW - just really bad.....(and I like their brownies!),"So I do love my sweets but I try to eat healthier versions of them, so I tried these. But, really, the flax seed COMPLETELY overwhelms the muffins, so much that that's ALL you taste! Maybe the whole wheat contributes to this, too - I don't know. But you DEFINITELY cannot taste the blueberries, and they are just bland, bland, bland....Wanted to like them, but I couldn't. Try their brownies, though - not as fluffy or creamy as a regular brownie, but still very good and chocolate-y! (satisfies your chocolate urge, but you don't feel the need to eat the whole pan!)"
1,be aware!,"why put this item in a set with gluten free products? This is maybe a good product but we are totally gluten free and now I am having to return it, a total waste of my time! Please be aware of this"
2,yuck!,i used one box and the other five boxes are just sitting around in my kitchen. i got these because of the reviews but i don't like the way they taste so i guess the others will be going to waste.
5,Love this mix,I received this mix and decided to try the pancakes first. WOW! My husband just loves blueberries and couldn't believe the flavor and amount of dried fruit for this powdered mix. I can't wait to bake the muffins. I love knowing that we are eating healthier even if they are a mix.
1,Didn't pass the kid test,"I even put sprinkles on top but my kids wouldn't eat these. I knew when the batter didn't even taste good and they didn't want to lick the spoon we were in trouble. I didn't like them, either. Very gritty and just don't taste good."
1,No taste,The muffiins had absolutely no taste. I added some extra sweetener and some ginger and cinnamon and they tasted much better.
1,Hodgson Whole Wheat Blueberry muffin mix,My family found this product to be very dry and not much taste. I tried adding applesauce to the mix but it didnt help.
2,Not as good as it could be,"Well, good morning family, here try this! Himself- ""It tastes like eating a tree""... The son- ""tastes like a ground up tree"" The daughter, ""I'm not touching those things"" sigh. hm, where did I go wrong? I read the directions followed them and wallah! Muffins that are super good for you that taste like, tree. Oh boy. Here is where I went wrong. I trusted the directions. Next time, use brown sugar, even a substitute would be better am a diabetic as is Himself. I try to foist as much healthy food onto him that I can. Next, put real blueberries from my freezer in to the batter. The package said their dried berries would ""plump"" up. Nope, they just sorta rode the baking process out, the same size as they went in. When a person wants a muffin it is for a very specific reason. Comfort and deliciousness. While these may provide 'regularity' darn fast (sorry, tmi?), they are not comfort food.Will revisit upon my next attempt with a revamp."
4,better with a sprinkle of sugar on top,"Most muffin mixes out there have so much sugar they are essentially cupcakes. Not these. That said, perhaps because my palette is used to a sweeter muffin I found myself wanting a spread of butter on them (which I would never do with, say, a Betty Crocker muffin). The second batch I made I sprinkled a little sugar on top and added some extra blueberries; that helped quite a bit. My kiddos think they're great either way; that's a great after school snack for them to come home to. Another reviewer summed it up well by saying they are good, not great. I will buy them again just because they are healthy. Remember that in terms of rating foods, one person's 5 stars is another person's 1 star. It's a matter of personal preference."
5,If you eat healthy you will like these,My family eats extremely healthy natural foods and we try to stay away from a lot of sugar and white flour. I tried these when they were on sale and I have to say my kids love them. I make them in my mini muffin pans so there are more of them. I have also taken them to a friend's house and all my girlfriends there LOVED them. I suppose if you are used to eating store bought muffins or mixes with all kinds of sugars/white flour in them you might not like them. If you are used to eating more natural foods I think it's a good choice.
3,Taste okay but nothing special...,"These are okay. They are healthy, so I'll say that. But, they were pretty heavy and had a lot of calories for one little muffin."
1,Bait and Switch! Not what is in the picture.,"I have owned a West Bend timer (the one pictured) for several years and love everything about it. However, the timers that I received today were not the timer in the picture. The timers I received have small white hard plastic buttons, a screen half the size of the real West Bend timer, and the way the time is entered is different and non-intuitive. There is no ""West Bend"" name anywhere on the timers. The plastic is noticably flimsier as well. Frankly, it is not even a decent attempt at a knockoff.If you want to buy the real West Bend timer, buy it from another supplier. Hopefully Amazon has another source besides this supplier."
5,"Incredibly versatile, easy to use timer","First, I just love the loud timer. Even with a large, loud middle school class, I can hear the timer clearly. Setting the timer is a snap. Simply enter the minutes and seconds (or hours, minutes, and seconds if you wish), press Start, and you're all set. There are even the ten digits on the timer to facilitate the process. It can stand by itself on a desk, or I can use the magnetic back to attach it to my marker board. The days of the old wind-up bell timer are over for me!"
1,Beware Bait and Switch By Guniang Seller!!!,"I ordered five West Bend digital timers at an incredible price, now I know why! I received five no-name brand timers without battery (description states battery will be included). I have just contacted seller for a refund. Buyer beware!"
3,West Bend timer,We were somewhat dissapointed in the timer. It does not automatically reset to the prior set time and the sound is rather harsh
3,"Good, but buttons stick","It's a great timer, but occasionally the start/stop button gets stuck. I only had it for a few weeks before it started doing that. Love the size/magnet/clip overall."
3,This was a gift,I have a similar timer I bought from pampered chef. I use it all the time. I gave this as a gift to my daughter
3,Worked Fine Until It Dropped,"Positives:1. Clear, readable buttons and display - no squinting and trying to guess whether or not it's set correctly.2. Easy to set time from one minute to however many hours.3. LOVE the ""Start"" ""Stop/Reset"" button!Negatives:1. Magnet is very weak. I would recommend keeping it on the lower part of the stove. Setting it on the hood ended it's life prematurely when it fell on it's own."
3,setting confused me; I'm no rocket scientist..,"I have the West Bend from ages ago...it has hours, minutes, seconds buttons, and clear...this one has a much less intuitive setting mechanism. I liked the precious one because it uses a AAA battery...I also have a West Bend that used a hearing aid battery and lost it...fine...good...gone. It took me a while to be able to set the count down function without the 3 button design of the former west bend. I know...it's progress...now I know how my father must have felt when the cockpit of the car was re-designed."
3,Direct enter timer,"Didn't know if I would use the direct input feature, but wanted to try it. Love it and makes life much easier.Down side is the clip on the back is very light weight and is breaking apart already. It will end up on counter or in a drawer."
5,"dialing numbers, instead of having to go up or down is great.","I have had several timers over the years. This one is great. Manual timers that you turn the dial are usually off. the ones that you add 1 minute of 1 hour at a time are very time comsuming, and are hard to do if you have artheritis."
2,West Ben Digital timer,The controls on this timer work backward to others I have used. It's kind of a nuisance. I tried to reset it the other day and I had to wait until the time ran out before I could put a new time in.
4,KIS,Keep it Simple with Amazon.....finding the timer i was looking for was easy! I had one for my business which was the old model and I have had it for 15+ years (still working fine) but needed more - so for long jevity why get something else!?I cant give it 5 stars as i dont love it...its a timer... but i do like it and i bought 4 (work purposes) It does what i need it to do both stop watch and timer modes available.LOVE amazon though....super service.
1,If I had only known..,"If I had known that you needed a timer and you lived next door, I would gladly walk over and give you this one. I have used timers of many manufacturers for many years and this is the most worthless unit I have experienced. If you need to do repeats of the same length, you must enter the number over and over. And the entry is a very long process, not reasonable like Sunbeam. It's your choice, of course, but I would avoid the model.I am having to order another model that will function as I wish."
3,A caveat,"This is really such a simple device and works better than the one it replaced. The problem we have had is that the case does not sit flat against the refrigerator when attached with the magnet. When you go to press the start or stop button, the unit flips off the surface because there is nothing behind the button to suport it. Ours has ended-up on the floor several times and the magnet has broken-off. The hinges for the magnet-stand are very flimsy. I will fix it somehow. It's too bad because it works great as a timer."
2,crap,Three timers arrived not one. However two out of three didn't work. But I only thought I was getting one. Was going to return but for the low cost I just kept the one
4,"Great timer, not-so-great magnet back","Works great, but tended to fall on the floor when we pressed the buttons, and after a few falls the magnet on the back broke off at the hinges. Since then we've been holding it to the fridge with a giant magnetic clip, and it continues to work fine.OXO Chip Bag Clip Set, Assorted Colors"
1,"Great timer, if you only need one for 8 months","Yes, this timer died on me after 8 months of use. First it became nonresponsive to the keys (so I thought the battery was low), then after replacing the battery it wouldn't display anything at all. Cheap Chinese junk."
5,Great,There are few timers that let you type in the time rather than gradually counting up from zero. The extra buttons cost a few dollars but they save lots of time and aggravation.
2,Not so crazy about it,"I didn't like this timer too much because when placed on the 'fridge with the magnet, it is not sturdy. For example, you press the number one and the whole thing falls because the magnet is only in the very center. Since the magnet sticks out about 1/2"", the whole device moves when any side number is pushed. Also, there is no auto-shut off for the frighteningly loud beeper. So, it will beep and beep and beep."
3,"Does the job, but has major design flaws","I bought three of these for my group's annual canning marathons.Pros: Has a nice, loud beep. Ten key system makes it easy to set. Will allow you to set the time, walk away, and start it later without reverting to zero. Has so far lasted the summer without running down the battery or developing any electrical problems.Defects: The magnet and stand arrangement on the back makes it stand much too far out from the fridge, and is easy caught on clothes and snapped off. The hinge that attaches the stand to the timer is a very flimsy plastic, and pretty much can't stand any jostling whatsoever. None of the stands on these lasted more than a month.Conclusion: If West Bend would fix the stand problem, I'd give this time five stars."
1,Not good,"Even at the cheaper price on Amazon, this timer is not worth the money. It's difficult to see the numbers and unless you are within a few feet, the alarm can't be heard. As for attaching it to a metal surface with the magnet...forget it. I sent it back."
4,"Office Timer, With Easy Modification (Mute to Turn Off Sound)","This timer beeps LOUDLY every time you start or stop it. I wanted to mute it so I could use it in my office without annoying everyone.This was an easy fix. I unscrewed the back with a #0 philips head screwdriver. Then I carefully snipped the black wire leading to the speaker (a saucer shaped tin thing about half an inch across). No more chirping!Took less than ten minutes, and it was so easy, anyone could do it. Note: only cut the wire leading to the speaker, do NOT cut the wire coming from the battery! (Or you will break the device.)"
3,Unfortunately....,"Unfortunately I had to return mine... the clasp on the back breaks very easily.I really wanted to keep it because I got a TON of use out of it the few days I had it.. there is a magnet on the back, as well as a mini ""kick"" stand so you have options for where to put it. The top of the stove, on the fan guard was perfect while making bagels because it has a stopwatch feature and I just started it and would watch for 2 minutes to pass as my bagels boiled. Stuck on the fridge was perfect for longer baking times.... I sure will miss you 'lil timer... we bonded well, but at nearly $15, you must go back if you can't stand up or stick up... I will miss you... XD"
4,"Easy to use, easy to read","Kitchen timers don't need to do anything fancy. They should be able to count up, count down, beep when the timer is done. They should be durable, easy to read, easy to use, and stable. Lastly, they should be nice enough looking that you won't want to keep them hidden in the drawer. This timer is all of those things. I use it mainly as an espresso shot timer, and it works rather well for that. I start the timer before the shot, then adjust the target time accordingly (e.g. adding 5 seconds). Instead of timing down to a beep, I use the stopwatch feature. It's got a magnetic back, so it can attach to the side of my machine when not in use, but also has a fold-out kickstand so it can stand up. The angle when using the kickstand makes it easy to read."
2,"Good Electronics, Terrible Quality Housing","The timer's ELECTRONIC parts, function, and design are excellent. The loud beeping alarm is particularly valuable. However, the mechanical housing, particularly the plastic hinge assembly, is terrible. The frail plastic hinge broke after only a couple weeks of very gentle handling. We will end up gluing a magnet onto the back of the timer so we can continue to use it, as it spends the vast majority of its time magnetically attached to the front of the hood over the stove. It's a shame to see such a useful, simple to use tool be so badly handicapped by an atrocious mechanical design and execution. Shame on the manufacturer and their quality control engineers for producing such a badly flawed product."
5,for reminders at my desk,"I bought this for my desk to remind me of appointments, etc. It works. It is nice that it turns itself off so if I am no longer at my desk, it doesn't ring forever."
3,Not a bad timer,"I like this timer because you can input the exact number of minutes rather than having to hold down a minute or hour key to count up. . . and it works fine. The downsides: the alarm is shrill and there's no reset (there's a reset button, but it just clears the time). If you want to use the same time interval again, you have to reinput it each time."
2,Disappointed,"After our 2 year old threw away our Pampered Chef timer, we tried this timer, hoping it would be similar. It worked fine for a timer in the beginning, but now it shorts out while running at times and often I have to take the battery in and out to get it to work again for me (even after putting in a new battery). I should have just put the money into another Pampered Chef timer and got what I really wanted."
3,Kitchen timer - Old vs. New,"I own and still use an old ""Galleon"" kitchen timer. I wanted a coiuple of new ones and bought the similar ""West Bend"" timer. The old timer has an On/Off switch, the new one does not. The pitch of the signal note on the new unit is higher than the old and(for me) harder to hear. When set on ""count dpwn"" mode the old timer signaled at time out but kept on running so you could see how many minutes you had gone over. The new one just signals and sets to zero. Both have 60 second end signals. The new timer is blockier (less slim) than the old one. All of the above noted the new ones sit next to the old one and do get used some. They seem to time accurately. This old goat still prefers the old features."
3,good timer,"This is a good timer, the beeping is loud and it also stands up on your counter or sticks to your refrigerator. I just wish that it shut off so that the battery doesn't drain."
2,Good but fragile,"I like this timer because you can press one button for each hour/minute to set it, in other words, you don't need to press the minute button 30 times to set it for 30 minutes. But it's not a very sturdy timer. I dropped it once, the display cracked and now it no longer works. I've had my Pyrex timer for a good many years, dropped it more times than I can remember and it still going strong. If you purchase this timer, be sure it's secured so it won't fall."
3,Timer alarm sound is weak,"I bought this timer in part because other reviews claimed its alarm was loud. However, the one I received was barely audible. It seems a matter of luck as to whether you get a good one or not. In other respects, the unit is quite good. The buttons have a soft touch and a good detente. Also, one can directly enter the desired time rather than having to scroll up by holding down buttons."
2,Easy to knock off refrigerator,"Pros: Easy to set, has a loud alarm.Cons: Teeters on the refrigerator magnet attachment. My mom went to push a button, knocked it off the fridge and the magnet's thin plastic attachment broke. Now it must sit on the counter when in use."
1,Got a defective timer,I got a timer with a malfunctioning LED display. One of the digits did not display properly.I returned it.
2,NOT A GOOD TIMER!!!,"i am a bit of a timer afficionado, and i am here to tell you, this is not a good timer. it has two primary problems: (1) too many buttons (most timers just have three) and (2) WAY TOO LOUD. if you are going to make a timer this loud, you should give the consumer a switch to make it quieter. if you are going to have your timer far far away from you, maybe this is the one for you."
3,"Reads like a Term paper, but with some valuable info...","3 and 1/2 stars. A straight-forward account of the Crisis that has the essence of a college term paper...there is some value here in that you get Mr. Whites' analysis/views on the approaches taken by Kennedy and EXCOMM with the perspective of 34 years, but there are better and more readable accounts of the Crisis out there."
1,Finicky cat would not even taste this!,"We have a 10 year old cat who is extremely finicky and he absolutely, positively would not even taste this. We tried many different ways (going through several cans) including just a teaspoon full with his normal canned food and he would take one sniff and walk away. We were very disappointed because we had read several great reviews. The company was wonderful and are allowing us to return the rest of the cans (we bought an entire case). So, only buy a few cans at first to see if your cat will eat this. On the other hand, we also bought the dry kibble made by Instinctive Choice and my cat LOVES this. Go figure."
2,Canned Cat Food,"Recommended by our Vet and I'm sure it's very healthy, but taste or smell didn't cut it as none of our cats (3) would touch it."
1,Worst customer service,Orders are incorrect; sales people have no idea what is going on and are unfriendly. I am surprised that Amazon has partnered with them.
2,Not so easy for beginners,"I expected more. The yarn is fun, pretty & soft; the beads are a neat accent; but it was very difficult for my 9 year old niece to do. She wanted to learn how to crochet, but this was not a good way to start. The description said, ""an easy-to-do craft for beginners,"" but I thought it was more appropriate for those who already know how to crochet. The type of yarn that is provided is really what makes it so tough. My niece wasn't able to see her stitches, let alone count them, and she got frustrated with it and gave up (& she's not one to give up easily)."
1,Argumentative History,"Cortesi's book argues about numbers of ships involved, planes, air groups involved, losses and even positions. It seems like a fruitless set of arguments, and he can't offer war-records anymore than he offers sources for his numerous ""personal conversations"" and ""quotes"" from the participants. While McAulay's book is so confusing because of duplicate war-reports, at least he offers reasons for his book's vast confusion. Cortesi doesn't - he just argues, just to argue with Samuel Morison's version as if this makes his book more sellable.But it's not very readable. And difficult to believe because of the vast number of ""personal conversations"" he invents."
2,"Nice looking, BUT very fragile","I bought several of these frames and I had a lot of prints to frame and like d the clean lines, and low cost.I really like the look of floating glass frames, and it provides more options for your photos or art.The problem with these frames is that like many things made in China, they are cheap...at great cost.The glass broke from the pressure of putting those little tabs that hold it together down, and (as someone who works with glass) I know that this type of break only occurs in glass which is not properly annealed.What does this mean to you? It is DANGEROUS!!! A product like this should be made with either safety glass, hard glass (pyrex, borosilicate) or, at the very least, properly annealed soft glass (actually any & all of these glasses should be annealed to remove stress)...but, without getting too technical- all I can say is that the glass in this product is unsuitable for it's purpose, and fundamentally unsafe."
3,Not what I expected!,"I expected for these frames to have a ""walnut"" finish, but they looked like a cherry wood finish to me, totally defeated the purpose, I returned them. If you're looking for frames in a cherry wood finish, you might love these!"
5,Outstanding devotional,"I have an old version of this Prayer Book and would like to have one updated from usages of ""thee"" etc. However, as a devotional it includes many old and beautiful prayers, litanies, novenas, and 2 Holy Hours, and more. Though it was a product of the an Episcopal Monastery in New York, I have used it for years even though I am now Catholic. I highly recommend this devotional to any who desire a good prayer book with which to enrich their prayer life."
1,Stitching failed right away - Need to throw away,Unacceptable level of quality. A drumstick bag should be able to hold sticks without failing. Would not recommend at all.
4,Adequate for Most,"For most percussionists, this bag will probably be adequate to their needs. The construction seems to be fairly sturdy, and has held up well in the few years I've had it. Mine holds a few pairs of drumsticks, a few pairs of keyboard mallets, and a set of timpani mallets in addition to having room for a drum key and a pitch pipe. A more serious player may find it inadequate for a larger number of mallets, though."
4,Quality basic bag,"A good basic bag. Doesn't hold a lot of mallets, but excellent for sticks. A good starter bag for a new student."
2,Not Zildjian quality,"It has a convenient features, including hooks to hang it on the floor tom and an outside zipper bag for other items. However, the stitching at the bottom did not last. My sticks just fall out onto the floor. I'll have to spend a little more and buy something sturdier."
5,Drum stick Bag,Great Drumstick Bag.I even have a place to hold my metronom.It can hold more than one pair if sticks.I think like four pairs of sticks or more.
5,Excellent must have book for the Russian Blue cat lover!!!,Excellent all around book explaining the believed origin of the beautiful Russian Blue cat breed. A must have for anyone seriously considering adding one of these beautiful creatures to their lives!!!
5,100% Satisfied,"Incredibly sturdy and elegant. I did my research before deciding on this tie rack and I'm glad I did. I would recommend this to anyone! The shelf design is great, the craftmanship is fantastic and the price can't be beat. This was a gift for my boyfriend and he LOVES it. If you're looking for a tie rack BUY THIS ONE. You will not regret it."
5,Very nice,"I love this tie rack. The shelf on the top is not only functional but it keeps dust off your ties. Also, my old rack held 36 ties and they were spaced too close together. This one is space perfectly."
1,A crapy product,"Please don't buy it unless you also buy insurance or replacement plan. I order it from Amazon and product was flawed. Its two barrels were not alligned and it showed two non-overlaping images. So I asked for an exchange and got one. But when I used it outside for the first time in Grand Canyon, one of its eye-piece came out and now it has transformed from a binocular to monocular. I really hate this product. It got it for $30. I could have got much better product from another manufacturer for less."
2,CUTE but too TINY and LIGHT WEIGHT TO WORK,"Bought this and the one with the bristles to go outside Side entrance for all to use before entering. Trouble is, both are tiny, not weighted well and no one seems be able to clean shoes with either one, they just fall over. After three months making matters worse, this one began to rust. One more thing, the bristle one- that is to say, the Scotty dog is larger, it is not just the bristles making it appear larger - so they don't coordinate as well as I hoped. I had planned to sink in some concrete to try and stabilize but with the rust now being a problem, think I may just pitch. Learning curve, hope my experience helps others avoid spending good money badly."
3,Short Bald Guy,"I haven't actuly seen ""Hazels People"" all the way though, but from what I have seen it seems like it may be interesting to some. I like it mostly because one of my teachers was in it, and at one point he's refered to as ""The short bald guy"" and its interesting to see that even when he was younger he was bald. =p But the over all premis of the movie does seem slightly entriging."
5,Treat for Detective Fans,"Fans of detective stories will love Mysterious Persons in History that explores controversial unsolved mysteries such as Jack the Ripper, Harry Oaks, Lizzie Borden, Napoleon and others. Each person is covered in a separate chapter where fascinating facts and questions related to this person are explored. The reader gets a chance to ponder and resolve each of these cases. It is great fun to work with the facts supplied to solve these time tested mysteries. Mysterious Persons is a terrific way to learn history and practice problem solving at the same time as enjoying true life mystery cases."
2,Came Broken,"The frame was broken at two edges. The box it came in was fine and the corners were secured with cardboards so this was NOT a shipping issue. Glass for front and back are great but the material this frame is made up of is flimsy. Despite that, it would still look great on the wall if only the frame had arrived in a single piece. I should have returned it but managed to superglue and hang it anyways which sadly also means no other picture will ever go in this frame. Looks good on the wall. Hoping no one gets too close to it."
3,Beautiful when properly made,"These are beautiful, and unlike many inexpensive frames, they don't look a bit cheap. Unfortunately, they are apparently not made to very precise specs.We ordered six. Two worked perfectly. Two required me to squeeze the backing glass out verrrrrry carefully. And the remaining two are unusable because the backing glass is too large and cannot be removed from the frame. So there is a little bit of a risk here. But when you draw ones that are properly made, they are gorgeous."
1,both frames damaged,"I purchased one of the Umbra 11 x 14"" frames to judge the quality and liked it. So, I purchased two more. Both frames had damaged corners that leave the frame almost unusable. Given the cost and aggravation of mailing back the product I'm going to try to glue the damaged corners together and make it work, but not happy!"
3,"Good value, poor build quality","I bought several of these frames this past holiday season so to give some 8x12 photographs as presents. Amazon packs these frames well, but alas the glass was still broken on one. Having this sorted out with Amazon was anything but smooth, however I am here to rate the frame not the retailer.For the price, these frames are a decent value for framing 8""x12"" prints. Decent. Nothing more.These frames are aesthetically pleasing and are very easy to assemble. I would suggest wearing rubber gloves while handling the glass, as to minimize fingerprints. The first problem is the adhesive used to hold the sample paper between the panes of glass. It leaves a residue even after taking acetone to the adhesive. Secondly the frame itself is made not from wood or plastic, but a foam composite. Dropping it on carpet caused the frame irreparable damage. But again, you get what you pay for. In the future I would look for a sturdier frame."
1,Poor quality,Came with a great packaging. That's about it. Frame is a black plastic frame covered with with a poor quality nickel color.Had something looked like a scratch on arrival. In fact the painting was already pealing. Black beneath showing. Repainted it...Stay away
1,Disappointed,"I usually love Umbra products, but unfortunately both the glass and the frame broke almost immediately as I was trying to frame something for the first time. Bummer."
3,Sizing not consistent,"The frame is nice -- we are using them for two-sided letters written by a famous guy, and it's great that so we can take them off the wall and show off both sides. However, I bought one on 10/21 and one on 11/4 and they're slightly different sizes! It's not a huge difference -- probably less than a centimeter -- but it's noticeable with the two frames hanging side by side. In the bigger frame, the black edge is a bit bigger too. It's a real bummer given how much we like the frames in all other regards."
3,"Very nice, but . . .","The frame is simple and attractive, exactly what I wanted at this price. I would have rated it at 4 or even 5, except that the glass came with a large, visible scratch in it. Luckily, this product comes with two pieces of glass to enable a ""floating"" effect for smaller photos or documents, and the document that I was framing was itself 11 x 14. I pried off the front, scratched piece of glass (it is lightly glued into place) and replaced it with the back, unscratched piece of glass. In the end, then, it worked out -- but if I had bought the frame with the intent to ""float"" a smaller photo, I would have been quite irritated to have to return the product due to the scratch."
4,Good Frame; As Described,"The product was as described. It seems to be of pretty high quality and hangs nicely on the wall. If you're looking for a basic, no frills frame of this size/color, you can't go wrong with this product."
2,i little cheap looking,"i guess for the price it is okay. i did not expect too much... but it was a little less than what i expected for the price. it was the right size. the frame is very cheap plastic, i was hoping for some kind of metal."
1,Not comparable to other Umbra frames,"I buy the Umbra document frames often, primarily the black frames. This was the first time I bought the Bronze option. The quality of this frame was terrible. The hinged closures on the back that hold the glass in were too tight, and had to be loosened then re-tightened with a Phillips screwdriver. These frames are plastic, but with the black frames, they always looked very slick and modern, even possibly wood from afar. The quality of this plastic was bad, and the frame width itself was at least a 1/4"" smaller than on the other Umbras I've purchased.Getting this frame made me nervous, as I am concerned for the future quality of all of these frames. If I find others are built with similar poor quality, I will post again and be contacting the company."
3,"look nice, broke almost immediately!",Dropped 2 of the frames from a max of maybe 2 feet and the frames shattered completely beyond repair. They look really nice and I want to love them but unfortunately I have to write that I am disappointed in the quality of the product.
2,Careful-- glass sometimes does not come out of frame,"I bought eight of these in various sizes (11x14 and 13x16). For some of the 11x14 frames, the glass was really wedged into the frame, and I was afraid that I was going to break the glass trying to ease it out. Sure enough, one of them broke. For the others, I was able to ease it out.Otherwise, they're perfectly OK frames for the value. If you're hanging them, note that the way the hooks are attached to the frame, the force the frame to stand out a little bit from the wall. Also, when you hang the 13x16 frames sideways (landscape instead of portrait), the top edge frame (where the hooks are) bends slightly, causing a slight curve. I think it has to do with the fact that the frame is made of firm but slightly pliable material."
5,Great Quality!!,"I bought 2 of these frames and they are very well made, plus such an amazing price! Just cant beat it. Highly recommend these frames."
5,Nice quality for the price,"I bought one in late October to frame a print I bought from one of my favorite photographers. I was hesitant at first because of the price, but since I also had free two-day shipping, I figured ""why not?"" I'm glad I bought this one, honestly. Not only was it well-protected during shipping and arrived on time, but it looks great with black and white photography. The double layers of glass (one for the front, one for the back) give your photo, poster, or document extra protection. It's definitely worth the $[...]. Even the photographer that I bought the print from was surprised that the frame went so nicely with his photo. I definitely plan on buying another one of these frames soon."
2,Size Was Off,"I purchased this in black previously, and it worked perfect for a 11x14 collage I had. I made several more collages, and ordered black & nickel. Some reason the nickel frames' dimensions were off. I double checked my collage size and even put it in the black frames with no problem, but they would not fit in the nickel frame. I ended up having to trim the collage to fit, so I will not be ordering the nickel frames again."
1,poor design,"I ordered two of these and they both had the same problem: the glass backing is too tight in the frame. With one frame, I was able to get the glass out and put my picture in without much issue. But with the other one, the glass was so tightly fitted and difficult to remove that it felt like it might break before I even managed to get it out all the way. I should have stopped trying and just returned the frame, but instead I kept trying to coax out the glass and ended up breaking it. Since it was partly my fault I didn't try to return the broken frame or complain, but I would absolutely not recommend this frame to other people."
2,Misleading,"I bought two frames, one for me and one for my dad for a picture I got him for Christmas. Unfortunately, the glass on one was broken upon arrival. The other was still intact so I set about framing the picture for my dad. The information I received about size was misleading and the 11x14 picture did not fit. Apparently, the frame itself is 11x14, not the space for the picture/poster/diploma. I had to cut off part of the picture to make it fit. It is a great buy for a smaller photo, just be prepared for a frame too small for a 11x14, what it was made to hold, fyi Umbra."
4,Better Than Expected,"I ordered two of these, expecting them to be cheap, but serviceable. I was pleasantly surprised to find them to be very well made and sturdy. There is a 2nd piece of glass that is the backing, with a handy pull-tab attached for removal (see pictures). No need to smudge up the glass."
5,Great frames to display two-sided pictures.,"I have bought 10 Umbra frames to frame double sided pictures. They are great quality, makes my pictures look beautiful,and great price,shipping fast and no broken pieces. Amazon did a great job."
1,Not metal...,I'm usually very pleased with Umbra frames and thought I found exactly I needed. But I did not. It is plastic - the entire frame is plastic. The description says it is metal - brushed nickel. It is not at all. I'm very disappointed and frustrated.
5,Great Priced Frame,"This frame is wonderfully designed. While made of cheap and affordable materials, the design allows for the glass to easily be moved when inserting the document itself.Other frames of similar intent have broken on me while trying to get it settled, but the Umbra frame presented no annoyances.Great design, looks nice and very affordable. Will be buying another."
3,"Not beautiful, but decent value","I had hoped this frame would have more of a copper/bronze finish, but it looks more basic brown. Nontheless, it worked well with my large print, and was easy to load."
2,Cheaply made,I probably should have returned these frames. They are so cheaply made that they are basically falling apart on delivery.
1,Not Worth the Frustration,"After spending approximately 30 minutes trying to separate the two pieces of glass, the front glass cracked completely across the middle. The ""tool"" that's supposed to be used to separate the glasses is a plastic tab that's sticky on one side. Unfortunately, only one corner of the black glass moved at all when pulling the tab. I suppose for two hours I could have tried reapplying the tab at each corner and pulling it back again, but the tab broke as well. Horrible product, STAY AWAY!!!"
1,Completely fell apart!!,I bought this frame this past February and it just fell apart and shattered on my floor!!! My engineering husband said that the frame itself was poorly designed and the weight of the double glass was not well supported by the cheap plastic frame. Bummer! Thankfully our artwork suffered minimal damage. Buy it if you don't plan to hang on the wall!!!
1,Beware: SCAM!!,"Beware, this seller is a scammer. I ordered a nice set of frames that were to be two panels of glass that created a ""floating"" effect with the pictures. I placed my order at the end of November, wanting the frames for a Christmas gift. No frames came... I contacted the seller who promptly replied with nice apologies and promises of quick repair. She begged me not to leave bad feedback. Well, the replacement package arrived, and what I found was plastic frames with an acrylic (not glass) pane, with a cardboard backing (no floating effect there). The value for the frames that were sent to me no where near matched the expected value. This seller has no return or refund policy, and the seller has not replied to any more of my emails requesting return/refund information. Nice to be scammed at Christmas..."
2,A Jewel in His Crown,"This book is well written and entertaining. However, I felt like the author does a lot of name dropping causing the reader (who may not know all those ""famous"" people) to wonder if the author is genuine in who she knows or if she is overly proud of who she knows. And although the book quotes a lot of scripture, keep in mind that the entire book is the author's INTERPRETATION of those scriptures. Some are more stretched than others, but it is based on opinion. But with all that said, if you can see past that you will pick up a few tips on self esteem and seeing yourself as God sees you. I do think there are better books out there though, at least I hope so."
2,Not what I thought,"This book was ok. Seeing all the reviews here on Amazon made me have high expectations, since it was all 4 and 5 stars. Some people said it was life changing...I wouldn't go that far. If you want something that has the same message but is more inspirational, read a Michelle McKinney Hammond book. She says similar things but in a fun, uplifting way that actually makes you feel good about yourself and have a renewed zest for the Lord. I don't think I'll reread this book. I gave it two stars because it has a positive message that women should hear, but there are other books that can say it better."
5,A Jewel of a book!,"This book was sitting on my shelf for about 6 months before I picked it up to read it...let me tell you I could barely put it down!I kept saying to myself...why didn't I read this before...I was going thru a very trying period in my life and it has been such a blessing to me!People thought I was crazy cause I kept speaking and laughing with her!(Good Book Promotion! )Mrs.Shire is so forthright and personable,her grace shines right thru!It is written with such familiarity,you cant help but feel as if she is speaking to you.Therein lies the gift of the Holy Spirit,He does speak to us thru His people!You would do well to get this book,it will be just what you need!She has let the Lord use her and if you were not convinced before of your worth,you will be after you read this!I think I'll start reading it again...just for the enjoyment!"
2,No. Don't buy this.,"I have been buying these before (from Microcenter). They are very cheap and I thought it was a very good deal. Particularly their 2600mAh for 4 for 5 bucks! But...Cons:-Of all the NiMh batteries I tried. This has the most number of failures. Some just dies. Some would hold very low charges after just a few cycles.-It is bigger in circumference compared to other batteries. Which will not fit some of my cameras and gadgets.-Exterior is made of paper and gets easily smashed, deformed.Pros:-Price. but for this kind of quality... not worth it.Also: With all the new low discharge batteries flooding the market (Eneloops, Rayovacs, Duracell, Kodak, etc.) There is no longer any reason to buy this kind of batteries. Even this company is now manufacturing their own Hybrio."
1,Taste better than the Orange...,"This juice tastes MUCH better than it's Orange Weight Loss counterpart, however, it was NOT effective at all. I noticed no difference in my weight or body functions with this juice. I bought 2 together (one for myself and one for my boyfriend) to start as part of our new healthy resolution. Neither of us experienced a decrease on the scale...even after a few days. ::BOOOOO!::I've tried the orange flavor before (the huge bottle) and it is sooooooooooo gross. If you can choke it down, it does work...I lost 5 pounds after drinking it. (over the following 2 days combined) But, stay close to the restroom. =)"
2,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed and more than a little shocked when I received this print. It was advertised as a poster print. What it should have said was post card. Although the picture is cute, I feel like I was ripped off. The box it, and the other one I bought along with it, were shipped in was HUGE. These ""postcards"" would have fit into a regular envelope.Next time be more accurate in your descriptions and titles, buddy. It would save a lot of headache."
2,grandma3,"I expected the picture to be bigger, I also had to buy a frame for it. It did not state the size and that it came without a frame."
3,"Full of feeling, but...","I was so excited about this book, and it delivered what it claimed. The art in this book is full of such a range of emotions it will take you back to high school and slap you with all of those feelings you thought you'd forgotten.My only complaint? I would have liked to seen more of the original notes. I'm not sure if it's a privacy violation to print them, or if the author simply decided to leave a majority of them out for her own reasons, but I feel that they would have been more powerful on their own."
1,"Good things to do, but not to make someone feel ""special""","I got this book hoping it would be as it claimed--things to do to make someone in your life feel special and happy. There are only a couple that apply.While things in this book may be nice thing to do in general, chances are that being an organ donor, giving blood, donating old items to charity, or finding cancer patients and offering to drive them to the hospital won't make your friends & family specifically feel appreciated or happy unless they are the cancer patient, or are the ones who need blood. These could be considered nice things to do in the universe, and could make you feel better about yourself for doing such.I was disappointed because I was looking for little things to do for my own family & friends to make them happy, and this book only has maybe two useful ideas in the book directed towards that."
2,Tool lags in performance,"Clean the outside of the plug Okay, but does not clean the underside or inside to well."
1,Doesn't work!,Actually i didnt get this for myself but my grandpa has one and says it does NOT work!I do NOT reccomend this product!
2,"hegehog, fox ,and magister's pox by stephen jay gould",This is the 22nd and last book of the late author. It attmepts to bridge his pereived gap between science and the humanities. It does not achieve this goal and is an unfocused and irritating book full of hubris and unrelated musings. It is not recommended.
4,Review of Gould's 'Hedgehog and Fox',"I borrowed this together with Wilson's 'Consilience,' and after being disappointed by WIlson had fairly low expectations for this work. However, I instead found a great measure of appreciation for Gould's voice as an author and his concern for coherency in a work which is largely a collection of essays. Taking Wilson's model, Gould puts it to greater use by making a sustain, mostly historical argument for the majority of the work. He then breaks off for an extended criticism of Wilson's original work, which, admittedly, itself sinks into many of the pitfalls I saw in 'Consilience.' This is essentially one old man ramblings given in response to another old man ramblings. However, I credit this old man for being more articulate, better at sustaining and argument, and for showing a more genuine appreciation of the humanities as a discipline."
1,Condescending Rip-off,"I purchased this set of books and returned them to Amazon, insulted that I had spent even a few dollars on such condescending pablum.The information is overly simple and, in some places, quite outdated technically. Book 1, about starting a business, is not so bad, but you could certainly purchase a better book on the general topic of starting a business for probably less money.Book 2 is simply technical trash. If you truly know nothing about making websites, you should probably either hire someone or else or use a generator, like GoLive Cyberstudio or even MS Frontpage. The little bit of HTML you might learn from this book isn't enough to get you anywhere, and furthermore, you could find a better HTML primer on the web for free (just run a search for ""learn HTML"")."
1,Author sponsored feedback fools no one,"It's been quite a while since I first reviewed this pamphlet, and predictably, I return to this page and find that the majority of the reviews and ratings of the reviews are as bogus as the books themselves. A quick review of this feedback should convince everyone that the author has a serious integrity problem. Save your money and your time-this publication will teach you nothing."
4,"A resource for ""the rest of us"".","I was fairly surprised by the ""Big Price, No Substance"" review, I feel quite the opposite. The publisher of these booklets is interested in helping me succeed. They show it by offering customer support and the CD-ROM full of resources. This book is not meant for the Internet Professional, but is certainly meant as a guide for the rest of us to bring clarity to what the Internet is and what it can do for us. Phil"
1,"Big Price, No Substance","I've just received a lesson in marketing. The 3 pamphlets I just received for 50 bucks are full of information so basic and generic it could well have come as a government info-mailer from Pueblo, Colorado. There may be more substance in the reviews of these pamphlets as the publication itself. Run, run like the wind. Avoid this ""publication"". I'm left wondering if Amazon has any way of ensuring the legitimacy of the reviews posted here. Mike"
5,DENNIS LEE'S TRUE STORY,Wake up America! Read Dennis' true story. It will make you realize thatmaybe we aren't quite as free as we think we are.
1,very unhappy,The esc was broke.not worth paying s/h to return it.cheap quality.fell apart when I took it off the plane.bought a different 1 from someone else.
2,Already ripped!,"I like the look, size, and light weight of this bag. After using it for about 1 month the lining that separates the front pocket from the large center compartment has already torn. Also, the side pockets are too small to hold a water bottle or a baby bottle...both of which are bag necessities for me. I am still using the bag, but as soon as I find a better replacement I'll be switching."
1,"not enough info about the product, can't use it.","In a nutshell, the software works only on OLD computers. The dongle, required to use the software, does not work on new computers. So, I'm stuck with a 100 dollar software that is pretty much useless. The seller says it is amazons fault and of course amazon will blame the seller. I will have to think long and hard about using amazon again."
3,Swanson Sharp Carpenter Pencil,"Okay pencil - it tends to slide and slip while drawing a line. I do like the concept for how they put this together. However, a bit more improvement for the stability of the lead should be reviewed. It does keep a sharp edge and it does come with refills. Recommend not ordering the refill because it will take a while to use what was shipped. Hope this helps."
5,great for table and mill work - not so much for construction,"I use these for layout and finer cut work not as a substitute for carpenter's pencils. The lead in these is too fine and too hard for my needs. However, for mark-up on a table saw, band saw, drill press, etc. they work fine. I've tried every type of pencil i could find, and for me the best general purpose pencil for construction is the standard flat carpenter pencil with relatively soft and dark lead.The Swanson system is clever: there are little pencil leads embedded in plastic in the handle. When a new lead is needed, one pulls the old one from the front of the pencil and pushes it into the back, thereby moving the next new lead down one position. I have several of these, and the caps have all wandered off (no big deal in my opinion) but note that the cap will not attach to the back of the pencil as with the Bic pen design. However, I lost the caps early on and don't miss them."
3,Ok for a beginner,"This is an ok brush set for a beginner.The brushes are well packaged in the brush roll and do look nice.However, the set I received looked different to the picture, the brushes (especially the blush brush) shed a lot of hair and I found that after I washed the brushed and conditioned them, their shape changed."
4,Good general overview of the Sixties,"Even though this book is marketed to young readers (ages 9 to 12 according to Amazon), I found it to be a good general overview of the 1960s for adults too. It is not written in an overly simplistic style, and covers the usual topics of that era in quite an objective manner. For example, I was pleased that the book treats hippies in a sympathetic and balanced way, which many writers and documentaries do not. As the title suggests, it does emphasize events in the United States, yet does not totally ignore other countries. Also, it contains many appropriate black-and-white photos from the era, so it's enjoyable to browse through just for the photos. I was impressed enough with this book that I'm going to collect more of this series for myself, and I'm in my forties."
4,DEEP CRYSTAL POLISH,"This products makes a grueling job, polishing and waxing a car, a little be easier to endure and do and it also looks like this product will last much longer than most competitive products so you don't have to polish and wax as often."
2,Know what you're getting into and it's awesome,"This is the long awaited (by some at least) movie about Mike Jones and how he got his start in the rap game. We knew going in that it wouldn't be Oscar worthy, but we were hoping for at least some unintentional comedy. It was disappointing to say the least, hard to get through and really almost unwatchable."
2,"Improbable, somewhat entertaining, no spoilers below....","I've read a lot of horror, vamp lit, ghost stories etc. I guess for me this was not very frightening and the ""monsters"" were so improbable and almost ridiculous it just took most of the horror out of it. NOW on the other hand- the writing was pretty good, a few characteristics of the story were unique and entertaining. It actually kept me up late reading and was hard to put down. Regardless of the ridiculous premise-I just HAD to keep reading to see what would happen next, hence the 2 stars."
5,Julie H.,The refill sheets are great and I use them many times to add extra pages in the large photo albums.
5,Refill pages,"I like the refill pages for this photobook. However, it really doesn't pay to buy the refills. Just get another book. This particular book holds up to 500 photos. I thought I would save money by getting the refills. I bought two refills which is just about the same price for a photo book, when you also have to pay for shipping.So I probably would not buy another refill because it doesn't pay."
4,Highly Entertaining Anime,"Fun if not slightly bizarre Anime is great! The story of the Sorcerer Dark Schroder resureced through the kiss of a virgin, the characters are wonderfully protraited... even though the women are standard Japanime characters. I highly recommend this one! ya!"
2,"I didn't like it, and I'll tell ya why","On the back of the box this movie seems very good, the animation isn't that bad, and the story seems pretty good-if a bit mediocre. So I bought it, and was disappointed. The movie has the beginnings of a good story but it's not terribly original-monkeys could write it. Plus, the characters do not come across as being terribly serious, this isn't bad if the movie is a comedy, which this isn't. Overall I'd say that this movie is just another tape on the pile of fantasy style anime movies that don't really have much to them."
4,A great place to find art,"Like I said, its a great book but not the best art book ever. I would recommend it to any art, sci-fi, and fanatasy fans. Love the picture of Lara Croft from Tombraider ;)"
3,Short and nice,"The combination of long paragraphs, dialogue and author's own thought all put together in one sentence was a bit too much. More details on the live of new inmigrants and the interactions with other Peruvian inmigrants would have been nice to read about. Overall, it was a great fun read."
5,Sensuous San Francisco love story,"This story of Mimi and Etienne, two young Peruvian immigrants who meet and fall in love in San Francisco, exudes sensuality. Camincha writes with style and a poetic sensibility. Her words carry the reader into the world of San Francisco in the 1950's. As Mimi and Etienne learn to cope with their new environment and their own passions we meet many colorful characters. Camincha turns ordinary activities -- owning a home, working, buying a car -- into magical events. I wish the book were longer."
5,great,Why cant you just click the number of stars and be done? Most of time I do not want to go into detail.
5,A remarkable collection of all the tools necessary to learn the art of Reiki,"The Reiki Touch: Complete Home Learning System by William Lee Rand is a remarkable collection of all the tools necessary to learn the art of Reiki. Inclusive of a DVD video, thirty cards, two CDs and a one-hundred page workbook, The Reiki Touch expertly features complete instructions for hand positions, scanning techniques, and other advanced uses of Reiki to detect auras and perceive past lives. A ""user friendly"" and easy-to-follow instructional resource, The Reiki Touch is a very highly recommended kit for anyone who would like to become more active and proficient in Reiki."
3,Average,This author has too much stuff. He is hard to watch. Reiki is getting SO commerical. Other authors are better
5,If you must,Reiki should not be learned from a book. But if you must have a book other than the manual given you by your Reiki Master - this one or others by William Rand are the way to go.
5,Fantastic package,"This is a great DVD/CD/Book package that takes you step-by-step through Reiki healing. Whether you want to practice Reiki of yourself or your family, or whether you need an extra tool for your own practice or teaching, this set is worth its weight in gold."
3,Typically good Timex product,"Generally this is a nice watch for everyday use and traveling. I really like the indiglo feature for use in the dark. In general the only complaint is not being able to adjust the date without circling for 24 hours howrs. some of the Timex expeditions have this feature but not this model. This is a typical Timex product, lasts for a long time, perfectly functional, and doesnt look cheap."
4,Good watch Good value,"I recieved the watch on time and well packaged. So far, the watch has worked as expected, looks as expected. I am satisfied."
3,Fake Bezel / Strap too Small,"The bezel on this watch is decorative. It does not turn. That's a big frustration. There was nothing about that in the description. What's the point then? The watch is certainly nice to look at, and is really visible in the dark with the Indiglo light. The strap is a bit too short for my solid wrists. Why can't timex get that men have big wrists?"
1,Incorrect Title,There is no alarm. The description is misleading. I bought this and had to return it when I opened the package and saw no alarm.
2,Timex Watch to replace one tha t quick qorking,"I bought this particular watch because from the pictures it was iddntical to the one i had bought locally a few years ago, but could not find. When i received it, I found the quality of the case to be not nearly as good as the one I previously had."
3,watch,"I am somewhat satisfied with this watch. The only improvement I can recommend is to make the leather band longer s that it fits more comfortably for larger than average men. Overall, it is a good buy."
1,Extremely Dissatisfied,"Have had this watch for less than a month, and it loses 5-10 minutes a day. Additionally it loses about 2 days per week on the date. I never considered that it wouldn't work and threw away the box when I got it.After being late for a couple meetings and flat out having the wrong date on one occasion, I'm pitching this and looking for a non-Timex.I've worn Timex watches since I was a boy, and since I now work outside, I go through one every couple years before they need replaced. I'll be looking for something else."
2,Does not have alarm - false advertising,"Timex Men's T46681 Expedition Easy Set Alarm Brown Leather Strap Watch is the description, BUT it does NOT have an alarm. I have had very good performance from a similar Timex, and love indiglo to tell the time in the dark. I will return this & buy another Timex with alarm and indiglo."
4,Watch,I hope I can put it to good use.If I use it it will be well worth the expenseI find it very east to use & enjoy.
2,"This was a ""good"" book","I really liked the first 2/3's of this book. I thought H/H were great together, but I just stopped reading it when it seemed to be falling flat, I'm not sure what happened it seemed that conflict between the mother and father of the heroine began to take shape, which I didn't get and the ""courting"" between the main couple seemed to come to somewhat of a stop. Like I said I loved the first 2/3's of book, but it just seemed to fall apart after that."
3,Just okay,"It wasn't bad... but you knew how it was going to end by about a third of the way into it, and then it just kind of wandered around getting to the end. I don't think I'd buy it again."
2,Hamilton Beach Brewstation Deluxe Coffee Maker just OK,"Very disappointed that this product is not as advertised. It does not have any insulated thermal characteristics on the reservoir as claimed and it definitely does have a hot plate that scorches the coffee flavor contrary to advertisement. On the plus side, it does brew good coffee and tastes great but only if you serve it fresh."
5,Hamilton Beach Coffee Maker,"Great machine, fast making coffee maker. Keeps it nice and hot with a 2 hour shut off timer. Very Fast shipping highly recommended."
1,Be careful in your search,"I read a previous review that said other vendors were selling the a lesser Brewstation model as the 47454 model. So, I made sure I searched for the exact model I wanted. I already have a Deluxe Brewstation #47454 and wanted to purchase another one for a friend. I typed the exact model #47454 into the search box on Amazon. It pulled up a Deluxe Brewstation. There was no further description, but the vendor and shipper was Amazon, so I thought I was safe... since I searched for the specific model number! I receive the lesser model anyway. After arguing about the false advertising in the search section of the Amazon.com website, wrapping up the box back up, finding the email, printing the return slip, running to the UPS station, etc... I received a full refund.... but no gift for my friend. I purchased my original Brewstation 47454 from Walmart.com."
1,doesn't last long at all,i loved this thing until the seal went at month 7. really? 7 months is all i get for $54.
5,LOVE the Brew Station!!!,This is my second Hamilton Beach Brew station coffee maker and I just LOVE them! The press and pour button makes it so easy to get a cup of coffee and the coffee really does stay fresher in this kind of system. I also love that it has the automatic shut off after a few hours so you never have to worry about leaving it on for too long by accident.Loved my last one which was an older model but still worked well; I only bought a new one because I moved across country and didn't bring my coffee maker with me.
1,"Plastic part broken, no longer dispensing coffee","Machine is a couple years old and stopped dispensing. I clean it regularly. The mechanism that pushes up on the tank to release coffee appeared to be working ok, and the part on the tank (the valve) will release coffee if I press it by hand. Unsure what the problem was, so I emailed H-B customer service, even emailed photos of the lever and the valve... they told me to buy a new tank. With tax and shipping we're talking about $22. I got the tank, installed it, no flow from the new tank either. (there goes 22 bucks I could have put toward a new coffee maker) Turns out the lever arm that pushes up from the bottom part was cracked and looked ok (did not break off completely so appeared to be working). I'm not sure I would buy another one of these model 47454's. Also was unsure I should trust their service folks - turns out to be true."
1,Hamilton Beach Deluxe Brew Station,"I received this coffee brew station on December 8, 2010...On January 13, 2011, the apparatus starting making an odd noise...upon investigation, the coffee pot keeps on boiling even after the coffee is done...evidently the heat sensing unit or thermal cut out has gone south...a shame...something this new, lasting barely a month...will not purchase another one...and I would not recommend this product to anyone...unless you want the hassle of returning the product."
5,Excellent coffeemaker,"I was shopping around for a one cup coffeemaker and I came across this AMAZING coffee maker. I can brew just a few cups for myself, or a whole pot when I have company over, and either way it tastes GREAT!!!!! I love that theres no carafe, it dispenses right into your coffee mugs, which is awesome when you have a lot of people over! It makes great tasting coffee and I absolutely love it!!!!!!!"
1,Great till the return date ran out,"Was great for a few months,then it started leaking. Went in the kitchen to get a cup of coffee and coffee was everywhere!!! Don't but this coffee maker. i have to keep a coffee cup under the spout to catch the leaking coffee."
2,BEWARE,"this machine leaks all over the place with condensation. poor design. water entry too small. have a towel ready when you get ready to clean the pot. i have to be on catch the water everyday when removing the basket. the water pours out the back of the machine. it collects under the lid. and, this is the second pot. no more from hamilton beach."
3,Hmmmm......,"I expected a bit more from this, especially given the price. It's o.k., the ""Flavor"" setting makes a decent cup of coffee, albeit after 15 minutes or so, but the burner gets very hot and tends to fry the coffee in the carafe even at the lowest setting of one hour (why can't they make an insulated carafe, that doesn't need a burner?), and the directions say you are to unplug the unit between uses. That means you have to reset the clock, etc. every time you plug it in. The delay set works fine, the fact that you're not pouring from a pot is nice. But overall, after going through seven coffee pots to find the best coffee maker, I go with Consumer Reports and say the the basket-type Black and Decker coffee maker, at about $15, is the best cup of home-made coffee I've had."
1,deception by amazon,"while searching for a hamilton beach coffee maker model 47454, and only this model, several websites list amazon as the seller of this model at a price of [...]. not a bad price but when you read further they have substituted a cheaper model with many flaws in an obvious effort to deceive you. CHECK THE MODEL NUMBER FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THE DISCONTINUED MODEL THAT HAS MANY FLAWS AND PROBLEMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not a review but a question,"Reviews on this site are excellent. On Consumer Reports, most say this pot leaks. Which is true? I like the idea of this one, but don't want a leaky pot. Also, does it steam out the top - like it might ruin my cabinets like the present Gevalia pot I have? Thanks!!!"
2,IT ALREADY BROKE!,"This coffeemaker lasted less than 6 months. I brew 4 cups everyday. The pump stopped sucking the water, and so after making a little, the coffeemaker would turn off. Then I'd have to turn it on again, and again! Up to 6 times to make what I needed. I think any appliance should last at least a year. Luckily, I was able to return it to the wholesaler I purchased it from, but otherwise, it would have been trash. Buyer BEWARE!I'm going to try a different brand.To be fair, the coffee it made was great while it lasted, that's why I gave 2 stars instead of zero."
1,"poor redesign,the older models are much better","buy one if you like cleaning,this model is messy.Their coffee grinder won't hold enough coffee to make a full pot either."
3,"Great, but LEAKY!","Loved the coffee maker, but it leaked all over the place. Tried everything to fix it, because I really liked it, but it kept leaking."
1,not so good coffee,After doing alot of research on coffee pots we decided to try out this one. We have always had a thermal carafe. Krups was our last one but by the time I got my coffee it was cool. This coffee maker does not make good coffee. It is really hot but has a burnt taste. We also had problems with the program not working. We sent it back and got a Capresso thermal pot. Love it.
3,Great except the eventual leakage,"I have bought 3 of these. I love that it has no carafe! Only problem is that they have all eventually leaked. I think there should be a recall on the mechanism that releases the coffee into your cup, but until that happens, as much as I have loved this coffee maker, I will not buy another one!!!!"
1,Beware it Breaks,"This is our third machine and it's the last Hamilton Beach product we'll ever buy. The dispenser always breaks, each and every time. They don't have parts even though it's an easy fix. For this price I want better quality.This last time they offered to replace the coffee maker for a 49.95 restocking fee plus we have to pay to ship the electrical cord back after we follow their cut-it-up instructions. Seriously, a 49.95 restocking fee. Someone must carry it around the warehouse on a velvet pillow. They've lost a customer for good this time."
2,pink tools,"The tools are good, but the box they are in is very cheap and won't stay closed!! So don't think you can even use the box....go ahead and buy a different set."
1,Should come with a warning - keep away from impressionable young boys,"At first I was very happy with these lovely tools my most feminine projects. They are excellent for fixing the washing machine, tinkering with the sewing machine, unclogging the vacuum cleaner, etc. However, I have two sons and the younger one loves to play handyman. He got a hold of these last week and instead of pretending to build cars, rocket ships, and laser-guns, he has started building cradles, shoe racks and rainbows, RAINBOWS!The packaging should definitely come with a warning, something like ""Caution, feminizing product! For women and girls only."""
4,A different view of Hendrix,"A well written book, with more emphasis on Jimi's family life.If you want to know more about his glory days and his music this is not the book for you.A great addition to a Jimi book collection."
5,Hendrix History,"I had heard of Jimi Hendrix here and there and had seen him on shirts,but was completely uninformed about the musical icon. If you're like me and know nothing or close to nothing about Hendrix then this book will be very beneficial. Through the reading of this I was able to gain insight on his personal life, his life before the fame, various musical accomplishments, and his character traits. The small section of pictures in between also helps the reader better envision what some of his friends and family members look like. Anyway, if you're looking to expand your knowledge on African- American musicians then this book should definetly be of consideration."
4,Im no student of Hendrix but I liked it enough,"Hendrix is so idolized and mythologized these days, mostly by pretentious boomers like the ones writing over at crappy mags like Rolling Stone. Im a younggun, and started listening to Hendrix 6 or 7 years ago and loved it so; but to be honest I didnt know much of his life, but I guess I didnt care much either. Hendrix's music exists in like this capsule away from his actual physical person and self, writers have no problem calling him ""the greatest guitarist ever"" or praising his songwriting but dont ever bother with him.So, maybe thats why I liked this book. It gave some weight and depth to the person behind the great music but also showed him to be a mortal who fell to his base pleasures. It's a well-balanced, smooth read, and I recommend it."
5,A Masterpiece,"To capture the life of a god is a feat not many could successfully tackle, but Cross does it gracefully and brilliantly. Infusing his narrative with first hand accounts of stories that span the entire emotional spectrum from inspiring to hilarious to heartbreaking, Cross offers his audience a chance to understand the man behind the music that changed the world. Completely readable and fantastic, this is not only the best biography I have ever read, but possibly the best book."
1,Enough Biographies,"I have been listening and playing his music for over thirty years. These biographies add nothing to learning about the man. Listen to the music. If you wnat to read something that reflects a different side of him, read Monika Dannemans book. This is a person who loved him for the person he was, not necessarily the god of rock guitar. Her observations are subjective but revealing nontheless. As great as he was, these countless biographies are excessive, unless you want to learn about the countless hangers on."
2,No that good!!,"I've never been a big fan of Charles R. Cross, and I'm sorry to say my opinion hasn't changed even after reading this book. Yeah sure, there're plenty of details about Jimi's early life, and the book does include interviews with several of Hendrix's close family members and friends. But I am definitely more fascinated with Jimi's music, and not the minute details of his life. Yeah, his background and his history helps us understand him and his music a little better. But I'm sure there are several other interesting facets of Jimi than what're mentioned here. Just like his biography of Kurt(which I loathe), Cross' writing feels like a novel, like a fictional story even if it's all true and real. I haven't read very many books about Jimi but I'm sure there're some out there better than this one. At least, I hope there are."
4,a good read for any hendrix fan,"I really liked how entertaining of a read this book was. Cross' connections and understanding of the Seattle area give the book a unique perspective to Hendrix's roots. You feel like he became like a part of the Hendrix family and you the reader were allowed a glimpse into Jimi's family as told by somebody inside the circle. However, after Jimi leaves New York for England, the story is told much too hastily and is murky. I'm reading Electric Gyspy right now and it is much more detailed in the facts though not as fun. Room Full of Mirrors on the other hand transcends the Hendrix myth and historical trivia and boldly and artfully paints an intimate portrait of the origins of a musical genius."
3,Interesting,I've only gotten past the first couple chapters and it's interesting thus far. I look forward to how it continues and develops.
1,Room Full of Mirrors : A Biography of Jimi Hendrix,"Horrible. It's the only word that can describe this book. It's clear the author interviewed a significant number of people researching this book, but who cares if there is NOTHING compelling to read after the interviews are done. No really, this is the worst book I have ever read. I love Jimi's music, which brought me to the book, but this book does nothing but chronicle his life via patched together anectdotes. There's no insight, no summarized thoughts - just a BORING listing of trivial events. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Just keep listening to his music!!"
3,"Worthy effort, but misses a lot","Cross makes two important contributions: 1) As others have noted, there's a lot of new information about Jimi's early life and the first 100 pages or so give a a very moving picture of his childhood. 2) The book makes clear how important Jimi's Seattle background was to his multicultural outlook, which is what made him willing and able to cross established boundaries more easily than if he had been born in raised in say the South or Northeast.The rest of the book is fairly perfunctory stuff and Jimi's music is pretty much absent. Cross presents music as something Hendrix only thought about when he tired of cavorting with groupies and assorted low-lifes.I'm also docking the book a star for not having an adequate bibliograpy."
3,'Mirrors' lacks clear reflection,"Having recently been given a compilation of obscure Hendrix by a friend and not being a huge Hendrix fan I wanted some background. Cross' 'Room Full of Mirrors' provides a lot of detail about Jimi's life without explaining much. As a chronology I'll assume it is accurate. There just isn't any 'heart and soul' to the read. Jimi's early years are described with a dry, factual detachment. But how did he make the leap from a dreamer to a participant? How did this high school drop out become the greatest electric guitar player of all time? You'll have to 'just ask the axis', because it's not here."
5,Good read!,"If you have any interest in Jimi Hendrix's life and what the guy was all about...this is definitely a good source and a good book to get his account of his life and lifestyle. Very sad he died the way he did being a true artist as he was, though he had a pretty crazy lifestyle before and after he became famous. What a fantastic guitar player he was. Really too bad he never got to record with Miles Davis as they had planned. That would have been awesome!"
3,Great in the early years,"If you're like me and have read two or three other Hendrix biographies and a ton of articles as well, there's not a whole lot new in this book. However, Cross does an excellent job with the pre-famous Hendrix years. Jimi's complex relationship with his family is also explained nicely."
2,And now for something completely 'orrible,"Well, maybe not completely, but watching Eric Idle and four non-Pythons sing for the better part of 91 minutes wasn't what I expected. They made a big deal that this is ""From the Creators of Spamalot"" but it was nothing like Spamalot, let alone classic Python. Probably a 5% to 95% dialog to singing ratio with a disjointed storyline based on Life of Brian where the five main stars never made any costume changes and there were no sets. They didn't even perform the Life of Brian movie theme song. Michael Palin definitely stole what little show there was. Terry Gilliam had a funny bit. Terry Jones pretty much just sang a song. No wonder John Cleese decided to give this one a miss. As a diehard Python fan, I had no choice but to do my duty and fork over my hard-earned cash, but in all honesty, this is bloody spam this is."
2,What did he say ? What are they talking about ?,"Fine music , but it requires having seen the characters and their routines in the series to fully enjoy the show . The sly English humor is hard to fathom out of context . I'm sorry that I just wasn't there that often and didn't see that much . Should be a real kick for a fan ."
1,Turns out...,I'm not too interested in watching a Life of Brian opera. But I'd love to see the Spamalot musical!
1,Ugh.,Ugh. This is like opera or something and nothing like Monty Python. I got 15 minutes in and then I had to quit.
4,Must have for Pythons,"I didn't know what I was getting, but after an NPR interview with Eric Idle I bought this, thinking it was a stage production. It was, but of a concert, not a play. This was a little disappointing at first, but we quickly got into the ""opera"" and absolutely loved it. There were slow spots, but overall a great production. I wouldn't recommend it for younger audiences because I think they would be bored, but other than that it was totally suitable. The Royal Albert Hall gave the production a wonderful, exotic air, and you felt like you were part of the audience. The British audience was perfectly behaved,so the recording was excellent. If you love the Monty Python gang you need this in your collection."
5,"Wonderful romp with excellent, fun music.","I never care much for Monty Python when the group was popular on TV. But now coming Not the Messiah and I'm ready to take a second look at other Monty Python material. The music, the performers and the really funny send up on ""The Messiah"" combine to make this a show I'm happy to watch again and again.The video production is outstanding and Eric Idle does a super job anchoring this ""oratorio"".I rented this first on Blu-ray and knew it would be a worthy purchase. It is."
4,Fun and entertaining...and steamy!,"From the first time Griffen sees Brandy and overhears her conversation with her boss, he gets the wrong impression about her. This colors the way he thinks about her and he continues to misinterpret what he sees and hears. Instead of setting him straight, Brandy decides to play along. Things get awkward when she ends up working for him. Funny, with plenty of tension and lots of steam.I was provided an audio copy for review and I enjoyed it. The narrator, Sheila Book, did a nice job. The story was easy to listen to and she differentiated between the characters nicely. She did muddle through the brief conversation that called for a British accent. Overall it was a steamy, enjoyable listen."
5,Designing Woman was a Winner,"I've read all of Elaine Raco Chase's books and this is my absolute favorite. I loved the strong, smart, intellectual characters and the plot was well developed. Whenever I laugh right out loud - it's a keeper. And I laughed a lot. Even on the second & third reading it was still fun. A must read."
2,Cushion Installation not intuitive,"Instructions for cushion installation are very poor. They consist of a series of pictures which are too small to read. In addition, they are printed on a reflective surface which makes things even worse. The manufacturer's website is also not helpful, so you basically have to figure out how to do it yourself. The key is you need to realize that the oval white strap adjuster (which goes behind your baby's back) has tabs with a gap in them. You can slide the straps out through that gap. Then you can install the cushion, run the straps through the cushion slots, and finally reattach the adjuster.Other than this, we like it! Once you get it installed it looks good."
1,Useless,"This is probably the worst-designed cushion system I have encountered. It had totally unintelligible diagramatic instrustuctions, useless even with a magnifying glass. The only way one can effectively use this system requres that the seat-belts be completely dissasembled each time one wishes to clean the pad, or to permanently remove the shoulder harness clip (which should have been designed to be manually unclipped). Last Stokke product I buy."
2,It did not fit,"Unfortunately, the cushion did not fit the tripp trapp highchair. We tried to put it in every possible way, and we found that the chushion is not exactly the same as in the drawings and instructions in the manual. So, we could only use the seat part. Nevetheless, the seat cushion looks great."
3,"Mug is perfect, but single unit (not set of 3 as in product description)","The mug itself is amazingly beautiful.. well made, very solid and nice looking. It will be a perfect gift for your doc.However I was expecting a set of 3 as in product description.. but received single mug.Product deserves 5 star rating, but as a whole for getting 1/3 of the set I give 3 star!"
4,"8"" straight spatula","I was looking for an heir to my 80 year old butter knife. This is a good choice. Unfortunately, it doesn't have a full-tang blade, but what's to be expected for 3.00?My main use for this will be as a butter/peanut butter/jelly knife. The eight inch length will get to the bottom of most jars.Personally, I would prefer a longer blade for cake-decorating. I don't like any part of my hand or spatula handle going over the cake.Delivery was stated to be by the end of August. I didn't get it until mid-September. I didn't get any email from the seller telling me there would be a delay.P.S....I just clicked on the item to verify some information and I see the price went up to 5.00"
3,Bands break,"I like the face and size of this watch so much that I have owned three of them. However, I won't buy another because: two were lost when the bands broke away from the watch face, and, the third got moisture in it from wearing it in the shower. I guess I need a tougher watch!"
1,Is this a men's watch or a ladies watch?,"I ordered this from Amazon, and I got a Ladies watch. I called Amazon, they sent a replacement and again... i was sent a Ladies watch.The invoice and packing slip say Men's ... but the Timex box says ""Lds""If you're looking to purchase this as a men's watch.. be warned. I don't think the title/description is correct."
2,Good enough,"I bought this case for the sole purpose of the armband, and it works for that. It's easy enough to get in and out. What I don't like about it is:1) Way over priced2) It leaves sticky glue on the iPod3) It leaves marks where the plastic ends on the inside4) Very bulky5) It doesn't line up perfectly like the picture would have you believeIt hasn't made any scratches on mine but I haven't put it in and taken it out enough. I would not suggest using this case for everyday use, it's fine for working out but that's as far as it goes in my opinion."
1,Scratches iPod,"I bought this case thinking it would protect my iPod from dings and scratches as the box said, but little did I know that it would not only disprove its own claim, but cause scratching all together! After putting my iPod in the DLO Action Jacket for 5G iPod with its included arm band and running for about 15 minutes, the iPod had several scratches. I inspected the inside of the case to see if there was any debris that could be causing this. In fact, it was actually the stitching used to hold the screen and clickwheel protectors in place, which is made out of a plastic-like material. I would not reccomend this product whatsoever."
4,Good Case if You Take Precautions...,"I've tried several different cases on my 30gb Video iPod, from the hardshell to the folio to the sleeves and this DLO was the best of the lot. You MUST leave the protective film on the front of the iPod, however, or buy yourself some replacements. Since I have to take the iPod out of the case to dock it with my Bose due to the rubber flange around the bottom, I think I caused some of the minor scratching. The neoprene has kind of a suedy feel to it that does not attract lint and dirt nearly as bad as the silicone cases and it has just enough padding not to be bulky. I've had this case for 3 years and I'm well pleased with it."
4,Its Good - ease of taking iPod in and Out of the case,"I like this case because its easy to take the iPod in and out- I use a docking station and fm Transmitter in my car so I need the ipod to be used free of the case. I tried the iSkin case but it encloses the iPod completely and does not allow it to be used with docks and fm transmitters. I also tried the 'Vaja' leather case from Covercase but it has no belt clip!The DLO case has the right padding so the ipod gets the protection it needs from bumps and falls without the adding too much bulk (like the ToughSkin). The belt clip is perfect, comes off with ease and also lets the ipod rotate.If you can put a protective film(+ $3) on the front and back, it wont scratch your ipod."
3,DLO case ok so far....,"Got this from Best Buy for about same money. Seems okay so far, but I haven't taken it to the gym yet either. Haven't tried to dock ipod with case on, although it doesn't look like it'll work unless it's off. I can connect USB just fine, unlike some others said. It's a little snug, but cable fits it just fine. Don't know about scratching, as someone mentioned. I'll update after it's made a few trips to the gym. 3 stars until then...."
2,There are better cases out there...,"This is an ok product. I'll break it down into pros & cons:PROS: It covers nearly everything on the iPod.CONS: The stitching on the interior scratches the iPod. It's also very hard to connect anything to it while it's in the case, so you have to take it out to connect it to anything. The belt clip is bulky, and the arm strap is cumbersome.Basically, this is a good case, if you plan on just leaving the iPod in there. Otherwise, I would go with one of those cool silicon cases.In the end, I ended up taking this case back."
4,Good with caution...,I bought this after reading all of the reviews about this scratching your Ipod.I went and bought an Invisible Shield before using this product so I cannot confirm the scratching theory...though I believe all of these reviewers.Since I already have the protection I had bought this for the purpose of usability. For me the design is perfect. I also prefer the removable clip cause it is exactly what I needed.The only con for me...since I don't have the scratching problem...is the fact that the shield over the dial can occasionally be a little non-sensative and needs extra pressure for me to actually control the dial...and at other times it is ultra sensitive and when you want to nudge up the volume it actually jumps because the shield is not as tight to the dial. I think I would actually just rather not have the film there.
5,It works,"I found the book easy to read and understand. I stopped snacking and had no cravings. My energy levels were stable, I've never felt better. It's the first time I've lost weight without feeling deprived. I Totally recommend this book."
4,A beneficial read,"I'm not entirely new to Ayurveda which made certain parts of this book confusing, yet other parts were very beneficial. The author puts his own spin on Ayurvedic principles which made things a little confusing as I have been reading more traditional versions previous to this book. His explanations as to why to eat certain foods at certain times is very helpful in understanding the natural cycles of nature and the body."
5,Another good kit at a good price...,"As lousy as some of Revell's airplane products are, they never cease to amaze me at how quickly they put out quality car models at such low prices. This kit is fun, accurate, and goes together well. I would've made a few small changes to how the pieces come apart, but now complains overall. Keep 'em coming!"
3,Kinda Bland Tasting,Not a bad taste.Nothing special.Bland tasting.Made in my bread machineWon't buy anymore due to lack of taste.
5,Perfect bread mix,"I bake bread for friends and family during the Holiday Season as gifts. This HM White mix consistanly gives me great results. It has a nice rise, texture, and flavor. It is my go-to mix for great bread. You won't be disappointed."
4,Works easily in a bread machine. No complaints at all,"The box contains everything you need to make bread, other than water and butter. I am precise about the volume of the ingredients and I get a consistent loaf from the bread machine each time. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars when there is nothing wrong with it is that I grew up in Australia, where the bread tasted even nicer than this. The home-made taste is nice, and better than most breads bought at a store, and the smell of fresh bread is wonderful, but to my tastes, it's not perfect.I'm sure you'll enjoy this product."
4,Whole Grain,"These boxed breads are great to keep on hand. Nutritious and tasty, you can whip them up in a relatively short time, and there's nothing quite like fresh-baked bread."
3,Lacking in Taste,"This was ok, but not as tasty as other bread mixes I've used in the past. I'll try the honey wheat next."
3,"Taste great, but won't rise...","I got the wholesome white bread mix, and I like the taste of it. The only problem I have is I can't get it to rise in my bread machine. I turns out great but it is a mini loaf. I tried mixing it is the machine, and mixing it by hand and cooking it in my machine and I get the same results. I have not tried making it in the oven which is another option."
3,Poor factory packaging,"While it makes good bread, I've been very disappointed with it due to every single box that I've opened to date (4 boxes so far) having its plastic packaging inside not sealed along the vertical seam. Apparently the adhesive used to seal the plastic bag containing the mix didn't hold, or if heat was used to seal the seam, that technique didn't work either."
5,Good staple mix,"I order these by the case every month. I use my bread machine a few times a week, mostly from scratch but when time is tight we use this mix. My kids love it!"
4,YUM,"YUM YUM Excellent flavor and texture when baked to a medium crust. Less butter is better, none was best of all."
4,Love it!,Love the fountain. It's just what I needed for the front patio. The only drawback is the solar panel does not charge-up. The panel needs to have direct light for the fountain to work. So this means no trickling water at night for me...don't have a power source at that particular area.
4,Top of the Trip Hops,"Possibly one of the most underrated Trip Hop albums, coming out around the release of Sneeker Pimps and Morcheeba's debut albums this one was truly overlooked, combining aspects of both the fore mentioned albums(and then some), Londinium takes you through a soundscape exploration of a rather eclectic kind, theres quite a few well crafted instrumentals all reasonably chilled, but with more experimentalism than your average Trip Hop album,however the quality never suffers. Having both a female and a male singer sets them apart from the usual Trip Hop formula, the cool flowing raps add an extra dimension and edge to the whole ablum, an absolute must for Trip Hop and Electronia fans.Well above average."
2,"Could have been great, but was ruined","What could have been a great Trip-Hop album was completely ruined by the terrible rapping. The music is incredibly textured and the female vocal is amazing, but the mc's rap style harkens back to the early styles of the 1980's, and he uses the same cadence on every track. I'd love to get my hands on the origional recordings and completely lift his vocal from the record. This album is not worth getting."
5,I'm an Archive junkie!,"This is definitely the best album of ""trip-hop"" ever made(with ""dummy"").Listen to it one time and you will never listen to anything else!Truly an 'LP'of god..."
4,"top notch trip hop, awful rap",pro: trip hop grooves rate up there with the best of them. beautiful eerie female vocals. reminiscent of zero7.con: several tracks ruined by the horrible rap style and delivery. this album would be 6 times better without the bad rap (npi).
1,didn't work with my seat,kept falling off my seat (orbit). also my 4mo old didn't deem interested in it at all. He loves his whozit spiral!
3,Clib too small,"My baby seemed to like this toy and I think it would have been really entertaining for her, but the clib that attaches this arch to the car seat and/or stroller is not flexible enough, it does not widen up enought and ended up being too small. I could not use it for my car seat or stroller, so I had to return it."
2,"""Less than expected""",Bar is hard to connect to stroller. I ended up disconnecting the toys and getting rid of the bar.
3,Falls off my stroller (Bob Revolution),"Great musical toy. Unfortunately, the clips are not designed to hold on to my stroller, and the arch falls off. Also, the clips are way too hard to open."
1,Not what I expected,"I bought the Tiny Love Musical arch for my 3 months old daughter...I was expecting alot more with this products but was very disappointed with it.First of all you have to hit it really hard to get a tune to play and it does not stay on the car set or her chair the claws keep slipping off I plan to take of the toys and let her play with them..I would not recommend it to any one, a waste of money."
2,Doesn't fit onto my Graco Safe Seat,"I bought this because my son, at 5 months, decided the car seat had become a torture device and cried from the moment he was strapped in. We were hoping this would distract him, but we could never get it to clip properly onto the car seat. It would usually fall off en route to wherever we were going and it didn't do much to distract him. In the end we discovered a lullaby version of Radiohead's ""No Surprises"" which was magical."
2,cheap toy,"The arch was cheaply made, it didn't stay on the car seat or the stroller secure. Then the arch bent. I had to return it."
1,I hate this toy,It doesnt stay on the carseat AND the turtle makes noise constantly any time i go on a bump - i cant shut it off. I want to throw it out the window.
1,Does NOT stay on,"This toy does not stay on. I bought it mainly for the car seat but it won't stay attached on our Chicco car seat or the Bugaboo stroller. As soon as I think I've attached it well enough for it to stay on at least for a short time, my baby touches one of the hanging toys and the whole thing falls down on the baby. It's also supposed to play 3 tunes but 99% of the time it plays the same tune over and over no matter how many times you press on the hippo. The only time I've heard the other 2 tunes is when the car seat is being moved and the toy plays music without being touched (mind you that it's still not attached to the car seat and u just leave it on top of the seat while the baby is not in it). Wish I could return it but I no longer have the box."
4,He's my new best friend!,I don't see how he can write books with no hands...and bunny ears stapled to his head.
1,uncomfortable,The book makes sence. I read the Neale Walsh books also and I just feel that the Jeffrey character took things into his own hands that he should not have. The book seems to promote that and I find that disturbing. I feel that the author has good potential however maybe he should reconsider his methods.
4,Do not buy this here,These little toys run about $4 at Target to $5 at Toys R Us and Justice. This example of capitalism is nothing more than a rip off of kids trying to find a little toy. Soooooo sad!
1,My Goodness,Please dont rip people off...you can get these things at walmart and dollar gen ETC...for $5.00 or $6.00 ...greed is not a cool thing
2,So-so bakeware,"I was quite disappointed in the performance of this pan. I lightly sprayed it with nonstick cooking spray but my low-fat muffins still stuck like crazy to the pan -- I was expecting the pan to be nonstick since it is silicone. Also, the muffins baked very unevenly in the pan, something that I have not experienced with metal bakeware. Maybe a lower baking temperature is necessary. In any case, this is both my first and last purchase of silicone bakeware."
5,Amazing books!,I have just started painting and love the Impressionists but did not have any books explaining the era and the painters. My best friend is an award winning artist and she recommended these books as they were spoken about in her artists group. The two book set is beautifully done and chocked full of information and paintings. A true delight!
4,Impressionism Book Review,"In most ways this is a great set of books at a great price! Excellent text by a worthwhile and authoritative author. Plates are good quality - good detail, good color. Unfortunately the plates seem to be scattered randomly throughout the books, and it takes a lot of effort and page flipping to find the plate being referenced by the text."
2,WAY TOO SMALL TO READ,"Don't waste your money on this book, the size is way too small to read or appreciate the paintings. I should return it."
2,"SEVERAL FATAL FLAWS, ACTUALLY!","The instructor knows his stuff, but after about 4 minutes I realized that I was being irritated by his ""California UpSpeak"". You know - where he puts no periods at the ends of sentences, but talks every phrase as a question!!!??? I actually feel like I wasted twenty bucks, cuz I just can't get thru this DVD, and worse, I can never refer to it. Gotta look elsewhere for crisp, clean, lucid GarageBand instruction.By the way, reviewer ""MLaseen's"" comments are right on the money!"
5,Delightful,"This is a delightful collection of French traditional music and modern compositions base on that tradition. When I first played it for an academic musicologist friend she went nuts because she heard it as troubadour music and she had no idea that there is a living tradition of those songs. An earlier album of theirs, Musiques Traditionnelles du Limousin, is more of an ethnomusicological collection of traditional songs and tunes that they collected from the ""old-timers"" of the region. (My French isn't nearly good enough to tell what they're saying about the songs.) One of the band members told me that they consider Acrobates et Musiciens to be more their own work, their own music rather than purely traditional.In short, this is a wonderful group of ancient and modern acoustical compositions. Highly recommended."
1,Made in China,"I bought this item to replace a 25 year old cooker thats showing it's age. I was NOT pleased with the diference in quality between the old (made in USA) and new (made in China) models. The old cooker is 1/8 in. aluminum, the new is 1/16 in. The old lid is solid molded glass, the new looks like plexiglass with a plastic knob screwed on. The old base is hefty bakelite, the new seems to be some cheap and flimsy molded plastic. And the new cooking pot doesn't sit flat on the base.West Bend has lost me as a customer for life. If I can't find a good quality kitchen appliance any more, I'll go back to cast iron on the stovetop."
4,Too hot to touch,"My wifes slow cooking has dramatically improved with this cooker. I do not understand why the food is moist and tender. When it was always dry and tough when she used her old crock pot. I know that the cooker is the only thing which has changed. I cannot give 5 stars because the cooker has no off position on the switch. The other night we found the pot still hot 3 hours after I thought I had turned it off. In reality I had just turned it to the lowest possible setting. With an empty pot, this is still too hot to touch. The only way to turn it off is to unplug."
5,"don't buy a rival type-low, med., high setting cooker","Having used and worn out a West Bend slow cooker that I received 30 years ago, I shopped locally for a new one, and, being unable to find one, bought a Rival 3 heat setting crock. Is is a crock, as you cannot slow cook at normal low heat levels, it cooks to hot and fast. Finally, located the cooker I want here, with the variable heat setting, and I'm back in business. Local stores are loaded with worthless cookers. If you really want to ""slow cook"", buy one of these West Bend cookers, there is nothing else like it that I've been able to find."
5,W B Slow Cooker,This is such an improvement over my old ceramic crock pot. I love the non-stick surface. The shape makes it easy to use. I use this several times a week.
3,West Bend oblong Slow Cooker Review,"I really like this product because of the size and shape. It is great if you have a small countertop. We use it in our RV. The nonstick surface is great also/easy cleanup. The only downside is the base that doubles as a little grill. It really does not heat up as well as I thought it would itself. I tried to make pancakes on it and it never really got hot enough to cook them right. The base however does heat up enough when using the top slow cooker on it. Very strange. Overall I do really like it as a slow cooker, but not as a separate griddle."
5,a great slow cooker,we had used one for twenty years and needed a new one for our motor home and we like it very much
3,west bend slow cooker,"I am still trying to figure out the right temperaturesto properly cook roasts. Even when I cook it on the lowest settingof 3 my meat comes out to dry.Crock-pots seem to cook roasts perfectlywhere as the West Bend slow cooker dries the meat out.Easy to clean, perfect size and light weight.I would give it a 5 if I can figure out how not todry out my meat."
5,West Bend oblong slow cooker,"Have used a 6 qt version of this cooker for about 25 years. It has been hard to locate in retail for several years but found one last Fall, a 5 qt. unit. The variable temperature feature is a must have as opposed to the low,med,hi settings on most of the other available cookers on the market. A beef roast will brown nicely in this unit, unlike a crockpot type cooker. My 6 qt. is still going strong, but the no-stick coating is long gone. For those folk who are opposed to a teflon coated unit, there are several 8 qt. roasters, surround heat, variable temp, with an enamel interior on the market. I use one for BIG batches, like cooking down a turkey carcass or roasting a ham. I am sure that the stand-alone units save energy over using the stove oven."
5,West Bend Oblong Slow Cooker,This cooker is great. Buy it and you will be very happy you did. We bought one for our daughter too! Ours replaces a West Bend Oblong cooker we had used for years.
5,FINALLY!!!!!!!,"I have been hunting for this particular slow cooker, for months.. I was in every store in the area... Finally I got brave, and looked for it on the net.. and there it was!!! so I ordered it, and it was here in no time at all... I can't tell you how pleased I am.. Needless to say, I am a little old lady that is not to good with the computer.. so it took allot for me to do it.. but now that I am and ""old"" pro... I will not be shy the next time... Joan"
5,Love this product,"I previously owned a slow cooker like this one but after 15 years thenon stick finish was gone and food would stick to the bottom, so I decidedit was time to replace it. I brought a different kind the second time around, one with a removable stone crock because none of our local storeshad one like my first one. That was a big mistake. I didn't like anything about the new one, that is when I decided to shop online and see if I could find one like my first one. I did and I couldn't be happier with it. The features that I love about it are the 1-5 heat settings, the non stick finish that is so easy to clean and the fact that you can use it on your stovetop. I would highly recommend this product. If you are shopping for a slow cooker and your not sure what to buy, I assure you that you won't be disappointed, it is well worth the money."
1,what a time saving machine,"I had a very similar machine for many years. It was also a West Bend. It works very well. The only thing that I regret is that I did not buy the 6 quart. I would recommend this product to anyone. I loved it years ago, and I love the new one also. Put it in the cooker,set it and it is ready when you are. Thank you West Bend."
2,card error,"Worked fine for a well then got card error and refused to work. Viking honored its warranty and exchanged it (ergo, the 2 stars), but the same thing happened to the second card."
1,"So far, not good",I write this with limited information but I am concerned about this product. Have a new Canon S400 with 128 Viking CF card. Tried to download pictures to computer and got an error on pic 12 (of 24). Was able to skip this one and download others - one at a time. This could be a drag if you have many shots. Perhaps there is another explanation and it is not the fault of the CF card but other comsumer comments give me pause.
5,A Must Read,"In Today's society, there is a prevalent practice of quelling the practices of the homosexual lifestyle. In his book, The Enemy Within, Tom Ward uncovers the realities of the homosexual lifestyle as well as the myths that accompany it. In his unbiased and practical approach, Ward gives advice on how to deal with false teachings of gay churches to solid, Christian advice on handling relationships with people who are living the gay lifestyle. His avowal of God's love for everyone is the premise on which this book is based. It is a great help for all who seek understanding about homosexuality and God's word. I especially like the way he enlightens the reader by using biblical facts to dispell false teachings. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an unquenchable thirst for knowledge about this lifestyle."
5,THE ENEMY WITHIN- 7 ******* STARS,"The Enemy WithinBy Tom WardIsbn# 1413737455Tom Ward's "" The Enemy Within"" is a must read for everyone wether you are homosexual or heterosexual. Many poeple will disagree with his thoughts and writings. I found his book veryinformative and to the point. I do agree that children at a young age wether it's a boy or a girl , that parents and relatives shouldn't label a child a "" Fairy ,"" or "" Faggot"" orstrange just because they dress a little different or are taughthow to do household chores, which is essential in later life, Ifirmly believe that all children should learn these basic skills.His thoughts and the word of God are compelling. I firmly believeeveryone has to look into his own heart and soul before they judge others. I give Tom Ward not 5 stars***** but 7 stars*******for a book well written.Joseph Frank Baraba"" Dusty ""Isbn # 1424120187"
1,"THE BLADE IS NOT 8""","I know someone else said this, but I had already bought the spatula. 8"" is the entire length from handle to tip."
4,House Grooves and Downtempo Joints,"The Black Mighty Orchestra have put out an record that crosses from up beat house music to downtempo relaxing. All instruments are played live and there is little sampling and drum machine work. The groove of the a rhodes organ gives each track a funky groove especially on their cover of the Doors ""Light My Fire"" where the vocalist sounds like a modern day Shirley Bassey If your into great music and fancy bands like Morcheeba or Supreme Beings of Leisure, check this out!"
3,Girls will like this CD much better then Boys.,This is not Adam's best cd- but it is pretty good. There are a few songs I skip past. Puss N Boots is a fun song and everybody knows Strip. Personally I could listen to Navel To Neck everyday for the rest of my life and not get sick of it. GEEZ he has a sexy voice. You wanna kiss me Adam?? PLEASE DO. If you havent heard Navel To Neck and you are a girl who thinks that Adam was as hot as they come- then you will ENJOY this song. Pretty much all the songs on this cd are about s-e-x. And I like Vanity and Playboy as well. Wait. Come to think of it- I like more songs then I thought! I do reccomend it. And looking at the picture inside is worth the price of the whole cd- trust me. He definately was thinking of the girls when he wrote the songs on this album- so guys maybe shouldn't bother.
1,From a lifelong Ant Fan,"I fear that the previous reviewer from New Hampshire has over enthused on this particular ant offering. It is without doubt adams poorest collection. I can't think of one track on this album that even compares with his best material. Slack production, slack songwriting - I don't think his heart was in it. Oh well back to listening to ""Dirk Wears White Sox"" - now thats what I call Antmusic."
1,Catastrophe!,"In the early 1980s, Adam Ant dominated the pop charts for all of eighteen months with some really irresistible hits: ""Stand and Deliver,"" ""Prince Charming,"" and ""Kings of the Wild Fronteir"" before he cracked the American market as a solo artist. Anyone looking for the tribal beats and twangy guitars that made his ""antmusic"" so distinctive will be big-time disappointed in ""Strip."" Granted, there are two polished-up but enjoyable singles on this album: ""Puss and Boots"" and the title track; both were produced by Phil Collins. Everything else is flat-out bad. ""Strip"" is really two singles weighed down by a whole lotta filler. If you wanna hear classic Adam Ant, get his earlier discs and avoid this. It flopped upon release in 1983, and for a good reason."
4,A Happy Medium,"I see where both of the other two reviewers are coming from. If you are a hardcore 'Dirk' and 'Wild Frontier'antperson, you may not care for how slick this release is but I will say that, underneath the overproduction, there are some great songs on this release. If you're looking to buy your first Adam Ant/and the Ants CD, I would highly recommend 'Kings of the Wild Frontier' or 'Antics in the Forbidden Zone (Best Of)'and keep going from there."
3,Cagney&Lacey,"Cagney &Lacey: The Complete Series- 30th Anniversary - Several of the cd's had problems with interruptions such as stopping, slowing and losing sound. The problems were irritating, but workable."
1,Not a very good quality product,"It is a great program but the quality of the product is of very low quality, season 2 third disc breaks in digtal sections, no picture or sound, through the series there are too many times the digital programs stop and go, and jumps to continue, I haven't even seen season one to check it out. This was a present for my wife and it would be nice to get a replacement that has gone through quality control."
2,Confusing format,"I am a great admirer of Burton Watson, especially his work on the Lotus Sutra. I got the Po Chui Kindle edition and I have a bone to pick with how text and titles are organized on the screen. Looks like someone did a straight PDF that did not quite convert. I would not recommend the Kindle title as it is to anyone."
1,Worst instructions I have ever seen,"In 43 years on this planet, this product comes with the most worthless set of instructions I have even seen."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I will start by saying this is the first thing I've purchased from Amazon that I am really disappointed in.From the time I opened the package my main thought was ""cheap"". I put the unit together as per instructions, but I was never able to get a spark. The trigger itself was very hard to push and I played with the arrangement of things for over an hour and it never worked once. I can do a lot of lighting the grill with my lighter in an hour! This thing went into the trash the day I got it."
2,"""POS""","I bought this kit to replace the original igniter that hasn't worked for years.The first problem is that the ground wire has the wrong connector so right of the bat you get a bad feeling about the quality of the product.Then the ignitor box won't attach to the burner without shorting out to the burner case so I cut an opening big enough to let it fit but I still could not get it to attach to the burner tube.I took the whole thing apart and attached the spark plug with a folder clamp.It finally worked but only 3 times, because the ignitor button would not snap back any more.I threw in the towel and admitted defeat, threw it in the trash and got out my gas lighter that I was using before I wasted an afternoon trying to get this piece of S*** to work.The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I was trying to attach it to a universal burner tube that it wasn't designed to fit so I gave it the benefit of the doubt."
1,Misinformation and Missing Information,"This is a terrible excuse for a guidebook. Its maps are blatantly incorrect: the subway map is a ballpark approximation, at best, and things in Central Park are not located where the map says they are, among others. Its attraction descriptions neglect crucial information about the details you actually need at the sites (the Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty in particular), and the restaurant descriptions do not show the complete picture. I don't throw out books I dislike, but this one is going straight to the recycling bin."
1,One of those YES... but... things.,At least TWO of the five star reviews said this pen sucks.It seems if you get one of these things it'll work until it breaks...if it arrived UN-broken in the first place... I'm gonna try different brand!
1,The pen breaks easily.,"The pen breaks easily. It's made in china. I was able to use it for a few minutes at most and it ended up breaking. The cap falls off so easily and if you try to put it back on, it still it wont work. It is poorly designed."
1,DOA,"Bought two of them.....both of them didnt work upon arrival dont waste your money. Plastic, flimsy and all around cheap."
1,no workie =/,"not sure if it had dead batteries in it or what, but it didnt work at all :( piece of junk"
3,"Great, inexpensive gag toy","After a while, of course the battery would wear off, but it does not still make it less of a working pen, for those new to products like this, the pen can extend by twisting the tip on the opposite end of the cap(the cap being the part that when pressed down like a normal pen, emits a shock)."
4,Great,"It is good, but the pen is a little bigger than the average pen, so it doesn't work on a careful person. The shock is good but not as strong as i would like it to be. People are not really surprised. Overall its a 3-4 stars. The shipping was good and it arrived 2-5 weeks before it was supposed to."
2,cool,"yes it shocks you, but why does it have to be so fragile? I got it broken, and bumping, even setting it on my bed kept braking the barrel of the pen. Dont expect to buy this if you know the one you are shocking will through the pen."
1,THis pen is crap,I was super excited when i got home to use my pen on my friends and family i opened up the package and the stupid pen didnt work what the freak so theres 4 dollars wasted
5,Shockingly Fun!,"A good shocking pen, especially for the price. I used it on a couple friends who always borrow pens and never return them! It just gives enough of a shock to give targets a jolt and leaves them feeling plenty surprised. Great gift for a practical joker!"
2,good for a 1 or 2 day gag,"the pen ws a cheap plastic, dont worry it does shock,when i recivied mine it had a crack on it, but its very cheap,so axpect nothing then what u are paying for"
1,didn't even arrive!,I was told it would be here about a month ago and never even arrived. They accepted my payment though.
1,My biggest disappointment.,"I ordered this product with the sole intention of getting the software so that I can print accurately on the labels. I was quite upset to discover that the software did not work on 3 of my computers. Clearly, it's not a computer error, the disk does not run at all and therefore, I was unable to install it."
2,Does Not Meet Expectations,The labels are often misaligned on disks due to the label sheets no matching the plastic label holder. Labels are cut unevenly and will unbalance your disk. NOTE: Printable CDs/DVDs and printers that support them are widely available and affordable these days. Look into investing in them if a pretty CD is a must for you.
5,no more setting times,"i live in area where brief power outages are all too common and it's great not having to set this clocks time... and the battery helps too.the display is large, bright, and clear, and is easily visible from across the room, night or day.i liked it so much, i purchased a second one."
4,Very pleased,I live in a mobil home and I have had problems in the past getting an FM radio to play clearly because of being surrounded by the metal that it takes to manufacture a mobil home.With the Emerson CKS22358 I have to say that I have found the solution to bringing in FM stations clearly and the jumbo numbers for the clock makes it very easy to see the time day or night.I strongly recommend this product to anyone that is searching for clear radio transmission.
2,OK Radio,"This is not an easy radio to tune. The sound is mediocre. The design is OK, but for the price it's not worth it. There are features I don't need. All I wanted was an alarm radio that's easy to tune with decent sound.It does set itself however -- big deal ..."
4,"great clock, but runs 2 minutes slow","I really like this clock. It really does set itself when you plug it in, and the display is nice and large. Only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it's consistantly 2 minutes slower than my atomic clock, so the time is not exact."
3,"So near, and yet so far","I really like this clock... The design, the finish, the functionality. If only it kept reasonable time, it would have been perfect for my needs.As it is, it loses 55 seconds per day, and when I am supposed to get up in the morning, I don't want to have to continually worry about whether the clock is getting more and more behind. I want to set my clock, and forget about it for the rest of the year.Clocks these days are a mature technology - I don't think it is very difficult to design & build a clock which keeps good time. I therefore have to presume that my particular clock is a dud, and that I was just unlucky. Nevertheless, my one will be being returned to Amazon for a refund.SEE ALSO COMMENTS SECTION BELOW FOR A CORRECTION."
2,Horrible!,"I received this clock radio today and when I plugged it in, the time was 5 minutes slow so I changed the time to the correct one and it went right back to being 5 minutes slow. I also cannot get very good reception at all. I think I will go back to a Sony, this one goes back tomorrow."
1,hunk of junk,The whole thing went completely dead after a couple of months. Hunk of junk. Threw it into the trash. Gave it one star only because Amazon wouldn't let me give it zero stars.
4,emerson clock work great,its real good i love it it the best next thing to have .it keep me on time for work and i would not use any other clock
4,Daughter liked this clock,"This was purchased as a gift for my daughter who needed a dual alarm clock. It is very similar to one that we had bought locally, but could no longer find. This was shipped directly to my daughter and she loved it."
4,Decent Alarm Clock,"Box was a little ragged, not sure if it was used before or not but product is FINE. Not too crazy about the alarm but it wakes me up"
1,Outdated Daylight Savings Chip,"Very Beautiful Clock BUT the daylight savings chip was outdated.The instuctions(at Emersonclocks website) on how to re set the daylight savings chip did not work. Emerson still has outdated Smartset models for sale so be aware..If I'm to remember to adjust the daylight savings,I can just get a regular clock.Come on Emerson ,,recall the outdated clocks."
3,I would not order from this company again,I had purchased this clock in the past from another entity and it was all set up to just work. It took me at least three days to program it to set at the corrrect time. I am sure this was an old version of the clock that had not been updated.
2,The alarm feature didn't work,"2.5 out of 5 (1 out of 2 radios were fully functional)I bought two of these clocks, one for myself to replace one that had lasted nearly 15 years, and one for my dad who needed a clock radio with a sleep setting. Whereas my father's clock continues to work well, the alarm function has never worked on my radio. Everything else on my radio has been functional, but since I needed an ALARM and a clock radio, I wasn't happy about that."
1,Old and not very useful,"I bought this book and The Flyfishers Guide to Utah. Comparing the two books, the Southwestern Colorado book lacks illustrations, especially maps, that I found useful in the Utah book. This book references the DeLorme maps. While the DeLorme maps are a must, its a quite a task to flip flop between the book and the DeLorme maps when you are trying to find the area that is being described in the book.This book is old and is probably outdated."
1,The same three reviews,"I've searched over 10 different website for customer reviews of this product. Every website had the same three ""customer"" reviews. Please try it for yourself... do a search for Clarocet customer reviews and see what you find. These so called ""customer"" reviews are definetly not from unbiased customers."
3,"Good information, but needed better editing.","I got this book yesterday to study for the MOSC tests. I'm still only working through the Word section, and keep finding problems with the text. For example, steps that are sentence fragments that don't make any sense, such as ""8. to the beginning of a document?"" There is no other text to suggest what exactly this step is trying to ask. Also, I have found two references in the first section to images or figures that don't exist. Lastly, there is an instruction to insert a graphic, presumably from the CD, but the graphic doesn't exist.The authors of this book collectively have many decades of experience with writing and editing books on computer software, yet these very basic mistakes were not caught. As a Technical Writer by trade, I believe this devalues the publication because it is not as useful as it should be. I gave it 3 stars to reflect this."
5,Jazz To The Max,The talent of these two men comes out when the first note is played. The mellow sound of the trumpet and the beautiful addition of the piano. Patrick and his brother are some of the most talented jazz players I have ever heard and this CD is a must have for any Jazz lover.
1,"verbose, simplistic, useless","I do not know who will benefit from reading this book.It is not a concise catalog of patterns. The patterns described are too obvious and simple.The ""anti-pattern"" example is ludicrous.The ""telecom"" patterns were too obvious. I was surprised that Coplien, for whom I have high respect for writing ""advanced C++"", contributed to some patterns. It seems that the author of the book was trying to fill in the pages somehow. I am an experienced developer. This book is almost useless to me. I am not certain how useful it is to other people like managers, students, etc."
2,Frame with no glass?,"Be very weary that this frame is just that, a frame. Nothing else to it. No glass at all. How is your puzzle supposed to remain in place? From the picture it looks like there could be one there but what a hoax. I was very disappointed with this purchase."
1,Not Impressed...,"I ordered this book, hoping to gain insight into the ""art of trompe l' oeil"" as suggested by the title. Instead I found myself bored with a book full of the same looking gaudy murals and images, with the same drab earthy palettes for each one. The ""how to's"" and I use that phrase lightly, are nearly nonexistence, except for the last 15 pages - which basically demonstrate the same faux stone relief technique, only using different motifs. I found this very useless! It almost feels as if the ""how to's"" were an after thought, or thrown in to fill the pages. Purchasing this book, with the understanding of it being a ""how to"", instructional guide to trompe l'oeil painting - I found it extremely dissapointing! Though the artist's work is OK, there was nothing new revealed here that isn't thoroughly covered in Grahm Rust's marvelous books, which I highly reccomend. Rust is an obvious matured muralist who graciously reveals his inspirations and knowledge on the subject with elegance."
2,Designer,"This is a very nice coffee table book, and for a beginning art novice there are some ""secrets"". But, for artist with general high school level education this is little more than a nice picture book.There is no discounting Yves Lanthier's skill or excellent creative ability but the few tips he gives are not for creating the Trompe L'oeil ceilings he exhibits in the book. Rather he shows simple stone / marble technique, a basic wall effect and basic light shading in the last fifteen pages of the book.This is not a book the speaks to basic line and eye illusion of ceiling depth which I was looking for."
2,Lovely Work,"There were lots of nice techniques in this book but found it a bit too ""fancy"" for me; notfor the every day painter or every day home."
1,does not work accurately,"I was looking forward to using the Dimension Pro. However, I am returning it. Perhaps I got a defective one but this device can not produce accurate measurements. I have tried repeatedly to use it on walls that I know the distance between and it simply does not display an accurate reading."
2,Very poor quality silicone,"This worked well for the first 3 times I used it, then it developed a small crack and I was no longer able to use it.Pros:Cakes came out easilyCons:Overall Quality"
2,Animatronics for Beginners,"If you have any basic electronic and mechanical application skills this guide will be a disappointment. It's for a beginner who are looking to get into a basic physics, electrical, and mechanical application without digging deep into them. Save your self the money get a basic radio shack book and look at other folks designs on the internet to get some design ideas. Good luck!"
4,Great resource on pneumatics and mechanical movements,"This was an excellent book for me to learn about pneumatics. I had no prior experience and was interested in creating pneumatic props for Halloween. The author clearly explains the different pneumatic components, sources, and tips while supporting explanations with good math.Additionally, the section on four-bar and accordion linkages was very useful.Note to other readers: The section on automation using microcontrollers is a little out of date, the amateur community is now adopting the Arduino microcontroller. Also, Grainger is mentioned as a source that only sells to businesses, but this is no longer the case."
2,Decent but not a practical guide.,The author gives you lots of information but mostly from a mathematical perspective. He clearly enjoys the math - I do not.He focuses a lot on electrical motors and I was more interested in pneumatic controls. I was looking for some real world prop designs that I could implement. Instead what I got was a LOT of mathematical equations - most of which the average prop designer is never going to use.The handbooks from [...] are much more useful in my opinion.
3,Not for Incense,"As a general book for people wanting to work with fragrant materials it has some contribution, but I couldn't recommend the techniques on making incense, or for someone looking for books on natural aromatics. That just isn't what this book is about."
1,The Concise Beatles Complete,"Musically grossly innacurate. Keys are not just a little off, but way off from the original recordings. What was the point?"
2,The book is in different keys than the recordings.,"I bought this book and was excited about being able to take it right home and play along to the Beatles recordings on my guitar. I opened up to ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and put on my Please Please Me CD and to my surprise and dismay the book was in a different musical key than the CD, way off! I'm assuming they did that to make the songs easier to play on piano, but it wasn't what I wanted. Disappointed I took the book back and then ordered The Complete Beatles Scores from Amazon. I've been much happier with that book."
4,Smorgasbord of Beatle Songs,"For people interested in playing Beatle songs on guitar, this is a nice little book that is a half a step above a book for complete beginners and is not quite at the intermediate level.The book offers a plethora of songs and I felt it was clear, direct and well written. I was also quite pleased with the selection of songs."
5,The Essence of Karate-Do,This is the most complete and indepth book to explain the world of Karate from the most advance martial artist to novice. I have truly been enlightened. It was a pleasure.
3,A Decent Collection,"Wamsley's strength is his proximity to events and his ability to gather relevant documents from the original Mothman days in 1966 and 1967. The interviews are rather weak and don't offer anything beyond what has already been reported and explored. I'm inclined to suggest a 2.5 star rating. The book isn't quite worthy of the three stars given, but it has enough archive information that it doesn't warrant a two. This book is a great item for people who are addicted to Mothman lore, but Keel's original The Mothman Prophecies is still the bible on the events in Point Pleasant."
3,Thumbs Up and Down,Content is great with Japanese proverbs providingmind pictures and detailed explanations for variouspatterns. However the layout is terrible. You constantlyhave to flip pages to see his reference exhibits. Also he doeslittle to show setups: entry and exit points in real trades. Ireccommend the book but be prepared to be frustrated!
5,Candlesticks and more explained,"In-depth explanations of how and why candlesticks work, plus additional topics. Easy to read/study with plenty of examples. The organization is logical, each section building on previous information. Easy to cross reference through the index and contents pages."
5,you've read the rest....,"you've read the other reviews- there's nothing more to say. buy it. that's my advice. it's an amazingly well written book and trust me, it can help you make a lot of money. BUY IT AND READ IT. trust me, it's worth it."
5,Great Introductory Book,"This is a great book that offers all the basic info about candle charting and provides clear examples. I was able to get a copy of it from my library network and the info is relatively easy to remember, so having the book as a reference tool may not be needed if you can check it out from a library."
5,trade understanding improved,I am a begginer in studying the financial markets and I found this book great because besides japanese candlesticks I learnt about western technicals too. The subjects are well explained and easy to understand.
5,Very good book.,This book has a good balance in tecnology and theory. Very goog for the financial people.
3,"Worth it, but not perfect","I am literate in the world of technical analysis, and I have had some experience with candlesticks in the past. This book was a comprehensive introduction to candlestick techniques. The author is a bit full of himself, and there's a lot of filler, but overall it was worth the [...] bucks because he knows what he's talking about."
1,Save your $$$. The information is available free on the internet,"I think the book is overly rated. The information Nison teaches is available online free. Just Google ""stockcharts candlesticks"".He gave many examples why they work, but I can also give you many examples why it doesn't. Trading in real time with these pattern going to kill loss your capitals really really fast.I use candlestick chart because it give me a easier view than other type of charts. I do not use any of the patterns. I only care if a bar is strong or weak. If it strong, it tell me that either the bull/bear is in control. When it is weak, neither is in control and I stay away."
5,japanese candlestick charting techniques by steve nison,"IN todays volitile markets,a tool is of great importance which can give an early signal.For a day trader,all the western techniques are not useful as they give signals for long term trades.NISON has given me a new dimension to look at the charts by giving the Reversal Patterns,Continuation Patterns. I find the reversal patterns are the most rewarding as one can make maximum money if one can spot the Reversal. By reading this book,I can say that Nison has given me this niche to locate the reversals."
5,Ultra-excellent book.,"This book has opened up a whole new world of technical analysis for me. The subject matter is fascinating--the Japanese make everything they do into an art, and charting is no exception. These chart patterns are easy to learn because they make intuitive sense. Nison points out (wherever relevant) what each formation means in terms of market psychology and sentiment. The ""emotional"" side of the market is much more difficult to read using Western techniques -- at least for me. But with candlesticks I can really get a gut feeling for what is going on, in addition to a clearer analytical view. Nison is an excellent writer and makes everything clear and understandable. He includes an introduction on the history of candlesticks which is interesting. The book is beautifully layed out, with plenty of room in the margins for making notes. The charts are easy to read.I cannot recommend this book enough."
1,full time pro trader,"if you thinking about buying this book... STOP you will never make money in the market by knowing the shapes of candle sticks. all the information is available online for free. just put candle stick into your search...with so many products and books ....you will do better by trying to use those pattern while trading and see what works for you... Again all the info is free online and you should never pay anyone who try to sell you ""the way...""you will save alot of $$$$$$ if you understand this early. with more then 12 years experience... there are no more then 5 books that you should really read. this one is for sure not one of them! save it $$$"
3,Japanish Candlestick,"This book is nice looking, but this book is not very good help to investing.You learn from this book how to look candlestick, but this book don't give you any INVESTING RULE or HINT to you.If you want learn to investing, go buy Peter Lynch investing books. They are really good to investors."
1,A complete ripoff in big font and double space type,"Steve Nison is desperately trying to fill pages. A big font and double spaced book may appeal to elementary school kids but not a professional traders. The whole book could be condensed to about 25 pages. This book is over priced, dry and boring.If you want to read and enjoy learning about candlesticks, Steven Bigalow's book is great (and cheap).Nison is trying to impress the reader with his knowledge of about 10 Japanese phrases, which is lame. Please spend half the money on a much better book. Nison is making money by selling books and seminars, not trading. What surprises me is how some people, can publish stuff with no substance.I found this book completely useless."
5,This is really good stuff,If you like contemporary poetry this is the book for you. The wide range of styles contained in the book is amazing. It revived my own desire and ability to write. It is the perfect companion to Six American Poets. I can not wait for Conarroe's next work.
3,Buy two!,"I knew in the beginning that this couldn't be super high quality memory foam, because of the price (plus I had a hard time finding the pound per square inch rating), we bought two and put them both on our king sized bed for 4 inches of memory foam yumminess.2 is WAY better than 1. It is so incredibly comfortable now. It wasn't what I was expecting (marshmallow softness and sinking into the mattress) but it's more comfortable. It's the perfect combination of firm support and comfortable softness. My fiance loves loves loves them and tells me the bed is ""dangerously evil"" now, because you can't lay on it without falling asleep. Definitely use a mattress pad, just to keep the mattress safe from sweat and stuff.Ours didn't smell bad, maybe for half an hour, but don't think you can just lay them down on the bed and nap either...you have to give them time to expand and unwrinkle."
3,"2"" Memory Foam Topper","Very comfortable. Just the thing if your current mattress is a little hard or lumpy. Won't help with a saggy mattress though.Comfort Clinic 2-Inch VE Memory Foam Mattress Topper, Queen"
3,Not as comfy as I expected but,could be I have no memory foam experience. It is a plus definately then just mattress. I expected more for sure but who knows like I said....this is my first one.
2,"Comfort Clinic 2"" memoryfoam mattress topper","The topper is soft...however, it never unfolded out into a perfect rectangle (it is odd shaped) & I don't think it is a full 2""."
1,Memory Foam,"The foam pad was dirty, looked like it was used. It was nasty looking when unfolded and took 4 days to fully decompress. I would not have purchased it if I had known these things."
2,Cracked is what it WAS up to be,"When I received the King sized topper I noticed that, while still in the package, the foam had a large crack, the full length of the package. Thankfully I noticed before I unraveled the whole thing since it only fits inside the bag using a special condensing process. I don't believe that a quality foam would rip during the manufactures own packaging process. Amazon is great and made the return easy and free but still a waste of time. I did give it two stars because you can't find any type of King pad for this price so I suppose it could be worth it, if you could get one out of the bag whole:)"
3,You get what you pay for....,"I was glad to find a mattress topper for my XL twin bed at a reasonable price, but I don't think that the foam is what I would call true ""memory foam"". It is not as comfortable as a previous topper that I had---which was too short for my bed, unfortunately for me. I was supicious when I unwrapped the topper, as the foam appeared to be a less dense type of foam than what I expected. Oh well, it is still better than my regular mattress alone."
4,Felt good,We got this over a year ago and loved it from the moment we put it on the bed. We got a new bed and had to get rid of it. The only thing I don't like is that it changes dark orange with sweat. My husbands side was gross looking to me.
2,Get what you pay for,"Other internet sales sites sell 2 inch memorey foam for more money. I have bought from them as well and their foam seems to spring to shape quicker and have a softer feel. This topper seems 'squishy' for lack of a better description. I bought it for my camper, because the mattress in my older model camper needed help. It was inexpensive though and will probably be adequate."
4,I like it,This product is OK... I wanted one that felt like my mom's bed (she bought hers for $100 at Bed Bath and Beyond). This is firmer than hers but just as comfortable... it just doesn't have that cuddle into bed feeling.Edit: I was shocked to see that the price of this topper is now $100. A lot of these reviews were based on the previous selling price of $40.
2,Not actually queen sized,"This memory foam piece was not nearly the same size as the other queen sized piece I purchased. But other than that, it's comfortable."
5,Scholarly and Fair,"I read and disected this book and found it very ballanced and well researched. Dr. Furuli has full grasp of the ancient languages and paints a picture regarding this much maligned translation that the average person out there will never see if left purely up to what other biased academics have to say. It's sad that because of fundamentalist and clergy opinion of the religion who uses this translation (among many other renditions, I might add) one can rarely sift through the bunk to find an honest evaluation of this work. Well, here is one evaluation that you put on your shelf and feel good about. It is often said that man fears most what he does not understand. I feel that after reading this book, that will no longer be an issue with most who keep an open and non-prejudicial mind."
1,Just One Agenda,"Very briefly, this book is exactly what the title says: a 'look' at the New World Translation. Unfortunately, this 'look' is a long-winded and intricate apologia for the sect's own Bible translation, whose New Testament is doctored to fit their particular heresies. The Old Testament, however, is mediocre, with appalling grammar and syntax. But, no repectable Bible translator worth his salt would endorse the New Testament, and they have stated such. Much better Bible translations abound...in fact, ANY other translation is better."
5,Nightwisher,This DVD is amazing!!!! TARJA does such a wonderful performance! I really recommend this DVD to any Nightwish or Tarja fan. Each cd is about 2 hrs and it has lots of songs. I bought the DVD not the Bluray and it works great! Shipping was very good too!
4,Ten More Tales...A Solid Effort,"I am new listener to this very underrated band from the UK! I purchased their latest effort, Perfect Balance, first, and I have most recently purchased Ten More Tales. This is a very solid effort on this band's part, and I highly recommend Ten More Tales and Perfect Balance to any power/prog metal fan."
4,Can Objects Become People?,"There are many AW books that concentrate on paintings or eras of his art. This is a good overall view of the man and his life and art. It is good, but not a substitute for, the real experience of viewing the paintings and letting them sink into your own mind. For myself, listening to his matter-of-fact comments about various works and reading the author's summaries and paraphrases of aspects of his art or life are less interseting than what seems to be between the lines. AW is an artist who sees the human imprint on objects & places and gives them reverence in the form of observation as witness to their authenticity. Yipe. Just read the book"
4,For those who love Wyeth,"I ""met"" Wyeth accidentally (not so known in Italy), and I felt the need to know more about this extraordinary artist.The book is matching my expectations.GT"
2,What! a 40% price jump!?,"I am a regular/returned shopper for this item. I like the product,but was totally surprised and disappointed at the ridiculous price jump. It completely turns me off."
4,It Helps Bread Rise,"I was just given a new bread Machine and was making all sorts of bread. I seen this inreceipes, so I bought some. Great packaging and price. I have used it in my whole wheatbread and came out great."
5,This Wheat Gluten makes the difference!,I am so glad that I did my research when I started baking my homemade artisan loaves. Wheat gluten makes a big difference in the texture and rising of the dough! Great product. I bought the six-box pack and I am storing the extras in the freezer. Thanks again!
5,Fabulous Hodgson Mill Vital Wheat Gluten,"I make bread every week using my bread machine. I use white flour, white whole wheat flour and whole wheat flour in my breads. My formula for turning plain flour into bread flour is simply to add 1 teaspoon of Hodgson Mill Vital Gluten to 1 cup of flour and the results are perfect every time. I learned this technique from an Interent How-to-Do feature and I have never changed the gluten/flour ratio because of the continued wonderful results.This is a great product that I would not be without, if I want to continue having perfect bread. Thank you Hodgson Mill.Theresa LambertiHouston, TX"
5,I can customize my toolbelt right on the job,"I use the entire Task tool belt system. The belt sleeve can always stay on my belt and I just need to clip on the pouch or holster I need. It is particularly handy for the Task drill holster because I can clip on when I need it, and shed it and the drill together when I am finished. No more excess weight around my waist. I can put a nail pouch or screw pouch or large pouch or electrician's tool pouch or timberframe chisel sheath as I need. I build timberframes. I found the Task stuff at a show."
4,Worked As Expected,"We bought two of these alarms because water had been backing up in the sink and nearly overflowing in the basement due to blockage in a line on the street. The very first evening the devices worked and easily paid for themselves. As far as the issue with decible levels, I will say that there was a discernable difference in the loudness of one compared to the other. But, even on the second floor, we heard the weakest one without difficulty. Would it have woken us up in the middle of the night on the second floor. Maybe --- but I'm not sure. I do know that I would recommend the product to others.Jan., 2011 Update It's been two and a half years since the review above and yesterday this alarm helped save a major water issue in the basement due to a malfuncition of the hot water heater pressure release valve. No deterioration in sound or function."
3,"If you have a basement, I do not recommend this alarm","As they say in other reviews, the alarm does not sound strong enough. I live in a small department of about 1,162 ft2 and I bought it to put it in the laundry room, I did the test that indicated in the instructions, it worked very well as they say, but barely heard in my bedroom with the TV on. I think if you plan to use in a basement will be very difficult to hear when the alarm sounds, I think it will modify an old smoke alarm for use in place of this product. It is very good idea, It is very good idea, but I don't know why the manufacturer failed to take into account the comments and has made product with a more powerful alarm."
4,Leaky pipes,"I have always been afraid of having a pipe spring a leak without my knowing and needed an alarm that would let me know there was an issue. These little alarms are great - small, no too loud."
4,Good Warning System,"After having our basement flood, we purchased this product. This product has done a good job of letting us know of any impending problems. It will not make the problem go away but is a great warning device. It is small and inconspicous. It works basically like a smoke detector but for water. The only requirement is that the device must come in contact with the offending water. We have placed ours in the sump pump pit on a ledge instead of outside the pit on the floor because by then it would be too late:)"
1,Loud as a dead mouse,"the product claims 95dB, same as a fire alarm. its not. its more like a pleasant warning, maybe an alarm clock snuggled under two pillows. Loud enough to be heard next door but will never wake anyone up unless it is jammed into their ear. Buy it if the volume is not a consideration, avoid if you plan to use in the basement."
1,cheap product,This product is VERY cheaply made!! I couldn't even close the cover on a couple of them... I returned them and Amazon was very nice about it and I received a refund promptly....
4,Could be louder,"I purchased this water alarm to be placed under my water heater and also by the washing machine. They work great as I just tested by wetting my finger and touching the electrodes. My only complaint is the loudness of the alarm. It is very noticeable in the same room, however they are very hard to hear elsewhere in my home."
4,perfect for my situation,"my sump pump cratered one day. some water spilled on the basement floor. after replacing the pump, i bought one of these and set it on the sump cover. so if and when the pump fails again, i am ready. simple product but effective."
3,Buy them,Out of the twelve I purchaced one did not work!! They wii deffinetyl pay for themselfs on the first warning of a leak.
5,water detector,"Great product, has saved my floors a couple of times. I have them everywhere water can leak now."
2,Wish it was louder,"Too bad the sound alarm is not loud enough to hear it in the basement. Hopefully,our dog will hear it and give us some warning."
4,these things work great,"i have a shower, toilet, laundry room with a washer dryer and a furnace hot water heater in my basement, since I am not down there every day I needed a warning system I can hear and trust also one that does not need battery replacement often, the Zircon 63931 leak alert fits that bill, its loud enough to hear if I open the basement door and listen, it has already saved me money by detecting a small leak by the hot water heater which was fixed, I feel this product is worth the price since you get three detectors with batteries, Michael N.Y"
2,Would work better with proper batteries,"Bought the three pack of Zircon water alarms. Each one comes with a 9V battery - nice that they're included, but disappointing that all three batteries arrived dead. Not so helpful!"
1,The Alarm That Isn't an Alarm -- Piece of Junk,"Numerous others have reported that the alarm is substantially less than the advertised 95 dB. Despite their warnings, I bought it anyway thinking that if it says it's 95 dB loud that it must be pretty loud. It isn't. My house is pretty quiet. I put it in my basement next to my water heater. I can't hear it from across the basement, let alone from upstairs. Thinking that maybe it wasn't as loud as adverstised might have something to do with the brand-new battery not being up to strength, I changed to another new battery. No better. Completely useless for its intended purpose.I might suggest re-branding it as an anti-sleeptime drool biofeedback device. Put it on your pillow, if you drool at night, it'll sound. But no fears . . . it won't wake your sleeping partner!In all seriousness, it's useless for any application that is more than a room away."
3,not loud either,product works as stated - but is not as loud as I'd like.Hard to hear the product in the basement when on the first floor with the TV at a moderate level - can't hear it at all from the second floorI purchased 3 different products wanting to compare and find a good warning device and all are about the same - bottom line is its better than nothing but far from optimalReliance Controls THP205 Sump Pump Alarm and Flood Alert - RelianceSonin 00700 Water Alarm with Remote Sensor - by SoninZircon 64003 Water Detector with Leak Alert -by Zircon
4,Works as Expected,The product works as advertised. I've placed it in the closet that contains my water heater to alert me if there is ever a leak.
3,Not very loud!,"The unit is relatively cheap and I seems to work as expected. However, everyone should know that the unit is not very loud at all.I thought 95 decibels would be very loud, and I even put earplugs in before I tested it the first time. According to [...], 95db should be louder than a lawnmower or motorcycle. NO WAY.It's just a normal-volume beep, not much louder than you would expect from a small alarm clock. Certainly no louder than a cell phone set on high. So if you're planning to install this in your basement or garage and expect to hear it upstairs, forget about it!"
4,Very Loud but works well,"I put these under the toilet so any water leaks would sound the alarm. Also put some under the sink. These alarms work great and sound the alarm. Only issue was the alarm kept going even after I wiped it dry, I had to unplug the battery and re-plug it to reset the alarm. It might have reset after some time if I had waited but since the alarm is super loud I could not wait."
2,A little louder,"The alarm is not really loud. In fact, it is a beeping sound that I would not really consider an ""ALARM"". I seriously doubt this would wake even the lightest of sleepers. The product does work when water is present, but if placed in a remote location, it may not help. Good Luck."
1,ZIRCON 64003 Water Detector,"My main problem with this product is that the alert sound is far below the level of any smoke detector. The alarm can barely be heard on the first floor with the device set down in the basement. Other than the extremely low alarm sound, the product works as advertised. Not recommended for placement where your going to have it placed in any room where the door may be closed, as you will never hear it."
2,"Its an OK product, but I found a better one.","This one works pretty good but the battery life in mine didn't last long and the biggest problem is you almost need a puddle of water to have it go off. Great deal for $10 but I upgrade and spent a bit more ($30 - I know, expensive huh) and got a more durable/reliable one at http://www.thewateralarm.com"
1,very weak alarm,These water leak alarms are not loud enough to get your attention unless you are in the same room with them. I would not recommend them.
4,Water Detector,"Item was shipped quickly. Seems to work as advertised (in a test). Luckly no water leaks to make a real test, but expect it will work as advertised.JH"
3,Not loud enough,"This alarm is not very loud, as other reviewers have noted. There are louder alarms available if you intend to use it in a remote area such as a basement."
1,A SINGLE USE ALARM,"Purchased this zircon alarm twice. Both times it sounded off correctly when in contact with water. If you are not home and the unit sits in water it will corroid quickly. Or if the unit sits in a damp area it will corroid and then the alarm fails. It is a cheaply made, low price unit. Use it once and throw it away for your own safety. We now have a different brand flood alarm unit. Same costs better made."
4,Good water detector and alarm,"I placed this unit next to my hot water tank. It never went off until I came back from a trip during winter. The pipe near the hot water tank became either frozen or very cold because I shut off the furance. So when I turned the furnace back on, the frozen pipe started to heat up and created condensation that had water dripping on the floor near the hot water tank. Luckily the alarm did its job and I learned a lesson not to leave furance completely off during winter. I plan to put another one near the basement in case there's a flood. The cost is quite reseaonable but I wish it had come with a battery or I would've given it five stars."
4,Best $10 I've spent!!!,"Purchased one of these a few months ago. Placed it in utility room with water heater just in case. Water heater sprung a leak six days ago and thank goodness I had this item! It immediately sensed the water and the alarm sounded. Heard it from the family room and possibly saved me 100's if not 1000's of dollars. Was able to shut off the water and drain the tank without much flooding.Only con I have about this item is that could be louder, but in this case it did the job!"
1,Poor design,"Worked fine right out of the box. But is very susceptible to water damage, especially with such a large opening for the siren. After some water got in it stopped working. I wonder why they couldn't make it waterproof since it is supposed to be placed in wet places."
3,water alarm,unit works OK but its not loud enough. I have it under my kitchen cabinet and its hard to hear when it alarms. I guess its about what one would expect based on the price.
5,These detectors are great,The Zircon Leak Alert Water Detector works great. Every so often just check it to see if the battery needs to be replaced.
5,Easy to install,"I shopped around for similar devices and ultimately settled on the Zircon because of price and functionality. Obviously I hope I won't have to find out how well they work but I'm confident they'll get the job done. Very easy to set up, test and install."
4,It worked when I tested it.,"It worked when tested, although I hope to never really find out if it works cause that would mean I have water in my basement. It is a good warning to have, I would definitely get one, especially at this price (3 pack)."
5,Great value product,"I bought one of these for each sink, laundry, ice maker supply, water tank, dishwasher, A/C condensor and aquarium. They use 9v cells not provided. Use anywhere where leaks may be an issue. Simple and effective device."
3,Love the title song Chicken,"Upbeat, fun, unusual, need more songs like Chicken. I'd like another helping, please. Unfortunately, not all songs on this CD sing like Chicken."
2,More of the same.,"The storyline follows the troubled training of Black Minx, one of the Black's daughters. Of course in the end, Henry Daily and Alec Ramsay help her overcome her fears and become a champion. This plot has been done so many times and Farley hardly distinguishes himself in the re-telling. I personally think that the series should have stopped at ""The Black Stallion's Blood Bay Colt."" Overall, an unsatisfying read and not worth my money."
3,One of the better books in the series (later that is),"I really enjoyed reading ""The Black Stallion's Filly"". Of course we all knew right from the get-go that Black Minx would win the Derby; the process was fascinating. This story really centers more on Henry and Black Minx, more than Alec and the Black. Henry's solutions for curing Black Minx of her bad habits and foibles were wonderful.Oh and BTW, in response to an earlier reviewer's query: in the first chapter of the first book it is plainly stated that the Black is ""too big to be pure Arabian"". Additionally, in Book #2 (The Black Stallion Returns) Abu Ishak states that Shetan (the Black) is NOT a purebred Arabian. However, even if the Black WAS a purebred Arab, the Jockey Club was still registering Arabians up though 1943 (the first book in the series was published in 1941). One more thing - at least one offspring of the Black already WON the Kentucky Derby - Satan, in the book ""The Black Stallion and Satan"". Just FYI."

2,"DESERVES SOME CREDIT, BUT TOO LONG AND SLOW!","I heard many great things about this film, but unfortunately for me it just didn't hold my interest. The film moves along at a glacier's pace, which wouldn't be that bad if the story gave me something to grab on to. I could have read the book in the dark faster than watching this film!On the plus side, I give the film makers credit for trying to make a serious western although not nearly as truthful as they would like you to believe. The acting is very good, with a strong cast and the film looks beautiful, but in the end, I knew where it was going and I didn't learn anything new, I didn't know at the beginning of the film! It's long, slow and will leave you scratching your head as the credits role.....if that's your idea of entertainment....then by all means........knock yourself out!"
2,Very Disappointing,"This is a very slow movie. I guess it's only saving grace was the potrayal of Jesse as a thug and hoodlum, as opposed to other more heroic depictions."
1,"Longest, boring movie you will ever see!","I don't even think Pitt made an attempt to act in this picture! It would havebeen better, if he wasn't even in it. He was as entertaining as a wet orientalnoodle, stuck between your teeth. They had to shoot him, just so thestory line would pick up and some action would take place. If you like adark, dingy, slooooowwwww paced movie, starting a boring actor, this isthe one for you and almost three booorrriinnggggg hours long."
1,Never gets any better,"I am sorry, based on the reviews this should have been a good movie and mayby it is, but four of us sat down to watch it, and it moved so slooooooowwww, after an hour we all looked at each other and decided to see if it got any better, NOT. We didn't even finish it. It might be factual and the most accurate account of the death of Jesse James, but do they have to kill the viewers? I am surprised based on this film that he didn't commit suicide if his life was so boring....Wish I could get my $20 dollars back."
1,Not what I expected,"This movie was not what I expected at all. It is very slow-paced. Maybe I just didn't ""get"" it, but I found it extremely boring and didn't even finish the movie. I'm sorry I added it to my wish list! I thought after hearing the very positive reviews and seeing who was in the cast that it would be worth my time, but I was wrong. Don't waste your time watching this film!"
2,Last Train to Nowhere,"A disappointing art-house Western that languished on the shelf for two years. Despite standout performances by Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck, director Andrew Dominik's revisionist take on the legendary outlaw remains as long-winded as its title. The mesmerizing cinematography of Roger Deakins cannot redeem this 160-minute sleeping pill."
1,Poor Brad Pitt,"I have always been a Brad Pitt fan and enjoyed all of his movies..except this one. Very slow moving and because the dialogue is delivered in such a ""mumble mode"" fashion it was very hard to hear and thus extremely hard to follow. His portrayal of Jessie James was interesting and probably more characterisic of the outlaw than has been portrayed for years. Did not even finish the movie."
2,A tiresome experience,"If Jesse James was really so void of personality and depth as Brad Pitt portrays him to be, then there should never have been a movie about him. There are attempts to give the guy some soul, but it doesn't work. I don't know why, maybe Pitt simply can't help being himself, and brings to the screen a very confused man who tries to be cool, cocky and depressed at the same time, but you feel it doesn't make for natural viewing at all. Even the way he speaks sounds very unnatural. He finds it very hard to play anything but himself.The only redeeming feature, and the only engaging character in this film is Robert Ford, played by a magnificent Casey Affleck. He's the only guy one can connect with, even though he's a misguided, delusional youth.That's where the compliments end. Because the film sets out as a deep character study of people without character, and cares not a iota about thrilling or entertaining with plots, it turns out to be one loooong failure. 3 out of 10."
2,Not what I was expecting,The sets and costumes are good. Brad Pitt's acting is good. That's about it.The movie was boring and I couldn't understand half of what Casey Affleck was saying as he mumbled.I was expecting a great movie. Disappoinment!
2,boring and bad,"i love westerns, almost all of them. this one, however, isn't worth the hassle of getting. it is boring, slow to develop, underacted, and simply annonying. casey affleck is a horrible, horrible actor. i can't believe that this was the best they could do. anyway, skip this waste of time."
1,Disappointing,"Service was great from Amazon, but this movie was very disapponting to say the least. Does Brad Pitt know how to produce a movie? I think not!"
4,Great biopic...taken with a grain of salt,"All of the actors do an outstanding job bringing the story of Jesse James' final few months to life. Casey Affleck, in particular, earned a whole new respect from me. The movie is shot in superb style and the effect is very haunting."
2,You will never get the 2 1/2 hours of your life back...,"While Brad Pitt gives a tremendous performance, the movie rambles and is much too long. The worst, though, is Casey Affleck's impossibly unpleasant performance and terrible diction. I'll make sure to avoid any production that has him for a cast member."
4,"slow moving, but worth the wait.","The film was adapted from Ron Hansen's 1983 novel of the same name. Unlike Jesse James movies of the past, Andrew Dominik's film is presented as a psychoanalytical historical epic rather than a shoot-'em-up western. The movie details the outlaw's deteriorating psyche during his final months of life as he slowly succumbs to paranoia and develops a precarious friendship with his eventual assassin, Robert Ford. Ford, who grew up idolizing James and wishing to join the gang himself, sets off on a mission to Glendale, Missouri, where the James-Younger Gang are staging the last train robbery of their careers. The strange relationship between the two men is examined over the course of the film. The movie is a little slow, but worth sticking with as it picks up at the end."
5,This film blew me away!,"What a little gem of a flick. If you are a Brad Pitt fan or a fan of westerns or a fan of American History - do not miss this one! Terrific acting, you feel as if you are right alongside the characters. Nice to see Sam Shepard as well! Was not too familiar with Sam Rockwell before, but he stole my heart in this one."
3,Brad Pitt as Jesse James,"This movie presents Jesse James and Robert Ford as the criminals they were. Other such movies often present Jesse James as a Robin Hood type folk hero rather than outlaw. For that reason, and a cast that includes Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck, it is worth viewing."
4,>Very different<,"The acting is mint. This is a film that holds to nuances and specifics as it relates to the period it outlines. Its a rare type of western that has a glorious filming quality. The story of Jesse James and his plight has never been captured in such rich detail. The surrounding charactors make the movie.Where it did come up a little short was in the area of cohesion. A couple of scenes dwelled on some minor players that became little movies in themself, that never panned out. As well, films with narration always need to be careful. This bordered on narritive overkill. The eye and ear can pick up many subtleties without a hovering voice. The makers werent sure if they were doing a tv bio on J.J. or a poignant film. Fortunately, the latter took over. Its an emotional western that draws the viewer into the gut feelings of the people and time. Well crafted and highly recommended especially those who are not only looking for the next bit of quick gun slinging."
1,Brad is the pits as Jesse Lames,"snore......, what a waste of time and film, occassional glimpses of an ""authentic"" west made it tolerable, the dialogue a muttered mess, I had to fast forward most of the last third of the movie. Michael Cimino's Gates of Heaven shines next to this muddy mess of a movie. I would have walked out of the theater had I went, as it was, this was the most disappointing over-hyped movie in a long while for me, comparisons to The Unforgiven are hard to understand, perhaps it was all the darkness and low illumination. I was hoping for something along the lines of The Long Riders, sorry, this one missed the mark. Brad Pitt trying to expand his repertoire and add an art film western to his repertoire doesn't cut it. And please, no comparisons to Terence Malick,give me Days of Heaven any day over this moody muddy self indulgent effort."
1,Pedestrian,"An intensely slow, boring, and superficial look at what should have been a very interesting and exciting character. An utter waste."
1,"slow and boring, poor acting","Seeing this movie selected in msn's 10 best western movies prompted me to write a review. This movie would not make the top 1000. I like Brad Pitt as an actor, but the thinking of anything he's in is a 5 star movie is a falcity. This movie is way too long and way too boring. I thought none of the actors put forth an effort worthy of the subject matter, and the lack of action worthy of the subject matter was very disappointing. I have put this dvd aside to trade in. For a much better film on Jesse James, see The Last Days Of Frank and Jesse James with Johnny Cash & Kris Kristofferson. It stands head and shoulders above this one on the subject of Jesse James."
1,Boring...boring....boring,"If you enjoy counting the number of holes in the ceiling tiles of your office or enjoy watching paint dry on the wall, this movie is definitely for you.This was just about the most boring movie I have ever watched. I tried giving the Blu Ray away twice and had it given back to me both times after they watched it.That should tell you a whole lot about the movie."
4,And There Will Be Blood...,"If you liked that movie, you'll love this one. They should be sold together.... they're almost identical...and that's a good thing!Classic delivery; introspective, bittersweet... like yer livin' it, right there with 'em..."
4,Long title for a long movie,"I really thought this movie was going to be over the top. I mean it does star Brat Pitt after all. I found the movie to drag along at times, and some of the movie does not follow facts but mostly it does. I think that in the end Robert Ford got what he deserved as he was just as guilty as Jesse in ways. If you really want to experience what Jesse must have been feeling at that point in time I recomment you watch the movie. However, you must be able to sit and pay attention or you will miss something important and be totally lost. The plot played out well in the end and I ended up feeling sorry for Jesse who was doing what he thought was best, even if he was breaking the law. We have to remember the history behind why Jesse and Frank did what they did. Would we have done differently if someone tried to rip our lives away from us?"
1,"Very Bad, Very Boring, and too damn Long","This movie had very little action and was long and boring. I think it was trying to be an art film and make some kind of moralistic statement. However, I am not really sure what that statement is? This movie should be avoided. I couldn't wait for it to end about half way through it. I almost turned it off before it was over. This movie is a real stinker. It is no wonder it never went into nation wide release."
1,Wasted money,"very slow, boring and totally unwatchable movie, after I saw it, I can easy imagine 1000 better things to spent those 19.95 on.Beleive me, if is not too late, pick any other DVD...."
4,Languorous and beautiful to watch,"There are many reasons to watch this film - the first is Casey Affleck and his characterisation of Robert Ford and Brad Pitt as Jesse James and the backup work of the likes of Sam Shepard. The second is the photography in which the Canadian landscape provides such a stunning verisimilitude to the ""West"". The third is the tone very much helped by the excellent music provided by Nick Cave. Overall a class above most ""westerns"" and an excellent film well worth re-viewing."
3,THE BEST THING WAS THE SCENERY ... UNFORTUNATELY,"I was a bit disappointed in this film. The scenery was spectacular but the movie itself was way too long. Of course, Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck were great, but the movie drug on and on with sometimes meaningless dialog. I think 20 minutes or more could have been edited from the movie and not made a difference in the outcome. I am, however, glad I have added it to my DVD film library as I think Brad Pitt is a fantastic actor in everything he plays in."
5,Jesse James the Human Being,"Just like the incredible book by Ron Hansen on which it is lovingly based, The Assassination of Jesse James is a lyrical and poignant look at the last years of the outlaw's life. James is portrayed as ornery, dangerous and unpredictable but also as a weary and tired man who realizes too late that the life he is living can only last so long. I was a bit uncomfortable with Brad Pitt in the role at first, but he comes to inhabit the character quite well. Beautiful cinematography too, and excellent acting all around. This will be one that I will purcase and keep. Too bad there are no special features - this kind of film deserves them."
4,The Assassination of Jesse James,"I loved the setting and the characters. It stirred my emotions. That's what makes a good movie. I was taken by the ending. And yes, I loved the music. The ""Song for Bob"" is my kind of music. I now listen to it on my Pandora.TitleTitle: The Assassination of Jesse James staring Brad Pitt"
3,Some unrealized potential,"On the plus side, the cinematography and shooting locations are superb; Brad Pitt gives a complex performance; the music is more than suitable; the subject matter has not really been given a full treatment before.Problems: although I have no trouble with slow-moving films, this one was slowly paced for no good reason, had too many lengthy tracking shots, too many pauses and silences. At 2 hours and 20 minutes, the film was obviously made that long only because somebody couldn't bear to leave even a few bits of it on the cutting room floor.So take a look but don't be afraid to fast forward now and then---that is, if you are still awake."
4,A Terrence Malick-esque Drama in the West,"A few thoughts, in no real order --1. Though Terence Malick had nothing to do with this feature, his influence in this movie is everywhere. Days Of Heaven references everywhere. a.) Sam Shepard, 2.) a night wild fire across the horizon, 3.) the fish under the ice2. It's not how long the movie is that's disappointing but how long it takes Pitt to convince us he's Jesse. The train robbery scene is too flippant. Beating up the Ford kid is too... weird. It's the quiet talks he has with his men that finally convince us he's a threat. Once this 'feel' is in the movie I could watch Pitt play Jesse for days.3. INGLORIOUS BASTARDS was a better movie that totally dropped the ball in the last twenty minutes and imploded. JESSE/FORD isn't as good a movie... but it's a better experience because it accomplished what it set out to do and didn't collapse in the slightest.4. Casey Affleck and all the supporting characters are amazing."
5,Great Storytelling,"Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck give Oscar-worthy performances in this excellent piece of storytelling. I don't care too much about the real Jesse James (cold-blooded murderer, and certainly no hero), but I must say that Brad Pitt's portrayal of a conflicted bandit made me a little sympathetic. Casey Affleck's portrayal of the initially enamored, then calculating betrayer, was spot on.I wonder why the director didn't include the fact that Charley and Bob Ford were initially charged with first degree murder, sentenced to hang, and then pardoned by the Missouri Governor. At 2.5 hours, I guess the director decided that the full story could not be told. Although I could have done without the 'squaw' jokes.TWO ENTHUSIASTIC THUMBS UP."
1,Perhaps the most boring movie ever made...,"I have seen many movies about Jesse James and for the most part I enjoyed each one of them even though there were many liberties taken in the storylines. That said, this has to be the most unimaginative waste of money ever put forth on a Jesse James movie by Hollywood. The movie completely lacks in storyline and a majority of the scenes are pointless. This movie, however, truly makes a great movie if you are looking for a cure to insomnia."
2,Very dark,"I found this movie to be very dark and not very entertaining. The acting was good as a whole, but there was little action. I would almost classify this movie as a documentary. Not my cup of tea as westerns go."
1,What A Joke...,"This movie was the most pathetic movie I have ever seen in my life. It gets lost & boring, tells nothing about Jesse James...I found this movie in a budget bin at Walmart...and when I was done watching it, I threw it in the trash. Total garbage. Don't waste your money."
2,Most Disappointing,"This has got to be the most boring Jesse James movie ever made. Even with the likes of Brad Pitt and Sam Shephard, it just doesn't cut it. Pitt is brilliant as ""bad guy"" Jesse James, but his amazing performance is not enough to make this movie worth watching. Shephard is conspicuously absent from most of the movie, which moves so slowly I had to watch in three sittings. I confess I would have scrapped it entirely after the first attempt if I hadn't recently canceled my satellite tv service. If you pay $18 for this movie, you will most likely be disappointed, too."
1,boring as Hell,Absolutely terrible picture. Who needs more introspective analysis that is actually not based on historical fact?
3,Disappointed,"I was expecting a more action, thrilling ride. Left me very unsatisfied, from expectations. While Brad Pitt is exceptional, it really drags on and nothing to keep it going, very dry. It is a interesting story, but I'd rather read it."
2,"Beautiful cinematography, but too long and too slow","The movie looks great on Blu-ray, but it is far too long and far too slow at getting to the meat of the matter.I can't say the first 2 hours (give or take) of the movie isn't needed. A fair amount might be required to help give background on the events that led up to the meeting of the players involved, their motivations and interests and such, but sadly those initial 2 hours seemed to drag on and on without purpose or possible direction.The movie gets better in the last 30 - 40 minutes, but by then you may have fallen asleep and decided it's just not worth sitting through."
2,Torture to sit through. Terrible.,"While Brad Pitt was an inspired choice to play Jesse James, and does a great job, and while the sets, scenery, acting and cinematography were all wonderful, I'm with the reviewers who thought this movie was an interminable, unbearable bore. One might ask how it's possible to ruin a movie about Jesse James, and the answer would be to let Ridley Scott anywhere near it and shoot the movie as a 2 hour and 40 minute post-modern lecture on media celebrity, masculinity, obsession and self-esteem, all focused not on Jesse James but on the weasely Robert Ford. Come on people- just because a movie is long and boring doesn't mean it's a work of genius!"
2,David McCullough imitation by narrator very creepy,"This movie would have been much, much better, had the filmmakers not opted for a narration that was obviously intended to sound (exactly) like David McCullough narrating a historical documentary. The effect was eerie, as the narrator nearly succeeded in sounding like McCullough himself, yet was obviously not the historian. Rather than enhancing the experience, this imitation was very annoying and distracting."
2,Shot in the Back Again!,"Two stars for excellent cinematography and fairly good acting. However, that's it. From there on, the two and half hour story-line is drab and slow - a story that could have been told in less that 30 minutes!Also, unless the viewer is totally immersed in the fable of Jesse James, chances are you will get lost within the first 15 minutes. Too many characters who are not well defined, much less introduced. No background. The mumbling dialogue leaves much to be desired.Sorry I wasted about $3.00 renting it. It is certainly not worth buying, unless you suffer from insomnia, in which case it will put you to sleep!"
4,Entertaining,"I'm surprised that I actually liked this movie. I thought the cinematography was great, Brad Pitt commanded the scene, and I found it highly suspenseful. IMHO they could have done without the voice over and I can see why the pacing could throw some viewers, but it worked for me."
2,Beautiful scenery..boring film!,"I was pretty bummed out that this movie was so boring. I like the story of Jesse James,and I most definitely like Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. That being said, this movie was boring. I stopped it with about 40 minutes left. I know this review isn't very helpful...I just expected a lot more to the story."
2,Too much storytelling,"I recently rented this movie thinking I was going to see a little suspense and western culture, instead what I got was sleepy. The movie moves too slowly to keep any interest and the constant narrative does not help almost each scene is narrated which takes away any of the suspense between Ford and James. If the director knew how to make a captivating movie, he would have cut out all that narrative and instead told a story through actions, not through words. Casey Affleck's performance as Robert Ford is very good but it is not enough to save this movie from being pretty boring."
2,Sloooow Movie,"Great cinematography, some of the best I've seen, however, the camera work is the movie's shining feature. The rest of the movie is extremely slow paced and almost boring."
2,Great Actors. Boring Movie!,"This movie was so boring!! The actors in this movie do the best with what they have. It took me 3 tries before i actually got to sit down and watch the entire movie. Mostly, because i kept getting bored and cutting it off. Brad Pitt carries this movie most of the way but it's entirely to slow paced. This is not a movie, this is actually a documentary pretending to be a movie. They should have made a documentary about the Life and Death of Jesse James. Brad Pitt could have even narrated. That's basically all this is anyway."
2,"Boring, Boring, Boring...",I always enjoyed the stories of Jesse James until I watched this movie. Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck are great actor and it is too bad they wasted their time with this movie. I was bored too tears.
4,I agree that this is an excellent movie,"The couple of reviews I read on Amazon.com were most eloquent. I was enticed by them to buy the movie, which I did. I have always enjoyed Pitt but never liked Afleck; thought Rockwell was OK. After seeing the moving I couldn't add anything to the reviews except to say they were right on. The scenery was beautiful, especially when a snowed upon field from a distance was blurred on the edges. Most interesting. I felt embarrassed for ole Bob Ford since he was trying so hard to A-K. As the movie went on I realized just how good he and Rockwell were in their roles. Brad Pitt was of course quite excellent and portrayed someone who was going a little batty, I thought. The first scenario at the railroad tracks was by far quite the best.All in all, I'm glad I read the reviews of others, quite well done and I have a new insight into old Afleck - so much so that I bought ""Gone Baby Gone"" just to see if he was as good as I thought."
5,"Not For The Shallow, ADD, or Intellectually Challenged","This is a very slow paced, darkly moody story that requires intellect, intuition, and depth of understanding to comprehend the subjective ""actions"" of the characters.I am not surprised that many reviewers of this movie do not have the requisite abilities to appreciate and admire this subtle masterpiece. I bumped my actual 4.7 Stars rating to help compensate for the many sub-standard reviews by people who are obviously not capable of absorbing and appreciating this notable example of cinematic fine art.I would poke the clueless reviewers more harshly, but they still wouldn't get it and probably deserve my pity instead.The movie is a brilliant work, but you don't have to be certifiably brilliant to thoroughly enjoy it - although an above average sophistication, intelligence and maturity is probably required to achieve a 41/2-5 Star viewing experience.Snobbishly Yours,EdB"
5,One of my all time favorite films.,"The acting in this film is superb, the narration beautiful and the cinema photography stunning. There are many great character actors in this film."
1,"Really long, really boring","If you want to see a good movie with casey affleck, try ""gone baby gone"". This is a very strange boring movie that never seems to end. There is not much that is artful. I think a whole bunch of people just kept telling each other how good this was and then they made it and not one person said ""You know, this is a pretty boring movie"". It was too bad all that money and talent was wasted on this."
1,Just too boring,"When I watch a Western I want to see amazing quickdraw gun fights and this movie really lacked action,but we did see several guys get shot in the back which was lame.I recommend a rent only because I think you will regret buying this movie..."
2,Not the best,"Someone picked this for our book club selection of the month. I would not recommend it. Most Midwesterners do not obsess so much about the changes in the weather, or at least anyone I've ever known. An overwhelming use of adjectives at every turn made me want to start counting them after the first chapter. It all could have been shared in an essay."
3,So-so,"The DVD was mildly funny. The content was clean, but it was simply amusing. I expected to laugh but just smiled and chuckled a few times."
4,Yeaaaasssss Yeaasssss Beloved,Joe Clair is stupid..... this is a pretty good dvd that most of the family can watch and get a good laff out of. Joe is the MC and opens with his own stuff and I would have to say is the funniest one here. His impression of Bobby Jones had me giggling for a couple of days..... worth getting.
1,Worked for about 10 months,I bought this iron last July and found that it worked quite well. However I've used it about twice a month since then (20 times total). It started leaking a lot of water a couple months ago and went dead tonight. I'll give it a final try tomorrow but right now I have to rate this iron as another imported piece of junk.
5,Fantastic film!,"i'll be frank, I rented it from Hollywood video, and I have to say it was the best film I'd rented to date. ^_^fantastic martial arts, fantastic story line, okay maybe not fantastic story line, it is however a typical action flick, with a grain of salt and no real expectations, this film will entertain as well as surprise you, it is a fantastic film."
1,Murphy,I purchased the affinity crossfires about 3 weeks ago and have used them twice. The head of the 5 wood flew off while I teed off on the second hole. I'm not impressed with the quality. The clubs also do not look anyhting like the picture. The clubs are a black and ugly orange color. I'm sending them back.
1,The Selfish Giant,This rendition is fine for little children.A truly superb reading was done on LP by Basil Rathbone. If this could be found and transferred to CD perhaps with animation it would become a cherished gift for the world to share. The recording also includes the Happy Prince and The Nightingale and the Rose. Hear it once and you are hooked.

Carothers' accounts are written in a fast paced style and by the time you finish the book you'll be equipped with a simple but stunning key to life."
3,Poor quality photos,"A thorough and focused academic treatise on Cosmati tiling. Living in Rome I was interested in the designs, so I bought this book when it was newly published because it's the only one on the subject. Unfortunately, many of the color photos (taken by the author while a student) have a yellow cast are so dark you can hardly see the details; a few are even out of focus. Such a shame after so much effort of research and expense of printing, that a professional photographer/photo editor was not used. For my purposes I found it disappointing, especially at the list price."
5,"Fast shipment, right product!","The price on this item was by far the best available. It was shipped immediately (within 24 hours), was well packaged and arrived in good order. it is supposed to have a service life of 3000 hours so I won't know for sure for at least two years but so far so good!"
1,I was hoping for a science resource...,"If you are looking for a resource to teach about bears, this isn't it. There are some activity ideas in this book, but they won't help you teach your students about actual bears. There are some things about Pooh Bear and Smoky the Bear, but unfortunately for me, the information on actual bears is limited to a brief summary in the introduction. I guess I should have known when I read ""integrated unit of study"". I suspected the science section of the unit might be slim, but I was surprised to find that it was actually non-existant."
2,Not very good.,"The hat is made of felt and flops over, no way to keep it straight like in the picture, if that is important, look else where."
4,Lincoln Hat and Beard for 10-yr old Speech,"My son has not presented the Gettysburg address yet with this Lincoln hat and beard, but has tried it on and practiced with it. So far, it meets expectations. We did not want to spend too much money on this, so our expectations were in line with the cost. It is true that you have to stuff the hat or it will fall over. It is flimsy; does not stand up on its own. The beard is too big for my son's face, but again, we knew it was not necessarily a child's size. We will have to make some adjustments, but so far, I think it will serve our purpose."
3,Good for a cheap costume...,"Not the best quality but for the price I can't complain. Had to make some minor adjustments, but overall I am happy with the purchase."
3,Product is ok,"Very glad that the seller included the inflated product packaging as I am using it to stuff the hat to get in into the correct shape as the hat arrives squashed flat. I am hoping that I can get the creases out of the felt in order to make this usable for the show in July. I guess the old saying ""You get what you pay for"" is true. I wasn't looking for a hat that could be worn daily, but I was looking for one that could be worn at least once to portray our President!"
3,Lincoln hat,"Bought this for my 17 year old son to use at a Halloween party. The hat fit well and didn't any support to keep it's shape but the beard was quite ""skraggly"" and fit well below his chin. We had to buy fake eyelash adhesive to try to keep it attached to his chin. The effect was OK but was messy. Overall, the product was pretty much as expected."
1,Hate this bra!,I hate this bra. The elastic band is NOT soft and rolls up as the day wears on. Shoulder straps are skinny & inadequate. Only good thing is that it is low-cut. I prefer my $12 nursing bras purchased at Wal-Mart. I only wear this one if those are unavailable or my shirt is low-cut.
3,runs small,"I am usually a 42 d-dd, so I bought the xxl, which is supposed to go to 46. This bra fits me well now (I am 9 m pregnant) but worry that when my milk comes in, it may be too tight. For that reason I can only give 3 stars.I will say that it is very comfortable, but make sure you buy a larger size."
1,"More fiction than true crime,the author's fantasy of events.","As someone who was a friend of a victim, the book's tired portrayal of all rural residents as ""hicks"" does a disservice to the many compassionate law enforcement, professional and even media people who went out of their way to comfort and support the survivors. The damage done by this portrayal remains long after the trials and sentences which could have brought closure to the community."
1,Will NEVER read....,"Being transgendered myself i would NEVER pick this book up. Even if i weren't, i wouldn't. Just reading the summary has me ticked off and insulted - the author obviously didn't do an OUNCE of research on the topic of transgenders/transsexuals... or even on Brandon himself. Brandon was transgender - he was a male in all but body, and was trying to present as such.By not recognizing this, the author is no better than the people who shot him point blank OR Brandon's family (who buried him as a ""her"" with female descriptions.) Makes me sick to my stomach..... I was looking for an ACCURATE account....."
3,What's for sale here?,"The book was pretty good, had alot of background info which I find more interesting than the trial info.It did seem to me though that the author sympathized more with Lana that Teena's mom, JoAnn. She commented on how ""pretty"" Lana looked on the Maury Povitch show, and that JoAnn didn't attend the show because she ""felt like she had bigger fish to fry."" And she also seemed to make a litttle dig about how neither JoAnn nor Tammy went to Falls City to get Teena when she was calling and telling them what happened.HOWEVER...my main issue with this book, and maybe I am being a little petty here, is that in the back of the book where it shows the author's photo it looks as though she doesn't have a top on. I know it doesn't show much skin but come on was this really necessary? It made me wonder what was for sale, the book or the author herself?"
4,a quick and easy read,"If you are looking for an unbiased presentation of the facts involving the murder of Brandon Teena, Lisa Lambert , and Phillip Devine, this is a book you won't be able to put down. If you are searching for a literary work of art, you may want to keep searching. Despite the typos and grammatical errors, I thought the book was easy to read and understand. I would recommend this book to all true crime buffs."
2,Interesting story but told with a lack of insight and skill,Jones has riveting material to work with but she shows little insight into what motivates any of the people she writes about. She trots out the usual cliches about unhappy childhoods and sexual abuse but she does not persuade the reader that these events shaped her characters in any particular way.The banality of her prose and the remarkable number of typos added to my disappointment with this book. Did no one edit this book?
2,All She Wanted,"The author's spelling inconsistencies are enough to make you want throw this book out the window! If you like sentence fragments, then this is your book. I did, however, find it very interesting to learn about how deceptive Teena Brandon really was. Boys Don't Cry touches the surface of her deceit, but this book does provide much detailed information about her criminal history and various relationships."
4,Thought provoking,"This book really sparked my curiosity. I peeled through the book, waiting to see what the sequence of events was going to be. Yes, the ending was no suprise. But, it left me yearning to find out more and more about Teena Brandon and the people who were in her life. It was a tragic story."
3,What a sad story.,I read this book and it made me want to cry. I have no patience for senseless killing. This true story broke my heart.
3,Glad The Movie Came Out!,"I read this book about 3 years ago. It was very good of course but as others have said, I had MANY unanswered questions when I closed this book. It did get very boring from time to time. I was glad the movie came out because then the media ate this story up and really came out with all the stuff that happened. You finally got to find out what really happened to the two jerks and I'm glad to know what they got. Aphrodite does a great job in her research most of the time and I was happy to read ANOTHER one of her great books... this was my 4th."
5,"""Boys Don't Cry""","I can't believe they made such a great movie from this book! I love to read all of Aphrodite Jones' books. If you want to watch the movie, you should definitely read this book, too."
1,Mediocre and Unskilled Writing,"Aphrodite Jones relates Brandon's story in an extrordinarily trite and amateurish manner. This book sorely needs both copyediting and proofreading. Jones includes too many dull details of peripheral characters and events that do not propel the story forward. Also, there is an appalling number of spelling and grammatical errors. A reader should expect that the purchase price of a book includes the publisher having made the book readable and free of silly errors. The life and untimely death of Brandon Teena are fodder for a fascinating study of human nature. It's unfortunate that Jones did not exhibit any depth or insight whatsoever. This book is a huge disappointment on many levels."
3,"Interesting story, serviceable rendering","I thought this was an interesting story, since the subject is defenitely different from your average true crime offering. I'd say the book is one of those mass market sensationialistic types, adequately written insofar as it's easy to read, keeps your interest, and moves along quickly. But, in keeping with this genre, it unfortunately lacks depth. It pretty much reports the facts, without delving significantly into the characters' psyches or motivations. In fact, by the end of the book I had very little sense of who Teena Brandon was; the apparent contradictions in her character of being sensitive and caring to lovers vs. being self-serving, irresponsible, and unethical to everyone else (including society) went unexplained and unilluminated. I would have liked to understand her more, since the real point of this book is not so much the crime of her death (which is not very complicated and is swiftly accounted for) but rather the strangeness of her life."
4,A must read!,This book was excellent. I was looking forward to learning more about Teena and this book gave a lot of insight into her life and final days.
2,IT IS NOT TRUE,I know that the murder was true but the people that they arrested were not true. Tom is one of them who did but John Lotter did not. If the author would have told you the first word after Tom was arrested she would have told that Tom said Lanna was with him. Then later changed his story. I think if you are going to write a book you should find out the truth first. Yes John was arrested by he is now appealing it. Because of the first words out of Tom's mouth......
4,Good Lil Goal for Lil Games!,"Purchased 2 of these goals for small soccer game. Goals are pretty light weight and functional. Goal can be fold in half, wish it can be folded even more so we can throw it in the smaller car or SUV rather than a truck."
4,nice,nice product nets are not as good as the goal itself but still is very fun to use and nice size too
5,Good Toning Workout,"I'm already bias towards Gin. I think she is an excellent instructor and I have almost all her videos, even the Reebok series. This video makes for a very good toning workout. I was definately sore the next day using only ""medium"" weights (5 lbs and 8 lbs). This workout allows room for growth by letting you chose the weights you're most comfortable using. There's not a bunch a jumping around and swinging the weights. Gin takes her time and lets you feel more of ""the burn"". There is some over explaining but if you're a long-time home video exerciser, you can proceed working-out while Gin is explaining. It wasn't a big distraction for me. This is comparable to Cathe or Jari Love."
5,Great presentation!,I was pleasantly surprised with the packaging and the content of this product. It looks very expensive and is selling for a very reasonable price. Highly recommend it.
2,OKAY,"I first read Captain Haggerty and CArol Benjamin's Dog Tricks TeachingYour Dog to be Useful, Fun and Entertaining and I then found this book which I did not think was as comprehensive as the Haggerty book, although it was a nice little book. In fact, I felt like with some tricks in this book they were coming straight from Haggety's book. The Haggerty book has a LOT more tricks too and are easier to follow. That is a classic."
2,Meh,"Somewhat useful. I find many of these dog trick books to be virtually identical. This one was no different. It roughly works, but not all that engaging and limited in what it teaches, which is fine I guess, since we're talking about dogs. If you try to teach your dog the encyclopedia, you probably need some training of your own."
5,The Last Days of Heine,"This is an absolutely great book and essential reading for anyone who loves Heinrich Heine--or would like to get to know who this legendary poet and wit really was. Above all, Pawel's wonderful work demonstrates all the ways in which the great man's spirit managed to overcome the terrible adversities with which he was forced to live."
1,Lack of info,Was unpleasantly surprised when I received this book -- it was the LARGE PRINT edition! This info definitely should have been provided.
1,BAD PRODUCT,I purchased this as a gift. It did not work. The return policy was 30 days. They will not take it back. I was told to contact the manufacturer. Not satisfactory costumer service.
1,Emerson radio,The radio cd system did not work. I mailed it back to the company over three weeks ago and have had no word from them about a rebate. I won't use them again.Charles Adie
3,Hearty little clock-radio-CD-player,"I have to say I was surprised. I'd owned Emerson video and audio products in the past -- all right, in the mid/late-1980s -- and was not too impressed either by how they sounded or how long they lasted. I really do like this product, though. In tune with lalouisianne's review, the sound isn't anything to write home about, but it isn't lousy either. I wasn't looking for anything with a great radio tuner, so the reviewer who criticised the weakness or non-functionality of this one's didn't faze me in the least. The buzzer alarm is a nice contrast to the brightness (or friendly lack of same) of the LED time screen: it's much louder than that of the GE which this Emerson unit replaced. And that in itself is saying something (so says a fellow who grew up within earshot of GE's ordnance factories in western Massachusetts). And don't be wary of buying one from an affiliate merchant, either. WarehouseDeals are very prompt and courteous folks. That's the lot."
3,works,"There is no indicator on the radio dial so you can tune. The sound itself is not bad for the money. The time is nice, large, and isn't so bright that it keeps one awake."
1,2 out of 2 had to be retuned - junk,"First one arrived and the cd player was locked. Thought it had been jostled in shippig so returned it while ordering a replacement. Second arrived [very quickly thanks to Amazon] and nothing worked other than the clock. Not the sound, not the tuner, not the cd player...nothing. Amazon has great customer service but this item is pure junk. Save you money and buy something else."
1,Disappointed!,"I bought this product this passed Christmas from another store for my elderly father who is in a nursing home. It didn't last 9 months! Very disappointed. He said it worked in the morning and in the afternoon, it just died! No clock, no cd, no radio. We couldn't believe it; so we tried plugging it into different outlets thinking it was the power source. Nope! Crappy Clock Radio!"
4,good clock radio,"This is a great alarm clock. I have owned it for over a year and never had any problems with it. My only complaint is that it is somewhat hard to find a radio station that comes in clear, but it is not really needed with the CD player and buzzer alarm options."
5,Archetypal Template,I would highly recommend this book for any man or woman who is interested in Jungian Archetypal personal development work. The book details the history of each of the quadratic archetypes and how it relates to todays world. It explains the immature versus mature stages of the archetypes development in people. It also details the passive and aggressive behavior of these archetypes as manifest in men in our society today. The book came to me as recommended reading for a New Warrior Training Adventure weekend which I participated in. While it may not be an 'easy read' it does provide ample food for thought for the seekers among us.
3,The book is good but not so easy to understand at first read,I suggest reading it more than once in order to grasp the ideas the book talks about.I gave it three stars because I think that it should have been written in a way which is easier to understand.
2,Seems patronizing and critical,"Moore and Gillette set up archetypes, starkly oversimplified character sketches of one-dimensional people with clearly delineated faults. Then they belittle people who ""behave that way,"" attracting the respect of judgmental readers who love to share criticisms of third parties.Maybe in some ways the faulted behavior can be situationally appropriate. This possibility is never raised. I lost patience with the book after 30 something pages and flipped through the rest of it. The writer enables a critical audience to reinforce essentially irrational negative thoughts about people. Why should anyone be surprised to find the victims of that criticism responding to its irrationality in ways the critic does not want to hear?Some people will disagree with me, but that's because they like to be told they're oppositional."
2,A flawed foundation leads to a flawed conclusion at best.,After finishing the first half of the book (chapters 1-4 out of 8) I decided not to invest any more time in it. For me the bible is not a book of myths as the author repeatedly says. I see it as a book of history--a book of facts recorded for our benefit. The entire first half of the book repeatedly refers to the bible as a book of myths and then draws its conclusions based on that position. The foundation is flawed and so I have very little confidence in the accuracy of the author's conclusions.
5,A concise guide to the male psyche & man/boy archetypes,"Using common terminology and examples from contemporary movies, this book easily leads the reader through the thick, dense forest of archetype psychology as applied to the lives of present day men. Superbly delineating between aspects of boy psychology and their counterparts in mature men, the book also identifies factors critical to male psychic development that are severely at risk in our technology-driven, consumer oriented culture. Much of what the authors present can be extrapolated to girl/woman psychology."
1,Don't buy this,"I thought that buying socks by actual foot size would be great. Boy was I wrong. The feet fit perfectly, the socks only come up past my ankle. On this review questionaire they say ""ankle socks, they didn't say that on the order or the description when I purchased the socks.I thought that "" The Sock Company"" would know how to make socks. Boy was I wrong."
4,Fast delivery!,Item was received quicker than time specified. This was for a birthday present so was happy to get it before his birthday. It was in mint condition. Will problably use seller again. Thanks.
4,Highly entertaining,Season 3 had a few more distractions than the previous seasons- with the departure of Sharona and introduction of Natalie Teeger- but many of the episodes had clever mysteries that were highly entertaining. Monk rocks!
3,Bitty Schram Was the Best,"I bought this DVD, because Bitty Schram still played Sharona in some of the episodes. As far as I'm concerned, Bitty Schram's character was far more entertaining than Monk's. I thought Sharona's conflictual interactions with Monk, as well as her clever assistance in some cases, made all the difference. Now that Bitty Schram has departed, I've lost interest in seeing any more episodes."
5,Still great!!!,"Maybe not as great as the first two seasons, but still on top of my list as one of the best shows ever.I think I'll get over the departure of Sharona."
3,Bring Back My Sharona,"5 stars for the first half of Season 3 (and for Seasons 1,2). Funny, clever, endearing. Monk is a great detective fiction series along the lines of Columbo. The chemistry between Monk and Sharona gave the series a sparkle rarely found on television these days.2 stars for second half of season 3. The character of Sharona was rudely replaced with the character of Natalie. The chemistry is gone and the writing has suffered too. The character of Natalie is annoying and her interaction with Monk is uninteresting."
4,Last But Certainly Not Least,I enjoyed the Third Season of Monk more than the others for the following reasons: 1-This DVD series contains my favorite episodes The Panic Room and the Blackout where Adrian Monk is at his brillant best.2-This contain the last series that has Bitty Scram who I will sorely miss as Sharona Fleming.3- The DVD extras are much better on this one especially when they describe their favorite scenes. If you are a true Monk Fan this is a much-get.
2,Season Three is a Disappointment in Content and Packaging!,"I wholeheartedly concur with the negative sentiments relative to the Natalie Teeger character. Bring back Sharona!!! Besides the disappointing content of season three, the packaging of this DVD set is far inferior to that of the previous two seasons. The picture quality is terrible (so grainy!!!)and the DVDs are individually packaged rather than being part of an attractive and sturdy fold-out case. This set was obviously produced ""on the cheap."" This accounts for the two stars in my review. I would still recommend the set to Monk fans, but with the afore-mentioned qualifications. Shalom and Shalhoub!"
2,SHORT SWEET AND TO THE POINT,TALK ABOUT HAVING THE STARS AND WANTING THE MOON!WHAT A TOTAL AND ABSOLUTE MESS! STICK WITH SEASONS 1 AND 2.IS THIS SEASON THE RESULT OF MURDER OR SUICIDE?
1,Bravo Hit - MONK,"I love this show, Monk. Monk played by Tony Shaloub is just a great actor to play this role. I find this show to be interesting, amusing, funny, some mystery, caring, tenderness and just a great tv show. This is the reason I have all the MONK dvd's that are out for purchase to present date.It is a well written show and so different from other shows on tv at present time. Wonderful show. Look forward to watching it over and over."
1,didn't work,I don't like surveys that tell me how much I have to say - you can guess what my six more required words are.
2,HotSynch cradel was broken. z,The button was frozen so I could not do HotSynchs.It ended up in the trash.
5,Walk Like A man GREATTTTTTTT,I've seen this at least 20 times and it never gets old! And I can watch it with my grandkids! If you like comedies you will LOVE this. It's an old show but worth buying to watch when you need a REALLY good laugh!
3,New? Used!,It was my understanding that this dvd was NEW. The ad stated NEW but when I received it the package said- USED-LIKE NEW. I am not happy about that. Once the dvd is played I will let you know if there was a problem. NEW should mean NEW----NOT LIKE NEW.
4,Walk Like a Man,"This movie is a cute movie, it was not the one I was looking for but it was still good. I received this movie is good shape from the seller and I do appreciate this."
2,Waste of time,"Saw this movie for the first time this week,,, and will be the last. I like Howie, but this was dumb and ridiculous."
4,Truly funny,This movie recieved a turkey in my big video guide book. They are so wrong. This truly a great movie. If you have a sense humor you'll love this.
1,Never got the movie,"Placed order for Walk like a man, got email was not the quality they wanted to sell. Then WHY put it up for sell on Amazon ????"
3,"Nice tunes, but what are they about?","Like many, I bought this primarily to hear the young Enya, and her contributions seem to fit in nicely. The music is well performed, with a good mix of sounds. But ...The liner notes leave a lot to be desired. The essay on the band's history is a good read. But with 6 of the 11 tracks being vocals in Gaelic (and most of the titles in that language), some idea of what the songs are about would have been more useful.And while I recognize this is a reissue of an LP, 36 minutes is short for a CD."
4,Classic Clannad,One of the two Clannad albums on which you can find the voice of Enya. You can hear her as lead vocals on two of the songs. This is one of the classic Clannad albums with the haunting Celtic tunes that Clannad is so famous for. They've somewhat changed their sound to a more mellow tune through the years so if you're interested in their earlier stuff this is the album to buy. Fuaim was produced by Nicky Ryan who went with Enya when she went solo.
4,A Sacred Place,"Bonnie Leon paints the pages of ""A Sacred Place"" with skillful insight. Drawing upon her rich family history, Bonnie's tale is carried upon all the faith-shaking emotional drama of an arranged marriage, the aching suspense of wilderness survival, the physical and spiritual stretching of two lives dependent upon the other, and the eery horror of learning they are less than alone on the island upon which they must remain. A must read, the enduring lessons of this journey will stay with the reader long after the book is shelved."
5,A Sacred Place,"A Sacred Place, by Bonnie Leon, tells of the troubles and hardships two people face on a fox island in Unalga. Being trapped on this deserted island, Sean and Mary learn to trust each other and learn how to live life the hard way. They run into some dangerous mishappenings including almost getting killed by a poacher, near death from the cold, and almost not having enough food for survival. This book deserves a 10 because it not only shows how to survive difficulties in life, but it shows how someone can learn to trust and follow God. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about God and what He has for their life."
5,sacred place,"This is a terrific combination of romance, historical fiction, and survival. As usual, Bonnie Leon makes the place absolutely real. The methods used for survival by Sean and Mary seem logical and compelling, and the tension between them and the poacher is suspenseful. The book is nearly impossible to put down."
4,"Makes my son ""Boogie, Woogie""","My 17 month old son loves to push the button on this toy and dance away! At his young age, he is able to push the button all by himself to make the music start and he spins and bounces to the music! Great Toy!"
2,Doesn't last,"While I found this toy to be really adorable, it was pretty disappointing. My twins received it as a gift at around 12mths. They did enjoy it but it didn't last long and ended up being sold in a garage sale. It does have fun music, but that's about it. You push a button and it sings. There isn't a lot to keep a child occupied. They have MANY toys, so this one was not worth it to me."
2,Not Worth the Read,"I have read several real options books, and this is by far the worst. I would suggest reading Tom Copeland's book if you want a more applied discussion or Lenos Trigeorgis if you want a more theoretical discusison. In fact, Moore (the author) doesn't even really get to real options until ten or so chapters into the book. Theere is too much preliminary stuff that talks about derivatives and financial option strategies, which one does not expect from a real options book. I basically just flipped through the pages and read the interesting paragraphs. I was done in a half hour. Most of the other stuff I already knew from reading other derivatives texts"
5,Great Product,"The product and software works flawlessly. Zero issues in transferring with XP Pro, unlike other people's reviews.Highly recommended for students."
2,Would give 5 stars if not for software trouble,"This recorder works well as a stand alone recorder and nothing else. You CANNOT transfer to a PC so if you're like me and have filled up your device, just put it in a drawer and forget about it and buy a SONY or any other brand that knows anything about USB transfers."
2,Software Stinks!,The voice recorder works fine. It's the software that stinks! I have Windows XP and most of the time my system will not recognize this device. If I disconnect the voice recorder and then plug it back in my PC reboots itself. I've reinstalled the software and it makes no difference. I called Olympus and they were of no help! If so many users have this problem why can't they update their software??? I will never buy anything Olympus again!
2,Digital recorder Olympus VN-960PC,Advertisement with the product said it would work with Vista. Mine does not and I have received very little help from Olympus. I believe the best help I received was over the phone when they said it probably wouldn't work with my HP computer.
4,Just got it.,Just got it - along with the Olympus microphone. Easy to use & a delight!Will use it to voice record during speaking engagements and create a CD compiling each message spoken.. Nice item.
4,Amature Quality,"I was expecting to get a more sensitive mic on this device. I was expecting to be able to pause a recording and continue, instead I get a new recording. I have kept it because I have not found anything quite as compact but the low pick-up on the mic really frustrates me.Perfect for upclose and personal notes, but not for surrounding sounds."
1,Forget transfer to XP computer,"I bought this to always carry with me in case I needed to quickly record some audio snippets for my podcast. Yes, it does fit in a pocket nicely and records good sound with an add-on mic (I didn't care for the built-in mic). However, I've tried to transfer files to two different computers running Windows XP Pro with no luck.Software installs just fine, but no files show up in the folders on the recorder. I know they're there because I can see them on recorder when not connected to PC, and can play them just fine.So this is a nice recorder if you don't want any connectivity. I bought this recorder thinking it'd be as easy to use as plugging it into the USB port and seeing it as a drive. As it is, I can't transfer files off of it so to me, it's a worthless device. Boo, Olympus! Figure out how to work as a true USB device and get with the times."
3,"VN-960pc USB will not work with xp Pro, or home updated from 95","I really like this recorder if I could stop misplacing it and if I could attach it to my PC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I've read about the software and driver issues. YES I've done all the steps. Now for the instructions:There is a NOTE in the instructions. I'm quoting directing from the instruction manual. ""USB support is NOT available under the following environments, even for PCs equipped with a USB port: Windows 98/2000/xp professional, Home Edition upgraded from Windows 95""I'd give it 5 stars if it were advertised with it's lack of compatibility.That says it all."
4,I like this little thing,"This recorder served the same purpose as Sound Recorder on my computer did, only I could take it with me and store a whole bunch of random nonsense. The only thing I would've liked, besides the 'timer' beeping loud enough to wake me out of sound sleep, would be an easier way to access the date-by-date recordings on the fly. If you recorded something on August 9th and it's November 4th, you're gonna be holding the back button on the recorder for a long... long... long time. Other than that I think it's great. And even though it ran away from me on 4 seperate occasions, I was still able to find it again with no love lost"
4,4 stars for the device; 1 star for the software+driver,"This is an excellent recorder. Very impressed with it. It's very sensitive and picks up anything at a distance. Sound quality is quite decent. We use it to record our baby's sounds.The software is pretty useless however, and I had to use a workaround to install the driver."
5,A great recorder.,"I bought this recorder a few years ago. It has been a reliable recorder. Great to have a recorder on hand. You never know when you might need it. Once I used it to record a noise my dryer was making, as it never seemed to make the sound once the apartment maintenance man was around."
1,Won't work with Windows Vista,This was a marvelous voice recorder... until I changed from XP to Vista. The patches issued by Olympus won't work (as you can read on endless web-forums). So think twice before you buy it if you are a Vista user.
4,Great sound!,"The little recorder is great,but I wish there was an easier way to mark ""chapters"" in order to skip ahead to a certain time. Other than that, I love it!"
4,"v.good voice recorder, software not working","its a verygood device as a digital voice recorder, but useless software, in defferent word you willn't be able to transfere your file to your PC, and no support for this problem on thier website. i tried to contact them but no response??!!"
2,"disappointed; no DC-in jack, avg. recording quality, cannot upload from PC","This is the top-of-the-line recorder and I was a little disappointed.Pros:sufficient recording time (havent tested that).Cons:1. I am very surprised that they forgot to add a DC-in jack, which means you must always use AAA batteries even when near a power supply! A DC-input jack is a given on all electronic items!!2. avg. recording quality. Mono recording with some echo when recording lectures.3. One of the adverts clearly said transfer to/from PC. I was surprised to find the manual says otherwise. You cannot upload from PC to recorder. Was it too difficult to implement?"
3,No way from WAVE to DSS,"There is no easy way I know of converting the very large Wave files to DSS, for rapid e-mail transmission. Since I have a lot of files to send regularly, I had to buy another device. Otherwise, I found it to be an easy-to-use dictaphone, with decent sound quality and good pc connection."
2,Refurbished Unit,"I bought a refurbished unit and it arrived in very good conditions like new but it has a short life battery and does not record in a very good quality; also the software is very easy to use but you cannot use the reviewing feature; you just can listen from start and end, but not able to listen to an specific point of the conversation that you have recorded. I also got confused a little bit when I erased some conversation that I recorded in following order: #1, #2, #3 etc...if I erased #1 it will converted into #1, if I erased #2 it will converted into #1...etc"
5,Very good DVR,"I am very satisfied with this DVR. It's easy to use, has very good playback quality, the PC interface is easy to use, and the recording time is good. In my opinion, this is a better buy than the WS 100 (I purchased mine on sale for about for about 60 bucks). The files can be burned to an audio CD for playback in you car or a portable CD player."
2,PLEASE NOTE,Please note that this voice recorder does NOT support speech-recognition software!! This is not indicated in the technical information provided by Amazon. The voice will be saved as WAV file which is NOT able to be converted into a DSS file that is acceptable by a speech-recognition software.
1,Non-Functional,Olympus does not offer Macintosh compatable software for this product. It is worthless if you are a Mac user.
2,Nice little recorder but...,"While the recorder itself is nice, I'm unable to upload the recordings to my Win XP computer. I tried connecting the recorder to the USB port as suggested; I've tried loading the software first. Neither approach works. I keep getting the message ""A service instillation section in the INF is invalid."" Absolutely NO HELP on manufacturer's site.The only reason I bought this was so I could upload recordings. If I just wanted to record, I could have bought a much cheaper recorder."
4,Handy tool,"This product has been a very handy tool - I use it to record and save conversations/interviews, including focus groups. Good sound quality, and easy to save to my computer. Now I just need the time to review and distill the recordings!"
5,"Cost-effective, superb engineering!","We love this little device! It's easy to use, and has astonishingly good vocal quality. Downloads are quick and easy. Perfect! You'll love it!"
1,Bad Software Drivers,My desktop computer and my wife's laptop have fully up-to-date Win XP Home OS's. The software drivers installed on my system OK but would not install on my wife's system. Olympus tried to say it was Win XP's fault. Claimed they knew how to fix the problem but couldn't tell me!? I said tell me or I return the device. They said return it. I did.
4,Effective!!,"Moist of my decanters are old, crystal and family heirlooms. cleaning them safely has always been tough.This great bush combined with the drying rack made the job both effective and safe."
2,Wine Decanter Brush,I am not very happy with this purchase. The material of the woven brush feels like plastic and doesn't really do a great job cleaning the decanters.
4,A Good Product,"I've got a great collection of decanters. However, I made a mistake of not drinking all the port in one long-necked version. Port, if not consumed in a timely manner, builds a residue.Well, this decanter stands 12"" and has a long, narrow neck. This device cleaned it well.However, it's not intuitively obvious how to use it. At first I was a tad frustrated. But then after reading the instructions and pushing it all the way in, it finally curved into a shape that worked.I just wonder if there is another one that is about 5-6"" longer."
5,These Guys Aren't Wimps!,"In an era of widespread cynicism it's good to know that there are still idealists out there. They may not be saints, but they're usually on the good side. And in this fantastic collection of crime stories you won't be bored. Many of these authors have appeared elsewhere, such as Ellery Queen or Hitchcock. But Pronzini & Adrian selected stories that have an edge to them. Like San Francisco in the early days...Worth it to own, because you'll read it again!"
4,The way it was and shall never be again,"Bill Pronzini, along with Jack Adrian, delivers another excellent collection of American prose. The early stories in Hard-Boiled rarely fail to deliver the style of writing that changed fiction -- for the better -- not only in detective/mystery genres but in fictional avenues across the board -- everyone wanted to be the new Hammett and some of them nearly pulled it off. And those who didn't were the better for trying. This is a good read"
2,"great commentary, mediocre stories...","'Hard-Boiled', an anthology of twentieth-century ""hard-boiled"" short stories compiled by Pronzini and Adrian, should have been great. Unfortunately out of the thousands of stories to choose from they picked the dregs from some of the best writers (Ellroy, Goodis, Thompson, ..), and the best from a great many (deservedly) unknown writers. It took me a long time to slog through the dozens of stories contained in this volume.However the only positve aspect of the book are the commentaries before each story, giving a bit of background on each author and their placement in the history of 'hard-boiled' short fiction. Clearly Pronzini/Adrian have done their homework in this regard. But this only made me more frustrated with the all the mediocre stories they amassed.Bottom line: a missed opportunity. Very disappointing."
4,fix for Device failed to start 'Code 10' error,"I also suffered from the ""device failed to start"" error. Fix was simple, I changed the registry settings according to what I found on another forum when I did a search for this error in google and and removed the card drivers in device manager, restarted the computer and allowed XP to reinstall the drivers. External USB drive was recognized and now works fine.I found this page through google by searching so I'm hoping if I ever have this problem again I can find my post again by searching google again like I always do when I have a problem so in essence I'm helping myself ;)"
2,4 month life... lame!,"It worked well for the first four months that I had it. Its size is what got me. It didn't take up too much space next to my laptop. So when it seemed to work well on one computer, I bought it for my other desktop computer. But after 4 months for each hub, they died out. What garbage!"
1,useless crap at it's worst,"This device simply refuses to work with my new IBM R51 under WinXP Pro. After searching the web (o boy, why didn't I do this before) I found out, I'm not the only one who has problems with it. Belkin doesn't mention this problems with one single word.Don't waste your money on this crap!"
1,"If it's shaped like a lemon, then its a Belkin","This really deserves no stars.We got three of these things for the office, and we got two results: Two did not work from the start; the third worked for a while, before it began working erratically. Rather than hang in there, I had to pack them up and trade them in on 3 D-Link hubs. No headaches with them. Yet.Between this and the failure of a slightly older one at home, I am now sworn off any Belkin electronics."
2,an uneven collection,"Of the group of poets that studied under Miller Williams in the 70s, Adamo is my least favorite of the group. There were several good poems in the collection (and I think ""Old Numbers"" and especially ""My Answer"" are among the finest contemporary poems), but I found most of the poems to mediocre or just didn't make any sense."
1,Useless,It did nothing for me at all. I regret spending so much money on this. It is not that I do not recommend this but I don't know maybe it will work for sensitive people.
1,couldn't get past the taste,"I tried this with everything. Sleepy time tea, stevia, soup, using a chaser. I don't know if it's effective, but I couldn't get past the taste or aftertaste - even brushing my teeth. I don't think it's the company's fault - I think I just don't have the taste buds for this. I taste kept me so preoccupied that I have no idea how it helped with sleeping."
4,It works,"Not as powerful as modern synthetic drugs, but gets closer to that if taken in high doses.I don't notice any side effects and it is known this product isn't addictive. So in a sense itis superior to the drugs one can buy only with prescription."
5,Excellent reading,"This book was inspirational and very moving! Read one chapter per night or more! Once you start, you will not be able to put it down! A must read for anyone in today's busy society!!"
3,Mustang GT,"Good plastic kit of the GT. Kit was purchased to build ""Barricade from Transformers. Build should be fairly easy. Overall detail is good, lends to easy build. Good addition to any mustang model collection"
5,Another awesome Meguiar product,"Have a brand new white Ford Mustang. Have found that all Meguiar products are fantastic. This is no exception. After waxing , when I slide my fingers across the finish; It feels like butter. Shines awesomely. Beads up great Easy clean up afterwards."
4,Step aboard,"With so much wind and chop blowing around in the sonic jetstreams, where does one find smooth flying? Flying the friendly skies with Miss Moneypenny of course. From the back to the futuristic title track ""Letter Ahead"" to the take off your shoes and put your feet-up mint Julip smooth ""Summers End"", this album works like magic. ""TribalSonic"" roars across eternity, while ""Dignity"" tells life like it should be, honest and to the point. ""Here We Go Again"" blocks out the sun while ""Private Guy"" takes a tongue-in-cheek biographical approach. ""Pay Up"" harkens back to biblical proportions with a Hollywood twist and ""My Problem With Dope"" embraces a small miracle. Do yourself a favor... grab your headphones,step aboard and let Miss MoneyPenny pilot you to the stars."
3,Did you know that you can gain 6 lbs just by having a shower?,"And funnily enough, you can lose 4 lbs too.For the price, you don't expect a scale to be pound-perfect. You do not, however, expect there to be so much variance between readings on a flat floor with no movement of the scale.We eventually worked out that standing position is everything (which is now obvious to us in retrospect) and if you are not stood in exactly the same position for each reading, your weight will flip-flop.I weighed myself on some commercial equipment, got home and tried to get a like-for-like match. The most sensitive part of our scale is the part where your heels go. Make sure you hit the same spot every time and you're good to go."
3,Ok if your eyesight is good.,This is a good basic scale but hard to read unless you have good distance vision and there isn't any glare.
4,Good for the money,"Solid scale. Very accurate. Needs to be adjusted fairly often, but once it is zeroed out it will give you an accurate reading. I like the markers, they make it easy to track any fluctuations in weight."
3,Disappointed,"Our 1 yr old son has enjoyed this toy, esp. the fish part (which started leaking after 6 months so we can't put water in it anymore). Two of the three animal sounds stopped working soon after we began using the toy. He pulls off the velcro shapes and carry them around the house. It's gotten it's share of use through his first year but he no longer seems interested in it."
3,Not as cool as it looks,"We've had this toy for most of my 15 month old daughters life. The pictures on the package looked fun, but the most fun my daughter has with this toy is running around with the cow, dog and rooster heads. Our water window sprung a leak on the seam before my daughter was even mobile enough to abuse it. We e-mailed the manufacturer and never got a response (although Tiny Love was good responding to other issues). All in all I'd say this wasn't worth the money."
1,A Big Waste of Money,"I was really excited about this toy. I was very forgetful when it came to putting my son on his tummy, so I thought this would be a great toy for him to have some good quality tummy time on. Wrong. He could care less about this toy. The second I'd lay him in front of it he would just roll onto his back. He was five months old when we bought it, and it is just sitting there. He STILL loves his Gymini and he is six months old now. Also, by the third day the aquarium had sprung a leak..which apparently has happened to almost everyone who has bought this thing. Do not purchase this toy, it takes up too much space, and it's a waste of money. Baby could care less about it."
2,Not Interesting for Kiddos,"When we bought this, I liked the versatility it offered. I quickly noticed, however, that it is mostly good for strewing the soft pieces everywhere. There are actually too many pieces to keep up with, and frankly I'm getting sick of stepping on the cow.My 6 mos old likes it for a couple minutes, until he's rolled away from it.My 3 year old thinks it's interesting, but she just ends up taking it apart and the pieces end up all over the place.After a couple days of playing with it I usually put most of it away and keep out only a couple parts to complement our other toys.The water play mat lasted until my 3 year old stepped on it once or twice. Then that was gone."
3,Disappointing,"I thought this toy was going to be so fun. I spent more time trying to get my son interested in this toy then he spent playing with it. I don't know why, from a adult perspective it looks like babies would love it, but this was not the case with my son. I felt like I wasted my money."
3,Wait until they're mobile!,"My son got this as a gift at four months old, and at six months he is just now starting to enjoy it. It's a great idea, and has some wonderful aspects, but a child really has to be able to move well to get at all the features. The water filled ""pool"" is the most entertaining part. My son's half-brother (a three year old) even likes it.I would recommend this toy for a child at least six or seven months old, no younger."
2,"Looks good, but isnt the best.","I thought this toy looked fantastic as I was searching for developmental toys to help in various areas while they grew. The versitility of this one looks great. Well, I liked it more than either one of my children did, as they almost never played with it except for the simple joy of taking it apart and strewing it all over the playroom! The black and white face was good when they are first starting to be attracted to faces but other than that, it just got taken apart and lost its interest, no matter which way i arranged the peices. Infants would do much better with a flat playmat with a mobile suspended above their heads."
4,Can Last From Kid to Kid with Tiny Love Guarantee,"My son soon made the rooster stop making noise by over pressing it. But the manufacturer, Tiny Love, has a long lasting guarantee. All you have to do is contact them via phone or on their website and give them the number of the tag on the piece and they will send you a new one postage paid. This goes for their Gymini's as well -- if one of the toys with a musical chip dies, just contact them and they will send you another one -- promptly I can say from experience. With how Tiny Love stands behind their toys, this is an excellant value. After all I have found it hard to find a lot of toys which encourage tummy time for newborns as greatly as this one does."
2,this toy fizzled and leaked!,"we received this as a gift. it appeared to be a wonderful toy, with lots of different parts, although it took up a lot of space.. well, our 6 month old - 1 year old daughter was never interested in playing with it, except that occasionally she would put the velcro shapes in her mouth. soon after, the water capsule which holds the plastic fish began leaking. i would never recommend or buy this toy for anyone."
3,Dad in Hawaii,"You will obviously have to contemplate your own child's attention span before buying this toy. It keeps him busy for about 5-10 minutes and then he is off. Trust me, you don't need gimmicky toys to encourage your child to crawl and explore. He/She will figure that out just fine."
3,Not much to discover on Discovery Lane,"Our four-month-old daughter received this activity mat for a Christmas present and we were quite excited about it. But it is not as much fun for her as we thought. While she likes the soft animals that bark or moo, I have to press each one pretty hard to elicit the sounds. She can't do it herself and I can't imagine she will be able to when she is 18 months old, which is the upper age limit of this toy. Also, there is a clever fish bowl that I think she would like to look at, but we cannot open it to fill with water as the directions indicate. Overall, the information that comes with this toy is skimpy, although it is in four different languages. We were very disappointed with this toy and I think we might exchange it for another type of activity mat."
2,Not worth the money,"I agree with other reviewers...this toy is just not that interesting to my son. He is only 6 months, so perhaps he will find it more interesting in the future (my 3 year old played with it for a little while). As far as filling the fish tank goes, there is a very small slit on the side of the inside of the valve. You have to hold that small slit open to fill the tank. It is hard to do, but it is possible. But so far this toy is not worth the price. We also have had trouble with the farm animal noises. sometimes they don't work at all, and other times they sound even when no one is playing with the toy!"
2,Not Worth the money,"A friend of ours recommended this toy but we bought it for our 5 month old daughter and she didn't find it very interesting. She would only look at a few of the forms but after a couple of months, she didn't want to have anything to do w/ it. From a parent's perspective, I didn't like it for these reasons: 1. it's very difficult to fill and drain the fish ""tank"". you have to squeeze the opening so hard that my fingers would hurt. also, the plastic started to leak water after about 5 times of use. 2. the chicken stopped croaking after 2 months of use. 3. in the funnel position, it wouldn't hold up, so you could never ""throw"" the ball into it. Only thing I do like about it is that it's easy to wash. Definitely not worth the ... or so."
3,"Its nice, but not that nice!","I bought this for my son off of ebay, because I just couldn't see paying that much for it and I'm glad I did. He liked the mirror and the animals the most. When the ""fish tank"" was filled with water he liked how it felt, but it quickly sprang a leak. If you could velcro it to the floor, it might be better. As soon as he got to be about 3 months he would pick it up and get tangled in it. If you just give your child one part to play with at a time, it'll save you some worry.Its a nice idea, but as far as it growing with your child like they imply...I don't think so. We got more use and more fun out of his activity gym by Kids II, which I did spend the money on and IT WAS WORTH IT. Unless you've just got to have this for your child, I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Fun but not that much,"This toy looks amazingly fun, but when the baby has heard the cow, dog and rooster for a month and when fishes stopped being new thing, it becomes a little boring for her/him. Another thing that bothers me is you can't change batteries to the animals so it could be a toy for other baby brothers after the one you bought the toy for."
2,Not as much fun as it appears!!,"This toy looks like it would be very exciting, but in fact the only things our son's interested in are the animals that connect to it and make the appropriate animal noises when squeezed and the ball. We have put the ""mat"" part away and our son now plays with the accesories that came with it."
1,very disappointed,Santa brought this for my 8 month old son and by the time Christmas morning arrived the puppy no longer made a barking sound. Within 2 weeks the water-filled pouch had sprung a leak. My son enjoys the mirror and the velcro toys but it was definitely not worth the money that Santa spent. Please save your money!
4,A Little More Internet Protection,"This Mac product attempts to add new protection for internet on-line theft, software vulnerabilities, and identity protection (card numbers, SSI numbers, etc). It now (November 2006) supports Apple's Safari browser for phishing protection. The software loads easily, and the interface is quite ""Mac like"". Adding your personal information is easy. There is nil practical reduction (I find nil reduction) in computer speed, as has been suggested in some of the other software review sites, by people, I might add, who apparently have not tried the product. While the product cannot provide complete protection from internet security problems, it will provide an additional layer of protection which is helpful. Recommended."
2,From Back Cover,"YOUTHFUL INFATUATION COULDN'T COMPARE TO THISIf only Cliff Hamilton had opened his eyes ten years ago! In high school Sarah Melton had been crazy about this warm, sensitive guy, though she'd hidden her feelings. She and Cliff had been fellow history buffs, that was all. But even chaste hugs and kisses would have been better than nothing.Now, ten years later, Cliff saw ""Marvelous Melton"" very clearly as an exciting and damned independent woman. And hugs and kisses weren't enough for him. He had to convince Sarah that he was the man for her..."
3,not the same as Gacinia 1000,This garcinia Plus gives you alot of energy. Not like the Garcinia 1000. I myself do not need the energy. I perfer the 1000 version. The energy is closely related to have 1 energy drink every 3 hours. Not very fun. Do not take more than 1 per day or you will most like no be able to sleep. I made the mistake and ordered this and thought why not it just has more Garcinia and a little extra stuff. No not that at all. It might not react the same for everyone. But who really knows.
3,Natural Garcinia Plus,"This came in super fast, but to be fair, I haven't taken any yet. Only because of a couple ingredient's, the L-phenlalanine and extra sodium."
4,my husband loved it!,"My husband wanted a silicone muffin tray for christmas and loved this one. It's great because the sleigh keeps the mix steady instead of spilling all over the place. It's more expensive than the ones without the sleigh, but I think its worth it. Nice job, no messy clean up!"
2,What was I thinking when I bought this?,"I guess I thought that I could eliminate cupcake or muffin papers and that the flexible nature of the silicone pan would aid in easy removal.. Not so. My cupcakes stuck and broke apart when I tried to remove them, even though I sprayed them with cooking spray first.I have looked at the new silicone bakeware products for a while and assumed that something new would be an improvement. No so, in my opinion. The cupcakes didn't brown as they do in metal pans. This goes out in my next yardsale."
1,not happy,"I found that the finished muffins clung to the tray (I didn't grease and flour, but still). They also were unusually short and stumpy muffins. Better R&D next time, Kitchen Aid."
1,Stick with metal pans!,"I'm so glad I bought this used for $2 vs. new. It looks cool, and the Kitchenaid brand was a plus. Muffins and cupcakes don't brown like they should. The texture and crumb are different. The pan doesn't effect taste luckily. Storage is a problem. Using non-stick sprays leaves a sticky finish to the muffin pan eventually that does not come off in the dishwasher - which would also happen with some metal cupcake or cake pans as well. I do not recommend this at all. If anyone wants to pay shipping, they can have my pan! I'll stick to metal pans."
3,Makes Mangled but Mouthwatering Muffins,"This non-stick pan is definitely not non-stick. I sprayed the pan and my muffins still stuck. With the same treatment in my non-stick metal pan the muffins come right out.I also experienced the unpleasant oder of burning plastic others have experienced.On the plus side, I seem to always scorch muffins baked in the metal pan, and the muffins in the silicone pan are usually baked just right."
5,Mountians and harsh terrian,I have a set of 12 and i use them when we go hiking in Australia with my friends. We have got the radios wet and dropped them onto rocks but they still work like new. I could get 13km out of them on SIMPLEX!!!
1,Poor in any context,"I occasionally write a review of a movie so poorly done simply to save people time and money. I rented this ""new"" because the movie I wanted was out and the previews and cover looked good - i.e. I like Sutherland and Slater. This was a dog of a movie even in the ""straight to video"" group, which are usually badly done yet sometimes mildly entertaining. This story was poorly written and by example, it hurts nothing to know that the psychologist (or whatever) role was so scattered as to make no sense; and Sutherland was in it a total of five minutes. There were at least three, perhaps four extended belly-dancing scenes and another ""musical"" scene where Slater played the guitar while the woman sang. Without those this would have just been a horrible hour-long movie. As it stands, it's an 88 minute insult to the viewers intelligence and a disgrace to the actors that lent their names to this trash."
3,Assassin's Bullet,"Believe it or not, I haven't viewed product yet, that's why I rated as I did andwith that being said."
1,I can't believe I watched the whole thing,"I don't know why others gave this movie such bad reviews. I thought it was great. But, then again, I'm blind and deaf. If I had to actually watch the acting, or hear the dialog, I'd probably barf like everyone else"
2,A Curmudgeon Review,"Hi friends. I normally review mostly zombie movies,so you know I can sit through some tripe on disk.This movie was just O.K.Slater's last good movie was Broken Arrow, including thisone. I want to say, I figured it out in about 30 minutes.If you want to watch it, go ahead. I will not spoil the ending.It was all predictable. If you want to do something, liketalk on the phone or wash the dog--while watching it, itmight just surprise you at the end.Greg K."
5,ACTION PACKED,I LOVE THIS ACTON PACKED SUSPENSE MOVIE. GREAT ACTORS INCLUDING THE LEGENDARY DONALD SUTHERLAND!HE SHOULD DO MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS
1,Terribly Boring,This was a complete waste of money! It was terribly confusing and boring. The video quality was not what I expect for Blu-ray.
5,"Good fit for my x-large, 7 3/4, head; very easy to use; light","Despite its low cost, this helmet has proved to be nearly ideal. I have an unusually large head (hat size 7 3/4), and have found the helmet to be easy to adjust to my head's size and shape, thanks to the quick release adjustment straps. It is also much more light and comfortable than the pot-style Bell I had used for the preceding 20 years. I recommend this helmet unreservedly."
3,Don't know what to think,"I bought these shoes when recovering from ankle surgery. They were a miracle! The support was wonderful, and wearing them brought the only pain-free walking I had had since my surgery. They were comfortable everywhere from top-to-bottom, and I loved the look, too. However, after about 2 months, the shoes began to rub very painful calluses on the bottoms of my feet, on the fleshy part just below the toes. I actually limp if I walk too much while wearing these. I am guessing that the somewhat elevated heels put too much pressure on the underside of the foot. But they still support my ankle. And they cost too much to throw out..."
5,Great quality,"This is of excellent quality. Bought this to go with the Danze Plymouth double towel rack and our Dell Lahara faucets. All have a simple, clean design and go nicely together."
3,Pretty nice,this hat fits just about all sizes and is great. if your about 11-16 this would be a pretty good hat for you.
2,No exactly to the photo,"Is a Toy, no is a Hat, The quality is very poor.Is a home manufacture.I am very decepcionated.Is very bad."
4,No Problems with it !!,"This is a quality, safe storage unit. It is also lockable, so erasing your data by mistake is a thing of the past."
2,pH scale too CHOPPY,"The pH scale on these test strips is too choppy -- the scale only has colors for 6.4, 6.8, 7.2, 7.6 and 8.4. The ideal for a spa is 7.5 with an optimal range of 7.2 to 7.8. Basically this test strip gives you just 2 colors to check water values. Needs to be improved for a smaller scale in 0.1 increments between 7 and 8. Otherwise, works as advertised and confirms another test kit we use as our go to measurement tool (it uses titration of a solution to more accurately determine pH and has an interval of 0.2 between 6 and a bit under 9.)"
4,works but hard to read,"this product has the code to read on the side of the bottle, but they show a hand holding it one way, and that is not the way to hold the strip. I am a dummy at reading my chemicals so I would like the strip to look just like the diagram. I read the first few very wrong. now that I know to do the opposite, I get a good reading."
4,Good,The test strips do what they are intended to do and meet my needs. The directions are clear and easy to follow.
4,Work fine,"They work as advertised, as far as I can tell. I like the bottle's attached lid, and the color scales are right on the bottle."
5,Great,"Good product for the price. Super easy to use, and super convenient. Perfect for the home spa user, and I would highly recommend."
5,Leisure Time test strips are great.,"These worked the same as the more expensive brands, they worked great and cost less! What more can I say. Buy them."
2,I have ordered this product before...,We have always bought these Test Strips for our hot tub. Imagine my disappointment when I finally opened the package today and found that the bottom says 'bromine'. NOTHING in the description stated this and I clicked on the strips in my Amazon History that I purchased in November 2011 for 45010 Chlorine Test Strips. They may work the same but the color chart is harder to read than the original ones. Disappointed. Not sure where we went wrong this time.
5,A Really Great Toy!,"My daughter used the Gymini Activity Gym starting around three months old and came to have hours of enjoyment from it. In the beginning, she would simply look at the hanging objects but soon she was swating, pulling, and kicking different objects around. The black, white, and red design made it easy for her to see the objects. We used it until she was about 7 months old and was confidently sitting on her own. It's still in excellent condition so we have put it away so when we have another baby, he or she can enjoy it too."
5,My daughter loved this from day one!,"This was the only reason I could get anything done once we got home. My daughter always wanted to be held, but once you would lay her under here (especially the mirror), she was mesmerized. I highly recommend buying the extra set of toys also! Even though she's older now and doesn't play with it as much - she still loves to take all of the toys with her and play with them alone!!!"
5,best 'toy' for infants,"I got this when my son was 1 month old and he was immediately fascinated. As he grew, I spent a lot of time on the floor with him, inside the arch, playing with the dangling toys. He learned to bat, grasp, pull and roll, all on this mat. He learned to pull himself over and then up using the bars. The best part is that the gymini snaps apart for easy washing and for taking with us when we traveled; he always had his favorite toy with him and I didn't have to worry about putting him down on someone else's possibly dirty floor! Plus, the rings attached to his car seat and stroller for hours more self-entertainment."
4,Great gift idea for new moms!,"I got this toy as a shower gift for my first child; she's now 2 years old. We just had a new baby a few weeks ago and got this toy back out. The entire toy fits into the washing machine if you bend it corretly and squeeze it in there, and it bounces right back into perfect shape!This toy is 100% portable and very durable. It's brightly colored and enjoyable for infants as young as a few weeks, as the hanging toys an be moved so that they're closer to the ground. I highly recommend this toy."
3,In clearance at some Babies R Us stores,"I registered for a different version of this, but didn't get one at my shower. I ended up going to Babie R Us, and happened to see this in the clearance section of the store. They had several of the priced at $19.90. If you are thinking of getting this, don't buy the one here for over $100. Check to see if your nerby Babies R Us store has some left in the clearance section."
3,Take it or Leave it,I registered for this item and received it. It engages my 2.5 month old for about 10-15 mins. I had to hang infantino toys on it that were made for her carseat to make it more interesting to her. I wish the mat was a little more cushy so that I didnt need to put a blanket under it on my hardwood floors. Overall... I could take it or leave it. I am now researching a new mat that will engage her more.
5,Fun for the baby and for me,"My baby started enjoying his gymini when he was about a month and a half old. He has so much fun in there! I sit next to him while he bats at the toys, grabs them, or just looks at them. I climbed in under there with him one day just to see what he was looking at, which he thought was hilarious. Great fun."
5,Many hours of happy play!!,"This has been one of the best toys that I have for my baby. The variety of toys and bright colors kept her attention starting when she was a month old. Now she is 4 months and loves to roll around on the mat, grab the toys and kick the polls. This is well worth the price! Also it has snaps so that you can fold it in half to store it flat. This was a great thing for travel, because it doesn't take up a lot of space in a suit case. (I also have the Carter's butterfly play mat and due to the pillow on it, it doesn't fold up well.)"
5,A Captivating Toy!,"Our 3 month old son loves ""working out"" in this gym. When he starts to get a little fussy, we lay him down in the gym and it instantly gets his attention. The musical attachment plays ""Its a Small World"" and he loves it (even after playing it over and over and over!). He also enjoys looking at himself in the mirror attachment. Best of all, the supports and attachments are well padded (unlike other activity gyms we've seen) and this is especially important when he gets excited and the arms start flying and the legs are kickin'. Summary - can't recommend this toy enough"
2,Not for the Active Baby,"My child has never been interested in this color combination, and the toy she enjoyed the most on this gym, the mirror toy, she out grew in 3 weeks. Also the musical toy is hard to operate. She has been turning over since she was 3 months old so by the time she could reach the toys and play with them, 4 months, she prefered to be on her stomach crawling. This mat is too small for her to crawl on. If you have an active baby who doesn't like to be on her back or one who crawls early, get something else like the 1-2-3 Discovery Lane."
5,Great Activity Mat,"My daughter is only 6 weeks old, and loves being on her play mat. She loves the mirror attached to it. I really like how the toys can be removed and others put on, with the holes in the arches. Its great, because either way she lays, stomach or back, she can reach the toys, because the can attach up high or down low."
1,Not for every baby,"I put this on my baby registry because of all the excellent reviews I read about it. Well, my son hated it. As a newborn, he would get fussy every time I put him under the gym. I kept trying over and over as he got older, but he never did get into it. I got on the floor with him and tried to show him his face in the mirror, how to move the rattles, etc. He batted at the toys a couple of times, but was utterly bored after a minute or two. I also have the Sparkling Symphony Gym and he liked that one a lot more- it does have some flaws, but it plays music (which sounds quite good BTW)- and, unlike this product, it grows with the child to convert to a toddler piano later (for about the same price as this product.) Perhaps this toy is not an appropriate choice for a very active baby- I think my son needs more stimulation and more excitement than is provided by just lying underneath some toys and batting at them with his hands."
2,Did not engage my babies.,"I guess some babies love this mat, but mine could not have cared less. The toys that hung from it did not interest them. I hung the Tiny Love Trio of toys from it, too, but they were bored by all of it. I'm glad it was a gift and that I did not pay for it myself, because I got very little use out of it."
2,Ok,"Okay, nothing to write home about. Baby did not stay in it long enough to enjoy it. I think it bored him."
3,Not so hot,Neither of our babies were particularly impressed with this.About 5 - 10 minutes was all they could stand and then they were crying for attention.
5,Very Good item,"i bought this item after my baby shower.... i found after reading some bad reviews, that i had no difficulty setting it up..... i love the colors, and yes i agree it does not come with many toys but i belive they are inexpensive. so i just bought 3 more and now it is complete.... i love this item and would recomend it..."
3,Baby wasn't Interested,"I thought this was something I had to have for baby. Well, he never even liked it. I would spend money on something else. We have it sitting in the closet unused."
3,"Nothing wrong with it, but baby was completely bored with it","There is nothing inherintely wrong with this gym, but my baby didn't like it. He enjoyed it for about a week and then grew bored with it and wouldn't let me put him on it again. It is very thin and I had to fold up a blanket to put underneath when he did use it. It is easily collapsible for ease in putting away and getting back out for play. We have the baby einstein gym and he LOVES that. I suggest going with another gym for longer term play time, esp for the price."
2,not worth it,"My son is now 6 months and used this all of maybe 2 weeks. My friend had the Gymini Super Deluxe Light and Music and while over there one day we put him on it and he loved it! They grow out of the blk and white quickly and need color. He's never even liked the hanging toys that come with this even hanging from the Super Deluxe, which we tried. He never paid them any attention. He's still playing on the Super Deluxe once in a while. This one has nothing for them to play with once they get good on their tummy either. Spend the extra money and get something that will interest your baby for 6-8 months."
5,Thank You Tiny Love!!!,"I Love this toy. My 2 year old played with it when she was a baby and now our 3 month old loves it too. This is a geat toy for developing hand/ eye coordination and so much fun for baby to kick. Both of my girls loved it so much, I would recommend it to any mom who wants to have a minute for themselves!"
4,"Great gym, but extra toys are a little expensive",I received this when my daughter was 7 weeks old and she's been using it for a week now. She loves it! The bold colors seem to have caught her attention. I placed the mirror right above her and she would stare at it and happily kick her legs. She can stay there for a good half hour. I can imagine she'll get more use out of the other toys (the musical one and the teether) in the future.The extra toys are a little expensive though.
4,Mom with 3 mth old,"This is a great entertainer for baby. He likes all the colors and can kick at the low hanging rattler. I can see that it will grow with him. You can hang other toys, etc. from the loops on this, to add variety and change it as baby grows.It folds up nice, to tuck away alongside a dresser or wall."
1,boring,"A newborn may enjoy black, white and red, however, ours didn't. This play mat is boring. Our son didn't respond to it at all. We thought maybe he was too young at one month, but when we placed him under the Baby Einstein one, he went crazy with smiles. This play gym doesn't come with many fun toys, and isn't worth the money in my opinion. Save your money on this product and go for the best one...baby einstein!"
2,I am sick to death of black white and RED!,"Okay, I know they're supposed to be stimulating to a newborn, but newborns can't really even see that well at first. When i put my triplets on this, they liked it okay for a while, but after a few months they liked my other playmat, that has jungle animals way more. I get sick of baby gear that is an eyesore, and this is. My kids would stare at the lion and stuff on their mats when they got older, and I like having something more cheerful and not as depressing around.The playgym itself gets 5 stars, I have no problem with the way it works. I just hate black white and red!"
2,hhhmmm... it's OK,"I had a Fisher-Price version on these playmats which I gave 5 stars.http://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-Songs-Smiles-Discovery-Gym/dp/B000OONJBO/ref=cm_cr-mr-titleIt was really great and colorful and came with a heap of hanging toys and a mirrored, music-playing dog.After lending it to a friend and getting it back bent out of shape my hubby bought this one as a last minute xmas gift for our Baby #2. It was the only one in the store he had ducked into. It only has 3 hanging toys. Every other similar playmat has heaps of toys and most have music and lights as well. My main dislike of this one is that the arches are quite low, lower than the Fisher-Price one, so it seems like the toys are right in Baby's face. Other than those deficiencies, the mat is reasonably padded and the material is soft, not silky but soft enough. I would not recommend this to anyone but I do recommend the Fisher-Price one."
5,great entertainment,"I put my little girl in this when she was just 4 weeks old and she was immediately enthralled. Now that she's 8 months and can explore the mat as well as the hanging toys, it's even better. The toys are favorites with or without the mat."
4,baby loves this!,"This is one of my baby's favourite places to play. Since she was a few weeks old she has loved to lay and look at the toys, and the black, white, and red colours really keep her attention. The only thing I would wish were different is that the musical toy would play constantly!! It only lasts a few seconds.I purchased a larger rectangular mirror and tied it to one of the extra plastic loops, and my baby loves to look at herself in the mirror. The mirror provided does not really reflect much. Since it folds flat, we are taking it away with us at the holidays - it will be great entertainment for our baby."
4,Just Right!,"This gym has been a great toy for both our girls. It has bold colors which attract baby's attention and interest. It comes with a mirror, clacking toys and a soft toy that plays music when you squeeze it. (Alas, ours quit working after being stored away for four years.) The pad easily unsnaps and can be washed--unfortunately it faded after one wash. Even so, it's still a great toy because it fulfills it's most important purpose--to keep baby entertained. Wish mine still played music, though."
3,Not for my son,"I got this as a shower gift and tried it every week. He hated it from day one and still gets upset if he sees it anywhere. Don't know why but he wasn't into this toy. It is very durable and very easy to take down and set up and the storage bag is very convenient. He did seem to love the butterfly one at a friends house so maybe the red, white, and black turned him off?"
5,An Incredible toy,I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loved it!!! She plays with it for at least 30mins Which is time that I can get things done. I work 4 days a week and brought this to daycare and she plays with it all the time. I highly recommend this product
3,Great...but cheap,"My 4 month old daughter truly loves the gym, but the snap on top connecting both arches doesn't snap all the way. You go to snap it and you think it's fastened...then my daughter will kick and arch and it will come crashing down. I also agree with one of the other reviewers too. I should have more dangling objects included. It's neat...but definitely cheap."
4,Still using at 8.5 months,"We have been very happy with our Gymini. One optional toy I would highly recommend would be Tiny Love's ""Wind Chimes."" I bought ours at Target. Unfortunately, they come in pastel colors and don't exactly match, but the make a sweet noise and a great kich toy. My son is now 8.5 months old, and while for a few months the Gymini wasn't as much of an interest to him, now that he has gotten over the thrill of rolling away he loves it again, and spends time sitting at the edge and playing with the toys.One dissapointment...after just a few washings (following the manufacturer's instructions) the black has faded considerably."
5,Essential for baby -- and mom,"Endless hours of fascination for our newborn -- and often the only way I get to take a shower. It's hard these days to find toys that aren't battery-operated or totally overstimulating. She never seems to get tired of the handful of toys that came with the Gymini. I know it doesn't have a very long useful life, but at this age, when she can't do much for herself, this is the absolute best hands-free play option available."
5,"EXCELLENT toy for infants, life-saver for fatigued new moms","I don't normally write reviews (5 month old's don't often allow for it!), but I have to let everyone know that this is an excellent product. Admittedly, I purchased mine at a garage sale for much less, but that should speak to its durability...two owners and still going strong! The black/white/red colors are exactly what newborns are attracted to. During the ""hold me round the clock"" stage, it was the only thing that would entertain him while I took a break. Definately worth the investment."
4,Fun toy for infants!,"My daughter started using her Gymboree when she was about 2 months old. She loved to lie on it & look up at the bright colors. As she got older, she could kick & grab the attachments. It makes NO NOISE, which is great. It can easily be folded & stowed away, or brought along to friends' homes. I highly recommend this toy!"
5,Good enough to pass down!,"I had this Gymini from my first son 6 years ago. We would take it on outings to other people's houses to keep him entertained. My daughter also used it for a while. It came with us in our house move. I just pulled it out for my newborn son. I washed and dried the mat with no problem and surface washed the poles and got out any stains on them. It still looks just as good and my 7 week old son is starting to use it and hit the dangling toys. I bought extra links and toys for it to keep it interesting. Pass it down to your other kids, or your friend's kids!"
4,A Terriffic Stimulator!!!!,"I did not have this with my first child six years ago, but my 4 1/2 month old daughter loves it. I can feed her and put her down to do housework and she is entertained for a little while. I would recommened this for anybody that has a new born. It will last for some time."
2,Not too great.,"My daughter wasn't really interested in this toy. She's nine months, and she still ignores it. I think she only enjoyed it for two or three days when she was five months old. The individual toys are great, though. Just buy the toys and forget the mat. You can also hang them on your bouncer."
5,First Favorite Toy,"This was my son's favorite toy as an infant. It was the only thing that entertained him, besides mommy and daddy, during his first three months. It went with us everywhere.He really liked the hanging toy with mirror."
3,"A Lot of Money, for a VERY Short Amount of Play Value","I got this as a gift, because everyone said ya had to have it. It is ok, and it is a good toy for an infant, but the value runs out in a hurry! The links are great (they can be bought seperately) and the toys - average. The mat itself really is only any good until babies can roll. And the dome is not high enough to be much interest when they can sit up. The links are great, for carseat, stroller, and random use, but the cost with the mat is NOT worth the money. You end up buying more toys and links, because what is included is limited. Buy it resale, or if you don't care about spending $ on a toy that is only good for 4 months. I think the Symphony gym (Fisher Price) though it has a few flaws, is a MUCH better play value item. I also liked Activity link gym, as it can be fun to sit in front of too. Sorry, I am one of the only ones that didn't go nuts over it. I think we buy toys sometimes because ""everyone"" has them, good or bad."
5,My baby daughter loves this mat!,"We got this as a shower gift and our daughter loves it, at six weeks old it really gets her attention and gives her something to look at besides us! I use it for her ""tummy time"" and also on her back she stares at the black and white lines and the toys that dangle. I am sure it will continue to be a favorite as she gets older and can reach for the items, I only wish the have four dangle toys so that all sides would have an object. (they mat comes with three)"
2,I would find something else,I have had this toy for 3 1/2 years. My now 3 year old never really wanted to use it. A few mins. now and then was all she wanted. I found that it was always in the way. When I had my next little girl (now 1) I figured it would be used this time. No such luck. The only time she had any fun with it was when her big sisters ran around finding other toys to attach to it. This toy takes up too much room and is too much money.
3,Baby not interested for very long,"Got this used. Baby didn't become interested in this until she was 4 months old. She is 5 months old now and is now starting to grow bored of it. I attached different toys to it, which kept her interest a little longer. I just take off the bars and use the mat now for playing on the floor. Really glad I didn't spend the money on this."
5,Love this!,"I bought this play gym because of the great reviews it has. My daughter was about 5 weeks old when I purchased it. She immediatly LOVED it. I got her to smile and laugh for the first time using this. She is now 14 weeks and will just lay under it and coo and talk and laugh. I use it also for diaper changes, just unsnap the criscrossing black and white overhang, and you can get at the baby. I have had to wash it once (see diaper change sentence ;)when she caught me by surprise changing her diaper, and it washed great. Easy to put away or store, lightweight, and durable. You must get this product if you have a baby!"
1,My baby hates this,"I got this at my shower so I've tried to get my baby to like it for 8 months now. She loves the colors red and black, but she hates this gym and she either ignores it or gets really, really mad at the hanging toys. The only thing she likes is the toy that plays music when you squeeze it. Am I the only one whose child finds this toy boring and annoying??"
2,falls down,I worked at a day care that had one of these. No one could get the bars to stay up. We never used it. It stayed folded up in a toy box.
3,New Mom,"I got this as a gift and was so excited knowing how wonderful everyone says it is. Unfortunately my son didn't share the same enthusiasm. I can see where other babies would love it, but my little guy wasn't too impressed. He would lay there for a limited time and stare at the toys but never really played with them until just recently. He is now 9 months and will sometimes play with the toys if they are taken off the gym. I would try again with my next baby."
1,Not Much to Rave about,"Maybe my daughter is still too young to enjoy this award winning toy, I find it just too plian and not very inspiring for babies. It comes with three attachments and you would have to buy more if you like to add a little more variety to your baby's enjoyment. I think the attachments cost about $5.00 each. Anyway, bottomline is, I think the fundamental value of this toy is very low and will not contribute much to your baby's development. (What's more, it's very expensive!)"
3,Great for about 20 minutes,I really like the play mat but the only thing my 2 month old likes is the mirror that comes with it. The musical flower only plays music for about 7 seconds so that's not very useful. They need more toys with it. Overall the only great thing about it is the mirror.
2,Not the best choice in an activity gym...,"I heard all the hullabaloo about babies loving black,red, and white colors because they are easy to focus on at an early age, and thought we should definetly choose this gym. Wrong for our baby! She showed NO interest in this gym, I tried adding more toys (because for the price it does come with VERY FEW), moving the bars up and down to make the toys ""dance"", all to no avail. She hates this thing, I would recommend instead the Tiny Love Deluxe Gymini with Lights and Music, or one of the Fisher Price Kick type gyms. We personally did not have a good experience with this gym and would not purchase one like it again. Music and/or lights seems to be a must for our baby to stay interested."
4,Pretty Good,"My daughter has really enjoyed this so far (3 months old). I honestly think she likes looking at the patterned arches better than the toys that were provided. We purchased the accessory set of three more toys to give her some variety. That way there's something on the mat when she's on her tummy, and we can change what she's looking at when she's on her back. I really like that the mat has patterns & shapes on it too because it gives her incentive to put her head up when we're having tummy time. She works to prop herself up on her arms so she can see what else is on the mat. The mat seems to collect dirt fairly easily, but it washes pretty well. The mat isn't quite as padded as I'd like, so I do have a thin quilt underneath to provide a little more comfort. I would recommend this."
5,fun for everyone,"My 4 month old was losing interest in this toy until I purchased 4 new things to add on and now he loves it again. The nice thing is that you can keep changing and adding toys as interest fades. I think this will still be fun for a toddler to climb under the arches as a sort of obstacle course type play. The durability of this product is excellent too. I have not been able to keep my 6 and 8 year old children out of it! The 10 year old thinks it's pretty neat too. Not only do all of the children use it, but 2 dogs love to climb all over it as well. Durable and entertaining."
5,Super gym!,We love this gym!! It was our daughter's first really favorite place to be. And she still plays under it at seven months old. I love to take it with us on trips because it's so portable. We use it all the time!!
5,Mommy's best friend!,"I got this for a baby shower gift and it has been one of the most valuable things I received! When I originally registered for this, I thought it was overpriced, but it is well worth the money. I have a 7 week old daughter and she absolutely LOVES her gymini. She will play under this anywhere from a half hour to an hour. She loves to look at herself in the mirror and it keeps here entertained for some time. There are many places to add more toys to the gymini, too. I change them and switch them around to give her a little variety. The only complaint I have about this is that the musical toy does not work at all. I think I must have gotten a defective one, but my daughter still loves to look at it. This is great for little ones who are not able to do a whole lot yet... keeps them very entertained."
5,BEST DIAPER BAG EVER,"The delux has better features however this is the best diaper bag. It's not bulky, however fits everything. i love the color red, it looks so cool on the stroller and doesnt bother me at alll."
3,Critique of 2/1gf by Max Hardy,"No question, Max sure knows his 2/1gf system...wish I could say the same for me after wading through it...I'm sure if you wanted to spend many hours sifting his text, you'd be a super 2/1 player, but in my estimation, the book needs two things: a better format, and example bids with each paragraph...I know that would lengthen book, but you have to IMAGINE the bidding from each little paragraph to get the sense of what he's saying. From his book, I conclude that 2/1 is too complex for me...too much memory work involved. Too bad, many people in Zone Bridge Club on the internet think highly of the system. Of course, I'm no expert...which is why I selected Max's book...to become one."
5,A Wonderful Miracle-Worker on Behalf of Heaven,"This is a wonderful book, on one of the finest miracle-workers Heaven ever produced. It has a lot of factual history, which would not be in most books about the Catholic Saints."
3,Salty,"Although this clam base has great flavor and you would expect something from the ocean to be salty, it is way too salty. I made the new england clam chowder and did not add any more salt---the soup was way to salty for us."
4,PS2 Driving Force Wheel works with PS3,"This forced feedback wheel works great on PS3 system. Note that the USB connection to the game system is required, and there is slightly less than 9' of USB cable attached to the wheel. If you need more, get a USB extender. Also, the wheel *REQUIRES* something to anchor to, sold separately. Read the reviews before you consider the Logitech Lap Attachment (and heed them!)."
4,"Fine addition to PS2 driving games, remember the mount!","The internet is filled with positive reviews about the Driving Force Pro -- so I'll add to the mix, but with a different spin.PROS: The wheel itself is great, with solid construction, good ""force feedback"", and excellent compatibility with my Sony PS2. I'm playing it mainly with GT4 and a little Burnout Revenge -- no problems. Very little learning curve, as this set-up is much more ""natural"" in the context of a driving game rather than a controller pad.CONS: The price is still high (though this website is among the cheapest), and it absolutely requires a STRONG, THIN tabletop for mounting. The clamps open no more than 1.25 inches. Many of the folding tables and TV stands are too unstable and/or too thick. I ended up buying a small computer desk for $20 from a nearby W***art store. So expect to add this cost to the total price.Overall, a good purchase."
3,Great Wheel practically new,"i loved the wheel becuase i got it at a good price price and it was practically brand new since it still had some of the stickers that you have to remove before playing. it also came with the manual, the box looked like it went through hell and back and it did not give a good first impression and it did take a lot a longer for me to recieve than what it thought it would which was the only draw back."
4,Great Addition to the PS3,"I am really happy with this steering wheel. The 900deg turn option rocks for games like F1. Makes the driving a lot more realistic. I don't have it permanently mounted on a table or anything, that is my only disatisfaction...but that is a problem with my setup, not the wheel. I also wish more games supported it!"
5,Logitech DFP wheel and pedals,This is my second Logitech DFP and I highly recommend it to those who do not want to pay and arm and a leg for a wheel and pedals. The unit is used with my PC and I race in three sim racing leagues so it gets a lot of use. I had my previous one for over 3 years with no problems and gave it to a friend after purchasing my new one. If you're on a budget this is a great purchase. I just hope they're still making it when I think it's time for a new one.
4,Mount it to what?,"I bought this item for my huband who is a total GT geek! He loves the game! So we thought this would be the perfect item to add a different element to the game. If you had been used to playing with just the PS2 controller (as he was) this makes the game more fun and more challenging. (It's like having 2 games in one - with the wheel and without).HOWEVER... what on earth do you mount the thing to??The wheel has too much force behind it to just set in your lap (even if you turn this feature off). Our dining room table was too far away and a fold up TV tray type of thing was not stable enough. We have gotten lots of different suggestions, but the makers of the game should have thought about this a little more. Also, the coffee table does not work because then you can not comfortably control the foot piece.Bottom line: Great addition to GT4, but you better have an old school desk on hand or set your TV on your dining room table!"
5,Love it !!!,"I bought it for my husband birthday. When he saw it, he could not wait to tried that for Gran Turismo 5 Prologue (PS3 game). It is very easy setup and he said much better than use PS3 WIRELESS CONTROLLER!!!"
4,A GT4 Requirement....,"Just my opinion...if you've been playing GT4 without it, you're going to have re-learn driving it. Steering feel is good, but I do have a few minor complaints. The brake and gas pedals do not have enough resistance -- it feels fake. Also, the shifter and the paddle shifters does not have enough ""mechanical-resistance-precision"". They are easy to double-click. The paddle shifters are located on the steering wheel, not steering column. You can be fumbling for the shifters during and/or after a turn. Finally, I wish there was a way to adjust the angle of the pedals. They seem way too upright for me making difficult to control gas and brake input (I place towel under mine).So, in summary, it's not perfect, but there's nothing out there that comes close to it.After ""Hundreds of Hours"" of use: Wheel still feels brand new. I was bit concerned with the durability of the wheel. Wheel provides a good workout -- my shoulders are getting larger. I think I need a life!"
4,Excellent choice,"For all PC users - it works on PC. I use it on my PC for Test Drive Unlimited & other games.In this price range you won't find anything better. Rugged construction, firm grip, good force feedback.The only thing that I don't like is that pedals pad slides on solid sufraces like hardwood even though it has got rubbers pads underneath.Also the mounting brackets in the unit are too short for some tables/desks.Overall it's a lot of fun."
1,for Neanderthals only,"The one surprising thing about this book is the skill with which the author manages to fit in every possible gender stereotype from the fifties and still have it published in the nineties. If you're looking for sexist jokes on how the baby will ruin both your sex life and your golf game, then this book may be for you. If you're looking for advice on how to be a good dad and support your partner through a very demanding time, then you're better off looking elsewhere."
2,Not for everyone,"If I wanted over 200 hundred pieces of inane advice on pregnancy, I'd ask my mother-in-law."
3,"Good read, somewhat helpful","The title makes it sound like it'll be funny. It is, at times, but much moreso, it's helpful. Lots of numbered/bulleted points of ideas, reminders, tips, guides, pointers, etcetera. I didn't read it until after the first birth, then read it during the second pregnancy, and wish I'd read it during the first. Good stuff."
4,Pretty cute lil book,I bought this for my husband when I found out I was pregnant. It's a quick read and has a lot of info for soon-to-be dads. It was nice when I heard my husband referencing the book when I would have a weird pregnancy symptom.
3,A little touchy feely for some men,"This book was very sweet from a pregnant woman's perspective. It has a lot of great tips like give your wife a back massage and such. While I'm all for being pampered- the book was just a bit too touchy feely for my husband and would probably bore him to tears- he didn't read even read it so there you go!It also didn't share much actual pregnancy information either so as others have said, its not a great pregnancy resource.If your husband is eager to be a part of pregnancy and loves to cuddle and cry- he might like this book. If you husband would rather be chopping wood than sharring his feelings with you- skip this one."
5,Good one,"My son-in-law is NOT a reader, but he is thrilled to be an almost dad. I got him this book at the same time I bought a book for my daughter. She told me he sat down and read it all in one evening, laughing and sharing some of the things with her. Worth the money for that!"
5,"Must have, must have, must have","I bought this book for my husband for my first pregnancy and it presented us with plenty of opportunity for discussion and oh, heavens above, more laughs than I could count. Barron's frank (some would say blunt) look at pregnancy through a man's eyes was soooooo refreshing. I was so happy to have found a book that would clue my hubby into what was going on without being preachy or boring. Sure, there are ""woman generalizations,"" but it's lets the reader in on an honest look at pregancy, which was a welcome change from other books geared toward daddy to be's. I have just learned I am about to become an aunt and I am ordering this book for my brother - if I remember correctly, anyone who's living with a hormonal pregnant woman deserves a little laughter in their lives :)!"
1,Avoid at all cost,"This book starts out by stating that it was written to fill some sort of gap in pregnancy literature for men. This was the third or so similar book I had read that claimed this, so I'm not so sure this is an accurate claim.Even if I choose to believe the author wrote this in good faith, I found it juvenile and condescending. There is little useful information within, and I found much of the information purely subjective (or misleading) and therefore useless for the most part. There are MANY better books out there for the father to be, that treat you as an adult (for example, see Curtis and Schuler).The humour in this book is premeditated, and many of the little anecdotes seem to be designed to prove the manhood of the father to the reader (although it comes off quite neurotic).Good points: It is short (although I wish I had that hour of my life back)."
1,Not What I Expected,"The reviews both by the author and other readers make this sound like a humorous and witty book. I, however, was offended by some of the insensitive and profane humor. There are other books available that make light of the sometimes tense but often wonderous experience of pregnancy without debasing either of the future parents. It certainly didn't teach me anything and I was embarrassed to share some of it with my partner. This is not a book to be proud of owning. I don't recommend it."
2,It's ok,"I got this for my husband, and he only read a couple of chapters and quit. When I asked him why, he said that it didn't tell him anything he already didn't know. He said it was a waste of money."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"If you are a first time father to be and have absolutely no inkling of sensitivity towards your wife and no clue what pregnancy is all about, then maybe you should get this book, but do yourself a favor and check it out from the library. The very fact that you can read it in a span of 10 minutes and catch all the useful information says a lot. You could surf the internet for 5 minutes and get all the info that is in this book. If it doesn't insult a man's intelligence - it should!"
3,"A cute book, but not a great pregnancy resource.","Although this book is very well written and will definitely elicit laughs from the reader, I was disappointed in the formatting and lack of real medical information. For example, my husband wanted to find out exactly what an amnio was, and tried to find out in this book - there is no index or guide, and he had to thumb through the book until he found it among random second trimester advice. The book is rather small, and is divided into 3 sections, one for each trimester. Maybe I'm just looking at it from a female standpoint, but both my husband and I were frustrated that there is really not any true medical content. This is a great, quick read (very funny and some sweet suggestions for every hubby) as long as you are just looking for a break from medical jargon and a humorous approach to each trimester."
4,"Great grooves, but more variety would have been welcome","This second solo album from Steely Dan singer Donald Fagan bubbles and pops with driving jazzy grooves. It's not the masterpiece that his first effort, ""The Nightfly"" was, but it's still quite good. ""Tomorrow's Girls"" has the most memorable refrain, but other favorites include ""Trans-Island Skyway"", ""Countermoon"", ""Springtime"", ""Florida Room"" and ""Teahouse on the Tracks"" which has some nice horn licks. The slower tunes, ""Snowbound"" and ""On the Dunes"" are actually a bit of a bore. But the biggest weakness of this fine CD is the perhaps the over-polished production and static arrangements that make these songs all sound too much the same. A little more variety would have been welcome. Fans of Steely Dan should definitely look into this."
5,Sophisticated Ear Candy,"If you have taken the time to actually search Kamakiriad you should just get it - so few have found it. If you need someone to convince you that you will like it, just move on - I doubt you will have the patience to discover it. Fagen writes juicy frameworks of short stories with the details - you fill in the big picture. Kamakiriad has individual songs but there is an overlying ""theme"" to the album - in my listening over the decade since its release it has become one of my top few favorite all-timers - unlike so many albums, the jazz/pop mix never gets old -in fact I find it constantly refreshing, entertaining, and new sounding - a true test of any worthwhile music. Similar pleasures can be found in much of Fagen's Steely Dan work and his only other solo album (to date) 1982's ""The Nightfly"". Welcome - Enjoy!"
2,not as good as it should have been,"Good, but ultimately disappointing. You start mightily impressed but end up losing concentration as it meanders on repetitively and obscurely. The Nightfly is far better."
3,Not up to Fagen standards,"Own just about everything this guy has ever done, both alone and in Steely Dan. This one didn't do it for me, when most everything else does. Can't put my finger on issues, just doesn't have the pizzaz that most others do. Arrangements are not as appealing with fewer fun ditties that stick in my head. Liked it fine, just expected to love it. Hard to live up to expectations when you set the bar so high, Mr. Fagen. Hey, LOVED Morph the Cat!!!"
2,"Disappointing follow-up to ""The Nightfly""","""Kamakiriad"" was reviewed to death by critics, and even every German newspaper or music magazine I know, had to write down some thoughts about this album. I think ""Kamakiriad"" is only a mediocre follow-up to the great ""Nightfly"" and isn't worth the press-hype at all. It suffers from songs that sound far too similar, and especially the nerve-rackingly sharp drums aren't varied. The arrangements are too overloaden, and the songs are cold, hectic and sterile. Certainly I feel that there's a lot of work and perfectionism in this record, but there also should be a minimum of humanity in these futuristic surroundings!"
2,"This Isn't Steely Dan, But It's Still Okay!","When I first got this CD I thought it was quite good. Actually, the more I listened to it the less I liked it. Maybe, it was just what I was going through at the time...But, I listened to it again recently and only really like 3 songs. Florida Room, Snowbound, and On The Dunes. The rest of the tunes are okay, but this isn't Steely Dan. Save your money and buy Aja, The Royal Scam, or about anything else from them."
3,Left-hand driver...,Maybe the fact that the car is for driving in England might help explain why you get no sense of direction throughout the entire album. It's lost. I guess it's hard to top Aja and The Night Fly
4,Just half of Steely Dan....,"While good and a grand listen, it represent just half of Steely Dan. About two-thirds of the magic is there, too. Worthwhile and some songs really kick it, so get it and groove it."
3,alright but not nightfly,i always look foreward to anything associated with Steely Dan.and when Donald Fagen drop this disc i was excited.but after listening to it i came away only digging Snowbound&Tomorrow's girl.the music was very steely dan and the arrangements as well as the vocals but the feeling wasn't felt all thru this disc. Nightfly is a better disc.still i can't wait for the new disc by Steely Dan.
5,We've seen the future and it's....Donald Fagen?,"Whereas Fagen's earlier release ""The Nightfly"" focused on a central theme based in the past, 1993's ""Kamakiriad"" takes you on a futuristic road trip. The same can also be said of the music. While The Nightfly still borrowed largely from the Steely Dan ""Gaucho"" sound, Kamakiriad is much more contemporary (and hinted at the sound Dan-Heads could expect years later when Becker & Fagen resurrected the band name in 2000). This album is primarily smooth-jazz (a.k.a. ""cocktail-jazz""), but it's a nice mix of up-tempo numbers and slower, smoother tunes. ""Tomorrow's Girls"" received some radio play, and if you remember it and liked it, this album is for you. Owners of Steely Dan material from the new millenium will also appreciate this one. I purchased this record in 1995 and it's still as fresh today as it was back then."
4,Only a couple of classics but well-done nonetheless,"This album, the sophomore effort by Steely Dan alum Fagen, is not nearly as enjoyable asThe Nightfly(his first effort) but there are a couple of flashes of brilliance on this album; Snowbound and On The Dunes are truly great songs that strike deep. Springtime, Tomorrow's Girls and Florida Room are most definitely enjoyable. The remaining 3 songs are good listening, especially if you are a danfan, but they lack that special something that I have grown accustomed to hearing when I listen to Fagen, Becker or Steely Dan.Overall, a good album and a must have for any Steely Dan fan; Nightfly would have been hard to beat, so I cannot really take away from Fagen on this album, but rather just state that he set the bar a little too high on his first outing."
5,"A soothing, relaxing mind journey","Donald Fagen's latest album, Kamakiriad, definitely holds true to the principles and musicals standards set forth by Steely Dan in the late seventies. As they grow older their work becomes more cheerful in mood, however, the sense of irony is never lost. Kamakiriad is a terrific follow-up album. It seems that another is long overdue. Dan fans keep their fingers crossed that the new album will be out soom."
4,Return to Countdown to Ecstasy ... Almost,"When you hear that first funky lick of the title track, you wonder ""is this 1972 again?"" Complex beats have always separated the best Steely Dan albums from the merely good. Although the clever ironic lyrics aren't wuite here, at least there is intense longing (like ""On the Dunes"") and humour (""Tomorrows Girls"") that are Fagan trademarks. And on top of that, it's a concept album. This was far from a safe route for him to travel, no pun intended. Don't let the grammy stop you from buying it."
4,Handwriting in America: A Cultural History,"An interesting book, but it should have been titled ""The Teaching of Handwriting in America"". Also, it missed a kind of writing which I can't name, but know when I see it - for example, something like ""California"" on California auto license tags. It was taught in America, and it was the model in England for many years - a Life magazine article around 1950 showed such examples from the winners in an English schoolboy competition. (My father learned this style in a preparatory school in the South in the early 1900s, and one of our daughters-in-law was taught the same way.)One reviewer adversely criticized this book for harping on, perhaps even imagining, sexism in the early teaching of handwriting, and I don't think the comment was deserved - I believe the author was accurately describing what was actually taught, and gave it no more space than is warranted."
5,excellent reading with a satisfying conclusion,Mr. Harrison was able to appropriately bring his Eden trilogy to a satisfying conclusion...quite a task for a trilogy of such broad scope. Surprizingly tender in the inevitability of the 2 races (Yilante and Tanu) situations.
2,Prehistoric C-Span,"West of Eden was one of the most interesting and thought-provoking books I've ever read. I can't recommend it highly enough.Unfortunately, Return to Eden (and to a similar extent, Winter in Eden) isn't anywhere near as interesting a book. The story, while well written, just doesn't go anywhere. It seems to me as if Kerrick and the other humans do a lot of wandering around around the continent, and the Yilane spend a lot of time talking rudely to one another. Though the prose is excellent, the content reads like C-Span."
5,Alternative history at it's best,"This third volume of the Eden trilogy brings everything to a satisfactory but predictable closure. There is enough left open to hope for a possible ""Back to Eden"" in the future.The relationships between the Yilane(dinosaur) and Tanu (human)are almost as good as the Lizard/Human relations in Harry Turtledoves' World War series. The story is much richer simply because there are not as many story lines as Turtledove keeps going.A really good read but I think only available in pricey trade paperback. I was able to easily find all 3 in used shops with very little trouble."
5,Eloquent style and poignant writing,"This book is a brilliant and touching first work, its form mimicking that of the much-referred to time capsule where the story finds its ultimate center. The narrator Karin brings segments of her life together in a non-narrative jumble, but in doing so she seeks to reclaim the pieces of her life that, regardless of the false stories she spins around them, in the end exist, and the fact that they happened, not what exactly happened, is what is most important to her. Unlike the buried time capsule that holds objects that those in the future will have to interpret for themselves, with the help of the descriptions left by people decades ago, Karin takes control of her own lifeline, and that is what she leaves the reader with in the end. Ullmann's style is provoking and effective."
1,a disappointment...,"This was a book ""heavy"" to read. While reading, I found myself thinking constantly: what's the author's point? I also did not really like the way the author jumps from one event to another without a real time-logic. Often the author gets lost in describing lots of details, too many for a reader that has not really a clear idea what is the point of the narrator. There are some good ideas but they get lost in a sea of words and non-sense. All this makes the reading from interesting to real slow and boring. It never took me so long to read a book and I have to confess that I had a hard time in finishing it."
2,Not for me,"I gave this book a shot, but by the end I was too confused and tired to care what happened to the characters. The deception, rambling, and exaggeration proved to be too much for my little mind to take. In some ways I guess it was stimulating (since I spent so much time struggling over whether I should believe the narrator), but not in a way that I found particularly enjoyable."
3,On Thin Ice,"Ullmann's,'Before You Sleep' updates middleclass, staus quo mores, cruising and crashing through the late twentieth century. The author, daughter of superb actress Liv and the director of her most famous films, Ingmar Bergman, guaranteed my curiosity. Plus having paternal grandparents from Trondheim, the setting of the story. Was it repaid? Her dry and often cruel humour lifts this tale of white collar dysfunction from tedium. Her surreal sexual fantasies are clever rather than convincing. Early on, the narrator declares that's she's learnt the value of deceit, thus inviting our complicity...trust me, I lie, so to speak.It works, but is a bit thin on description: the kind of feral, long weekend that a feminine Charles Bukowski(heaven forbid!) might revel in. But that's a different climate and culture. I hankered for more evocation of place to deliver me to Trondhein or Oslo."
5,Courage to Run--Rave Reviews,"No wonder Courage to Run is receiving rave reviews from everyone.Wendy Lawton is a master storyteller, bar none. Usually, dialect distracts me in the written word, but not with this story. Wendy's ability to weave the dialect, colorful descriptionand emotion into this book kept me turning the pages. It was obvious that the author did tons of research to bring Minty (Harriet Tubman) to life and make the reader care so much about her. This is a book that will certainly win awards and acclaim."
4,NICE BUT........,"IT'S GREAT TO HEAR FROM WALTER AND DONALD AGAIN (BOTTOM LINE) NICE DISC.... A LITTLE ""WATTERED"" DOWN, LETS NOT EXPECT ANOTHER AJA OR CLOSE TO THAT ""CLASSIC""!ONE DISAPPOINTMRNT: THEIR PAST WORK WAS A WHO'S WHO OF BEST STUDIO MUSICIANS IN THE BUISNESS (BAR NONE! STEVE GADD, WAYNE SHORTER, DEAN PARKS etc.....NOT HERE)"
3,Jaded in General...,"Hey, it's not Donald and Walt's fault. I've been pretty much jaded since Santana made his ""listen to me trying to sound 90s"" comback. Unlike Santana, this dynamic duo retains the sound that made us all love them in the first place. Problem is, I can't smell a hit on this album. (Maybe ""Janie Runaway."" What do you guys think?) Although the sound is classic Steely and the lyrics quirky, it's like settling for a burger when you wanted filet mignon.I adored ""The Nightfly"" and ""Kamikiriad,"" but I feel this album is a bit stale. I'm tired of people telling me in reviews that it will ""grow on me."" I expected Steely to JUMP ON ME! : )Ah well, they are kind of old after all..."
5,Two Defeat Nature,"The Dan returns after 20 years sounding better than ever. When I first heard Steely Dan in the early 70's, their sound seemed far ahead of it's time. Amazingly, they still can capture audiences of all types because of the diversification of the music. This is a masterpiece, from the funky beat of Two Against Nature blending with the soulful Jack of Speed to form a complete package. Buy it now, and enjoy."
4,Not quite a Steely Dan classic.,"When all the hype dies down listeners will come to realise that this is a very good, but not great Steely Dan effort. The compositions are strong, but not quite classic Steely Dan compositions. The only other flaws can be found in the drumming and guitar solos. A more jazz oriented drummer (Bernard Purdie sure is missed) would have complimented the numbers better. Where Becker is a decent guitarist he is not as expressive or creative as Larry Carlton, Denny Dias or Skunk Baxter. Tasty, just not outstanding. Overall, the disc won't disappoint, just don't buy all the hype. It is nice to have 'em back....Simon"
4,Solid But Not Brilliant,"A solid record but not exceptional. The songs are funky and groove-oriented and the sound/feel is similar to Faegen's ""Kamakiriad."" As usual, clever lyrics, good hooks, top musicians and precise production. Complaints: I'd like to hear a little more of a rock edge--a bit too ""smooth jazz"" sounding. Becker's guitar solos are mediocre."
2,Mildly Disappointed - Too long a wait for too little,"Back in 1996 while on tour Fagen commented about the upcoming CD, and how they hoped to ""finish it before we die"". Well three plus years later they are still alive and the Two Against Nature result is a mild disappointment of this 30 year Dan fan. I can only guess now that the 4 years spent making this CD is a result of lack of inspiration for Donald & Walter, and it became a ""lets just get it over with""! With the exception of but a couple tracks, the CD for me is quickly forgetable, and destined to collect dust rather than be dusted off and played again & again like that of Aja, Gaucho, and Fagen's masterpiece Kamakiriad. Such a disappointment is this that even the upcoming tour holds no interest now...especially after their lackluster performance at the Gorge in 1996. Thanks anyways fella's."
2,"Flawless, But Absolutely Boring !","A mediocre SD album is still always better than an album of whatever pop or R&B clone whose name I cannot remember, but this current disc of SD brings up thoughts on what we can do to make the next one better. I do have a few suggestions: Add Larry Carlton as the 3rd permanent member of Steely Dan; Keep Walter Becker's guitar playing restricted to rhythm parts; Hire a real bass player; Give the drummers some air that the grooves become deeper and more intense; Hire the same horn section (they are doing an excellent job on this album) and hire Gary Katz and Genji Siraisi as producers for the next album that we are hopefully more thrilled the next time an SD album comes out. It is all just too sterile now in a way that I can only categorize it as being excellent car music."
2,Hope for better,"With a new Steely Dan CD due this summer, it probably isn't worth expending energy to pan their last one. But as a hard-core fan for almost 30 years (scary) I found this effort to be tedious and predictable. To my ears, they wrapped their sound around itself to where there was little left to distinguish each song. Every trademark Steely Dan element -- memorable guitar solos, snappy horn arrangements, clever melodic hooks, oblique lyrics -- is a weak imitation of former works. I look forward to the new CD since I wouldn't want this to be the capstone to a brilliant catalog of works."
3,Stick to the stereo offering,"I enjoyed the musicianship and lyrics on this DVD-A, but was less than impressed with the multichannel mix. There was too much information in the L/R rear surrounds that made this DVD-A sound more like a movie sound effects soundtrack than a music DVD. I would definitely listen to this DVD in the enhanced stereo mode."
5,Can anyone top this?,"These guys are the most demanding tandem in the biz... Perfect to the last chord. Excellent audio/video. This is why it is imperative to record in Dolby Digital 5.1 and record on a studio soundstage. I have watched this a dozen times in a month. Everyone loves it, you will toooo!"
3,Reeling in the Years.........,"These guys actually sound timeless! TWO AGAINST NATURE is a classic ""listen"" album. Don't worry about the cuts. Don't worry about the the lyrics, (yet). Just get a book, dim the lights, and turn on the sound system. Jazz meets smooth pop - a very good piece of work. Now if I can only get that early 70's aroma back to my room without getting busted......"
1,Could Have Been Better Part 2,"My original review ""Could Have Been Better"" gave this DVD three stars. I need to take that back, because the more I watch it, the more upset I get.The video is not good ... weird ""tilt angle"" shots with many frames that appear out of focus and blurred. We should expect all concert DVD's (filmed currently and in the future) to show the entire uninterrupted show, multiple camera angles, good sound in 5.1 & stereo, clear video, with interviews and other ""filler material"" as extras and not put between songs.The only thing that redeems this DVD, besides the band, is the audio during the ""concert footage"". I want a refund!"
5,Naturally...... Good Stuff,"Nice to see Steely Dan return to the scene. Their live tour a few years back was a warmup to their natural home...the studio. This CD proves once again that Walter and Donald are master craftsmen. Flawless music for sure. Consider this CD an investment....you will not get tired of listening to it. Try out title cut ""Two Against Nature"" and ""Jack of Speed."" Last track ""West of Hollywood"" will please any jazz fan. Feel sorry for ""Cousin Dupree."" Lyrics will tickle your funny bone. This is a good one....go get it!"
4,Faithful To A Tee,"This is an album on DVD.The gifted duo has once again surrrounded themselves with superlative sidemen and produced a dvd fitting their legacy. Yes,they could have included such luminaries as Jeff ""Skunk"" Baxter but they stayed away from the more incindiary guitar work songs which would have been spectacular (hope they do someday)but included their heart and soul and reproduced it to a level not often found on dvd. For fans of Steely Dan their songs are like a glove that fits various moods of their life.The songs included are recreated with all the heart ,soul and passion that made you like them in the first place.Yes,some favorites are missing but what is here is truly wonderful.Tight ,soulful,funky and introspective.THIS IS STEELY DAN.Would have been 5 stars if Bodhisattva and a few others were included.Great!!!!"
5,I hope they do another for Everything Must Go!!!,"I have been a big Steely Dan fan for many years. I was able to catch some of this performance on a local PBS station a year ago, but I missed the show in its entirety. Ever since then I have been trying to find myself a copy especially since I saw them in concert this year. I highly recommend this disk to any fan or even someone who enjoys seeing a group of top notch players getting together. The camera angles can be a bit annoying at times but the sound more than makes up for it and listening to Becker and Fagen talk with the band and others between songs is great to. Buy it and enjoy! You won't be disappointed."
3,Yeah the 70's are over but the albums endure,"I know, I'm probably waxing nostalgic, but those Steely Dan albums are the best....and I even own the Fagan/Becker early stuff! Great stuff! I was so psyched about this album....and disappointed after...I gave it several listens and there wasn't anything memorable about it. No doubt the musicianship is great, but no spark for me here. Better I think to live in the past in this particular instance. Buy this album if you're a serious fan, but if just discovering Steely Dan stick to the older stuff."
2,Boring,"I would have been happy with either classic S.D. style or something updated, as long as it was good. I've listened to the CD many times now... All but three songs were uninteresting from the first listen. All but one song get tiring after a repeated exposure. The remaining song is certainly not up to classic S.D. standards, and is not good enough to carry this lame album.Disappointed..."
3,Who are we kidding?!!,"After 20 years Steely Dan could have made a CD of Gregorian Chants and we'd be all falling over ourselves throwing five stars around saying how much we missed them and how they haven't changed at all. Well music HAS changed in 20 years....the reason Santana's Supernatural is a classic is because it's Santana's voice but at the same time he realizes it's the year 2000 and uses current artists and textures to interpret the music. Gaslighting Abbie is pure Steely Dan and you really do miss them and welcome them back, but like an in-law that overstays their welcome, midway thru the CD you're ready to open up and play the other new CD that you bought the day you bought Two Against Nature..."
2,Re-priming the pump,"Steely Dan needs to follow up quickly so that this re-entry is quickly overshadowed by a more formidable effort that we all know they are capable of producing. Speaking of producing, they need Gary Katz back (or someone of similar calibre). Becker should stick to producing lower profile projects. Fagan has proven he is capable of facilitating some of the greatest music made in the last half century (e.g. The Nightfly, The Royal Scam, Aja, Gaucho, etc.) Kammakiriad was forgivable. This one will be harder to forgive if they don't give us something to forget it soon."
3,Two Against Melody,"I am a huge, lifelong Dan fan, but this CD was a disappointment. It's Steely Dan lite. Fagen and Becker have admitted in interviews that they are not into melody anymore and it really hurts 'em on this one. The songs are flat and just kind of lack energy in general. Pleasant enough to listen to (and I will keep doing so), but something's missing. People who don't like Steely Dan think all their stuff sounds like this."
2,"It's the melodies, stupid!","I read, in some newspaper, an interview with Donald Fagen where he said that the melodies in his songs where no longer important to him. Unfortunately, unless your into words, or more directly, his words, then this CD is a big disappointment. No, the melodies do not have to be like their album ""Aja"", but it would be nice to here something like ""The Royal Scam"". All of these current offerings seem to run on like one endless song. There is nothing catchy. By that I don't mean funky, but catchy like ""Kid Charlemagne"" or ""Green Earrings"". I used to think that ""gaucho"" was their worst album. That album is great compared to this. 20 years and this is the best they can do? Very depressed."
3,BE VERY CAREFUL,"I gave this a 3 star because the music is actually quite good, but the version I got only has a still picture of a lawn and a couple chairs, BUT NO ACTUAL VIDEO ON THIS DVD...Aparrently this is just designed to be played like a CD but in DVD form for surround sound. Seeing how I already had the CD I wasn't too pleased with this copy. I wanted the issue that shows them playing to a studio audience, but I got a glorified CD instead...."
1,"""THE REAL SCAM""","Let me start by stating that I really dig Steely Dan, but Ihave to be honest: this album stinks. I bought this album withouthearing any of the tracks. I made the mistake of assuming that any new Steely Dan album would rock, but this doesn't even roll. Shame on you! END"
3,Steely Dan needs rhythm energy,"I have been a ""DanFan"" for way over 25 years. When I heard ""Pretzel Logic"" and "" Katy Lied"" I was blown away for months and years! I was very excited to know these two were releasing a new album after all these years. Again, the melodies and chord progressions and moods created here are superb but why did they have the drummers sound like drum machines? God,it makes the whole darn thing lifeless!!! Their songs on this album would benefit with some creative and energetic drumming rather than the stupid,meaningless plodding playing evidenced here. So what that they matched the click track? The drum tracks suck all the life out of these songs. Darn!!!!"
2,Disappointing Steely Dan!,"I've been an SD fan for many years and was disappointed with this effort. Put it against their earlier stuff and you're immediately struck by the loss of the biting guitar riffs and melodic lines. It's a well done effort, but for them not up to par."
3,"This is Donald Fagen, not Steely Dan","This CD seems more like a Donald Fagen CD than that of the Steely Dan of the 70s. The music on this CD, while good, is more of a light jazz CD as opposed to rock and roll. The drums maintain the same light, lounge-music-like beat throughout the disk. If this CD were promoted as a Donald Fagen CD I think it would be more honest than trying to pass it off as Steely Dan."
2,Wooden Daniel,"The lamely deadened, 20-years-waiting comeback disc finds the once challenging, jazz-influenced rock elitists settling into a more modern lull. Steely Dan's signature lyrical humor and melodic grooves are overhauled and placed neatly into spaces that all too often feel corny and restrictive. The production is too shiny and only elaborates some horribly implemented musical ideas, particularly in the forced vocals. If the title track were a poor example of the album's feel, we would be in good shape. Sadly Two Against Nature remains one of the stiff disc's only mildly engaging (ie naturalistic) tracks amongst rare glimpses of songwriting talent. When they do strain for musically rewarding passages, it is apparent they have become bloated on their own questionable mythology, confusing the interchanging of a bunch of snazzy jazz chords with thought out transitioning..a veritable comatose caricature of what once was."
2,Sorry to be so negative,"I'm a huge Steely Dan fan. However, while the sound and musicianship are here, the songwriting is terribly weak. There simply aren't any good melodies. I can hardly distinguish the tunes. Prior Steely Dan was an unbeatable combination of great musicians and wonderful songwriting. Not here, to my taste. I wish I could say something better, but if you don't have any of their other albums, go buy those."
2,Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaajor disappointment.,"Steely Dan is my favorite band of all time. After loving Aja, Countdown to Ecstasy, the Royal Scam, Katy Lied and Pretzel Logic, I was immensly disappointed by Two Against Nature. Donny and Wally seem to have lost their creativity and just sort of threw the album together to keep the fans from dying. Most the songs are quite boring.But it's still worth a buy, for three songs: Two Against Nature, Jack of Speed, and West of Hollywood. And this isn't a slump, just a little bump in the road--Everything Must Go has the quality of all seven classic albums. I think they should've canned the six bad tracks and kept the aforementioned good songs, then put them on Everything Must Go instead.I'd reccomend any one of the 70's-80's albums (Can't Buy a Thrill, Countdown to Ecstasy, Pretzel Logic, Katy Lied, the Royal Scam, Aja, and Gaucho) or Everything Must Go instead."
2,Disappointment with a few highlights,"""Disappointment compared to all of the Dan's other studio output. This CD is flat-out boring. There isn't a single tune in here that has the same individuality as almost anything else Steely Dan ever did. Every tune is a loping mid-tempo beat, with wordy lyrics and extremely annoying vocals. Not a decent groove in the bunch. Walter Becker's guitar solos are all eighth-note wonders with no particular distinction. He's improved in the ten or so years between Dan albums, just not enough to make a convincing front-line guitarist in the Dan tradition. Great studio production can't make up for mediocre, enervated songwriting. The exception is the mid-tempo number (again) ""Jack of Speed"" which was basically the breakout hit off this disc, and which I covered in a band once. Good song. I'm glad they're back, but I wish they'd get their harmonic edge back."
2,Too bad,"Yes, I too ordered this CD weeks before release in the hopes of hearing a new ""destined to be a classic"". Instead I was the first kid on the block to be disappointed. This release is a rehash of Fagan's ""Kamakiriad"" rejects (Granted Kamakiriad took some getting used to). I dare say no song from either that or this release will ever be played on an oldies station of tommorow. This is Two Against Natural musical sensibilitiesMonotonous beats, repetitious lyrics, uninspiring harmonies and lack of riffs have never been part of the Steely Dan appeal. Please fellas, if you can't make the magic don't sell out your name. What happened to compassion and wisdom? To me there is no new Steely Dan album just disappointment. This disc has no place in my collection and is for sale to the first person who thinks the kings have new clothes."
2,Why?,"Why did I buy this album? I have my CD ""wish list"" and somehow this got onto it. After listening to it, I cannot imagine why. Don't get me wrong, I do like Steely Dan (Aja is a classic). But this album really misses that mark by a mile. Sure, it may be good elevator music, but it has none of the spark of the other albums."
2,I'LL PASS...,"Are the lyrics there? Yes. Is the music there? Hell no. And when did Fagan forget how to sing?Sorry, but what gets me about an album like this (or a group like this) is how many Dan fans are ""groupies"" - these guys could come out with a pile of pure drivel (not that I find that likely) and people would be lined up talking about how amazing it is. Blech. Musically speaking, I think this is their weakest album ever, by FAR. Even their solo efforts (some great stuff but not up Dan levels) surpasses it without even blinking. I'm glad I got to listen to it before wasting money on it.By ordinary standards there are things to like, but by ""Dan standards,"" it's not worth the buy. Sorry Dan groupies. Peace, you crazy diamonds. (OOPS sorry wrong group)"
2,A major disappointment,"I've listened to this CD a couple-three times now and Steely Dan fans who are looking for another quantum leap recording like Countdown to Ectasy, Katy Lied or Aja will be disappointed. Fagen has not moved on from the Kamkatriad sound and only two or three of the tracks here are have the liveliness and energy one associates with Steely Dan. You get the feeling they could have done much better -- All in all a pretty poor effort."
1,Hope I die before I get old...,"I may be a hardcore Dan fan, but to me, this album lacks a pulse. I miss the raw urgency (and energy) of this group as displayed in the vocals of ""Don't Take Me Alive"" and in the horn arrangement and playing in the ""Royal Scam."" For those of you unfamiliar, listen to the pleading horns in this signature track of the Royal Scam album.T.A.N. may be sophisticated and ""mature"", but it lacks the edge of their early work (pre-Aja). The bottom line is that these very talented musicians have changed and matured, and their music has also changed. These are different people now, and their music is different. Better? I think not. I may be almost as old as these guys, but T.A.N. IS NOT FOR ME."
2,This is Steely Dan?,"I hate to trot out the ""what happened?"" cliche but what happened? Fagen used to be able to write songs. This is a collection of grooves with indescriminate words tacked on and thus is indistinguishable from his last solo album and will probably be indistinguishable from the next Steely Dan album. Can't Buy a Thrill and Katy Lied were collections of superlative songs performed by exciting musicians. Two Against Nature is Donald and Walter cooly jamming for 45 minutes, or an hour. Who knows; I stopped paying attention after about ten minutes."
2,sorry,"Sorry, I just couldn't get into this after a few listens. It's not the Steely Dan that I came to enjoy over the years. Nothing kept my attention, and I found myself moving on to another disc prematurely."
1,Save Your Money - Get The Classics,"This is just junk. If, like me, you're a fan of their classic CD's, then don't waste your money on this, really, you're going to be disappointed.I wish someone would have been this honest with me before I bought it!"
3,This is just good enough to buy,"This is just good enough to go and buy it. Keep your expectations low and you may actually like it. Easy listening, but most possible, easy to regret buying this record. It's a taste thing. I do not urge people to buy this."
2,Mostly awful,"What a shame about Steely Dan. The immaculate production and stellar musicianship that Becker & Fagen and their various cohorts are known for are present in spades - but the album is junk.Steely Dan albums are not usually boring. Two Against Nature is. Only ""What A Shame About Me"" and the catchy, hilarous ""Cousin Dupree"" are even halfway decent. Everything else on this album is insubstantial, colorless wallpaper - tasteful, but bland.Some folks have compared Two Against Nature to Donald Fagen's last album, Kamakiriad. I would have to agree. When I first heard that album, I thought, ""Can you say 'no musical development whatsoever'?"" Two Against Nature answers that question with a resounding ""NO"".What a shame.P.S. - Okay, it's not quite that bad. Two Against Nature does make for decent background listening once in a while. But, I still wish it were better."
4,They Can Still Get You Spellbound,This is the first original Steely Dan album I listened at full length. I got hooked to Cousin Dupree or Almost Gothic which still got classic Steely Dan allure. It is nicely organized. On the whole I like this album a lot.
5,You must own this.,"This is a great record. Standouts are West of Hollywood, Two Against Nature, Almost Gothic and Negative Girl. Almost Gothic is so beautiful it hurts to listen. West of Hollywood, Two Against Nature and Negative Girl are musically inventive, adventurous, sophisticated, and just plain thrilling. Listen to these songs with headphones twenty times, and each time you'll discover new breathtaking details. There are great solos throughout the record, several of which belong to saxophonist Chris Potter -- what a find. Fagen and Becker are simply brilliant. If you buy one CD this year, blah blah blah. You know the rest!"
4,Recommended,"This disc is good, in that it has four (count 'em four) different mixes available: DVD Audio, DTS, Surround Sound, and standard stereo mix. One caveat though -- although all DVD players will play this DVD, not all have DVD Audio capability. On the contrary, MOST players actually are lacking the chip. But if you have DTS or a good surround sound system, this disc stretches those formats to their limits. The actual music? Well, I will assume that if you're here you already have an opinion of some sort about that."
5,Welcome Back,"5 outta 9 songs are classic Steely Dan. The other 4 songs are at least good sax jams, or decent filler. FIVE CLASSIC Steely Dan cuts. Defenitly worth the cash my friends. I'm feeling pretty blissed out- What a Shame about Me indeed!"
4,What's not to like?,"Years ago when I heard SD was getting together again after so long I wasn't interested. When the cd came out I was curious but not excited. When it won the Grammy for best album I figured that a whole lot of folks thought highly of their effort so I finally broke down and bought it. It's great. It's funky, slick, clever and darn near perfect in its production. Every song grows on you and it's as infectious as any of their offerings were back in the 70s and 80s. They just don't sound like anybody else and nobody else sounds like them. That's quite a compliment in the history of recorded music."
4,"Very pleasant concert, interviews distracting","The first time you watch, you are pleased with the overall experience. The music is a nice mix of new and old -- I was a huge fan in the 70's and kind of lost touch with Dan. Now that they are back, the new music is a pleasant jazzy sound. The second, third, etc viewing force you to hit the skip button on the interviews."
4,"Great, inspiring music and musicians BUT...","...constant out of sync pic/sound; the picture is by far less than one second late, but might appear disturbing and should be obvious to any untrained eye. Furthermore there are millions of moving camera angles constantly switching. Looks like they've let a hyper kid into the editing room; 5+ second still camera angles are few. If you find this disc cheap, though,--or if you're a true fan and don't care what it costs--you can put it on and just listen, because as I wrote - these are inspiring performances by great musicians.The disc consists of concert material with a few words in between the tracks. 102 minutes. 5.1 sound available (great audio quality,) but no extras."
5,Not a Disappointment,"For anyone who sat on a bar stool in the 70s getting happily buzzed to Steely Dan on the juke box after a long night of disco dancing, this CD is for you. Sure, it sounds like their old stuff, and thank God for that. It's working-class jazz, and it never goes out of style."
5,Gotta Love It,"The classic sounds, top notch sound quality, smart azz lyrics, you gotta love it. This is as good as anything, yes even AJA , they have ever done. Less rock more the N.O. jazzy sounds, but delicious none the less. They need to keep working since the sparks still there. Plus no ""featuring talentless Rap star"" of the month like so many artists are forced to do by Lamo record companies. To me nothing ruins an album more than a ""guest rapper"" with no musical talent making childish rhymes over the music."
3,Another Album for Dan Fans,"Undeniably masters of west-coast, jazz-pop fusion, in fact more correctly the inventers of it, SD has produced another recording for the collection. But don't set your expectations too high or you may be dissapointed - I was. And don't expect to find yourself singing along - you won't. The effect is fightningly similar to the latest Star Wars release; not really new, not really inspired; only essential if you're a fan. Twenty years ago most of this material would have probably ended up on the cutting room floor and twenty years from now this probably won't be regarded as their best work. The only explanation that I can come up with for the Grammy awards is that it makes great background music for Hollywood parties with that classic LA groove in the background that rebels against everything pop yet doesn't require any real affinity for jazz to appreciate and makes you seem cool for knowing about it."
4,Par for the course for Steely Dan results in a great listen,"OK, I am moderately knowledgeable about Steely Dan. I have Decade of Steely Dan, Nightfly and Kamikiriad. Even as a child, I was struck by the great SD/Fagen songs on the radio, and I have developed a deeper appreciation for the band ever since.Two Against Nature is a nice glass of wine. It's smooth and assuring, but then it intoxicates you when you least expect it. The production emphasizes jazz and soul, and is efficiently paced. I really like the title track and negative girl, but the jewel is almost gothic, which captures the enigma that is woman as well as any song I've heard in recent memory.Personally, I don't think the album sounds as dated as many have implied. In any event, I would recommend two against nature to anyone.Now, does anyone know where I can get a copy of Aja? Just kidding."
4,"For those that ""get it"". Get it.","Great album. Travelling back in time already. Got the old surf team together, waxed down the boards and juiced up the tape deck.Don's voice lacks of the anger and bite of old and I miss some of the melody but when warmed up, the songs cook like the old Dan. Esp. ""Shame"", ""Jack"" and the Cous', which hooked even my two year old. The others take a little more work but somehow all songs hit the groove about 1/3 in.Re: the re-union, the whole IS greater than the sum of the parts.Don and Walt, if your reading... We still love you ! Dont forget to write."
2,"It's the Grammies, Man","Since Donald was hideously overlooked by the Grammy people for TheNightfly and Kamakiriad, both works of unfathomlable genius, maybe he thought that if he wrote something more ordinary he'd get their attention. Long live Dan."
3,not the same,"Even die hard fans will have trouble with this one. Short on energy, horns and lead guitar, the album is like sleep walking through a Steely Dan dream. Does middle age need to be so boring? It's Fagen's distinctive voice and hints of Becker's stellar guitar, but it's not the same.."
2,Too long in the studio,"Being a devoted Steely Dan fan and looking forward to the new recording, I found it uninspiring. All of the selections have that familiar Becker and Fagen sound and lyrical satire but the songs are devoid of any expressed musical feeling. As I listened through the CD, I did not find one tune that ever got further than the starting gate. There is a chrome polished (weak) groove to each song but polish alone will not take the listener anywhere.Technically the recording sounds very very digital dry. It is very clean but lacks the life and especially the breath and depth of previous Steely Dan recordings. The sound is tight, overly controlled and in a word, dark.We Dan fans can all hope that someday Becker and Fagen will get back to the passion of the music that once gave us ""the chills"" while listening."
2,"SORRY FOLKS, THUMBS DOWN","I have waited twenty years for this album and I must say I'm dissapointed. A few of the songs satisfy this S.D. fan, but the rest sound like a band trying very hard to sound like Steely Dan. I got lost in the boring, lackadaisical attempts to match that original Fagen/Becker genius. Steely Dan haven't grown up, they've grown old."
2,Two Against Nature---Too Similar,Tunes too similar--album lacks the diversity in sounds of their great ones.
2,uninspiring song writing,"Of course Steely Dan is perhaps the greatest band of all time. However, Two against Nature is perhaps their most uninspired album. It is about as boring as Fagen's second solo album. The Nightfly was truly exceptional work. I don't mean to be harsh with my 2 star rating, but the true proof of great Steely Dan is how many of their songs I sing during the day: Your Gold Teeth II, Any World, Aja, Black Cow, Gaucho. Dirty Work, Kid Charlemagne... I could go on and on, and at no point would I get to a song from Two Against Nature. Perhaps time will prove me wrong."
2,Walter's guitar failure sinks cd,"This disc suffers from dreary guitar work by Walter Becker. The sparkling electric guitar all-star contributions that have been the jewels in the Dan's crown are missing in action.Weak-sounding and unconvincing riffs halt and stutter repetitively, ranging from blues-like to jazz-tinged. He never lifts or carries these songs, not even for a moment.Imagine Third World Man or Kid Charlemagne without the transforming and riveting Larry Carlton solos, or Bodishattva or Your Gold Teeth II without Denny Diaz's facile and melodious artistry and you get the picture.When I see the name Steely Dan, I expect emotional and technically brilliant guitar playing along with the usual smarty-pants attitude and sophisticated songwriting.Can't Walter just play bass?"
3,Way Deep Into Nothing Special,"Had this been a Donald Fagen or Walter Becker solo album, it likely would have met the same fate as ""Kamakiriad"" or ""Eleven Tracks of Whack."" But they pinned the Steely Dan moniker on it and that plopped in into the lens of a thousand microscopes and, oddly enough, the Grammy patrol. There are still some wonderful moments to be found on ""Two Against Nature,"" like the salaciously perverse ""Cousin Dupree"" and the quirky finale to ""West Of Hollywood.""""Two Against Nature"" provides plenty of the Steely Dan trademark boppy jazz pop to go around, as with the title track, and the mannered cool of ""What a Shame About Me."" For the most part, though, ""Two Against Nature"" is a recording that uses what was once innovative as a touchstone for familiarity, and works at its best for those grown-ups who feel like hip hop and techno may as well come from another planet."
2,Lifelong Steely Dan fan sez: Don't bother with this album,"I lived in California in the 70s when Fagen and Becker worked their magic. I actually wore my ""Aja"" LP out and had to buy a new one. I had high hopes for this album when it came out and I just put it on my iPod and gave it another listen. Still underwhelmed. Easy to listen to, technically precise, but where are the hooks? Each song is as forgettable as the one before. Do yourself a favor and listen to Royal Scam or Aja."
1,PATHETIC,"One of my all time favorite groups, STEELY DAN, should have ended with ""Gaucho"". The two solo albums by Donald Fagan,(The Nightfly and Kamikiriad) after ""Steeley Dan"" broke up, are awesome. But this reunion album by Steely Dan is awful. It will be very obvious to any die hard Steeley Dan fan, that all the cuts on the CD are out takes from other Steeley Dan albums.One of my favoite groups of all time, made one of the worst CD's of all times with this effort. Some groups never know when to retire, or are too greedy to do so."
2,This one is no Gaucho,"I'm a SD fan but this one's just awful! There are only 3 tracks worth mentioning: Gaslighting Abbie, Jack of Speed and West of Hollywood. The rest of time SD is just struggling for a tune. I'll give it 1 1/2 stars. If you want to listen to vintage Dan, you won't be disappointed with Aja."
2,What a dissapointment,"Sounds hollow and without emotion. Songs don't say a thing to me. Actually, they do: they sound like somebody whining about something. Love his old stuff."
1,Annus horribilus,"If this was the Best Album of the Year (according to the Grammy Awards) it must have been a really awful year. Repetitious, rambling, dull, tuneless...shall I go on? For die-hard fans only. And even they will most likely be disappointed."
1,"Insipid, pale, monochromatic and forgettable.","A disappointing and insipid and lacklustre and very forgettable CD. That was how ""Two Against Nature"" came across to me. I have long been a fan and admirer of Steely Dan but I have concluded that they reached their zenith with Aja circa 1977 and have been on a long day's journey into night ever since. It has been downhill for these erstwhile ""trend setters"" ever since. I have listened to this album a good five times trying to like it but alas, I cannot. This CD might make a good Frisbee. Steely Dan's unique combination of puckish sarcasm and satire coupled with exquisitely beautiful musical strains and melodies and arrangements were ubiquitous in their earlier albums yet are nowhere to be found in this latest work. Thank you, anyway, to Becker and Fagen for your timeless and beautiful works of the 70's. Great artists are judged more severely when they err and turn out a real stinker only because they have been so deeply respected in the past."
3,Mikey kinda likes it.,"Listening to TAN and reading reviews of the album finally solidified my thoughts on SD's newest album. Two things drew me to the group more years ago than I care to think about: 1. Their awesome fusion of rock and jazz in a way that no one else has been able to come close to, much less duplicate; and 2. The vast majority of their tunes are so melodic and more importantly, varied. They tend to stick in your head, and that's because they are fun to listen to.The present album (TAN), I finally realized, is really just one long song divided into tracks. Each cut is so much like the previous one, that it's easy to get lost unless you are listening closely. This doesn't seem to be the case with their earlier work. The great jazz is still there, and the album works very well as background music, but I doubt seriously that I will ever wake up in the morning with one of the tunes running around in my head. And to me, that is significant."
5,Steely comes through again!,"This new work is nothing but exquisite, with Steely's genius lyrical content. Fagan and Becker bridge, and cap-off the last three decades with a this brilliant new collection of jazz/funk/rock cuts! If you liked Steely Dan of yesteryears, you will surely like this one! Don't miss the lyrics on ""Cousin Dupree,"" This offering is definitely characteristic of the Steely Dan we all know and love; though, is quite new-millenium-compatible!"
4,"Kamakiriad II, plus some Aja","This disk blends pop and jazz so perfectly, you don't know where one ends and the other begins. All the songs are worthy and benefit from trademark lush production and elegant backup vocals. I sense a ""dirty old man"" theme on this disk, however. Songs such as Janie Runaway, Almost Gothic, and Cousin Dupree all have a get-the-little-young-girl theme (Too bad the Dan failed to include a jazzy sendup of ""My Sharona""). There's nothing so incisive as Black Friday, or lovely pop like Dirty Work; instead, you have well crafted pop/jazz with interesting lyrics, beautiful horns/sax, and Fagen's wry nasal musings on later life. The bottom-of-the-barrel fin-de-siecle of 11 Tracks of Whack has been softly transformed into a reminisced horniness. Bottom Line: A worth addition to your Steely Dan collection, unless you hated Kamakiriad."
5,Classic Steely Dan...,"This CD is just what the doctor ordered for us nostalgia buffs. It's classic Steely Dan...nostalgic but with a contemporary message those of us who smile when remembering the time of, Aja's ""Deacon Blues, & Black Cow"" and later, Gaucho's, ""Babylon Sisters, Third World Man, & Hey Nineteen"". It's a delicious mix of what you can only anticipate and then ultimate become sated by when Walter Becker and Donald Fagen team up in what has become the ""Steely Dan"" style...It will ultimately become a ""Must Have"" for anyone who has a Steely Dan/Donald Fagen/Walter Becker Collection. The number 4 cut, ""janie runaway"" is particularly funky. so's the first track,""gaslighting""...In fact the entire 9 track CD is quite nice. You will not be disappointed."
4,Close but not quite,"Even though this is a solid album, it lacks some of the melody and richness of sound of the previous Dan albums. There are some catchy melodies and complexities that you can only appreciate after listening to the album three or more times. But there is a sameness to each song and a lack of variety in the drum beat, which is by Dan's standards, quite repetitive. Also, many of the backing instrumentals and solos are missing the jazzy variety and richness that only artists like Larry Carlton can bring to an album. This album is close but not up to the level of other albums. But by today's standards, its still a very good album and probably a must get for any fan of Steely Dan's style of music."
4,2vN,"Wasn't expecting much from this, so had nowhere to go but up. I actually liked the between-song interviews as they highlight the offbeat humor/personalities of Becker & Fagen in real time. As for the disc, I thought the Dolby Digital 5.1 mix was ridiculous. The bass is way overdone and surround includes way too much vocal and instrument content to be considered anything close to realistic. I much preferred the 2-channel version. Also, I was disappointed at the lack of any printed information inside or any extras on the DVD menu. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the music and watching the masters at work. I'd consider it a must have for any SD fan. Gotta love those background singers--shaggadelic."
4,Great CD,"I thouroughly enjoyed this CD. Some of my purist musician friends criticize it as being very commercial - but I really enjoyed it. The sidemen, as always, shine. Chris Potter sounds great!Recommended."
4,"Welcome Back, Steely Dan!","Of course, they never really left us, but this album is excellent! One track on ""Two Against Nature"" -- West of Hollywood -- is the highlight of this CD, with a long soaring tenor sax solo from Chris Potter than is unbelievable.I've been a Steely Dan fan for almost 30 years. The first time I heard ""Dirty Work"" I was hooked, and hearing ""Rikki Don't Lose That Number"" as a friend and I moved up to college in September of 1974 imprinted that music on my brain. Now Steely Dan is the only music I listen to other than classical...I was dubious that they'd be able to continue the amazing success that they've had over the years, but Fagen and Becker proved that they deserved the Grammys that they got in February. What a wonderful work of music!!"
2,"Every song sounds the same, to bad too because they are dull",".OK,I really wanted to like this album but it was just not good in any way. A big time flop.Just to let you know, I have every Steely Dan album, plus the Citizen Steely Dan box plus 7 bootlegs of their live concerts so I am a big fan.But this album was just a bore from start to finish. Nothing interesting, nothing special, just the same old drum beat and processed Fagan sound in every dreary, lifeless offering.The only song that has even a 5% change is Gaslighting Abbey which wouldn't have made the cut on any other Dan album. And that one may be the highlight. Sad!Don't buy this record, but if you still feel the need, try to pick it up in the used rack or you can even pick up mine because I am taking it back.Never done that before with any Steely Dan work but this one just isn't worth my time. Hopefully they will return to the interesting, quirky sound that made them great."
1,wrong product,You sent me the wrong product. I ordered a cd and you sent a dvd. I am very busy and dont have the time to straighten this out at this time. please contactso I can send you back your dvd's ( yeah you sent me another one) and I can either get a refund or a CD
1,Am I missing something ?,"The songs on this album all seem to be bad copies from songs from Kamakiriad. Kamakiriad had a lot of catchy tunes. This album however deserves no credit. Hopefully none of the songs on Nature will be played on the next live tour. Of course, it is always possible that I'm simply to stupid to grasp the underying ""finesse"" of Nature."
1,whatta bummer,"if you've heard anything at all by this band, you've heard everything on this disc. when, halfway through the first cut, i started humming ""hey 19"" i knew something was wrong. this is the biggest disappointment since the eurythmics ""comeback""."
2,You can go home again guys...,"Like Gaucho, from any other band this would be a good CD--intelligent--thoughtful--and obviously a lot of work. But, after Countdown to Ecstasy, Aja, and other Dan albums, it's a letdown. I know it must be hard to go out after years of living on the laurels and craft a new and FRESH project. But as recent efforts by bands like XTC--long out of the music mill--show, you can't always go home again. I'm taking my fresh copy to the used CD store around the corner to trade for a vintage English Beat or John Coltrane CD."
3,"The Good, the Bad, and the Jazzy","I think this album is a pretty natural progression from Fagen's ""Kamakiriad"". I like ""Kamakiriad"", however it does have its critics among Dan fans. Two Against Nature has some good stuff on it. ""West of Hollywood"" is exceptional. The lyrics of ""Gaslighting Abbie"" and ""Cousin Dupree"" are typical twisted Dan lyrics that make interpretation fun. In my opinion,the weakness of this disc is the lack of lead guitar. The Dan are still mighty, but don't be mistaken,they don't rock. ""Janie Runaway"" seems like a a cheap rehash of Becker's ""Junkie Girl"" which was much more fun (Actually, so does ""Negative Girl""). The closer you are to being middle-aged (the Dan's primary market) the more you will relate to some of the songs (""What A Shame About Me"" for example). All in all, I was pleased with the disc, but not awed as I was with some of their previous efforts."
5,A great remix of an essential work,"As far as the music goes if you like Steely Dan then your going to like this disk. If your interested in how the disk sounds then all I can say is the 6 channel mix is simply incredible. I have many DVD-Audio disks but this one is best to show what the DVD-Audio format is capable of. I bought this release when it first arrived in CD format and while it was enjoyable the high resolution mix is much better. The mix really brings the music out and it's now one of my favorite disks.The remix takes maximum advantage of the DVD-Audio format. All the channels are used, unlike some mixes that avoid or abuse the center channel. The recording is exceptionally clean and punchy, which one expects from a Steely Dan recording. I definately recommend it to anyone who wants to get the most out of their 6 channel sound system."
4,Give It a Chance!,"This is not an immediately likeable album. My guess is that most people who simply give it a cursory listen are going to be disappointed simply because there are no catchy hooks or melodies that immediately reach out and grab you ala the Dan's past efforts. However, have a little patience and {listen} to it. I, too, found it a bit stiff at first and it reminded me a lot of my initial reaction to Fagan's ""Kamakiriad"". But like that album, this album's charms are subtle and before you know it this record will have its hooks in you. Trust me, if you give this album a chance, it will not disappoint you."
4,Smooth Jazz lives on!,"In my opinion, as a fan of much of Steely Dan's previous work, this CD does not disappoint. It is not filled with the trendy ""hits"" that main stream listeners may want to hear; rather, it moves in a direction that continues to defy popular trends in the music business. The sound is mature and deliciously languid and moody, unashamedly jazz. Although this CD isn't terribly commercial, the wonderfully subdued ""Jack of Speed"" has had repeated local radio play, to my delight. If you love unexpected instrumental interpretations and strong jazz performances (especially in ""West of Hollywood""), as well as smooth melodies and counterculture lyrics, this CD will not disappoint you. As a hardcore Steely Dan fan, I give ""Two Against Nature"" four stars and eagerly await their next CD."
5,Audiophiles Look Here!,"Being about 10 years old when Steely Dan was at their peak, I didn't really know any of their songs. When this album came out all I heard about it was the sound quality was amazing. Well, they were right. The sound quality recording production are top notch audiophile grade. I now use this CD as my reference when testing out equipment or showing off my gear. It has brilliant soundstage and crisp detailed highs, gut hitting lows all perfectly balanced. I suggest Jack of Speed as your go to track to see how well your equipment or headphones can sound. This CD along with The Eagles-Hell Freezes Over are the two best recorded and sounding CD's of the last 20 years. Enjoy!"
1,WHY BOTHER?,"The sound is fantastic (on DTS) but the video coverage of the band is ludicrous - full of crazy angles, wrong editing and - let's face it - it's just not a band that's great to watch no matter how it's shot/cut.But I give it one star for great DTS sound. Still, I think you'd be better off simply getting a greatest hits CD and listening to that."
1,I waited all this time for THIS?,"I'm a huge fan, I think all of the old music is brilliant. I couldn't wait until ""Two Against Nature"" was released. I couldn't have been more disappointed in the redundant songs that grinded on endlessly. Only two tracks were mildly interesting, ""Cousin Dupree"" and ""Two Against Nature"" My copy of this CD is up for sale!"
4,"Spunky, Slick, And More","Without a doubt the first highlight of the Year 2000. These sounds have very delightful jazz flavorings and some catch hooks which sink in after a few listens. This recording rocks a little more than Gaucho, which seems more appropriate as background as background music. Two Against Nature and Cousin Dupree display some high energy while maintaining some slick jazz colorings. The fade out solo on West Of Hollywood is quite ellaborate as well. Even slower tunes like Janie's Runaway work well with some stedy bass playing. Overall, this recording shows that the stylings of Steely Dan still fit in quite nicely in the new millenium."
5,Classic SteelyDan,"It exceeded my expectations. I pre-ordered before the release because I was so excited, and I haven't stopped listening since I got it."
1,"Good music, terrible video and likely on purpose","1. The one star is basically due to the poor video; ie this is a DVD and thus you're getting it for the music / video combo. Definitely get the CD version of this but this DVD is just a joke. The video seems as if it were done via some of the roadies... at the very last minute. Now the disconcerting thing is that the producers of this DVD wanted to get that... crappy video look... but yet spent a lot of money in the process. ie somewhat akin to those folks who spend a lot of money on jeans that look all beat up... but they're not... which is somehow why it's trendy?2. Steely Dan has never been about the visual performance; I mean Fagen and Becker are like two wooden men out there on stage, but their music is superb. Again, get the concert on CD because there are truly great new versions on some of their classics etc..."
2,Not a case of dynamite.,"A wholly weak and unsatisfying effort by these long-ago burned-out musicians. It's not good enough for Fagen and Becker to stay close to the old Steely Dan formula. Sure, this new stuff sounds a lot like the old stuff. So what? What is missing is any sense of inspiration or innovation in these pieces. These songs come across as pale imitations of Steely Dan tunes. They could pass for Goucho outtakes. Some of them are incredibly annoying. Janie Runaway has to be the most irritating tune I've heard in a long time.I wanted to like this CD, I really did. Unfortunately, I will soon be relegating it to the dustbin along with my Jewel CD (what was I thinking there?). This album will soon be forgotten by not just FM radio but by most of the fans currently praising it as worthy of your attention. You have been warned."
2,unsatisfied,"WellI bought this dvd with great expectations. I was let down. The performance was good but the video was a pirated copy.It came to me from Germany?! I could only watch it on my oldest player in the house. My Denon player would not allow me to watch. So, no surround sound, no flat screen. Needless to say, dont waste your money on this piece of c--p!!!"
3,ok onli,"Well by virtue of the fact that this is a comeback album, nearly 20 years after their last, it would be very much heralded by critics and fans.It is good but a little overrated by critics. The only sing-along and memorable song is the Grammy Award-winning Cousin Dupree. Other than that, the rest of the album sounds pretty much like the old stuff they were making. Not overly refreshing but none too bad."
2,Caught in a Time Warp,"For me, two groups have always defined, ""cool"": Dave Brubeck & Steeley Dan. The good news about ""Two Against Nature"" is that it's the haunting, unique, restrained quality of their music & message that set them apart from all other groups since their start. This album preserves that quality--the SD sound we've known and loved all these years; no sell-out to current musicality. The Bad News is that there seems to be little life in their new material; it's just uninspired, bland. The SD franchise is still powerful; I hope they do better next album."
4,Interesting treatment of how we perceive value,"Perhaps the most interestly aspect of this book are its insights through a series of case studies into how people perceive value in the material culture around them. The authors are fascinated by how, given some modest shifts in fit, form and function, some products will be perceived both at the point of sale and on an on-going basis as giving much more satisfaction than others. While the book is intended to be neither exhaustive nor profound, a blending of some of the methods of cultural anthropology, semiotics, and marketing offers perspectives that comparable treatments do not."
2,shameless self promotion and no new news,"this book is packed with (annoyingly repetitive) case studies that have appeared in business books for the last ten years. if you are in marketing and don't know what this book has to tell you, you shouldn't be in marketing. i saw this as a way for the Boston Consulting Group to sell themselves and their brilliant thinking (notice how chock full the book is of made-up marketing words like ""questing""). the main redeeming feature of the book are its facts and figures about American spending and economics, however NONE of the facts are sourced, cited or otherwise grounded in reality. very annoying."
4,"A solid, quick, and insightful little read.","Let's just say that after reading this book, I passed it on to my father, who loved it, and now wants me to order him multiple copies for friends. The depth of the theory is not really all that groundbreaking, but the multiple examples and conclusions they draw are worthwhile for small business owners, corporate employees, and consumers alike. Overall, a good read. The only knock I can give is its limited scope, and the repetition that develops in the later chapters."
3,Why lots of people are buying expensive stuff.,"Trading Up is a fast moving book with a time honored message about price and quality. According to Silverstein and Fiske, companies win by either creating goods that are the least expensive or the highest quality; brands in the middle are dead. In addition, the authors think almost anyone can afford ""new luxury"" brands as long as they save money by buying really cheap products too."
4,Wish I had more time.....,"I have only just started to read the book, but my time is limited so I haven't really gotten to enjoy it. But what I have read so far is great!!! I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in what makes Americans tick!"
1,best chicken base ever,"I am ninety years old and have been cooking longer than many of you have been around.I have tried every brand of chicken base, salty square ones, liquid ones and this is the only one that is CHICKEN not carrots, etc, just plain chicken. Makes a wonderful addition to stew, soup, believe it or not to beans and ham hocks, corned beef for corned beef and cabbage, (better flavor than adding beef)Being alone now, no big family I use a lot of chicken breasts, and when they are pan fried, this makes a nice touch to my gravy, no chicken fat needed, just the Minorsthank you, B. DeVault"
5,The BEST,This is the best chicken broth you can buy....it has a great taste and once you start using you you will see the difference in this product....it last a long time and stays well in the back of your fridge!
3,DOES NOT WORK ON 64-BIT VISTA,"If you don't have 64-bit Vista, this is absolutely a phenominal controller.If you do, don't buy it. They say drivers are on the way, but they've been saying that since April. I'm not convinced.Anyway, I don't mean to be negative or rude - I knew this wouldn't work with Vista 64-bit when I upgraded - I just thought anyone that didn't know should be warned."
1,No support in Windows Vista,"First, this is a really excellent product. After trying several of its competitors, I'm convinced it's the best option available for what it does. So, I'll sure miss it! It isn't compatible with Windows Vista, and according to an email from Belkin customer support on 02/07/2007, there are no drivers available, and no plans for providing any."
3,"mac users beware, if not gaming","the best aspect of this controller is being able to program macros, i.e. making one key trigger multiple events. I refer specifically to using it for non-game applications, e.g. music software, web software, etc. the windoz version allows recording of events but the mac version doesn't provide recording of a series of events but you must plug them in one by one. very 1990's. oh well. glad I did a buy-return."
4,Makes gaming easier,The speedpad makes playing online games alot easier. Just a little hard to figure out how to use at first.
2,No driver support for Mac,"After I got my N52, I found out that the software is no longer compatible with the newest Macintosh computers. A third party config program is required to get the N52 to work at all. It has great functionality, but you have to be an engineer to program the software to make it work."
4,Great for Gamers,Once you figure it how to use it it makes the gaming experience a lot better. It gives you an advantage over other gamers.
4,N52.. gamers best friend,"Everything that everyone said it would be. The only issue was that the buttons were really stiff to begin with from being new. After a few days of playing with it, they freed right up. Some said it would take a little while to get it programmed... about 15 mins. Nice contour for the hand and takes up WAY less space that a gaming keyboard. Takes a minimal time to get used to."
3,too much resistance on keys,"I bought this from amazon, opened it, and will promply sell it. I like the action of my regular logitech wireless keyboard better. The keys on the speed pad are too stiff."
1,Didn't work,"I purchased this speedpad for my husband. Although he tried a number of times, he was unable to get it to work. Neither of us would be considered ""Techies"" and maybe it required more computer expertise to install and run this. We were able to return it to Amazon easily and that part of the process was great."
5,Dependable,"I've never written a review anywhere really, but I love this device so much I feel that I have to. I don't know what other people are doing to break their units, but I've had mine ever since it came out (I guess 5 or so years ago?) and it's still going strong. I've played every game from the very first Soldier of Fortune game to F.E.A.R. It has NEVER let me down. It works great and it has never broken. I don't really mess with macros functions or anything, but the thing does have a key mapping function that's only limited by your imagination. It's a great tool and it's been a phenomenal gaming companion. A well earned 5 out of 5 stars for me."
