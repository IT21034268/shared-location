5,An Excellent Film. Well Made and Well Acted,"I would highly recommend this to all Art students. Films like this come along rarely, so take advantage. Ed Harris and Marcia Gay Harden are both quite convincing. The film is pretty much based on fact. As an artist I enjoy creativity, whether it be painting ,acting, or whatever. This film satisfies on several levels. Jackson Pollock and Willem De Kooning were both inspirational to me as a young painter. Pollock was a genius tormented, as so many great artists have been. But, don't focus on his destructive forces, focus on that magnificent body of work that he created."
3,Good - not Great,"I was hoping for more from this film.Even though Ed Harris and Marcia Gay Harden are both great in this, the film as a whole isn't that great.It's tough to put your finger on, but it lags in places and just didn't have that certain something to put it over the top.But definitely worth a watch, at least once.It's been called a vanity project for Ed Harris but so what.He remains one of our best actors.And he shines in this one."
4,"Pollock,Smallock","An excellently made film about a disgusting man who some would say is a gifted artist. Sorry, but his life exemplifies a drunkard with psychotic tendencies. The final straw is when he kills one young girl and severly injures another while taking his own life in a drunken accident. If you want two hours of drunken hypocrisy, Pollock is your bag. DRR"
4,ARTISTIC INSANITY,"One the greatest artists to live in my opinion, his creativity is only matched by his depression. This movie diplays excellent performances from Ed Harris and especially Marcia Gay Harden as ""Lee Krasner"", she brutaly shows the mental anguish ""Lee Krasner"", had to endure due to ""Pollock's"" drinking. This being a true story is also a huge plus because most true storie's do not end happily,but thats life folks. If you are a modern art fan, a fan of any art, this movie is worth watching. The deleted seens on the DVD are o.k., but not a big deal,the commentary is kind of boring and so is the making of documentary, the movie itself is the only draw here. Oh yea, I almost forgot to mention that Bud Cort is in this film, you know, from ""Harold and Maude"" fame, that alone is worth it."
2,when a great actor meets a godawful director,"ed harris was perfectly cast as artist jackson pollock. sadly, he was also the producer, and hired a horrible director. a director named ed harris. i have never before seen a movie where you could sense every damn scene being held a beat too long. over and over and over, harris keeps the camera running too long. it is as if he was so in love with his pet project (he worked on the movie for many years) that he could not bear to not put forth every single one of his notions. sad, because it couldve been a good movie."
2,"Uninteresting one-dimensional characters, interesting art","I have seen several films about Van Gogh, all which were fascinating. In each Van Gogh was a character that was portrayed in a manner that was human and who had ideas and humanity as well as a need to do art. By contrast, Harris' Pollock lacked any humanity, except for one scene where he takes a dog to a vet. And Pollock didn't seem to be someone who thought about life at all. He hardly cared about anyone and in the whole movie connected with no one with the exception of his wife, and that was far more a practical relationship than a love relationship. His wife Lee was portrayed as a generally uninteresting person as well. I was not drawn in by the film at all by any of the main characters. Pollock's gift to the world was his art; who he was and the life he lived were not worth making a movie of if this is the best the story can be told in film."
3,Interesting but frustrating,"POLLOCK focusses on the artist Jackson Pollock and his life which eventually spirals into tragic circumstances. We come to learn that Pollock is manic depressive who has the ability to change the moods of everyone around him.The film was not as engaging as I had hoped. In fact, it was quite frustrating in parts, and to be honest, I was at a loss to see what all the fuss is over his works of art. Am I missing something? His paintings were appalling, in my opinion.Ed Harris delivers a decent performance of a man whose life wasn't worth making a movie over.Yawn!"
5,"Amazing, amazing film","Jackson Pollock's life was so fascinating and came to a tragic end, but what most people don't know is Pollock's struggles and frame of mind while he was living. Ed Harris, who also directed the film, does a beautiful and complete job of letting the audience know who Pollock was. This was a man whose art was really the only outlet he had, the only way of feeling worth and truth, and Harris is such a talented actor that we can feel Pollock and side with his problems. Marcia Gay Harden delivers as well, as Pollock's wife. If you appreciate art and appreciate Pollock, see this movie. It's very worth it."
3,"A Tortured Soul, But Why?","Ed Harris portrays Jackson Pollock in this biography of the artist. Pollock was a tortured soul, no doubt. What this film does not answer, or even attempt to answer, is why? I know I might be asking too much, but I prefer a film that forwards a position. Why was he tortured? Marcia Gay Harden portrays Pollocks wife, and it is not a flattering portrayal. She comes across as difficult as Pollock. Perhaps I expect too much ""Hollywood"" from this film, but with whom am I supposed to sympathize?By the way, Val Kilmer, as always, if awful. Why does he still get roles?As for the DVD extras, the interview with Charlie Rose is interesting, even if Rose's idiosyncracies distract.The ""Making Of"" neither adds nor subtracts from the film.If you like the movie, buy the DVD, but don't expect awe-inspiring DVD extras. They are not here."
4,Transcends the Cliches of the Biopic,"Ed Harris deserved the Best Actor trophy for Pollock over the heavily hyped Russell Crowe, who should have won last year for The Insider. And I even thought there might be a chance he'd win when the sublime Marcia Gay Harden beat the equally deserving (but younger, with a brighter future) Kate Hudson.This film, based on the life and death of Jackson Pollock, is an acting paradise. Harris and Harden are both given ample scenery to chew, and Harris ups the ante by giving us a performance that not only shows the desperation and suffering in Pollock's life, but the peace he felt when he painted. And those painting scenes are so full of energy that it's easy to believe that Jackson Pollock is up there on the screen, painting yet another masterpiece.If you're a fan of Pollock himself, there will be much for you to enjoy here, and even if you're not, you'll have the chance to see two of the best performances of the year."
1,To the Right of the John Birch Society,"Good advice on investing, but I get my information from other sources. The editorial positions are reactionary, to say the least, and even as a moderate they are too biased for me. Besides, IBD's CANSLIM approach to setting stop loss orders can break you in a volatile market."
2,Dissapointing,"Have to say that I am underwhelmed by this paper. The whole investment strategy is momentum based. Every day they select the IBD ""top 50"" which purports to be those stocks that rate the highest on their selection system. However, they repeatedly advise against buying any stock that has increased by 5% or more over its chart base. However, virtually all of the stocks on the top 50 are above 5% of their breakout or they wouldn't qualify as momentum stocks in the first place. The magic moment for an IBD pick just really does not existThe system is absolutely useless in timing your buys relative to the market. A ""99"" relative strength stock is just that in a tumbling as well as a rising market. What the system is good for is picking stocks that will likely lead the pack in a solid bull market; so, its more like a good times stock picker. Rely on it for true ""investment advice"" at your peril."
3,"Useful Investment Info, But Misguided Editorializing","IBD is a useful investment tool, and Bill O'Neil's investment approach is one that a person can employ profitably.Sadly, and as other reviewers have rightly noted, IBD's editorializing is both extreme and often seems to lack a careful analysis of the facts on any given issue (the facts being our one path to the truth).Please, Bill O'Neil, when even conservative George Will can rightly criticize George W. Bush's foreign policy, when eminent scientists around the world state that it is 90% certain that humans are warming the planet, etc., don't stick your head in the sand and deny reality. Such positions are askew of the facts and reflect, too often, a selfish posture.A more careful analysis of reality would lead to more tempered editorials (in most cases) and a more esteemed publication. Here's hoping that IBD moves in that direction."
5,Essential for the Individual Investor,"You need to read IBD if you invest in stocks. It's a unique and must-read newspaper for an individual investor. It is filled with solid information about stock and company characteristics. It focuses on market areas targeted to small investors. It's totally different from WSJ, broker resources and other investment news options. IBD is designed around a specific investment method, so once you understand the method the information is particularly easy to assimilate. The usefulness of the information is adaptable to many investment styles, such as those implementing Jim Cramer's rules. Just a few of its daily columns are worth the price of a subscription.What about the op-ed views? If you're a libertarian or libertarian-conservative, you'll appreciate IBD's perspective. You won't agree all the time, but it's op-eds are well-informed and thought provoking. You can ignore the op-eds if you're uncomfortable with liberty and prefer a more statist approach."
2,Right Wing Propaganda,"I just canceled the subscription I had. The tools are OK, but the right wing constant rhetorical diatribes are just nauseating to say the least. If I wanted these views I would listen to Rush Limbaugh Or Sean Hannity who sometimes seem moderate to the obvious biases."
1,Bait and switch - don't subscribe,"I signed up for the free trial with no problem. Even went to a user group workshop. When I called the subscriber desk I got a price quoted for the online, the physical paper delivery and a ""free"" book. They took my credit card number and told me I could go online immediately and start using the service and the physical paper would be there on Tuesday. I had called on a Thursday.After running into problems getting online, I called Gary again and was given the run-around on my subscription and was told I didn't know what I had ordered, but if I paid more money I could actually get what I ordered the first time OR I could get a full refund. Hopefully I won't have a problem with that. Caveat Emptor!!!"
1,Good Investment Guide but severe right wing political views,"This is a very good resource for investing but unfortunately the editorials, especially the Issue & Insights section, is written by extreme right wing radicals. They might as well have Ann Coulter or Gordon Liddy writing their columns. This part of the paper has been a huge disappointment. The majority of Americans don't view themselves with the extreme right or left side of the political process. I can't understand why this investor's resource would sell themselves to one extreme. I simply can no longer support either radical views and I don't want to spend this type of money on a paper that is so extreme. The right winged editorials compromise the value of their product. I have no idea why this would be necessary in an investor's guide. Do yourself a favor and find an alternative investor resource guide that is far less political. There are many out there and most of them cost less or are free."
4,Great investing criteria......but!!,"I've owned an IBD subscription for the past 2 years and it's sage advice for investing in stocks is excellent. I especiallyfollow the IBD 50 every weekend to figure out the stocks to buy , if any, the following week. You will make $$$ if you follow their rules.Unfortunately there is a down side to all of this and as a previous reviewer mentioned their editorial pages are opinions that I steer clear of. It's not just conservative but rabid right wing in my honest opinion.But let's not spoil what is good about this newspaper, and their analysis of the stock market can't be beat. Just be aware of their rather radical political viewpoints."
3,Good Stock Newspaper but very reactionary,"This is a good newspaper with TONS of financial data on individual stocks. But their recommendations are typically very reactionary and are pure momentum picks(where the stock has already appreciated substantially). Rarely are there any sort of contrarian picks or stock that have not already moved a good percentage in price.Also, as has been mentioned before, their editorials are so right-wing that it makes for nothing more than sensational comedy."
3,"Great content, but book quality may not be consistent","I read the book and based on the content I would have kept the book because it is really a cute story. However, the pages had black smudge print on it. I don't think this would've made a difference to my baby niece, but I just didn't feel good about giving it to her so I am going to return it"
3,Slightly dissapointed,"I really like the Potty book by Leslie Patricelli so when I saw there was a Binky book we jumped on it. However, I was dissapointed. I had hoped that the book would instill positive emotions about giving up the binky and/or accepting that the binky phase was behind us, instead the character is obsessively looking for the binky, has a tantrum and is only soothed once the binky is relocated. I don't need a book that relives my current situation, but rather one that provides an alternative narrative for my daughter so she can see other perspectives.We read it, but not with the same enthusiasm as Potty, which is a proactive approach to going through potty training. I had hoped that Binky would also be such a constructive book."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I love all Leslie Patricelli books and we didn't have this one yet. I had never read the book before, but just assumed it would be great like the others. Most books I have read on ""binkies"" is usually about getting rid of it, this is not. It is all about searching the house for it, and eventually finding it in his crib. So if you are like me and wanted a book to help get rid of the binky, this is not the book. Otherwise like I said all Leslie Patricelli books are great."
5,We love this author!,"We've got this one and the Yummy Yucky one. the pictures are bright and colorful, and theres few enough words on the page to hold a 9 month olds attention.my daughter is 12 months now and still loves reading this one. we're going to buy her all the board books this author has."
3,First Half Works Well,"These work beautifully in office work, neatly and easily whiting out whatever you want to write/type over.They're also very handy for editing a basically good book that has things you'd like to change or delete: bad grammar or syntax, typos, redundancy, porn or vulgarity, politics, religion, or anything else you don't really want to be beaten over the head with in a novel, etc. Editing your own books can be kind of fun.No matter what you're using it for, however, about half-way thru the tape it starts to get temperamental. Sometimes it works smoothly and sometimes it takes some effort to get them started. I've come to the conclusion that, since they're not too expensive, I'll just get extras and pitch them once they start to act up, because I really do like them- when they're working."
1,Defective Product,"Not worth the money. Invest in a better quality product. These reviews are spot on. Nonsense,drivel,refuse,rubbish,junk. Get it? Do not waste your time."
1,Not designed for left handers,"In this ""improved"" set up, you have to hold the roller in your right hand, unlike the previous design, which was usable for both right handed and left handed people."
1,Terrible. Just terrible.,"This is an awful design. Tape loosens almost immediately,the used portion does not get pulled up well enough leaving a loop hanging in the front, tape comes off the ""track"" and NO WAY TO TIGHTEN! After one use, product is rendered useless. I cannot believe that the tension is not adjustable. Tried to take unit apart and wind that way, after 10 minutes of wasted effort and prolific cursing I just had to throw it away. Oh, and the white correction medium, does not stick to the freakin' paper! Which is its only purpose. This is just bad, bad, bad."
1,Will never buy again,"I purchased these tapes to replace some old BIC whiteout tapes which I used up. Well, the ""New and Improved"" (from the package) is that they SUCK!It is hard to explain, but the tape doesn't come out of the dispenser properly and leads to tears/holes in the tape. If you try to run the tape over the top of it again... it just makes a mess.These things finally provided to be a bigger pain in the butt than anything and earned a one way trip into the waste basket.Bottom line, unless BIC un-""Improves"" these things... I'd go with another brand."
1,Poor quality,This is a poor quality item. The tape has broken on both that were purchased. The roller is weak and so it does not apply well.
3,"Pretty good, but doesn't want to stick sometimes","Bic Wite Out tape is pretty good, the casing is one of the best I've used (much better than those elongated ones) however the tape doesn't want to stick to paper at times. After every use you have to press down on the tape to make it adhere to the paper well because it just won't stick otherwise. One plus is that it lasts a long time though. I use this at work all the time and have some at my home (no I didn't steal them from work) and the one I own has lasted over a year."
1,Waste of money,The tape came loose early on after one or two uses and basically became USELESS. Once the tape is looped out like that there is no fixing it.I had to throw it away with 95% of it unused.Not a happy customer.
1,Bad quality product.,Trust the reviews: this is not a good product. I just open my order and one of them is defective. Do yourself a favor: don't buy this. Spend a couple of dollars more getting a better quality product and you won't regret.
1,Don't buy Bic wite-out!!!!,Both rolls malfunctioned immediately. The tape became loose with a huge loop coming out of the front end. Don't waste your money. The low price matched the low quality.
3,Wite-Out,"Rolls out smoothly. However, laying it on it's side after years of using one that stand up, makes using this product a little difficult."
1,Waste of money,"I can't believe that this product is on the market. It doesn't work. With both dispenser the tape got loose right away. I took one of the dispensers apart, tightened the tape and put it back together, and the tape immediately got loose again."
1,TERRIBLE Product,"Don't waste your money on this product, even if it's only $3, you'll only get frustrated using this. Just as many other reviewers mentioned, within a minute or so of use, the tape comes off of its track so that the used tape does NOT roll back into the cannister and just creates a loopy mess. I refuse to waste my time trying to fix a defectively designed product. SHAME ON BIC for continuing to sell this product KNOWING FULL WELL it is just ripping people off. Spend the $3 on an icecream, you'll feel more happy!"
3,"It is white out, what more could you expect?","It is white out and that is that. not very high quality either, so be careful when you are whiting out something because the clear tape could break easily... should have just went to staples. LOL I guess I did get it in 2 days so I cannot complain."
1,THis doesn't even work...,BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY... can't even get it stick. BIC u suck never buying ur products ever again... go die in a hole. TY Peace
1,Crappy,Poor quality. Both tapes rolled off the track within a couple of uses and I couldn't get it aligned again. Terrible design.
1,Bic Wite-Out Correction Tape,"I'd like to figure out how to give less than 1 star. I've tried it more times then I care to say and spent too much money on such an inferior product. I'm going back to liquid White Out, at least it's consistant. I have at least 5 of the tape rollers that only worked once, and then the tape gets off track and it becomes useless. I am now stuck with these full cartridges of correction tape that do NOT work. Don't waste your time and money, you'll end up frustrated and throwing them away. I thought I wasn't using it correctly and kept purchasing more, turns out it's not me or you it's the dispenser, it just does not work."
2,"Tape works great, but not worth the pain","At first I thought it was just me who couldn't follow directions on the package, and could successfully apply the correction tape only about 30% of the time. Then the tape promptly failed to roll properly and formed a backlog of used tape outside the unit. Now that I see the other unhappy reviews, I'm glad I am not alone.The correction tape works great, but the mechanism is worthless, and I spent way too much time trying to get it to work."
2,Works...sorta,"When the tape isn't tangled, or torn, this white-out tape works fine. You can write on it without smudging and it covers up your errors...that being said, I take class notes in pen and I spend about 75% of the time ripping this thing open and de-tangling it, or putting it back on it's track. It is quite frustrating. I threw away the first one and had the same problem with the second and so, threw that one away as well. I will never buy this product again."
1,worthless,This is a worthless product. Don't buy it. The first time I used it the tape stuck to the paper. When the dispenser was pulled back the tape came with it. There is no mechanism to wind the tape back up. So the entire roll was unuseable. I will boycott all of BIC products in the future.
1,"Awful...they break, they snag, and they are expensive","My office purchased these for me. Within 3 weeks, all three (packs, as in SIX tapes) were unusable or broken. The tape breaks, the ribbon loses 'slack' and cannot be tightened, and the white out product on the tape is low quality. There is nothing good about these. Having since been purchased three other white out tape brands, I can honestly say this is perhaps the worst product on the market. You could not PAY me to use it again. Avoid. As an alternative, consider the Liquid Paper DryLine Grip, which has become a favorite in our office."
4,Office products that help,This makes a nice cover on a page as opposed to wite out liquids that sometimes dry hard and useless. It's neat also. The only thing I would like to see perfected on this product would be that at times the tape gets off track and doesn't work.
3,Great....until the tape goes loose.,This product was working perfectly --until the tape started to come loose & slack got fed into the wrong wheel & it wouldn't work anymore.
1,new design no good!,I HATE THE NEW DESIGN ON THE WITE OUT. THE WITE OUT BEATS THE LIQUID BY A FIVE STAR RATING BUT THE NEW DESIGN FROM THE OLD ELONGATED IS NO GOOD. I PURCHASED A PKG OF THESE AND ON THE FIRST TWO THAT I TRIED THE TAPE DID NOT SEPARATE FROM THE BACKING AND I HAD ABOUT 2 INCHES OF MESS THAT I COULDN'T GET BACK IN THE CONTAINER. SAME THING HAPPENED ON THE NEXT ONE. I WILL NO LONGER PURCHASE THE BIC BRAND AND WILL PURCHASE ANY OFFICE STORE BRAND THAT HAS THE OLD DESIGN.
1,Self-winding does not work,"The tape works fine until it becomes loose and then it's worthless. The packaging indicates it has a self-winding mechanism, but it has never worked for me. Inevitably, wound up throwing away both with more than half the tape on because it became loose. I will never buy this again."
1,Terrible,"This stuff is the worst. Doesn't stick properly, doesn't tear easily, causes an awful mess and a lot of trouble. After attempting to use it this past time I have decided to just throw it away."
1,"inefficient product, waste of money","this new EZcorrect white-out dispenser is completely inefficient, and here is why:1. when you release the tape from the paper after correcting something, a piece of tape sticks out from the tip EVERY SINGLE TIME - which means that each time you use it after that you get an extra piece of loose tape crunched up right in front of the word you are trying to white-out.2. the tip of the dispenser is so hard and stiff that when you go over an already-corrected area, it scratches off the tape that was previously applied. [the old dispenser did not do that even if the tape wasn't dry]3. the tip of the dispenser is too wide and makes the use inaccurate and awkward.what a terrible product! the old design worked much better. this is a major redesign FAIL for bic.now where do i buy the old tapes?"
5,Read this book!,"This is a truly remarkable book which gives a balanced view of youth sports today. Dr. Murphy is exactly right, in my opinion, in laying the blame for what problems exist squarely at the feet of the adults. He does an excellent job of analyzing what's good and bad about the roles of coaches and parents. He recommends specific and reasonable ways to keep what's good and minimize what isn't. I'm a coach and league director and chair national meetings on youth sports. I repeated recommend this book to everyone I know in youth sports."
3,"fine, bulky","useful, but not easy to take around with you. Also, there are not color differences in the ink which makes quick finding/viewing more difficult."
2,Not for me,I gave this two stars because the fit and finish is fantastic. Practically this didn't work for me. I'm slim/athletic build and was no way I could hide this huge holster and gun under my tucked in shirt w no jacket.
4,"Great product, but needs simple instructions about lens changes","I've owned/used NYX glasses for several years. I got this set for my wife. The style is a bit different from the one I have, and we were puzzled at first as to how to interchange lens (on mine, it's easy; on her's, it's different and a bit more complicated). I wish a simple set of instructions had come with it. But our teenage son solved the puzzle and now we know. Otherwise, this is a great product and value. My wife uses her glasses for tennis. I use mine for tennis officiating."
3,No attempt to control vocabulary,"I have to be fair and admit that I haven't spent the time with this book/tape set to do it justice. However, I found this book incredibly frustrating. That's because it seems no effort was made to present vocabulary in an orderly, controlled manner. They might use a word in Lesson 2 but not bother to list it as new vocabulary until Lesson 4. A dictionary is an absolute must to do any of the exercises. Also, not all the taped exercises are transcribed in the book, or at least it's not 100% clear how they correspond, so I keep finding words in those that I don't quite understand and can't look up. It's a so-so book/tape combo, but only so-so. I love to dabble in languages, and I've definitely seen better."
3,A good basic introduction with a few flaws...,"While I did find that this book was comprehensive in its introduction of useful, relevent vocabulary, and had a good audio companion, I found that some of the exercizes in the book lacked answer keys, making it occasionally frustrating. I would generally recommend it, but I would also recommend purchasing a companion volume that covers Indonesian grammar, and/or a good dictionary with a section devoted to it."
2,Disappointed and Frustrated,"Well, I must agree with some of the earlier reviews. I bought the book and CDs to help me learn to speak some Indonesian before a trip to Bali. It's way too complicated and hard to follow for the average person and the CDs were a frustrating waste of time, at least for me. The CD would start with material from the book and then go off on stuff that I didn't understand because it did not follow the book material. I guess it would be fine for a formal course in a college setting, where you have the professor making the connections and you were doing tons of homework, but for the average person trying to get learn some language basics, I would not recommend it. And the book plus the CDs was a priceypackage. I found better lessons, easier to follow, and more useful on the web for free. Don't waste the money."
4,Learning indonesian,I have been traveling sporadically to Indonesia since 10 years ago. I tried many books to learn a basic Indonesian and I can tell you this is the best one with a great difference over the rest. It is very well organized and drives you from very easy concepts up to the most complicated following a very smooth path.
5,Must Read for Everyone,"This book not only presents a real world solution of advocacy for parenting; but also for professionals, relatives, and others who really need to know the right questions to ask before forming opinions."
3,Needed For Class,"I have to be honest, I barely used the book. I hope I pass the class exam. xD The book was in great condition though."
1,Well Herman Brown,"Sorry my man, but I have heard lot's of reggae, either live (US, Jamaica, and Mexico) CD's or DVD's, and really, if you consider this DVD as getting you back to real reggae. well, sorry again, where do you leave the 70's and the first half of the 80's? I still think this DVD is only worth 1 star. For other reggae lovers, just check other reggae DVD's, there are many to choose, start with those two of Gregory Isaacs, the one by Don Carlos, there is also Culture, Israel Vibration, Bob Marley, The Wailers, etc."
2,Quick shipping!,"The seller shipped this item very quickly. However, even though it was ""extra large"" it was way smaller than I thought it would be and had to ship it back. I would definitely buy from this seller again."
4,The only thing good about this album is the basslines.,"The vocals are annyoing, the lryics need work. but man, that bassplayer is amazing!Corey Grashel is a bassist I will be following for life."
4,Excellent protection for those tough on their Treo's,"I have used this case now for about 6 months and it's still holding up, my Treo looks great. The hing is getting a little raty and wiggles alot, and the case has actually gotten harder to open, but its doing its job admirably. I went with the soft version of some armor/shield product (it was the clear plastic stuff), but the beast still died after about 10 months of use and i'm sure it was related to more crushing damage as opposed to scaps or drops. I recommend this case if you are active or have it attached to your hip."
2,good,"Quality is good, purse size was smaller than I thought it would be but the demensions were given. Not enough pocket space per my mother-n-law, who's gift it was. I got it for her last Christmas and she rarely uses it as it is ""too small"" and straps are too short for comfortable carrying."
1,This dictionary could be better..,"This is an average dictionary that covers nothing more than some computer security terms..My Rating for this book would be average, but good for a IT Security beginner."
1,Mislabeled file.,"Check the sample - this is an eight dollar copy/paste of the free Project Gutenberg ebook for the Jargon File, elsewhere on the Kindle store for under a buck in better quality."
1,Not Worth the Shipping Cost,This book is misleading from it's title to it's content. One would think that the terms introduced would be little known except for int the hacker world but no!! These terms were copy and pasted from some third-party source and I care not to mention it. Don't waste your money on such worthless trash. The two people who gave this crap a 5-star review are probably affiliated with the author.
1,"Warning-This is not ""The Complete Warner Bros. Recordings""","I have notified amazon & retailers, this item is mislabeled.Make sure you check the image, when buying this disc.The yellow album cover is on The Warner Bros. Masters Series.It only has 3 tracks(it should be called the worst of Mwandishi).The real ""The Complete Warner Bros. Recordings"" will have a mostly white album cover, with Herbie smiling while holding an umbrella. The Real Complete Recordings, has 13 tracks and includes the complete Fat Albert Rotunda.You will know it is The Complete Recordings because it has 3 albums on 2 discs(13 tracks).It is available on amazon.I made the mistake of ordering the lower priced disc, and it took 2 months and several attempts before I could get a refund."
4,Get Real!,"This book does a job of portraying prayer for exactly what it is: an expression of yourself to God. It encourages us to drop the pretenses and to be our real selves with the Father. Now, that's a pretty liberating concept!The book is presented in three parts: 1) Praying with Your Hurts 2) Praying with Your Sinfulness and 3) Praying with Your Misfortunes, Fears and Frustrations. Each section breaks these categories down even further into specific areas and shows us how we often allow the very things we want and need to deal with and prayer to become the stumbling blocks that keep us from prayer.The author is obviously writing not only from inspired knowledge, but from having been down the road of ""getting real"" in her own prayer and spiritual life. I found it encouraging and uplifting as well as a helpful aid in stripping away the unrecognized insincerity that is so often present in our relationship with God."
3,One night stand,"This costume was definitely a huge hit. Not to say that I was completely satisfied with the quality of the product. The item pictured appears to be much more solid than it actually is. It is made of a flimsy material. However, I lined the costume with cardboard which gave it solid form and made it much more realistic looking. The hat had to be ironed and heavily starched so that it would keep it's form."
4,Fun costume.,I got a lot of attention with this costume. I did wear pants with it though. Halloween in Canada is not warm enough to go without.
4,Hit of the party!,I wore this to a Halloween party and won a prize for one of the best costumes! It was definitely a conversation starter! Very light weight and decent soft polyester material. Art work is very realistic. Definitely recommend.
3,Greenies are better,"My dogs will aeat just about anything, but they don't eat these with gusto, and I can't tell a marked difference when they do.I still think Greenies are way better than these fir their teeth and breath, and my three dogs think so too."
3,Limited by author's bias,"The author does a good job in asserting his basic premise, that we can live longer and better by the choices and actions we make.He uses the obvious gimmick of stating 100 steps to reaching 100, this results in a lot of filler, fluff, redundancy and repetition. The book would have been better if he simply stated his advice clearly and concisely.His biggest failure is that he makes no mention of spirituality and religion as a factor in achieving a long life. The studies on this are conclusive, spirituality and religion aids in achieving a long and fulfilled life. The author's makes a few sneering remarks about unnecessary ""metaphysics"". Clearly he has let his personal anti-religious bias interfere with his work.Despite the limitations, this books is a useful one if it gets people thinking and acting to achieve a long and productive life. To work out a specific personal game plan, look for more informative books on diet and exercise."
2,Very Nude but not very Yoga,"I can't judge the Tai Chi but the Yoga in this video was not well done. The producers hired attractive women with gorgeous bodies and large breasts--but no Yoga skills. So this video does not combine the beauty of Yoga with the beauty of the human body. It would be absolutely wonderful to have a talented and flexible Yoga instructor do Yoga postures correctly...and in a manner that is intentionally sexually explicit and erotic. I don't see any problem with that. Probably few if any dedicated Yoga instructors would consider doing that sort of video. I'm sure it would be frowned upon by the serious Yoga community which might consider it degrading. So we end up with a second rate product like this video. Too bad. Nevertheless, I do enjoy watching these women show us their bodies."
1,Pathetic,"I first viewed this as a VHS about three years ago as part of a research project. Not only is the Tai-Chi and Yoga useless, and the girls completely ineptÑthe girls also spend most of their time covering their genitals with their hands whenever they go into an open-legged squating position as if they are frightened and embarrassed by what they are doing. If the DVD is the same low-quality production as the VHS, I would not waste my time and money."
2,"Nude and entertaining, but strange","It is totally nude and therefore has a lot of entertainment value. I guess my biggest complaint (and I can really only comment on the yoga since I am not a regular tai chi practitioner) is that the women have fake breasts -- this is rather contrary to the overall yoga philosophy, is it not?! I guess if they were real they'd bounce too much, but I thought it was inappropriate/ridiculous. Also, they wear socks (not those funky special yoga socks, but just regular socks). Socks are a big no no in yoga! The women didn't otherwise appear to be cold, so why they were wearing the socks was a total mystery. But the oddities also make this fun/funny to watch."
3,Great for my fitness collection,"Two separate fitness programs on this DVD. Yoga and Tai Chi. Very nice to learn this on my TV with seven buck naked ladies teaching these classes. They show the careful moves, positions and breathing techniques like the sun salutation and the half spinal twist. The yoga ladies are attractive, skilled and limber. The tai chi ladies are very lovely to view in motion, but not as talented. The music and voice narration is relaxing, soothing and very informative even for new folks like me. Not x rated but erotic to see. In my opinion, this production is just as good as any other yoga fitness program. Plus hey, their all fully nude. Works for me. Fun to participate or just watch. Unlike with a vhs tape, these workouts can be further enjoyed with the DVD interactive menus and instant chapter access. Cool way to learn yoga."
4,Good selection of poses,"I bought the VHS tape of Nude Yoga in 1999, and that was my first introduction to yoga. Since then I have started to take classes with yoga instructors, and I am very impressed with the selection of poses that were chosen for the video. It is true that the women in the video have not all mastered the poses, and it's just wrong for the one woman to have socks on. I'm also not real sure why the progam had to be nude. A one piece leotard would have sufficed, and the video doesn't seem like it's trying to be sexy, so what was the point of the nudity? ANyway, I have come to igonore the nudity and enjoy the poses. There is a very good selection of basic and difficult poses (except that there are no warrior poses), and the narrator explains the benefits from the poses. I really enjoy this program."
4,Ahhhhh it's like a yin and yang,"I find this DVD to be very relaxing. The models are hot and very naked...which is why one would purchase this DVD to beging with. I am calm and at peace with the universe watching this. Freeze frame and zoom can give an extra kick, howerver it is not really necessary. Light a candle, smoke something, maybe illegal (I didn't say that) and enjoy. Shaving certain hair is so very proper. Go to sleep or wake up to this one and your dreams or your day will go a lot better."
1,NUDE and loving it!,"I live in Danville, CA, and have yet to find a local yoga class as stimulating as this video! I was once a fan of the RICHARD SIMMONS, sweating to the oldies, but this is much more relaxing and harmonious. I feel like this is the new new thing of the new new age! This is fun, really fun. Plus, everyone's NAKED. I mean, you can't get any more natural than that! I'd also like to mention, that in addition to hanging out at local coffee shops, I spend most of my free time researching things like YOGA, and SOUL NUMBERS, as well as astrology and TAI CHI. But nothing has come close to satisfying my new age cravings like NUDE YOGA. Really, I would watch this tape even if I didn't do yoga!"
2,Could be better,"This video was made about 10 years ago. The models do not appear to be enthusiasts of either Tai Chi or Yoga, as none of the models seem to be instructor quality. All the instruction is provided in VO. The instructions do not give a complete routine or even provide transition for most of the moves.Gets a 0 for instructional qualityGets a 1 for production valueGets a 1 for quality of intstructors/modelsGets a 1 for camera workGets a 4 for the concept.With the popularity of these exercise methods growing, increased popularity in nude yoga specifically, I would think there is a great market for this video to be remade and remade properly."
3,could be a LOT better,"Again, this is a great concept. What could be better than watching hot nude women do yoga anyway? The yoga section is pretty good, though it's old and the women are mostly silicone. Think bargain bin porno with all the nudity and none of the sex. The tai chi section is just bad. Look for a deal on the VHS nude yoga. The video transfer of that is pretty bad anyway."
1,What was I expecting?,"This is important because there is an expectation for the product. I was considering a pure look at yoga and Tai Chi. The first glimpse at fake large breast caused me to turn it off. My expectations were not met with this product. It is hard to think of a pure science of the body without the expectancy that the people would love their bodies enough not to appear to change them to impress the masses. For me the appearance of large fake breast stopped my look at this product. If they are not pure yoga practitioners, set above the norm, then this cannot be taken seriously, but more in a light porn category to me. This maybe an incorrect assumption but it does show that perception is directly tied to expectations."
2,Not so good!,"The models are not accomplished students of either yoga or Tai Chi. The product looks like a home movie; the set, soundtrack and voice over are poor quality. After viewing Nude Yoga and Tai Chi I placed it in our recycle bin. Thanks"
4,Great reference book for collectors,One of the best books on the subject. Weak area is china from areas other than Britain.
5,Great Flow Blue Reference Book,The author has done her homework with this book of flow blue items. It's easy to follow and very well put together. Great reference book - great reading!!
1,find something better,Product does not clean the air as well as they claim. Cannot even tell if the ionizer is working properly since I do not sense any difference in air quality like I could with others I have used in the past.
5,"Outstanding reflections on relationships that stands head,","heart and all well above the simplistic pap, sap and crap that books about Venus and Mars blather on about. This book is elegant, thoughtful, deeply moving and graceful -- unlike so much modern claptrap. This is a keeper, which I am currently rereading for the 6th time or so and look forward to doing many more times because of it's ageless wisdom."
1,Some Men are More Perfect Than Others,"A horrible little book. Don't waste your energy trying to obtain or read this trite book. I was expecting something insightful in this book. Instead a found a shallow book that could have been written in the 1800's. I can't believe this was recommended to me, it makes me concerned about the woman who recommended it!"
3,Not my favorite Herbie Hancock album...,"I have to start by saying, I am a HUGE fan of Herbie Hancock. Personally, I think he is an American treasure. That said, other than one or two songs, this album fell well short of what I typically love about Herbie Hancock music. The music on this album is generally too funkadelic, too not-timeless, and not enough beautiful jazz for my taste, except for one or two songs. Sorry Herbie, but this album just didn't do it for me..."
3,Red Krayola - 'Japan In Paris in L.A.' (Drag City),"Decent live audio document of Red Krayola's tour of Japan in March, 2005. Main downside is the duration of this disc is a mere 31:50. First half of this CD is a bit too out-there for me but all is not lost - the last four tracks here make this title all worthwhile. Liked ""The Surrealist Dream No.2"", ""Storm Sequence"", the almost seven-minute tripping ""The Green Gun"" and ""Death Of A Painter"". Heard that Mayo Thompson and company did a six date U.S. tour not too long ago. Can't believe this Texas psychedelic / Avant Garde band is even still in existence. More power to 'em."
1,No download instructions,"I am trying to purchase this item, and there are no instructions to download. You can't just add to your cart and download it that way. It says there are instructions on the item page and there are not. Lame."
3,"Average game, no dazzling effects","This is pretty much every other madden game. I was not impressed with the menu screen at all. It was very confusing to even save a game or load a character. The gameplay itself was repetitive. I hope Xbox 360 comes out with a patch for ESPN 2K5, because that game had it all. Madden maybe worth $50 retail, but thats even stretching it."
4,"A Good game, Superstar mode is well worth the price alone",Great graphics and a good AI make this game alot of fun. Playing as a single player in superstar mode is unique and alot of fun at many positions. I thoughly enjoyed blocking and I never expected than to be something I enjoyed in a football game.Worth the purchase!
3,Not The Best,"Ok here is the laydown without just ranting about the quality of the game. To be honest I felt the game was just NCAA Football 2007, but just with NFL teams instead. The graphics are great if you have a smaller LCD Tv, but if you have a big 62' the quality of the graphics decline.The Gameplay to me is average. I thought that this years edition had a better grasp of football than last years edition, saying that this years edition is an improvement. In the end though you, to me it seemed you will spend more time simulating then actually playing.One of the new added gametypes is the SuperStar mode. Sadly though this comes up far short, and you will most likly just stick with the Franchise mode.I hope this review has helped you a little in your decision, below are the rating's out of ten i gave the game.Graphics... 7.5/10Sound...... 6/10Gameplay... 6.5/10Replay..... 7/10Overall.... 6.75/10"
2,MADDEN has SUCKED since 2002 edition. I think they are using the same graphics engine too.,What a piece of garbage. I bought the collector's edition and took it back after a week. I lost 20 bucks but didn't care. Madden 2008 will be as bad as well because they are still using the same graphics engine that they have since the Xbox days. Terrible series.
2,EA doesn't understand XBox Live,"This is my son's favorite game, and of course he'd like to play it online as well. But EA is ignoring the parental control settings in XBox live and implementing it's own rules. If you're less then 13 years and were honest on your age, they block your gamertag permanently.I contacted their support, and they suggested I create a new gamertag and lie about his age. What a great way to show that you're concerned about safe online play. Instead of using the controls provided just for that reason, they encourage you to subvert them. Obviously they're more concerned about their legal liability then providing safe and fun gameplay."
2,"Good for some, not others...","There are two different types of Madden player. Some go for accurate simulation and detail, others go for creativity and solid presentation. If your likings fall under the latter of the two, prepare to be bitterly disappointed.Sure, it is true that the gameplay is amazing. Player likenesses are unmistakeable and the action is great. However, those of us who want more from their Madden find this game to be empty and gutless. There is no Create-a-team, create a stadium, or create a fan feature that has been such a great part of the recent current-gen Madden games. The 'create player' function is a joke, and franchise mode has VERY little to offer. You can find all of these features by picking up the game for 10 or 20 dollars less on the PS2, XBOX, or Gamecube. 360 fans deserve better."
1,"Fun, but crashes - beware!","I don't normally play sports games, so I won't bother reviewing the gameplay.However - this game, and a few other EA games we own for the Xbox 360, crash constantly. I have read various threads on the 360 forums where people are experiencing the same problems, and read a ton of reviews here about the game crashing.I have this to say to MS/EA:1. Thanks for letting us CHOOSE a game publisher for football. We're STUCK with this crappy, crashing version.2. How can you sell a Madden game and not have Madden's comments during gameplay?I have this to say to those that wish to check this out:RENT IT FIRST. If the game crashes, you will likely have the same problem with any other DVD you find. Hopefully, your 360 isn't worthless for EA games like ours is becoming. This is just one reason why I am fumed about this and NCAA 07. We DON'T HAVE A CHOICE FOR ANOTHER GAME. Thanks a lot, EA.Perhaps an ESPN version wouldn't crash."
1,Worst fears confirmed.,"I thought when EA got the exclusive license for the NFL, that the creative process in developing their next Madden game might decline, I mean why strive for a great football game when you have the only NFL game on the market, and you know people will buy it.This isn't a good football game, and you know what? There's nothing we can do about it."
1,get this for xbox,"wow. what a disappointment. my biggest complaint is no fantasy drafts, because that was one of the funnest things to do on 06. and as for new features on 07, all its got is 'madden gamer level' (ooo wow) and you can control linemen when your player is rushing. is that all they could come up with? im pissed i wasted my money on the 360 version, the only thing i enjoy about this game is playing as rookies like reggie bush and vince young. if you have the option to get it for xbox, do it. xbox has fantasy drafts and all the same players, who cares if the graphics arent as good if the game isnt even fun."
3,It's just okay.,"I purchased Madden 07 for the 360 thinking it may be a big improvement over the ps2 version. Boy was I wrong. While the game does look better on the 360, it is the same old madden.First of all it runs very choppy at times. I don't know why this is. I guess the people over at EA once again put half the work into it because it is not the PS2.Second online is terrible. I have not yet played one game that did not lag. I am not the only person to experience this, as I have talked to other gamers I have played.Having said this it is just an average football game. Nothing about it stands out. Which is a shame because madden a next gen system really could have been something.I may not be buying Madden next year, unless there are some major changes."
2,R U Kiddin' ME???,"Just finished this game and finally won the SUPEBOWL. WHAT THE HECK HAPPEND!!! EA is GETTING SOOOOO CHEAP!!! WHERE THE HECK IS THE CELEBRATION AFTER WINNING THE BIG GAME!!!!. You win...and the game just moves on to the PROBOWL. That is soooo stupid!! C'mon EA, at least have a POT OF GOLD at the end of the RAINBOW... Don't buy this game!!! 06 is just as good and even cheaper. EA is getting worse and worse...."
2,Over hyped and not enough grunt,The graphics are amazing. Yes that I will give the lastest version of madden. But where the Graphics win the game play suffers. I personally think EA's lock on football is going to turn a lot of people off the game. I just think EA if you have a lock you should do better and not offer up something like 07. Give us proof you wanna make quality and not a fast buck. Keep trying because this one isn;t cutting it.
1,What A Disappointment!,"Save your money. EA has done in the fans of the 360 again. Madden 06 was garbage, and Madden 07 is only a little better. The graphics are good, but the gameplay is bad for a next-gen system. The extra features, that fans have come to love, are missing or outright horrible. I fault the exclusive deal that EA signed with the NFL. Since there is no competition, EA can just do little and collect money off of little work and broken promises. Again, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,Disappointing to a long-time Madden fan...,"I made the jump from Sony's PlayStation to the XBox 360 last summer. I skipped out on the interim generation of consoles -- as a student, I couldn't justify the cost. I had almost every Madden title out there for the PlayStation, and so I did the same with Madden NFL 07 on the 360.I was, to put it nicely, displeased. Madden NFL 07 actually made me want my PlayStation back. Sure, the graphics are somewhat better than the PlayStation's, but the gameplay is three or four steps back even from that era. Madden's funny, if repetitive commentaries have been replaced with the bizarre 'Ask Madden' feature that has no realism at all, the radio commentator is nothing short of annoying, the crowds are lethargic, and on and on.This game really has nothing to redeem it -- the game modes are few and un-entertaining also.I most likely will not buy another NFL game for the 360 should ""Madden"" be in the title, and I certainly won't buy it on name alone if I do."
1,"If I could have given it 0 stars, I would have","Every year i buy Madden without playing it. I have been playing Madden football since Madden '92; every year it is one of my favorite games, and I will be playing throughout the football season, and into the summer to tide me over unitl next fall. Then I played this trash masquerading as a John Madden Football title. I dont even want to get in to it here, but I will never purchase another madden game again unitl I play it first."
1,regular xbox 07 better,"I have the xbox and xbox 360. I also have madden 07 on both. Madden 07 on the 360 sucks. The game play is just so different that its really hard to get used to. Put it this way, I've tried to play it several times and can't get through a whole game. Madden 07 on regular xbox is 5 stars!!!! Stick with that one."
2,No good,Madden 07 is nothing like it was in the past... the biggest issue is mainly the franchise mode.1. There is longer the ability to make your own team2. The salary cap after one season is always wrong which makes it almost impossible to go on to play another season.3. Drafting and recruiting players isn't nearly as in depth as it was in the past. (Maybe because they made NFL Head Coach they decided they could exclude stuff from Madden 07)The only thing that seems to be better is Superstar mode with it being more realistic and fun to play.
2,You are better off with the other console versions,Yes the graphics are pretty -- except for player faces -- but this game doesn't even match the gameplay of Playstation 2 Maddens of a few years ago.EA pulled the sheets over my head -- don't let them do it to you too.
2,WOW SUCKY,Well I figured i'd cry a little too ... This game is terrible I went out at mid-night on its release date to get it. Bought it picked up my buddy and some mt dew for a long night of playing. Right away it froze. Then we were playing and i relized i can see exactally what plays he was picking. Which kind of takes the fun out of defense he's passing better drop back and pick it off. Well we played one game and I said screw this I'll being you home. Really haven't played all that much since. My buddy has got it for playstation 2 and we have played it way more. Buttons are easier - can't see what plays he is picking - and game play is smoother - but of course graphics really suck but I say lets work harder next year EA and ill buy it once I see a good review ... BOOOOOOOO!!!!
1,crap if you like to manage & draft,"Well - gameplay is OK, and you can make it easy enough to whip anyone at any time with any team. However, if you like the scouting & drafting aspect, this game us USELESS. You cannot scout anyone, so you have to basically rely on their ""list"" of draft picks which is crap at best too. Trading is lame and pathetic - basically to get anything its like LT for a 2nd round pick...gee, thanks. Overall its lame and a waste. However, its all we have until the EA contract runs out or they rename the games from ESPN. Also - DO NOT EVER waste your money every year on these - PLEASE..they do not change much other than rosters and maybe a bump here and there. Otherwise - EA is milking you like a cow."
1,This will NEVER come close to 2K,Read what Bigg V (Tazzmanian) said. He put it better than I ever could.It's a subpar waste of cash. 2 Stars because it plays a little bit better than 06.Madden will never touch 2K's NFL 2K5. Never.
1,What?,"Everything missing from last year has been added into this years version?!?! I don't think so. One glaring omission is the lack of multiplayer co-op. For some reason EA wants you to only take on one of your friends instead of giving you the option of 2 on 2, 3 on 1, or 4 versus the AI. Sad really considering this should be the premier version of Madden on the premier next gen system. Ironically the Gamecube and Xbox versions both have 4 player co-op. What gives EA?"
5,great game,"people that give this less than 5 stars are not a true gamer, the game is great, graphics are awesome....only downfall you need to set the penalties up or they willnot call to many flags"
2,hey look another crappy game from the crappy developer EA,"hey ea thanks for buying the license, and not allowing 2k to give us actual GOOD football games. This game sucks. nfl 2k5 was better then this. 2k is better then EA becuase 2k tries. EA puts the same game out with new rosters. I garuntee, put out 2k6, with the different rosters. noone will know the difference."
2,Just Rent,"You probably read many of the other reviews. I have to side with the negative reviews on this one. Yet another $60 360 game that is not up to par. If you have never played football on a console before, you might like this. I stopped buying EA games last year and will continue to not buy them. Renting them is the best that EA deserves at this point."
1,The King is dead!,"Once upon a time Madden was the best hands down. It would kill anybody who came to the table, but now Madden is to fat to move. No I am not talking about the host but his game or should I say the game with his name because he is not in it. This game is a joke all of the things you loved about it in the past are missing. They have added SuperStar mode but overall the game is flat. The presentation sucks, the off field features are not there, you can't edit players even there numbers! Please save your money and buy for xbox1."
2,EA made a big mistake,This game is fun if you xbox doent freze up. they did take out make a team and fanasty draft which really sucks. I do like the new superstar mode thats is really fun. The new play calling way is diffrent but you can pick in many diffrent catgorys. the bad part is the if you play with a friend they can see your play. you all so get none of the old option in fanstie mode like rebuild stadum and set ticket prices. Im trying to covince my self that it's only this bad because they had to relase one on xbox 360 really fast and diddnt put much time into it and just threw it out there. I really hope Ea inproves this for xbox and please put John Madded and Al Michels back at comtator. It does have good grapics and when it doesnt freeze it kind of fun. My advie unless your dieing for it wait till 08 comes out and mabye it will be better
1,THIS SUCKS!!,"I know MADDEN 08 is 2 months around the corner, but when i tried this 07 for XBOX 360 i was really disgusted, i think the first reviewer summed it up in detail but what really annoyed me was, the menu, the fact in the 07 you cannot set the quarter time, or i have not figured it out. The editing the players is also nonexistant, i actually enjoyed changing face masks, helmet types, builds ect...as for the game play, what is up with the new way of kicking, the graphics was a total step back, as if EA used a different engine. I would rather have the game play look good rather then the instant replays. O the audible and hot route buttons for the xbox 360 is too complicating, i tell you what i think the best Madden was the 2006 for regular XBOX, thank god i still have it, i play it all the time, at gamerosters.com i got the updated college players to bring to NFL, love reliving the 07 draft. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!"
1,worst madden ever,"this is probably old news by now, but i just realized amazon.com kept all my previous purchases on file, so i'm reviewing most of them at once now to help out fellow consumers--i always appreciate it myself so i'm returning the love. oh, the game? can i score this -1 on a scale of 1 to 10? dang...giving this a 1 is being too nice! worst madden ever. but you probably already knew that. Granted madden 08 was a huge leap forward, but i still miss the playbook feature--something any self-respecting former college QB who's worth their metal would love. Come on EA!! Its too bad the NFL chose to give an exclsuive liscense to EA, or any sport doing so with any company, since its human nature to rest on your laurels. This franchise was king, and now is a peon! Although madden 08 at least shows improvement, so maybe just a squire now..."
1,Another Year Another EA disaster,"This game is absolutely ridiculous. I have played football games since NES and this one feels like that is where it belongs. Game play is horrible and if that's the case then who cares about graphics. If you want visuals watch a movie, if you want game play you had better look elsewhere for a football game. EA needs to stick to the Sims and let true football fans and players create football games."
1,What Happed EA?,"Next Gen? No, not when the ""current generation (i.e. x-box)"" variation is better than it's superior big brother for the 360.I won't go into all the details seeing that most reviewers have already nailed the major points (see below).I just don't understand how EA ca n fall this far short. Even the little details like every player wearing Reebok cleats (which they don't) or the fact that you can't create you own player the way you were able to on the older versions. Yea, these are small details, but that is what made EA's Madden Franchise great, paying attention to details and giving the gamer what they wanted.Watch out EA, 2K games is on the verge of winning my loyalty!"
3,What can you do?,"There's no competition, you have no other options if you want a football game with updated rosters. I cannot find myself playing this one though for two huge reasons:1) No more fantasy draft in Franchise mode. I don't follow teams, I follow players and want the chance to draft certain ones for my team. Thanks for taking this option away.2) No more in-game saves. I don't always have an hour or more to play a full game, I want to be able to save when I can't finish a game.I'm reverting back to Madden 05 and sticking with that. Since there's no competition they have no need to make a better product, so I have no reason to buy anymore new editions. Thanks guys."
1,going in the wrong direction,"I really am beside myself on how bad this game or this version of the game is. I was always a madded person versus an NFL 2K whatever person but man do I miss those days. everything i like about this franchise is gone, everything I hate about football games is here. Why do I want to do a superstar mode? just create a different game or put it in NFL head coach and get it out of this game. Give me owners mode! Fanatsy Drafts! Create your own team! more statistics! more minicamp games! more playcalling cusomization. Why would I ever want to play as an offensive lineman? seriously? How is this a good idea. oh and by the way I only have 2 thumbs. if I need to hit 5 buttons to do some special move, thats not fun. this isn't super streetfighter. yeah this game sucks, and it truley pains me to say that."
1,Same game every year,ok I am getting sick and tired of these sports games. I mean they may be fun for you people but to me I think it is a waist of money. I mean come on. its the same game every year. they only add like new caricters and ups the graphics and adds a little something something to the game (like a quest mode or something). come on people they are injoying taking your money.I played an old one for the super nintendo and yup guess what its all the same. SO STOP WAISTIONG YOUR MONEY AND SPEND IT ON SOMETHING ELSE.... like your girl friend or wife. thats it I am out of here.- fomey
4,Get a life!!!,"This Madden game is nice. And honestly if the majority of people actually had a life and played video games every now and then they wouldn't feel so bad. I think it's a shame to read all the comments about what everybody hates about the game. Obviously you won't be happy unless you can plug a controller into the TV and actually control the players on Sunday afternoon. Really, go outside get some sunlight, something to eat, hell maybe even a girlfriend. Just take some time out."
1,Do Not Buy the Xbox 360....buy the PS2 Version,"If you weren't already getting frustrated that you shelled out some $600 for a system that has wielded maybe 2 or 3 good but not great games. Well heres another reason to put a PS3 on your wish list and sell your 360 while it's still worth something. The 360 version is lacking so many of the features that we've come to just expect with a Madden football game. No fantasy draft, no owner mode, no ability to edit players outfits and jerseys, stupid home game commentary w/o Madden and Al Michaels, glitches galore in the gameplay. I honestly returned my copy and went out and bought a PS2 and Madden 07 for that. Do not waste your money on good graphics when the game plays like NFL Gameday 99."
4,Great Game!,"I understand the concerns about losing some of the in depth drafting and team building that existed in previous versions...but this game is still very good! The graphics are better than anything in the past! In addition, online play rocks!I found it to be a very enjoyable game, that all levels of gamers could pick up and play, and still have fun.And if you want to go solo, pick your parents (which picks the position you play) and let it rip! I ended up being a Quarterback who was drafted in the second round by the Raiders.Too fun!"
4,Great for playing with your frieinds,This is a great game if your planning on playing with your friends. It's franchise mode is okay but no fantasy draft stinks. Overall this is just a fun game to play with your friends.
2,Madden 07 is not as good as it should be.,"After ESPN 2k sports sold out to madden a couple years ago, I was forced to play madden even though I've hated it for years. Madden 06 wasn't too bad and with buying an Xbox 360 I decided to pick up Madden 07. First off the graphics are good, the game interface is terrible and often at times very frustrating. No team create, player creation lacks fun. And trying to increase players skills is hard and a bad way of improving your player. If you play with you team past 2006 to 2020 etc. the rookies will start being numbered ""0"" or single digit numbers for any type of position, an exmaple being Linbacker number ""5."" This game is all what it's hyped up to be."
3,Madden just keeps getting worse,"EA Sports has really let their loyal following down with the last couple of Madden's. It just seems like something is missing in this game. The graphics are good, but that is one of the only good things about the game. I was mad that Madden wasn't doing the play-by-play. How can a game called Madden not even have Madden it it? Instead, there's a local radio analyst who is extremely repetitive. The only reason I gave this game three stars was because I love football. Other than that, this game isn't very good. Too bad they bought out the rights for an NFL game. Madden would be so much better if it still had competition from the much better 2K Sports."
1,Bugs,"I've been playing Madden for years & this release is absolutely killing me. Can't begin to count how many times the game has given me the ""clean your disk"" error message...new from the box to the tray...I contacted EA support, their resolution was for me to send them more money for a replacement disk. I've seen several message boards with different people complaning about the same issue, you'd think EA would step up and do the right thing...but no...continues to crash...I did hear that the Hall of Fame Edition doesn't have this problem."
2,Once again(and for the last time) Madden dissapoints,"Every year Madden dissapoints, and we are led back to the slaughter this year. But, EA Sports topped themselves this year. Because as an XBOX 360 user, we get an extra treat. We pay $20 more and GET LESS FEATURES. Missing is the fantasy draft. YOU CAN NOT DRAFT YOUR OWN TEAM. On top of that there is a fatigue glitch, which means NO ONE GETS TIRED. The manual has been reduced to four pages (I can only guess next year it will be two), and there are at least 8 new rating categories per player, yet no explanation as to what they do. This is the last year I buy Madden. I ask myself every year, why do I do it. It is quite sad that EA SPORTS gets exclusive rights and then produces such a lackluster game. Very sad indeed."
1,Worst MAdden ever,"I waited almost a year for this game since 2005 and 2006 were the worst madden games up until 2006, and I could not wait for the next generation madden football.Here are important facts:1. The gameplay is ok, but it looks the same as in previous madden games.2. YOu no longer can create your own plays, thus you are basically limited to whatever playbook is available from EA.3. They changed the control buttons that had been used for years and most of us who have played the series were used to them. The game is not challenging, memorizing or geting used to the control buttons is.The menus are confusing and there is a time when you can not change the game time duration which is frustating.Do not expect anything exciting from this game, it is at most an avererage game, but in my opinion is worth less than 10 dollars."
5,TRIBUZY! The new band that needs to be heard!!,"Highly recommended for any hard rock fan. If you loved Iron Maiden, you will love TRIBUZY! Featured artists get together in Brazil and join forces with Renato Tribuzy, an amazing vocal talent. Renato's voice has depth, range and soaring qualities you will love. Bruce Dickinson is also welcomed on stage making a stadium shaking performance singing his Tears of the Dragon and Beast in the Light, written by Renato Tribuzy. The band themselves have their own amazing talent and this band will break out of Brazil to storm the world with their progressive, heavy sound. Clean, hard and fast, you will love these guys!"
4,Polisherd...almost too polished.,I really enjoy this DVD.The band is superb and the vocals are incredible.Plus a HUGE array of special guests make this a strong release.
5,No real complaints,"It's a durable fuel tank. No real complaints. Easily worth the price; just remember you need a brass fitting to connect to the black fuel gauge assembly, (it's just a threaded hole, ready for a 1/4"" NPT brass fitting) as well as hose, primer bulb, fitting for your specific motor, etc."
3,"Ok, if you're on a budget, but the gaskets leak.","Do not leave these in a hot garage, or in the sun. That's probably true of any gas tank, but gas expansion leaks out the gasket when these things heat up. My entire garage smelled really bad like gas and I was worried it could cause a fire. I store them outside now (out of the sun). Other than that they are good quality I guess. They are much lighter than metal tanks so removing some weight will help you get your speed up in a little more if you are aiming for that. The gas leaking out the gasket is annoying though and I often get gas smell on my hands when handling them. I'm sure in the winter they wont be a problem. I think I'd probably get them again as I don't want to deal with corroding metal gas tanks and I'd like to keep as much weight as possible off.Oh, forgot to mention that the fuel gauge is pretty much worthless."
3,Don't follow instructions for installing quick connect,"Don't follow the instructions on the side of the box for installing your quick connect. Just install the quick connect onto the fuel pickup on the tank. If you follow the instructions for removing the fuel pickup, you may damage the gasket."
5,Great cheap tank,"tank is well constructed, made of heavy duty plastic. works really well. Ive had no problem with it so far and for the price you cant beat it. this tank wont let you down like the other more expensive ones with paper thin plastic."
3,Kiefer is cool!,"This 'Reservoir Dogs'-esque action-drama is definitely worth a watch. Directed by my fave actor Kiefer Sutherland, who also stars alongside Vincent Gallo (the director of the recent 'Buffalo 66') it follows the age-old formula of a heist-gone-wrong film. But it's entertaining and keeps your interest, and Kiefer's character is interesting to say the least! If you like Kiefer Sutherland, I recommend this film, and you will probably like it if you liked 'Reservoir Dogs'."
2,Dramatic Yawner,"A crowd of people that don't get along are on the lam and take a couple hostages. The cops are mad, the mob is mad, cars are stolen, and I was bored. Nothing substantially interesting is brought to the table, and the tepid classic rock tunes selected as the soundtrack make the going even more tedious.Basically a bunch of not-so-brights don't think their caper through and it all goes awry. The interminable dialogue interludes are downright boring, yet fitting what with the stupidity of the characters. Ice-Cube's non-acting ability highlights the moronic nature of the whole thing. Martin Sheen was absolutely hilarious as the mobster creepy guy. I laughed outloud many a time as he blathered about. I don't know if he was trying to satirize Brando's metaphysical mutterings from 'Apocalypse Now,' but it sure came across that way."
1,nothing to brag about...,this movie has been made lots of times before. it is nothing great.what made me stop watching this sick movie. there is a torure scene in it that really wasnt nessary. and made me sick. the ending when i got around to watching it was good but sad. could've not really reminded us on how messed up the world is.
4,Not too bad,"Okay, lets take this movie step by step. First of all, yes it may a tired old storyline. But lets keep in mind that there are people who like this sort of thing. So, for those people I would say this movie was not all that bad. Acting was pretty good, and the script certainly wasn't the worst that has ever been. And the directing, well, not so bad. Since Kiefer Sutherland has been in tons of movies, you would think that he would know the ropes by now. And I believe that he does. He just may need to come into his own style of doing things. All around good movie, I even cried a little at end."
3,"The Poor Man's ""One False Move""","This is an action-packed robbers on the run film in the model of Carl Franklin's One False Move, but while Franklin's film had a tightly-woven plot, here there were two many subplots and predictable scenes. Keifer Sutherland is...well, Keifer Sutherland. He never plays against type, as the hardcore villain, and this role is no exception. Still, there are more twists than a licorice whip, and the film takes us through a grisly robbery and chase that thankfully omits the cliches of similar films. Outstanding performance from Myketi Williams.Recommended for fans of such fare."
2,Another Tarantino wanna be!,"Truth and Consequences, N.M is a non original story about four criminals that are running from the police , and one of them is a cop (Reservoir Dogs did better) who is setting them up. A movie you should watch when you are so bored you resort to watching Jerry Springer. I should of known a mess would take place when actors start thinking they are directors. - Michael Margetis"
1,Outdated,"This book is outdated, so not very helpful. Moreover, the suggestions are pretty obvious - I was hoping for a book that gave more specific ideas on what to buy and where (in other words, as an apartment-dwelling mom, what products make sense given the space constraints and where can these be bought today in 2007), where to go (for example, child-friendly gyms), etc. Although there were some suggestions, the suggestions were very outdated."
2,Get what you pay for,Fits well. Does not protect the top corners. Belt clip is not detachable. Once its on its not easy to get off. I ripped mine trying to get it off.It does look pretty good though.
4,I leave out one star because there is a lot more they left out.,"There are 5 interviews on this DVD. So this means there are two full seasons left out. I have them all on VHS. All brilliantly hilarious and a shame vaulted away when it can bring soo much joy to thousands. The best ones are left out for some reason. Martin Short is the only comedian clown master that can always truly bring me to tears from laughter. Please release it with all seasons. And if you have Netflix look out for Glick Don't Do Red Carpet. Made only for Netflix where he, Glick, gets one of the last interviews with the late Great Dennis Hopper. Martin Short is a genius."
2,It had some funny parts,There were moments of sheer comic genius that had me rolling. Mostly it was waiting for something interesting to happen.
1,2006 Acura TSX,"It is the exact size but half the wiper suspends in the air, and very filmsy attachment. Went to the dealer and got a refill for the original wiper."
1,wont stay attached,"the plastic connector that attaches this wiper blade to the wiper arm is too weak. when i turn on the wipers, these blades flip on their side. waste of money"
5,Worth it!,This short film takes the indie genre to a new level. The first review says it all. This one is worth adding to your DVD library.
3,Definitely not for the novice,"I'm sure this is a great book for technophiles, but as someone who has begrudgingly come into the computer age, I found this book to be both overwhelming and hard to follow. It has lots of tips, but I found it impossible to sift through. I passed the book on to one of my more techno friends."
3,Pretty cool.,"Well, it's a pretty cool book ... but, I have to admit I haven't used one trick so far. Not sure why, but a lot of them seem unrealistic to me. I'm sure someone can use them, but most are not for me."
1,All those tricks can easilly found in internet,"Well, that's it, i've purchased a book that is giving me tricks that or i allready know or can be very use to find if needed. So, it is not worth at all..."
4,Computer Hack - Not Life Hack,"This book is definitely worth the time to pickup and read. As someone who has a million shortcuts in my life, I was hesitant picking this book up. But the first 25-40 hacks are gold. Solid Gold.Most of the information in this book can be found in various locations. But the author brought everything together in one place.My only criticsm of the book, was that it was written for the layman, for the most part. Descriptions on how to use flicker etc, were uncalled for. We'll figure it out. And many hacks were completed half way...and never really completed with any flourish. I'd like to see a part II, which takes those same hacks, and takes them to the next level. Ie - Email yourself a backup hack taken to times 10 wiht backup, and information inside the email."
1,Does not fit I Pod Touch 5th Generation,I will be returning this. It didn't specify that it is not fit for the new I Pod touch 5th generation.
3,Missing wire,i mean it would work maybe if i had the wire for it other than that good product the description should say with out wire.........
3,Oops!,"I made the mistake of not reading the item specs and thought it was a charger... it is actually a firewire adaptor and I am not familiar with that and was disappointed because I thought I was ordering a charger. Luckily amazon is such a fabulous company and I was able to return the item even though it was my mistake. The item appeared to be a quality item, the shipping was fast, and it was packed well."
5,"Sure, why not","While this Apple power adapter way not be anything fancy or elegant by Apple's standards, it is very useful. Aside from its job of powering up your laptop, it has built-in extending arms to wrap your power cord around. This helpful feature reduces clutter."
1,No Way!,who would even think about buying something that plugs into the wall for sixty bucks! maybe thats why the ipod is so expensive................
2,Do Not Buy For Ipod 4Th Gen!!! will not work!!,i got this at a decent price expecting it to work on my ipod touch 4g but when i plugged it init said it is not a supported charger and flat out wouldn't charge does anyone know how to fix this?aside from that if things weren't going so well in my life right now id be pretty angry but eh whatever lol
4,A mellifluous voice,"A mellifluous voice,powerful,sensitive and sensual. Original in a sense that it tackles issues that have been hidden, a taboo, in the macho latino culture.No sentimentalisms about abuelitas but raw reality--erotic poignant violent. Anxious to read more from this new star in western literature.Thomas M Kazamias"
5,women in history,"Oprah really needs to read this book! I would also reccomend this book to any that are teaching peotry or women, I have found this book to be fun and educational."
1,W-A-C-K,This CD is wack. I bought this thinking it would be like Laid In Full the first one. Don't waste your cashe on this wack mix CD. I don't know any of my friends who think this DJ is good. Pick up X-cutioners or Peanut Butter Wolf if you want to listen to good DJs.
1,...,If you tell me this is underground you are wrong. The beats sound unoriginal and this MBogie cat has no new moves to give us. This is typical of these record bizness guys who can't make it on there own and overcharge us hip hop fans for weak... complations. Only 2 good songs here...
2,Could be better...,"If M-Boogie had brought back some of the talent from the first Laid In Full. All this CD represents is a reason to push M-Boogie artists down hip hop fans throats. Akbar and Rasco are the best here. The problem with it is the beats. His beats are good, but they get repetitive. I don't consider this CD underground."
2,Yawn...This guy is just another Premiere imitator.,I know things about M-Boogie. He makes okay battle breaks albums and the first Laid In Full was definitely the freaking b to the o to the m to the b. This chapter focuses less on the best of the underground and more on M-Boogie's stable of artists and collaberaters. Mykil Myers is dope but I can live without M-Boogie's wack attempts to imetate DJ Premier. As for who M-Boogie is I will tell you what i know. This is a guy who makes house dance records on the side and if I am not wrong is the guy who runs the label Matt Terio. I live the undergroudn. This guy just wants to be it.For further information on a wannabes career see a group called Shakespear and the Lumberjack (M-boogie was the Lumberjack). No recomendations here.I do recamend Akbar since he at least is dope too.
2,galco skyops holster,the retainer is not adequate to loose does not stay in place not the quality product i expected from galco
2,"Better than part 1 & 2, but not enough.","I bought the movie because of the enticing story synopsis but was left flat due to the cheap look of the movie. Wasn't horrible, but wasn't professional looking either. Not a waste of time though, I would recommend checking it out, just don't expect a mainstream film."
1,A Poor Prep Book,"This didn't help me prepare for the national exam at all. If I would have relied on this book for the weight of my studying, I would have surely failed. The sample tests were too simple, and the chapters were VERY brief. I do not recommend this book."
2,Not very good.,"The two final tests do not represent the National Registry in anyway. First of all, they are 100 questions and second of all the tests are pathetically easy. The registry is a lot harder and a lot more conceptual. The book doesn't review much, it just gives you bullets of the stuff you need to know and then you have to actually go find the details of those bullets.I don't recommend."
3,50/50,"The Enterprise Incident is one of my favorite episodes, but And The Children Shall Lead is incredibly bad. Actually, might be worth a viewing for a laugh."
3,Good and Not.,"I bought this DVD purley for the fact that ""The Enterprise Incident"" Is one of the best of the original episodes made. The other episode ""And the Children Shall Lead"" is so embarassing that it is not even funny. It contains the cheap effects combined with the ridiculous and ill-concieved storyline. I mean, really. A bunch of children that have the power to take over the people of the Enterprise and are led by evil? I mean please. The Enterprise incident is a good epsiode to watch, and the children shall lead is good for a laugh at its stupidity and a joke."
5,Truly the best! (And one of the worst!),"The Enterprise Incident isn't ""one"" of my favorites, it IS MY favorite of the original 79. Joanne Linvilles' performance is stunning. She shows us in so many ways glimpses of the Romulan culture we hadn't seen, and in many ways, things we will never see again. The ""score"" here is captivating and judging by some of the looks Spock gives, it sometimes makes you wonder what his thoughts truly were. This is simply the most rounded episode and most informative... now as for ""And The Children Shall Lead..."" the review of this dvd is scored only on The Enterprise Incident, I can't see holding ""And..."" against that superbly crafted episode. ""And..."" is just a poorly conceived romp...."
3,One of the best and the worst on one DVD.,"The ""Enterprise Incident"" has to be one of my favorite episodes because it involves the very rarely seen Romulans. However, ""And the Children Shall Lead"" is absolutely horrible. I might even go as far to say that it is the worst episode of the whole series.This DVD is worth buying for hard core Star Trek fans. No collection is complete without the ""Enterprise Incident!"""
2,The only thing good about this book is nothing.,"I certainly hope Frey takes his time and produces a decent product next time. The Day Trader is junk. If the plot had less imagination and the characters less development, it would be a children's book.The text is at a 3rd grade level. The financial component to previous books has been intriguing. This attempt is on the level of balancing your checkbook.The only thing good about this book is nothing.Sorry Frey, you lost a reader."
1,Blahh!!!,"What a disappointment! The characters were sooo shallow and it just seemed that the words were put on the paper to fill up space. After previous great books, this was a real disappointment."
2,Slow and a lot of Problems,"This book was much Slower than Frey's other books. My major problem with this book was that it was Frey's only book that was in the First Person. The writing just didn't seem right, his third person books are all much better. BTW Frey needs to do a little bit better of a job doing research, When they go to the Baseball game the team plays the ""California Angels"" the team hasn't been California for some time now, second the home team is always in the third base side, not the first base side. It is stuff like that that makes this book off."
3,Good,"I thought this was a good book, unlike some of the other people who reviewed it. It kept me turning the pages, wondering what would happen next. Unlike other reviews, this IS worth the paper it is printed on."
2,Personal Review,"Day Trading was certainly one the most dynamic infatuations of possibly America's greatest decade. So when Frey chose to call his latest, The Day Trader, I was hoping he might capture the deeper meanings of such an interesting phenomenon. Unfortunately, I think Frey squandered a terrific opportunity. Instead of characterizing this naturally dramatic period fairly, he opted for plot devices and broad character portrayals. After it's over, you don't feel any clarity or much of anything, it's a few hundred pages of typical mystery that any subject normally provides. When fiction works well, it provides insight, gusto, and obvious enjoyment. I just didn't get it here."
1,Day Trader?? Made only a two trades throughout the 347 pgs,"I was a day trader in the 90s, and loved it. I thought there was going to be excitement about trading stocks in this book, and getting highs off making huge money, and suffering loses as well. The author does not touch stock trading really at all. Its more of a mystery/murder story, and not a good one at that. If you are looking for day trading fiction excitemnet, please look elsewhere."
2,The Day Trader,"This was definitely the poorest of Frey's books. I was really looking forward to reading it, but was disappointed. I hope his future books have more deapth to them. The characters are really shallow and you really don't care what happens to them. Agustus, the main character, is such a weakling that you begin to feel he deserves what he gets."
1,Trade it for a better one,"The editor's review was too kind. This book features a dumber-than-rocks protagonist, an inane plot, and inept character development. Don't waste your time."
2,Don't waste your time,"I have enjoyed earlier books by Stephen Frey, but this reads like something he wrote on his lunch hour because the publisher was waiting for a book. The protagonist is incredibly simple and naive, as is the narrative and the plot.A real disappointment."
3,Not as Good as other!,This book isn't as good as the other books from Frey. A good read but not great. I was beginning to put him in the class of Patterson -- but not yet. I hope the next book is better!
3,"Entertaining, Yet Disappointing","I was entertained reading The Day Trader, but I was disappointed because so little of the plot was spent on actual day trading - although I did not really realize the dearth of day trading until I had finished the book.The plot is not complex, but unlike some other reviewers, I was not offended by Stephen Frey's writing style. The lack of detail regarding a particular trade (there are only a couple transactions) intrigued me as I expected the secret to that success to be revealed later.I would like to read a fast paced novel about a day trader that detailed days of success and days of losses and frustration. The Day Trader is not that novel. However, it is entertaining and worth reading for that purpose and as an average read rates three stars."
4,An easy read,I found this novel to be easy to read. It is my first try for a Stephen Frey book and I would certainly read another one.
2,needs more drafts,"I thought this story needed to go through more drafts. The ""conflicts"" keeping the characters apart were unconvincing -- I kept thinking, ""no one would act that way"". This made it hard to sympathize with their plight. Similarly, the roadblocks in our hero's way -- such as being considered a suspect -- rested on completely irrational behavior by all (not that that's unbelievable for government agents, but still). The ultimate resolution of the ""mystery"" was a letdown. The info about the Big Hurrican itself was interesting."
2,Very light reading...,"The subject matter could have been really fascinating, but this author writes in a very light, superficial way, so the book has really been disappointing. I prefer books that really cause you to think and become involved. This book did neither.I don't think I'll be reading anything else Mr. Donlay writes."
3,too many roy rogers movies for my liking!,"Seems as if, because Roy made more movies than anyone else, Mill Creek figures we better see 'em all........ha!"
2,This Pack is Not As Advertised on Tim McCoy,"I was searching for old Western DVD's that had Tim McCoy and Ken Maynard in it. This DVD pack was highlighted as having a majority of Tim McCoy and Ken Maynard movies in it. Yet when I receive the pack the majority of the movies, (4 to 1) were Roy Rogers followed by Gene Awtrey. There was only (1) Tim McCoy movie in the pack."
2,westerns,old old stuff most of which you will find that you already have on some other set. Some entering flicks are included but not as many as you would expect in a set of fifty. I find it irritating that the producers rename the same old tired films in these sets. It seems that every time I buy one of these 50 movie sets 40 of them were sold in another set that I already have. No matter what they called it and to made it worse they even rename some of the movies.I doubt if there are very many of you out their who even know who Buster Crabbe or Gene Autry were. I am sure some of you know who Roy Rogers and Dale Evans were. Gabby Hayes and a few more appear in these movies.Enjoy them!!!
5,Frontier Justic 50 movie pack,A couple did not play correctly all the rest where ok and it bought back many memories of its cowboy stars
1,Dont Buy This Junk............!!!!!!,"Do not buy this junk, Problem is you have to clean your Printer head all the time . Print quality suck!!!!!!!!"
1,Shipping is very bad,"They won't ship to Japan, they won't ship to APO. Fine. So I selected the U.S. shipping address of my parents figuring I could have them forward the shipment. But when I got to the checkout my $15 order of six cartridges had an additional charge of $25 for shipping. Ridiculous!!!"
5,Sounds of Splendid,"This is really a tribute to faith and of the journey ""home"".The only thing to say about it ....buy it!You will be amazed."
3,"a great idea, but misses","Jewett's chapters examine a Christian context of 11 movies of the '80s, offering a fresh look at both the movies and New Testament theology. Clint Eastwood is the basis for a chaper on vengence while racial reconcilation is equated with the Jews and Gentiles in ""Grand Canyon."" The selection of movies is great in Jewett's book (Star Wars, Amadeus, Ordinary People, and Dead Poet's Society) but the relativism to the scriptures he choses is often weak and farfetched. This is a book to start one thinking about movies already seen, a starting point for discussion as the credits roll, but not great book for independent examination. A fine effort, but at times it just misses."
2,Disappointed.,"For a group that I listened to a lot as a youth, this does not reflect their true appeal. I should have paid more attention to my choice, but then again it was the Lettermen - how could I know?"
5,The Canabile,This book is one of the best detective books I have read. Cannon is very graphic in discribing everything that is going on. He also does an amazing job of keeping us in suspence.
4,good blusey rock with a new sound all its own,"JD Duvall seemed to come out of nowhere. Two new albums and no one seems to know who he is. HIs music is pure soul. interesting lyrics -- interesting subject matter, makes you think. And killer guitar playing. out of this world stuff you just dont hear too much these days. think old blues meets led zeppelin meets jeff buckley and you get a small idea of the sound he creates. somehow he manages to pull off a brasilian song in the mix -- this cats from jersey? crazy. highly recomended buy this one is."
4,Thank you for speaking out,"Thank you for speaking out. As a Divorced Dad, I have lived through the abuse and destruction of my life brought on by my unhappy ex-wife. And, of course it is the children who also have the most to lose. But the Mom cant admit her harm to her children, so she has been the neurotic, self-destructive agent, used by the child-support and family services beaurocracy to institutionize the demonization of men, in the pursuit of some sort of public family control policy. Well, enough said. Hey, I coulda got drafted and sent to war to die in a foreigh rice paddy ! So any country that can justify that, should have no trouble justifying the wholesale destruction of any marriage with a woman neurotic enough to let them."
4,bias editorial reviews above are crap,"I would like to point out the two top editorial reviews are from liberal publications and clearly bias with negative in tone and basically full of crap. There should be a little balance there...what gives Amazon?Ive seen this before with other conservative books. Always the same snotty Lefty ""professional"" book reviewers like Kirkus"
2,A Bowl of Warm Air,"As always, Moniza alvi is very keen in expressing her sense of otherness and unbelonging in most of her poems. The poems are nice and can easily be understood but when they are too many of them 'talking' about the same issue, you'll get tired of them."
4,Good book for adults to read as well as teens,"This was a great story and one adults should read also. Comparing it with adult books I normally read, I would give it 4 1/2 stars."
5,Amazing book.,This book is so suspenseful that I read till midnight. Awesome book must read. You have got to read it note Victor dies.
1,Quite the disappointment,"I started this book with a good feeling, thinking I might have found and interesting story. But really, it was quite the disappointment. The first chapter is delightful. But if you continue reading you will be upset. Not just by the none too descriptive writing but the action that leaves you confused and unknowing. I have a term I use for books like this. Reading in the dark. The plot drops in the middle, like the previous story never existed. It is not the kind of twists and turns that should be expected from a book, and this book doesn't have this either. Crossing the wire is an altogether dissatisfying book, one I beg you not to waste your time on. The story doesn't have the flair that makes you not be able to put it down, but it does have the drag that makes you put it on the shelf and walk away. I finished reading this with difficulty. Please do not make the mistake I made. If you wish to read this book, brace yourself for quite the disappointment."
4,Great Book,"This book was surprisingly very great! It was a page turning action novel that I couldn't wait to see what was next, great book!"
1,read only,"I did not try the music or video options, since I only save data, to be precise, the chapters of the books I am writing. I am trying to find a program to let me save on cd -rw disks instead of the smaller floppies. However, if you save it on the disk with this you cannot add more chapters, or anthing else, because it only allows files to be saved once, and once only. If you use only, say, 5mb on a 700 mb disk, you are informed that there is no more room on the disk. It will only save things as read-only, so you can never add on or edit."
4,Great book for beginning speech-language pathologists (SLP),"I found this book to be extremely helpful as a school-based SLP. It leads you through the process of detemining what type of narrative to elicit for each age group (preschool - 12th). The book was fairly easy to read, and came with lots of research with which to compare a child's performance. It offers many types of forms to use in the assessment process and practical exercises to practice analyzing narrative samples. I will use many of the procedures and forms in my own practice. This would be a great book for grad students as well!"
2,Whip it... Not so great!,I have had this product for a little over a year and the gasket failed. It will no longer take the charge. I am very disappointed and see that others have had this problem. Would like to know if there is a replacement part to correct this defect.
3,check it when it arrives,"I ordered two of this whippers, one white and the other silver, well, only one of them arrived with the gasket (the white one) so I can use only of these at a time because the whole cream whipper is useless without the gasket which makes me feel like I wasted half of my money. I also ordered a spare one, and it never arrived."
1,Look elsewhere,Gasket was destroyed after one day. Look at ISI Professional brand - I've had much better luck with those.
1,Far less than I expected,"I actually bought two of these. The first one jammed immediately after the first use and the product contains dire warnings about what could happen if you try to pry it open with a full load of NO^2 inside. So I bought another one because we had lost the instructions which had the return / RMA information on them.The second one loaded fine but did not discharge whipped cream with any head to it. It was watery and sprayed all over myself and the table. Yes we did load it with the recommended whipping cream and powdered sugar mix.Oh yes, the coup-de-gras was when I contacted the Amazon zStore vendor who sold it and said ""The description on Amazon says its PROFESSIONAL but nowhere on the box does it say PROFESSIONAL"". I received a very haughty answer to the effect that real PROFESSIONAL equipment doesn't say PROFESSIONAL. Bollocks to you I say."
1,cream explosion,blew liquid cream in a 4 foot diameter. trashed it after i cleaned up the kitchen. a very dissapointing experience
5,A classic,This is simply a classic movie. The end of the movie is chilling and brilliant. Not for the mainstream moviegoer but those that like something different.
4,"Superflous nudity, but a great film","This film was exceptionally good as both a horror film (which it is, but in a cerebral way) and as a good mystery (which it also is). There's some nudity in the film which doesn't contribute to the story but seems to just be there to provide lewd entertainment value. Aside from that, it's a magnificent film and well worth the cost of the DVD."
2,VERY DATED AND PREDICTABLE!,"I never saw this film growing up and I can say I was very disappointed after viewing this slow moving and predictable horror tale. Aside from some gratuitous nudity and trippy camera shots, this film is quite strange and has an ending you can see coming from miles away! I know this film has a big cult following, but I just can't see why anyone would love this film!? Many of my Amazon friends like it and to each their own, but if you are not familiar with this film, keep your expectations in check. It may have had a bigger impact back in the day, but it seems dated now."
3,not as good as the remake,Thestory is pausable. But this is not as good as the one with Nicholas cage.This was vinegar compared to wine.
2,Horrible,I brought this movie because I was told that it was a great Horror Movie. Well it was totally a lie. The movie was horrible. The only good thing that I can say about this movie is the ending. It kinda save the entire rating from being a 1 star.
1,"Weird, Dated, Lame Movie","I should have done some research before paying $2.99 to watch this movie. If musicals and the idea of animals being burned alive bother you, then skip it. I don't even know if it was a good movie. The characters were so annoying, the basic premise so overblown and browbeaten that within a few minutes I could find nothing in any scene to rest my eyes on. Maybe that was the point. It was like a long, bad acid trip. When I read later that animals actually were burned alive I just felt sick. Neither entertaining nor enlightening. Just effed-up."
2,One of Lee's Worst movies,"It all starts as a girl is missing and its up to Woodward to save the day as he tries to defeat a bunch of crazed hippie pagans...or does he?, well, lets just say the hero doesn't come out smelling like roses..i'll leave it at that. I cannot really say that this is one of Lee's best movies nor can i say its a ""classic horror movie""..thats giving it too much credit, however, i can say the movie is strange none the less.Anyways, the movie is well..boring and its portrait on pagans is lets say ""ignorance is bliss"", the story tries to stay focus, but, loses in the end. I would rent this movie before buying it to be honest and then you can either buy or not buy, but, at least rent it first. The worst thing about the movie is the ending...a word of warning though, if you don't like seeing cute little animals getting killed in a very cruel way then STAY AWAY from this movie..trust me!..you'll do yourself a favor."
2,"Interesting, but Inaccurate","As a pagan, I found this film interesting. It was maybe 40% accurate about actual pagan beliefs. The rest was just, well, bushwa. Not all that suspenseful, although Edward Woodward as the Christ obsessed cop was an intriguing character. Toward the end, I kept thinking they should have made his character a priest. Probably not one I will watch again."
5,Funny As Hell (Better The Second Time Around),"You must watch this movie more than once to fully appreciate it. I swear. The first time I didn't fully ""get it."" The second time around, I felt so thankful to watch the full movie because I knew what was going to happen and the ""set up"" by the pagans was already known ~ I understood the film much better. The best way to stop a religious fanatic is to burn him at the stake. Seriously. This should not be in ""horror"" but in ""comedy"" because (after watching it the first time) knowing what is going to happen . . . I cannot stop laughing watching it after that."
5,Whiny bitchy reviewers go home! Wickerman LE is it....,"Don't be *warned* or thwarted by these 103 minute spoiled sports.I am a HUGE fan of this film and have it on audio cassette, audioCD, VHS (the Magnum full version), and now I have the DVD LE set.I got chills when I viewed the Theatrical 84 minute version!It contained little bits that I've never seen! Too cool!The Extended version is utterly the same as the Magnum VHSversion release. I notice very little difference.What really excited me was the incredible interview footage.I learned a lot about this film that I never knew.If anybody is telling you to NOT buy this because it lacksfootage, then the truth (right from the directors mouth) isthat the footage they are looking for does NOT exist.Otherwise, I think it'd have been released within, oh, the pastthirty years at some point.I also love the neat little box it came in.""True"" fans will appreciate the gorgeous quality. End of story.byebye and best wishes!"
5,"sexy, scary, sexy, scary...",About a year ago I bought this video and every so often I put it on...Last night I visited Wicker Man again and noticed the film gets better every time. I wish there was a soundtrack for this...also of note...I would say this movie has one of the hottest scenes...shown tastefully...watch for the pounding on the wall during the second night in the inn.
2,Ludicrous,I rented this because I love Edward Woodward but the movie was weird! I read that it was such a wonderful movie but I found it to be ridiculous!
5,Very good movie,"You need to see the Wickerman to appreciate its unusual story. The basics of the story is a British police officer goes to a remote island to check on a girl reported missing. A set of bizarre incidents turns things around and when he thinks he is making prograess he finds himself in a very desparate situation. To say anything more would spoil the story. Edward Woodward does a great job as the policeman. I cannot attempt to describe the story as it would only make the whole thing sound silly, so you will just have to buy or rent it to find out."
4,original wickerman,"It's been quite a while since I've seen this one. It was considered rather shocking at the time it was made and is rather dated. Still, it's worth a watch and by far, better than the remake. Christopher Lee is a pleasure to watch, as always. Edward Woodward as the constable is wonderful, singing hymns right up to the end."
1,The Wicker Man 1973,I cannot believe Rotten Tomatoes gave this an 89% by the critics. The only interesting thing about the movie was to show the tacky dress and hairstyles that we had in the early 1970's - I should know since I was in my early 20's at that time. Horror??? Boring is more like it.
2,Very dated and extremely slow.,"I had read great reviews of this film so my wife and I both just watched it and were extremely dissapointed. The film is extremely slow, which sometimes can be great if it builds tension, however in this case it was just boring. Snail pace to a very predictable ending. This is not a horror film at all, so if you want to be scared go elsewhere."
2,I have to agree with the previous reviewer,"I have heard so much about this movie, I had to see it. Instead of being intrigued by what was going on, I was laughing at the acting and stupidity of the subject matter. Being pagan myself and maybe being offended by the protrail of the subject matter I thought the movie was just plain bad, so bad it was funny and humorus. ""spoiler"" I did get really sick of the investigating police officer whining all of the time about being Christian, it just grew very tiresome. It wasn't about him being Christian it was about him being a sacrafice."
1,BEWARE,"This movie is horrible. Don't be fooled by the few people who say us ""wicker Man haters"" are narrow minded. I admit that it was very unconventional. I love things that don't go by the book. However, you could make a movie unconventional by ending it halfway through the story and it still wouldn't make it good."
1,Just an unpleasant film!,"I rented this one at the video store, and when it was over I wished I hadn't. Basically, it's just an island where the druids still reign, unbeknownst to the rest of England. They still practice human sacrifice. It started out promising, but in the end I wondered why they even bothered. A waste of my time."
2,THE WICKER MAN,Good photography and camera work! Writing was poor and I found the movie to be a great waste of good acting talent from good actors! Although the movie was meant to be a horror flick I personally don't like it when evil rules and the devil wins in the end. Other than that the constant negativity was occasionally well glossed over with some fine nudity. I will be giving my copy away. I probably should burn it!
4,A total cult!,"Firstly, I knocked off a star for the annoying way we change from old to newer film throughout the movie. I realise this was the best they could do with the magnetic tape that was available but it does annoy me.Edward 'Enforcer' Woodward inspects shady goings on in Christopher Lee's unhinged community off the West coast of Scotland and ends up helping a chicken with its enquiries. Britt Ekland (and boobs), Ingrid Pitt, sketch show musician Peter Brewis and John 'Mallens' Hallam appear."
4,Wicker Man 88 Minutes,"Editing on this version is too much, ruining the movie. Get the full / long version [ + 11 minutes ]..."
5,one of the most powerful and misunderstood movies so far,"The movie does a good job highlighting the different philosophies behind the ""Old ways"" (paganism) and Christianity. The movie also turns the mirror on Christianity a faith that has burned more than one 'witch'. ""Wicker Man"" can be disturbing to those who may not understand Paganism and fundamentalists. The full length version is the way to go. If you can find it. This movie needs to be made more available to the public!!!!!!!!"
3,"OK, but ultimately disappointing","This is a typical late 60s/early 70s ""horror"" film pitting Christianity against paganism. It has some beautiful cinematography, some ok acting, and some of the most ludicrous music in a horror film save for Last House on The Left. In fact, some of the music could easily have fit right into Finian's Rainbow. The ending is affective but predictable, showing the only true horror being man's ability for brutality. The characters are one-dimensional at best, and neither sinister or sympathetic in any way."
2,Neither Christians or Pagans Come Off Very Well,Much has been made of the portrayal of Christians in this movie due to the character of the police officer. He's got the stereotype down pat as he has repressed and prudish attitudes towards sex and he is angrily intolerant of any religious beliefs and practices that are not his own.Yet little has been made of the portrayal of pagans in this movie which is equally negative given the film's conclusion. Just imagine if bigots like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson ever got a hold of this movie. The ending would confirm a major fallacy they and those of their ilk would like to perpetuate against modern day pagans.
1,Great film - but not this version,"The Wicker Man is a great film - a one-off unlike anything else. Christopher Lee thinks it might be his best performance, and I'd agree. However, this film has suffered release in butchered versions and unfortunately this DVD is one of them. The original verion of this film is 104 minutes long. The DVD version is an 88 minutes. Imagine another of your favorite movies with 16 minutes cut out of the climax. Someday The Wicker Man will be released as it was intended and I'll be able to give it 5 stars. Until then, hunt for the out-of-print uncut video version. It's out there and it's worth it."
3,Not like I remember it...,"It's a great movie, beloved among many of us modern non-jesus-worshipping types. So unless you're buying it blind, you probably know what you're getting. Beware though, this edition left a little out. An expository scene at the start of the movie, one which explains that the Inspector is a 30-something virgin (*eeew*) seems to be missing, which caused a bit of confusion among folks that had never seen it. You may want to spring for the deluxe edition, which may contain said scene."
3,87 minutes - BAD!! 101 minutes - GOOD!!!,"The above rating is an average: 5 stars for the 101-minute cut. The 87-minute version (depicted above) gets only one star. How important can 14 minutes be? Stop watching ""Casablanca"" or ""The Usual Suspects"" 14 minutes from the end and you'll know. The original was wonderful. This is just sad."
4,2-Disk has both versions,"Fear not Wicker Fans! According to the Anchor Bay website, the 2-disk SE will contain both the American 88-minute version, with the 'extended' 99-minute version on disk two, along with a commentary and other goodies.I LOVE this film and am looking forward to dumping my old VHS copy in favor of this shiny new version.As others have said, it's a wonderful film. It's quite refreshing for once to see pagans NOT portrayed as a bunch of devil worshipers wearing black robes, casting evil spells and chanting around a fire (even though that does go on)."
2,Weird,"Amusing, weird a good watch if you cant' sleep at night. I would say it should be in the comedy section not thriller!"
3,The Wicker Man,"The Wicker ManIf you are a fan of this film you MUST get the director's cut that adds back scenes that explain more of the Edward Woodward's character. The theatre release does not convey the creepiness of the story that the initial scenes provide. Also, there is a lovely musical number cut from the theatre release.The comments by the actors on the 2 DVD set are wonderful if you want to get a sense of the impact this cult classic has in Scotland and around the world. It's very Seventies, with background on the lesser known character actors, poetry and music incorporated into the film."
4,It is time to keep your appointment....,"This movie is quite possibly one of the best and most underrated movies. Don't even watch the Wicker Man remake, it hardly even comes close to the caliber of the original. Christopher Lee is amazing as Lord Summerisle, and his charm and wit are quite disarming to an unsuspecting Sgt. Howie. The entire cast does a phenomenal job and the special edition comes with the American release (don't bother, watch the extended edition) and the unedited British version (watch this one instead, it explains alot more and is far more engrossing) The only real problem is that on the extended one there are scenes which aren't the same quality as the rest of the movie (you can tell which is the older footage not originally in the film vs the better looking parts) It would have been nicer if they'd completely remastered both movies including the added footage in the extended movie. That's the only reason it's getting 4 stars. Well worth the money, I highly recommend this movie!"
4,Great Movie. Dvd looks a bit washed out though,"This is a great movie. The kind of horror that doesn't need special effects and monsters. Just freaky people and freaky environment.The dvd is the latest and best dvd version of this movie, too bad it looks washed out, but I guess its the best they could do.Don't judge this movie based on the disgustingly bad remake of Nicholas Cage."
1,Bad bad movie,"OK this is going to be a very short review this movie stinks. I felt like I was ripped off. I was not scared and just don't see how so many people liked this film. I like all types of films and art but this movie is horrible, terrible, and boring.But this is not the worst movie I have seen that distinction belongs to the classic 'Dawn of the Dead'. So I guess if you like 'Dawn of the Dead' then you might like this one.I was very disappointed with this film."
1,Great Reviews!....Why?,"Oh man...this movie was bad. I heard a lot of good things about it. I heard it was scary, intelligent, and most of all entraining. So, I decided to fork out money for the special edition.After finishing the movie I felt like all hope in humanity was lost....Okay, it's not that bad. However, I don't see how it could get so many great reviews! I mean I like a lot of movies from Magnolia to Hedwig and The Angry Inch. I figured this would be one of those movies that blow me away and I would go to each one of my family members and friends and tell them all about it.Oh how I was wrong. The movie has a horrible story...if you do like this movie it's for the sex and sex only. It's boring, too long, and boring again! Don't buy this movie. Please, if you want to keep your soul intact DO NOT BUY NOR RENT THIS MOVIE!"
3,WICKER MAN,I HAVE NOT ACTUALLY WATCHED IT YET BUT REMEMBER WHEN IT ORIGINALLY CAME OUT AND IT WAS A VERY GOOD FILM INDEED
1,One of the five worst films of all time,"Worse than Last Tango in Paris. The epitome of overrating. Silly, 60's-type self-indulgent, introspective idiocy."
1,Waste your money and watch only once!,"You might fall into the trap of thinking this is a great, must-have film by following various links and suggestions, etc., and that it belongs in your collection right with Alfred Hitchcock, Dario Argento, etc. Hah!The other reviewers are right: it's not horror, it's not terror, it's really not even art. This film is a bunch of nonsense with a ""hot"" ending.IF YOU MUST HAVE IT, I'd buy the single disc because the double version only contains a few extra minutes embedded into the same film.This is a movie you will surely only watch ONCE. I don't crave extras, but I do prefer to buy movies that will have a lasting entertainment value; films that I will want to watch again and again."
2,"Um, Ok.....","This is certainly the worst ""horror"" film I've seen. I guess while others see this as being artistic or filled with taboo subject matter, I just see it as a laughably bad movie.The nude dancing sequence made me crack up.The music was so bad it was funny (although it was the 70's)Not much of a plot going on.The police officer's strong religious convictions come off as whiny and tiresome, and I was pretty glad to see his fate at the end.Christopher Lee is the only good point I can think of.All in all, I suppose it was an ""educational experience"" for me to see this widely celebrated 70's ""classic"". I guess maybe I expect every old horror film to be as good as the Vincent Price classics, so I learned my lesson. I don't see how this movie is good enough to warrant a remake.If you want to be scared this is not the movie for you. This movie is great for a laugh, though."
4,"Informative, but needs some...","ZING PoW Pizazz! This is an interesting instructional video on how to assemble wicker furniture. But its boring. I need some stimulation, if you know what I mean. ;)This is really good to pull out and hit it in rear."
1,Yikes!,"First let me say that my seller was AWSOME. The price was great and the shipping was quick! My seller is not responsible for how AWFUL this movie actually is. I have read so many things on the internet stating that this movie is a cult classic and how great it is and scary and awsome. This movie was actually WORSE than the remake...how can ANYTHING be worse than an over acted Nicholas Cage movie??? I didn't think it was possible, but this movie made it happen. Save your money, and your time! Don't watch it!"
2,Not what I thought,"I had been hearing about this movie for years and just recently watched it. At first I thought it was ""unique"". Followed general pagan beliefs pretty well. But after I saw the whole movie I could not understand why everyone talked about it. I thought it was horrible."
4,A Must-See for Modern Pagans,"Ever wonder what the world would look like if the Old Religion and its philosophy saturated modern culture? The Wicker Man is the Pagan ""Rocky Horror Picture Show."" Edward Woodward is wonderful as the up-tight bullying ""Christian copper"" and Christopher Lee (yes, of Hammer Dracula fame) gives us an educated, sophisticated (and manipulative) Pagan lord of the people. However, I was disappointed in the ending -- just what is the ""right kind of sacrifice?"""
1,DON'T BUY THIS DVD,I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS DVD SET. THIS IS A TERRIFIC MOVIE IN ITS ORIGINAL VERSION. THE VERSION YOU DO NOT GET IN THIS SET. YOU GET THE HACKED UP 84 MINUTE RELEASE AND THEN THE EXPANDED VERSION WICH IS STILL NOT THE FULL 103 MINUTE RELEASE. I AM SENDING MINE BACK ASAP.ANCHOR BAY USALLY DOES A MUCH BETTER JOB OF GETTING OUT THE CORRECT VERSION OF A FILM. THEY REALLY DROP THE BALL ON THIS ONE. WHAT A SHAME.
1,The 88 minute version is the one you DON'T want to see,"In its initial release, THE WICKER MAN was cut by 11 minutes, and scenes were shifted out of order. The result is a near incomprehensible mess. That appears to be what this disc contains.Instead, seek out the 1979 restoration (around 95 minutes) or the Canal Plus/Anchor Bay release of a reconstructed 99 minute director's cut version. After seeing the film, read the Wikipedia article ... THE WICKER MAN is one of the great overlooked horror/suspense films of the 20th century."
5,One of my all time favorite movies,"Not really a horror film, although that is where you will find it listed in any video stores that carry it. The highly edited version does not make sense but if you can find the long version (about 103-111 minutes) it is well worth the search. The dialogs between Woodward and Lee are great."
4,A review of the original american release (88 mins),"I had always heard the original ""The Wicker Man"" was a classic horror movie. I just recently saw the travesty of a remake with Nicolas Cage, and decided to see the original. I have to say the original makes a lot more sense and was by far the better movie in every aspect. The tale is one of mystery and faith, Christianity vs. paganism. The scene between Lord Summerisle and Sergeant Howie absolutely makes the movie. The scene with Willow trying to seduce the detective has to be one of the sexiest things ever on celluloid and manages it without being trashy. Christoper Lee and Edward Woodward are spectacular as the leads and Brit Ekland is absolutely beguiling as Willow. I did see the 88 min American release, which did seem to have some unexplained plot points, especially regarding Ed woodward's character Sgt. Howie but I am told there is an extended version that fills in some of the holes. I definately hope to see that version in the near future."
5,Disturbing Metaphors,"Sorry to use a non film comparison but The Wicker Man is the cinematic version of Brueghel's painting ""Carnival Versus Lent"". The Christian reviewers seeing this film as indicting Paganism misunderstand it in the same way various modern Pagans have thought of The Wicker Man as a celebration of Paganism. In reality, it takes an existentialist approach showing the hypocricy of all beliefs and I would hardly call that dated. Not just the music (haunting English ballads with bawdy themes) but all the imagery is so evocative that each viewing brings up more intuition. Just as significant as The Seventh Seal but a hell of a lot more entertaining and a lot less pretentious. Its too bad that the only way to get the extended version of dvd is in the special edition box. Either way, make sure to see the extended version which is the way the movie was meant to be seen."
1,"IF YOU HAVEN'T RENTED WICKER MAN YET, THERE IS STILL HOPE","This movie ought to be shown in film school as a warning to the students. It is basically a compilation of anything that can possibly go wrong in a film. If there is a theatre in hell, this is the movie that is playing. I am strongly urging you not to rent or buy this movie. No one (no matter what their sins) deserves to watch such a poorly made movie."
1,The worst movie I have ever seen,"Without a doubt this is the worst movie I have ever seen.Horrible story, pointless acting, a torture to watch."
2,Most Predictable Ending Ever,"One of the most overrated movies of all time. It is worth a watch for the nudity and seeing Britt Ekland, and really isn't that bad of a movie, but to ranked as a great film by anyone is crazy. It's definitely creepy, but I knew after the first 10 minutes what was going to happen. There is no horror and no suspense, just creepiness. The 5 star reviews must be from pretentious film geeks who only follow whatever is ""cool."" That being said, don't waste your money on the film, but watch it on cable if there is nothing else on at the time."
1,THIS IS BY FAR MY LEAST FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME,What can I say? This movie is worse than Lepraucan 4. Need I say more
1,Original films are not always the best,"We enjoyed the Wicker man remake with Nicholas Cage better than this original... despite the reviews. This was a typical 60's like flower child 'hippy' song and dance act with a lot of very slow evil lurking in the back ground that never seemed to develop. This could have been beter as an afternoon soap opera series like the original 'DARK SHADOWS'...very slow, never really getting to the point. Poor acting, poor script..not worth a dollar even if you find it at your local ""GOODWILL"" store."
5,Everything you need to know about riding the rails and more,"Sean meets a ""good"" hobo and listens to his tales of Red Dragon, a ""bad"" hobo, and this is the beginning of Sean's search for the ""bad"" hobo while riding the rails himself. This was a page turner from start to finish."
4,perfect hero,"series very good abd received in good condition.I would also like to say that the video I purchased Hit the Deck, was also received in very good condition and very promptly, unlike some earlier videos which were pretty poor condition.Claire Joyce"
3,Disappointing,"I have long searched for a book that would explain and describe Native American religions. Unfortunately, this author made this book as much of an angry diatribe as an explanation of Native American religion."
4,Aztec Two Step,"I just finished listening to See It Was Like This,and it sent me back to my college days when they came and poured their souls out in concert. I bought their cassette and played it over and over.However this version is just different enough to make me want the original version. If anyone knows how to find it I would appreciate hearing from you."
4,"See, It Was Like This","I love all kinds of good music, especially Folk Rock music, so I would like you to keep me inform and recommend any good music for me, thanks."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"Similar to the Daughter book, this contains awful ancient advice. A parenting magazine or web site will offer you better information. And there's nothing cute other than the cover. Nothing sentimental either."
5,"Great movie, great seller.Got here quick.",A good movie to see especially if you saw the newest version with Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore. It fills in som of the gaps and you get to see the real big and little Edie.
1,"Watching a train wreck is not ""fascinating"" or ""entertainment""","I was really looking forward to this film, as documentaries are my favorite genre and this topic seemed like it would be riveting. I thought that there would be a narrator and that the movie would tell the story of this house and the two women who live in it. Unfortunatley, it is a sad and distrubring film which contains only the ramblings of the two women in the house. They both seem so out of touch with reality (mentally ill? dementia? both?) that I never got a feel for what their real story was. Watching their ramblings and yelling at each other was not at all entertaining or stimulating. It felt like staring at a car accident or other calamity--a violation of the privacy of people whose sad lives should not be viewed in a voyeuristic manner. I realize that this is what reality tv is today--and that is why I avoid such fare. I was so disappointed with this film--it was not at all what I was expecting."
3,Not quite as good as I had hoped.,"I bought the two disc collection and watched both this weekend as well as all the bonus material. These two women are interesting and easily watchable when they are alone, but when they are together, which is most of the time, they are annoying as hell with all their bitching at each other. I really preferred watching it with the commentary on. I had to laugh when one of the editors said how unselfconscious little Edie was. Seriously? She fiddled with her clothes and that damn head scarf/towel/sweater thing on her head the whole time. I think she was bald or nearly so. She did say something like ""if I had hair"".I was hoping for a ""Brothers Keeper"" type of story but it was more like someones bad home movies. I still give it 3 stars though. It's hard to look away from a train wreck."
5,Awesome people study,"This movie was so engaging. The mother and daughter had such different memories of the same events. Each told their recollections which such conviction, I was unable to judge which one was telling the truth. It may be neither of them."
1,"Odd: Yes, Good: No.","This documentary shows two annoying old biddies (relatives of Jackie Onassis) in their vermin infested and falling apart 75 room mansion on Long Island. Ok, so they're insane, they're related to Jackie O and their once beautiful place is trashed.We are never given any real biographies of the two women, other than hints of singing and/or stage work here and there. It was distracting trying to figure out why anyone would even care about these two. Nor are we given any real history of the mansion.Without the history, there's nothing interesting about these lunatics other than the Jackie O connection. I'd rather have seen a documentary on the racoons in the attic.This film is essentially a train wreck for intellectuals looking for camp that's not as mainstream as, say, Beavis and Butthead.Personally, I'd take Beavis any day.If nothing else, this film will make you want to clean your house, which is pathetic if you're the filmmaker."
4,Grey Gardens Bio,Incredible Story.. Whatch this before the new HBO film..You will give Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange a high five for their outstanding performances..
5,Magnificent character study,These works make the viewer feel as if he is looking through a knot hole in a fence into a very private world. A simply remarkable character study of the lives of two unique women. You will not be able to look away. Brilliant film making.
3,Streaming was interrupted.,"The content/story was interesting, but very sad. My rating is based on the fact that we lost interest & became frustrated with trying to watch the final (approx.) 1/3 of the documentary, which was constantly breaking up and buffering."
2,A Trip to Nowhere,"Grey Gardens obviously has a lot of fans. The documentary did nothing for me. It is the story of a mother (Big Edie) and her daughter (you guessed it, Little Edie) who are related to Jackie Kennedy. They live in a rambling, decrepit house in the Hamptons on Long Island.Little Edie has severe mental problems. She tells stories about her life that may or may not be true. The Edies are both codependent and engage in vicious fights. Occasionally, an outsider comes by and observes their weird behavior. That's it - nothing else happens in this film.The directors deserve credit for allowing the Edies to tell their own stories. However, the lack of a narrative causes Grey Gardens to meander along the road to nowhere."
5,Original Grey Gardens document,Unreal how close Drew Barrymore got Little Edie. The original brought tears to my eyes and gave me a shocking view of the Rich and Famous. I highly recommend this whether you saw the remake or not.
5,S-T-A-U-N-C-H,"This is a piece of Americana to be appreciated on so many levels. Come one come all: lovers of documentaries, fans of the Maysles brothers, Kennedy afficianados, lovers of kitsch...this movie has something for everyone."
2,GREY GARDENS,Pretty much the same thing for the entire documentry. Could have done it in 20 minutes. Very depressing doc. Very sad people.
1,stinky,Like a really bad reality show. extremely boring and amateurish. I can't believe people actually watch this crap. save your money and go watch something more entertaining like watching paint dry
3,Grey Gardens,"Very interesting account of two women entrapped in enmeshment. This happens in a lot of families, and usually never reviewed because neither party is famous enough! Although sad in a way, I feel neither mother or daughter were unhappy or lonely. It was just their way of coping, and who is to say what exactly is unhealthy here----remember they had no funds. And money covers a multitude of sins and eccenticies in many ways! Rock on world! This story reminded me of my own Grandma and my dear Aunt. I loved them both, but they had their own way of dealing with the world, and who is to say they were wrong?"
2,boring,"After watching the HBO special on Grey Gardens, I just had to watch the documentary. I found it tedious and boring."
2,This must have been a film students Class Project,"Howard Hughs is the only person, I can think of that might like to see this film, These women are trapped in each others past, I think it might go over well in a film school setting to teach future directors of how to produce and write , There was no real plot, The only thing I got from it was that Eddie is slowly going mad that she gave up her life to care for her mother, who should have been better aquainted with the Kennedy's as part of thier family to at least mooch a full paid room at a nursing home. I felt desperately sad for the younger Eddie, as depression from loss of interaction of a real life is driving her mad. To the writer and directors credit, the senior nuding and sentimental moments between the mother and daughter were worth watching it to the end."
1,Grey Gardens,Grey Gardens is one of the worst films that I have ever seen. Wish I could say something good about it.
4,"It's Good, But......","I have to wonder if these women would have gained the attention and their iconic status if they had not been related to Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis. Quite frankly, there are many homeless people who have similar stories to the Beales' and act quite like the Beales did, but they are treated like trash and kicked to the curb. They either didn't have any rich relatives who could bail them out by refurbishing their home for them to the tune of $32,000.00 plus or they were offered help and, for whatever reason, turned it down. No one is filming them, no one is offering them gigs at the local cabaret---because they aren't ""connected"" to the right people.This is an interesting character study, but as someone else said in these reviews, watching it becomes an uncomfortable experience. You feel like your viewing someone's mental instability as entertainment."
5,Love the Beales,"I had this on DVR....recorded it from Showtime. Then my DVR burnt out, and I lost about a half dozen shows that I loved. This was the first DVD that I ordered to replace what I lost. I love Grey Gardens, and especially Little Edie Beale, and I think this video is awesome. I'm glad to get it back, because I still watch it, or parts of it, when I take my afternoon ""break"". It's an oldie but a goodie......"
2,"Horrible, boring, depressing",Nothing like watching two people who have gone insane by dwelling on what was and what could-have-been to make you realize the importance of living with purpose in the present!!
2,Turned it off half way through.,"Only a voyeuristic wanna be film maker could find this a 5 star show. A sad inside look at two women who obviously must have some deep inner demons. Of course the only reason for this documentary being made is the connection with the Kennedy family but there is little to none explanation made to the history or connections of these two very sad lives. If you enjoy spending an hour or two watching uncomfortably sad portrayals of a couple of women who fell from high society only to become the crazy lonely hermit living ""aunts"" then you might find this enjoyable. I only found myself squirming with the pony show these women were made into and left with no insight of the history of their story."
4,A Personal History,"I saw this film at it's premiere, because as a curious 7-9 year old, I considered the Beales friends during the summer. Family of mine owned the house across the street, and Grey Gardens was the haunted house on the corner on the way to Georgica Beach.In the film, the house is somewhat cleaner (if you can believe it) than when I was there. I can remember singing "" I can't give you anything but love"" over the phone to Lee Radziwell, who I remember meeting once on the porch during a rare visit. I walked up the stairs barefoot, but mistake once. I had made it into their confidence. I will never forget the previlege of being welcome into the inner sanctum. Cat crap between my toes into Mrs. Beale's bedroom.... she liked me. Where as my sister Alexis was Miss Beale's favorite.The film does show the desperation quite accurately."
4,Absorbing,"It's like watching a train wreck - you're repulsed, and yet you can't look away. A fascinating look at the inter-relationship of a mother and daughter bonded together by fate and apathy. Glimpses of what were and what could have been pepper this documentary, while the camera records the decay of the house, as well as the decay of the lives of the Beales. ""Little Edie"" gained a cult following which exists to this day, and this film will go down as a classic. It's weird, it's disturbing, it's a must-see."
3,Precede With Caution,"This was a difficult documentary to watch and in fact I was unable to finish. That is not to say that this movie is not interesting, in fact it fascinated me at first but eventually I felt the same sickening sensation you might get if you were to watch someone commit self-mutilation. In this case these two women, mother and daughter, find themselves connected in a destructive cycle of self-loathing and co-dependency as their live slowly erode like the house around them. This movie would be an interesting study for anyone in the mental health field, all other precede with caution."
5,The set to get. Groundbreaking documentaries.,"These two documentaries are some of the most entertaining pieces of film I've ever come across. The women can go from endearing and adorable to frightening in half a second. The entertainment never stops. The stories they tell are wonderful and the fights are like train wrecks. The point is that these films, if watched with open mind and heart, leave you feeling connected to the Beales. Albeit most appreciated by those with an outsider mentality. This is the set to get as The Beales of Grey Gardens is just as good as Grey Gardens."
1,Said silk tie....it was polyester,This was advertised as a silk tie. But it is polyester. I do note the title sayd red polyester ties but down below (where I saw it) it definitely says SILK.Beware!
1,Don't waste your money,"Please don't waste your money with this. You are better off getting free cliff notes or book rags. This was a terrible disappointment and a total waste of money. I am a teacher and we are reading this novel. I expected this to supplement my teaching. Instead, it is filled with literary mumbo-jumbo that is totally pointless."
1,Piece of Junk - dont buy,"I purchased this cable thinking because it was a sony product that it would be as the TV's, how wrong I was. After 4 weeks of using the cable, it died. I then purchased a monster cable and it has worked perfectly!! (Its worth extra money!!)"
3,not bad,"A thoroughly enjoyable history of the greatest revolutionary party in the history of the Republic. Very readable. However, I was irked by several factual errors, which, in my opinion, are inexcusable in a history book. (For example, former GOP Minority Whip Bob Michel was from Illinois, not Indiana. Richard Nixon died in 1994, not 1993. There are several others that struck me while reading but that I cannot recall now.) One my consider such factual mistakes as ""no big deal."" However, I cannot help wondering what other errors there are that I am just not aware of."
3,silver ring,"This product is good. I enjoy it, its pretty and got here really fast, was exactly what i had wanted. But my only problem with it is that after i've worn it in the shower a few days the silver started coming off and not its just kinda an ugly grey color around some of the edges."
3,THERE IS A NEWER EDITION OF THIS BOOK,"NOTES THAT THE 6TH edition is now available in the ohio website ,,,why amazon is lagging .6th edition is rleased in 2011 and with new updates ."
5,A reader from Malaysia,"Simply the best rock memoir I ever read. And I have read most of them! Rick Wakeman surprises me with this newly revealed talent. Warmth, humour, insight, true experience. Though I am not generally a fan of progressive music, Rick's ""King Arthur"" album is still the best classic/rock fusion album ever made. And it is saddening to hear that he once had to sell off the rights to it!!! At one point, Rick was the only composer that could challenge Andrew Lloyd-Webber's dominance in the late 70s & 80s. Once, he even teamed up with Tim Rice, though he has shown that he probably could have written the storyline and lyrics himself. In the book you will understand the reason why he eventually failed. The conflict between composing and playing. He had a passion for both, but he couldn't do both at the same time."
3,Worth a read.,"Rick Wakeman has always seemed to be a very nice person. That could be seen by how he was on the Yes Years videocassette. I finally got around to reading this autobiography from him and must say that it was pretty good. I was a bit surprised at how short it was though, but long or short, it was still quite interesting in places. I admit that I expected to read a little more about Yes, but he never really went into that much detail really. I didn't know that Rick Wakeman had gone through so much trouble in his life before I read Say Yes though. I wasn't totally impressed or glued to this book, but I still think that is worth a read. Say Yes just proved to me even more that Rick Wakeman is a really likeable person that happens to be a great musician also."
5,"A very , very good read/listen",This is a book based on a true story. It happens to be a story about a dear friend who I went to high school with many moons ago. Very glad to have this. It arrived in a timely manner
1,this film is bacon!,"Oh my god this was horrible. Do not believe that first review. ""What more could you ask for?"" I know what more I could ask for: some acting talent. Some of the people in the film are so bad that I could not watch them act and breathe normally at the same time. Also, a story, a script, a plot and a point would probably help too. The stunts in this film are the worst that I have ever seen. Please don't bother seeing it for yourself to find out. Some mysteries are better left unsolved!"
2,not good,"i hate to say this, but this masking tape is no good at all. it is so thin, it tears a lot when you try to pull some out, and when i got a long 1 inch ribbon from it i gave up. didn't masking tape used to be thick and reliable?"
1,Leaked,"We had a problem with our tape leaking. We taped off the walls to work on the trim, but the white paint soaked through the tape and now our blue walls are all spotty."
3,Not bad for the price,"I bought these earrings for my fiancée to replace a lost set of real diamond earrings. They looked outstanding!! She was very happy. A few days later, the back fell off of one, we repaired it, then a day later the other one fell out completely. Be careful with these, they fall out easy."
4,Good Deal. Best for Breakfast.,"A small skillets set, bought at $25. I love to use it to cook eggs. Quite durable if you don't over heat (I kill my last calphalon skillet by heat!) or stratch it."
4,Beautiful history & refrence of bottles,"This book is lavished with the most magnificent perfume bottles and their pacaging. full color photos of Lalique, Baccarat, and other exquisite bottles along with the histories of the fragrance companies who commissioned them. There is also an index of these companies for quick refrence. I found the title missleading. the author is of the belief that the ""art of perfume"" died 30 years ago. All of the bottles are from the late 1800's to the 1960's and I feel that the title should have mentioned this. If you collect antique bottles or are looking for a good fragrance history book, this is a must."
5,A very nice and interesting book,"I know that the writers are savvy perfume bottle collectors. They have incorporated years of experience into this book. That is the reason why that among all the books on this subject, this one is the most appealing. I have also used part of her materials (w/permission) to write my book (published in Chinese)."
1,Where's the DeVilbiss??,"I can't believe the good reviews on this book! They must be all friends of the author or something. This book should really be named ""All the Perfume Bottles That You'll Probably Never See & Could Never Afford"". Yes the pictures are well done & it's interesting for a flip through, but these bottles are so high end you'll never encounter them in a yard sale, auction or flea market. And how can you have a book without any Steuben or DeVilbiss?? Not even a page! Not even a mention!! What a waste! Not a book for a fortune hunter. Maybe I'll use it when I win the lottery. And no comments about those aberrations from Avon. Avoid if your looking for a reference book!!"
2,Kindle Version Feedback,"The content in this book deserves better formatting. The code samples are in font so small and embedded as images. The result is that the ""Zoom"" feature helped little, and the code required being tethered to the laptop. I could not use this book for more than an overview. Disappointing to see that the publisher did not use text for the code."
4,Probably a great book,"i bought this book because of the positive reviews it recieved. unfortunately the entire book is fo C# developers, while im a VB only.Though I have no use of the sample code cause its all in c (there's a VB version available for download on the net, but it is not officialy supported by the author), I am reading this book and thoroughly enjoying the general concepts he reviews.Disregarding syntax, the book has very much theory and discussions of design problems which will be useful for any web developer. he actually does a very thourough job of explaining the different options you have for each major step in project development.its only a shame there was no mention of the fact that its c only. a 0 star to amazon on that part.i'll put it this way, would the book have been in VB i would have definitely recommended it."
5,Simply BUY IT,"My previous professional experience took me to develop (part of) an Enterprise Application based on ASP.NET 1.1 . They were hard days when I started with ASP.NET 1.x and docs were too few to understand all at first shot.Finally, class by class, pages by pages, my Web Developing Experience with .NET grow up.Now, that ASP.NET 2.0 is out, the Application I wrote has to be ported and I don't need a ""Learn-from-scratch"" book for this new version but something that brings you directly ""to the point"".ASP.NET 2.0 Website Programming IS the book I was looking for!Simply follow you from requirements to the solution going step by step and in a VERY CLEAR way (no ""I skip this argument as you already know about"" paragraphs present).Everything you need to understand new features from ASP.NET 2.0 is in the book: the ""The Beer House"" site grow chapter by chapter and, at the end of the book you know ALL you need to port the knowledge in your daily work.[...]"
2,Difficult to follow,"I would have loved to have seen this book as a learning tool to programming the site. But in essence this book is more a means to identify potential design issues, and what the author thinks are good ways to go about doing things. I found it extremely hard to run the code, maybe a chapter by chapter breakdown of code would have been handy, but if i ever get stuck at some point, then i was lost. This book doesnt have the exact code and explaining what the code should do, and how it goes about doing it, so in essence, it was really a try to figure it out yourself kinda deal. I found it a mess."
2,Could have found a tutorial online...,"Though reasonably well written it is really just a tutorial that I could have found as easily online. Note quite what I had hoped for in a book on Problem, Design and programming. I had hoped for better detail on the design approaches and methodologies than were gotten here.In short, not a book that I expect to open a lot if ever again."
1,Good reviews - bad book,"I bought this book because of the rave reviews. Once I began to read, however, I found it disappointing. Explanation and examples are vague and/or incomplete. The author should be forced to take a basic writing course before he is allowed to write anything more then a letter. Shame on the editors for letting this type of document out under the guise of instruction."
3,Not really what i was expecting,I disliked this book. I expected more type an examples on how to fix some of the problems with coding.
4,C LOVELY,"I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE SONG ""LOVESTRUCK""THATS Y I WANT THIS ALBUM ALTHOUGH I WOULD PREFER A CD."
2,Bought wrong filter but seller wouldn't allow return after 10 days,"I had bought parts in advance in anticipation of winterizing tractor.I didn't install for about 45 daysWhen I went to install I realized I had ordered the wrong air filter (My fault)When I wanted to return it the seller reminded me that the parts had to be returned within 10 daysIn this day and age of excellent customer service, I expected moreI likely won't buy from this seller again - Their return policy sucks - It is out of sync with the real world"
5,"Ruth Kern makes the world a better place, July 15, 2000",We have enjoyed and benefited from Ruth Kern's video. We have also shared it with our Chinese friends as they prepare for their diplomatic assignments in the United States. They are most happy to have such an educational tool.
2,Speech writing,I bought this to help students write speeches for various events. It bogs down and is a slow read so I wouldn't suggest buying it unless you're heading for political speeches as an adult.
1,disappointing,"based on the reviews, I was hoping for more. This book offers only obvious pieces of advice, and furthermore, the author doesn't seem to have the background to be considered an expert in the field. Perhaps I should have done more research, but I was hoping to read a book by someone that has written significant speeches and not just speeches that were read at business conventions or the local rotary club.I knew little about speech writing before reading this book, and after reading it, I still know little."
3,Title May Be A Misnomer,"I read this book (every single word of it!) when it first came out more than ten years ago. Do I believe everything espoused in Ageless Body, Timeless Mind? No, of course not. I do, however, believe that the power of the mind is all encompassing, and this, I think, is the the message in Dr. Chopra's book. Not a new concept, but one which we seem slow to embrace.I continue to be inspired by Dr. Chopra. His works are not enjoyed by everyone....so thank Heavens for the library!"
3,No easy path,"I believe one of the quotes in this book ""People don't grow old. When they stop growing, they become old"" illustrates what Chopra is helping to bring in this world of ours. In another way he is explaining what Dr Bruce Lipton has been able to show through science that Epigenetics is what determines how we age and how we will fare with our health. But through meditation, right living and awareness we can live a life of fulfillment that medicine can not offer us. It takes courage to step outside of the traditional paradigm and Chopra does it so well.Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
1,"Tired Book, Careless Author","I wanted to like this book, but was sorely disapointed.Most of the studies cited were either irrelevant or suffered from cronic statistical manipulation.He talks about people being able to live ""... up to two hundred years old..."" with basically no proof.In fact, most evidence is to the contrary. There are quite a few enlightened people in the world (many Buddist monks) but none of them live that long. Even the people cited in the book as ""masters"" all died before they reached 100.We need a book with new thinking, not recycled mumbo-jumbo."
3,Another expert can't follow his own advice.,While I think the book has potential and clearly his concepts seem to have merit the big missing piece is not just knowing good concepts but practicing them. Have you seen this guy lately? Is he the embodiment of health? He is overweight and moves slowly. Advice that can't be practiced by the giver is weak advice. Enough of Deepak and Dr. Phil telling us to how to live healthy when they can't seem to do that themselves.
3,"ok, but there are better",for all the talking this man does he never mentions books pertaining to chi and the way in which it flows through all living and non-living matter. the real key to aging and living plentifly lies in living every day to its fullest by utilizing key energy.
2,A definitive pile of....,"What is this guy talking about? Is this a way to approach the real world? All of his ideas, what does he base them on? I have only one good thing to say about it, it is definitely a pile of ----!!!"
3,Clinical Proof,"I respond to the reviews below, stating there is no practicality to the novel. The paradigm of information to usefull, depends on how intellectual and closed minded we are. Aging is thought of as a physical manisfestation, so one must realize that one's disbelief will make one's mind think that aging is purely physical. BUt what makes me know this for sure, well knowledge from (quote)Above(unquote) and those I have met (quote)200 years old(unquote). So in the book, there are dozens of hard to believe stories, so the questions lies in your stronghold of disbelief. Just let go of what's hindering you...sorry to be so vague and so self evident <but> u know, I write forever."
3,"Ageless Body, Timeless Mind","Some very interesting information and concepts in this book, however, I did not close this book feeling more enlightened that before reading the book. If you have a strong religous background, you probably know most of the concepts in this book although you may increase your terminology on subjects such as quantum healing and ayurveda. The book is good for anyone who wants has a negative view of aging and wants to improve the quality of their life as they age."
4,Required reading for baby Boomers,"Ageless Body, is one of those books you can't put down and you find yourself thinking about it through the day. It increased my awareness of how I view my world, allowing me to make adjustments in my life that moved me closer to my true wants and needs. Another book that deals with some common problems in a fast paced society (no purpose, joy, peace or time and too much anxiety, stress and fear) is ""It's About You"" by E. S. Smith. If you are still searching, don't know what you need to make your life satisfying, then you might want to check it out.E.S. Smith"
1,New-age recycling.,How should I put it?Take care of yourself.Your body might last a bit longer.Your mind might last a bit longer.Does it have to be presented as mystical ancient knowledge?
4,Good book that details Holistic approach to living longer,"I enjoyed reading this book. Another book by the same author- 'Grow younger, live longer: 10 steps to reverse aging' is a practical guide to implement what Ageless Body,timeless mind talks about. I highly recommend readers to read the later."
3,Good information but poor presentation,"Deepak Chopra is normally a very good instructor and I have enjoyed some of his other works a great deal. This program had good information however the presentation was monotone and made me tired. I tried to listen to it a few times before I made it all the way through. The rythum that he speaks with on this tape is almost hypnotic and I could hardly stay awake. The information was good and thought provoking. If this is a program you really want, you may want to get the book and avoid the tape or CD. Overall Deepak Chopra is great, this one didn't meet his normal mark. Try his (Seven Laws) CD, it's fantastic."
1,overpriced,"The price is way, way overpriced! After I purchased them I saw them in Wal-Mart for .89 cents and since they were so much cheaper in Wal-Mart I purchased them again because the ones I bought from amazon cracked and I only had them for just two months! One arrived cracked in the box and I had to reorder, that should have been my first clue! Don't waste your money!"
5,sticks well,This glue worked well on my motorcycle grips just wih the tube was a little larger. The big thing is my grips aren't coming off any time soon
5,I love this EP!,"This is probably the best EP I own. It's only four tracks long, but every minute is pure quality. The second song in particular, ""Portraits Hung in Empty Halls"" is really emotional and catchy. I can't recommend ""Breathing Underwater"" enough! It's just a pity these guys aren't around anymore (although I've been told that their album isn't as good as this little gem).Not being familiar with anything else by this band, the best info I can give you is that if you like Alexisonfire or The Bled's ""Pass the Flask"" album, then you should definitely buy this."
5,works great,"this was exactly what we needed. twin pole (2 pole) 30 amp (the 30 is written on both poles, but its 30 not 60(adding up)."
4,The Real Untouchables - A View of the Dedicated,"This documentary DVD is a very informative expose of the times of prohibition and what Elliot Ness was up aginst during those times. The details of the lives of the men it examines is worth the price of the video. This is not an exhaustive documentary of either side, but what it does cover is an education of what the federal government and in particular not one (Ness), but other dedicated crime fighters did to stop a real insideous infestation of crime in America. Check it out!"
2,Not a Keeper,The Real Untouchables is a DVD to watch only once; not over and over again. It was not worth it.
3,Read this if you want the real,"People need to know the real facts about the untouchables. If your like me you want to watch a truthful movie. Truth is Elliot Ness did nothing to stop Al Capone or the Chicago outfit. A mafia historian said that Elliot Ness couldn't find cheese in Wisconcin and that's a fact. He did nothin to bring the Chicago out fit down.Tom Dewey is the real untouchable, and even he was unable to bring the mafia to a full hault.Over all the movie gets a sympathetic 3 stars, mostly for insleading info."
2,not right size,"just got these bowls and construction seems good and dandy, but theyre not 20 oz as stated more like 16 oz and thats filling it to the rim which i doubt anyone does when feeding there pet."
2,Like and Dislike At The Same Time,I like the product however once I washed the comforter the colors ran. I tried contacting the merchant about this and have yet to hear back. Aside from that (which is a major issue) the quality is good.
3,"Good Quality, But Stiff, Not Soft","This comforter set is definitely good quality. It feels sturdy and well made. However, the comforter top (the red part) is made of canvas. It feels just like a canvas sail and is very stiff and hard. It's not at all comfortable to sit on or lay on and is very hard to maneuver (like for bending back to put a child into it or trying to tuck it in along the wall). You can't snuggle up with it at all. I haven't washed it yet--I'm afraid to after seeing the reviews about the colors bleeding. But unless it softens up significantly when washed, I dislike it other than for its looks. And it is definitely way too heavy and sturdy for spring/summer. I will have to try to find a blanket to match this set that is lighter weight and more comfy to the touch."
4,"File - Creates Upbeat Album with ""Two Left Feet""","I first heard this band at Buffalo Gap Internatl. Folk Dance camp in the 80's. Back then, their music was relatively unknown outside of Louisiana. Now, Cajun & Zydeco has swept the country. ""Two Left Feet"" is one of those upbeat Cajun albums that energizes you especially after a long day at work. Plus including the words to the songs enhances the fun. Like their other album, ""Cajun Dance Band"", this album is versatile to let you do the jittery bug easily. File is one of the better Cajun bands whose albums you'll always enjoy."
5,Great guide for American Flyer Trains.,This is a good starter book that gives you an idea of what your old American Flyer Trains are worth. Personally I would just keep them because they do not make these trains any more.
2,Almost nothing you couldn't find elsewhere,"I got this book since it was required for a UI class. I read it cover-to-cover before class started to get ahead, and was thoroughly disappointed. There are a few interesting things, but nothing a good professor won't cover in just as much detail in class (and will likely do so in a more useful, applied manner). Quite honestly, this is a boring read lacking quality information, and I have since sold the book. Compared to my love of the networking, os and compiler books, my appreciation for this book is nil. I keep Software Engineering 8 around since it is a useful resource in many ways, and even that book trumps this UI book by far. I would personally avoid buying this book if possible."
1,Verbosity at its finest,"This book looks more like a collection of references than a real text book. The author inserts references to other works and papers in such a random and repetitive fashion that makes reading the book a real pain in the ass.And then there is the verbosity. Apparently, Mr Shneiderman likes to list items and give examples. And he likes it a lot. If you make the terrible mistake of reading this book you will navigate through never-ending paragraphs that make circles and circles around the same idea, giving pointless examples of an anyways pretty obvious concept.This book is really bad. It looks like the author just copy-pasted the contents of his course slides and inserted some pretty pictures in the middle. Don't waste your money and/or your time with this one."
5,A great book!,"The 5th edition thoroughly updates and improves this valuable resource for students, professionals, and researchers interested in human-computer interaction. The presentation's coherent depth and breadth clarify how the interface mediates our access to information, and the need to match its design to our cognitive and perceptual capabilities. I was especially pleased that my colleagues Shneiderman and Plaisant included a chapter on information visualization also providing a rich list of references on this and other related fields. They make a convincing case for development of new information visualization evaluation tools. The 5th symphony, I meant edition, made me better aware of how mobile devices are changing our world and of the increasing power of YouTube, flickr and other social media. This is a great book!"
5,An irreverent look at life from a literary raconteur,"Judging from these often humorous, sometimes poignant, but always brash and candid letters, it is probably safe to assume that few writers have had such widely varied experiences as has Larry L. King. Spanning over 40 years, King's fascinating and provocative letters--along with his no-holds-barred reminiscences interspersed among them--provide a virtual autobiography of this novelist, playwright, essayist, and commentator. What makes this epistolary volume especially interesting is that King suffers no fools lightly, appears to be intimidated by no one, and is always ready to prick the balloons of the famous--and oftentimes pompous. (His accounts of working with actor Burt Reynolds and dancer Tommy Tune are particularly hilarious."
5,A fascinating view of a writer's life,"This book takes the reader inside the head and heart of a working writer and reveals the triumphs and the despair that are staples of a writer's life. There are a lot of famous people in it, too."
5,More great Harris comics,"Sidney Harris offers that rare treat: thoughtful, well-informed humor. This time he aims his barbs at the medical profession. His one-panel drawings cover the whole range, from surgery and office practice to psychiatry and research. If you really want to know what the mice and microbes think, let Harris be your interpreter.The end of the book came way too soon. That just means that I have to find more of his books - and don't ask to borrow mine. I keep coming back to them, and enjoying them all over again."
4,Wow!,What a beautiful and sexy product at an unbelievable price. My wife looked absolutely stunning in this. Gave it 4 stars just because it seems to be a pretty fragile fabric but for the price it is a steal and as far as looks go it is a 5.
4,Great,I ordered this to go under my red halter sheer baby doll. I was worried about the size but it fit with no problem and I'm a 2x.Wash by hand separately. When I washed the first time I got a lot of dye in the wash water.
4,good,"it is good and sexual lingerie, i like it,but i have long legs so it was bit little for my legs, i think it will be better if material was more stretchy..."
3,nice price,This thing is way too short for me I guess the girl on the picture make it look so good that you have to have it but if your over 5'8 i wouldn't get it.
5,More of the same,I enjoyed these stories as well - I didn't realize when I bought it that I already had one of the books included in Harmony. But they fit together.
1,This is NOT a new book. It's a re-release of old stories.,"I love the Jayne Castle series of books and look forward to each new release. I bought Harmony because I thought it was the newest release. Unfortunately, it's a repeat of an prior novel and an earlier short story version of a prior novel"
3,Good but misleading,I found that the title was misleading. It sounds like you will be getting a new story from this great author. But in fact it's a reprint of two different stories. Both stories are fantastic but are not new.
3,Harmony,"I didn't realize that this was actually a combination of the novella ""Bridal Jitters"" and ""After Dark"", the first book in the futuristic series. As I already had the other two, I wouldn't have bought this one if I had known that. Otherwise it would have been a good combination."
3,Harmony,It was not exactly what I thought it would be when I ordered it. I thought it would be more descriptive of the planet.
4,Castle/Krentz great,"The Book Harmony by Jayne Castle is actually 2 books that have been selected for this book. It contains the book ""After Dark"" and the novella ""Bridal Jitters"". So if you are a Castle/Krentz fan and already have these, then I would suggest bypassing this one. If you would like to purchase this as a gift to introduce someone to this great series this would be an excellent book to start them with or, if you are looking to fill in your series. If you are just looking for something to read without looking for the great American novel, this would be a great book, fun, light great characters."
3,Harmony the book is a planet of para-psychology adult fiction only,"Harmony is a planet of para-psychology and alien ghosts. The people that inhabit the planet were once from earth and were not able to go back and forth. Gifts of para-normal became part of what the people on the planet are born with, This is adult book with a little bit of sex. But it is a mystery story and a romance. Its not hard to understand and it is not a nasty ghost story."
4,Get Ye a Drink,"Not my favorite Cormac McCarthy novel, but a good first effort. To speak plain, I say one thing. Read all of his work"
3,a tough slog,"I've read all of CM's books, and most of them more than once. No author has meant more to me in my reading life. But,I admit, this is the McCarthy book that felt like work to read and was largely unsatisfying throughout I'm so glad I didn't start my reading of CM with this book. I'm not sure I would have gone any further. I am afraid I can only recommend this book to people who, like myself, just have to read everything he writes."
3,Mccarthy in his embryonic phase.,"As a lot of people have noticed, this partakes very heavily of the southern literary tradition. It IS a Faulknerian book, but you sort of have to cede those comparisons by default because, as his first published work, it isn't yet fully representative of the rich, dark style he really makes his own a few novels later. But even an OK Mccarthy novel is often descriptively gorgeous enough to make you not care too much. And you can definitely see flashes here of what he would go on to develop in Blood Meridian, Suttree, et al. And he's always been interested in writing about grizzled old men who don't belong in this age or not-yet-grizzled youths who have no choice. For a first novel, its pretty damn well sure of what it wants to be. Outer Dark is where things really take off..."
3,orchard?,the book was hard to follow in the beginning. kind of confusing. but it told a good story. written how someone would of spoke back then. cant really distinguish who the old man is at the start. but i liked it.
3,Mixed Reviews,"I must be reading McCarthy in the wrong order. Started with No Country For Old Men and loved it, his earlier books are much darker. Content was a bit confusing to me but the style makes you keep coming back for more."
4,Typical McCarthy - but that is a good thing,"Having read all of McCarthy's other books already, I came into this knowing what to expect as far a style and content. And I was not disappointed. McCarthy can better develop a character in two sentences than most authors can in two chapters. The vivid description of the mountains, the people, and their culture puts the reader right there in the story. These harsh, terse, and somehow always beautiful images will remain in my mind for a long, long time. I found this story a little more abstract than most of McCarthy's other works, yet I was able to see his message in the end. Required reading for any McCarthy fan."
4,Not For Speed-Readers,"This was McCarthy's first novel and already the signs of his talent were present. But, be warned, it isn't an easy novel to read and enjoy, despite its poetic beauty.The novel is not so much about its three main characters as it is about time and place and the threat of change. Uncle Arthur Ownby, the old man; Marion Sylder, the bootlegger, and John Wesley Rattner, the boy, interact but--as McCarthy infers--their destiny is ""myth, legend, dust"" while the land, the place, endures.Maybe I like the novel because it reminds me of people I knew and the place where I grew up, both of which have suffered the same consequence of time and change. It's not a novel for speed readers. It is one requiring attention, devotion to the beauty of words, particularly rare and unusual words, and willingness to accept the author's eccentricities as a different way of looking at things. It's not fast food for the brain but more a meal to be savored."
3,"like title says, for performance. Very dangerous when cold!","These hawk hps were for my 03 g35 coupe with the upgraded g35 dual piston brake from the 05-07 coupes. These pads great when is warmed up, but horrible when it is cold. For a everyday driver, just get oem pads, they work just as good when warmed up but work much much better when cold. Very dangerous, i rear ended someone on the freeway because of this during the winter.I live like 30 seconds away from the freeway so there wasnt much time for me to warm up the brakes. mostly my fault but brakes should have stopped better than an old rinky dinky minivan. right!?!?!"
4,Disappointing reprint of classic,"This is a terrific book, clever and rollicking and inventive and funny and haunting and all those good adjectives. But this edition is terribly disappointing; the text is set in a proportional font, which makes all the ""concrete"" games and shapes look cheesy. The pages (spoiler alert?) where the text is run together with no spaces between the words, for instance, are significantly easier to read in this edition, and a great deal is lost because of it. Try to hunt down a copy of the first (1971) edition if you can; this edition is a dim shadow of that one. (Hence the 4 stars -- really I'd give this edition much less but it is a five star book and a poor job of keeping it in print is better than none at all.)"
5,Disturbing...,"Another great story from the master...Jessie is a normal girl. She paints and has friends and loves to laugh. The problem is there is a fat man who lives in her apartment building. Like a troll, he lives under the stairs. He subsists only on coke-a-cola- and cheese doodles. His fingers are stained orange from the junk food. He is unattractive and he smells. Despite all this, Jessie finds herself obsessing over the man. He keeps telling her that he has nice things to show her in his apartment. When she does break down and enter his place, what he has to show her will keep you awake for a week and make you never enter a stranger's house again. It's that disturbing.Thank you Mr. Martin.Relic113"
1,Completely dissimilar from his previous country blues!!,"Please do not buy this album!!! Boogie Bill Webb, who is reputedly an established practitioner of the country blues style, has here forsook the style in favor of a modern electric blues style. I'm a fan of his country blues stylings (of the acoustic variety) however on this album his occasionally childish and asinine lyrics are spouted over a cheesy and over produced bass and drum setup."
2,Not Recommended,"I've purchased/used several yoga dvds and this is by far the worst. I would describe it as ""pre-beginner."" It's very slow-moving, with a lot of religious overtones. If you're a Christian, I suggest you pass on this. It's also over-priced."
2,"Not what I expected, but it is a book on TWC...","For those thinking about buying this book. One word of caution, it is NOT specifically about TWC. It is more about creating a business from the ground up and ignoring critics, blah, blah, blah. I was hoping for a behind-the-sences type of book on TWC, but this is not the case. A pretty dull book IMO, but a great book if you're a business person."
2,What is your USP?,"What is your USP (unique selling proposition)? The Weather Channel is available 24 / 7 and ""saves lives."" Started by Landmark Communications based on a business plan from noted meteorologist John Coleman, The Weather Channel is a broadcasting success story. This book plods along with the story of the birthing of the service and not a lot of insight into the process beyond good people and a private company's ability to make the kind of long-term investment that paid off with The Weather Channel."
4,"The text is fine, but...","This is a good book. However, I was disappointed in the photograph section that shows only current, highly ""Hollywood"" style pictures of the anchors. There are virtually no ""behind the scene"" type photos. I was hoping to see some of the history of TWC and especially photographs from its humble beginnings - before the high tech stages and equipment."
1,Daryl Hall Concert,This was more like the Daryl Hall Concert than the Hall and Oates Concert. Daryl was front and center and John was a guitarist in the background. Vocals were very bad. Very off-key. Would not recommend even though I'm a big H&O fan. Very disappointed!
3,Unable to hit the high notes.,"Being a long time fan, I was waiting with great anticipation to play this DVD. Unfortunately the years have not been kind to Daryl's voice as he had trouble hitting or holding the high notes. However, having said this the performance still remained enjoyable."
4,Hall & Oats,"No one running around in their underwear...no gymnastics. Just two guys who can rockSong after song..when each is finished, I gasp and say WOW....what more can I say ? I can't believe that this would not rock even our tweenie boppers."
5,Great Buy,I got this for my husband because this show played when we weren't able to make it. So we were happy to at least get to watch it from a dvd.
5,Hall & Oates Live at the Troubador,"EXCELLENT music, video and fidelity. Highly recommend it even if you are not a Daryl fan as I am. One of my favorites."
5,Hall & Oates,"This is well worth the money. The song ""Sara Smile"" alone is worth the money. Be ready to listen for longer than usual."
3,I THOUGHT THIS WAS IN DTS-HD,"I MUST HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD THE SPECS ON THIS. I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I AM A BIG FAN FOR DTS-HDWELL ITS A GREAT RECORDING BUT MY COPY WONT DECODE IN THIS FORMAT BECAUSE THERE IS NO DTS OPTIONIT IS HD 5.1ONE OF THE BEST RECORDINGS I HAVE HEARD IN 5.1, BUT, IT IS TOO BAD THAT THEY DIDNT SPEND A LITTLE FOR THE 7.1 DTS FORMATBOTH THE AUDIO AND VIDEO ARE VERY GOOD BASED ON THE 5.1 SETUP"
5,So Good **Must have Concert BR**,"After reading all the Postive Reviews on this BRI bought it and I Completely agree with everyoneRegarding this Live Show on BRIt's a Must have Concert with Stunning True HD 5.1 AudioGreat PQ it was shot beautifully at times u feel like u are in the front rowThe performance was Flawless5 Star Set of 19 Classic SongsDaryl Hall and John Oats still make great music and still to this dayDon't get Nearly enough Credit for there workThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame needs to watch this Show and Induct them in the Hall of FameBest Concert BR Disc I've watched so farIt surprised me, Better then expected10/10"
5,Sure to be a winter favorite!,"Though I love anything that Susan sings, this compelation will surely fit into everyone's holiday collections. The song choices are nothing short of fabulous and will get you into the spirit of the season as soon as you press play. From Thanksgiving to Chanukah to Christmas and New Year's, there's a song for them all - and each is unique and completely faultless.My advice is to get cozy, sip a cup of tea, and sit back while Susan Egan and Christopher McGovern help you relax into the joys that the holiday season undoubtedly brings!"
5,Dick Mills Devotional volume 1,"This book is just perfect for me. I enjoy studing the Word and how Dick applies it. I like this volume so much, I've ordered volume 2! Rest in peace Dick!"
5,buy this kit,"Read any review and you know how great the BG-E3 is. The canon grip is of better quality than the off brands and only cost a bit more. But to get the BG-E3, two batteries, a charger, a lens cleaning kit, and a bag for only little more than just the grip itself, you have to get this kit. All of this is the same price, if not less,than an off brand grip and two batteries."
5,Quality and condition of items,I was surprised how quickly the items arrived.they were in perfect condition and well packed.They are a welcome addition to my Canon Rebel.Stan Tott
5,Good service Good price,I purchased the fogger to replace another make that stopped working after one summer's use. I had a Burgess before that and it lasted for years and gave good service. I hope this one does too!
2,Fuel still flows after trigger is released,"I bought this fogger in June 2012 after having owned a Burgess Fogger previously. I was pleased with service the first one gave, but I could tell with the first use of this new one that it was not the same quality as the one I bought about 15 years ago. The new one performed well two times, and then today (Sept. 2, 2012) when I used it the fuel would not stop flowing when I released the trigger. Even after setting the ""safety"" on the trigger, the fuel still flowed. My window to return the product expired in July."
5,Burgess insect fogger,I tried the black flag model fogger and it sort of worked twice then would not light up so I replaced it with the Burgess and it works every time.
2,Adequate,"Product works well until the fluid level gets to about 1/3 full. Once at that point the sump is not able to pick up the fluid well and generate the fog as required. It's OK, but not great. I would not buy this product again or recommend it to a friend."
5,Propane Foggers,I have been importing and supplying this product to Beekeepers in New Zealand for a number of years - used with Food grade mineral oil - for control of varroa mite in beehives. It works.The Burgess propane foggers seem to be robust and perform well - apart from a tendancy to blow out in breezy conditions.
3,"Good, but not good enough!","Wards off most bugs, but not enough and not for long enough. It also killed a good number of my plants."
3,"Great fogger, bad Insecticide","Fogger worked great, but the problem is the insecticide didn't work on the gnats. I'm looking at mixing my own product, hoping for better results."
2,would have given 5 stars if we hadn't gotten someone's return,it was very frustrating to open the package and see the space where the bottle of insecticide should have been. af
3,Reliable if you follow the instructions,"I've had this model for several years and it provided good service if you follow some guidelines:Keep the tank at least 3/4 full of fluidLet it warm up several minutes before pumping (when it smokes, its ready#Do not try to pump too fast or you will squirt a stream of fluid, not fogUse a sweeping motion on a windless dayClean out the end of the nozzle occasionally with a wire to prevent soot buildup and eventual coil cloggingDo not store liquid in the tank after useShort propane bottles work as well as the long onesFinally:Wear hand, eye and breathing protection #use a good mask, not a paper one)Keep pets away from the area until it driesI am about to get a new one since the last one was stolen. I only rated this a 3 because you have to fiddle with the gas bottles, lighting it, cleaning it, and so on. It's not a pick up and use tool, but better than sprays, candles, giant bottles killers, or those stupid neon light things."
4,Burgess Propane Fogger,Extremely fast delivery!Was familiar with this product but could not find it locally.Arrived in good condition and put it to work.mosquitoes are now in my neighbors yard.
2,Not as good as claimed,"I had used the Black Flag fogger for years until it stopped working. After researching it appeared that the Burgess would be better so I purchased it. However, I was disappointed by its performance. Compared to the Black Flag fogger it did not have an ignitor so you need a separate flame source. It consumed much more liquid for the area you are fogging and it did not put out the volume of fog either. It also does not shut off as easily. On the plus side it does appear to be better made with its own reservoir."
5,Doesn't clog if used correctly.,"I think this product is as good as any other on the market. If used correctly, it doesn't clog. Be sure to use early in the day and then at dusk.. which is sometimes difficult when a party is in full swing. but better than the alternative of getting eaten alive by the MASS Skeeters!"
3,Not the best fogger!,"Including this one I have owned four foggers; two Black Flag, a Hudson, and this Burgess. The Hudson is the best of the three. The Burgess is hard to lite and even harder to keep going if there is a breeze. Everytime I try to lite it I think it must be out of propane. The last time I spent 45 minutes doing a five minute fog operation. The pump seems to function better than the Black Flag fogger. The Hudson valve has to be turned down until it gets hot which is probably why it starts better than the Burgess. Companies can't make anything that requires brains to run them because someone with no brains is going sue them for it. If you don't have a brain the Burgess is made for you. If you have a brain buy the Hudson, crack the valve to lite it and turn it up as it warms up."
2,"Not ""Exact Fit""","When I was in the automotive business, I used Trico wipers regularly, and as I recall, they were good quality. These seemed to be decent quality, but not nearly the quality of the original equipment wipers on my Chevy Lumina.They definitely were NOT an exact fit for my car. They were close and probably would have worked ok. However, when I installed them, part of the retaining clip that secures the wiper blade on the arm broke. It seemed like it might hold on ok with part of the retaining clip secure, but then I thought about the wiper flying off my car at 65 MPH in a rain storm. So I returned both of them and went to the dealer, yes the dreaded dealer, to buy an original set, which turned out to be only $1.00 (one dollar) more expensive than the Tricos.So, my recommendation is to check with the dealer on price before ordering these and then make a decision on which to buy."
1,"so easy, but flimsy","Look very much like the OEM ones I took off of my Honda, easy to put on! I got them on in about 5 minutes and it was getting dark out side! Trico does not make bold claims, they just make a decent wiper and the one thing I really like is it comes just with the adapter for your car's mount instead of a mess of adapters for a lot of different vehicles. For this reason alone, I will keep buying these. Also, easy to get into the package and nicely packed.update January 2013, do not buy these, I hd to replace them in less than 3 months, the mechanism that holds them to the main wiper is flimsy and driver side one broke this morning."
4,GOOD BLUES,ERIC BELL ORIGINALLY THE GUITAR PLAYER FOR THIN LIZZYHAS COME UP WITH AGOOD BLUES ALBUM.HE REDOES THE ROCKER ATAT A SLOWER PACE AND IT SOUNDS GREAT.THE SONGS ON HERE ARETHE MOST REQUESTED AT A RADIO STATION IN MCALLESTER OKGOOD BLUES ALBUM.
3,"Very Informative, Poorly Designed","First off, it's almost 2006 and this book was written in 1994 (with the Mac OS6 screenshots to prove it). Most of the principles discussed in the book are timeless, but still, graphical interfaces have improved GREATLY since this book was originally written...The images in the book are very poor...some of them even look like 2nd or 3rd generation photocopies. Most screenshots are from operating systems that haven't been used for more than 10 years, when personal computers were still in their infancy...and before the internet even took off.Again, this book is well written and informative. Unfortunately, it's lacking a much needed revision and the images are almost unrecognizable."
3,"Good information, flawed by presentation","This book has a lot of great information, and the layout (of the information) is actually pretty good. Unfortunately, the density and otherwise poor quality of the prose and editing obscure this. I can't believe a book that costs this much, and whose focus is presentation, would have such glaringly obvious errors. I've never seen a book with so many typos. It also uses the incredibly wordy and verbose style often found in the art world, a technique that does not exactly help in demystification of a topic that surely needs it. The good news is that I was preparing a technical writing class as I was reading the book and it provided a ready source for exercises.A good rewrite of this book, with up to date examples, is overdue. In the mean time, if you can wade through the prose, the information is definitely there."
4,Lots of common sense with intriguing hints of something more,"There's something irritating about a book on graphical design of interfaces that refuses to use chapter numbers in the Table of Contents (or for that matter anywhere except the first page of each chapter) even though the text references them. Unfortunately the authors also fail in the contents to fully integrate these two aspects of design.The book really reads like two: examples of bad interface design, and a smorgasbord of interesting examples and tidbits from the graphic design lexicon. The former struck me as mostly common sense, while the latter just whet my appetite to read the sources in the bibliography.Overall: worthwhile looking at, but not something I would actually refer to while designing."
2,Not for 2006,"I wish I had spent time in the reviews section and noticed the commentary about the horrible graphics in this book!!For the price, I would have thought that even though it was written over a decade ago (multiplied by Internet time, that is a long time ago), they could have spent the time to create colored illustrations. It is painful to try to read about interfaces in such a poorly presented book. Talk about a broken mental model.It's worth $20, but not $60 --until they spend the time to update it into this century."
5,This book got me interested in design,I love this book! It shows examples of good and bad design and provides very readable theoretical background of cognition topics.
3,Good information but bad presentation,"The book has very good information, instructions and guidelines about user interface design. However, it is written and edited poorly. They use way too many words and complex sentences to explain their concepts."
3,trimmer,liked the idea of charger built in no cord but did not like the guard adjustment would not adjust short enough only to about a quarter on a inch
5,This is the REAL Alaska,"Hobo Jim tells it like it is! We are raw, real, and wild! He is our heart and soul and if you can't see him in person then you must have his music. We have carried his music around the world with us and everyone will find something that will call his soul and heart to sing. To know Jim is to love him. He is a wonderful person and a true poet. We consider him a friend and a true representation of the Alaska Spirit and soul. We LOVE him and know you will too!!! He is Alaska incarnate."
4,Overall Good for Pies,"I've had both great and not-so-great experiences with this book. The apple pie was absolutely incredible as were the tarts but the tart dough caught my oven on fire the first time (the recipe called for far too much butter which leaked out everywhere). Overall a good book. For beginners I would also recommend ""The Farmhand's Favorite Pies"" by Mr. David Butler since its recipes have never turned out bad."
5,Delicious,This cookbook is a real winner! Oh the delectable desserts inside... they are delish! Each tart & pie that I tried came out wonderful. Even the recipes my son and my husband baked came out fantastic! I've never had a miss with Williams-Sonoma cookbooks...neither will you. -Enjoy!
3,given as a gift,"I bought this as a gift for a friend's family since they had really liked an older version of this by Williams-Sonoma called Pies & Tart. I have to say that briefly perusing through this, that I like my older version better. More basic pies rather than the fancier ones that people rarely do. I would think that the recipes would be similar so perhaps it'll will be just as good. I know the peach pie and strawberry pie recipes from mine have been delicious. So, rating this a three since the verdict is out...but I can say the previous edition was worth 5 stars."
4,Terribly interesting,"A quick page-turner because it is so well written, but it presents very interesting look at law, justice and politics. I have an understanding of Normandy and France I would never have had otherwise. Recommended."
4,"Great product, but the shipping...",I got one set of this a few years ago from a store. I'd been wanting another set and was thrilled to see it here on Amazon. Unfortunately the set arrived with every single coffee mug broken. Luckily none of the other items sustained any damage so I didn't bother having the mugs replaced. The set itself is lovely and durable....but not apparently durable enought to survive whatever happened in the course of shipping.
3,love [product] ' n ' loathe [shipping],"I've owned this set for a few years, and have enjoyed it so much that I wanted more pieces. As I couldn't find it anywhere else, I ordered it from Amazon. Today I received it, but as mentioned by someone else, the packaging was horrible and pieces were broken. The dishes themselves are quite nice [I always get compliments] but the shipping seems to be risky."
3,Poor packing and shipping...,"The item is great and is definitely worth $30, but Amazon needs to work on their shipping department. I got one box in and it was in perfect condition. The next box was just full of broken plates, cups, bowls, etc. The sent UPS back to pick it up and sent me a new one, and it was the same way. That's 2 different shipments that seemed damaged before it was even shipped, because the UPS box wasn't damaged at all. Atleast, I got a refund, but having to go through all this trouble, I should have received the items for free.I probably won't order from Amazon again... Ebay is much more reliable."
3,voices in modern,I lvoe the four freshmen but this is not up to their usual standard. Their earlier albums were much better choice of songs too.
4,"Great, but they left off one song","""Voices in Modern"" was their first major album and ""Funny"" the last from their best period. They sound great on both, but you can hear how much they refined things over the years by listening to ""Funny"" immediately after ""Voices"". You can also clearly hear how audio production values changed in that time frame. My only gripe is that the last song on ""Funny"" is mysteriously absent from the CD."
5,I have played this over and over again...I love it and love the Four Freshman...your prices are competitive to I Tunes.,"see above I was in a hurry...I love the Four Freshman, this was the best of the oldFour Freshman..which Is what I buy."
5,This DVD keeps my daughter glued to her seat.,If u have kids u will not regret buying thus DVD. If they are like my kid you will have over an hour to get things done while they watch the show. One of my better purchases on Amazon honestly.
1,Defective,I had just bought a DVD player for my SUV and purchased this and 2 other DVD's to entertain my 2 year old on a 5 hour road trip. This DVD was defective. It would not load and I attempted it numerous times. Thankfully the other 2 I had purchased (another Olivia and a Mickey Mouse Clubhouse) worked great and they kept her occupied.
5,Resident Evil But For Kids.,This game plays alot like Resident Evil and im proud it dose because my son has wanted a Resident Evil game for so long and finally has a game that plays like it and that has no blood or gore or anything bad in it just mild slapstick and great fun plus its not that childish at all he has gotten scared a bit just playing it for a couple of minutes he has had alot of fun with this KEEP IT UP VIDEO GAME PEOPLE!
4,Hauntingly fun!!,"This is a good game for ages 8 and up. Although it might catch the attention of younger kids, it might be a bit too creepy and scarry for them. I say this because different than just watching the movie, your in control of the character's every move and there are many unknown nooks and crannies to look through which have unexpecting outcomes (The spooky music and sound effects don't help either). An example of what I am saying is such, I have a 5 yr old son and a 7 yr old daughter, they like to watch when I play the game but don't want any part of the control for themselves. More than half the time the end up leaving the room while I keep playing."
3,"Good customer service, average product...","I have owned and used my lousy Dell 720 since I got it free with a Dell computer purchase several years ago. I have always purchased very expensive new ink cartridges from Dell until it recently occurred to me that I might be able to find cheaper options at Amazon.I purchased this particular one with a bit of skepticism, which was confirmed shortly after receiving the product. It printed about four or five pages and was out of ink that quickly. However, I was pleased when I contacted the seller, and they sent me a replacement cartridge within days.The replacement cartridge has lasted for a few months, but it has definitely not lasted as long as the cartridges that I used to purchase from Dell.So, I think I'm going to try another seller to see if I can find one that lasts longer than this one. In any case, the customer service was quick and responsive, and the product worked well, just not as long as I had hoped."
1,messy,Do not recommend this unit unless you buy it from the store where it is made. They leak very badly when shipped.
2,weird,I couldn't even finish watching 1st show.. I was kinda bored and uninterested.. Personally I wouldn't buy or watch again
5,Magic Series on British agents in France,"I watched all 24 episodes in four days. It was like viewing a favorite novel. What amazing stories of those who fought for the liberation of France -- through the Resistance, the Maquis and the Free French. Heroes all. They gave their lives to drive the Germans from their soil and to be free once again. Amen to the producers, actors, and the heroic stories told."
4,Nigel 1415,"Very good series. Not on par with BBC'S Secret Army. However, it was entertaining, and the acting is of a high quality. The ridiculous background music is intrusive at times, and it takes awhile to get accustomed to it. Overall, very enjoyable,and I look forward to the release of the other series."
4,Wish me luck,"Like most British films addressing this subject, the plot was good, the acting excellent and the suspense was sufficient to enthral the viewer."
4,Subtitles,"This is a most excellent series, with fine acting and good historical accuracy. My personal frustration comes with Series 1, which does not have subtitling, and my failing hearing cannot quite cope with the British accents in spite of my best efforts. To my amazement Series 2 and 3 do have the subtitles, so I am fully aware of what I missed with the first. If your situation is similiar to mine, skip Series 1 and order or borrow the more recent two. You'll be able to catch on well enough starting in the middle. I do hope this indicates a trend that recognizes those of us who love the content but need a boost to what our ears can catch."
2,What luck?,The promo for the DVD sounded good. I usually like UK stories about WWII esp Foyle's War. This started out to be intriguing then it became boring and totally lost me in trying to understand why these women joined this force. Although some glimmer into their lives offered some clue. The story moved very slowly. Scenes were trite & cliche. Reduntent? I was not able to relate to or connect with the characters in the story. I returned unopened the rest of the series.
2,an unfortunate purchase,"I normally love the British dramas having to do with WWII. Especially loved Foyle's War, and pine for new episodes. (There aren't any more planned.) Wish Me Luck is a real dog. It was made in the 80s and shows its age. Cheesy looking, with inauthentic hairstyles, etc. I watched it for about half an hour, was bored, and turned it off. Will likely end up as a donation to the library."
1,Terrible,Unless you are fond of something that look like a stage presentation you will be disappointed. I would not recommend buying it.
3,A snap shot of the Guard,"Haythornthwaite has a long name, but writes wonderfully concise short books for the Napoleonic fan. ""Imperial Guardsman"" covers the various duties and formations of the Imperial Guard as well as looking at the more statistical information such as numbers, pay, equipment etc. The included color pictures bring to life the author's work which is, as is his custom, not so much entertaining as it is strictly informative. Very little detail is given over to the ""glory"" of the Guard, and much more attention is given to the hard facts about them. The work is short and so one will not get bored reading it. Haythornthwaite has mastered the art of conveying statistical information in this quick but incredibly informative book."
3,"Okay, but could be better","This is a well-intentioned work w/ a good foundation, but one that could've been better written. The author has teaching and mothering experiences, but is not necessarily an expert in this field, which the work reflects. She makes incorrect statements at times. Her assumptions about the readers and others throughout reflect stereotypes this type of work should avoid. Stark is repetitive at times and doesn't flush out a child's developmental capabilities, which would be most helpful. She delves into certain topics, e.g., body image, but completely ignores others at all ages. She is big on affection/touch and children having a sense of control over their lives, as well as how to counter outside messaging, which is a plus. She focuses a lot on the parents' relationship as setting an example. Stark is unfocused at times, however, going on tangents. She gives no resources."
5,HEAVEN IS NOT FAR AWAY,SWEET AND MELODIC JAZZ OF THE MOST HIGH DEGREE.An excellent JERRY BERGONZI REALLY SHINES ALONG WITH THE OTHER JAZZ MASTERS IN THIS COLOSSAL SONIC CELEBRATION .george mraz bass/ mike stern guitar/billy hart drums/andy laverne piano/ A very fluid musical result which lifts you immediately to heaven.ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RECORDINGS OF THE NINETIES WITH SO MUCH QUALITY AND RESPECT FOR LIFE.
2,dissapointed,"Product seems to be of reasonable quality, but sizing seems to be pretty conservative. Great if you are small."
1,It fits the bike but is almost pointless,"The post arrived in good time.Fitted the size correctly, however the suspension is so slight it hardly made any difference to my comfort. I would recommend trying another product, it isnt even a smooth spring, and clicks slightly when i hit a bump and use its full 1 cm ? or so bounce."
4,Get the insight's of the worlds #1 authority on l-arginine,"Dr. Cooke is the world's number one expert on the nutritional supplement l-arginine and its antagonist, asymetric dimethylarginine. It's a mouthful, but among the keys to cardiovascular health. Dr. Cooke speaks with the authority of someone who has performed a huge amount of the ""bench"" research himself. If you're interested in knowing about the most powerful tools available to prevent heart attack and control cardiovascular risk, Dr. Cooke's book is a crucial addition to your library.As a practicing cardiologist who aims to achieve shrinkage of coronary plaque in patients, we've applied Dr. Cooke's concepts with great success.William Davis, MD author of Track Your Plaque"
5,The Cardiovascular Cure by John Cooke et al.,This is an excellent book on the workings of the heart.It explains how a healthy endotheliam releases its own nitro.Small amounts of L-arginine potentiate nitric oxide. This processincreases blood flow and reverses heart disease. The nitricoxide relaxes blood vessels and facilitates blood flow.The endothelium is known to potentiate the increase in bloodflow. This book will help to formulate an optimal strategyto deal with impediments to blood flow and nutritional issueswhich are at the periphery of heart health issues. It would bean excellent addition to the medicinal personal health library.
1,Forget It,"This book is not meant for the normal lay person. I am well read and have read a lot of books on forensics and autopsies. It is something like a med student would appreciate. It was convoluted and boring for me. I got about a third of the way through it and gave it away. A real waste of my $$$. Unless you are in a school for forensics, don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,Not for non medical or field related readers,"I was expecting a book more along the lines of The Body Farm or other ""True Crime"" books. I found this book to be more like a thesis. It is not a recreational read but rather more like a textbook.I should have read the product description closer"
5,Finally!!!!!,"I've seen the tv-special and caught her act at the Flamingo in Vegas in the late 60ies and was mesmerized by hear talent and vitality!For anyone who wants to experience this legendary performer at her absolute peak, do not miss this extraordinary package(strange that it is not mentioned here that it contains 1 DVD and 1 CD!!!)In the same league as Sammy Davis Jr.! (Did they ever perform together???)"
3,The CD is great!,I'm very happy with the quality of the CD. I can't give a review of the DVD because we didn't receive it in our order!
1,where is the DVD?,"this is very disapointing !!!although it says "" Caterina Valente Live 1968 CD & DVDthe box contains only one CD, no DVD anywhere to be found, so it's false advertisement.I bought this item for the DVD, I already have all those songs in mp3 format and I wanted to watch her perfomance, what a huge disappointment!!!As I was not able to contact Amazon, i contacted Eraki records company and they answered that the product which was sold to me by Amazon was a conterfact !!!!It is unbelievable and inacceptable"
3,tv land,The TV special on cd is nicely recorded but it's tv and not a concert. Beware-Pal dvd will not play on our ntsc dvd players!
4,very sturdy blades,"I have a fair amount of property to mow with alot of trees, These blades are a great cheaper alternative to yard sweepers, vaccuums and the like. Using them on a medium hight allows you to mulch the neverending leaves that come every year and mulches them enough to keep you from having to repeatedly empty bags."
4,good experience,"The price was a little cheaper than other places we looked. The ordering was easy, and, the delivery was quick. Overall it was a good experience."
3,Useful reference tool,"These comprehensive translations are of the non-Biblical texts found from the caves at Qumran, and are useful for anyone interested primarily in the *content* of the scrolls. The hebrew texts are not given in this work (those interested in such should search under title = ""Dead Sea Scrolls Study Edition"", published both by Brill/Eerdmans), and the Biblical texts are not given (bibliographies are given for these texts-- most often the Oxford series *Discoveries in the Judaean Desert* is the primary source for Biblical texts).Serious students of Qumran literature will need more than this work, of course, given that some of the renderings given in the book are disputed (debate over the particulars of any given text can be consulted in academic journals and monographs). The book is a solid compilation of translations of the Dead Sea Scrolls."
3,Tedious Information but Helpful,If you want to know the story and the data in the Dead Sea Scrolls this is the book for you. It is not exhaustive since some of the fragments of the scrolls are not even complete words. Yet it does cover the biblical references in the scrolls.
3,Outdated - needs an overhaul,"The information in the book is accurate and reasonably well written, but it no longer reflects the topics stressed in the RHCE exam. The long chapter on rebuilding the kernel and the modules is no longer needed. I wasted way too much time learning this material that is no longer on the test. Also, critical services like POP, IMAP, automount and sendmail do not recieve enough coverage.This book appears to still be the best single source for RHCE review, but be aware that is is not nearly enough to get you through the test. It should be considered one resource among many that you will need."
4,Good for Linux Beginners,"I bought this book to get a premilinary insight into Linux and to move toward the path of certification. This book has served both as a guide to understanding basic Linux administration and as a solid reference. The material is based upon Red Hat 8, so newer Linux concepts such as Logical Volume Management are not covered. Useful for computer technicians learning the basics of Linux at a low cost."
4,"Good book, somewhat simplistic","The book was a very well written book, breaking down the difficult aspects of Linux computing into easy to manage, and distinguisable categories.I also appreciated the fact that this version now covers RedHat v.8.0 - up to date knowledge is hard to come by!However, I would've appreciated more detail in each area. Considering that the RHCE examination tests your knowledge to the max, I would've expected some more in-depth analysis.I would recommend this book to those who are just starting to get to thinking about taking the RHCE exam, not to those who are in advanced stages of preparation."
1,Not worth your time or money,This book is very badly written. It is horrible!! Not enough detail to truly learn the commands and the author has tried to cram in a lot of subject matter into one book but he has missed the needed detail. Very few exercises to cover most important topics. I had to give him 1 star because the system would not let me pick 'no star'. Some engineers just can't write and this author is one of them.
1,Sailor's Bowl,"I bought this bowl less than 3 months ago- last week a small split appeared in the top ring. As the split got longer, three days later another split appeared (about 160 deg. around on the other side.)Very poor quality."
5,need to read,Purchased this because I have found i am yelling more at my kids than talking to them. Thought this would be good for me.
5,"BIT OF A LETDOWN,","I;d say,to enter CARRY ON CAMPING in the Search box and end up with a bunch of ads for Port-a-Potties. Sid's still laughing."
4,"Yea this is a lot of fun, but..............","This party pad is fun, but I am 15 and I more collect the dolls and their fashions, rather than all the playsets. Because I have my 12 my scene dolls displayed so I don't use the my scene playsets. Though I do have one my scene playset, I have the make-up counter set! And I love it.These are the my scene dolls I have:Hanging out chelseamermaid diva chelseashopping spree chelseajammin in jamaica noleeshopping spree noleejammin in jamaica madisonhanging out madisonJammin in jamaica barbiebutterfly punk barbieday & nite barbiedream genie delanceyand one other I forgot which one tho.."
2,keeps falling down!,"My daughter had this for christmas, after nearly an hour removing all the ties, threads, tabs and tape, adding all the stickers and several attempts to get all the columns and stairs attached at the same time my little girl finally got to play with it! It has since fallen down a least 3 times as the columns don't lock in place and it wobbles when you put any of the dolls on the top level. Overall I was very dissapointed by the quality of this toy and will be writing to Mattell to complain."
3,Alright,"I am a Bratz fan, AND a My scene fan. I really do like this house, but they seriously should have made it bigger. It is too small and only one doll can live in this house cause theres one bedroom unless two DOLLS are married. Sooo...$40.00! It's not really worth it..."
1,I wish....,"I wish Bratz would come out with a house cause what kinda house is that?This is so not worth 30 bucks!I rather buy a brat doll with that money!So I think the all the stuff my scene in this house is cheap!Not to be mean,kinda.Brats r better bottom line!"
4,Way beyond fun,"When I looked at the price of the Bratz pad, I was wishing for a house that wouldn't be so much money and that wouldn't be so large. My Scene then came out with this product. I waited for the price to go down, and it did. I bought it, and it hasn't fell down since. Great job, Mattel!"
5,COOL,It is fun.it has real music and a Disco ball that changes colors.I got it a couple days ago and it was better than I thouht!!!It has a colerful bed sheet and it has white fuzz under it!!It also has green and blue beeds on the window!!It has a Fir place too!!!It has a Tv and stickers too put on it(and other things).It has cool stairs too!!It has a cool couch too!!For all Myscene Lovers Get this!!!It also has a giant punch bowl!!!IT IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Got here right in time,"When i ordered this book, i knew I would need to have in my hands to take to my metaphysics class within a week, meaning i was pressed for time. I didnt want to buy it from the school store since it would be super expensive. So I bought it online and it got the day right before I needed to bring it in."
5,Fun fun fun,"I was anxious to read Ms. Billerbeck's new series after having enjoyed Ashley Stockingdale. I was not disappointed. The first Spa Girls book had me wishing I was a fashion designer myself. This was a fun, lighthearted book with a great Christian perspective. Thoroughly enjoyable-a great read for the beach or any day!"
4,True Friendship though all walks of life,"This book, along with the entire series was funny, heartwarming, and just the right amount of drama. I couldn't stop reading it once I started. I like how each character is very different in their own ways, from how they were raised to what they decided to do with their life and no matter what, they had great friends who loved them for who they were."
1,Poorly written and very disappointing,"This was my first trip into Christian chick lit, and I had high hopes for this book. She's All That might just have ruined the whole genre for me. It was written at about a ninth grade level. The main character's obession with her hair as the root of all her problems was annoying and immature. Really? I am to believe this woman with the emotional age of 14 and problem solving skills of about the same graduated from a well regarded university? Her friends are equally ridulous, two demential annoying stereotypes. And who would refer to themselves and their friends as ""Spa Girls""? Often. It is painful for me still to remember all of these details. I am putting this book behind me and hope that Amazon readers will spare themselves the torture."
1,She's All That,"I didnt really care much for this book. It was boring to me and it seemed liked it was drawn out far too long. I absolutely loved her other book titled. ""Split Ends""."
5,Another Billerbeck Winner,"I want to own a Lilly Jacobs gown! Bravo Kristin for writing another great, engaging chick lit! Lilly, Poppy and Morgan are loveable, unique and fun.Billerbeck is a premier chick lit author who's created a unique heroine who would love to hang out with Ashley Stockingdale.Buy this book!"
4,I good book for learning the history of magic.,"If you are looking for a book to learn magic tricks, try something else (like the Mark Wilson Course in Magic.) But if you would like a general book about magic history, especially the careers of the Blackstone Family, this is a good book to get. It covers all aspects of magic starting with ancient China, going through medieval times and heavily emphasizing from 1850 - 1980. Lots of photos and descriptions of a variety of magicians but only gets in depth with the Blackstones. It does have a few basic tricks but they are covered much better in other books.Overall I enjoyed it."
2,Didn't feel very effective to me....,"Having used 'The Firm' tapes regularly for more than a year, I decided to give Pilates a try for a change in workout. I tried this tape for the first time this morning and was for the most part, unsatisfied. The way the instructor chants with the beat of the drums in the backround is thoroughly annoying, and the workout left no part of my body feeling...well...worked. Maybe the focus on the upper body was OK, but I didn't have any trouble with the ab or total body sections. It felt like a very long stretching session which should have lead to some hard work!Maybe that's the point? Am I missing something here? Maybe I'll try some different tapes...I just don't see what's so fantastic about Pilates!"
2,Easy in every way,"In terms of ease to use and follow this tape is fantastic. The instructor is really easy to follow and doesn't go to quickly. Unfortunately, that's also the routines biggest flaw. This routine would be great for when you first wake up in the morning and are too groggy to jump right into a workout but the whole thing felt like a really dragged out warm up. There are definitely not enough exercises or repetitions to do very much good, especially not in the abs section. The upper body section was the most difficult but even that was pretty simple."
1,Not worth your time,"I had very high hopes when I first got this DVD that it would be an easy introduction to yoga and pilates, which I have seen highly recommened. However, the instructions are not very clear, making it easy to fall behind. In addition, most of the exercises require you to take your eyes off the television, leaving you puzzled as to what moves you should be doing and when. Overall, this video is not one I would recommend unless you are already highly conversant in yoga and pilates."
3,a bit dry,"Claire Cross is obviously an intelligent woman. She uses words and phrases appropriate to the content, but that is obviously geared towards the professional or academic reader. I first tried reading this book a year ago when my understanding of the content was naught. Frusturated, I left the book on the shelves until recently, when I revisited it and understood it for what it is worth. Armchair Historians would benefit in passing this book by.Cross does an excellent job of explaining how the common people of England began to change theit spiritual thinking from that of the dictated Catholic Church to the free and open Prodestant Church. She focuses on aspects such as litarcy, the printing press, faith of the monarchs and general public opinion. From Luther to Lollards and beyond, this book does a fair job of explaining the phenomonon that is the Reformation."
5,Good job,"Right item, quick service. I'm happy. The price was good, much lower than other sites withy exactly the same product"
5,The BEST,"These de-icers are the VERY BEST we have ever used. We purchased one of these about 15 years ago, and it just quit working, so we sent for another one. WELL, GUESS WHAT?? The old one hadn't quit, it was just the darn extension cord we had it plugged into. Seems that it was kicking off the breaker. The old one is back in use and now we have a spare, just in case. Here is a hint. To keep your bird bath AND the de-icer clean of mold, add a splash of hydrogen peroxide to your birdbath water. It won't hurt the birds and saves a lot of clean-up. We use it all year long to keep the green gunk out."
2,Calcification issues,"It does keep the water from turning to ice, but it also tends to develop calcium deposits all over it. I tried to buy a decalcifier product and it took some of it off, but then after soaking in the bird bath for another day, the calcium deposits returned. Don't know how healthy this is for the birds, and is not very attractive with white bumps all over it."
4,Farm Innovators Bird Bath Heater,"I have used the Farm Innovator C50 bird bath heaters for several seasons now. They work very well even into the teens in the typical cement bird baths with about 4-5 inch depth. In the REALLY cold weather they only keep a hole open about the size of the heater but that still gives the birds a place to get a drink! They hold up well. The only thing I would like to see is a longer cord (1- 1 1/2 foot?). This would allow the cord to hang over the side of the bird bath a bit more and still leave the heater well submerged. They do work quite well despite this ""shortcoming"" (sorry about the pun). They are very well made."
2,disapointed,"Ijust received the ""birdbather de-Icer and was disapointed to fing it only has abut a 6 -8"" cord. It needs to have an extention cord added to reach outlet. It is too bad Farm Inovators could not have a longer cord. Now I will have to purchase a small extention cord and wrap to keep dry. Look for a De-Icer with longr cord"
1,useless to me,cord to short should come with same length cord as the other models. Cord is not even long enough to attach to extension cord as cord as connection would be under water
5,perfect for my backyard birdbath,I purchased this de-icer to replace the same one I used for over 16 winters in my backyard birdbath. It is so dependable. We live in an area of upstate NY noted for its cold and snowy winters. This de-icer keeps the birdbath water at a perfect temperature all winter long. The low profile fits easily into the bath. The birds just love their little spa on my back deck!
4,Southern Pacific Passenger Trains,"Overall, a good volume for train enthusiasts. Photography is very good, in fact the entire series of these is above average. Book could provide more of a historical perspective, but for its size and relative cost, this is a good value."
3,Natioanl Geographic Globe,"The place where the globe attaches does not seem to fit right, but the globe itself is awesome. Many places in great detail, fine colors and very readable place names make it a great investment for educational purposes."
1,Buy the original instead,"Very disappointed in this album. I bought both this disc and the original Stan Kenton Christmas album ""A Merry Christmas"" at the same time. Kenton's release stands head and shoulders above this pale imitation. Not recommended."
2,It's alright,They don't sound the best! Not that clear when it's all the way turned up. But good deal for temp speakers
4,Definitely not bad,"I got these speakers after my entire stereo system in my 92 Civic Hatchback got ripped off by some thieves. I was happy to get the car back mostly unscathed, but I sure didn't feel like pouring a whole bunch of money in to the new components. The sound out of these 3 ways is really pretty good, especially for the price. It takes a little monkeying around to mount them in the rear, but I managed it with the stock brackets. The new system, which includes these, the 2 way slim mounts and a Boss 637UA head unit sounds pretty nice. It gets plenty loud for normal usage, and cranks up pretty well with no noticeable distortion before it's too loud for me. The bass from the 2 ways is a little weak, but it'll do. I think these were money well spent."
4,Can't be beat for the price,They ended up being much better than I expect. I am planning on buying another set for my Jeep. I have a pair in my boat that sound awesome.
1,They were terrible,"Order got here in the expected amount of time and came in nice packaging. Had them installed by a reputable installer and they worked fine for about three months. Now, I have to press on the speakers for them to work. The wires are grounding out on the speaker wall. I can't afford to buy more now because I am a starving student, thanks guys."
2,LASTED FOR ABOUT 3WEEKS,"IM NOT ONE TO LISTEN TO LOUD MUSIC OR MUSIC WITH ALOT OF BASS IN IT ANYMORE, THEY WHERE CHEAP SO I FIGURED Y NOT BC MY STOCK SPEAKERS WHERE SHOT, AFTER 3 WEEKS ONE SIDE TOOK A CRAP AND NOW HAVE TO HAVE THE BASS IN THE NEG. JUST SO I DONT HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE POPPIN AND CRACKLING NOISE, ILL BE BUYING A WAY BETTER SET WITH A BETTER CROSSOVER SO THIS WONT HAPPEN AGAIN"
2,Boss Audio Systems CH6530 Chaos Series 6.5-Inch 3-Way Speaker,These speakers are cheap. Easy to Install but sounds quality is horrible after a certain point. I wouldn't reccomend these at all. Spend a little more money and get something you'll enjoy rather than put up with.
5,"Good, cheap replacement speakers","Replaced the stock speakers in one of my cars with these cheap replacements.They sound good and are definately worth the price.Come with about 10 ft of speaker wire per speaker with the connectors attached and all the neccesary mounting screws.Also, from the research I've done, each speaker appears to be 150 RMS watts and 300 peak."
4,ight for the price,"decent speakers, nothing special though. definitly more powerful than most stock i would say, though dont seem like they would want to push 150 watts RMS like they rated at.... not alot of bass from them. they do come with speaker wire, but its so thin they would never pull anywhere near 300 watts. but decent sound, over all for the price they are worth it."
5,works awesome recommend to buy LEDGLOW lights,work really good even though this are 300Wreally good soundfits on Honda Accord 2 doors 1999 v tech engine
5,Love the sound,"I am very happy with these speakers. My previous speakers had been blown for quite awhile. I was so happy when I found these speaker through Amazon and once my son installed them, I was and still am loving my music again."
1,DONT BUY!!!,"Well the sound quality on these is are great when you first install, if they both work to begain with. when i receved them i had one working speaker and a broken one. but with in less then a weeks time THEY BLEW UP!!! YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! if you are just looking for something to update your stereo a little they work great but if you looking for something with power and to make some noise look somewhere else!!!"
1,don't be fooled,they look alright but the plastic cover that came with the speaker came broken that sucks I haven't installed them yet.and I'm sure there's gonna be more people who r gonna buy this speakers and the same thing is gonna happen ti everyone that buys this speakers
1,You pay for what you get,"Dont replace your factory speakers with these unless your factory speakers dont work,still cant figure out how they came up with watt rating sound good till you turn volume up a little and would have been nice if they said they came in pairs,so now i have twelve useless speakers."
3,HMM,I just got the speakers today. ANd my bro said they suck! Soo do yall thank they do?? I need ur opinion.
3,perfect for beginners,I bought these speakers before I knew about the technical information about speakers. This is definitely a good system to get for beginners. But later on I most definitely recommend searching for more expensive systems. Other wise good choice.
5,"QUALITY, VALUE",I INSTALLED FOUR OF THE IN A HONDA ACCORD IN LESS THAN AN HOUR. WOW WHAT A GREAT SOUND. QUALITY. JUST FANTASTIC.
4,very good,"the boss audio system ch6530 chaos serie 6.5-inch, be speakers very good and they offer a sound a good fidelity."
4,boss speakers,speakers work great if you dont like alot of trebble get the 2 way speakers they put out very well have stock head unit will be changing that next to one of the boos audio dvd touch screen models good stuff for the money
4,Great Affordable 6.5 Speakers,"I have these 6.5 front speakers in my old civic along with the Boss 6x9 as my rear speakers. They both put out loud and thumping bass with good mids and highs. If you could afford Pioneer or other higher end ones, go for that instead. But if your pocket book is tight and you need just ""something decent"" in your car, than I highly recommend Boss audio speakers! They put out some impressive bass with good mids and highs. Just make sure the 6x9 speakers in the rear are sealed correctly as to using the car's trunk as the enclosure."
4,"""Great Country Album","""This is a great album for any classic country fan. It has great classic songs performed by the singer of ""Rose Garden."" The only two I didn't absolutely love were ""Heartbreak Hotel"" and ""Devil Went Down to Georgia."" Those weren't very great but there are still 22 more great tracks on here. I would recommend it."
5,AWESOME BOOK,This is an awesome book about Britney Spears. Definetely must have for Britney's Fans. There are a lot of good picture with excellent quality inside. I'm glad having this book.
1,CAUTION: THE MOST HORRIBLE BOOK EVEN WRITTEN,"This book is SO trashy! All of the pictures are already seen ones! The information is horrible, for example it says, ""She was in the MMC."" Well, what if people have no idea that it is the Mickey Mouse Club. Britney is not very interesting anyway. She way be hot, but this book is not!"
2,"Girl has nice voice, music is predictable.","Goth/Industrial in a commercial package. If you like to dance, and are in puppy love, then this album is for you. If you want a tapestry in sounds, and visions of horror, and facism, then go elsewhere."
4,Great and accessible,"Got this cd mainly because I wanted to know what was tieing up Trent Reznor and keeping him from releasing his new album. Well I soon leaned that Dave Ogilvie was producing it as well. That being said why would any industrial rock fan pass a listen? Great for new fans of the genre, perhaps this band can revive the genre as well. Great songs here, obvious Trent and Ogre influeneces, Trent even cowrote and played on some tracks (1,4 and 11 im pretty sure) If your a huge indust fan (kmfdm, Nin, SP, PIG etc) recomend this to a friend who is interested in the genre. A great gateway drug."
4,Pretty Life/Pretty Girl/Pretty Pictures,"The cd is great!It Dreams - Jakalopeat first i must admit that it took a while to get used too. i expected everything to be similar to pretty life.. but i was wrong. its a mixture of slow and upbeat songs.the art work on the cd is absolutly amazing!everything is very mystical, you get the feeling your in a mystical forest and your a pixie in some songs.some really good songs areFeel it,Pretty Life,Go Away,Bad-dreamdefinatly a must buy. you will enjoy it.these girls are diffrent."
4,Slightly disappointing....,"Jakalope's first album, ""It Dreams"" isn't a totally bad album. For me it wasn't a very inspiring album, which is how I usually choose my music, but it's good background music and would be great background music for movies. Alot of it is pretty catchy. If Jakalope evolves from this album they could be really awesome, which is why I decided to give it 4 stars instead of 3. The mix is interesting where it sounds like TATU meets [insert industrial band here], so I hope they can evolve in a postive direction. I do long to hear their new songs in the future."
5,My veiw on Jakalope...,"Jakalope is a mix of Industrial, rock and pop. And some of their video's as well as their older website (Now the Petri Dish) have a gothy feel to them. They currently have three videos (Pretty life, Feel It, and Go Away) And preferably should be watched in that order seeing as how their videos follow one big story. You can also get more bits of the story from the Petri Dish section of the jakalope website (jakalope.net). There is also an awesome fan site that keeps track of information, tours, basically anything you could think of, of jakalope. Even the lead singer, Katie B her self posts on their forums. You can check it out at jakalopefan.com.Now, about the music. The thing that I liked about Jakalope is that their music was unique. All of their songs don't get boring. The mix of their dark/creepy tone to their music and the sweet and awesome vocals of Katie B is just so different from most of the bands out their right now."
5,Very reliable SDHC card reader,This is a standard memory card reader for SDHC as well as older SD memory cards. The reader comes with a clear plastic cover to protect the USB jack. I'd highly recommend it.
4,Very good reader.,"It gets the job done fairly fast and does it well. I doesn't crash my system (Mac OS X) like I've read in other reviews, no matter how I insert it. The only ""problem"" or ""flaw"" I see is where the activity light is located - I can't see it blinking when I insert the reader into the right side USB port underneath my iMac's aluminum keyboard. Also it fits a tad loose, something that doesn't happen in the same port with other USB devices, but other than that I am very happy with this product."
2,Think About It,Product is OK. Problem was the design does not lend itself for US Port (s) on neither my desktop (Dell Dell XPS410) or laptop (Gateway 450). My fault - check out your computer before buying an adapter.
1,Died after 10 uses,I bought this to put videos on card for watching on a Nook Color. It died after approximately 10 uses and now will show up when connected to a computer but the inserted disk is not recognized. I need to go out and buy another one if I want to switch out the movies.
2,Sandisk MicroMate to wide,"The case near the USB plug is to wide for use on the front of my computers. This makes it very difficult and inconvenient to use. I have to plug it into the back of the computer, and we all know how easy it is to access that. Also when doing that in interfers with the other USB cables, so I have to unplug one of the other USB cables to allow this to plug into the computer.Nice try, but not very helpful."
5,works greak,i have had no issues and this product is working great it has fast upload speeds and i am very glad i bought it
2,"Ordered Black, got a white one...","I've been using one of these for quite awhile and it works great. Needed a second one and ordered this Black version to keep them separate. But received another white one. Very disappointed to not get the right color, but it works fine."
2,can not get it to work with out another program?,can not get it to work with out another program?can not get it to work with out another program?can not get it to work with out another program?can not get it to work with out another program?can not get it to work with out another program?
5,"Nice Game,Nice delivery",When it came (which it came early) the package was in neatly packed and when i opened it the box was in excellent condition. the game it self is really nice its a really nice addon to the blitzkrieg game. :)
2,30% Sales Pitch,"The techniques used in teaching the steps are OK, but he never goes beyond the really basic step. At least 30% of the video is a sales pitch for more Cal Pozo dance videos. I was disappinted"
3,A buyer from Canada,"This is great video if you have not had any dance instructions. However, the macarena is pretty old now and it takes up about 1/3 of the tape. Don't buy this if you have taken any lessons, it is very basic!"
1,terrible,"This CD is terrible, it's instruction is terrible, there is little of it, I guess since it is a dance DVD maybe most of them are terrible. This DVD is not worth the money spent on it, there is little to no instruction. It looks like a dance instructor trying to make a quick buck."
4,Better Than the Rest,"Tried several latin/salsa videos (as VHS tapes). This was the best of the three I bought for salsa (the other two were horrible). At least the instructions were clear, and they had the footstep diagrams. As a beginner, I could learn from this video. Reasonably satisfied."
2,Not good Salsa,"The salsa steps are out of touch with the real world. You may learn something but it will be while crushing your partner's foot like I did when coming out of the side mambo to the forward back salsa step. Nobody does this. Cal should visit some contemporary dance socials. Princeton, NJ"
3,It Doesn't Leave The Ballroom,"People who want to learn latin dance need to know the difference between social dancing at a club and ballroom dancing. These guys look geriatric if you compare them to the dancing you see at salsa clubs. The least they can do is find better or more sophisticated music instead of that elevator music drivel. The tape is useful, however, and very easy to follow. I think it is a great tape for beginners but if you want to dance they way they do at the salsa club you better find real latin music and a way to spice up those moves."
1,Not that great.,An instructional DVD that does not live up to it's hype. The amount of teaching done is very limited -- and basic -- if you wanted to learn to dance like them latino's do this is defineatly not the DVD for you.I bought this DVD just out of curosity to find how they teach salsa in the states (i am an international style latin competitor from Asia).So may be it is for you if you just want to say that you know salsa -- but if you wanna look good on the floor -- go for something from Josie or Angelo + Malaika.
3,Basic traditional steps,It is a Very basic but very detailed video. This video teaches traditional Salsa as done by hundreds of millions of Hispanic's all over the world. This Salsa step is necessary for those of you who want to dance with Hispanic's or to go on to learn Cumbia or South American Nouveau Flamenco dance. I must point out that Cal is an average dancer at best. His friends or students on this tape are terrible. I laugh ever time I watch them. The music is not great but it is the techniques that make this video worth buying.
1,Waste of money,I bought this video and because I opened it I could not return it. The salsa lessons were too short and looked like ballroom dancing. I did not learn anything useful.
2,Accidental purchase.,"I sorta bought this one by accident. I don't even like Latin music (though I dig Latin ladies), and would not be able to get into the groove of things. I guess for others, this tape would be okay, but for me, nah, not my thing..."
5,Gale's,"Gale's is the best!! Have gotten sooo many study guides from them and they NEVER fail. Sparknotes, Cliffnotes, etc. can't even come close to Gale's. Not putting them down because if Gale's doesn't have one for a particular book or play, then they definitely come through. Gale's is in a class of their own, they set the benchmark."
1,Very disappointing,Agree completely with the 'blurry and fuzzy photos' guy. Could not believe how crappy most of the photos are. I picked it up (shrink wrapped) on sale for 5 bucks (reduced from 50) and i still feel ripped off..Avoid!
2,What is the point of this book?,"The book is suppose to capture the greatest moments of the games in photos but the photos are blurry and fuzzy. Some are so blurry you cannot see what it is. If the intent is to recreate the memorable moments in photos, then I think the book missed its ""goal""."
4,very good insight into genius,"biographies are a bit boring but joyce was not, strange even after you read every day of his life competently reported you can still not understand how he came up with ulysses."
2,"Prime P-Funk, Sub-prime video quality","Although this is the classic period for P-Funk the video quality and camera work are sadly lacking-sometimes the video smearing looks like 3rd generation VHS dubs, the perfomers are often in almost complete darkness,there are no wide shots of the band, generally just closeups of one band member and no audience shots. Hang onto your $$ and hope for better."
1,V.P.,"I did get to see this concert in the 70's. This video was poorly filmed & it left me much to be desired,but it was worth it to hear the music played live again. I guess its because i'm a diehard Pfunk & Jerome(bigfoot)Brailey,fan.[THE DRUMMER]"
3,"good concert, bad video directing","This video seems to have been switched ""live"" as it was happening by a television crew on site. The director (or producer, maybe) should have been fired. During this entire concert video, which seems like a great show, there is a TOTAL of approximately 5 minutes of footage of anyone playing an actual instrument. All the shots are close ups of people singing. Time for an awesome instrumental break? Here, watch some people dancing. It is SO frustrating, the band is on fire, but they aren't show except for the handful of cut-aways, of which each of these basically just tease the viewer, as they last about 3 seconds apiece. Disappointing. SHOW THE BAND"
2,UNA ESTAFA,"No puedo entender como se saca a la venta en dvd/blu ray de solo 60 minutos de concierto cuando esta dura mas de 2 horas, ademas faltan lo mejores temas.Me extraña de MARCO Antonio que haya aceptado esto, pero me imagino que en unos meses van a sacar la ""segunda parte"" para vender dos veces lo que deberian haber vendido una"
3,Los Terricolas !,not really representative of what this band really accomplished. Seems a little to desperate - trying to keep up with the times. mainphrame@yahoo.com
2,"OK Wipers, but replace often","I like the ""winter"" feature of these wipers. They are covered so snow and ice can't get into the bow. However, like most wipers in my experience, they wore out fast and had to be replaced by the end of the season. I continue to look for more durable wipers. Perhaps, it is the nature of the industry that you have to replace wipers twice a year."
5,Excelent product!,"We bought this item for our 8 year old son for Christmas...he aboulutly loves it!! It was very easy to set up, and he played with it for ours on end, after he first received it! He still comes right back to it, and always finds new adventures to create with it! The only negative comment that we would have is that it was very difficult trying to find the actions figures that go with it...had to go to many different stores to complete the set, and still need one more. I think it would be a great idea to include them with the product...eventhough it would make it more pricey, it would be much easier for the consumer! I noticed also that Zizzle has the new actions fiqures out for Pirates 3, so it was even more difficult trying to find the ones for the 2nd movie. Other than that, the toy is fabulous!!"
1,Disney should walk the plank!,"All of the poor reviews of this toy are completely accurate. The ship has parts that constantly fall, pull-apart, or pop-off...all of which make play impossible and frustrating for our grandson. The pieces that are designed to move are not stable when they should be, and they constantly break at the slighest touch. Our ship has orange, foamy trails of Gorilla Glue that failed to hold pieces in place.Look at the Pirates action figures--poor quality and detail too. Obviously, this entire toy line was rushed for Christmas. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It is more of a display MODEL, rather than a toy."
3,Okay but complicated,"I assembled this toy for my son. While it wasn't difficult to assemble, I don't think this toy is very durable or realistic for children's play. It comes apart easily during play which is frustrating for my son and I am sure will be frustrating to other children."
3,Not so good,"The print is okay, not as expected, the quality of plates is not like the corelle quality, i liked the bowls"
3,"Average, but still kept them...","I bought this set of Corelle dinnerware because of past satisfaction with their product. I still like the pattern I chose, but the plates are a bit warped, but I decided to keep them because it's only noticeable when they're stacked on top of each other in the cabinet. The plates are smaller these days, which again, I don't mind because I eat smaller portions now. That goes for the bowls too. However, the coffee cups are too small. They're more like demitasse cups used for espresso. There are two reasons that I won't purchase Corelle dinnerware again. First, the quality is definitely not what it once was and two, they are no longer made in the United States and I am boycotting, whenever possible, the purchasing of goods from China due to my own personal, political beliefs."
2,You better have your own tools!,"I bought this item because I am going to be having back surgery and I thought it would be a great way to still be able to use my laptop after. Well, since it doesn't roll under my bed very far, it will be no use after the surgery! It would be ok if it was about 8"" wider! The instructions were good in that all the parts had stickers with a number on it, so inventory was easy. Putting it together was relatively easy once I took out my own tools. If you don't have your own tools, plan on a long assembly! Overall the product is ok. Will I return it? I don't feel like taking it all apart! Would I buy it again? No."
4,The Saga Continues,This series grows on you; the more we watch the better we like it. Season 2 continues the adventures of Archie and the rest of the McDonald clan set in beautiful scenery filled with interesting characters.This is suitable for all audiences and has some truly entertaining moments. On occasion the British humor takes center stage but it all seems to work together to produce a fun evening's entertainment.I believe most viewers who enjoy BBC type shows will find this series an excellent choice.
5,Monarch of the Glen,"Season two has new challenges, there's more of Scottish life revealed, and more character interplay."
4,charming,"You have to love, love, love the romance of the place and its traditions. And who could resist the lilt & charm of the Scottish speech patterns and expressions. While not a stand alone masterpiece of all aspects of character, story, and film making, definitely a rewarding viewer experience for me."
5,So happy!,"I started watching this on PBS and now they don't show it, so I was so happy to find it and be able to order it on amazon. Thank you"
3,Monarch of the Glen Season 2,"We are enjoying the series, Monarch of the Glen, on instant download but couldn't find Season 2 at Netflix or at Amazon except by buying it. It will hardly do us much good to have only one disk of the series, but we had no choice if we wanted to watch the show in order. Would have preferred not to have had to own it."
2,Enlightening Story about Scotland,"The story of a Scotish family, their trials and tribulations and how each member deals with their lot. Excellent cast headed by Susan Hampshire & Richard Briers and many other wonderful actors. Beautiful scenery, very enlightening if you have a limited knowledge of Scotish folklore. I look forward to the next DVDs of seasons 4, 5 and 6. Recommend it highly if you like to follow a continuing developing story."
4,Sold Me,"I bought this CD a couple of years ago. When I listened to it, I liked it but it wasn't pure enough for my tastes at the time. I kept it but hardly listened to it again.Just last week I was going through my CDs and gave it another listen. Wow! I sure liked it, and I've played it a couple of times since. Hartford is mellow, relaxed, a terrific musician, and his lyrics reverberate in me. What can I say--I'm as old as he is. So I'm using a Christmas gift certificate from work to buy more."
4,"Great Flick, Terrible transfer","I've read some reviews of the other edition of this film and they also say that the quality is poor, so it's probably a problem with the available stock of this film for a transfer. There is no way that this ""remastered"" edition is any better, I couldn't imagine the quality being much worse for a film from 1950. And I've seen my share of noirs from the 40s, so I don't mean in comparison to modern DVDs. But, that being said, I don't regret my purchase because I do love this film that much. It pains me to not give it 5 stars."
1,Poor Quality,I knew this movie before ordering this DVD. I like the story & the actors but the DVD itself is bad. Both the sound & picture are of poor quality. I would not order this particular DVD.
2,Why 1 1/4 Inch?,"I do not know why Flojet thought it was a good idea to make the intake 1 1/4 inches, but that size fittings are very hear to find in my area. I had to order a reducer online so my 2"" well supply would fit in the intake. And THEN the supply outlet is 1"". Duh. Or duh me because I did not check the owners manual on the Flotec website to see what the pipe connections are. Oh, wait. Do they actually tell you the pipe sizes? Are they marked at the inlets/outlets?I also got a Flojet bladder tank to mount the pump on top. But wait. The connections on the pump base do not match any holes on the tank. You can make them fit with the pump feet hanging over the tank base. I am sure the pump will work fine once I get all the irregular, regular fittings to go in the places they need to be. So when I decided to get a supplemental drinking water supply tank I ordered a Shurflo. We will see what their engineers can design."
3,"I passed the exam using this book, but be careful.","I used this book as my main source for studying for the SQL Server Implementation & Design exam. However, it does not cover all the necessary subjects, especially record locking. Also this book is full of errors. Be very careful when using their practice exams, you will flunk the Certification Exam based on their answers. I wondered if they ever hired a proofreader. Also the questions on the back of each chapter are something to be desired.If you use this book, supplement it with the Transcender or Beachfront Quizzer sample tests. If you can get someone to lend you the MS SQL Server Resource Kit, it will make up for what is missing in this book."
2,Not sufficient to pass the exam,A good start to passing the exam but not enough. I missed passing on my first try by one question. Grief. Book is weak on triggers which the exam hit heavily. The practice tests are frustrating and contain errors. You'd be better off using a Microsoft Press Book and Transcender
2,Good example of typos and technical errors,"The last few chapters were written very well. They were thorough, logical and accurate. The rest of the book was poorly written. The beginning chapters were ambiguous, incomplete, inaccurate and contradictory. I would recommend the last few chapters to supplement your MSCE goals. As for the rest.... It's said that a thousand monkeys banging on typewriters for a thousand years could produce the complete works of Shakespeare. I'll give this book four monkeys and only three months."
4,"Good General Overview of SQL Implementation, But More Needed","The book provides a good overview of SQL Implementation, but is not enough. Read the book (skip it's questions and CD), then study the Transcender exams. Assuming you are not a novice, you should pass. I passed on the first attempt using these two resources."
3,"The book is good, but the software is too buggy.","This book does a fairly good job of preparing you for the exam. The book seems to be put together well and the questions at the end of each chapter are thorough. The software was a major disappointment though. The book brags about the amazing testing engine included in the software, but in reality it is virtually useless because there are so many errors in the questions that the engine asks you. I even downloaded a patch for the software from the New Riders web site, but this still did not fix the numerous erroneous questions and answers. Some questions tell you to choose 2 asnwers, but only let you pick one. Others tell you to pick which item does NOT have these traits, but the answers are the items that do have the traits, etc. All of these problems would be easy to fix, but no one has taken the time to do it. Nevertheless, I did pass the test on the first try after reading this book."
2,Not Great...,"I bought this hopping mac would come up with a good server program for there powerful computers. This wasnt the case. I was running this on a dual G4 800 Mhz with 512 MB of ram on a T3, and it seemed very sluggish to anyone who used it. It was easy to set up, but there were not many opptions to customize your server. If you want a much better server try Windows 2000 Server, which is 10x better than this."
5,Great book.,Great book to go with the wooly mammoth toy. Gave to my grandson for Christmas and he has played and played with theim.
4,Big bag.,"This bag is nice, and it is big. It has loads of room and is big enough to carry books, a coffee mug, keys, money, cell phone, papers, and all the other stuff that ends up in your purse. The only reason it is not 5 stars is because the handles are attached, in my opinoin kind of weakly. They haven't given yet, but the bad has only been being used since the beginning of April.*EDIT*Ok, after a year and a few months, the handles are still attached, but they are getting pretty loose. We are going to have to try to sew them on to secure them so my mom can continue to use the bag as she has been. (And she carries TONS of stuff in her bag!So if the bag lasted this long I suppose it is pretty sturdy, but just keep your eyes on the handles. :)"
5,Very satisfied!,After using it for about a month I'm really delighted on how much it will hold and the quality of it.
1,MAXAM PURSE,PURSE WAS VERY SOFT AND ROOMY BUT WITHIN 3 MONTHS ONE STRAP STARTED TO TEAR APART AND THE LINING IN THE MIDDLE SECTION STARTING COMING APART AT THE SEAMS. PROBABLY WILL NOT ORDER ANOTHER PURSE.
5,People love it!,"I purchased this for my wife about six months ago. It has been hung up in our back yard since then, and has taken the Oklahoma winds quite well. The sign is durable and shows no sign of fading, warping, or chipping.Would buy again."
4,Great!,Love these shoes... I originally bought them to replace some sperry's I had for use on my sailboat... but I found I wear these for just about everything.
5,A hand crafted ECCO-like moc,Now that I snapped them up in my size I can recommend these beautifully hand crafted mocs as one of the best designs available. In addition they're ECCO class comfortable. I bought them in chamois and black.
1,Ncircle give up reissuing Sonic DVDs,"This movie is horrible all Ncircle is doing is rereleasing these on DVD. If you want a Sonic DVD buy the shout factory versions stay away from the Ncircle versions they cant even spell the characters names correctly like on the Ro-becca description the spelled Rotor ""Roctor"" No! Not worth it"
4,T Handle Tool,"Very good quality tool, unfortunately I was looking for something more compact, to carry in my traveling tool pack for the motorbike. But this is a welcome addition to my shop tool inventory. I have used it and I am fully satisfied with the product, just can't fit it into my bike tool kit."
5,Surely Did work!!!!!!!,I had read about these and was skeptical!!!!!! I put mine up on a Tuesday evening and by Thursday i had Martins flying around my houses and Gourds~~~~I now have 4 nesting pairs!!! And i trully beleive it was from the Songbird Magnet!!! Would highly recommend!!!!!
3,not a good fit,The bird songs are authentic and have created a lovely chorus in our back yard. The settings were easy to make BUT it was extremely difficult to remove the back in order to make the adjustments to the settings and the volume AND impossible to put the back on again. We have put the Bird-X Songbird Magnet Elecronic Bird Caller outdoors and have had to duct tape the back piece onto the casing to protect the insides of the machine. What an ugly mess.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"Bought one of these from Danny. Didn't last the season. Thought this might solve a lot of problems with CD players and amplification at the same time. I think it lasted 2 months.....then the recording started to sound like it was ggooooiinngg rreeaall ssllooowwww. It was actually kind of funny to hear it. The martins, however, were not impressed. Save your money and go with the CD Recording."
3,Bird X,"Worked great for the first season, but when I stored it for the winter & pulled it out this spring it would not work properly. mounted it in an area where it was protected from the elements despite it being weatherproof. The sound was distorted & would fade. Instead of buying another one I found a CD which allows me to make copies if needed & works fine in my portable CD player.This product was expensive compared to the $10.00 I spent on the CD. I was disappointed."
1,Returned Bird-X Caller,"The Bird-X purple martin bird caller sounded good but only lasted 1 week. After that it stopped working for no apparent reason. I returned it to the supplier and am waiting for my refund. I purchased it because of the automatic daybreak turn on sensor. Great idea, too bad it didn't last."
1,Save Your Money,Save your money. This book is a disappointment. Very poorly written. Black and White (only) illustrations are a serious problem.
4,Good tutorial for beginners,"If you're new to PSP this is a good book that will familiarize you with what PSP 5 can do. Some info is basic. Chapters are divided into 1-hour lessons although I finished most in less than an hour. Nice examples, although some laborious, show you the cool tricks. Examples are author's tricks so it doesn't teach you how to make your own but the examples provide starting point for you to play around and experiment. Best part is the links to more tutorials. Don't expect a complete guide. It only touches the surface. Nice cheat sheet too."
4,psychedelic dinner,"how do they do it? how can a band be so good? this cd was recorded in one take, from what i understand. 75 straight minutes of psychedelic fun! this cd only has 6 tracks, and by the time they wrote it, they had a good number of songs written, and i think they could have replaced a couple songs on here with other songs they only play live; like Cant Beat it With a Stick, or Greusome Gridly would have made this album perfect. i suggest tracking down their live album, it's even better."
5,Top Shelf!,This is a beautifully crafted knife. I bought three as gifts for my groomsmen when I got married and needless to say they were all pleased. As a matter of fact I wanted to keep one for myself!
4,Great knife but...,Beautiful knife - very sturdy. my only complaint - it is very very hard to close. I was afraid I was going to cut myself - I had to bring it in to work to have a co-worker close it for me. Also - the leather sheath is tight and i'm not really sure the knife will ever fit. Overall happy with the quality of the knife and I believe my brother will think so too!
3,Didn't last,Product came as advertise. I bought this as a gift. It was plugged in and worked for 7 days and then it quite. Would be nice if the quality would have been better
5,Works great for bats,This works really well for keeping bats from roosting around our house. They will still come in our yard at night and eat all the buggy's but they no longer make a mess on my windows! I use this with a dusk to daylight timer.
1,mouse buddy,"I have noticed fewer mice in my studio which is located in a field next to wooded area. However yesterday I walked in to the sight of a mouse grooming itself sitting right next to the ""TX-Pro Repeller"". The Repeller was turned on its loudest setting. This makes me think that the reduction in mice might be due to the poisoning and sealing I incorporated at the same time. It may work somewhat, I will continue to keep it plugged in but I am not sure it actually works."
2,Tender ears,"This product is very loud. The medium setting for mice is loud but the high setting for rodents is untolerable. I have had several of the electronic repellers but never have had one this loud. It would probably be perfect for a warehouse that you don't have to occupy for any length of time. Good quality, just too loud. It was delivered quick through Amazon as usual. Amazon has great vendors."
1,Too Loud To Use,"I bought it in Summer and expected to expel away my neighbor's cats. Followed the instruction to set it to the medium level for the cat but the sound sending out was so annoying - ear-piercing sound. Specially in Summer there are more activities outside the backyard and opening windows, I simmply can't take it. I finally returned it and use Moth Ball instead."
1,Just makes a lot of noise,Don't get rid of nothing bugs spider ect don't run from this all it does is make a lot of noise waste of money don't buy
2,WAY TOO LOUD,"I only turned this item on so far, and two of three settings are so loud no one will use them. Someone is clueless who designed it. There is only one quiet setting and I hope the sounds will deter some bats when i am swimming at night. Again, you may seriously want to think about buying this item. Anyone who buys this and tries the two loud settings will say what the #!#!. Two stars may be too high of a rating."
1,This thing is worthless.,"I have trouble with squirrels and small song birds nesting in my yard and in my attic. The Bird-X seemed to be the ideal answer to my problem--- And had it worked as advertised it would have been. I have this large live oak not l5 feet out from my back porch. After placing the Bird-X in a sheltered spot on the porch and turning the volume up full bore I sat back to watch the action. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. As I sit here now, writing this, a pair of squirrels and a couble of mocking birds are just busy as beavers building nests within a few feet of the Pest ""repeller"". I don't know what you can do to get rid of insects but as far as birds and small animals go you'll be much better off investing in a 20 gage shotgun. Don't even THINK about buying this piece of junk. Or, If you think you just gotta have one. Tell you what--- I'll sell you mine for 10 bucks. How's that??"
3,"Best for a shed, not for a house","I just received and fired up 2 of these today. The 3 star rating assumes this thing will operate as advertised but obviously I haven't had it working for long enough to tell. So why 3 stars?In short this unit uses ultrasonic and sonic sound and mixes then depending on whether you have the unit set for quiet, middle, or loud. The louder the setting the more sonic sound is generated which means you can hear this unit operating. At both the middle and loud settings this unit is too noisy to put in any living area, an attic over a living area, or anywhere near a living area.So a word to the wise. If you are putting this in a shed or somewhere where you can turn it off when occupied by people you may be happy with this unit. If you plan on putting this anywhere around a living area and intend to keep it on full time go with another unit. I also would not recommend using this unit on medium or loud around pets, livestock, or near your neighbors (if you like them)."
1,Waste of money,"I bought 2 of these to use over the winter to keep mice out of my pool shed and grill. In the pool shed, the mice made their nest directly behind this product. In the grill, the mice made their nest directly underneath this product. It did seem to keep lions, tigers, and elephants away, but then we never had a problem with lions, tigers, and elephants before we purchased this product.Bird-X TX-PRO Transonic Pro Electronic Pest Repeller"
1,BirdX Bummer - Transonic Pro,"This unit costs much more than others and quits working in months. The reason is, I believe, that paper is used for cones in the speakers. Plastic would not change characteristics and cease to vibrate. Pressure on the speaker cones makes them vibrate again while it is maintained. Attempts to maintain the correct pressure for continued operation are fruitless.Do not pay the high price for this unit. It is not worth it and I suspect the same is true of other Transonic, BirdX branded products."
2,Not well made,"I bought this product a few days back. I plugged it in to drive the squirrels away from my driveway. I left it on on loud for one night and the squirrels were gone! I was a very happy camper.But that lasted only for a day! The next evening I turned it on and it started chirping as usual. Then at bedtime I went back to check on it and lower the volume and found that unit was not working and I could see a red lamp in the back lighted. It seems the unit is dead after one night use.So I have mixed review of this product. If it is operating normally, it works but the electronics quality is not reliable so there is no guarantee how long it will last. And at $35, I can't afford to replace it every week! I have a 90 day warranty from HFT so I may exchange it before 90 days, but I may return it too."
1,Very Loud,I am not happy with this product. To get it to repel big animals the noise is so loud that it makes you deaf. It has attracted all types of bugs and especially roaches into my house. Something I do not understand. Very unhappy with it. Too bad I wasted my money. Do not recommend this at all.
1,Died in less than 12 hours,"I bought this device to help chase squirrels out of the attic in my garage. I received it on the evening of February 6th, set it up and it appeared to be working well. A loud audible noise was being broadcast by the pest repeller. I shut the garage door and could still slightly hear the unit in operation. This morning my wife called me at work to see if I had turned the device off as there was no noise coming from the garage. I told her I would check out the unit when I returned home in the late afternoon. I went to the garage and found the repeller with the red power light on - but no audible sound coming from it. I tried changing the settings to see if I could coax the unit back to life, but it was DOA.For now I have rated the repeller one star. I have requested a replacement and will update this review accordingly."
1,peice of junk,i bought this to get rid of rodents in my garage. the unit is loud. it did get rid of the rodents. but it is also annoying to humans.well working in the garage i have to unplug the unit. I WOULD NOT RECOMMED BUYING IT.
1,Very loud,"It was extremely Loud and didn't work, except on me. I wanted to leave the area every time I turned it on"
2,Attracts rather than repel,"i tried this unit in my Gym/Office. Plugged it in, set the levels, and left it on for two weeks. What i came to discover was it definately was not working as advertised in that several mice had taken up residence in a shoe box not more than 6 feet from this unit. it is a good people repellant though, the noise is obnoxious."
3,SOSO,"This item has several options to defense different kinds of insect. However, it doesn't has a option to defense all kinds of insect."
1,Disappointed,"I purchase the Pest Repeller to chase off a squirrel that was living between a ceiling and floor. It left for a day or two of me putting the repeller upstairs but it has since returned and seems un-affected by the repeller. I have moved it to different locations and the squirrel just moves to a differnt area further away.I may just have a stubbron squirrel, but am disappointed since I've had to call for professional assistance."
3,It does work,"I can't use this except on the ultrasonic feature, because it is so loud. I bought it for the basement to keep larger pests out, such as pocket gophers, but I could hear that setting, even through the floor boards.It does work, though. No more pocket gophers under the house. And an extra plus of no more spiders down there either. I just bought another for the garage."
1,not so much!,"the product itself isnt what its cracked up to be! The med & high settings are so loud they are sure to repell humans as well as rodents! To boot, it broke exactly 28 days after opening the box. : ("
1,Did'nt Work,"I purchased the unit,Bird-x tx-pro, to keep squirrles out of my atic. Completely ineffective, use moth balls, tempory but effective."
4,We Didn't See Pests after Purchasing,"After we plugged this product in and began using it, we did not see any more rats in our house. Not being an expert, I cannot 100% contribute the pest absence to this product. Our house was 1400sqft and built in 1953. We experienced a sudden rat invasion leading to the purchase of this product. We placed it in the attic, and the sound was barely detectable in our normally bustling household. We did have the rats return in the two years following. Even though we have recently sold that house, I think this product is definitely worth a try if you are experiencing a pest issue."
1,Bad Decision,Purchased two repellers 2 weeks ago and nothing changed!! To me it seems there are now more bugs. They were driven out of the walls instead of into them!! This product is not worth the money. DO NOT BUY!! I will be returning them as ASAP!!
1,It comes from cows. It's not milk.,"As if U.S. schools were not saturated with enough child-damaging fads (whole language, constructivism, discovery learning, developmentally appropriate practices), the Caines come along (yet again) and try to provide a ""scientific"" foundation for faddish twaddle by deriving instructional practices from brain research that is considered questionable by brain researchers themselves. Little more than new age nonsense gussied up with gauzy rhetoric that sounds like science--but isn't."
5,After 15 years I am still wearing this perfume,"OK...so you think 15 years is a little much? Not true...everytime I wear this perfume someone will always ask ""what perfume are you wearing"" 15 years later and I will not give it up."
1,Doulton By Royal Doulton For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Ounces,"The picture is look REAL but the product when I recevied is FAKE. The bottle is not look the same with the piture, also the cap make by fiber plastic, look Ugly inside. The seller advertise is New, but when I recevied is Open box, Not have original wrap ....terible seller....never do bussiness with YOU again....Doulton By Royal Doulton For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Ounce...Fake ....Fake.Sent me another one is real."
5,nice tie,"It's a nicely made computer keyboard tie. Good quality. Hey what's not to like. It's kind of a novelty tie, but fun to wear on specific occasions."
3,Homage to Mary Stewart?,"I generally like Barbara Michaels, but this wasn't her best. The plot was thin, and the paranormal bit felt like filler. What struck me the most, though, was that I felt like I'd read it all before (and better), in one of Mary Stewart's romantic thrillers. It you liked this, try My Brother Michael, The Moonspinners, or Madam, Will You Talk?"
2,Turns out I don't like Gothic novels,"I got this book because I am going on a Greek Island cruise. I give it marks for the history and mythology. Otherwise I was bored. I didn't really like any of the characters. There are 4 older adults and 2 young adults that are on this island. The 4 older folks had been there representing various perspectives during WWII. There was not enough foreshadowing to spark my interest as to why they all happened to be back together. The young woman kept having dreams and/or memories of a past life; take your pick. That sounds like it should be interesting, but it wasn't. Who-ever edited the Kindle addition was asleep at the switch, probably out of boredom. There are errors on nearly every page."
1,The Sea King's Daughter,The story line could have been good but it moved too slowly throughout the entire book. None of the characters were very memorable and I wouldn't bother reading a continuation story of any of them. Michaels tried to put a twist in the end but it was much to late and not very successful.
2,Bad editing,"Not one of Barbara Michaels' best, but acceptable if it had not been completely ruined by the bad editing. For the price more sentences should have been completed!"
5,Very easy to use...,"If you're looking for a book that covers everything, then this is the book for you. Easy to use and lots of fun activities."
4,Wonderful quick resource for a remarkable place,"A great introduction to some of the many colorful historic events of the Outer Banks. Molly Perkins Harrison successfully paints a vibrant canvas with tales of colonists, aviators, shipwrecks, pirates, the Civil War, lighthouses, environmental challenges and epic struggles with nature. A quick and lively read that will have you wanting to know more about this unique 200 mile bit of sand along the eastern coast of North Carolina."
3,Danish side needs work,"I agree completely with the previous reviewer. Routledge has published in a relatively inexpensive format a dictionary originally published in Denmark. The only addition is a VERY inadequate section on Danish pronunciation and noun and verb inflection. The dictionary should have pronunciations for all the Danish headwords and grammatical information on plurals, irregular verbs, etc., at the headwords. This has the potential to be a great dictionary for English-speaking learners of Danish. As it is, assuming it's aimed at the English-speaking market, why did Routledge even bother? Very disappointing. Danish deserves better."
2,...but the very worst thing about it is...,"Thinking about this dictionary again after several years, the most basic objection to it suddenly occurs to me: you can't lay it open on a desk! It is a huge book (with huge type, and yawning white spaces) so it's useless as a portable dictionary. But say you want to sit down and do translation with it: the cheap and stiff binding forces you have to hold the book open with both hands...and then let it flop closed while you turn back to the book you were reading or the paper you were writing...then turn away from that and prize open the dictionary again... *OR* you can cut this Gordian knot by breaking the spine in as many places as possible and, in the time between this and when all the pages fall out, special order the Gyldendal or Hippocrene dictionaries. That's the most gratifying option."
5,This one's a Keeper!,"I think it's funny that one reviewer was upset that this was not the POP album he expected... THANK GOD! This album sounds more like the Motels first album than any of her later works. It's raw, edgy, haunting and explosive', all rolled into one disk. After more than 15 years since her last new songs were recorded this is a work of art. And heck... there are 2 more albums in the bullpen likely to be released soon.Take advantage and get this disk and listen to it a few times. I don't know where Martha gets the inspiration to pen such rockers as ""True Love"" and ""Torture Me"", or more haunting visions such as ""Angel"" or the wonderful ""Crazy"", but I hope it never stops. This one is a big KEEPER!RS"
5,Out of time...,"I had not read the Joan Lindsay book ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"", only watched the original theatrical release of the movie. Dream within a Dream is the compelling story of what happened to the girls after they vanished in 1900. This book is set in several time periods and I kept imagining a middle aged Anne-Louise Lambert playing Clare Hammond. Although not essential, If you have never seen it I recommend watching the movie first, for no other reason than it's a classic Australian Movie directed by Peter Weir. Dream within a Dream is a great read and completes the tale."
4,"The Reunion, A reunion with beloved characters and new ones","I waited a long time for this book, # 5 in the series ""The Marketplace"" and, I'm happy to report that it was well worth the wait. The characters are realistic,their problems,struggles and successes are familiar. They are, for the most part,warm, caring and genuine. The new characters are many, wonderfully diverse and endearing...except for the ""villian"", of course. Best of all, two of my favorite characters finally get to have really hot sex together. There is other good sex in the book as well, but this is not just a book with sexual content,it is much more."
5,never dissapointed,Outstanding .... Laura's development of Chris Parker always leaves me pining for more... I have really looked forward to reading this book and am far from dissapointed ...not only did I get to come back into the world of my favorite slaves but now I have new characters to follow. If you are tired of the fantasy world fetish and would like some realism with your fiction ...I couldn't recommend a better series... hope you enjoy :)
5,She's a master,"Laura Antoniou writes the most deeply gratifying erotica I have ever read. It is like nothing else that has ever been written. Her books have made me weep with gratitude. If she ever stopped writing, ten thousand lights would go out."
5,She appreciates alll of our people,"""She appreciates alll of our people"" -- Ani DefrancoI think that is a good quote to describe this series of books, andespecially the last one. The author apprceciates all of our people. (:The Reuninon is a reunion with the reader's self. The Reunion is ahealing, sexual, explorative piece of work not soon forgotten, nor soonsated. It's addictive and more: it's something that makes you look atyour life.Cindy"
2,The Ancient Mediterranean,"I do not recommend this book unless you are more interested in a technical history rather than a layman's history. It may make a good textbook, but it is not exciting to read."
5,"A Satirical Take on War, History, and Culture","I was entranced by this film. Artfully taking the events of Little Big Horn and translating them into '70's (then contemporary) Paris, ""Don't Touch the White Woman"" manages to at once entertain, delight, and provoke. The final scene remains one of the most scatching indictments of Imperialism yet to be recorded on film. To cap it all of, Marcello Mastroianni dazzles alongside Catherine Deneuve."
5,Beautiful Bedskirt for the Price,"The colors work with my room design. I spent a lot of time looking for the right bedskirt. It does need to be ironed when it comes out of the package. And since it's polyester fabric, be sure to use a cool setting. I didn't and made an iron imprint (in a place that won't show.)If you like the picture then you'll also like it in person."
3,Different Gleason,"Jackie Gleason tried all sort of arrangements for his music: lush strings, big band brass, mandolins (Lonesome Echo), or, in this case flute. The presence of tens of flutes instead of the usual strings creates a wonderful sound, both familiar and yet original. Another great, different Gleason album."
1,Be Aware Does Not Work with Itunes,"Nowhere in the product description (or in the manual) does it mention that there are limited sites to download from.. in fact, there are no sites listed at all. The manual says to drag music from a music download site to the mp3player. Although this was easy to do, the player will not recognize any of the songs I downloaded. COBY customer service was unhelpful. Call and find out exactly which sites you can download from, or don't waste your money."
2,"Missing Parts, Overpriced, but sink itself is nice","Package was missing the sink clips, which FRANKE USA sent to me free of charge, not that that exactly helped when the contractor was here and couldn't finish the sink plumping without the sink in place properly. The sink itself is really nice and has a ""warm"" texture, if that makes any sense. However, this is WAY overpriced at Amazon, and I regret buying it here. I drew attention to their overprice and they reduced it, and I, like an idiot, bought it. It was $60 cheaper at Menards. If you like this sink, compare price to Menards. The FRANKE and Kindred are just different names - exact same product. Hey Amazon, if you're reading this, I'll gladly accept my $60.00 credit whenever you wish!"
4,"Classic, but not ""Vintage""...","This is an essential buy and the performances great, HOWEVER PBS is broadcasting ""Vintage Sinatra"" in August/Sept. '04 which contains the footage from the travelling show (similar to the Elvis show) from the past year. The restored clips are being used for the Capitol ""Concept Albums"" infomercial as well... Most, if not all the footage is expected to be shown, and a DVD is rumored to follow shortly after. Considering the Capitol era is most people's favorites, this should be a welcome addition to the video collection."
3,Blackmail Review,"This is very early Hitchcock. It's a pretty good film but not one of his best. One thing I found interesting is that there's no speaking during the first several minutes of the film. It starts out as if it's going to be a silent film. The plot is good, acting is fine. The visual quality of the copy that I received was sub-par. I realize this is an old film and one can't expect the clarity of a modern film, but I was hoping for it to be at least slightly better than it is. But perhaps I got a dud and maybe there are better looking copies available out there. But overall I liked the story, actors and the film in general."
2,TINY PRINT,I just got my Bible and the print is so small I can barely read it. I searched multiple web sites for a RSV study bible with large print and was unable to find one. I will have to use a magnifyer to read it without straining my eyes. I wish publishers would be more user friendly.
5,Perfect,"This was exactly what I was looking for. The size is perfect along with the zipper. The other reviewers are correct in saying how small the type is, but with a good reading lamp there is no problem."
4,Good for Travel or if you have children,"+JMJ+This Bible is a great translation! I would caution though, that the print is rather small, and the footnotes are hard to read sometimes. The other feature I don't personally like is that the explanations for each book are altogether at the end of the Old Testament and at the end of the New Testament. But, this is a great Bible for devotional or prayerful reading! But I would not recommend it as a study Bible. If you have children, it is good that it is zipped so that little fingers stay out of it!"
5,large-print Ignatius bible review,"I am so glad that I purchased this bible. It is a beautiful translation, and is very easy to read. The print is perfect size for those who have problems reading the typical size print found in most bibles."
4,"Great little Bible, small type","This is a great little Bible that easily fits into my larger size purse. It does have the thin, fairly transparent pages so you do need to be careful when handling the pages. The type is pretty small. I love the Bible cover and having the zipper closure that goes completely around 3 sides of the Bible really helps protect the pages. I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 only because the type is so small that I did eventually buy another Bible that was easier to read (overall bigger and bigger font) and had space in the margins where I could write notes. I still carry this one when I travel, as it is a very convenient size and does travel well."
5,I should have bought it on Amazon!,"I thought that I checked Amazon.com a few months back and maybe it wasn't on sale then when I bought my Catholic Edition RSV thinline edition. But aside from my impatience, I love this book. I carry it daily and read it a couple of times a week. Along with it I carry a 1928 BCP, A small Benedictime Rule and an Orthodox prayer book that was given to me by a friend. I am so happy that everything I just mentioned fits snugly in a small bible case. I read my prayer book daily and the readings from the RSV CE as I have time. It takes up very little space in my pack and I can take it anywhere. I do agree that the print is a bit small but that's what daylight & booklights are for. My only regret is that I paid too much somewhere else."
5,"Looks nice, feels nice, great for you or as a gift.","What else to say... You can check the translation on google. RSV is one of the bests IMO. I bought is as a gift for my brother. It came with a nice box and the Bible itself looks really nice. The paper is super thin, but the font, size, everything is perfect. I recommend it. Ohhh... and the zipper is good too."
4,Good but...,"Just wish it had a bookmark ribbon thing. That would have made this a diamond jewel. Although the font is small, it doesn't bother me. I love the zipper. Like I said, wish it had a ribbon."
4,Nice Bible,"I like the leather cover and the zipper case. I gave it as a gift and he loves it, but says that the print in the Old Testament is way too small."
5,"Oil, Smoke & Mirrors review","Absolutely fascinating documentary. Puts a whole new face on the 9/11 tragedy: what and who really caused it? Is the American public being told the truth?And why is ""peak oil"" not talked about by politicians and what was it's effect on 9/11? Every American should watch this documentary and decide for him or herself."
2,Just Not As Cute As I Thought They'd Be,"They're high quality, but some of the kittens are just downright ugly. I think there were only 3 that were actually cute."
3,Red Badge of Courage,"Terrified Terrier is a twist on the classic The Red Badge of Courage. It also has a story following Wishbone and his humans. Although it is one of my least favorites, it teaches a very good message of staying true to your real friends, and it introduces younger kids to yet another classic book. Kids will love Wishbone and his hilarious show!"
1,I never got my item or heard from the person who sent it,I never received this item. I e-mailed the person I bought it from and never heard from them.
5,"The Prophecies of Daniel in the Light of Past, Present, and","If you are interested in endtime prophecies, this is the book for you. I have never understood the book of Daniel before, nor the Revelations. Talbot's insights are phenomenal. Bought one for myself and my mother. Excellent, easy reading. A must have for Bible scholars."
2,I WISH I HADN'T BOUGHT THESE SIGHT UNSEEN,"I usually love corellware so ordered these sight unseen. The pattern is raised so when you scrape your fork across the plate, it's very annoying, like fingernails scratching a blackboard. I don't like it and my husband doesn't like it. They also aren't very shiny, kinda dull for brand new, although that's not enough to make me not like them but I really hate the scratching. As soon as I can afford it, I will get rid of these and find something else but won't buy on line."
1,DO NOT BUY BREAKABLE ITEMS FROM AMAZON,"In the last year of ordering correlle abundance items as gifts for my mother in law from Amazon, they have managed to pack absolutely nothing securely. The latest blunder being the packaging of a ceramic baking set, which they dropped in to a cardboard box and applied one thin sheet of styrafoam packing. Getting this item replaced has been a 3 month nightmare, ending with Amazon telling me sorry for the trouble we can't meet our obligation to you, here's your money back. 100% unacceptable from a retailer who use to carry such high standards in customer service."
4,Great Set of Dinnerware,"I bought this set of dinnerware because I had several pieces of this pattern already (I have a ""fruit"" theme in my kitchen). The dishes are beautiful and I have no complaints. This is my third set of Corelle that I use for my everyday meals. Corelle is so durable with kids and grandkids around. I would have given this set 5 stars, but my set came with the 4 piece set of drinking glasses and the colors on the drinking glasses were quite faded and not at all like the color bands and fruit on the actual dishes. I bought 3 sets of 4 (service for 12) and 2 sets out of 3 had the faded looking glassware. One set was fine. It really was too much of a hassle to return the drinking glasses (and glasses don't last as long as dishes anyway). It doesn't appear as though the current set of dinnerware being offered comes with drinking glasses so perhaps this is a mute point."
1,They already broke,"I brought these dishes thinking it was not going to break. Yea, right two of them are already broken. So much money for nothing. I could have brought regular ones, and let the kids break , but I would had more dishes."
3,"Defective pattern, Amazon customer service superb","Ordered 4 sets, about 60% of all the large plates had what looked like blue paint streaks across them that were very noticeable. Also agree with other reviewer that when utensils hit the design it is like fingernails on a blackboard. Ended up getting enhancement pattern and absolutely love them, simple yet elegant. Amazon was outstanding (as usual) as far as their customer service in returning the defective plates. My favorite place to shop."
2,Not a dinner set,"The saucers, cups, bowls and luncheon plates were fine. The dinner plates were a mess, a different design on one plate and ink smudges on the other 3. I ordered these as a replacement and now have a good set for 8 of luncheon plates, but not dinner plates."
5,Great,"Not only pretty, but very durable and don't have to worry about chipping.Use them every day and they are easy to clean and stack in cupboard."
5,Love these earrings!,The size of these stones are just perfect! I have triple holes in my ears and these are placed in the second holes. They shine so brightly and catch attention. Worth every penney!
1,Poorly written book.,The main drawback of this book is that the poor chapters about different types of homicide are not followed by any further literature.
3,Review,"While this toy is sturdy and made well, it was less active and more for the 6 months size. I was looking for something with a little higher technology, sounds, lights.... but it will do for babies that are 6 months to 1 year."
2,you get what you pay for,"I got it cause it i was in my price range and it came VERY fast in Two days.Put it up for her in like two min. But Not that crazy for it now that I got it. Ever time I try to get her to stand with it .it is not much of a support of helping her stand,she goes to the let or right."
3,new generation- different dangers,I bought this toy for my one year old nephew as my five kids all learned to walk pushing this toy in front of them. She returned it because her pediatrician told her it was dangerous. I find that hard to believe unless the child is unsupervised near downgoing stairs BUT i feel compelled to throw the thought out there...maybe it is dangerous.
2,Brand new !,Yesterday the item was delivered to me. It has scratches on its surface. When you inspect the toy you can see its product date is 2006. So although it is brand new it looks like it is used. So I don`t like it at all.
4,Love it!,I got this for my granddaughter and she just loves it. Great for small motor control activity and will be great when she starts pulling herself up to walk. I got it for an unusually great price!!
5,great toy and great price,"7 months and my son was all over this toy, pulling him self up and then walking behind it until something gets in his way"
4,Learning to walk!,Our granddaughter is walking now at 11 months. I think this walker helped. She would walk with it at 10 months and seemed to really enjoy the effort. The front is simple and yet she did enjoy playing with it.
2,"Good idea, but cheap","This baby walker is cute, but handle falls when baby stands up to use it. Not very interactive either. Baby is able to move it easily though."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!,"Ok! so we all love fisher price and I was excited to get a walker for my son - I bought it for him when he was 10 months old and we have had it for one month now. It looks great in the picture BUT its EXTREMELY light weight... DO NOT BUY THIS!!! its not meant to work as a walker... when the kid tries to stand up the toys falls over, the kid falls over, and he or she gets hurt. again - its very light weight and cheap... you are better off getting something heavy and durable... my son tries to stand up with this toy to practice and he falls over... the toy cant hold the childs weight... and my son is not over weight or fat... just a normal 11 month old baby!"
1,Not Sturdy,"This toy is NOT sturdy at all. If my child puts any weight on it while pulling up it flips. He has been pulling up and cruising around, even standing unaided a bit for a while. When he uses this it either tips and smacks into him... or starts rolling ahead of him to fast. If I wasn't always right there when we have it out he would probably fall on his face. The activities aren't that fabulous either. When he was a young baby I had it flat so he could play with it. He liked flipping the little flaps back and forth for a few minutes a few different occasions and that was about it. Overall, a waste of money. If I was going to buy an unsturdy activity walker again I would get the vtech one, at least the activities are entertaining."
1,Dangerous.......do not buy!,This toy is dangerous for babies! My grandson was pushing it and the handle fell off. He would have fallen had I not been following along with him! Fisher-Price used to mean quality! I would NOT recommend this at all! Shame on you Fisher-Price!
4,Excellent,I purchased this for my grandson. He has had a blast with it. It has helped with his walking. It folds down for easy storage and travel.
5,Now my son walks on his own!,"This walker did wonders! I bought this for my 10 month old son because I noticed he was starting to attempt to walk and I thought this could help. It did! After just a few days of using this walker my son can walk all by himself! He's all over the house now. He doesn't really need this anymore, but he likes to push it around, or play with the toys on it. I would definitely recommend this. It's cheap, and gets the job done. Whether it be for entertainment, or helping your child to walk on their own."
5,great design!,We got this as a hand me down when my son was 8 months old. He really got into it at 9 months. Now at 11 months it is his favorite toy and has taught him how to walk. He loves walking up and down the sidewalk and all over the house with his walker! A great toy indeed!
4,It Fun But It's cheaply made......,"I bought this for my son and he is turning 8 months old. the toys on the front really get his attention and I loke the way this walker doubles as an activity toy and a walker. You have to be with your child while they use this because it will just keep rolling, no way to brake the toy. The walker looks much more sturdy and well made on the box. When you take it out you are expecting to get hard plastic or such, but the handle and the wheels are very cheap. For the price that I payed for this item on sale and with a coupon it is a great toy that will do the job just fine!"
4,Great toy to aid walking,Got this for my baby and it immediately helped her in her walking. Very sturdy to helped her lean how to walk. It's a little cheap looking and the toys on it are just okay but the baby likes and the price was ok.
4,Awesome Toy,"my 11 month old daughter seems to love this toy... seems very cheap, but is very strong after a few nose over tumbles.."
5,muy bueno excelente lo recomiendo,"es excelente lo recomiendo, es grande, brillante, y a los niños le gusta, mi hijo le dio rosca y rosca, es muy resistente"
3,"Pretty good product, but be careful.","We got this for our daughter when she was almost 11 mos old. She really enjoys it and I think it's helped her walking practice tremendously. However, it once tipped back and she somehow managed to fall over with it and the walker was underneath her and upside down. She didn't get hurt, but she was frightened."
1,"Not a lot of work put into this, cheaply made walker!!!","I would highly advise against this walker, it is so flimsy and poorly constructed, I tossed the ones given to me away right after both of my twins fell over trying to use them. I know the price sounds great, but believe me pay the extra money for your peace of mind. After all, this is for babies, you would think they would use durable, quality plastic."
1,for small babies trying to walk,"I think we bought this too late, our daughter has had no interest in playing with this, would like to return it but do not have original packaging..."
5,Very manuverable,"My daughter started using this around 7 months very efficiently. She learned quickly to turn it in full circles and would put her stuffed animals in the oval handle and push them around the house. It is light enough for my petite little girl to run with and the balance is spot on. She had another one given to her but it was back-heavy and she couldn't lean on it and fell a lot. She is 15 months now and doesn't need it, but she still like to grab it once in a while and run into peoples legs for a good reaction."
1,DANGER!!!,This is a horrible product! it is to light weight which causes it to flip over far to easily. within the first ten minets of my daughter playing with it she flipped over rather hard. We made sure every thing on it was ok and locked in place and then she fell over a second time. We even tried weighing it down but again she fell. I'm glad we have carpet if I had let her use it over a hard wood floor her head could have cracked open!!! please spend the extra money to get a safer walker. Don't let your baby get hurt. If money is the issue go on [...] or something.
5,Fun fun fun,This a great toy. I purchased it for my now 7 month old. He was automatically drawn to it. The bright colors are attractive. This toy is fun fun fun!!
2,Not great.,"I bought this walker for my 11 month old son. He walks holding onto furniture all the time. But, he showed no interest in the walker. When he pushes it, the wheels move too fast and he falls. The toys on the front didn't hold his attention either. He played with it once and then didn't touch it again for a month. I ended up returning it and purchasing a different one. He plays with the front of the new one all the time, although the wheels still have the same problem."
2,Not much fun,My nephew likes it but it gets boring quickly... the activities it has are not really to exciting so he gets bored quickly.
5,Walker,Love that it grows with her as she starts to walk. She loved playing with it. Would definitely recommend this toy
4,Walker help,I purchased this to help my nephew learn to walk better and he loves it. I like the fact that it can be used as just a toy once he is comfortable walking.
2,Light Weight,"I was excited when my son received this as a gift for Christmas. He is 9 months old and cruising furniture. He loves this walker, however, I am not impressed. It is so light weight that when he just pushes it a little, he can flip it over. I always supervise my son when he is ""walking"", however, this toy does not seem safe at all. When it is in the locked position, he can also flip it over."
2,disappointing,"This is way too unstable for a prewalker. Every time he'd try to stand up, it would tip over."
4,Great push toy with some activity stuff for kids,"My daughter loves to push toys. When I saw this and the price, I had to get it. Most cost over $40.00 and this one had a few things she could play with and enjoy pushing it around. Very easy to put together, simply have to put the stickers on and push it up."
4,Excellent,"The initially sceptical Greek-American sociology Professor, Kyriakos Markides, documents the daily life of a miracle healer. He focuses on the interesting events and conversations, so the book is far from being a boring diary.In addition to miracle healing, there are accounts of out of body experiences (""exomatosis""), exorcism, extra-sensory perception, memories of past lives, and turning a plant into copper (and sending the plant to a chemistry Professor, and getting an interesting reaction out of him). Markides witnesses only a little of it though, most of it being recounted by Daskalos (the healer) after the fact, but even that little is eye-opening stuff. Unlike Rudolf Steiner, Daskalos never says anything dumb or hopelessly unbelievable, which enhances the reader's interest in everything he says."
4,Very well written and interesting,"This book deals with a lot of spiritual ideas that may be too far out there for most people. That being said, if you are interested in a spirituality that accepts reincarnation, spiritual healing, and Gnostic viewpoints, I think you will find this book very interesting.It is the story of a Greek spiritual healer, told by an American Professor of Greek heritage who encounters the healer on a trip back home.The book is engaging and well written, and presents the material in a thoughtful and gentle manner.Well worth reading."
5,It is not Greek! It is amazing!!!,"This is about Gods work through this amazing healer in a such a remote island, Kyriakides nailed this one !!!!!!great book!!an eye opener to spiritual seekers!!!!!"
3,"Collision between Traditional Christianity and ""New Age""","As someone with an academic background in theology (Ph.D.), I was uncomfortable with this book. Christianity has had many wise women and men throughout the ages, and the protagonist,""Daskalos"", is wise. However, when he began his discourses on the metaphysics of ""psychonoetic planes"" and ""elementals"" etc., it began to take on the character of pseudo-science. ""Daskalos"" is a fascinating person of our times, but if a reader is seeking Christian wisdom untainted by the vagaries of New Age ""spirituality"", she or he would be better served by reading the Desert Fathers, the Life of St. Anthony (by Athanasius), or any number of classic spiritual texts."
4,Confirms and Provokes...,"Have you ever looked into the topic of energetic healing? Have you ever looked at biographies and autobiographies of healers? I have. I've read lots of them. And the ""Magus of Strovolos"", which is about ""Stylianos Atteshlis"", a Greek Cypriot healer who lived until the early 1990's, did what no single book has done that I've read so far. It tied everything together and proposed a truly complete view of things, from reincarnation and Karma, to healing, astral projection, to philosophy, to ethics necessary to move into the work. And, it was absolutely hilarious at times...But before you decide that ""funny"" isn't a good thing in a book that covers this topic, let me tell you that it's not funny through and through. It's deadly serious at times. And the subject matter is so thought- provoking that I've found myself reading this book (and the subsequent two that are now out of print), several times, just to be sure that I didn't miss anything.It's THAT good..."
5,Just what it says it is,"This is a basic earthbag building guide, which is exactly what the title says. This is for the folks that learn visually as opposed to what they can read online. It puts all of the information scattered across the internet and explains the simple concept in visual depth. Dr. Owen Geiger is a great instructor and I would consider him a philanthropist for all he does on the natural building blog. A wealth of information is shared there.Basics are something that many people can understand when read, but until they SEE it in action, are scared to take the first step. This video helps those souls to get out there and make a move!"
3,3 1/2 Stars -- Entertaining But Not Very Memorable!,"Due to its close, albneit fictitious, association with the show and its producer (Lorne Michaels), the plot of Saturday Night Dead kept me involved in the story moreso than it would have if it was a straight mystery centered around a made-up TV show. However, while the story holds your interest, it is somewhat contrived and the believabilty of some of the characters requires a big stretch of the imagination -- especially, the main character, Harvey Blissberg, who shortly after retiring as a professional baseball player becomes such an adept private-eye that he's able to solve a murder case that the NYC police department can't begin to get close to solving. All this aside, if you're in the mood for a very fast read and a mystery that holds your attention, you could do a lot worse than reading Saturday Night Dead."
2,so-so,"If you want to read a buch of advertizing to order more research products, then this book is the one for you. The only thing I found useful were the county and twp maps. Its not totally worthless, some history in the book, which was interesting but not helpfull in my genealogy work"
4,"Of The Three, I Liked This Story Best","I enjoyed two of the three movies in the ""Sarah, Plain & Tall"" trilogy. This, the final of the three, was definitely one of the ""good ones."" It is an excellent family film with wonderful acting by the three adult stars: Christopher Walken, Glenn Close and Jack Palance.Of the three, that initial ""Sarah,"" was the best-filmed with some beautiful cinematography. This movie didn't have that, but it had the best story in the trilogy. It had some genuinely-tearful sentimental moments and a very nice ending, all of which makes it highly recommended.The storyline is simple but well-told. The only sub-par performance was by one of the kids. It was interesting, though, to see how the kids had grown since that first movie in this trilogy."
2,Sarah plain and tall :Winter's End,"Very dissapointed in the quality of this VHS tape.This third installment does not measure up to the first two. Production values very poor.It looks as if the copy I received was made from a copy, picture was not clear and sound was terrible. I am sending this tape back."
3,Good not great,"I thought Sarah, Plain and Tall was excellent. Skylark was great. Winter's End seemed to have a less-than-great script writer and/or director. It might have been worthwhile to look for different actors for the kids, although I liked seeing them, they were better actors as children. The movie was filled with too many cliches, and the ""passionate"" scenes between father and grandfather seemed very out-of-place, not too convincing. Too bad, because it is decent family entertainment."
5,Sequel,"I loved all three of the movies and have purchased the trilogy also. It is a wonderful, clean, upbuilding movie for families."
4,Tolkien Must-have Book,"Fantastic work! I do wish it was in the larger format, but that aside, it is a treasure for the Tolkien diehard fan. Not only is the artwork superb, but his comments are informative and entertaining. What a talented artist! I have built quite a collection of LOTR items and this book ranks right at the top."
4,Sketch,I baught this for my friend. I recommend it for any artist or sketcher as a great reference for different looks.
4,Amazing drawings with some insight.,Alan Lee's work is amazing and to get some background information about his artwork is a treat. I wish the book was a little bigger and thicker.
5,The Lord of the Rings Sketchbook,"Our son was ""more than pleased"" with this most unusual contributiion to his library. It was on his Wish List, and delighted to receive it for Christmas."
4,Enchanting and Informative,"A must-have for Alan Lee fans. Contains loads of sketches, paintings, and personal musings on his experience while on the set of Peter Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS Saga."
5,excellent stuff,"good collections of the artwork. I held off on getting it for a while, given the somewhat lightweight reviews of the previous folks, but I think it is a pretty good run of pics."
5,They really are the best...,"I used to buy these rice crisps all the time when I was an undergrad in Montreal.... I'd eat them with Fontaine Santé (Fountain of Health) roasted garlic hummus. You can't usually find them in grocery stores in the US (or at least, not in San Diego). It was such a pleasant surprise to be able to buy them off of Amazon! They have exactly the right balance of salt and crunch..... better than any other brand, and usually cheaper, too."
4,Meet Izaak Walton,"I enjoyed this book. I was one the people who had heard (quite a bit, actually) of Izaak Walton's ""Angler"", but had not read it. Prozek's work was the motivation for me to dive into the 17th century for a few hours and read the book. So, if for no other reason, I'm grateful to Prosek. There is a lot here to remind the reader that this is an effort made at the beginning of a literary career; some undisciplined gushing here; a bit of bragging there. But it's hard to deny that there was real effort involved. Prosek has worked on understanding both his subject and himself enough to win me over, even though I'm jealous that he (at least by his account) catches way more fish than I do."
5,blood from the mummy's tomb,what an incredible movie. the story can slow down at times. definitely not a horror flick for everyone. not much blood and gore. but valerie leon makes up for any flaws. highly recommended.
1,Blood from the Mummy's Tomb,I am usually a Hammer lover but I was very disappointed in this movie. I had watched the end of the movie late one night on cable and thought it looked interesting. WRONG! The movie is very slow and not much substance.
4,Blood from Mummy's Tomb does not disappoint,"I had never seen this film before nor had I read much about it until Anchor Bay rescued it. I must say I was pleased -- the film was one of the last made by Hammer & standards at that time were not what they had been in the late 1950's. The cast is very good, the script literate & coherent and the film looks great -- very atmospheric with only a bit of gore. And Valerie Leon is not only lovely -- she can act."
4,Great piece of late Hammer hokum,"Plenty of blood and guts, by Hammer standards anyway, in this 1971 offering from the famous ""House of Horror"". The story concerns an Egyptian princess being reincarnated in modern-day London, thus giving plenty of scope for both contemporary and ancient elements.A very stylish production is directed with plenty of atmosphere by stalwart Seth Holt (Taste of Fear, The Nanny), who sadly died before filming finished. James Villiers stands out for his sliminess as the central villain, where Valerie Leon stands out mainly for her ample bosom. A great cast also includes Andrew Keir and George Coulouris. The score by Tristram Cary (The Ladykillers, Quatermass and the Pit) is pivotal to the tension.In-joke alert: Hammer afficianados should look out for the names on the sign outside Villier's house early on in the movie."
2,Tame mummy movie but Valerie makes it worthwhile,"Looking over all the reviews on this film, I expected it be great but found it to be very tame and somewhat disappointing.There were hardly any scares, the death scenes were tame, and the gore was very, very unrealistic. I wasn't too surprised that this was the last Hammer movie made. There have been better movies using the whole reincarnation mummy /egyptian thing but this one doesn't quite pull it off.There is a lot of style though, a nice musical score, and a beautiful lead by Valerie Leon, but style doesn't mean much without content. Like someone said in a previous review, there is no real terror and no physical threat.The director also died before the film was finished, so there were a few problems with the production of the film.It's an ok horror movie if you like movies with a lot of style, but if you're really looking to get scared and seeking a bit more from this genre, you might seek another title."
4,Blood From The Mummy's Tomb: The Mummy Film Based On A Stoker Book,"TO: Hammer Film FansWARNING! SPIOLERS!The Good:This is a great film based on a Bram Stoker book (Jewel Of the Seven Stars). It dosen't actually have a waling mummy, wrapped up in cloth. Tera is a dark queen of egypt. When a man opens her grave, his wife dies, birthing his daughter. She also dies, but Tera lives inside her. Years later when she gets a ring, tera is relesed inside her, and a ritual to reunite tera with her body begins.The Bad:There is one pothedic scene where a cat statue kills a woman.FROM: The Hammer Film Reveiwer"
4,EDucators should by this...,if You are just starting your ED career you should buy this book!!! This is a great classroom management book and has loads of info for soon to be teachers and teachers :)
1,Not for Newbies,"If you are new to SAP or BW, do not read this book. No step by steps or walkthroughs. I had to constantly goto help.sap.com to understand the concepts."
5,A gem of a book - but very serious typo errors,This book is a gem - an asset to professionals or starters in SAP BW. Not surprising given the credentials of the authors. But there are many very very serious typo errors. Obviously there was little or no proof reading done. Its a shame on Wiley publications !
3,Good to have overview of BW of SAP,This gives you good functional overview but not details for developers.
2,my first humidifier,"I knew I needed a humidifier, and I thought this would be good for a small dorm room (150 sq. ft). It's small and compact and easy to fill. But after a single use, I noticed all this mildew/mold had accumulated on the inside near the base. And just about every time I used it, I've gotten sick. Perhaps my room was too small, but I had to clean the humidifer frequently and I didn't feel like it was very smart at regulating humidity -- just kept on going til it was out of water. Next time I'm getting a humidifer with a FILTER, and one that can regulate humidity."
1,noisy and moldy,"I thought this would be perfect for a bedroom. and maybe it is, as long as you don't plan to sleep! A full tank will run for 6-7 hours, but the machine is incredibly noisy for about the last hour, as the water level gets lower. The sound reminds me of an older model drip coffeemaker. also, the unit needs constant cleaning. About once a week, I had to take it apart and clean out slimy, yellow-ish much that accumulated in the bottom. Didn't make me feel too good about what I was breathing. Also, there's no way to regulate the moisture level, etc. It just goes until it's out of water. I've now replaced this with a different humidifier."
2,Only works for a short time,"I've gone through 2 of these humidifiers in about 3 years. The second one all of a sudden would not turn on yesterday. This humidifier does not provide enough humidity for medium-size rooms and it's a pain to fill the water tank every 6-7 hours. Also, the cleaning procedure is tedious and the bottom of the filter gets tons of slimy build-up and needs to be cleaned every few days. I tried to contact the customer service but got no reply. I'm planning to buy a himidifier from another brand."
5,A great collection of original color,"Originally released in the UK as ""Britain at War in Colour"" it is by the same people behind ""The Second World War in Colour"", which was released in the States as ""World War II the Lost Color Archive"". It follows the same format as the earlier title. John Thaw provides the overall narration, and others read selections from letters and diaries as the images go by. There is no wasted studio time; just original color film from start to end. I don't think this good as the first one (which I called ""the best documentary I've seen""). There is some extended footage of chidren playing, for example that could be from almost anytime, anywhere. However, that still means it's excellent."
2,Really Poor Book!,"I have been re-reading some of the older Feist books in my library and decided to add the rest of his books. I have been reading them in series order according to the recommendation of Feist's site www.crydee.comAll I can say is that you will not miss anything by NOT reading this book.All I can figure is that Feist decided to get a piece of the action off what this guy Rosenberg wrote by adding his name since it takes places in Midkemia that he created. It was slow to the point of dragging so bad that I fell asleep! I had the murderer picked out chapters before the murder was commmitted. There was so much analyzing of what characters were thinking that you could skip ahead and not miss a beat. Of all the Feist books the only other ones that have given me so much plot struggle were the machinations of the Great Game on Kelewan, but at least in that series there were great plot twists and story lines to help hook you back in to the story."
4,An interesting side trip...,"Wasn't sure what to expect but this turned out to be a quick, fun book to read with a hint - unfortunately only a hint - of the original Feist books. If you are looking for a direct link to the Rift War story line, you won't find it here. If you are looking for a fun story set in the same frame then this is the book for you."
3,Good series,"A good series which is a fast exiting, and a great way to separate from every day travails.Leon"
1,"Sorry, but ...","""Honoured Enemy"" set the bar really high for this series. Too bad Book 2 isn't up to the challenge."
3,padding the reviews?,"Odd that J.F. Foster (""Real Name"") and Jason Santiago (""Real Name"") seem to have cut and pasted each other. Makes it look like someone is trying to boost the positive rating."
3,Not a very scholarly work,"The author provides a good, basic introduction to some of the refutations regarding the crux of this book: whether Christianity copied or is an offshoot from Platonic/Neoplatonic philosophies, mystery religions, Gnostic systems, etc.My problem was that this book did not offer the level of erudition one finds in the works of other Christian scholars such as John Meier, Raymond Brown, N.T. Wright, etc. The author provides almost no reference to contemporary sources or original insight into such sources. Rather, the author incorporates very long quotes from other modern writers about these subjects. Those page-long quotes reminded me of my doing the same in high school to pad up my term papers (for which I got a lot of grief from my teachers) so in a sense that's the level at which this book reads. It even makes the author appear to me as if he can hardly read Greek, Hebrew or Latin.Overall, not a bad book but I'm willing to bet there are much better books on this matter."
1,Never got my book,"I am still waiting for my book, it never came, I order 5 total, 4 arrived and still waiting on this book. I am serving in the armed forces in Baghdad and very disappointed in this order"
1,MADE IN CHINA,"Gave this away as well as a few other toys I bought from Amazon. At the Amazon site, I searched for toys made in America. Bought four toys that came up in this search ... All four were MADE IN CHINA!"
5,Best Baby Doll Ever!,"This baby doll is incredibly adorable. Life like in every way with toes, fingers, belly button, etc. I love how soft the doll is, the ability to remove and replace the diaper with ease. The doll is snug-able and soft while still being stiff enough to place into positions. The doll is much more flexible than it appears in the picture."
2,Not giftworthy!,"I ordered this doll for my niece, and although the doll itself seems ok, it came packaged in a clear plastic bag with no information at all about the doll. It looks very cheesy! I'm so glad I had this sent to my house, rather than directly to my niece. Now, I'll just have to find a way to repackage the doll so it'll be gift worthy. I'll probably just send it back and find something locally."
4,Very soft sweet little doll,"We have had this doll for a year. And the first thing my toddler did was take all of it's clothes off. If possible do not remove the stitch that attaches the hat. You will never get it to stay on once you do, so ours is lost. Very very soft material and great for hugging. Good size for doll strollers and the diaper and shirt has velcro fasteners so it's easy for a small child to dress. This would be a great doll for a child who has a new brother or sister. Then they can have a new baby too :) Especially with the id bracelet it's very special."
2,NOT Made in America!!!,"That is unless CHINA is now in America.I specifically bought this because Amazon has it listed under its Made in America category and I am trying to purchase gifts made here. I don't know whose error it is, Amazon or false advertising by North American Bear Company.The doll itself is exactly as pictured and is very nice. It will make a good 1st birthday present for my niece. But now I know that I can't trust Amazon with regard to where items are manufactured. I intend to file a complaint with Amazon as well. If you are also trying to shop for American goods be forewarned that this doll is not one of them.Since it hasn't been used yet, I can't rate it for durability but if it had been made here I would have rated it 5 stars."
2,NOT MADE IN AMERICA (North American Bear Co. Rosy Cheeks Boy Doll),"I purchased this North American Bear Company Rosy Cheeks Baby Blonde Boy specifically because it came up under a ""Made in America"" search, but lo and behold, upon delivery, I discover it is MADE IN CHINA! ARGH!! I am very disappointed in Amazon. The doll is being returned. Truthful origin of manufacture on your website items would be a service to the purchasers who are trying to buy MADE IN AMERICA/MADE IN THE USA products."
3,Not as cute as expected,"This is a ""nice"" doll but not nearly as gorgeous as I had hoped for. I was going to buy this for my daughter for Christmas but have decided to send it back because I just don't think it's that cute :-( The fabric and construction is good quality and I think this toy would last lots of cuddles and trips through the washing machine. The top was a bit flimsy and floppy. The one I received didn't have the velcro fastening in the correct position so the top gaped. For me the search continue for the right soft fabric doll."
4,"Good Movie, but poor dvd quality","My son absolutely loves this movie! He could not wait to get it and watched it so many times already!However, in 2010 a dvd should not look like a video tape on your TV. I don't know if it's because I have an hdtv, but the quality was extremely poor."
1,Horrible,"Of course my daughter had to rent this from the RedBox. This has got to be the worst thing ever associated with the Super Mario Bro's and Nintendo. I am shocked Nintendo allowed this to be made. I'm not sure when this was made but the transfer to DVD is so bad, it's like it was just copied straight from a VHS tape that some one found at Goodwill. The short cartoon segments are probably the worst cartoon I have ever seen. Why they are even in stone age times is also completely ridiculous."
3,One size regular a bit small,"I found the thong to be a bit small. I'm a size 12 but didn't think I needed the plus size. Besides that, its just not as sexy as it seemed on the pic."
3,Disappointing.,"The thong was fabric was horrible. It was extremely uncomfortable and the beck part of it ripped as soon as I put it on. The Garter it's self is OK. Not amazing. It's plastic clasps to hold up the stockings which won't last very long. IT RUNS SMALL!!!! Although the shipping came a day earlier than expected. Over all, I was pretty disappointed."
3,thong nice,if you like thongs but belt was not useful as I still do not have thigh high white stockings... hmm
3,"Pretty good quality, but symmetrically challenged","Certainly good for the price! It looks exactly like the picture. Garter belt is adjustable, flattering, sits nicely, and seems like it would fit a good range of sizes (around 2-12). The lace is decent, it doesn't look cheap or anything. The thong, not so much; I'm a size 6 and it had a little too much fabric at the front (not too distracting, though). The thong would probably would fit sizes 8-10 best.My biggest complaint is that the front & back aren't symmetrical if it's not adjusted to a certain size; it should really be adjustable on both sides, but you can only adjust one, so unless the desired width is just right, it'll look off-kilter from the back."
2,"Not very flattering, poor quality","The lace material is of poor quality; the garter belt seems to pinch in all the wrong places and doesn't stay adjusted (so basically it doesn't hold your stockings up). The matching thong has a synthetic liner, and is made cheaply."
3,Super Sexy,"Bought it to go with my halloween costume... Its nice and light weight. The only thing is my waist is 27-29"" and securing it to stay on ur waist is a bit difficult and bulky..."
1,kinda disappointing,"In this pictures, this garter belt looks fantastic, but when I tried it on and I found there was really no place to put genitals, I was really put down.By the way, I'm a cross dresser."
1,chintzy,"I haven't ever been satisfied with the quality of leg avenue products but I guess i was seduced by the low price. Still not worth it. I am on the small side (size 4) and find that this thing doesn't stay up properly, the fastening clips pop off and the product is shoddily made and started pilling almost immediately out of the package. rather than holding hose up it gets pulled down. shoot. shipped fast though but it just mean disappointment was more immediate."
4,"good product, came fast","Product arrived promptly and pretty much what I expected. Thong was really small so I don't know how it was ""one size fits all,"" but otherwise product was overall good."
3,"Chap Material, decent product","The product fits fine, and the price reflects the quality of the material. I'm 5'1'' and 130 lbs so I think someone with wider hips would have some problems with the fit of the thong, but it's nice that the garter belt itself is adjustable in the back which you can't see from the pictures."
2,its ok,just tried it on to see how it would fit and it is very difficult to adjust the straps and the belt falls down occassionally would recommend getting a different pair that is better quality
3,"Functional, but cheap","You get what you pay for. The belt works just fine, but is certainly not great quality. I'm a size 6-8 and the one-size fits best above my bellybutton. Still fits, though. Good for the bedroom. The thong is flimsy. Probably won't bother wearing it."
1,What size was this?,"Shipping was quick, which is the only reason i will give this product a star. I purchased this set in plus size. The garter had a small part that was unraveling before i even got it off its hanger. The thong was plus size? My size 6 sister couldn't even fit in it comfortably."
2,"Looks great, but doesn't do much","I was looking for a garter belt that would work functionally - aka hold up my stockings - more importantly than looking good. This item is comfortable, and the bits that hook to the stockings seem to work fine. However, it is extraordinarily stretchy, to a fault. I put it on, and after a couple hours it had slipped from my 34' waist, around my 44' butt, and then down to my thighs, failing to hold up the stockings, or even itself. I ordered the plus size version because I wear a size 14/16 and generally anything that says ""one size"" means one size will not fit me.. and it is the right size for my waist at the smallest setting, until it stretches all the way out and falls down. Fortunately, I have the sewing skills to give it some structure and make it functional, but I wouldn't recommend the purchase."
4,Great Value for Those With Hips,"Don't get me wrong. I love these and they look really sexy on my girlfriend. The quality is surprisingly good. The stockings are not very durable, but what do you expect for this price? The only real problem is that they are made for someone with at least 35"" hips. The garter quickly drooped on my size 2 girlfriend. That is why I deducted a star."
4,"Good, but not too good.","This set fits nicely, and the fabric is comfortable. Yet, the lace knit is slightly a little too loose, meaning not only does the lace look a little weird, but it feels slightly rough too. I understand some people like a looser lace, though. The garters work fine, and have a nice expanding section like bra straps, which result in giving a much better fit than some other garters. The clips hold up just as well as other ones."
2,Too one sided. Scares parents. Read Sears book.,"I wouldn't recommend this. The book by Sears is the best, and I gave that one 5 starts and 100% recommend it. This book will scare any parent out of even considering giving their children any vaccines, and isn't that just as bad as blindly agreeing without knowing more? In order to make an informed decision, whatever decision a parent makes, one needs to know both sides of the argument, not be frightened into making one choice or another. Reading the Sears book gave me the opportunity to make my decisions (you have many decisions to make and many options to choose from) knowing both the sides of the vaccine arguement and feel confident about what I've decided."
4,Very informative.,This book had a lot of statistics on vaccinations. Its very informative with a lot of graphs and references. I got a lot of good information out of this book.
5,Great Book,I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn the truth of vaccines. Every mother needs this book.
1,Another anti-vaccine nonsense book,"One wonders why there seems to be an industry that picks on the single most effective public health measure in human history, vaccines. Vaccination ranks up there with good nutrition and flush toilets as the main reasons we are alive and healthy today. Mr. Miller plays with our collective amnesia for what it was actually like before widespread vaccination was adopted in the 20th Century. I guess it will actually take a series of epidemics before people realize that everyone should be vaccinated.This book is filled with pseudo-science, blatant falsehood, and limited understanding of what these diseases are actually like. It would be almost laughable it it wasn't so dangerous by discouraging people to vaccinate their children."
1,"1 Star, because I can't give it 0","Congratulations, folks. Don't get your child vaccinated. Then, when your child dies from H flu menigitis or suffers permanent brain damage; gets polio (especially on the Southern border) and dies or suffers permanent damage; gets diptheria, tetanus, whooping cough --- DO NOT SUE YOUR DOCTOR. BLAME ONLY YOURSELF."
3,Vaccine concerns,Another useful set of relevant information is presented for the reader to examine in detail. Well done Miller.
1,Not a good use of Statistics,"Unfortunately, this book skews evidence in order to make parents so paranoid of vaccinations that they will conclude that all the world's evils potentially came from them (cancer, AIDS, drug abuse, violent crime, ADHD, autism, and more are all linked to vaccines in the book). In the first 40 pages alone, I tagged no less than 7 misuses of statistics and data. Mark Twain said, ""There are three types of lies - lies, damn lies, and statistics."" This book has mastered the latter."
2,so-so,"a so-so book. very slated, and very difficult to read. there are other books that cover this topic better but if this was your only choice it would work."
1,very poorly researched,Don't be fooled- with lots of references and graphs it looks well-researched. It is not. I have checked references and they are cited incorrectly and do not back up the author's claims. Many are not current and the author cherry-picks the ones that appear to back up his point of view. The graphs are flashy but misleading. Just remember anyone can write a book- it does not make it true.
3,Great Collection CD.,"This is a MUST HAVE for any Hombres G or David Summers fan, it is not easy to find, its a collective item."
5,Finally!,"I saw Batdorf and Rodney several times and was never disappointed with their guitar stylings, the blend of their voices, or the message in their songs. Fans of Brewer & Shipley who don't know John and Mark need to check out their work."
4,Batdorf & Rodney bat one out of the park !,"This duo produced a handful of LP's in the 70's but this one stands out among their output. Great singing and ringing acoustic guitar play.Reminds me of Seals & Croft on steroids. Nice trip down memory lane. Highly recommended if you're into the sound of the Buffalo Springfield(coincidently this duo was nurtured by Ahmet Ertegun who gave the Springfield their start). Only reason I didn't give this CD a 5 star rating isdue to the fact that, to my ears, the vocal mix is somewhat thin and harsh in parts. Performance wise - 5 stars !!"
4,Excellent Set,"The last reviewer is correct to point out the color is slightly different. There's a hint of purple that isn't apparent in the product photo. Mind you, it's more blue than purple, but it's a different blue than pictured. Also, the plates and bowls are very thin and light, which is a matter of taste. If that still sounds good to you, go ahead and purchase this, because it's a great set. My fiancee and I are very happy with ours. One good thing - the bowls are generously sized, unlike my last set. If you like soup as much as I do you'll appreciate that :-)"
4,"Not quite what I expected, but still very pretty","I have bought Corelle dishes in the past and have absolutely loved them! They are very durable and stack neatly in the cabinets and dishwasher. I wanted a change of style, so I chose Bahia because of the pretty blue swirls. Yet, when they arrived, I discovered the color is more purple/ lavender than blue. The pics online are not representative of the actual color. Although they don't match my other dishware, they are still quite pretty."
4,pretty good,it arrived in 8 days the charger didnt excatly7 fit but it charged it over all pretty good purchase for $3
1,It was not what was advertised,"This was supposed to be an actual Samsung product, it was a knockoff. It broke the first day. The connector just came off with no misuse.It came in a plain white box, with no Samsung logo on the charger."
4,Point of view and dialogue,"If you seek to learn point of view and dialogue, Hildick is your man. Cut and polished, no fluff. I recommend this work to anyone learning the art of writing."

4,Something Missing Here,"Has good elliments but the story is either lacking substance or maybe I expected it to be more of a spagheti western in story. Great characters - Bronson actually is more believable here than a couple other spaghet's he is in, and Mifune is always the consumate samurai. Would recomend with one proviso - I probably will not wear this one out from watching more than a few times."
4,East meets Western!!!,"I really like this movie! Its an original story being that it includes a samurai with cowboys in the ""old west"". I love Charles Bronson and Toshira Mifune. Most people have heard of Charles Bronson but not Toshira who has been in some great movies so research him! I really like that Mr. Charlie Bronson played a character that joked a bit and had a sense of humor and was fun. Just a different sort of role than he usually played, still a tuff guy, but more down to earth and funny, very cool! I am glad I added this to my collection!"
4,Red Sun.,"Good movie of a unlikely alliance if bizarre plot yet worth watching because of Charles Bronson and his performance,not really a spaghetti western or western in my opinion but a cheesy yet enjoyable movie."
3,DVD is worth having; story is far fetched,"As a huge Chuck Bronson fan I wanted to have this film for my collection and glad I now do. The story is kind of 'dumb' really about a samurai and a train robber teaming up to find a stolen sword. But in the film you do get to see a 'lighter' side of Charles Bronson at times laughing and being a bit of a 'rogue' here and that was rare during his long career. Toshiro Mifune is amusing as the 'fish out of water' character a samurai warrior in the Old West. Alain Delon on the other hand, is absurd as a ""French Cowboy/Gunslinger"". A French Cowboy? Come on--and I'm French! Ursula Andress is also along for the journey and tho looking gorgeous completely adds nothing to the story.About the DVD itself, I have nothing but praise. The picture and sound were great and at under $15 from a reliable Amazon seller, I was happy with my purchase."
1,Beware of Well Packaged Bootleg,"Movie excellent Bronson/Mifune; DVD release horrible. I received the version with the white backdrop with the red sun and color sketch of Bronson, Mifune, Andres, and Stamp on the cover. On the packaging Evergreen Entertainment is indicated as the DVD producer; in the Amazon description it refers to Evergreen as the Studio. It looks like quatlity from the outside and says it has been remastered and that format is letterbox. Not true. It is a poor transfer form a video and is cropped, not even close to letterbox and the sound is poorly mastered. Even the menu mispells words. Amazon has really confounded reviews that try to protect other buyers of DVDs and CDs by combining the reviews for all prints of movies and CDs. Good luck in sifting through the offerings now. I will get a good print and letterbox of this movie if I can find one with confidence, but cannot so far."
2,Looks like a bootleg,The print is not sharp. It looks like when movies air on UHF channels in the 80's.Worth getting only if the price is $10 or under.The movie is o.k. and Bronson is at his best.
5,Essential soul classics,"Both sides of all 14 singles recorded for Goldwax Records, 1964-1970, making for 28 tracks of essential Memphis soul from one of the greats. Carr never got the recognition, but his talent was comparable to Otis Redding's even if his material and backing were sometimes less stellar. Still, there are some true classics here and even the weaker material is elevated by Carr's gritty, muscular pipes. A truly excellent booklet with pictures and notes for each track rounds out an exceptional set."
3,okay as a data cable,"I have a Z710i, and the data cable works okay as a data cable. Connecting isn't as quick as I would like, but I don't think that's the cable's fault -- I'm fairly certain it's the phone's fault.My beef with the data cable is that my phone will not charge through it. It seems like quite an oversight, for a USB cable to not incidentally charge the connected device if the user wants it to."
1,F***kin pist,"after the second time i connected the cable, the cable housing; EVERYWHERE started to peel off. So now i have a cable covered with electrical tape."
2,Not that good,"I like hummus, but this stuff is not nearly as good as fresh. We tired of it quickly and ended up giving away most of it. Its not ""bad"", its just not that good, rather bland and oily."
2,Watery Hummus?!?!?!?,"I typically make my own hummus at home, but this past week for lack of time I bought some Yehuda Hummus in the grocery store here in Panama. The picture on the front of the can looks a lot like what I call Hummus, thick and creamy, full of healthy ingredients. When I opened the can to eat it I was quite surprised that the ""Hummus"" was really really watery and looked like it was better suited for drinking than for dipping. It wouldn't stick on my carrots and you certainly couldn't spread it as nothing would stay on a knife. I'm not sure if I just received an off batch or if they are trying to get more profits by watering down their hummus, but that was a big disappointment and I would never buy this brand again or recommend it to anyone!"
1,ADT,Once again confusing profiteering with prophet steering-Rabbi plays the bait and switch. Ingredients on amazonclearly state soybean oil but on the can is listed ascottonseed a potential pesticide and industrial chemicalladen oil which is unfit for consumption and is used inonly the poorest quality big agribusiness-sellout items.I will send this back or throw it in the trash and not purchasethis poor excuse for kosher product line again.Why detox when we can prevent putting toxins in our bodiesto begin with. Yes I am Jewish.
5,"Quick, convenient, tasty",No complaints at all about this product. It's healthy and convenient. What more can you ask for?
3,A good detective/mystery novel with interesting sub-plots,"The mystery novel seems to be lacking in the past ten years, but Karon does an excellent job of reviving the genre. Father Tim is the best undercover agent I've seen in years. His sleuthing powers are great. Out to Canaan has plot twists and surprises around every corner. Why only a 3 star rating/ Well, I couldn't figure out the addition of the parakeet selling widow in chapter 8 and it seemed to distract from the main plot too much. Be on the lookout for the mysterious Cynthia in Chapter 3, the vegetarian travel agent, she will surprise you in chapter 12. A good book for detective/mystery novel fans."
5,A promised land of storytelling,"I enjoyed this one the best of all, over the past three books the development of the characters has evolved, not only in the authors writing but in my mind as well. It is a pleasure to pick up this book and feel, on the very first page, at home. I am just starting the new one and am a little bit melancholy realizing we may have to wait a while for a new one. Anyone who wants to read a great wholesome, very spiritual book will want to read this one. I cried at the end...so, my hat is off to Jan Karon. Keep it up..."
5,The Best Yet in the Series,"This book is the best so far in the series. Isn't it just great when a series gets better and better instead of disappointing readers by declining? Jan Karon has done it again and writes a winner of a book. In this fourth book in the series, Father Tim's relationships with many of the characters evolves, as do the characters themselves."
5,"Fantastic, funny and heart warming. Leaves you feeling good.","These books were given to me as a gift with rave reviews. Since I am a retired Episcopalian Church Secretary, I found the book amusing, interesting, heartwarming and pretty close to what goes on in the churches. The author seems to pull you right into the book and you feel like you are one of the Mitfordians. There were times I just rolled with laughter and times I sat and cried. I totally recommend this series to anyone that likes to have a warm fuzzy feeling."
5,Jan Karon Leaves You Wanting MORE!,"A friend from California sent me all four books while I was recovering from ankle surgery. I couldn't stop reading! All four books are a delight, and I can't wait for the fifth (I've heard it is on the way!) to be available. The characters are all so well-developed, they feel like old friends. I've started 3 friends on the series, and they're all hooked. Thanks Jan Karon for bringing the wonderful village of Mitford to print!"
5,Another Thank Goodness!,"Recently, Catwalk Fashionista stopped manufacturing and selling its wonderful, creamy shampoo made specifically for color-treated hair much to my dismay:( Just a tiny bit of this shampoo develops into a lavish lather when warm water is added. Thus, a 12 oz. bottle lasts for a long,long time. Amazon.com was sharp enough to add Fashionista products to their list of on-line sellers and I will be eternally grateful! Thank you Amazon.com"
5,Question to the original,"I prefer the original italian version. And I would like to order it here, but it's not possible."
3,"Some great songs, not too amazing though","I have only listened to this CD once or twice so I haven't really given the songs a chance to grow on me. But the first few are great, I love their beat and the lyrics are good. It's sort of inconsistent because some songs are really good and others are just whatever."
5,I really like this CD,I first heard Laura No Esta in Costa Rica and I fell in love with it so I bought the album when I got home. The whole album is very good and his voice is very sexy. Its a good CD to listen to at bedtime.
5,Just what I was looking for!,"Harvard Graphic was exactly what I was looking for to present aschool presentation. It had most of the capibilities of""Powerpoint"" without spending the money. Easy Directions, great color! For the presentation beginner, this is all you'll need."
1,THIS PRODUCT IS A LOAD OF......,"im here thinking this thing would be helping me out, not making more unwanted wiring! PORT ONE or whatever you call it is the only one that WORKS and PORT TWO is jus plain old DEAD. not to mention they gave me two but THEY STILL DONT WORK!"
3,PS3 And Splitter,"I want to hook up my PS3 to the internet but, my computer and PS3 are far away from eachother so I cant just switch the ethernet cable between the two. I don't want to spend $30 on a router. I was wondering if this product would be worth while getting to hook up my PS3 to the internet without buying a router and having to switch a ethernet cable out everytime I want to use the internet on my computer or the PS3?"
4,"Works perfect, but with their was a female version!","Using two of these and a coupler, it's easy to utilize one wire to get two ports at a single location, without having to use a switch. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is they don't offer a male and a female. Just a male. So, you have to use a coupler to get it to work on one end. I don't like any additional connections. More room for fault and interference."
2,Didn't Work for Me!!!,"My problem: Only one ethernet cable to the 3 rd story with a router on the 1 st floor. I wanted to Hookup both a Roku player and a computer on the 3rd floor.My solution: One each of these units at each end. A Combiner (from 2 router ports into one wall RJ45) and Splitter (from one wall RJ45 to a computer and Roku player. I Thought!!!!The result was differant. I can only have one device on at a time. Raku player or computer. One seems to dominate the other. If I unplug the computer, the Roku unit works. If I unplug the Roku unit, the computer works.I guess I will have to run an additional cable."
1,Non-functioning cable splitter,"This product failed to work from the moment I connected it. I have 2 computers, but only use one at a time. When I plugged the splitter in I was hoping to be able to use one computer then shut it down and go to the other computer boot it up and use it. Unfortunately I couldn't get the first computer to connect to the web so I went back to plugging in one computer then unplugging it and plugging the other computer as needed."
1,not for me,"i should had read the reviews, this indeed is for IT professionals. i initially bought this coz i have two routers set up with IP addresses from different countries & figured this would let me have both connected & working at the same time from a single modem, sadly it doesn't work this way. thought it would be simple & do the job like a Speaker and Headphone Splitter does, anyway i'm sure this works for w/e its intended for just not for what i wanted it for."
1,cable splitter,"i got this expctng a 2 way splitter but only one slot worked on it, any other cable splitter would work but this cheap piece of crap!!!!!!!!!"
2,Split and Not Working,"Expected the splitter to be used to allow 2 computers to operate on 1 internet line-Couldn't make work-appears the device is not wired to do this without modifications-$20.00 for a desk drawer deweller-Oh well ""somedays chicken-somedays feathers"""
2,Splitter,"The splitter I purchased, has a dysfunctional jack, which defeats the whole purpose of buying one. I expected both jacks to work so I could use the internet in my room along with my roommate. However, the second jack does not work and I do not like that."
2,spliiter,this one is 50/50 you may get lucky i did not did not work. i would spend more as they say you pay for what you get. im starting to learn that. ok i came back and had to edit but this got me too i tried it only one side worked so i ordered a very good one same thing i thought two can't be bad i was trying to hook up my playstation so i called sony they said the modem needed more bandwith i have comcat so i called and they said the modem could not be split that explained everything so all in all they sent me a wireless router the spliiter is most likely good it is the modem so call your ISP and see if your modem can be split hope this helps it would have helped me.
1,Does not split,"This product does not split an ethernet cable, so don't buy if you have that use for this product. I bought this to split my internet so that I could play Netflix through my Wii. Just keep in mind this may work for other things but not to split internet connection. I even tried to connect only my computer, and it does not work for that purpose. Not worth sending back for refund, so I may eventually come up with another idea for this, so am keeping it."
1,Bad Product,"I ordered this product and received it in a timely matter, which is the only good thing I can say about this company. The product didn't work and when I asked to exchange or return the item, they took forever to email me back. When they did, they said there were no exchanges and that I would have to send the item back as a return and pay for the shipping myself. They would only accept it back as a UPS ground shipment, so it would have cost me more than I paid for it to actually ship it back to them. They also said there would be a 3-4 week period before I would get my money back. It would not have been worth it."
1,The ethernet splitter,"The RJ-45 Ethernet splitter was not what I was expecting. The flyer which accompanied the splitter reads:""Part 37133 is not a true splitter in the sense that most people use the term.""This statement should have been displayed on the web site which sells the splitter."
1,not a true spliter need two to work,never stated that two would be required to use a single wire in side the wall one at the router and one at the two devices you want to connect.
1,Does not work,"My first splitter worked for one day, than stopped working.Customer service was ok, send me a free replacement. Replacement didn't work at all.STAY AWAY FROM THIS."
3,Decent Product,"Internet only works through one side of the splitter. I'm not sure if that is how the product is supposed to work, but I was looking for internet to work through cords plugged in to either side of the splitter."
3,Question before PURCHASE,"OK, first i know how this is suppose to work, TECHIES SHOULD REALLY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS LOLRouter > 2 cables > splitter > cable running through the wall > splitter > 2 cables (one for each device).But i want to know will this work if i plug up the last two cables to an xbox and the other to a ps3??? i have two kids each with the own console but only one of my sons' room has the actual wall jack in his room that is connected through the wall to the living room dsl modem. since their rooms are side by side i was thinking this could work since my other son came home from college i could use the other port and plug it in...So basically will this work for the use of both sons using their online features for their console?? if not any suggestions in other products that could work.THANX"
3,how to use the item,"First off, I didn't buy these from this vendor but have used this product and brand in the past. I just wanted to help if there are any questions about how these work. You have to use these in pairs. The scenario where you would use these is if you have one network port in your office and want two. You would plug a splitter in the wall jack and and then the other splitter into the patch panel port. If you are just using a cable instead of wall plates and patch panels you will also need to Cat5 couplers. Then run two patch cables from the splitter in the office to two computers. At the other end run two patch cables from the splitter into your switch."
4,Understand what you are buying,"Disregard any reviews that claim this device doesn't work, or works ""only half"". The description of this item could be more detailed and clear, specifically that you have to buy them IN PAIRS (which I think should be the default packaging qty). As a previous reviewer said, this is NOT a switch. 100BT ethernet connections (not power-over-ethernet) only require 4 pins to operate, and a standard fully-wired CAT5UTP cable has 8 wires (4 pair). All this does is use the ""unused"" pairs and move them to the unused section of the wire. The other end / second of these breaks it back out.You HAVE to have all 8 wires testing good, and connected to your port or patch panels. Not all installers do this, or test the unused wires or pins.I cannot speak for the seller of this device yet, however."
1,Not pleased.,"I got the product on time, but the product did not work properly. I tried to contact the company who sells them, and they never got back with me. Poor product, poor service."
1,Does not do what you want it for.,"If you are looking for a splitter that will allow you to switch between one wired device and the another easily, this is not it. Regardless of the price, it is not worth it. I constantly had to disconnect one or both devices so that I could use them. I was better off not buying anything."
1,a piece of trash,"this thing did not work. i plugged it in and only one side worked, then after a bout two weeks it stopped working completely. i bought two and the same thing happened on both of them."
1,Don't order if you need a splitter!,"I ordered this product because I have 2 pieces audio equipment for my recording studio that connect to a computer via RJ45 cables. Rather than get a network switch or hub with many ports for my 2 cables, I decided to go with this product since it states it serves as a splitter in the product title.First, the product that arrived looked distinctly different that the pictures. It is similar, but different nonetheless. When I connected my two cables and plugged it into my computer with the two cables connected properly, it only one of the devices. It came with explicit instructions and a flow chart for use (that should be included here) that explains basically that it is not a sole splitter for two cables."
1,Not what I needed,"I have no idea what this product does. Let me tell you that it does not ""split"" your internet signal to run multiple hard-wired devices. So when I searched ""internet splitter"" on Amazon, this probably shouldn't have been the 2nd hit. I wasted 2 bucks..oh well."
1,Question,"I just got a Sprint airave as I have no signal in my apartment. It connects to the modem but my modem only has one LAN jack. Will this work for this? I'm thinking to plug the male piece into the back of the modem, then I can connect the airave to one and the ISP's ethernet cable to the other."
3,Cables to Go 37133 2-Port RJ45 Splitter,"Wasn't really happy with this product. Did not perform as I had hoped it would have. I will keep it, though, because it may work in another way."
3,Splitter,"So I got this hoping that I could have internet go to both my Xbox and my computer through two ethernet cords. Turns out, this does not do that. You can only use one at a time. Darn."
1,Expected this to work like a phone splitter,"It doesn't and it's too expensive to pay to return this useless, for my needs, item. The item's description is seriously misleading."
1,Sent 1/2 of the order!,Do not order from this company. They sent half my order. I contacted them 3 different times and they still won't send the rest!
3,uncertain,"I have not gotten to use this item yet. Apparently, not just any ethernet cable will work with your specific modem. so do your homework!!!"
1,it didn't work,I got this to add a line to my dvr. I plugged in both lines and then into my computer and nothing.. I still have it because it would cost me to ship it back.
1,My 2 Cents,"According to what I understood in the product description, I could plug this into an ethernet port and be able to run 2 separate ethernet cables and have them both work. It did not work. Perhaps I didn't understand the function of the splitter. Either way, it didn't work as a splitter."
1,Do not buy this item,This thing does not work. It is suppose to be a splitter for RJ45 so you can have two computers using one drop. Doesn't do it! One or the other computer will work but not both online at the same time. What value is that to anyone and why would they sell this for that purpose if it doesn't do what it says. I would return it except why pay more money?
2,not good,"it works, but it keeps and going on and off. one time it works, then the next time it doesnt"
3,mistake,cant write a true review about this. i bought it without actually looking what it does i just looked at the title. im sure the product works but if your looking to plug it into one jack and get two connections it wont work for you. make sure you read what you purchase.
1,did not work for me,"This didn't work for me. Only one port would pass ethernet traffic. I tried connecting to a switch and a hub, with the same results."
1,C2G RJ45 Splitter,"One jack of splitter failed after little use. Product rating: thumbs down!C2G / Cables to Go 37133 2-Port RJ45 Splitter/Combiner Cable, Gray 6-Inch (Single Unit*)."
2,A classic of needless customer confusion,"By not selling this in pairs many e-tailers (Radio Shack too) instill a misapprehension in the minds of casual shoppers, the proverbial 99% of whom are probably after a different product, i.e. a powered network switch. Of the 1% who actually need *THIS* item, why would they purchase just a single unit? I suppose in that rare case where you're able to re-wire the terminals at one end of the run but not at the other... Pretty silly; gotta wonder at the overall $$$ hit here from stocking, shipping, and then processing returns the next week from disgruntled people."
3,Save your money!!,"ok its not that this item is too costly but theres cheaper ays to do the same thing here are some things you need to use this item.1: two Ethernet couplers,2:Four three to five feet long ethernet cables3:One longer Ethernet cable etc 100 ft4:2 Ethernet splitters (this product)($40.72 not counting s&h;)or you could buy just Two long ethernet cables (100 ft) and run them to your office($15.36 not counting s&h;)and then (my personal favorite way)buy these things.1 long ethernet cable (100ft)4 short ethernet cable (5ft)1 4 port ethernet hub.($24.37)all itemsRJ45 Coupler F-F StraightCables to Go 37133 2-Port RJ45 Splitter/Combiner Cable, Gray 6-Inch (Single Unit*)Dynex DX-EHB4 - Hub - 4 ports - Ethernet - 10Base-T - DC power - externalRiteAV - Cat5e Network Ethernet Cable - Blue - 5 ft.RiteAV - Cat5e Network Ethernet Cable - Blue - 100 ft. [Office Product]happy shopping hope this helps"
3,Just READ the reviews before buy it.,"Just READ the reviews before buy it.This is not for splitting two ethernet so that you would make one ethernet cable to make two computers internet work. For that you need to have router, and if you read review carefully, you would be able to find one that is good for you.Don't waste money like me because of not reading reviews carefully."
5,Perfect!,"I am very impressed with this 3-Pc. Smokey Quartz set. Pretty enough to give to my best friend. Not too small, and really beautiful. Just right. Thank you!"
5,"Excellent,Fun Non-Stop Video Action!!","In this video,you'll be amazed to watch and share the experience of some of the worlds most powerful machines that includes,trucks,jets,helicopters and ultra lights,speedboats,sailboats,jet skis,heavy metal machines,race cars plus cycle power,buses and overall wheels at work.This video is fun for the entire family especially for children ages 3-8!!"
4,OK,This movie was just ok for me. I thought the characters were too far apart in age. The man was funny though. I thought the lady carried her sadness over her doomed affair a little too far. I wasn't all that crazy about the ending. The acting was good.
5,Works great!,"I love the retro style. It feels plenty solid for what I paid for it. It works very well. The only negative is a strange ""hot"" smell when I use it, kind of like when you turn on a space heater and there's dust on the coils. What's up with that? But so far it's working great, so I'm ignoring the smell."
5,Perfect,"I have a 2005 Hyundai Accent GLS, the kit fit perfectly, just snapped the 2 side pieces on, slid the kit on the radio and used the screws that came with the radio to secure it on, couldn't be any easier, thanks"
4,"Art, for God's Sake",Well written support for my purpose - visual arts as expression of love of God's creation.
3,"True, Simple, Maybe Obvious","This short book is helpful for building a theological basis for understanding the value art from God's perspective. I did think the book was overly simple, and I wish there were more examples or illustrations for helping me understand the Christian standards of truth, beauty, and goodness. The book left me wanting to know more about the seemingly preference-based standard of beauty."
1,Art for God's Sake,"This was a short essay on the topic, not much to it, a little bit of repeat for me from reading The Creative Call."
4,Art and Reformed Theology,"This short and concise book is extremely helpful for pastors looking for the intersection of theology and the arts. Ryken presents a biblical case for the Artist's calling; God's appreciation and love for all types of Art; God's standard for goodness, beauty, and truth and it's application in Art; God himself as Artist and Creator; and how to do and redeem Art for the glory of God. This book presents the goodness of God's original design for creativity and beauty that was marred by the fall. God is renewing all thing including Art, and Art can present the truth of beauty redeemed through the Savior and Redeemer."
4,Four classic film comedies on two DVD'S for one low price!,"Hanover House's ""Classic Comedy Laugh-Pack"" DVD is an absolute must have for the advent comedy fan!!! This set contains four great film comedies on 2 Discs.Disc one is Abbott & Costello's 1949 classic AFRICA SCREAMS and Laurel & Hardy's THE FLYING DEUCES from 1939.Disc two contains the 1936 classic screwball comedy MY MAN GODFREY and a collection of three W.C. Fields shorts THE GOLF SPECIALIST (1930- his first talkie!),THE DENTIST (1932),and THE FATAL GLASS OF BEER (1933).The picture and sound qualities are superb,especially AFRICA SCREAMS and MY MAN GODFREY while THE FLYING DEUCES and the three W.C. Fields shorts don't fair as better.But nonetheless,it's a terrific set,but it's definately worth buying for AFRICA SCREAMS!!! Get this set and enjoy some funny and hilarious film comedies in the luxury of your own home!!"
5,I love the Spa Girls....,"From the outside, Morgan Malliard seemed to have it all ~ diamonds at her disposal, a father whom seemed to do anything for her...or did he?!? When you find out in the novel that Morgan's father had her sign papers about tax evasion/fraud, I was like, WHAT!?!!!?!? What an unexpected TWIST...and then when he threw the paperweight at her head that landed Morgan in the hospital...WOW, what a father, eh?!!?!!? I just LOVE the Spa Girls, and seeing what will happen next in their adventures.....be sure that you don't miss the 3rd book in the series, ""Calm, Cool & Adjusted""....."
5,Twists and Turns and Great Again!,"I love this series. I don't read that much fiction, but this is the one author I pre-order! When I think I know what is going to happen next in the book, everything changes. We can all see ourselves in different aspects of the characters, for good or bad. Billerbeck has teriffic insight in to character and society. What a gift to all of us!"
1,Torture,"I am sorry to ruin the high raiting but for me this book is a torture, I am not even sure I'll be able to finish reading it ... it's such a pain to read this book.And what's up with all the being Catholic thing .... there is too much religion in it, and I am not saying it because religion is a bad thing, but only because if I wanted to read about Jesus and the Church I would have bought a book about it ... this is supposed to be a fun novel but it is too concentrated on the girl's religion .... I would have probably appreciated it more if the writer added people from other religions and would have talked about it, instead ... she mentions that one guy is Catholic but his parents are not .... (how did that happen?!) and they are not happy that he is, but it doesn't mention what the parents are.Horrible, horrible book. Doesn't flow, I don't like the way the author writes, it's not funny at all, just a pain to get through with it!I won't buy other books from this author."
4,The Man Behind the Novels,"Originally titled ""Camus for Beginners"", this concise biography combines personal information, short excerpts, and vivid cartoons to illuminate the man behind the modern literary myth.Although I had read The Fall, The Plague, The Stranger, and a few collections of essays a decade earlier, I had only a vague memory of Camus' actual life and conflicts. This fine book, which I read in less than two hours, remains a solid primer. Both longtime admirers of Camus and undergraduate students forced to read his celebrated novels should find this brief work a valuable investment of time.It's also worth noting that cartoons are often read by adults in Europe. The format provides readers with a superficial, yet accessible and non-threathening, way to enter into academic and philosophical discussions. College and high school teachers of French, literature, and philosophy would benefit from adding this book to their students while assigning any novel by Camus."
4,Good Information,"The author of this book provides extensive information about how to balance your diet from a combined Western/Asian perspective, however, the book would be more useful if she had provided comprehensive summaries of the information. She does give short summaries of specific sections, but since a lot of the information applies to several aspects of a person, a quick reference summary of types of people and their corresponding needs/solutions would be helpful. You are going to have to compile this for yourself, and it will be time consuming. I do think she gives useful information here though, so I would recommend this book."
3,I had high hopes for this book,"I really hoped this book would have great information and help with my health. I read the reviews here before purchasing ""Live in the Balance"" but now I think most of them were not written by ""real"" people. According to the wet vs. dry, hot vs. cold quizzes in this book, I am both wet and dry, and hot and cold. It was all very confusing and vague. Don't get me wrong, there is some good information in this book and I think TCM is very helpful, but this one just wasn't for me."
1,Little Cafe Cakes,"This book is not written for an American audience. The measurements were European (i.e. grams and weights for ingredients). Sorry, call me lazy, but I just don't want to hassle with the conversions. Also, I'm not sure whose tastes these recipes might appeal to, but some of the recipes were pretty far out there as far as flavor combinations. In addition, the ingredients and tools needed are somewhat uncommon and hard to come by in everyday stores (by the way, I live in a fairly large city). Beautiful food photos. Nice to look at, but not a great cookbook."
5,Interesting inside info,"Mr. Kerby tells of many incidents during some of his active years with the FBI. He includes (true)happenings that really make it interesting. I attended the premiere of the movie Street Boss which recreates the 'capture' of Tony Jack (Giacolone), a Detroit mafia boss. Good movie, good book."
2,A dummies book...for dummies,"Sadly this thing only really covers Map making,with the title it has I would cry foul and demand your money back,unless you are focusing on maping."
1,worthless bike cover,very heavy easily torn--reinforcement non fucnctional--doubt i can cover my bike 10 times before it is torn to shreds--i would not reccomend it at all--wasted my money
1,"NEW, EASY-TO-TEAR, HEAVY DOO-DOO BIKE COVER!!!","TERRIBLE. OVERPRICED. EASILY TORN. WASTE OF MONEY.I picked up Sunlite's ""Heavy Duty Bike Cover"" at a local bike shop to protect my bike from the elements while chained on a city street. For Sunlite to claim that it is ""heavy duty"" is false advertising.It didn't last long. One wrong tug and a pedal ripped through this thin, easily-torn bike cover. Other rips followed, rendering the cover useless. Take your money elsewhere."
5,"The company sent me a statement 'if you cannot give us a 5 star rating, please contact us and we'll make it right'.","The order arrived to me four (4) days earlier by postal mail than the earliest estimated arrival date. I personally do not know what to expect about a bicycle storage cover. This cover is the third one I have ordered from Bike World USA, and the other two, which are outdoors all the time, eventually faded, developed small tears, and got brittle. I do not know if this is to be expected from a bicycle cover. Being able to order a bicycle cover at all from Amazon.com saved me, because I have limited transportation, and I do not know of a business local to me that even sells bicycle covers at all."
1,terrible bike cover,"This bike cover is quite heavy, but isextremely easily ripped. After using itonly one time, I had two large rips in it.Don't waste your money."
3,P Touch Labeler Tape,"I thought I'd save some money by gettting the 50' tape. What I got was 2 cartridges of the standard 26'. So, I actually got 2' more of tape, which is nice, for the price I paid. They really shouldn't advertise the 50' tape, unless that's what they're going to send, giving me the option of ordering 1 standard length for less money at the time. Glad I got the extra tape though."
1,"Very poor quality product, company won't honor warranty","I have been playing clarinet for over 30 years and was looking for a basic model slightly better than student grade.The first indication of a problem was that the mouthpiece chipped after less than a year (I play about twice a week and am careful with my instruments). I sent two requests to Suzuki for a replacement since it was still under warranty and got absolutely no response. After playing this model for about 4 years, I took it for repair to a local music shop (some of the keys were bent) and was told it wasn't even worth fixing. The tone was always very fuzzy, and it was very difficult using a reed thicker than #2 to play with. I am extremely disappointed with this product and will never again purchase this brand of clarinet. I agree with the technician's assessment: Suzuki makes good motorcycles and has a good piano program, but it stinks at making clarinets."
5,Super value,This clarinet plays as well as it looks. The case is very nice and the price is super too. You can't go wrong with this one.
2,You get what you pay for.,"I purchased this Clarinet for my child, as an alternative to the school rental Clarinet. I wasn't thrilled with paying $50 a month for a rental...and really didn't want to buy an $800 dollar Clarinet for a child that wasn't sure if he really wanted to play. I played and learned both instruments with my child, as extra incentive to help him stay interested.The produced arrive on time, and the build quality looked very similar to the more expensive rental. The sound quality was something else entirely.Even using the same reeds, this instrument needed more effort in order to achieve the same level of play. I was never quite as happy with the sound of this instrument as I was with the rental. For an 8 year old in beginning band, I decided that cheaper was still the way to go...or I probably would have returned the item. I really can't recommend this product."
1,A Word From A Band Director,"DO NOT BUY THIS INSTRUMENT FOR YOUR CHILD. After about a year of playing, the keys will bend and the instrument will become unplayable. It is cheaply made and if you read the discriptions of the instrument on their website- notice how much they talk about how pretty the case is. All that glitters is not gold!!! This is just very shiny junk in a flashy case.No band directors recommend these instruments, and repair shops refuse to work on them because you'd have to replace all the keys to fix it..You get what you pay for... a beginner clarinet should be about $600... getting this for $200 will wind up costing you a total of $800 when you have to buy another one after it breaks."
1,Not a well-built clarinet,"We bought this for my daughter for her first year band. She has played other musical instruments and generally good about caring for instruments. We had to take it to the music store twice for repairs during the course of the year (We did not have time to send it off for warrantee repairs due to the turnaround time.) Even after fixing, the clarinet did not make the same level of sound as a used Buffett student clarinet we decided to replace it with."
5,Non-greasy,"I have sensitive, acne prone, pale skin. This product did not make me break out and melted into my skin very easily. Protects well from sunburn and doesn't have that sunscreen smell."
2,Mixed Review,"Royall Bayrhum of Bermuda was NOT FROM BERMUDA AT ALL, but was concocted in the US under some kind of license agreement. I felt cheated when I read that on the delivery box. I am disappointed by this deception. The fragrance doesn't have the aroma of the original, made in the island. This is clearly a scam."
5,royal doulton bay rum,"Since Royal Doulton products are so difficult to find, I am always excited to find one and especially at a low price. Its a favorite of some of the men in my family."
5,Smells so good!,"I buy this for my husband ever year... and we still LOVE it! It smells so amazing! He always gets compliments on it, and it's not too overpowering. I'm super sensitive to smell (frangrances and/or colognes) and this one doesn't bother me at all! LOVE IT!!! (oh... and he does too!) ;-)"
4,Spicy aroma,"Refreshing and spicy aroma that's great as an aftershave or body splash. Does not overpower. May not be as long lasting as some but refreshing. But, remember, these types of products are subject to individual preferences."
1,May as well use water,"I recall the Bay Rhum I used in college - Royall Lyme brand I think (as opposed to Royal Doulton), but the Bay Rhum essence. It had a distinctive aroma that i could smell for close to an hour (others I suspect longer) but I think it was cologne, rather than ""after shave cologne"". In any event, the aroma of this stuff is so weak to my olfactory apparatus that I asked my wife what she thought of it. Her reply was ""barely detectable"". I think I'll stick to Tiffany for Men, Paloma Picasso's Minotaur, and Caron's Pour Homme in the future. To me, this stuff is no better than water. I may let half of the alcohol evaporate to see if the aroma gets any stronger. Otherwise, I'll simply toss it."
1,"If you like the smell of hairspray, this is for you","I like bay rum. Such a classic, clean scent. I have never run into a bay rum that I didn't like, until now. This stuff vaguely smells of bay run, then quickly degenerates into something resembling the smell of cheap hairspray. Truly awful. While most bay rums tend to be on the short-lived side, not this stuff, no, you'll reek of chemical waste all day (and then some).I wish I could give this zero stars."
1,money wasted,Just want to warn buyers not to buy from the bookgrove. I purchased Dinner for Two by Betty Crocker fromthem because they said it was a new copy. I passed up several other sellers who were selling used copiesand paid a lot more for my copy because it was listed as new. It is clearly not new. The cover is creasedit is worn and there is even someone's old recipe card stuck inside it. I didn't mind paying the extra moneyfor the copy because it was a gift. I thought I was buying a new copy as promised. I was ripped off. Beware.
5,A Children's Worker Must Have,This book goes throughout the entire Old Testament giving the worker simple activities to bring the Bible to life. Not all of the activities are great but there are plenty to make this book a must have for children's workers. We use it in children's church.
3,good supplement to stash,"These are a nice inexpensive supplement to the kissaluv's hybrid one size, which is more absorbent and has elasticized legs. As another reviewer stated, the sewn in liner tends to fold over during the wash, and stains do not come all the way out. They are a wonderful material, but I like the design of the hybrid one size better--the soaker is only sewn on one end, just below the waistline, they come totally clean in the wash and have elasticized legs to hold everything in."
2,Not what I wanted,"It was too thick, so I was worried for my new born to use it.It may give him a nappy rash.So I did not it use it."
2,not what i expected,"the contour diapers seem like a good idea, but like prefold diapers you still need an insert to keep your baby even remotely dry. Unfortuntely these diapers are so small, the insert doesn't quite fit right and sticks out a bitup top. This would still be okay, however my baby couldn't fit into the contours with or without an insert beyond 11 lbs. you can't believe the numbers 5-20lbs."
3,Is not available in 1-2 days,"When ordered, the customer servce says this is a specialty item and takes a couple of weeks. Paid for 10/11, anticipated ship date 10/26..."
5,A well written mystery in a wonderful series.,"Each novel in this series improves upon characterizations, plot lines, and overall suspense. In this installment, Mark Manning, the protagonist, has a much broader and more responsible role in both his personal relationship, his job, friends, and with his nephew Thad. The mystery plotline is stronger as well as Michael Craft incorporates red herrings and less obvious solutions than in some of his previous books. The title of the book was too big a give away to some of us who play ""Name games"" on a regular basis, but you still look forward to Mark Manning solving the crime. An enjoyable read, with only a few ""over the top"" characters."
5,Awesome Mystery,"This book was a total pleasure to read. This is the first one of the ""Mark Manning"" series that I've read. The murder story-line was very interesting. The mystery took a 'spin' on some gay male fantasies while keeping you guessing to ""who did it?"". Michael Craft then takes the story a step further by devoloping the main characters through day to day experiences outside of the mystery surrounding their lives. There are some very fun sub-characters also. Mark Manning and his partner Neil may not be experiencing what you or I have experienced in our life, but their thoughts and reactions to their personal life are honest and heartfelt. When I was finished, I was excited to know what would happen next in a addition to the series. Luckily for me, Michael Craft's new addition is now out, ""Boy Toy"". And I'm finding out how the characters are developing further. I'm hooked. I am now a fan of the Gay Mystery Genre. More importantly a fan of Michael Craft and his characters in ""Name Games""."
5,Photoshop can be fun afterall,This book is great. I have been struggling with Photoshop for months. I am happy to have finally found help.
5,Simpsons pin pal lunch box,This lunch box is sturdy and fun to have since we are bowlers and we are big fans of the simpsons
1,disappointed with the case.,"The overall condition of the case was fine, but the belt clip does not hold very good. For an active person or someone who works alot with their phone on their belt, it falls off all the time. The clip is not strong at all. Myself or my son will not use it any more for that reason."
5,a great read and excellent history,This book is very interesting and worthwhile. The parallel structure of a personal history juxtaposed against the backdrop of contemporary events in Europe bring a new perspective and a deeper understanding of WWII. This is worth your time.
4,We are all Dr. Skov's descendents.,"I had the honor of taking a class from Dr. Skov, on ""The Experience of War in 20th Century Europe"". ""Letter to my Descendents"" was one of our texts.I'll admit, there are memoirs of resistance activities that I consider to be more interesting and better written. However, Skov's biting, dark sense of humor, combined with his unassuming sense of arrogance, make for a unique read.For me, ""Letter"" drives home the fact that each and every one of us is capable of resistance. The question is, will be accept this in ourselves?"
2,Not Effective for wrenches,Priced great but you get what you pay for. The rack works well for screwdrivers & nut drivers but wrenches fall thru easily. We ended up having to get a separate rack for wrenches.
4,Great for what it needs to do!,"Which is to hold tools so you don't need to search through a tool box for a screwdriver or pliers. It's made out of plastic, but it's a bit too soft. Tools aren't meant for delicate holders like this, but it does hold them. So far everything is held in place and nothing has fallen, so it's holding up. For the price, it's unbeatable."
5,A Pop Classic,"I'm so happy to see that this has been rereleased and hope that it sells so that others can discover what a great talent Mitch Easter has at writing songs and playing guitar. Sure, REM can thank him for doing the knob-twiddling for their first 3 releases that set them apart in college radio, but Easter deserves credit for all of the work that Let's Active did as a band. They were fantastic live as well if you ever got the chance. If you like some of the quirkier indy bands that are popular these days you'll find a lot to like on ""Big Plans . . ."""
4,"It's great, but with one minor gripe...","I'm really happy that finally Naruto Shippuden is being released in Box Set format, and this Special Edition with the Mininja Naruto is great.I have one issue though.The original Naruto Box Sets were packaged in a Digipak set, where you pulled it out of the sleeve and opened it up to find the discs/inserts. This set is not like that. It's still a cardboard sleeve, but instead of the Digipak, it's 3 slim cases for each disc. A lot of people wouldn't have a problem with this, but it's just something I find irritating. Another disappointment is that no storyboard booklet is included either, sadly.Though if these minor problems, I still find this set great, and it's easily worth a purchase!"
5,Quick to box set....nice,"Surprised that with individual Shippuden Vol1 and Vol2 just out and Vol3 at the end of the month (Nov '09) its nice to see a 3 volume box set for release 2 months later in January '10. I thought we'd all have to wait a lot longer for a slightly more economical way to get our Naruto fix. With the original Naruto seems like they released all the individual DVD before they started on the 3 DVD boxes..I'm happy to see this box set for Shippuden so quickly. I'd fully expect this be exactly what you get in the individual volumes DVD wise - perhaps lacking some inserts with the individual DVD releases. So I'd fully expect the same English dub and Japanese w/English subs.Oh yes..review:Naruto is one of the best anime and Shippuden continues the story line 2.5 years (in Naruto time) after the final of the 50 or so enjoyable, but mostly filler Naruto episodes. Watch it."
3,"Great show, horrible price.","I love the original series of Naruto, and I love Shippudden, however, this price is ridiculous. There are multiple volumes already out, and to collect them all will murder my wallet. In region two (The UK) they released the COMPLETE season one set, which contains 52 episodes, and the COMPLETE season 2 which is another 50 episodes, much more bang for your buck. Amazon also did this with the original series. So until Amazon puts out completed seasons, I'm not wasting my money on this."
3,A welcome return to Naruto... with somewhat poor video quality,"I really enjoy Naruto and its a blast to finally see the new series hit US shores. I didn't mind the filler episodes finishing off the original series, but they do get old after a while when the story just sits at a stand-still. I would give the dvd set a five star rating except for one big issue. The video quality of the transfers is very poor in my opinion. No, I did not buy a bootleg. Its straignt from amazon.com. I have an HD tv and I play many standard anime dvds upconverted on it but this one has very washed out colors. It may be best to wait for the eventual blu-ray release of the series (no official word yet but I believe its coming). I really feel they could have done a better job. Even the old Naruto looks better than this in terms of color."
2,Not very good,"I've just finished the first four sets, and I'm not impressed at all. It tells you that Naruto has just gotten back after training for 2 1/2 years with Jiraiya and has a lot of new skills to show off, but really he hasn't learned anything and is no stronger than before. He is also still is really ignoring and impatient as before and the show lingers on and on waisting as much time as possible to make the show even longer."
3,English Dubbed????,I gave it a 3 star because it is listed a only being in Japanese with English subtitles. Is it Dubbed and the listing is wrong? Also how many episodes is in the box set. Amazon please make the listing more clear. I can't see why it is not dubbed and the minutes say 100 mins but the other Naruto box sets were 375 minutes that is almost 4 times as long. Is this listing correct?
2,Is it dubbed?,I only want to know if the Box Set is dubbed in english or not. I know 4 volumes have been made english dubbed so the first box set should be aswell. If it is made known on this page that it is english dubbed i will definetly purchase it via amazon.
4,We all love Naruto!,"Watching it now and so far it works. I'm always hesitant about these things. So far, so good."
3,dangerous food glide handel,"The slicer slices ok, but the food glide handle comes up and off too easily. I have to take one hand and hold the food glide handle down while trying to glide the food thru to the blade. Is this the correct handle for this slicer. FS150 model #. I have used food slicers before and never had this problem. I am almost afraid to use it.I hate to return an item and do not like to complain, but I think this is worth looking into before someone puts their hand into the blade."
1,This slicer is not food safe,"As stated in the title, this slicer is not food safe. Without tools like bottle brushes it is impossible to get some areas cleaned of fat/meat residue. It's a Listeria time-bomb. The internal areas behind the blade have ridges, edges and corners that build up debris. The meat holder slide is a tube around a tube and cannot be cleaned. The last time I used it I spent a bit less than two hours cleaning it before reassembling it and putting it away (surfactant, quaternary ammonia, sodium hypochlorite). Before Christmas I got it out to conquer a salami but decided to unscrew the blade just to check. It went in the trash so someone at the recycle center wouldn't pull it out for Goodwill. The salami was sliced with a knife. I should have swabbed it first for plate counts, but didn't think of it at the time. Seriously, look at how easily the slicer can be cleaned before you buy."
3,Good at first,"I had this slicer for several years and would bring it out to slice meat and cheese. When I first got it, I was very happy. After a while it seemed like it just was not holding up. The plastic piece that holds the food and protects your fingers, just didn't hold as well as it should. The food was contantly rotating out of the cutting area when it hit the blade. The worst part was it seemed the carriage lost some integrity. After a while the plastic upright part of the carrige that pushes the food through the blade started hitting the blade itself. Next thing you know I'm slicing the plastic carriage assy. This was good starter slicer especially for the price. I am now looking to upgrade."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"I have bought several brands of slices and this has to be the biggest piece of junk I ever used. Right out of the box it barely worked. Gears would seize up with little use. I haven't even had it a year and I threw it in the garbage after paying over $150 for it. The gear completely is froze up. GARBAGE! The are still selling them too, very disgusted in waring pro products. Never would buy another."
2,It's a dangerous machine,"I wanted to like this but after much use, I will say that it's a dangerous device for the following reasons:1. The suction feet slide during use [esp. if you are slicing meats and there is fat involved]2. The handle/guide comes off too easily.3. There is no finger protection on the top right end of the machine.Put those three elements together and you now have a recipe for slippery, bloody slicing experience. I never use this with people and kids in the house. They've got to redesign this thing. Good-luck."
2,simple not a good unit,Suction cup feet dont work on any surface..Plastic handle not safe at all..Crome shaft that handle glides on sticks< must oil too make it work right... Motor slow .. been useing meat slicers over 3 years> and cant a even slice with this unit no matter what i do> will be returning this one sorry folks....
2,waring pro slicer is a waist of money,"I had a FS-150 for a long time and worked ok until the gears gave in, now I have the new remodeled FS-155 which is a piece of junk, don't waist your money on it."
5,"Much more than ""Morning Meetings""","This excellent book was a great resource for me on a recent trip to China where I taught ESL. As an ex-lawyer with little teaching experience I found it invaluable for many things--the importance of greeting each child by name, making sure the students know each others' names, ideas for quick interactive games to pick up the pace. There's a lot of material I found a little theoretical and not helpful for my specific needs, like the chapter on the ""Circle of Power and Respect."" But the appendices are chock full of concrete ideas for the classroom. The many illustrations of charts for the news and other exercises were clear and very helpful in envisioning exactly how to execute an idea. This book was recommended by the sponsor of the ESL program I participated in, and I found it well worth the money."
5,Best Book,"This is an awesome book to help build a sense of community in your classroom. The kids love the greetings and games, but best of all they are starting to lead the morning meetings themselves. Working in a low income area I didn't think the meetings would work, however the kids are starting to show more respect towards each other and learn how to greet visitors. I highly recommend this book for ANY classroom."
4,Morning Meeting,This book was recommended to help children to learn about each other and to get along better. I hope to utilize many of the ideas during this school year.
5,Instructional study,"Celia Brewer is also the author of A GUIDE THROUGH THE OLD TESTAMENT. Both are excellent resources for lay leaders leading group discussions. Not too lengthy, however, thoughtful discussion questions follow each chapter."
5,Takes the Think out of planning a party,"I love her book because she thought of everything so you don't have to reinvent the wheel. She has menus for parties of 25 and 50 guests so you know how much and step by step instructions on how to organize it, cook it and present it. Great book if you entertain and want an easy process!"
4,Best Martha Stewart!,"I've had this book since it first came out. It is my Go-To book when I'm throwing a party. The pictures are beautiful and the menus give good ideas even though I usually do simpler versions of them from other books. I've never been disappointed with anything I've made though, and her presentations are inspiring. It's really best for menu ideas, such as what to include in a Thanksgiving dinner, and how many items to include for parties of various sizes.I'm a big fan of her dessert recipes and make them regularly. Favorites include Pear Almond Tart (gorgeous, delicious and easy to make), Apple Tart Normande and the Kiwi Tartlets - which I've made as a full sized tart. All much easier to make than you'd think."
5,Inspiration for bored homemakers,"This book is a staple in my kitchen. Do I cook all the upscale, gourmet recipes? I'd love to say yes, but in all honesty I haven't the time! I *have* tried the sugar cookies, and they went over well with my three little boys! The reason I love this book is that I can read a bit, look at the lovely pictures, and gain fresh inspiration to make my little home a lovelier place. Also, for any Martha-phile, this book is a good place to peek inside Martha's life and hear her thoughts for more than just a five minute segment on her show."
1,A dreadful book by a dreadful woman,I used this book for a lavish party at my home and the results were terrible. Save your money!
2,"Two ""different"" but ""the same"" clocks.","There are at least two different production runs of ths hard-to-find alarm clock out there.

The ones that say ""Quartz Alarm Radio Controlled"" (the earlier run) receive the WWVB time signal with no problems. The ""Sonnet"" clocks are a later run."

1,Worst toy ever - stay away,"My son received this toy as a gift from his grandmother for Christmas. She did not realize the action figures were not included. It is just a big plastic boat that requires batteries to do nothing. Looks cool on the box because you think you are receiving a cool pirate toy - not a hunk of cheap plastic. Speaking of cheap plastic, the plastic chipped in two places when we were putting it together. Really poorly made. Stay away from this one - ours is heading into the trash."
1,Figures NOT included,"In very, very tiny print on the box, it says ""Figures not included"". Huh? Wha? I bought this item at the store, and never saw it until I opened the box and discovered the problem....and then I couldn't find any figures! Complete ripoff, unless you already have the figures.Too bad, looks like it could be a fun toy!"
2,Doesn't last as long as I expected,This is the second time I will be replacing my light bulb. These light bulbs last about 3 months and no longer. It seems to work fine for my Bonsai tree...
3,Bulbs are Expensive for 3 Month Life,"These bulbs claim to be 10,000 hours, which means they should last over a year if they were left on all the time. However, everyone seems to agree they last only three months on the Intelligent Plant Light. My advice is to google ""9 Watt 4 Pin 2G7 base fluorescent bulb"". If you get a choice select 4100 kelvin. I am trying a name brand this time to see if I get better lifetime on the bulb."
2,Disappointed,I am disappointed because it does not seem to be working properly. It flickers and seems to be at half power.
4,Works OK,"After looking around, I found an alternative source that gives you some idea about the correct price for these tubes.[...]It is a little worrying that the tube is not a little brighter and a little longer lasting, but it works OK for orchids, some flowers, and for things that will fit."
2,Intelligent Plant Light Bulb,"I bought thsi plant light bulb from Amazon.com because it looked like and it said it was the replacement for my plant light. It was the same size, but the prongs did not fit into my light."
1,I had to change away from this product,"At first I was able to keep three small plant lights with these bulbs going, but after I moved I was never able to keep them working. I tried many times replacing the bulbs etc... I am now using a small Sun System HID light and I am much happier."
1,light bulbs are irrelevant if fixture doesn't work,Light fixture went out one week after it was gifted to a friend. He replaced with replacement bulb and it wouldn't work regardless of setting. He threw it in the trash and I feel like my money was wasted.Glentronics PL-1 Intelligent Plant Light
5,Utterly Amazing,"I've just finished reading this book, and I commend the author for whatever patience, fortitude, compassion, and courage it must have taken to write this most fascinating - and often painful - account of this couple's tragic, unspeakable loss. I've never read anything quite like this before, as it looks at grief from such a unique, thorough, intimate, and extremely honest perspective - through the eyes of both a mother and father experiencing and transcending the loss of both a daugther and a son. I think these parents have a lot to teach us - not only other bereaved parents, but also those who work in the field of bereavement. I won't hesitate to recommend it highly."
1,"Ad says 50, you get 1. RIP OFF!!!!!","I have to say I was expecting this to happen, it jsut sound to be to good of a deal, but I thought I'd try it any way. After getting just 1 disc, I called and spoke with a rude customer service who was unwilling to admit a mistake, and did not want to help me at all. I hope this company is either taken off Amazon or can at least switch to advertising the real product!!!!"
5,Timeless pieces,The Johnson Brothers Regency is timeless. I have had my original pieces for 26 years and they still look wonderful.
2,Haynes Xtreme Custonizing Full-Size Ford Pick-ups,"While the book has some good information in it if it wasn't for some of the pages being stuck together with spray paint it would be great. The description says ""new"" but oviously is not new! For the price I payed I would have been satisified if the pages were all readable."
1,DO NOT BUY - Out of Date Item,While the price was terrific......and the kitty gift treat bag looked wonderful.THE FOOD PRODUCT WITHIN WAS OUT OF DATE BY OVER A YEAR!What were they thinking? Surely there should be some rule about expired food items being sold online.I will not buy another food product via Amazon or anything by SassafrasThe only reason that it was given one 'star' is that the system would not allow a post up without that area being used.
3,Christmas,"These cat treats are a Christmas present for 1 of my dtrs. to make for her cat Boo,so I won't know 'til after the holiday !"
2,Joe Celko's Trees and Hierarchies in SQL for Smarties,"It's not what I expected.I'm doing alot of SQL programming now and there's also alot of self-joins and just simply alot of analytics in my new position using SQL. I thought this book would help me in this area but was wrong.If you have computer science background think of this book as trying to do binary trees and linked lists in one table. It uses one table fields to try to get to the left and right nodes and back to the root node. Don't get me wrong, if this is what you need to do then this book is right for you. However, if you want to do real life advanced application programming using SQL to get your job done I would highly recommend to review other books. Sincerely, JP"
4,The best for Turcophiles!,"Beautifully written, although she does make a couple of historical boo boos, she loves Turkey so much, all of her fans will forgive.Add this one to your collection and you'll read it more than once, I promise."
1,Bias towards the Turkish denial of their past,"The book has many inaccuraticies. The Kurds are called ""Mountain Turks"". Eventhough they lived thousands in Kurdistan. The Turks are recent invaders who since the 1000's have slowly taken over all over Asia Minor. The Armenian village that the author says that proves that the Turks did not commit genocide was not in Turkey during the genocide. It was part of Syria until 1940's. Lucky for the Armenians that Russia had part of Armenia or there would be no Armenia today. All together three million people were killed in the genocide which included Armenians, Greeks, and Assyrians. There is Assyrian monastery the Turkish government is trying to take over right now."
2,Turkish Reflections: A Biography of a Place,This is a personal musing written in a diary format. Very disappointing read. Lacks depth on every level. I would return it if I could.
4,"""Aren't You a Little Short for a Stormtrooper?""","Not *quite* as fun(ny) as Darth Tater and not nearly menacing enough to pull off the stormtrooper. Darth Tater has a lightsaber, this guy holds a potato masher for gosh sakes.It's still funny and it now sits on my desk at work - while Darth has moved up into display mode. They'll work nicely together.Availability doesn't seem to be an issue....yet. Whereas just this week I got an email notice from Amazon that Darth Taters are now available (I asked for notification in April!), I received my Spudtrooper three days after ordering here. Either the thrill has gone or no one yet knows these are out on the market (I saw no signs of these in the brick and mortar in the past few weeks)."
4,Watch out! He'll mash you!,"I have both spud trooper and darth tater and I almost perfer spud trooper. It might be because of my general affinity for storm troopers, or the fact that he weilds a laser masher (so funny), either way, I like him a lot. He does come with some other parts so you can mess around with his face a bit. Good collection piece, good for kids."
5,Mr.Potato Head Spud Trooper,This is one of the cutest Mr. Potato Heads ever made. My grandson loves him. A great addition to his collection.
4,"Once maneras de ""quitarse"" el sombrero",Aunque se extrañan las canciones escritas por Miguel este es un disco precioso. Hay que escucharlo varias veces para que empiece a gustarte. Mis canciones favoritas: El Amor después del Amor escrita por Fito Paez (que recomiendo escucharla a todo volumen) y La Belleza (Luis Eduardo Aute) que en la voz y estilo de Bosé son estupendas. En fin un album lleno de hermosos sonidos. Escúchalo.
5,"Ahora, jo soy el fan numero uno de Miguel!","This is a fantastic album. I live in San Diego and listen to Mexican radio to learn Spanish and began to feel ripped-off if I didn't catch a song from Miguel Bosé at least once every two days. Now I feel spoiled to be able to hear him at will. I plan to aquire the rest of his albums as soon as possible. Quelqu'un peut-il me dire où Miguel a appris son Franais? ""Ne me quitte pas"" m'est très émouvant, vraiment un album génial through and through."
5,"Domo, Seiko!","This is a great watch at a great price, and I like how the second hand moves steadily (similar to a Rolex) instead of ticking. I'm also pretty confident about the quality, because my boss has had her Seiko for years, and it still looks nice and works perfectly. Ladies, if you like the Rolex style but can think of much better uses for those thousands, this is the watch for you."
2,disappointed in the quality,This watch came in a VERY cheap box and the band was exceptionally cheap. It was the same kind of band that was on a fake Rolex my son bought from a street vendor in NYC.I returned the watch and my acct. was credited. I bought the same watch from Sam's Club and it was much nicer.
5,I love the Garlic Roaster,"I love the Garlic Roaster. I use it often because it is so easy to use and the garlic can be used so many different ways. I can spread it on bread and crackers or put it in mashed pototoes or soups. It is a great product. I bought one for my son, my daughter, My friend as a hostess gift and my sister, They all love it too."
4,This book got me through!,"Read some of the other reviews here and yes - this text has got quite a few errors in it.That's inevitable in a book this size.Most importantly, the subject matter is covered well and enough questions are given to make your memory work - or at least that's the way questions help me in my study efforts.I bought the New Riders books before and there's nothing in them, (well very little), which isn't here.Worse still when I first started my MCSE 'endeavour', I paid 1500+ for a course by a certain large education company which came nowhere near the usability and quality of this book.If this sounds like I'm a fan - then YES I AM.My only regret is spending money on other study aids - because they weren't necessary.Congratulations QUE - you have a winner - but you need to spend a bit more time proof reading in the future. Keep it up.Mark Hodgkinson - MCP - CNA"
1,An Incredible Book!,"This book has unbelievable quantities of mistakes and errors in it. It is just incredible to see Que(the publication company)could have such a lausy book published and sold at such a high price. I read about 35 pages and found more a dozen mistakes and errors and a lots of them existing with the answers. They are so obvious that I have to believe that it had not been carefully edited at all before sent to the printing house. This book is an easy book to test your ability of editing, though. It is a shame!"
3,Spend your time looking for errors,"This book is full of errors. Questions that have nothing to do with the answers, grammar errors, spelling, incorrect answers,etc... (and English is not my native language!!!). But the text summary part was worth it. I passed the exams but spent to much time trying to figure out the right answers. Perhaps that is why I passed the exams :-) SHAME ON THE PUBLISHERS!!!"
3,Excellent Second Book for your MCSE Self-Study Collection,"""Over 2000 Practice Questions!"" boasts the cover of this exam prep tool, which takes on all four of the core exams on the MCSE NT4 track. It's the 2000 practice questions that make this hefty paperback a worthwhile purchase. Questions at the end of each sub-section test your knowledge of the material just covered. And when you miss a question on something you've just read, you know immediately that this is a weak point for you. Also, each chapter has its own test, and there are two practice tests included for each of the four core MCSE exams. How you fare on these will tell you if you're ready for the real thing.Although an excellent compliment in the pursuit of a well-rounded set of self-study materials, this book should NOT be the only one you purchase. To pass each MCSE core exam on the first try, study using another book first, then use this one to refresh your knowledge and to see if you're ready to risk the $100 each test costs."
4,Summaries + Tons of Preparation Questions,"There a so many books out there to help you...my feeling is that this series is best used in conjunctin with a Reference-type Book: read thoroughly 1-2 times a Reference Book, then use this series to go over the subjects and answer all the questions...you'll be prepared.Yes indeed there are some errors, as some of the questions may have been rejected by Microsoft because they were presumed too ambivalent or outright wrong...but that accounts for no more than 8% of questions.Enrico Savorelli"
2,Should I ask for a refund - or show to Trading Standards?,"Initially, I thought of sending corrections to the publishers... but I retire in 30 years (a poor joke, but it represents my feelings about the book).I came to the conclusion that searching for the errors was the deliberate game plan of the authors.The worrying part is that there is a ""Microsoft Approved Study Guide"" badge on the cover.This book has taught me a valuble lesson."
3,Good for a quick and dirty review,If you have read a more extensive study guide like the Sybex series then this book is okay for last minute review. The questions are good if in need of a proof reader in some spots. If you know your stuff it shouldn't confuse you too much. I liked the layout of the contents which mirrors the exams nicely.
2,Beware the *many* errors in this book,"If you are looking for a book to help you study for the MCSE core exams, this book is of dubious value. Being an MCSE certified on NT 3.51, I wanted something that would give me a quick review to pass the 4.0 tests. The organization of the book is good, but the many errors I encountered have led me to say that I would never recommend this book. I did not find many errors in the actual text of the book, but when it came to the sample tests, look out. Repeated questions, answers to questions that weren't asked, questions about material not covered in the text, questions about non-existent menus. After a while, it got to where I couldn't trust what the book was saying - not very valuable as a review tool."
4,This could be 5 stars,"I bought this for a xmas gift. The recipient loved the neck wrap with the exception of the packet of lavendar packet that is included. Otherwise, the product would have been given a 5 star rating. The service from the vendor was prompt."
5,What's in a Name?,"I grew up in Winston-Salem, so Let's Active were hometown heroes of mine. From what I've heard, and choose to believe, the name Let's Active comes from a mis-translation of ""Let's Get Physical,"" seen (presumably by a member of the band) on a Japanese t-shirt written ""Let's Active."" So the band name, like the music it produced, is genius. This was their swan song and is probably their most ""rock"" album. ""Big Plans. .."" should have been their first commercial success and this should have been their ""sell-out"" follow-up. And maybe in some alternate (better) universe, it was. If you want to learn where a whole bunch of today's hip bands were weened, check out Let's Active. It may take a few listens to get into Mitch Easter's unique (original) vocal stylings, but you cannot deny the rock."
1,Scandous price for scanty information,"This is hardly a biography. It is a sketchy outline of incomplete bibliographical information with the barest facts about Carlos Monsivais's life that are available on Wikipedia (and in more complete form, absolutely free). The purveyors of this biographical ""entry"" should be ashamed for luring interested clients into paying nearly $10 for a page of almost useless information."
3,"21 Tracks, one winner.","While the track I bought the album for (#2 Played-A-Live (The Bongo Song was a great addition to my personal compilation, the rest of the tracks just didn't have the same soul. Buy the track if you can and save some coin."
4,Comfortable & gorgeous sandal if you can get the right size,"I agree with the first reviewer that sizing runs way small, and one should order a size and half larger than your usual. I usually wear size 7 and returned them for an 8. I'm keeping the size 8 but if I were to reorder I'd choose 8 1/2 so my heel doesn't have any chance of hanging off the back edge. These sandals are nicely cushioned and the center ornament is gorgeous. I have the rose metallic and love the color. These are quality sandals if you can get the right size."
5,Great for late season garden/yard work,"I got one of these for the wife for when she's out tending the garden late in the year. She always complained about her hands freezing and bothering her. Not any more. I bought the red one for her and she wanted black so we ended up purchasing another. I now keep the red one for those fall football games, cookouts, etc. Couldn't be happier with them."
3,hand warmer,the only thing wrong with this product is that the clip kept getting stuck and it felt as if i was going to break it when i would try to adjust is
3,"Good vacuum, attachments wand difficult to use","Thought I would try a Dyson after seeing all the commercials about it never losing suction. The upright did a great job on the carpet and picked up all kinds of stuff; but then I tried the attachments. It was so inconvenient that it was the determining factor in returning the item. Yeah, it did a great job vacuuming, but so did my former vacuum when it was new and I thought the price I paid was not worth it. I expected a better ""user friendly"" machine for the pricetag."
5,Great!,"I have been very pleased with my factory-reconditioned Animal. It performs better than any other vacuum I've owned in the past. Unlike some of the other reviewers, mine looked brand new when I received it. Further, I haven't had a bit of trouble with the attachments, and I don't find the weight or size to be a problem. I can recommend the reconditioned model without reservation. It's quite a value over the new model."
5,thank goodness I was prepared,"okay got the Dyson DC14 Animal upright, put it together in the hallway on a tile floor...turned it on...vacuumed a path for about 8 feet long..looked clean before I started... I have 2 cats but picked up enough fur to make another two. I'ver read reviews and have researched Dyson so I was prepared for quality but I am still pleasantly surprised. Don't waste your hard earned money on any other brand. been there done that. not any more. Dyson is now my only option."
5,What can I say?,"Simply put, it's the best vacuum ever! Everything about it is perfect, super strong suction, awesome attachments and the way it extends is ""near"" perfect.About the only thing I can think of that I'd like to see different is adding a height adjustment for carpets. In my bedroom I have very thick carpet and in my other bedrooms it's thin. On my master bedroom carpet it tends to leave lines. I usually like lines as it shows you just vacuumed, but this leaves about 4 lines instead of the usual two corner lines.I was completely amazed when I saw how much dirt, dust and dog hair I got out of my carpet, even AFTER going over it with my old vacuum. I was expecting it to be the best vacuum I have ever used and it is."
5,Supurb Design,Head and shoulders above any vacuum I have ever used. The price is substantial (I paid $500 for mine at Home Depot). Like the reviewer above I had always bought more economical Hoover models in the $125 dollar range. My wife and I purchased one of these on impulse when we were flush. The machine has continued to impressed me for the eighteen months we have owned it. It is simple and powerful. It catches much more dirt (Evidenced by the fact you always have to empty the collection chamber). It is easy to use and easy to empty. It is painful to spend that kind of dough on a vacuum but it will likely save your carpet far beyond the cost of the vac.
1,broken vacuum,the vacuum was returned by a prior customer who still had there letter in the shipping container. it was obvious that the vacuum has not been repaired. we had to send the vacuum back to dyson twice to finally get it to run and repair the broken parts. we spent a lot on shipment. it was bought for a gift so that made it even worse.buddy white
1,BE CAREFUL !!!,"i have this vacuum...it is very very powerful and does not have a height setting....your delicate oriental or older carpets will be damaged if you use this vacuum with the beater bar engaged. If the beater bar is not engaged, all you are getting is suction and it simply does not clean well because it is a hard wood floor setting. This vacuum badly damaged my gorgeous oriental rugs !!"
1,"don't, don't, don't","The so-called ""factory reconditioned"" DC-14 was not at all what I expected. Pretty much just thrown into the box with the attachments. The unit would not function properly or even stand upright. It just kept falling over. Nor would it even pick up the lightest dirt. Most certainly not reconditioned! Do not buy one !!!!"
1,Compare before you waste your money!,"I was excited as most people to get my Dyson. All the reviews I had read had me convinced this was a top of the line vacuum. I had to do a lot of convincing of my husband to even consider spending this much on a vacuum. I assured him that the money was being spent well.The same day I was to receive my Dyson I had a Kirby vacuum demonstration done in my home. After about three hours of comparing the Dyson to the Kirby, the Kirby blew the Dyson out of the water. It was so frustrating to believe so much in a vacuum, only to have it thrown in my face. My husband was very unhappy that the promises I made didn't come through.I'm not here to sell you on a Kirby (which I did end up buying to replace my Dyson), but please compare before you buy. When you are spending this much money you want to get what you're paying for. The Dyson just didn't stack up when put to the test! FYI - I bought a Kirby Sentria (you won't believe it!)"
2,Missing parts made me nervouse,"I was very excited to purchase my 1st Dyson. I read the reviews online and decided to try and save a few dollars by going with the ""refurbished"" model. I was so excited and it arrived so quickly. Amazon really did a great job with that. But when I went to put the product together it was missing the 2nd most major part- the stick- with power you use to push a vacuum. Pretty importatnt part to be over looked. It made me nervous in regards to the quality of the machine if they can't even get the 2nd largest most imporatant part back in the box. The warranty on the refurbs are only 6 months and I figure if they do not do a good job checking that they packaged up the machine correctly. They may not do a very good job fixing them either.So I have returned it to Amazon- who like always was great."
1,Very Inferior Product - Save Your Money!!,"The first month or so that I had this machine, I thought it was great, like the other reviewers at this site. But performance quickly deteriorated. It stopped working completely after having it less than a year, however the warranty is only good for 6 months. It was a struggle to find a repair facilty, and when I did find one in a neighboring county I was told that the Dysons in their experience do not hold up. They have dozens coming into the shop every week, almost all needing the clutch repaired...an expensive repair... you could buy a new Hoover or Eureka for what it costs to repair the Dyson, and who knows how long the repair will even last.BASICALLY, IT'S AN EXPENSIVE PIECE OF JUNK!! Save your money!!"
4,Needed to replace brush bar and clutch,"I wanted to love this vacuum. I really did. It has a GREAT design, but it needs some work. It worked well for the first 6 times, then the brush bar got stuck with pet hair. It was impossible to clean.Within a month of buying it, I had to replace the brush bar and the clutch. Luckily, the Dyson warranty covered it and their service was excellent!!!So if you truly have pet hair, be forewarned that you will have to clean the brush bar EVERY time you use the vacuum. Also, the bagless canister is rather small. I have to dump it out at least 2-3 times every time I vacuum."
5,Dyson DC14 Animal Upright Vacuum,I couldn't be happier with this vacuum. My carpets and hard floors are so clean! This workhorse does NOT clog even with two dogs who shed all the time. It is such a pleasure to use.
4,"Great vacuum, most of the time.",I love the suction and ability of this vacuum on our carpet and most of the rugs. Our animals just trash the carpets with muddy paws and shedding hair. The stair attachment is disappointing and I prefer our old vacuum of the stairs. The Dyson makes a horrible noise if it sucks a snag out of the rugs or if the nose of the vacuum hits something and pushed down. The extention hose is good but I prefer our old vacuum of that too. I guess the ease/use of our old vacuum doesn't measure up to the performance of the Dyson so it's worth the sacrifice after all is said and done.
5,Suction of the gods !!,"I had heard about the incredible suction of this device... but words cannot do it justice. Any vacuum cleaner can pick up dirty, but for the dirtiest of situations, you need this product (no I really mean you NEEED this thing). The hose assembly is very sturdy with many ways to hold it when you're getting it into tight spaces at odd angles. The commercials say that it never loses suction, and I'm here to tell you cowboy: it never loses one single iota of its wonderful suction.My only regrets:1- I wish it had a few more special attachments for the hose2- I wish I still had blue cross (this thing NEVER loses suction)"
2,Dyson Animal,"When received - Item was thrown in the box, nothing secure. Item too heavy - not at all a pleasure to use. Very unsatisfied with Dyson. Will not buy one again."
3,Dyson 14,"I purchased a reconditioned Dyson 14 because we have 4 dogs. I was amazed at the power and amazed at how much lint and hair the Dyson picked up, even though I thought my carpets were fully vacuumed just a couple of days prior. If just normal upright use without using the attachments and the extension hose is all you want, you won't be sorry.I'd recommend testing it out, though, if the 17' extension hose is a high priority for you. The hose doesn't seem to loosen up, the upright falls over when I use the hose extension, the attachments don't ""snap in"" easily and sometimes just fall off. Maybe if you use the hose for a long period of weeks it will loosen up, but I'm tired of the upright falling over on the floor and following me around on its side. I've given up on the extension hose and have begun to attach my old stairway hose to it instead."
4,"Very pleased with ""The Animal""","First let me say that I would challenge anyone to tell the difference between the ""factory-reconditioned"" unit and a brand-spanking new one...so save the $200. Lighter and quieter than the Hoover it replaces, the Dyson DC14 seems to do the job well, and, believe me, it gets a workout. Horses, dogs and cats plus the dirt and debris from the barn and property really put it to the test. It's easy to use, very easy to clean, and comes with a host of attachments. So far I'm very pleased.Even reconditioned the Dyson is on the expensive side, so I only gave it 4 stars. A year from now if it's still working as well as it is today I'll revised my rating to 5 stars."
5,Best in vacuums,"We've owned a dyson (animal) for about 3 years now and if this ever breaksdown, we will definitly buy another. We have 3 dogs, 3 shedding dogs! I was going crazy with other vacs, I ended up with a separate hand vacs for the furniture as the floor vac just didn't help there. Not with the dyson, it does it all equally well. Easy to use, easy to convert to a hand vac, easy, easy, easy to empty. Can you tell we love this vac? We've owned at least 4 different vacuum brands, Dyson is the best."
3,"Ok, not great","We had a Dyson that was stolen recently from our garage and rather than pay full price (again) we opted for the reconditioned one but it doesn't work as well. It is still an ok vacuum, but not great."
4,What a great vacuum,This is by far the best vacuum I've ever owned. It does all it claims to do and more...So glad I have it!!!
4,Great!,I bought it refurbished.Not only is it a good deal but it is also a great product.It is quite big so it is hard to vacuum under furniture. Despite that it is a purchase I recommend.
3,its alright,a must if you own a dog who sheds like me. really cleans like no other vacum. but im not sure about the never loses suction part mine seems to be slipping already
5,"Looks New, Works Great","I bought a reconditioned DC14 Animal Vacuum and it looks new. I haven't tried all the attachments yet, but so far no complaints. I don't dread vacuuming anymore and it does a great job."
5,one of the prettiest,I think its one of the prettiest patterns that they make. I'm happy with my purchase
4,WOW,"I think some of the reviews are a little biased... not the book. I have seen a documentary on this event and read one other book. The other book was WAY more about prison politics than the actual riot. And being as this book was written from the mouth of an inmate (a writer wrote the book, not the actual man telling the story) you should expect him to say the things he say against the prison system. Buy his accounts of the riot are pretty vivid and disturbing. Plus I see that some people claim they believe he was ""making stuff up"" to make it sound worse. He wasn't. In the documentary I watched they interviewed a man that was one of the first people to enter the prison after the riots. The things he described are almost mirrored in this book. I think some people are going into this book with a biased opinion to start... and because the prisoner says things they don't agree with or believe.... they are calling him a liar. My question to them is.... Where you there? NO. He was."
3,Cry Me a River,"Besides the account of the 1980 riots that left 30+ inmates dead, it was a pity party for how bad it is in prison. Give me a freaking break. Here's an idea...don't break the law. I believe I can speak for many law abiding citizens in that you get what comes to you. I love that child rapers are despised. I like that the men in prison live in fear of rape or murder, because if they were on the streets we would be the ones in fear. So the prisoners take over, kill 30+ people to say that they deserve better conditions. That just doesn't seem like a very good argument. Prison is punishment. If you rehibilitate, great. If not, stay in there. I just can't fell sorry for murders, rapists, robbers and members of the Aryan Brotherhood. Tax money should be spent elsewhere."
4,very compatible fields,"The book sits at the intersection of two very fruitful areas of research - on genetic algorithms and on fuzzy logic. For the latter, you may want to note that one of the editors, Zadeh, is world renowned as its inventor.Naturally, the technical background of the book is very strong. The text demonstrates that the two fields are very compatible. Effectively, the use of one can reinforce the other in efficacy.The only ""problem"" with the book is its advanced nature. Ideally, you should already be experienced in at least one of these fields. If you are new to both, then consider boning up on another text first."
4,"fast and functional, yes, but fun?","This two cassets are useful, especially if you already know some Spanish (it is better if you know some basic verb forms, for example).However, I use Vocabulearn only when I am getting ready for bed, I found it a bit monotonous. And those sharp sounds between the sections! I don't see why they were necessary.Also, I would like to add that the listener has to pay attention to the words, otherwise they just go into one ear and come out of the other. I naively expected them to just stay with me."
5,Ahh Ronnie....,"What can I say. I miss Ronnie, and every time you have a chance to hear his work.......do....."
5,CAN'T PUT IT DOWN,"I picked up this book one afternoon at a book store and couldn't put it down until I had finished it that night. Coming from a German background myself, I found Auslander extremely spellbinding. You don't, however, need to be German to feel the sense of family and understand the changes that a family goes through with each new generation. The fact that Mary Powell told her story through the voices of her characters made the reader feel as if she were reading diary entries of the four women in the book. It made the book more personal and insightful. If I had to compare Powell's style to a modern novelist, I would say she's right up there with Barbara Kingsolver."
1,CHECK SHIPPING RATES BEFORE YOU BUY!,"The item itself looks wonderful, but frankly, I didn't order a wreath box--on sale at $18.88, normally more like $25 or $30--because the shipping was listed at almost EIGHTY DOLLARS. Yes, that's eight-zero dollars. I even called the Ace Hardware customer service line to see if it was a mistake--the woman didn't look anything up, but said in a rather bored manner and a foreign accent (I had to ask her 2ce to repeat herself), ""That's because it would come by UPS and in a big box--an ""oversized"" delivery."" I'm sure it's a great product if you can find it in an Ace Hardware store, but for that much money, I'll store my wreath in a clean, large trash bag and hang it on a nail in my storage cage. Sheesh."
2,latch doesn't hold well,"I bought it at Walmart, exact same one, for $9.00. The latch hardly keeps the container closed. It is very loose and the container falls open when moved. I am returning it. I'm amazed at the price of this item here. Way too expensive for what you get."
3,"Too, much money","I always do my research to see if the same product is cheaper elsewhere.well, i purchased this at kmart 2 days ago for $11.99, and it is a wonderful product and keeps your wreaths from being crush.i can't understand why it is so expensive here, even if they were selling just one."
