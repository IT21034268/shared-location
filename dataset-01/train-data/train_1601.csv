3,Midnight Music...missing something.,"I loved the movie and loved the soundtrack. The Anne Rice fan in me was happily pleased at the movie (but it doesn't compare to the depth of the book), and the movie lover in me was intrigued by the cinematography. When I bought the soundrack I was pleased but the music lover in me was let down just a bit. I was distrubed that some of the beautiful piano music sampled by movie was not included in the soundtrack (e.g. The rotting Lestat's piece). I was also thrown off by some of the uneven transitions between tracks.A good soundtrack, but I have heard better."
3,"Good cd, nice listening","I liked the cd, much more than Id expected, i mean, Im a HUGE gnr fan, thus why i listened to the cd, but was pleasently suprised with the other tracks, so, if you cnat decide on an album, but want to be sure your be pleased, if only a bit, then this is the cd"
3,Like the movie itself,"The last track ""Sympathy For The Devil"" from Guns and Roses is a mind bending performance."
5,Absolutely gorgeous!,"""Born to Darkness"" is the most beautiful theme you will ever have heard. At the same time it is so terribly sad and that makes the piece so fascinating.The whole atmosphere of the story and the setting is reflected in the music and the mood it creates.If you have watched the film several times and then listen to this album, you really see it again before your eyes.Listen to it in a dark room and you might even be scared, funny as it sounds!The Guns'n'Roses one may not be missing, of course. Being placed at the end it serves as a kind of relief from the grieving but yet inspiring mood the orchestral music conveys.This one's for lovers of classical music as well as those who like somber and austere art."
1,not a long lasting pickle,"Bought this charm for my daughter, it lasted one day before a trip to the jeweler, then a day after the trip to the jeweler the top sheared off so there is no ring to attach it to the bracelet. I paid for expedited shipping to make sure it was here a few days before the big day, and the day before the big day I was sweating till it arrived. Not a happy camper, the service was sub par and the charm itself left me frustrated and my daughter without a charm."
2,Didn't get it,"With the possible exception of the title track,I don't hear any ""songs"" here.They're interesting reflections on Bill Evans' style,but I just hear a lot of beautiful chords arbitrarily strung together.For me,this describes a lot of jazz,where the solos are pyrotechnically dazzling,the sheer proficiency of the playing is stunning,but there lacks the core,the soul of the thing,which is the song.Mays' work with Metheny and his other solo albums(with the possible exception of ""Street Dreams"")are incredible,so there's no doubting his genius.I guess if something is both complex and elusive,a lotta people think it's art.Well,some of the time it's crap."
3,Anodyne Dreams,"With the critics unmoved by his second solo album, 'Sweet Dreams', Lyle waited four years before risking a third. Changing the band format yet again, this time he went for a more straight-ahead, classic line-up -- piano, bass and drums -- like Chick Corea's Trio or the Keith Jarrett 'Standards' group.But there the similarities end. This band had real potential, but in my view, they are badly let down by an album of unremarkable, unmemorable compositions. The critics were, if anything, even more unmoved by this album. Mays would leave an even larger interval before returning to the studio to record his fourth. But that was to be an absolute stormer ..."
4,Great! Handy! Not happy about pink color!,"The complete item is very sturdy, handy and works really fine. I gave just 4 stars instead five. Out of all the colors (don't care if blue, green, clear, black, red) I received a PINK one! Argh!"
4,"Expensive, but good","First off, judging from the picture, I expected to receive three bottles and aprt of my order, but I only got one. It did everything a spray bottle should do. I used it when I was making my own shampoo that was really runny and required a spray bottle to apply. Although it was cheap, there are cheaper ones at the Dollar Store or wherever that I'm sure work just as great. If money isn't an issue, this is a great product. But if you're wanting to save a couple of bucks, I would look elsewhere."
4,Just what I needed - spray bottle with adjustable spray,"I was looking for a spray bottle that was adjustable - not with just a stream setting - and this was perfect for that. I'm using the bottle to spray my ivy plants so they don't get dusty, and the bottle is nice and small so it doesn't stand out when place amongst my plants. I saw that other reviewers didn't necessarily get a good color - mine was a purple top with translucent clear bottom (the translucency is from the surface being finely pebbled). My one complaint is that the bottle is somewhat difficult to screw shut - the threads are probably just not that great. However, it was cheap and it does 95% of what I wanted, so I would recommend this to you if you need a spray bottle!"
3,"Good Sprayer, Slighty Leaky","Ordered 3 of these bottles and received 2 in a hot pink color and 1 blue. Size was exactly what I was looking for (I was making some home-made yoga mat cleaner as gifts for a couple of fellow yogis). The sprayer felt like it was solidly constructed and would last for a while. Doing some test sprays produced a good range of spray area (focused stream versus wide spray). I knocked off 1-star because the sprayer head did leak slightly even after the nozzle was turned to the 'Off' position. I knocked the second star off because the bottle itself is a pretty flimsy plastic and also leaked when turned on its side - I believe the seal between the sprayer head and bottle wasn't quite perfect, allowing for some leakage. Overall though, for the price, these bottles were a good value and thankfully, my yogi friends loved the hot pink color."
1,Hinge broke after a week long usage,"The plastic quality of the spray top is not good enough, so the hinge broke after a week, and renders the bottle pretty much useless. While the hinge lasted it was working fine, and had it not broken I would have given this a 5 star."
1,really poor quality,"the straw broke while trying to wash it, that was before I even got a chance to try it. If I could rate it 0 stars, I would."
4,It does what it should...,"I needed a small water bottle to take with me to yoga, so I found this. I got a pink one. It works just fine and the only time it leaked was when I didn't completely twist the tip shut. But it's water, so it's no big deal. I've also found that it's great for wetting down short hair that is being temperamental and misting a cat that is also being temperamental."
2,Not color that is advertised in picture,"I understand the product says ""assorted colors"", but with Amazon, usually you get the color which is advertised in the photo. I was not expecting to receive a pink product. I wish the seller would allow you to choose the color, or at least see which one you were getting in advance."
3,Cute,cute and gets the job done. Just over priced lol you can get better at your local drug store. I did get cute colors tho!
3,Not HDPE Certified,"I must say, Im disappointed to find that this is not the one. Looks small, convienent, like not a drop of material will be wasted and Im sure thatll be the outcome. But in the end its not HDPE. The journey varied on."
4,Excellent spray bottle,"This is a very efficient little spray bottle. It shoots out a satisfyingly strong, straight spray. I was looking for more of a misting spray to water my indoor plant, but I am quite happy with this. Excellent value for money."
3,wrong color!!!!!!!!!! :(,"I got the spray bottle and it was fine , but it was the wrong color!!!! I wanted black!!!! but it came in this teal green color!!!"
3,More like a water gun than a spray bottle,"This spray has no spread at all. If a regular spray bottle was like a shotgun, this thing is like a sniper rifle. It should be marketed as a cheap water gun instead of a spray bottle. Also I don't think this thing is BPA free, but oh well."
5,Quality Squirt Bottle,"Pros:* Durable construction (Its been dropped too many times to count)* Spill Proof (It is laying on its side right now, and nothing is leaking out)* Long and Accurate Stream (especially good if you are using this as a cat deterent)* Mist function works great as well* Ergonomic GripCons:* Small Bottle SizeI purchased this spray bottle to spray my cats with water if they get on the counter. It has worked perfectly. The thing is completely accurate and I have absolutely no complaints. This bottle would also be great for someone that is watering plants or needs to mist something."
3,"Three Stars only (I would go for 2,5)","This is a documentary about the pianist.There are good details about the pieces, about how he sees the pieces.But the pieces are not complete.He is actually contradictory, but I guess this contradiction (as it is so obvious in the documentary)is on purpose. So we have a picture of the contradictory in the artist`s mind. Obviousness.I saw it twice (it was all I could stand...) aaaand straight to the shelf."
2,Not What it Seems,"The book is a small pamphlet like booklet. It is very technical; it goes through searches, free web pages, and designing a web page, not much about writing. Some helpful information about getting unpublished work seen."
5,Beautiful!,"Like all the Fiesta pieces that I have ordered from Amazon so far, this set arrived quickly and in excellent condition. The color is just beautiful and looks great with my cobalt blue plates!"
1,Forget it -- use Google!,"Somebody tell me why why WHY anyone with brain in his or her head would buy a BOOK in order to search for Websites about a certain topic. A BOOK! Think about it!Plus, Websites are by nature transitory -- they change all the time. Give me a break. ..."
1,Falls apart fast,What's scary about this BBQ brush is; when cleaning your grill the metal bristle come off. If your not careful it can get in your food and in you digestive track causing all kinds of problems.I threw mine away in the trash.
1,Will not buy from seller again,Item was not in condition described. It is an old library book in very used condition. I would not use this vendor again. Item went from the package to the trash.Very disappointed!
3,Preposterous,"The Water Thief is a tale very loosely related to the mystery surrounding the death of the Emperor Hadrian's young favorite, Antinou, who drowned in the Nile during Hadrian's visit to Egypt.The author, an Italian woman named Ben Pastor, bases her story on the highly unlikely premise that several centuries after Hadrian the Emperor Diocletian, suspecting a conspiracy still in existence, orders a Roman army officer to investigate Antinou's death. The novel revolves around and in part is told by the Roman officer, who makes occasional and slightly disconcerting use of modern American slang.The novel never gets around to providing a satisfactory explanation of Antinou's death, but the Roman eventually discovers a preposterous conspiracy. By that time the author has refashioned her story into what amounts to an old-fashioned romance in which the right people are eliminated and love triumphs."
1,Good If You Have Insomnia,"This book is unbelievably slow with a convoluted plot that meanders without purpose for huge stretches. The author spends so much time on unimportant details, whipping around names and places that she misses the entire essence and feel of the old Roman Empire. For a murder mystery there is no sense of urgency or tension, just slow, boring, plodding to the end."
5,Great album,"This is one of the best Fabric releases I`ve listened to. The way Carl Craig mixes r&b tunes with a 4/4 baseline is incredible. The only miss in this set is the vocals from Carl, they give the album a real live sound, but they just don`t sound right with the tunes."
3,Carl Craig shows that he still has the skills,"This is amazing stuff!Carl Craig mixing skills were great and this album is just a chillin'Really great I love this album.He mixes all type of genres in this album and I really respect that.Verdict: 3.0 out of 5.0 Great stuff! I was hooked on this. But for some reason I just don't want to give a 4 or a 5, even though this album is great I just don't."
3,Casual Entertainment,"This was interesting to watch in a casual way. The story makes for good entertainment. However, the production value is a bit low, so there are some annoying special effects that detract from the presentation."
5,The Heat Is On In Saigon!,"This is the most wonderful CD I have heard in a long time. Unfortunetely, I have never watched Miss Saigon live. The story of Miss Saigon is just wonderful and to put Lea Salonga in the role of ""Kim"" .... what can i say?! Also, Lea Salonga's voice and Simon Bowman's just combine so smoothly in ""The Last Night Of The World"" Lea Salonga's voice is just so magical! As in ""I'd Give My Life For You"", her voice becomes so powerful and in ""Sun and Moon"", she can sound really emotional and expressive. I reccomend this CD to any musical lovers because this CD will be at the top of your list of CDs!!"
5,LEA SOLONGA HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE AND DOES A GREAT JOB!,I LOVE LEA'S VOICE.IT'S ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VOICES I'VE EVER HEARD.I LOVED HER IN LES MISERABLES AND I LOVE HER IN MISS SAIGON.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SOUNDTRACK TO OTHERS.
4,Sound of Nature,"As being a musical-instrument maker, this book has been very useful to me especially in material selection. Most of musicians must be familiar with the information covered in."
4,Reader review,I have found this an excellent book for understanding some aspects of wood used in musical instrument making. It confirms many of the conclusions reached from practical experience. I just wish there was a little more that was relevant to instrument making.
4,A Very Complex Person,"This is a thorough retelling and discussion of a very complex person. Bosworth does a good job of drawing on interviews with people who knew Diane Arbus, and the reader does a get a vivid sense of what the burgeoning photography community was like in the 1960s. One concern I have is that this is very mucha re-telling of a life, not really an in-depth analysis. There is a certain lack of introspection about this, and the book fades off and becomes more episodic toward the end. I can't quite decide if that is intentional--an attempt to show a life coming apart at the seams--or just some final exaustion with the subject."
1,Diane Arbus: A Biography,"Great! Anyone who truly appreciates Arbus' photography and has been exposed to it (for example, the excellent show which the Metropolitan had a few years ago) will love this book. It was especially interesting to me since you really get an inside feel and idea of how Arbus composed and executed her photographs, and what prompted her to photograph her subjects. It also, of course, makes clear how deeply disturbed she was psychologically."
3,A little too ugly in a few areas,"Did author Bosworth have to make Mrs. Arbus out to be such a traitor to her Jewish kinfolk that Diane attended a 1930's american Nazi convention and heard the Nazi's making all those mean comments about Jews (Diane's only people mind you) and find the Nazi's interesting instead of appaling! No Bosworth didn't! And why did Bosworth have to point out about Diane's later alleged (sinful, unholy if truly) claim to have had sex with both a man a woman! It wasn't necessary! The rest of the book is mostly ok by me. Diane Arbus whereever you are God bless you and I hope you didn't really do all the things this book says you did."
4,Not bad,"A perfectly nice accent light, but it does not have the three-way touch switch other are touting. Just a plain old on/switch on the cord."
4,"Warm Glow, Great Looks","I bought this lamp to leave on overnight in my living room. It gives off a wonderful warm glow on the low setting, and the high setting is just bright enough but not glaring. Not meant for where you need good light to read or work by.This touch lamp does NOT work with a timer. Not a major drawback for most people, though!"
5,Great buy,"The lowest setting is a lovely nightlight glow, the brightest setting bright enough to comfortably light part of a room (though not bright enough to read by). Using several of these in a room throws a gorgous, flattering mica glow. Love the touch turn on, perfect for bedsides."
5,I love these shoes,I LOVE THESE SHOES!!! I just received mine today and I cannot wait to wear them. I bought them in a size 71/2 and they fit perfect. I am soo happy that I purchased the gold color... the color is real vibrant and not dull like some gold shoes.
3,Zipper went bust within 6 months,"Not too impressed by the quality of the product. Within 6 months of daily use, the zipper started to get caught to the point it took 2-3 adults attempting to open the lunchbox (forget about a small child trying to open it!). Gave up on the lunchbox in frustration and went with another brand."
2,"shamelessly boring, an uninspired improvization","The movie can be described as ""several days in the lives of a nymphomaniac, a sucker, and a satyr/gigolo"". Between their sordid sexual romps in squalid rooms with various people, the three sit (endlessly it seems) boozing and smoking and soliloquizing about sex, and life, death, and themselves--just to hear themselves talk. If they were at least good-looking (they are plain)! Don't they have anything to do with their lives? No ambitions? No purpose? How about finding a job, Alexander, and stopping borrowing money from your sucker girlfriend? And why should anyone care about these runting losers?PS: I don't give this one star because the story, such as it is, is not buried in flashbacks and the camera does not endlessly blur and swing around. Thank God for little favors!"
3,The Mother and the Whore,"Although the item was a Cannes film festival winner and difficult to find it was a bit disappointing. The story line itself was a bit drawn out and bizarre, very risque and racy for its time. I was disappointed with the condition in which it arrived. Advertised as almost pristine same, arrived in a very much used condition. Shipping a bit slower than most other items received from Amazon vendors. Overall, it was ok/mediocre rating and transaction."
5,Finally!,"At long last, someone has tackled the fascinating story of the Bennett family. The result was well worth the wait. Kellow's book is enthralling, nicely balanced, objective, and well-researched. Anyone interested in Joan or Constance Bennett or even in film history will enjoy this book."
2,Superficial and embarrassing,"This book has CORBA 3 in the title but CORBA 3 doesn't even exist yet. Despite this claim to conformance to a non-existing standard, the code examples use the BOA, which was deprecated ages ago. The POA is covered in only about three pages, which nowhere near enough. Other topics are covered to a similar level of non-detail. This book is definitely no use if you are programmer, and even for non-programmers, the coverage is probably too superficial to be of much use."
1,Embarrassment for the OMG,"The book is a major disappointment. How can the title include ""CORBA 3"", althought the specification isn't even available (and won't be for quite some time)? Things that have long been deprecated (like the BOA) are still being used for the code samples. Important topics such as the POA are described in a few pages only. It seems that the author tries to explain everything there is to CORBA, but only manages to scratch the surface of each topic. It is a roller coaster of topics which is to be expected by having a dozen co-authors. The most embarrassing fact is that the author is working for the OMG. Spend your money on the excellent book by Henning & Vinoski. Whatever programming language you use, Siegel's book is worthless."
1,If you have nothing to say - write a stupid book,"I was really raging that I bought this book. Full of buzzwords, whithout any deeper knowledge. There are a lot of very good CORBA books, but this is no one. This one is only ga ga."
1,Lacks depth,Book does not convey information in a concise way. Quite voluminous book with no depth. Definitely not a good book for any level of programmers.
1,No.,"For some reason I thought that since this was a PBS documentary that it would be science based and address how the brain interprets emotion or something social science related. Instead, it was a motivational speaker using anecdotal evidence as if it were real science and then telling me not to be afraid and that everything will be ok.I guess I'll give ""this emotional life"" a try, but this one wasn't worth the time.This Emotional Life"
5,Best Kinesiology Textbook for Joint Mechanics!,"As an Instructor of Musculoskeletal anatomy, physiology, and kinesiology classes, Chiropractor, and author of books on the musculoskeletal system, I buy and read most every book published on the subject of kinesiology. Donald Neumann's book on Kinesiology is hands-down the absolute best kinesiology textbook out for joint mechanics. His book is clearly written in a straight-forward manner that makes it accessible to most anyone and yet it is also the most thorough book on this subject. Further, Elisabeth Rowan's illustrations are the best I have ever seen in a kinesiology text; they are sharp and clear, enabling 3-Dimensional movement to be easily visualized on a 2-Dimensional page. I believe that this book is a must for any student of the musculoskeletal system!"
2,great 'undergraduate' book,"Great for reference, research, and academics but completely clinically useless. sorry, but theres much better books out their, nor should 'rehabilitation' be attached to this book."
5,"Mentor, storyteller","Dr. Fremling, I will address this to you. You were graduate advisor to my dad, Glenn Jergens, when he earned his Master's degree. You were my most revered college professor many years later. Now I have my Master's and will teach biology when our son doesn't need me at home quite so much. Your influence on my dad, and on me, was profound. If I am half the teacher you were, much of the credit will be yours. I remember the slide-peppered lectures and the frequent field trips that made scientists of your students. I appreciate more than ever your gift for making learning so effortless because the teaching was so relevant and so rigorously planned. I have rated your book as worthy of five stars even before I've read it, as I suspect it will reflect this gift as well. I'm purchasing two copies, one for my brother and his wife, which will be passed around, I know, and one for my family. Thank you, Dr. Fremling, and congratulations. With all best wishes, Merri Beth Nord"
2,I broke it.,"This is a certainly a good CD player. But why is it so inexpensive? AH, because it wouldn't last as long as others. I have had other CD players before, and dropping them unto the ground happened was nothing special. But this Panasonic Player stopped working only after one time of falling down from my bed unto the floor. If you are a man with care, don't pay attention to this; if you think this player is likely to pass through some tough journeys, then get a tougher machine."
5,captivating,"This dvd gives you a strong peak into a time period over Arab on Radar's life span. From touring, to select shows/performances, interviews and commentary, it is very thorough, and never stops moving! Loved it!"
1,"Nope, not worth it","Recommended ages 1-8+? I think not. I got this for my 6-year-old to start learning Spanish from. I thought I'd prescreen it before having him watch it. I'd say this truly is for ages 1- 4 TOPS. And like another review mentioned, the pronunications are questionable, and there are some errors. I'll be looking into other language learning options."
3,BUYERS BEWARE,"Once again, another cheap plastic lens from Tamron, including the PLASTIC LENS MOUNT! Save your money and buy the 18-250mm lens for another 100 bucks. You lose a whopping 50mm at the long end, but the optics and build are superior plus a gain on the short end.If you don't want to spend that much then consider the Sigma 28-300mm, unfortunatly the optics are a bit less than the Tamron 28-300mm, but the build quality is definitely superior."
2,Disappointed,"I recently purchased this lens after realizing I need an all in one for an event coming up. After hooking it up on a Sony Alpha 100 I was pretty disappointed, took about 20 test shots and everything seemed fine while viewing them on the computer until I looked at the actual size. Ghosting all over the images, blades of grass blurred and lost quite a bit of detail. Further tests all got the same result, slowing down and speeding up the shutter didn't help. Just to make sure my camera hadn't just broken I put on a 70-210mm Minolta lens and experienced none of that blurriness associated with the Tamron."
5,Fantastic product,"Love this lens, wish I'd bought it sooner. No more having to Change lenses all the time for close ups and zoom"
4,Versatile Lens,Light weight compact lens with a huge range of focal lengths. This has been my everyday lens for several years and it's never had a problem.
2,Mine came apart,"Spend a little more and get one that screws together, such as the Photon. Mine came apart where the two pieces snap together."
1,Handy but turns on too easily,"Tiny and nice and bright, would be the perfect keychain light - except it turns on much too easily. I keep my keys in my purse and it would be on when I took them out, draining the batteries. It's possible to replace the batteries, but very difficult to get it back together just right and batteries will probably cost you as much as the whole light does anyway. For the number of times I really used it probably cost me $2 per light."
1,Light turns on too easily,"Echoing what's been said here...I've had the light for only about 4 months...and when I take my keys out of my pocket, I often find the light on. The battery is now so weak that the light is pretty much useless. Wrote the company a few weeks ago and haven't heard anything."
3,the switch needs improvement,"the switch on mine isn't always sure when it is 'on'. it doesn't have a positive feeling when switching either way. sometimes it feels like it switched, but it didn't. the switch needs to be changed to one that gives a positive feeling when changing positions on/off."
5,"Newer-released examples have solved the ""sensitive switch"" problem","My Pulsar II had a three-way switch with three modes:1. OFF mode (disengages the ""squeeze & shine"" mode that others complained drained the battery)2. Squeeze & shine mode3. ON modeI don't know if other users did not notice this difference, or, more likely, if the switch on my model is an improvement over older models. FYI, I bought mine in October 2009 from REI, not from Amazon, so: caveat emptor."
4,Battery weak,"I was a little dissapointed by the fact that the battery was almost dead when I received the light and the light was so weak it would barely go 1 foot. However, after replacing the battery the red light is very intense and I am very happy with it. If you have to replace the battery try to remember how you took it apart since the internals are very simple and takes a bit to get it right. The cost also is a bit high for this little device but the light is very bright which I am very satisfied with."
5,ANOTHER OVERLOOKED GEM !,"This is one of the better first hand accounts of WWII I have read. It is the personal, first hand view of the war by a german soldier. It is all the more remarkable in that it is written by an enlisted man, something we see far too little of. The majority of the story takes place on the Russian Front. It is difficult to understand how anyone could have survivied such an ordeal. The book is well written, thoughtful and completely captivating. I find it quite remarkable that it is not better known. From a personal view point, I had relatives fighting on both sides (U.S. and German) in this war, and I found it quite interesting that this german soldier's stories and expierences were quite identical to those of our side. A soldier is a soldier is a soldier. I cannot recommend this one highly enough. Well written, well done. It will be one that you will want to add to your library. I first read this one in 1985 and have given it several reads since then."
2,"Not bad, but.....","Eat the Rich just isn't the same without the big burp at the end (which is on the original album version on Get a Grip), so I give this only two stars. We need more burping on cds."
1,Worst album of the 90s,"This disaster epitomizes all that is wrong with corporate sellout rock music. Aerosmith is responsible for some of the greatest rock of the 70s, but here they hired some professional writers and set a torch to their storied legacy. Crazy, Amazing, Crying, Blind Man - each is rewrite of the other and they all belong on a Cher album. Seriously. They have nothing to do with rock n roll. Aerosmith had a FEW decent tracks from this time period (FINE, Young Lust, The Other Side, geez I'll even say that What It Takes was ok for a ballad), but the rest of this album is pure schmaltzy vegas pablum. Man, even the cover looks like it was whipped together in 3 minutes. And come on - how stupid is the title? ""Big Ones, get it? Har har har"". Hey, if you know these songs and you love 'em, then more power to you and have fun with this album. Anyone else who wants to expereince the real Aerosmith should start with Rocks. Aerosmith: No shame."
1,"Terrible, Just Noise","Awful CD. Aerosmith are one of the most overplayed and overratedrock bands of all time behind the even worse, AC/DC. The singerjust screams, this isn't music, this is just noise. I mean theonly good song is Janie's Got a Gun, everyelse spit. This musicis trash, throw it away and don't buy it again.Get Your Wings is all you need from this overrated band."
2,Mediocre music for mediocre people,"Aerosmith is basically another mediocre, radio-friendly pop band that would have thankfully faded away if it wasn't for the Rap/Rock group Run D.M.C. redoing one of their songs, ""Walk this Way"", in the 90s. Aerosmith owes alot of their success to Run D.M.C., and I doubt they could have made it this far on their own without having been part of the first rap-rock song hybrid, which was originated by RUN D.M.C.Albeit, if you are an Old burn-out living paycheck to paycheck then this album is probably for you."
3,"Some Big, Mostly Medium Ones","This album is a re-hash of the group's hit rock singles from 1987-1994, with a couple of unreleased cuts included. Of course the overplayed radio hits are there, including ""Crazy"", ""Amazing"", and the ever-whining ""Cryin'"". Some good cuts from ""Permanent Vacation"" and ""Pump"" are included. I was not impressed by this album at all. This CD is for the casual listener of Aerosmith, die hard fans should not bother."
3,Not the biggest,"A lot of the radio hits, but why cut out the stuff that makes the songs great. How can you listen to Love in a elavator without the kinky intro. Or janie's got a gun without the water song. And while these songs were mtv's favorites, They don,t reflect the best of those albums. And how come there no mention of Done with mirrors. Let the music do the talking is better then half the overplayed songs on this cd."
5,Whole Lotta BIG ONES,"I found this album at Strawberries, and what a find it was! It's a nice mix of some of their songs from the last three albums, but it kicks off with a ROCKIN' tune called ""Walk On Water"" which lets Steven make that harmonica sing and does their whole blues infused vibe justice. Also on the album is another great song called ""Deuces Are Wild'. Long story short: It's a nice mix of both '80's and '90's songs, so if you like a little bit of both, you won't go wrong with this album."
4,What you'd expect,"Throughout their career, Aerosmith has been known for signing contracts with new labels before fulfilling the obligations of their old ones. As a result, they are constantly releasing greatest hits albums as well as live recordings. Here is yet another one. This covers all the singles from ""Permanent Vacation"" through ""Get A Grip."" Singles like ""Janie's got a Gun"" and ""Cryin"" are bound to require multiple plays if you haven't heard them already. The downside of this album though is the blandness of the two new tracks, ""Blind Man"" and ""Walk on Water."" These uninspired tracks left fans in an oblivion after this release, wondering where the future of the band's songs would lie. Thankfully, they rebounded nicely with ""Nine Lives."" However, if you are interested in the greatest moments during Aerosmith's rise to rock/pop kings, here is the release for you."
5,Aero's Unending Glory,"These Guys never stopped rockin'from the 70's to the present. They never failed the rock fans with their infectious rock music from Generation X to Generation Y, from the unsurpassed style of rock vocals in each track courtesy of Steven Tyler to the ass kickin' riffs of Joe Perry.Undoubtedly, Aerosmith is here to stay.The album contains 15 tracks which is a collection of songs from the Geffen archive. For beginners, this is the second wave of Aero Songs. If you want more look for the Columbia released Aerosmith Greatest Hits.The Best... So Far"
5,"If you like Aerosmith, buy this video!","I have all the Aerosmith videos, and this one tops them all. Read the book (""Walk This Way"") and watch the video. Guaranteed to rock out your evening and keep you bopping for days!"
4,It's great but some good songs were missing,"This cd it's great but some good songs were missing I mean why didn't they record ""sweet emotion"", ""Dream on"" and a few more. Well maybe the answer is they wanted to make extra cash selling the ""A little south of sanity"" album. That's why I give this album 4 stars. I really like this band and one of my fantasies is having Mr. Tyler as my father inlaw, HEY suegro no te preocupes yo hare feliz a tu hija Liv pero muy feliz."
5,One of the best video compilations on VHS,"Definitely one of the best videos to come out of promotion for the band. If it's a greatest hit, it's on this video. Highly recommended! Videos include, (not in order):From PERMANENT VACATION:Dude Looks Like A Lady Angel Rag DollFrom PUMP: Love in an Elevator Janie's Got a Gun What it Takes The Other SideFrom GET A GRIP: Eat the Rich Living on the Edge Cryin' Amazing CrazyFrom BIG ONES:Walk on Water Blind Man Deuces Are WildIf many of these happen to be your favorite Aerosmith tunes, then this is the video for you. It's awesome. Sit back, relax and look. :-D"
3,WOW!,WOW! That is the word 2 describe this CD. I fell n love w/ it the 1st time I heard it. It is great. Every1 should have this CD.
3,AWESOMELY BIG,This collection is truly THE GREATEST HITS COLLECTION of all times. a must-have in your private library. The second greatest hits cd that is out now is more like a remix of some of their old stuff and a couple of newer song but this one's a mayor a** kicker this CD ROXX.
4,Big Fun,"Like the title suggests some of Aerosmith's biggest known revival hits are on this release. I think what should be on any compilation is subjective, but I think the point of this release was to gather a lot of hits in one place. And that they did.Big Ones is still a good release, and Big Fun to listen to."
4,BIG 1s,"I think this was a very good record to put out. To start out on a good note, the last 3 songs are the best, along with Janies Got a Gun and various others. The downside is some of the songs are not so great. For example, Amazing and Blind Man. The rest are great! Amazing, sounds like the rise and fall of his drug addiction. It starts out with... I let the wrong ones in And let the rights ones outI was glad when it was over. Execpt for these 2 songs, it was awesome! I highly recommend it for any Aerosmith fan."
5,Greatest Rock N Roll Band Ever!,"The band Aerosmith has been around for about 30 years, I have been around for 16. I have had Aerosmith's music in my life since I was born and I grew up watching their videos. I love their music and their lyrics are powerful and have meaning to them, unlike todays Hard Rock. In my oppinion I think they are the greatest Rock N Roll band to come into the music scene since the Beatles. I have a great appreciation for the band and I cant wait for them to keep the amazing music comming!"
5,A great cd,This cd has some of the greatest songs that Aerosmith has ever made. If you want to listen to some great tunes than I suggest buying this.
2,Well...................,"I am the eleven year old boy who gave this two stars on the fifth of June. I read a couple reviews and I found one comment that I should have added in my review. If you like the old Aerosmith, than this is not a CD for you. If you are a newcomer to Aerosmith, and you buy this CD you might like it. I bought Toys in the Attic after this CD and I liked it alot more than Big Ones."
2,What??,"I bought this for my first Aerosmith CD and I hated it. It only had about 3 good songs on it and the rest where downers. If you are reading this, take some of my advice and get Toys in the Attic or Rocks instead of this."
4,Great 80's/Early 90's Collection,"First and foremost, ""Big Ones"" is not a definitive Aerosmith collection. What it is, however, is a great collection of tunes culled from their second successful run that started in the mid-80's and ran its course through the early 90's. There are bigger, better, and more complete collections of their hits out there, but for a quick roadtrip, this is the perfect album. It includes ""Dude (Look Like A Lady),"" ""Janie's Got A Gun,"" and ""Amazing."" It also has the wonderful ""Rag Doll"" and one of the best hard rock ballads, ""Angel."" A couple of new tunes are also thrown in, but they can't even begin to overshadow the rest of this album.Naturally hardcore fans will want a more extensive collection of Aerosmith's hits. In most cases, if you're that much of a fan you've probably got most of their albums anyway. For people who just want a decent helping of the band's hits though, this album is perfect."
5,fast delivery,Received sooner than expected and was in perfect condition!!! One of my favorite CD's of all time...
4,"Best of the ""comeback"" albums.","This is kind of an odd collection. It's not career-spanning, and only takes the hits from ""Permanent Vacation"", ""Pump"", and ""Get A Grip"". But if you're a fan of their early 90's work, this is for you. Included is ""Angel"", ""Love In An Elevator"", and ""Cryin'"", as well as ""Dude (looks like a lady)"", ""Janie's Got A Gun"", and ""Livin' On The Edge"". Plus many more, including a few new songs. ""Dueces Are Wild"" is really good. Pretty much all these songs are on the 2-disc collections, but if this is the era you like, then you'll love ""Big Ones"". It would go perfect with the earlier ""Greatest Hits"" album."
3,Somewhat indistinguishable with Tinkyada,I find this brand quite comparable to Tinkyada in texture and flavor. It is a thin pasta so you have to be very careful to not overcook.
5,Mens baseball shoe with cleats,"My 16 year old grandson has size 14 feet and it is hard to find shoes for him. He is playing baseball this year and needed cleats so I looked around. For the price, you can't beat these shoes. My grandson says they fit great and he likes them, so that is good enough for me. The price was right, they fit him great, and everyone is happy."
5,What a deal!,$9.99 for a pair of awesome cleats. Size was correct and they were in pristine condition. Colors are perfect as my son's school colors are black and orange. Comfortable....
1,bottle was destroyed,bottle was destroyed when we opened the package. all pills were in tiny glass shards since we didnt have time to return it we have to throw them away.
4,Looks and feels like the real thing. Just doesn't bark.,"This is a very nice stuffed animal. Purchased for our granddaughter. It's as big as her, but doesn't need to go outside or barks. She loves it and even puts it to bed in her bed. Great product."
3,simpl..,This book is small but has pretty good information. I've had a hamstring issue for 2 years and have not been able to run. I think this will finally get me started again.
1,A deceiving title,"Please don't get me wrong! There's a reasons for this low rating:This is NOT the best of Whitesnake, its simply a collection of songs taken from only 3 of the bands 11 studio albums. I think it's deceiving to call it ""Whitesnake's greatest hits"", even tho the songs themselves are good. I guess it all has something to do with the rights to the material, and maybe the fact that the earlier work of Whitesnake is rather unknown in America. As an introduction to this great band I guess it's alright but for the more than casual fan it won't do.I advise you to get the original studio albums instead, because Whitesnake is one of the best bands in this genre. From the early blues rock, via the more traditional hard rock to heavy metal, Coverdale with his amazing voice have been able to release top material time after time."
4,Whitesnake: Led Zeppelin influenced hair metal.,"Though not obvious on tracks such as ""Here I Go Again"" and ""Now You're Gone"", Whitesnake is a band that was hugely influenced by Led Zeppelin. Listen to ""Judgement Day"" and ""Still of the Night"" and you will understand what I mean. Though Whitesnake has been much maligned for their sometimes corny lyrics and too-slick sound, they are still a solid band. And though too many sound alike ballads are included on this greatest hits album, this is still a solid disc.David Coverdale, Whitesnake's singer and main songwriter, is an excellent vocalist. The guitarists on this album (most notably John Sykes and Steve Vai) are excellent so you can't go wrong there. Good performances all around.If you like Led Zeppelin influenced hair metal, buy this disc!"
4,This is good...,"This is a good sample of Whitesnake's most successful years (Slide It In, Whitesnake, and Slip Of The Tongue). The track selection was well chosen and the unreleased songs are good. There's now a double cd out which contains all the songs from this time period, but this is the one to get for new or casual fans. John Sykes is a great guitarist. Check out Blue Murder if you like this."
3,Much too narrow,"No, no, no, no....Most of this album is dedicated to songs from Whitesnake's two pop metal albums from the late eighties, and that is just not a fair picture of the great blooze-and-boogie outfit that was Whitesnake in the late seventies and early eighties, before the keyboard-laden hair metal fad.These may be Whitesnake's greatest hits (at least in the US), but they are not the best of Whitesnake, and those looking for a comprehensive overview of this underrated British band would be better served by the double-disc ""The Silver Anniversary Collection"", which, although it's not perfect, does a much better job, drawing from almost all the group's albums. And if you really want this MTV-stuff, at least check out the new compilaion ""The Early Years"" as well!"
4,Good Songs From The 80's,Loved this band at the end of the 80's and still enjoy listening to them now. Great memories.
5,"SUPURB,PROBABL THE BEST I'VE EVER HEARD","I THOUGHT THE MUSIC WAS REALLY GOOD,THE CONTENT WAS SOMEWHAT TOO BE DESIDERED,IT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD CRANKED UP.INSTEA OF BUYING THE CD& TAPING IT SO I WOULD HAVE IT IN MY CAR,I WENT AHEAD AND ""BOUGHT""BOTH."
4,"""Slide It In"" your cd player.","I must admit, when these guys were hot, I was listening to other things, but I'm glad I eventually checked them out. This is a good collection for the casual fan. It's actually missing alot, but it does include the big hits from the ""Whitesnake"" album, plus a number of others. What's here is ""Still Of The Night"", ""Slide It In"", ""Here I Go Again"", and the hit ballad ""Is This Love"". It also includes a few choice album cuts like ""Crying In The Rain"" and ""Looking For Love"". Overall it's a great disc, and will go well with ""White Lion"" and ""Great White"", (to complete your ""White"" metal trilogy of course)."
5,Nomads,"This movie has a very interesting premise. I am not a big fan of Pierce Brosnan but he is very good in this movie. The ending will definately make you say ""Holy C%^&!! I was not expecting that"". Very good movie based on Innuit tribal lore."
4,Interesting Thriller!,"Pierce Bronson plays as a French Anthropologist in this 1986 supernatural thriller who was attacked by a mysterious street gang, now he is stalking them and discovers the shocking truth about them, is that they are nomadic spirits.Well-made if complicated movie with little horror to it, it does have some decent scares and good acting, the ending is preety much twisted!Worth checking out if your into ""Sixth Sense""."
5,Nomads - A great Movie,The movie is fantastic. If you love supernatural movies you will love this one. Imagine creatures that exist in our world that no one ever sees unless you are unfortunate to be noticed by them.
2,Nomads,"The movie was relatively boring until the end when one finally understands what is going on. At the end when the two women are trying to escape the motorcycle rider and he stops at the border of California it violates the whole premise of the move as he has become a ""Nomad"" and cannot be stopped by any kind of borders.The acting was only fair and even Pierce Brosnan seemed stiff and uncomfortable in this role. And, as for the ""male frontal nudity,"" that's a joke too. Pierce is naked but the shadows are so dark nothing is visible in the scene.Save your time and money and see Pierce in ""The Thomas Crown Affair."""
5,The gift that keeps on giving,"This came to me as a gift along with Carnival of Souls. I had seen this movie many years ago. It had seemed kind of hokey at the time, but now seeing it, this film seems much better. True, it is low budget, but it is sincere and the acting is pretty good. The ending was kind of a convenient ripoff way to resove the film, but the rest of it was pretty good. Each of the girls though should have taken the first clue when they picked the guy up on the road and he disapeared from the car without opening the door....duh! Christopher Lee is in this before he became an international star. Does he just get better and better or what? Along with Carnival of Souls, this is a can't miss CD for lovers of old classic horror movies."
5,GOOD ATMOSPHERIC HORROR....,"AKA ""Horror Hotel"" this is a good little shocker in b&w from England. VCI does it proud on DVD with nice extras like the interview with Venetia Stevenson (director Robert Stevenson's daughter). She plays Nan Barlow, a college student sent to an eerie fog shrouded village to do a paper on witchcraft and winds up being a human sacrifice instead. Her fiance' and a friend come looking for her and find things indeed off-kilter. The whole village is witch infested save for a blind priest and his niece. Christopher Lee is the sinister professor who sent Nan there in the first place. This is a low budget gem that runs at a brisk pace and keeps you glued to the screen. Highly recommended for horror lovers."
4,A great little lost horror thriller. Definitely underrated!,"Don't be put off by the cheesy title. This little gem is way ahead of its time. Chris Lee gives a great performance as the sinister lecturer on New England witchcraft lore. His New England accent, while not perfect, comes as something of a surprise from the dark man of horror. The cinematography is what sets this film apart. Crisp and atmospheric describes this well. The plot is fairly conventional stuff, but holds up well in light of the recent spate of teen horror films.All in all, this is one tight little horror thriller, guarenteed to please. To contrast Lee's performance with something current, I recommend finding ""A Feast At Midnight"", which is a charming film, with a great ""against type"" performance from Lee."
4,Brilliance on a budget,"HORROR HOTEL is what B movies is all about. It has stacks to offer: atmosphere, unintentional laughs, gimmicks and lots of suspence. A crazed history school-teacher (marvelouly played by Christopher Lee) who tells one of his students (who is learning about witchcraft) to go and stay at a horrific hotel called the 'Raven's Inn' and who can forget that good ol' PSYCHO gimmick with the heroine dieing near the begining of the film. Worth a glimpse for anyone who is intrested in low-budget film making and also to the fans."
4,A Good Story about Witches,"When I was little around(12-14)this movie scared me. It was one of those sleep over,scare the girls movies, we enjoyed it. Which is why I love this movie for the memories it gave me."
3,A CAMPY B&W BUDGET B-MOVIE THATS SPOOKY,"I have not seen Horror Hotel in years, I saw it back in the early 70's on the Chiller theater show out of New York. This movie gave me the creeps when I was a teenager. Although a low budget, campy B&W film with a witchcraft theme. With a guest appearance by the classic horror man himself, Christopher Lee, the film is dark and shadowy, set in a spooky Salem Mass. town filled with dreary fog, and strange looking town folk. But the real spooker is a woman (Witch)by the name of Elizabeth Sullivan - she has a face of pure evil, without any makeup ! The kind of person you might have trust in, but when your not looking, she'll put a knife in your back ! The best scene is when the deaf mute 'Lottie' is found in the hidden catacomb just before the climax of the film - a satanic sacrifice. But beware of the shadow of the cross !"
5,Horror Hotel - Great Oldie,This is one of the great old horror movies. A must have in anyone's collection especially around Halloween.
3,City of the squashed,I've tried this DVD on a couple of players with a standard 4:3 TV screen and in both cases the aspect ratio went awry; the whole picture seems to have been flattened out to fill the screen leaving the cast members looking as if they've come back from a few months on a really gruelling health farm. Very disappointing - did the makers do something wierd with the anamorphic stuff because all the other anamorphic DVDs I have display correctly (letterboxed) on a standard TV.
3,City of The Dead/Horror Hotel 1960 VHS B&W,"I had this VHS and now can't find it,but I thought the movie was creepy and worth watching it. I know the movie as ""Horror Hotel"" and I know about it thanks to the misfits."
4,Nice Idea,Thw author did a good job but he tries to cram too much material into one book. This work tends to drag out in points and is almost deviod of humor.
4,Reads Like A Novel,"Winik captures the drama and uncertainity of the ending of the American Civil War. The thrill of history is that life did not have to be as it was and Winik anwers why this story turned out the way it did. The greatness of Lincoln, Grant and Lee and to lesser extent Sherman, Johnston and Forrest is confirmed by Winik's narrative. If these men are not judged by the arrogance of presentism-they deserved the title of great enlightened men. So many interserting quotes and facts (Sherman writing a memo for President Polk on the discovery of gold in California)(p.304) the footnoes occasionally seem inadequate. Simon Cameron is referred to as Lincoln's tresury secretary (p.240) when he was the first war secretary 1861-62. In criticsim of Lincoln's April 11, 1865 speech Winik refres to Chase as his treasury secretary when at ime he was Chief Justice. (p.217)"
2,A lawyer's summation for a guilty client.,"Good idea, some good information, at times good dramatic pacing. But Winik has a bee in his bonnet and his arguments about the likelihood of guerilla warfare after Appomatox are paper-thin. ""Critics and ethicists today argue that his scorched-earth policies violated all the strictures of . . . justice in warfare,"" he says of Sherman. His fawning over Jeff Davis is extraordinary. His language is often bombastic. Dresses in new clothes some of the old ideas - the war was really about states' rights, the slaves were treated benignly, the South had a noble heritage. History taken from primary sources belies these concepts. Argues the case, doesn't change the verdict."
5,Civil War,Bought this as a Christmas Gift for my brother in law and he just loved it. Sat right down and began to read it as soon as he opened it. Great book for Civil war buffs.
2,Bloated History,"April 1865 is an excellent example of a long magazine piece that has been blown up into a full-length book. I found it tendentious as well as too clever by half. In addition I took great exception to his portrayal of Robert E. Lee as the acme of Civil War generals. Now, if you want to read an excellent book about the Civil War and beyond, try Jean Smith's biography of U.S. Grant. What a great read!"
4,The month that created a nation,"The one problem I have with this book is the way that Winik portrays Lee and Grant. Lee's virtues are portrayed as heroic,and even his vices are depicted as the manifestations of a superior man. Grant on the other hand, comes across as a loser who basically bumbled his way into being the first Lieutenant General since Washington. I hope the reader won't take Winik's word on Grant but read instead one of the many good Grant biographies out there. My favorite is ""Grant"" by Jean Edward Smith.Despite that caveat, the author brilliantly illustrates what I have been saying much more clumsily for years. That is that the American Revolution did not end with the victory at Yorktown. The American Revolution did not truly create a nation until the end of the Civil War and the convulsions of reconstruction that followed. As Winik says, it could easily have turned out differently anywhere along the way.This is an excellent read: highly recommended."
2,don't listen to this book,"This book is painful to listen to. The publishers made a mistake by letting the author read it. His lispy voice does not make for good reading. As someone who listens to many audio books, it was very disappointing to hear such a bad reading of what seems like a good book.If you are interested in this topic, buy the book and read it. DO NOT waste money on the audio version. It's that bad."
2,"Great idea, mawkishly executed","The idea of writing a book to explore the impact of a single month in American history has great appeal, and Winik does a decent job of capturing the flow of events in a compelling narrative. But the WRITING!!! As breathless and mawkish as a sophomore's mash note. There were numerous occasions on which I had to restrain the urge to fling the book across the room. Overblown metaphors, hyperbolic historical comparisons, artificially dramatic phrasing, and over-liberal use of the post-cliffhanger single sentence response make this book read like history as told by a Hollywood hack screenwriter.Oy."
5,One of The Best History Books I Ever Read,"APRIL 1865 is a one of the best history book I ever read.Through detail and imagery, Jay Winik brings events and characters to life and tells an emotionally moving story, partly because he he able to see history from different perspectives.This book is certainly not dry, factual history.Winik clearly has a take on the forces that drive history, which he makes a strong case for. His book, therefore, has a message. (I won't give it away.)Randy"
2,Title is misnomer,"This book is simply not about April 1865, the Month that Saved America.It is instead an overview of the war and a collection of brief biographies of the generals who fought it. If you are looking for that, this book is acceptable. If you want an analysis of the subject cited in the title, look elsewhere."
4,The Last Secession,"I started ""1865"" expecting a bullet-by-bullet account of key battles along with the life stories of all the usual generals. It is anything but a military account. Winik reminds us that prior to the Southern Secession, some New England states had threatened to leave the Union over the War of 1812. And armed rebellion was nothing new either, when you consider that, as Winik points out, frontier farmers had fielded a small army to fight against Hamilton's whiskey tax. More startling was reading about Jefferson Davis's General Order Number 14, emancipating slaves who enlisted for the Confederacy. (Of course, civil rights in a future independent Confederate nation was another matter.) Winik makes the case that the South was really fighting for its independence, not slavery, and that whether the Union existed in perpetuity was, until this last secession, a question that had not been completely resolved....""April 1865"" is a brilliant distillation, but still ..."
4,Some new facts,An interesting book with new facts you didn't learn in school about that time period. Fleshes out a lot of the characters from the Civil War.
3,READ this book . . . pass on the tape,"I travel extensively by car and listen to a lot of audio books for education and entertainment. I was delighted to finally buy an audio book that was read by the author. Now I know why there are professional readers.... this is a well written, very interesting book ... But the author made a serious mistake when he decided to read the book aloud personally instead of using a professional reader. The author's nasal voice and dreary delivery detract from the material. History is not very entertaining when it sounds like this.Winik is a very talented author, but ... I advise that you READ this book and pass on the audio version."
2,Military Analysis Suspect,"The author dedicates a good portion of the first half of the book to a praising description of the life of Lee. He seems to argue that Lee saved the country by not ordering a guerilla war. Grant's strategy which brought the war to a close in 1864-65 is not mentioned.The second half of the book is much more interesting, especially the discussion on the development of the role of the vice-president.I would not recommend the book to someone looking for an introduction to the Civil War."
5,April 1865,April 1865This was one of the best books on the Civil War time period my wife has ever read.
3,It's About Time Someone Pointed This Out,"It's about time someone pointed out what a valuable service to the nation the principals in this story performed. While the book is really more narrative than analytical, it does expose for debate a proposition that students of history ought to consider carefully--that we are one country today (rather than two constantly warring factions bound within a common border) because in April of 1865 a handfull of men had that rare combination of vision and guts that compelled them to swallow their pride (in the case of the southern protagonists) and extend magnanimity (Lincoln, Grant, et.al.) in the face of enormous emotional and popular incentives to do the opposite. While this is probably a too-nuanced view of history to sit well with those who like their heros and villans cut entirely from distinct cloth, it is closer to life than history usually gets."
2,Spotty Scholarship,"While I consider myself something of a history buff, I've never really gotten the Civil War bug. This year my parents tried to draw me in with ""April 1865"".While I liked many of the Winik's observations and tangents, even a cursory scan revealed errors that a good fact checker should have caught. Compounding these simple errors were stilted classical allusions that seemed either incredibly obscure or incorrect.As a neophyte, I gained a fair bit of information on the War and the primary actors. I only wish that I could trust the strength of Winik's scholarship. As it is, I feel like I'll need to do follow up reading just to accept Winik's arguments.This is not what I would have expected given the warm praise on the backcover."
4,April 1865 - The Month that Saved America - Book,The book is excellent. I read almost everything I can get my hands on regarding the Civil War (War Between the States). I first saw this book in a library on vacation and could not finish it due to time constraints. It is well written and an outstanding overview of critical events that took place in the last month of the Civil War that could have proven disastrous for the USA if the people that shaped those events had not acted in the manner they did.Regarding the purchase. The book is new but it came without the book jacket. That is OK but most of the other books on my shelves have jackets.GA John
3,????,"Remove the biographies of the major characters and this book has very little to offer. Richmond burns, Lee and Johnston surrender, Lincoln is assassinated and then the funeral....okay, so we do get to see how the government continued for the hours after Lincoln's death...but where's the beef?"
4,Knawing little inaccuracies,"I like this book. Winik is a good storyteller and gives about as unbiased view of the War For Southern Independence as can be given and still be published. When the politically correct crowd and their professional victim allies are trying to remove Lee's image from Richmond, Winik has the courage to tell America that Lee, as much as Lincoln, is responsible for the fact that we have won the lottery of life by being born with an American passport. But, I can never forgive him for referring to ""Little Billy"" Mahone as the ""tall general"" who rode beside Lee. Mahone was lots of things, but at four feet and change, tall wasn't one of them."
2,Audio Tape Review,"This is an enjoyable book with a lot of interesting information. However, the audiocassette version is a prime example of why an author SHOULD NOT be the reader of their book! It is torture to listen to the tapes and the recording performance distracts from the subject.It sounds just like someone reading a text when they are unfamiliar with the material. The intonations are off, the emphasis is in the wrong places, and punctuation is missing or unnoticeable. Words are mispronounced and parts sound like disjointed or long run on sentences.Buy the book and you'll enjoy it! Buy the audio version and you'll probably regret it! I've listened to several hundred audiobooks and this is one of the most difficult to tolerate."
4,"If you read one book on history this year, make it this one.","Jay Winik's ""April 1865"" is a gem. I hesistated to read this book as I have read rather extensively on this period of U.S. history and wanted to expand the scope of my knowledge to other topics. I am so glad that I couldn't help myself. Winik does not hesitate to express an opinion and back it up factually. His research is obviously extensive and his ability to convey just how precariously the future of our Union was after Lee's surrender and Lincoln's assasination is riviting. The author's use of collective reference rather than numerical citation makes the read that much more enjoyable. This belongs with McPhearsons ""Battle Cry of Freedom"" and David Herbert Donald's ""Lincoln"" on the bookshelf of any budding historian."
1,Introduction raises serious scholarship questions,"I was reading the introduction to Winik's book, and it seemed somehow familiar. Then, it hit me: it's almost identical to William Manchester's brilliant introduction to his book on Winston Churchill. I pulled out both books and couldn't believe how closely Winik's introduction parallels Manchester -- so much so that it raises issues of whether its plagierized. While I'm enjoying the book, it does make me wonder if other parts of the book likewise lack originality????"
3,too many tangents,"I enjoyed the concept of the story. But the author, just went to broad for me. As I was getting into what he was saying, he'd go back and off on a side bar or tangent for 3-5 pages, losing his current story line.I think it was an ambitious book with a lot of references (historically) from around the world, which was almost just a little too much for me.But don't let me disaude you from reading this. If you're curious please read it, there is still a lot of good Civil War history in this"
3,"Balance and Judgment, well written",Good perspective and analysis. A thoughtful and useful short book for ACW fans and those of us who wonder what all the thunder and lightning ends up meaning.
5,April 1865,"I recently choose April 1865 for a university seminar (as an adult returning student completing a BS degree.) It truly explains the events, characters, the ""whys"" this nation was plunged into the Civil War and how statesmen (both North and South) worked together to reunite woven states and labored to form a true United States. This book is a ""keeper""----to be read and reread and its great story not forgotten."
2,young gunz-tha roc's weakest link,its amazing in this world what having money can do 4 people.becuz it must take alot of money 2 promote garbage like this.these 2 catz r average rappers talkin tha same jive everyone else is talkin these days in hip hop.there just 2 young confused lil boys who wanna be men.thys album is about a 2.5 star album.decent heard it all before material that could have been better.
3,Decent album,"I agree with Rebecca Levine on this. These cats do not show promise that they'll be around. The formula they are using are not new or the future. The ROC are in shambles right now and are about to be brought out by Def Jam. How are you going to sign MOP, Joe Budden, Noreaga, Cam'ron and ODB to the label and you still have to release albums for All of State Property and Dipolmats? But back to the album. Production is okay. They really sound like everyone else to me. I'm done because I'm tired of this review.Top 3 Songs: Never Take Me Alive, Problemz, Friday NightBottom 3 Songs: Time, $$$ Girlz (this really sucks), Groovy ManSleeper: North of Death"
4,Young Gunz,"The young gunz cd is a most have for any real hip-hop fan. It has all the key ingredients for a great hiphop album. they take it to the streetz, their's also songs for the club."
4,Young Gunz R SICK!,"This album is sick. At least half the tracks are banging from 1st listen, the other half will probably take a few runs before the same will be true. Roc-a-fella is the future. Memph bleeks MADE is ill too. Camron soon..."
5,THE ROC KEEPS COMIN and COMIN,"WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY.....THE ROC IS #1...THEY KEEP IT COMIN WIT NEW FLAVA, NEW TALENT, AND SOME GOOD VIBES....THEY JUST KEEP OUTBEATIN THEMSELVES OVA AND OVA AGAIN....YOUNG GUNZ REALLY DID THERE THANG!!!....MAD RESPECT TO THEM AND THE ENTIRE ROCAFELLA TEAM....THIS ALBUM GOT SOME FUNK, HIP HOP, NASTY FLOWS AND THE BEATS IS A KILLA.....ALLL HEADBOPPERS....LISTEN TO #5.....WOW IS ALL I HAVE LEFT TO SAY.....GIVE A LISTEN THEN GO BUY IT....ITS WORTH IT!!!...IF YOU ARENT ALREADY A HIP HOP FAN THIS ALBUM WILL HELP YOU....OH P.S.....JAY IS KILLEN IT AS USUAL SO THERE YOU GO....THE FINISHING TOUCH.....!!!"
1,horrible i didnt even want to give it a one,OMG worst ch from roc ever everytime i listen to it my ears fell like there gonna bleed its a horrible album horrible beats. ahhh horrible very dissapointing
5,Still on Blast!!!,"I bought this CD the day it came out in Philly, I was in HS and i left class to go down the block and cop it. i spent all day in shool listening to the CD, I remember saying to a buddy that i thought this was the best CD i heard all year!!! I went college and this became the only CD i would listen to for the next couple of months!!! I still listen to the CD on occasion now, and It brings back great memories!!!! Every song has a story in my life that I tie to it. This is one of the ALL TIME BEST RAP CDs, only a CD of such quality can stand out in my mind the way this CD and its songs do. Thanx Young Gunz!!! Come back soon!!!"
4,Young Gunnaz!!,"I have no problem admittin these guys are the future of the roc. This cd is straight blazin from the first track ""Future of the roc"" to the spectacual ""Never take me alive(would've been better without gay-z though)."" People need to stop hatin on these guys because this is true hip-hop. They may have a few hip-pop songs on here, but most of the cd is blazin. Im glad gay-z retired and hopefully he doesnt come back. I think rocafella will shine now that gay-z retired, because it will give other artists a chance to shine and showcase their talent. I never really thought gay-z had any talent anyway. Actually i think he sucks and so does his music. ""The Black Album"" completely sucked and so did the rest of his albums. But anyway go get this cd, its a great cd."
3,A Pleasant Surprise,"I listened to this CD for the first time with low expectations. I had never been much impressed by the duo's lyrical prowess on Roc-A-Fella guest spots and their lead single `Can't Stop, Won't Stop' got on my nerves more than it was shoved down my throat by MTV and BET. `Tough Luv' does not feature anything too profound and Young Chris carries the group lyrically, but this is still a very solid CD. The production is nice with Chad Hamilton doing the vast majority, but Just Blaze makes a few appearances. Fellow Roc members Beanie Siegel and Jay-Z both are featurued on the album, but neither are amazing. I look forward more to a Young Chris solo next rather than being forced to sit through half a CD of Neef Buck, but `Tough Luv' is a CD that can stay in your rotation for an enjoyable listen every now and then.(3/5 mics)"
3,It's aight,"To be honest I wasn't expecting much from Jay's young protege's but I was very surprised. Although this album thrives off of it's wondeful production, Chris and Neef do bring some lyrical heat. I thought the album lacked originality, they pretty much rep the same things every other rapper does. I think they still have a ways to go before they can proclaim themselves The Future of the R.O.C. The hottest songs are $$$ Girls, Life We Chose, and Look in your Eyes w/ Cam'ron. Otherwise this is a worthy pickup."
5,DA ROC,"YEs it is about time a duo was able to come out on top. Young Gunz will definety hold the ROC down, This CD is every thing i would expect from Rocafella PRobelmz is gonna be a Street anthem!Lyrikai J$B"
3,Average,This is average cd from the young gunz. only reason ppl r giving them 5 stars is because of the production. Nothing new here. Young gunz sound like every other cat on the ROC except kanye. Only songs i listen to are friday night and cant stop wont stop. They arent deep at all....its party music.
1,"Wow, more Boy Band-Pop rap in 2004......great","Wow this is really great, more boy band/pop rap in 2004, exactly what the world needs. I saw the Young Gunz video on TV, the ones where they were cuddeling up with the puppies and I almost lost it. In the last two or three years there has been an increase in cute safe rapppers in love who sing booty songs about girls and look cute for the camera, but it makes me sick that the ROC is jumping on this craze. I guess it makes money.... Will hip hop ever return to the glory days of mid 90's hip hop, because right now it is dead...don't waste your money on this, spend it on the new N'Sync or Da Band album...."
3,Disappointment,"I was disappointed with the young duo from Roc-A-Fella. These guys (especially Young Chris) have impressed my lyrically on almost everything else I've heard them on. Not only was this album not impressive, it was almost, dare I say, bad. I hate to say it cause I love these cats, but this is not a good album. Hopefully they redeem themselves on the next one."
3,not the best,With Jay-Z outta the roc rocafella really needs to step up their game. With kanye signed it looks like rocafellas still in the game but young gunz hardly compares to kanye west. This debut defintely gets old after awhile and for a debut I think they had way too many featured artists. It was a decent cd but i don't think young gunz will go anywhere besides being featured on a lot of songs. I would be suprised if they put out another cd because if they do it's gonna flop. If you like a lot of the stuff the roc does (and im not talking bout kanye or jay-z) then ur prolly gonna like this cd. Its decent but it's no kanye or jay.
4,Great...Just Great,Young Chris and neef with the help of the roc crew make a great debut album...i told ppl the roc has the best artists its true....never take me alive is probably the best song on here.....good album make sure u cop it
3,Tampering With The Original,"""Norma Deloris Egstrom..."" was one of Peggy's best albums, hands-down.A beautifully produced, well-sung collection of songs that whilevery pop-oriented (for the time) fit Peggy like a glove. BUT,several of the songs on this reissue CD are NOT the originalversions. They are alternate takes, that while good, palein comparison to the ones on the original LP. Whether the CD'sproducers didn't realize this, or could not find the originals,or didn't care, this is a rather large disappointment to anyonewho enjoyed the REAL ""Norma, etc."" album back in 1972."
5,Norma Egstrom is Pegg's Last & Best on Capitol.,After Peggy's long bout with Capitol she performed a grand finale of superb jazz oriented tunes backed what sounds like a beautiful orehestra.Her version Song For You is unsurpassed even by McRae or R Charles;the violins & orchestral backing & what sounds like a musical piano metronome behind while she sings in her whistful-mellow way will blow you away. The song Razor is a sequel to her hit Fever is fantastic.There is absolutely not one cut bad on it.Just sit back listen & absorb the rich music.I can remember wearing out the record. Get this;you will not be sorry.
2,CD contains no English,"Fortunately, I checked this one out of the library before buying it. I was expecting some CD's with translations so I can bring with me when I commute to work. The CD's contain Italian only phrases with no translations. You'll be lost without the course book. Not what I was expecting."
1,"Italian Complete Course:Basic-Intermediate, CD Edition","It may or may not be useful for people who want to learn with book and CD, but I wanted something I could learn from driving my car or in the background at home when doing other things. All of the Italian is on the CD's, with no English. So I will probably not learn one word of Italian, and will order a course from the library. For people with time to do concentrated study I understand the economy and efficiency of having only the Italian on CD's, plus you see the spelling in the books. For me it was not the right course."
2,Weakest book in this series I've read so far.,"I don't know whether it was that I had a lot going on while I was trying to read this book (Normally I go through these books in a day or two, this one tok me a week), or if it's just the story that bugged me, but this book is the weakest in this series so far, at least among the books I've read. It seemed like te story was unfocused, and more attention was paid to humorous bits or litle side-tracks than to the actual plot. Add to that a villain who really wasn't very threatening or menacing, and other characters who weren't as interesting as theyusually are in the series, and this book gets a D in my book. Oh well. When you write four books a year in a series, you're bound to have a couple baddies in the bunch. Besides, as I said, it may have been my fault I didn't enjoy the book. In any event, there's my two cents on it."
4,Big Trouble Rocks on Blu-Ray!,"This quirky great/dumb movie really looks and sounds great on Bluray! This movie gets better every time I watch it and Bluray just accentuates that. Great picture quality, interesting commentary track, really good sound--everything you remember PLUS tons of extra clarity because it's HD now! Priced to own by everyone. This is a no brainer!"
4,Most traders can benefit greatly from reading this book,"I read this book quite a while ago but I still remember it's lessons quite well. Joe Ross emphasizes money managment and discipline more than anything else; entries are important but what you do after the trade is perhaps more so.Ross has a very unique style, one which most readers should appreciate. He gives very specific examples of winners and losers, he also analyzes the trades he took for the purpose of writing the book. If I could only read one book on the subject of commodities trading, this one would probably be it. I have read many books and courses, more than 99% of the people out there, I have spent more money on materials than most people put in their trading accounts, so I know what I am talking about. This is an expensive book, but well worth the price."
5,Great history,"Osprey once again has a hit. I reccommend to many looking for a snapshot of a bit of history any Osprey book, For a few dollars you can get a quick peek at a specific subject. This book on US Army in WW1 is a great bit of history with great info, pictures and is very complete for less tahn 50 pages. Definintly an other OSprey book to have for any historian."
4,"Hands down, one of the '90s best rock albums","Ten years later, it still gets better every time I listen to it. Long before it became cool again to like rock and roll because it just kicked [butt], there was Urge. Why they never ruled the universe is still beyond me . . . maybe it was because their music seemed too devoid of the angst, politics, and streetcorner psychoanalysis that rock music needed to make a commercial statement in the 90s?Whatever the reason, it's a true shame that Saturation isn't listed among the great rock albums of the last 25 years. Hot guitar, lyrics that sparkle with wit and sting with irony, and that voice. . . my God, that voice."
4,4 1/2 Stars. Excellent power pop,"Let's face it - Sister Havana is a good enough song that it's worth buying the album just for that one tune, which is what I did, expecting only filler for the remainder of the cd. I was pleasantly surprised and mistaken. This album rocks hard, but with an unique, slightly quirky set of tunes and lyrics. If you combined the Knack and AC/DC, you would end up with Urge Overkill; Saturation is far better than any collection ever recorded by the former group and almost as good as Back in Black by the latter group."
3,this selection is okay.....,"I am a big URGE fan and this albumn is good, but not as good as masters of flavor. It is a little on the soft side, and not as fast paced as their other albumns."
2,Oops,"I meant to buy Massive Attack. (brain flatulence on my part) This album sucks. It's so bad that it's hard to listen to. If you love Urge Overkill, sorry, but... you're ugly."
4,Great Tribute To Rock,"U.O. meant this as a tribute to rock, and they succeeded brilliantly. The songs, mostly hard rock, crunch and shimmy in all the good ways. ""Sister Havana"" and ""Positive Bleeding"" are the two conventional hits, but I also like the sophmoric ""Woman 2 Woman"" and hard rock of ""Crackbabies"" and ""Stalker"". Highly recommended."
3,I Think You'll Be Pleased With This 60's Feature Flick!!!!!,"TV star Brett Halsey is the lead in the inexpensively assembled Girl in Lover's Lane. While drifting through a small town, Bix ( Halsey) becomes involved with local tease Carrie ( Joyce Meadows). Shortly afterward, Carrie is murdered, and Bix is held responsible. The actual killer is feeble-minded Jesse ( Jack Elam), but the villagers aren't as quick on the uptake as the movie audience. Only the intervention of runaway youngster Danny ( Lowell Brown) saves Bix from a lynch mob. Girl in Lover's Lane was directed by another TV habitue, Charles R. Rondeau. -- Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide"
2,Predictable but it moves fast,"I am a fan of low budget films, so I enjoyed this but it isn't a classic. Jack Elam is the best part of the film, that details a experienced and an inexperienced grifter on a 70 minute oddyssey into 'anytown' usa."
2,There's a Hole in My Bucket,"These salt and pepper shakers are pretty much what I expected, plastic shakers to put outside that you can drop and get dirty and not worry about it. For the price, the build quality meets or maybe even exceeds what I would expect.The holes are way too big though. I never understand how companies screw up the size of holes on these shakers. They have one feature they really need to check before they package it and that is the ability to shake salt or pepper out without releasing too much or too little.Too much you say? Make the holes smaller!Too little? Make them larger.Did they even run salt or pepper through these? A LOT comes out. Much more than this salt lover would ever use."
1,Reebok Men's S. Carter Shoes,I returned these for credit because the very small lace eyelets were not right for the very wide laces. I have already rated these before.
3,You Can Believe What You Want,"but it doesn't change the truth. Unless you believe the teacher lied (and I have never heard that suggested or demonstrated) you have no basis for an assumption that Farnsworth did not invent the essential element of electronic tv. And Sarnoff, as well as Zworykin, are known to have (to be polite) exaggerated their deeds and discoveries."
3,Slow moving book that never goes that far...,"""Tirra Lirra by the River"" is the story of a woman, Nora, who grows up in the 1910s with tales of Camelot and knights and such, and she goes off and becomes married, and then as years go by, she realizes it a mistake, and runs away and becomes divorced. Friends go mad, some commit suicide, and Nora ages to her 70s where she finally goes home to find that much has changed. Kinda feminist story, but there's just something missing here."
3,Amazon's description is inaccurate,"The plot synopsis for this product says that this set includes 4 episodes from the 1980's televison series, including Man from the South. This was the reason I purchased this set.I was disappointed to find there are no episodes from that series in this set. This set is exclusively early movies Hitchcock directed, including from the silent era.While they are good movies, and certainly interesting from the perspective of studying the great director as a young filmmaker, I was unhappy Amazon did nothing to rectify their mistake, and still hasn't changed their product description."
3,Doesn't fit all Revere Ware 2-quart pots,This lid did not fit my Revere Ware 2-quart copper-bottom saucepan. My pot needs a 6-inch lid and this one is 7-inches wide.
5,Just what I needed,"Broke the knob off my saucepan lid. Knob alone was not available. Since this was one of my favorite saucepans for cooking, I was delighted to find this replacement lid. It works perfectly."
1,disappointing!,"The battery I received from Best Deal Supply was not the battery shown on the order page. It is a black and silver Energizer (nowhere does it say lithium)and was shipped in a manila envelope, not an individual package. So far they have not agreed to take it back."
2,Brain Elevate,"I ordered the ""brain-elevate"" supplement to take in combination with other supplements. I haven't found it to have a particularly noticeable effect on my cognitive abilities, but I have only been taking 1 capsule/day, so I might try a higher dosage to see what happens then. I would recommend trying it out for yourself, but don't expect miraculous results."
5,Increase Your Confidence,"The Toy and Game Inventor's Handbook gave me instant erudition about the arcane world of marketing and licensing inventions. Thanks to this book I have more poise, confidence and a sense of security when I approach potential licensees.Before you buy this book, get a few highlighters because you will want to mark all the gems of knowledge the authors unselfishly share with readers.RozHarrisburg, PA"
1,The Toy and Game Inventor's Handbook,"After I read this book, I still had no idea where to start. All I would like to do is find a good company, that can make my toy. It is so hard to find any prototype companies without selling you hard. This book had lots of great history and idea's of other toy inventors that made it, but nothing that really helped me start from square one. This book just gives advice an old histroy of toys. Is there actually a book out there that can start you from square one, instead of feeding you toy history and other stuff I don't care to waste my time reading? No one ever talks about square one after you get an idea. What was the very first thing a toy inventor did with their idea? No sugar coding, just the very first thing to get it made?"
1,"Dry, slow and dull","This book is dry, slow, and dull. It has some (possibly) useful information here and there, but you'll never get to it without falling asleep first or possibly skipping over it in your haste get to the next chapter. Most of the first few chapters talk about people who are cooler than you. Gee don't you wish you were cool? You can be, too! The rest of the book goes on to list things that you either:a) already knowb) could have found on GoogleIf you don't know how to make toys and games this book will not tell you how. If you are making games and/or already know how, then this book will bore you to tears.If you can get a used copy for cheap, I'd say go for it. Otherwise it's two thumbs down."
3,"Okay, but...","I wasn't terribly impressed with this, considering his supposed standing as a scholar and historian. The first hundred or so pages regarding the Battle of Salamis and Solon's early notions of democracy are engaging, but the author soon settles into rather sweeping assertions that become less and less rooted in historical examples. He may very well be right about it all, and probably is, but posits far too little to support his observations on particularly art and literature as a reflection of the concrete belief in democracy that Athens had and others didn't. He writes well (rather it is well-translated), just found myself wishing for more meat and less gristle. Still and all, there's much to learn from it and it is an entertaining read."
4,Fine History of a Fifth Century Athens,"At the end of the third chapter I agreed very much with the criticisms of the reviewer from Brooklyn above. Meier does make some very abstract sociological arguments in his chapter on ""the Greek Way,"" and they also made me uneasy. But the many chapters that follow elaborate on them in quite concrete ways and the book becomes sufficiently grounded in details to satsify me thoroughly. I particularly enjoy Meier's comments on the great tragedies when he arrives at the year of their original performances in Athens' amazing century."
3,toiling in the shadow of history,"Meier is toiling in dark shadows here, since Athens as a subject has engaged the lavish attentions of some of the greatest scholars of the last two hundred years. As a good, readable introduction to the city's crucial decades, this is a book to be recommended. It's solid and workmanlike, but there's something to be said for that..."
4,An overall good release from Nuwine,"Recorded on Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Records, Nuwine delivers a relatively good batch of God-oriented but still ghetto rap tunes. There are too many skits on the album and there are a few stupid songs [like ''Hell''], But otherwise, The album's fun and has some good west coast-style beats. ''One Million Souls'', ''Revelation'', ''Player'', and especially ''Lunchbox'' [A very energetic track and the best one on the album] are the highlights of this album. Nuwine isn't really the best lyricist i've heard [As evidenced by the lyrics inside the cd booklet], But, If his cool southern voice is put over the right kind of beat, It could make for some pretty entertaining music. I reccomend this to fans of Scarface, 2Pac, and C-Murder. Hope the review helped. Be blessed."
1,more like a houseshoe than a boot,I ordered three pair of these for family members. We thought that they were attractive for outer wear - with jeans. They were short and the top appears to be made of foam rubber covered with fabric - very flimzy - below average quality. At this price - not a bargain - more like a house shoe - klm from Texas
4,A rocking we will go,This is what I had been looking for and also looking for a great deal on it. The pick works great.
4,"Four and One-Half Pineapples, I Mean Stars","I find myself in between four and five on this book. It easily would have been five, had the author not drifted so much in telling us about her world travels and daily excursions. Maybe it's just a male thing, though.The culture of the pineapple discovered by this world traveler are fascinating and informative. Being crazy for pineapple, I enjoyed very much hearing about its beginnings and spreading thorughout the tropics and sub-tropical regions.The insights about medicinal, spritual, fabrics and ornamental are most interesting. The recipes are solid, unique and the color photographic displays of food groupings are nicely done. Interested in more recipes, see Norm VanAken's ""The Great Exotic Fruit Book"" and his wonderful ""New World Cuisine.""Long live the King of Fruit!"
3,Are the Pearls Grade B or Grade A? Clarify!,"I gave 3 stars because I do not know what grade of pearls these are.The description starts by saying the pearls are Grade B. But it ends by saying they are Grade A. The seller, American Pearl, needs to clarify - in every case where these pearls are offered for sale on Amazon.com - what the actual Grade is.Thanks."
2,"Insufficient, out of date; a poor buy",We used this book and also the Lonely Planet Spain guide together for 2 walks in Galicia. In both cases (Spindrift 2 and Mt Pindo) the information was out of date. The maps were just detailed enough to give us false confidence and we were misdirected both times. The recommended menu selection in the recommended restaurant in Camelle was awful.This is a poor buy. Suggest you use the Spain book and get local topographic maps.
5,Wake people this is cool!!!,"The Rakes are one of the best recent British bands. They blitzed into LA late last year and took the city by storm. They have brilliant songs like ""Strasbourg"" and ""22 Grand Job."" Their songs are about everyday and ordinary things. One of the best songs here is ""Retreat."" The remix is amazing too. There are some intense songs like ""Open Book"" and ""The Guilt."" They have some more dub reggae moments like in ""Violent."" The Rakes are hard to pin down. The mix all the best genres of music and create their own deal. This record has been released in England a while ago. They have conquered Europe. They are one of the bands ready to take over in America. This new American release includes the new song ""All Too Human."""
3,Loads of Fun,"I saw GSW live, and then bought this album - I highly recommend both the album and seeing them live! Lots of energy. A great pick-me-up. This is certainly their best album (and this coming from a former DJ). If you like Spin Doctors, you'll love GSW - they're much better than Spin Doctors although along the same lines."
5,Confused by religious apparitions? This book is for you...,"If you find yourself not knowing what to believe and what not to believe this book can help.The always articulate Father Benedict J. Groeschel, C.F.R. offers an excellent examination of how the faithful should approach extraordinary religious experiences such as New Age encounters and the reported Marian apparations at Medjugorje.Groeschel offers practical steps for how the faitful are to evaluate such claims and summarizes the Church's teachings on private revelation.Groeschel uses Saint Therese of Liseux who offers an example of a humble and prayerful approach to life which will lead the reader to discern God's presence in their life."
3,"Warning, does not work with new 3850 model","We have been using this cable with our 3650 model systems to connect to a gps unit for data collection and for syncronizing out in the field with NT systems and it works great for that. However, we got some new 3850 ipaqs, and they have changed the connector, so it does not work with 3850, so just be forwarned!"
1,Skip This One...,"I have to echo the opinions of several previous reviewers who pointed out how far-fetched and unbelievable this plot was. Even if you suspend belief enough to buy the Shellagh-ma-gig, why is Meg so afraid to tell Sax about it? How could she think he would actually believe that she ""forced"" him into marrying her by wishing on a statue? Good grief! Plus the Grandmother is way over the top while being a cardboard character - we never really understand her motivations. If it weren't for Sax (and the rating system), I wouldn't have given this book even one star. Ironically, I read this book based on the opinion of a reviewer at a romance novel website. She considered it a ""Desert Isle Keeper"". I wonder, did she read the same book I did?!"
3,"Too much exposition, too little romance","As a huge fan of Jo Beverley's, I was quite disappointed in Forbidden Magic. Beverley has a tendency of late to spend too much time in one character's POV (in this case, Meg's) and too little in the other main character's. While I can appreciate Beverley's desire to make Sax something of a mystery, by the end of the book, I wasn't really sure why he fell so hard for Meg. And if Meg thought ""I've got to get the sheelagh back"" once, she thought it a hundred times. At one point I put the book down and said, ""All right, Jo, I GET IT!"" I was also disappointed that after building a great deal of sexual tension between Meg and Sax, there wasn't much of a payoff for the reader. I hope Beverley returns to form in her next Malloren novel and gives a better balance between hero and heroine POV."
1,Disappointing,"I give this book one star only because of the following few good points: (1) Sax is extremely handsome and falls head over heals for ""plain"" Meg; (2) Sax has a soft heart and loves his pet who has a deformed mouth and employs servants who have physical or other problems.I can think of nothing more that is positive about this story. When the characters finally have sex (I can't construe it as making love), it is accompanied by ridiculously inane conversation. With about 40 pages to go, I cared so little for the characters that I put the book down, will never finish it, and have not the slightest curiosity regarding its ending.For beautiful stories with well-developed plots and characters, read the author's _The Shattered Rose_, _Dark Champion_, and _Lord of Midnight_."
5,up to this author's usual high standards,"Highly original historical with magical statue that kicks off the romance. A great parrot and dog, eccentric household and hero plus lots of humor and plot twists. One of a kind; not part of a series."
2,Not my cup of tea,"While I found parts of the story here and there to be interestingI didn't particularly enjoy the book. The plot wasn't developedenough, nor were the characters in the book. And I found theheroines repeated thoughts over whether the earl was mad to betiresome, also her guilty thoughts that she had somehow ""forced""the earl to marry her because of the sheelagh-ma-gig to beridiculous. He married her because he made quick decisions, shedidn't have any magic power over him. She should loosen up andenjoy life and knock off the guilt trips."
2,Doesn't Quite Work for Me,"I was given a different brand of Melatonin called Nature's Bounty Maximum Strength 10 mg in the hospital after back surgery. I wasn't sure if it worked the way it should because it took an hour before I'd fall asleep, I'd be asleep for 5 hours and then have a hard time returning to sleep. When I was discharged my husband purchased this item, Vitamin Shoppe 3 mg Melatonin.Vitamin Shoppe 3 mg doesn't keep me asleep. I am drowsy 1 hour after taking it but I am awake 2 hours later and I'm up every 2 hours throughout the night. When I took 2 3 mg pills of Vitamin Shoppe Melatonin I still woke up every 2 hours, the only difference is that I was more tired. I won't try 3 pills."
1,Looks better on-line-ouch!,"I got this hitch cover and i thought it was a metal bass or fish and it was solid. NOT TRUE, it was thin metal with a black plastic base it is attached to. Doesn't look like the picture here. It has a black plastic outline of about 1/16 inch. Wish i would have know it was thin tin type metal."
3,Good but some code problems....,I will say upfront that I have only just started using this book.But it doesn't take long to realise that at least some of the code has NOT been bug tested (or tested to see if it even works).Specifically (so far) the Thayer encryption routine (doesn't work - had to download an alternative) and the Getfile routine (locks up after multiple uses).Will post a further review if matters change for better (or worse).The book still has a good layout and has lots of useful routines for everyone just dont expect them to work without a little 'tweaking'.
4,Well spent money,For a beginner or a intermediate user this book is definitely a must have. It contains a lot of useful codes that are commented and easy to understand. For the advanced user there isn't much to get. If you consider the fact that there are 11 authors to this book then the book seems to be a bit thin. I had hoped for much more code. The language can sometimes be a bit confusing: The code analasys is sometimes more difficult to understand than the code itself.
2,Horrible balance,"Good things first. Very well finished, very shiny, decent proportions (teaspoon bowl touch too big but at least it's not super long and big like many contemporary sets - what are people doing with these monster teaspoons beats me).They are heavy, and I think essentially unbendable. But there is one fatal flaw related to heft. The weight is all in end of the handle. You can't normally lift them without them violently swinging up. There is no way they will stay on plate if the handle extends a little bit past the edge. They are also too thick to be comfortable to hold.Last but not least Amazon lists them as made in Korea, but they are made in China."
2,Uncomplicated,"If you like your western straight-forward and predictabe, and the writing simpistic and uncomplicated, well then this is the Slocum for you. It's not that it's bad, it's just that it's not very good. In this Slocum, he rides into town to help out a friend from his Quantrill days who is in a range war. And you know how it ends--the opposing side from the ranch the Sixgun, bites the dust and winds up in the cemetery, hence Sixgun Cemetery. About as simple as they get, but a quick read if you just want to kill a couple of hours. Not many pages, and you won't need a dictionary."
2,Far from his best,"For years I have bought every novel Dick Francis has written and was disappointed with only one. Now there are two. This collection contains what appear to be magazine short stories. There is virtually no character development and not much plot development either. This is obviously not Francis' genre. Approach this one with caution, for most of the things you like most about his novels are missing from his short stories. Very disappointing!"
5,for Dick Francis fans,"this is keeping with his style (or hers, as he claimed after his wife Mary passed away that she wrote all his books, but swore him to secrecy, perhaps they collaborated, or maybe not) - in short-story format for short time-frame reading (doctor office, etc.)- or read it all at once! each story had the rich characterizations I've enjoyed, with sufficient twists in the plot to keep you guessing"
5,Top of his field,"I have purchased and read (many times over) every Dick Francis story ever written and published. I've stood in line to have his books autographed and noencounter with him - in person or in print has ever disappointed. This collection of short stories is no exception. The genre can be difficult and is not suited for everyone, but Mr. Francis does his usual grand job and I loved every minute!"
5,Pretty darn good!,"This is the very first Dick Francis book I've ever read, recommended to me by my father. I certainly have enjoyed the flow of the characterizations, plots, and twists. The short stories are reminiscent of the Hitchcockian type plots. Slime deserves slime. After having read these stories, I am now anxious to read a novel of his. I give it a thumbs up and recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the Hitchcock Mystery Magazine short stories."
1,Dick Francis not at his best?,"The first Dick Francis I could put aside, go to sleep and continue reading the next day."
5,"Thieves, snobs, and greed","This volume of 13 shorter stories is a good introduction to the author if you have not read his novels. The stories are varied, but all set around racetracks. They are mostly English settings, with a couple in the U.S. Thieves range from a horse doper to a sleazy crooked attorney. There are many cases of misplaced trust, and a question is raised in one story - who would you trust, a man selling horses or an attorney?On the side, you will learn a lot about English steeplechase racing. The characters range from horse owners, trainers, and jockeys, to writers, con men, and even a tramp. You must be careful who you are unkind to. There are varying forms of revenge. Some people are hoisted on their own petards, and some escape justice because of the mischance of others."
1,13 Reasons Not To Read this Book,"If you type in ""Field of 13"" in Amazon you get about 20 books from the US Department of the Interior talking about grassland studies and the effectiveness of different pesticides. If I were you I would pick one of those documents over this book. It really is that bad, I almost thought I saw this as an episode of Simon and Simon - quick, easy plot that takes no brain power at all to comprehend. To be fair I only got to page 100 so maybe it did a 180 and got better but I doubt it."
3,Mr. Francis' short stories are a bit bleak for my taste.,"Dick Francis does not write short stories that are as satisfying as his novels; plots and writing style are recognizably Francis, but cynacism and darkness are much more evident here than in his novels and do not leave the reader with the same sense of appreciation. ""Field of Thirteen"" is worth reading until a new novel appears, but I hope Mr. Francis will spend his writing talent in the future only on novels - MANY novels!"
2,Normally sure footed D Francis shin splints in Field of 13.,"The first furlongs of Dick Francis' short stories' grab the reader's attention much as the announcer's ""They're off"" at the race track. However, unlike the novels he writes with stamina and heart enough to hold the reader's attention until the last lap, Francis' short stories are reminiscent of the quick burst of a grand horse who shin splints and falls short of the finish line leaving the fans saddened by the loss."
3,Lists helpful resources,"Con: Contents are presented in a ""textbook-y"" way, making it seem less personal, abstract, and redundant.Pro: Lists additional books, websites, movies, and other helpful resources related to the chapter material."
5,Definite 5 stars! A must-have parenting book.,"I've always wondered what really matters in helping to raise my children be successful as well as have strong character. Well, I no longer have to wonder. This book is absolutely wonderful! It's packed full of great but realistic ideas that I know will help me be a better parent."
4,Very practical information,"The book has very practical suggestions for seven very specific skills that Dr. Borba thinks are foundational for kids to develop in order that they may succeed in all areas of life - now and in the future.I love practical parenting books, that verse not only on great parenting principles, but also on practical tools to apply in your every day life as a parent. It's the sort of book that might be good to have a reference and to re-read specific chapters as your kids grow and encounter different challenges and obstacles. It's very practical and down to earth."
2,Common Sense,"I bought this book in hopes to provide some insight in raising a self-confident daughter. With all the problems and pressures facing young girls today, I thought the more I know the better prepared I will be. The good thing about this book is it made me feel like a stellar parent. It was really common sense! Things like don't label your child such as ""clumsy"" or don't compare your child to their siblings. If you are intentional in raising your child already then this book is a bust and does not provide any insight. If you are worried about your parenting style, or grew up in a bad household and fear making the same mistakes, then this book may prove more helpful."
4,Good for parent,I haven't finish it yet. It seems to be easy to understand and practice. But I am not sure if it effect every type of child.
5,I love paperblanks,"I love paperblanks unique style,my dayplanner and journals are always a paperblanks product. The embellished manuscript is beautiful and makes a great gift to a Mozart fan."
1,Terrible DVD,"This video was awful. From the incessant snapping to the arrogant attitude to the fact that this is not really a workout, but a bunch of moving in place (it seems), I turned it off. Wish I hadn't wasted my money."
2,Disappointing.,You will need a lot of room to do the exercises. I didn't think the video was very challenging and that I got a good workout.
2,video quality very poor,"its a real nice workout - different and refreshing, but the video quality is so poor I dont do it.I cant replace it because I live out US"
3,Funny dress,"I like the movement in this tape. I just can't understand why J Kries has to wear a curtain below her waist. It's hard to see how she moves behind a piece of black cloth. If she is too shy to show her legs, she can wear a longer pants."
3,For Advanced/Knowledgeable Dancers Only...NO BACK PROBLEMS!,"The routines in this video are for those who have an intermediate knowledge of dance terminology, so if you have never taken lessons before, you may not understand what the narrator is talking about. It does NOT take into account that all the bending-while-stretching excercises may NOT be good for those with any type of back problems. In other words, if you've had back problems in the past, as I have, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DO ALL OF THE ROUTINES! I appreciated the lack of techno-irritating type music a lot of these videos contain. But if you don't like bongo or drums, you will not like the background beat. The first routine made me feel very stretched-out, strong and relaxed without feeling too over-excercised. But after the first routine, I could not possibly have done the second and third right away. All in all, pretty advanced."
4,A nice change,"This is a nice change from all your normal workouts. It isn't at all trendy dance but modern jazz and ballet. The first workout is the longest, and I have only done it once or twice because I found it a little boring. (Too much stretching without enough dancing) The second wourkout is about 20 minutes, and is one of the funnest workouts I have done, which is saying something. I always break a sweat very quickly, but in the first I barely sweat at all. The third workout is a cool down that is based on yoga, but since I personally am not in to yoga I haven't done it."
5,What a fun workout!,"I have a few of Jennifer Kries videos so thought I would try this one and I really enjoy it. Although, it's not for beginners. It helps if you watch it a few times before actually doing it and if you have a dance background. After doing each segment, I feel as though I got a good workout. If you like to rotate through workout videos, this one is a fun and challenging change."
4,Liked the second one better,"I have dance experience and I found the second workout more fun because of its jazz-like moves. The camera man must really like the drummer, which was frustrating at first not to see the instructor in the first workout. I usually just do the second one, since I like it better."
3,Hard to follow,"I do think both dance instructors are very incredible and talented people - but I found the dance moves hard to follow. At critical times, the camera would cut away to the musicians or show their heads instead of their feet. I also did not feel like the cardio workout was anything close to Jazzercise. They also switched to barefeet and shoes and back to barefeet without giving me any clues to what I should be doing. Because it was so hard to follow, I never feel like I get a workout physically, just mentally. I did enjoy the music and if I could follow the routines, I think they would be cool. RATS."
4,Recommended!,"I have no dance experience so I was bit hesitant about buying this video. I have no regrets after using it for 3 months. It takes a couple of tries before you get the hang of the movements but once you do, you feel energized, toned and great! I usually do the first workout the first day (takes about 35 minutes) and do the second (takes about 25 minutes) on the following day and keep cycling it until the weekend comes around when I do the whole tape from start to finish."
1,Too much for a beginner,This tape would probably be O.K. for an intermediate dancer but it is not suited for a beginner. It is too complicated. Please be careful if you don't dance much or are not gifted with grace and timing!
4,Great workout and fun...,"This workout was (for me) on level with the Tae Bo basic workout, but it was alot more fun. I felt like rather than just going through the motions to complete an excersize, I was actually dancing. I'm not the most coordinated of people and have never taken any dance classes, so it will take me a while to get all of the moves down. I felt a little silly at first due to my lack of coordination, but I think this will be a tape that I enjoy and stick with.My only complaint about this tape was the way the camera kept panning the room or sliding to someone besides the instructor. I would just start getting the foot moves when the camera would pan somewhere else and I'd lose it. Despite this minor frustration, however, I think this is a good buy."
1,Never again!,The most annoying part of this video is the instruction; after 15 minutes I could not stand to listen to it anymore. Being shouted out over the drums was more than I could take after a long day at work! The drumming is repetitive enough to be tedious & irritating although the music is more pleasant in the second half. There is nothing aesthetically pleasing about this video and the instruction is not as helpful as it could be. Definitely won't be trying it again!
2,lisa wheeler saves the day,the first dance section by jennifer kries is nonsense - neither a workout nor my idea of dance. lisa leads a nice second dance section - enjoyable and a mild workout. followed by a relaxing stretch again led by lisa. i like the music. unless you are fairly well-coordinated and a beginner to workouts this tape is not effective. the second and third sections are fun to do.
3,The Sound track on this film is simply awful.,"The Sound track on this film is simply awful! I can't understand it. Every aspect of it is superior to the other version that is available except the sound track. The sound levels are all over the place from moment to moment. Whole chunks of dialogue are missing as Boyer's voice disappears for brief moments. This is a great and outrageous distraction. This more expensive version sounds as if it was recorded in a tin cup. I saw the other version, the $12.99 version, and don't remember its sound track being as bad as it is here. The things that bother me about that version were the poor picture quality and the badly placed, frequently off the screen, subtitles. This version is better in those qualities in every way, but the sound track is awful. Other than the bad sound track, this is a well-acted and superior historical romance with a tragic ending."
3,not very satisified with purchase,"this cassettee was not clear and sharp as i was led to belive citing a ""new video of mayerling "" this copy is no better than one i bought a few years ago from notorious ""e bay ""sub titles sink below the television picture so losing a lot of story line . so in all, very disapointedsorryto have to state this but you asked my opinion"
3,DOES IT ALWAYS HAS TO END WITH A BULLET!!!!!,"I always wanted to see this version after having seen the 1969 remake.It was quite good i thought,Charles Boyer was very good as the tortured monarch and Danielle Darrieux looked very virginal indeed but probably not as breathtaking as Catherine Deneuve was in the later version. Not a masterpiece but a valuableexample of vintage French cinema..."
3,My grandson enjoyed the book.,"My grandson enjoyed the book very much. He especially likes the author, Michael Morpurgo and his works. He is a very avid reader. Little Foxes is a very good book."
2,Powerbuilt 648796 Honda Crankcase Pulley Removal Tool,"I used this tool to no avail. There were two of us. One holding the Crankcase pulley removal Tool and another trying to loosen the crankshaft pulley bolt. Due to the sloppy fit of the Crankcase pulley removal tool, it slipped and chipped my crankshaft pulley. Cost me an additional $95 + $20 shipping for a used Cranshaft Pulley."
5,BEYOND (f-ing) PERFECT!!,"THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!! You made my life A LOT easier, and saved me atleast two days time trying to get a 'nut off' lol. ....THANK YOU!"
4,Not really needed if you have a good air compressor,"If you are changing the timing belt with hand tools this is a must. If you are using decent quality air tools (IR, etc..) Don't both you won't need this unless you are working on a vehicle that has spent it's life upnorth"
4,Did the trick!,"Like some others had said, the fit was a little loose in my pulley socket hole too, so I wrapped the bit in some duct tape to give a more snug fit. It's a very well made and solid tool tho, solid, had the pulley bolt out with two 450mm breaker bars and a jack stand. Awesome. Recommend to anyone who wants to do their Honda Cam Belt."
2,Did not fit on 1997 Honda Prelude,"I purchased the item to tighten my 1997 Honda Prelude's crank pulley. When I received the item it looked well designed. As I start to work on my car (jack up car, take off wheel) I notice that the crank pulley tool was too big to fit in there. I was thinking maybe there was a certain way to use it, but there was simply no way it would fit in the crank pulley. I was disappointed in the tool as I needed my crank pulley tightened to torque spec. I also made sure from their list of cars that this would fit on my car. Be careful as this will not fit on all the cars listed."
5,Worked as it should,"Worked exactly as it should. I have used this and another brand in the past. This unit held up perfectly. Even my 800ft/lb titanium 1/2"" gun couldnt take the bolt off, just spun the crank, this guy did the trick. Be ready for a lot of force."
5,Works as advertised - Civic EX 2001,"Used on my civic 2001 EX for the timing belt replacement. Fit exactly as it should in the crankcase. Used to two breaker bars, one to hold it in place, on to actually turn the crankcase. Man it took an incredible amount of force to loosen that bolt. The crankcase tool held and worked as advertised."
1,Honda Crankcase Tool,This tool proved very hard to use. I had to result to a different method to get the bolt off after close to an hour of attempting to use this tool. Needless to say that unless you have another person holding the tool in place while you loosen the crank shaft bolt.I do not recommend this tool. There is a much better designed tool in Amazon.
3,must need tool?,"Yes, this tool is needed to actually work on a Honda, but it was nearly impossible to have this tool stay still in order to keep the crank in place and loosen the bolt. Very frustrating."
4,Does what it says...,"Literally, it does what it says. We had an old honda that needed a timing belt and couldn't get the crank bolt to break loose...Broke 2 snap on ratchets.Quick shipping, delivered in new condition."
5,Great quality - this is what you want for the modern Honda V6 crank pulley,"I didn't want to fool around with shadetree mechanic tricks of getting the crankshaft bolt loose and getting the harmonic balancer off. I also didn't want to pay $$$$$ for the special Honda tool that essentially includes this tool with the handle bar. You can use your 1/2"" flex head or go buy one at Harbor Freight for less than $20 if you are cheap. Grab a piece of 1"" black iron pipe to go over the handle and you're cooking.Spend the $26 and get this versus taking a chance on ruining your engine."
5,Needed tool for Honda maintenance,Even with this crank socket I ended having to use 2 breaker bars with cheater extensions for more leverage. Those Honda workers must have had a 11 setting on their impact gun the day my car came down the line!
3,Well worth the value,"Invaluable for replacing the timing belt on Hondas, Previous effort with my civic was a nightmare. I had to find someone with a powerful enough impact gun after mine failed to get the crank pulley bolt loose. Recently did my sons Acura and this tool was the perfect key. Couple breaker bars and extensions, Jack stand as fulcrum point and a piece of pipe and the bolt broke loose nicely. The only way to go!"
5,Great!,This product works perfectly and the price was perfect. It is Comparable to tools costing up to four times as much!
1,Buy local if you really need it!,"Ordered this tool for my upcoming timing belt job on my '98 Civic along with the t-belt kit, thermostat, etc. Very disappointed to say that I didn't received this tool with my order and it shows as shipped and received. Everything else came as described. Not so much a review of the tool but of amazon's service...looks like I'll be sourcing one of these locally. I need to get this job done so I'll be paying for two of these tools, one from amazon which I never recieved and one from a local brick and mortar.As an update I contacted amazon and they shipped the tool and should be here in 2 business days. I received another email stating that if I didn't return the original item I paid for (which I never received, that was the point of them sending the item now!) that I would be charged for the tool and shipping ALL OVER AGAIN. Haven't figured out how to return something I never received. Customer service is great, I PAY TWICE FOR ONE ITEM! Good work amazon."
1,Flimsy product,its better to get a double impact air hammer that is rated above 650lbs of tq.this item when wedge against the chassis tends to move around and will marr the corners of the crank pulley.
3,Great tool....but it contains LEAD,"This tool works like a charm....For the Tool: 1/2"" breaker bar with cheater pipe, backed up on the floor with blocks of wood and worn brake padsFor the Bolt: 19mm socket with 3/4"" drive, 16"" extension with 3/4"" breaker bar 3' cheater pipe and a jack standIt was loose in one solid pull :), but alas there is a Drawback in that this tool CONTAINS LEAD and needs to be handled accordingly. Usage of gloves or frequent washing of hands is advised.This tool would have been equally effective if it was made of chrome/vanadium plated iron and i would have gladly paid a little more to not have ""hazardous"" metal in my house.BTW almost all ALLTRADE tools CONTAIN LEADYOU ARE WARNED"
3,well it works....,I cant brag about this tool by no means cause it will take more than one person to do a simple job like remove a crank pulley. The depth of the crank pulley on most hondas is not deep enough for this tool to set firmly inside without falling due to gravity. It was necessary to remove my crank in order to change my timing belt so a job that looks easy turned into an all day event. The concept of the tool is on point but maybe add magnets to help hold in place or change the design to prevent the tool from falling out on its own. VERY FRUSTRATING!!!!!
3,Tool,Hope to use this in near future. Needed this tool to break free the crank shaft nut to replace timing belt.
5,Works great,This tool is well worth the price in time and trouble it'll save you from struggling with removing crank pulley.
3,Ummm.......it works,"Ok,It gets the job done. Have a good sized breaker bar ready to attach to this (1/2"" drive). You are better off with an impact gun."
3,Integra - Not perfect but got the job done,"Got the job done using this tool. Had a tendency to want to slip off the crank pulley, but I was able to wedge it with a breaker bar against the floor. Once I got that setup it worked fine."
3,Honda Crankcase Pulley Removal Tool,"The socket does not fit well enough in the pulley hole to stay securely engaged while torque is being applied. It got the job done but only after several faled attempts when it would fall out of the hole in the pulley. Possibly if another person were available to help by holding the attached breaker bar it would have got the job done quicker, but it did finally engage and hold long enough to break the bolt loose. The socket is very robust and I did not sense any problem with flexing or other undesirable traits while resisting a torque of around 400 lb-ft. I gave it three stars primarily because of the sloppy fit."
5,Works perfectly.,"When trying to remove my crank pulley, I first attempted to use a wrench the braces itself against the teeth on your flywheel, while you reef on the bolt holding your crank pulley. I broke the wrench. It was complete piece of garbage.Then I bought this tool, and the bolt came out easily. You can use this to hold your crank still while you take the bolts out of your flywheel too. However, that took 2 guys for me, cause then your breaker bars have to be about 2 feet apart."
5,Gets the job done,If you are looking for a crankcase pulley look no further!!! This is the tool! Well worth the price!!1
5,Couldn't Have Done It Without This,"There was no way to get the crankshaft pulley off my Insight with regular hand tools. Even impact wrenches failed from what I read on the web. Honda dissuades them. Everyone urged, get this tool. Did the trick effortlessly: combined the tool, mounted inside the pulley, attached to a 2' breaker bar secured against the garage floor plus a 3' breaker bar and 19mm six-sided socket. The bolt came free with a startling bang. Borrowed the breaker bars from a national auto parts chain. Easy to put the bolt back on that requires a 90 degree tightening after torqued to the pulley. Just get this tool if you are seriously considering doing it yourself."
5,Must have tool for your Honda.,"This reasonably priced tool is well worth the purchase price. This simple tool will make removing the crank pulley simple and save time. There are other methods of removing the pulley, but too often people mistakenly use ineffective methods that damage the brittle crank pulley, like chains. This inexpensive tool prevents that and enables you to remove it per the instructions from Honda. Keep in mind, you still may need a 6' length of pipe for leverage, but this tool is an absolute MUST HAVE for any Honda owner that does their own work."
1,DOES NOT FIT,"as per the packaging and advertisement, this tool is supposedly a perfect fit for 1992 and up Honda Preludes. DOES NOT FIT in between the sub frame and crank pulley in my 1997 prelude, had to hack mine down to almost half its original width, and went through four hacksaw blades. works now, but one star is all I can give this item."
5,Worked perfectly,"Used this on my AP1 S2000 as part of a supercharger installation. You'll need this tool and a 1/2"" drive breaker bar to secure it to hold the crank pulley still while you remove the pulley bolt. For the bolt, I used another 1/2"" drive socket and breaker bar, and about 4' of cheater pipe. It took a lot of pulling (and faith that the breaker bars would hold) but the bolt came free without any issues.This tool performed as expected, and is ~$100 cheaper than the OEM equivalent. Highly recommended."
4,Nice Tool,"This tool is a ""Must have"" when dealing with that nasty crank pulley bolt.It does have a little play/slop when trying to hold it on the pulley and an extra set of hands help."
4,nice tool,Works well to help you remove the crank pulley on Hondas and Acuras. The fit on my '97 Integra crank pulley seems a bit loose but does not pose a problem. Use of a couple large breaker bars is recommended. You can also use this tool to rotate the crank even after loosening and removing the crank pulley bolt.
2,Honda Crank Pulley Removal tool,"Tool was fine however I ordered it overnight express because I needed it asap and 3 days later it hadn't even left the warehouse. So I called amazon and they said they would refund the shipping price and ship it out overnight the next day, two days later or so it went out and showed up 3 or 4 days later after that. I called the shipping agency and they said it had not been shipped overnight but instead had been shipped standard, that was important as I was waiting on the particular car to be ready. I would have picked somewhere else to buy from if I had known overnight would turn into a week +."
2,Product needs to be fixed,"First off, don't be scared away from this review... if you have to DIY the timing belt then get it. You have to have one of these to keep the crank from turning while you loosen the crank bolt. However, there is so much slop the part that you will pull your hair out getting the thing set up because it will fall out of the pulley everytime unless you hold everything in place while you begin loosening or tightening the crank bolt. Very unnecessary and annoying considering it's just a bad job manufacturing the dimension. I wrapped a run of electrical tape around it to thicken it up and make it hold a little better. So there's a tip.And a PROTIP for anyone what works for powerbuilt reads this, please see if you can change the dimensions. FYI, I used it for a 3.2L '05 Acura TL."
1,Incorrect tool for listed vehicle,"I would give it 0 stars, but i am required to put at least 1. This pulley tool is not the correct tool for 1995 Civic 1.6L. The description said it would work on that car, and also on the packaging but the tool did not fit. Now I can return it on amazon, but for 50%?? Not happening. Ill sell it on Craigslist for 20 bucks."
2,No Value,"These blank dvds are giving me such a headache. Some would record and some wouldnt. I tried these because it was dubbed the best blank media...NOT !!! I've had more success with Verbatim. So, from now on I will use Verbatim DVD Rs."
2,80% Verification failure rate,I've been burning DVDs for at least 5 years. I've had pretty good results with Imation and TDK media but I thought I'd try Taiyo based on the hype I read. I now believe it was just that... hype. I've burned 10 movies on these DVDs and only 2 passed the verification step at the end of the burning process. Who knows if they will play. I don't have time to sit and watch them to find out. I guess it's back to TDK or Imation.
1,Terrible Quality Go with Verbatim,"I backed up a 2 DVD movies with 2 of these ""value line discs""and both kept freezing and were giving me glitches, I backed up both againwith Verbatim 8x DVD+R and both played fine . THEY ARE CALLED VALUE LINE FOR A REASON !Dont waste your money on these they aren't even worth returning"
1,100 Coasters,"I have not had a single one of these discs burn right. Also, the inner hub code shows that these are 4x discs, not 8x. Another problem (which may relate to the burn issues) is many of the discs (well, most of them) have small cracks on the inner hub."
5,"So far, so good...","My burning software actually writes to these DVDs faster than a stack of Memorex's I had used previously. I've only used 13 of them so far, but all of them burned just fine. It would have been nice to have a spindal but I knew what I was getting for the price."
4,JVC--TY Blank Discs,"Was advised of these discs by a professional photographer who I used to pay to dupe various tapes, process digital photos, etc. Never heard of these before then. Did a little research and found that various ""media rating websites"" did in fact cite these as one of 2 or 3 top blank DVD discs on the market. Supposedly they have a life of 30 years or more (apparently regular discs can begin to deteriorate, even if minutetly, within several years). Anyway, only reason I didn't give it a 5 rating is 1) Won't know for 30 years if the advertisement is accurate, 2) The discs don't clearly show which is the ""label"" side and which is the ""recording"" side. If you don't transfer from the packaged stack exactly, you can easily put the wrong side up/down in either your duplicator and/or DVD players. But, aside from this, feel this is a solid product at a good, fair price."
1,A very bad interpretatition of Skalkottas' music,"I doubt if Mr. Cristodoulou has any sense of what he is playing...If someone could feel the deeper meaning of these dances it's certain that he could not stand on his seat.Now, if someone hear these recordings not only he will not get the instict feeling of the Dance but it will be a boring experience to hear all the two hours of these cds!As regards the orchestra's playing it's known that is one of the world's best ochestras and i can not find a fair excuse for accepting this collaboration. I suppose that Mr. Christodoulou's worry is how to leave a name at the history books as the first that records music of Skalkottas and nothing more....."
1,boring as hell,this dvd sucked. it has no interveiws or even any music by green day.i would have made my rating no stars if i could.save youre money
1,ear training book with missing cd,I bought this used and it was sent without the CD. A waste of money on my part. An ear training book with no CD defeats the purpose.
3,Does not have Strong's definitions,A good concordance but it does not have the Strong's definitions I recommend getting one for the NASB with Strong's included.
5,A must read for all WWII veterans and relatives.,"This is a very personal, close up look of the life of Pvt. Joe Moss during the time he served in WWII. His private letters share the day to day thoughts, happenings, fears, and daily life as he served our country.The Author, Joe Rossi, uses his expert writing skills, along with his passion to share his Grandfather's letters to capture the reader and transport them back in time. You can't help but feel the worry, the fear, the anticipation, the strain of the daily life that the families endured alone while their men were away.It gave me an insight on the life of my own family members that served in WWII. Normal, everyday people whose lives were interrupted and how they made it through.I couldn't stop reading this book until it was finished. With each new letter from Joe, each new chapter, I found myself wondering what the next one would bring.I strongly encourange anyone that has a relative that served during WWII to read this book!"
3,Correspondence,"P.S. Kiss the Duchess For Me by Joe Rossi This book is a collection of letters from an un-famous soldier, Private Joe Moss, who was killed in World War II. The 150 love letters to his wife Gertie, in which he refers to his daughter as the Duchess, are a time capsule of the experiences and thoughts and dreams he had in basic training and in the foxholes of France. He did not survive to look back on the war as something he did and as history. The letters are down to earth and touching to read. For years they were carefully preserved in the attic of his granddaughter, who finally decided they are truly of interest to people who were not related to Joe. This little book reveals the feelings of those who endure the horrors of war and the thoughts of unfulfilled dreams and family life at home."
5,"P.S. Kiss the Duchess for Me by Joseph Moss, edited by Joe Rossi","I have to say Thank You to Joe Rossi for compiling his grandfather's letters into such an amazing book. Incidentally, his grandfather was my uncle - and I never really knew Uncle Joey because he left for war when I was three years old. Through the letters in this book, and the notes from Mr. Rossi about different events and people, I have gotten to know the man who left us far too soon, and to understand the sadness evinced by his brothers whenever his name was mentioned. This book is a must read for anyone who has lost a loved one in WWII, Korea, Vietnam, and the recent wars. This is really how it was. The memory of Uncle Joey was a deciding factor for my daughter to join the U.S. Army and serve our country proudly for 13 years. BTW, my grandson is named Joel -And I miss the Duchess - she and I shared the same monogram until we both married - MDM - it was a strong bond then and a bittersweet memory now."
3,Total Body? Not really,"I wasn't really impressed with this tape, and I generally love the Firm's tapes. This tape mainly focuses on the lower body (hence the ""buns"" title), but it isn't really difficult like The Tough Tape or Standing Legs. The focus of the tape is mostly on body building and not on cardio, in fact, there wasn't much cardio other than the warmup and some jumps (which are high impact). The tape itself is 45 minutes and would best be classified as intermediate. The equipment you will need is a ""tall box"" (12-14 inch) and a dowel (or broom), plus weights. If you are looking for an intermediate lower body tape, this one probably isn't bad, but try Tough Tape or Standing Legs if you are looking for maximum lower body work."
5,Excellent tape for getting back into excercise,"I've been on excercise sabbatical for a year, and needed to get it back into my life (amidst working full time and caring for our toddler). I have always enjoyed Firm Workouts, and I absolutely LOVE this tape. The instructors are extremely upbeat and motivational; the mix of the routines is optimal. There are new techniques added to their signature box work; the series of jumps showed me just how much more work I have to do until the tape becomes unchallenging! So, if you are returning to or starting exercise, you'll find this a fun, upbeat, unique workout that will make you sweat and clear your mind of any stress. I'm more than satisfied with this purchase."
2,Good for beginners..,"I am a BIG fan of FIRM videos, I have almost 20 of them.. I bought this video maybe 2 years ago and I have used it maybe once.. I think I am either high intermediate or advanced and this workout is just too easy. The music isn't the best the firm has used (I personally like Super Cardio for music and workout) I usually like all firm instructors, especially Susan Harris/Tracie Long and maybe Kai Sormekun and Jen Carman.but Jennifer Peluso is kind of scrawny and hard for me to follow)I think that any other firm video would be a good choice!"
2,not as advertised,"I have used other FIRM ""total body"" videos on a regular basis, and was looking for some variation from my usual routine - I was sorely dissappointed with this one. Only 4 minutes is spent on aerobics/upper body combined. The instructors are somewhat flat, and it should be labeled as a lower body workout. It also states that it is the newest release from the FIRM - 1998, but it does seem rather dated, I know other tapes have been re-released with new names, but I do not know if this one is one of them."
3,"Not one of the best Firm Videos, especially for instruction","I bought the Firm's ""Better Body & Buns"" because I enjoyed the ""Standing Legs"" and ""Lower Body Sculpting"". This tape doesn't quite compare to the other two. The instructions on this tape are poor. They hop from one instructor to the next and the cueing is terrible. However, it does work those buns and provides a total body workout. I usually save it for rainy days. But if you want a challenging lower body, I suggest the other two tapes above."
4,Very good if you have the required equipment.,"This is my first The Firm video and I definitely felt that it was one the most comprehensive of my exercise video library. I particularly like the variation of instructors; however it does require more specialized equipment such as a 12 or 14 inch step and a dowel which you can order from them. I would suggest making your own. I had to watch it all the way through, then did it all the way through. I thought it was easy enough to follow."
5,Happy,I was happy to get this book completing the series. The quality was a little better than I expected and it arrived promptly.I would order again without hesitation.
4,Until people start to listen....,"If you've never heard Heard (sorry) then it's time you did. Criminally underrated, Bruce Cockburn called him America's greatest songwriter and Pierce Pettis swore to record a Heard song on every album until people started to pay attention. This is a great album, with all of his usual lyrical depth, but it's a little one paced. You should buy Dry Bones Dance if you want a real intro to Mark, but until that's available on Amazon, buy this. Great songs, relevant lyrics and lots of rootsy groove, you'll love it."
5,Mark's impact continues,"Mark Heard has had a profound impact on many people's life. His lyrics have a way of capturing the essence of how a person feels at a particular moment in life. On this album, ""Hammers and Nails"" is particularly memorable, with a haunting harmony from the mandolin."
3,A bit disappointing,This is not one of Dick King-Smith's better books. The ending is somewhat unsatisfactory. And something that will bother some: Judy's journal entries include uncorrected misspellings.
5,WONDERFUL FILM!!!!!,"This film has the best story line I have seen in awhile!Although the production quality at times was less than normal, the story line quickly brings you in to the story.I cried at the end of this film and will never forget it!Now in my top 5 best films!It is also good to know that some of the proceeds from the sales of this film are donated to Veterans!Wonderful! Definitely reccomend!"
1,Third on a Match-rank amateur production,"It was like watching a high school student's video class project. Quality was like it was shot with a cell phone. Watched it with 3 others and we had to turn it off after 20 minutes. Complete waste of money. This movie will be ""Fourth on a Match"", as I plan on burning it."
4,Just like Mom's,"My mother bought a Magnalite Dutch Oven 50 plus years ago. I've tried hard since I've been married to replicate the beef/pork pot roasts and soups my parents cooked while I was growing up but never getting even close to taste or texture. It took my actually driving up to Western PA from Eastern MD to borrow her pot so I could produce a special German dish for friends this past year. I can't believe it's taken me so long (I won't tell you how long I've been married but the kids are grown and married)to realize it's that seasoned pot that makes the food taste so good. Well now thanks to the Internet and Amazon I've acquired my very own pot that's got Minestrone Soup simmering in it right now and it's well on it's way to being seasoned just right. I wasn't able to get a 4 quart Dutch Oven, just like Mom's. It was either the 3 qt covered casserole or the much larger 5 qt. Dutch Oven. I chose the 3 qt since there is just the two of us now and of course it's ""down sizing"" time."
2,Look Elsewhere for a Back Brush,"Although I received the item real fast, it was a BIG disappointment. The handle came off as I took it out of the package. Others had warned about this so this was not a huge surprise, although I had to repair it before I even got a chance to use it. Repair was easy; just a matter of sanding off the inferior glue that is used to attach the handle, and using a proper wood glue. After the 24 hour drying period, more disappointment; the Loofah is extremely hard and minimally pliable even when wet. Not the softer type that I expected. Even though the price is right, I would keep looking to find a back brush of better quality that is softer."
3,Handle a little too short,"Pretty good brush. However, handle was a little too short for my liking, as I have sore shoulders issues. Also, I would have preferred a rounded handle, which would have made it more comfortable when reaching over my shoulders. Handle kept cutting into my thumbs during use. But, overall a quality product. Would recommend."
2,decent,nice for the price but way too hard. more of a back scratcher. People say the head keeps falling off so i just super glued it before using it. You can tell it was poorly made. works ok.
1,some things are best left untranslated,This book has no beauty in it at all. Not in description or characters. Now I know why the French are so miserablés.
1,How About Not Opening The Door?,"I'll be blunt: I hated this novel. In the beginning I kept asking,"" Why not just open the door?"" It was one of those novels that is so supremely far-fetched, it's almost like art. Not like good art, the type you look at and say, ""Oh, beautiful landscape, lovely tree,"" but the kind where someone wraps themselves up in aluminum foil and stands in the middle of an art gallery. Then people who don't know much about anything, but have a few bucks in their pockets say, ""This is making such a statement! It's true, we all isolate ourselves away in this fashion ..."" or some other such nonsense.This is how the book felt for me. Pretentious. I just couldn't buy it from beginning to end and thought the main characters needed to grow a pair."
5,love it,"Searched for a ""one"" poacher for awhile..This one does the trick.Handle does get hot and lid too, have to be careful. but 3 to 4 minutes egg is perfect.cleans up easily too."
4,Need a little patience,"After I got the knack for it, it makes good poached eggs. There are two things that could be improved. (1) The instruction sheet enclosed is for a multiple egg poacher, and does not really apply to this item. (2) The instruction says oiling is optional, but when I used it without oiling, the egg stuck to the cup. After I oiled it once, it worked well. I didn't have to oil again, but the instruction should tell you to oil it once at first."
1,Pan does not align,"I had high hopes after reading the reviews of this poacher. However, the ""perfectly balanced pan"" slips and slides then falls inside the pot. The rim has a mismatched elongated shape. Who is now making this item?"
5,LOVED IT!,"I love this little egg poacher. It does the perfect poached egg. It's small & easy to handle. And best of all, it's easy to clean, unlike many other egg poachers I have used. Easy to store."
1,Too small for the smallest stove burner,This product is a super idea that doesn't work on a normal sized cooktops.... Not mine anyway. I want a pan to cover the entire burner for safety sake. The product covers little more than half the smallest hot burner surface leaving room for a senior or a reaching child's hand to get burned.It is being returned for that reason and I have ordered a four egg size pan.
5,egg poacher,"Good product made in china. The insert to make poach eggs is the perfect form, wide and shallow."
5,Fantastic,Love this poacher- it's nice and heavy and it also cooks the egg nice and fast. Use it every day! No complaints at all.
3,Not for induction cooktops,"Most high quality stainless steel has enough stainless steel in the plating layer to work on our GE Monogram induction cooktop, but low quality stainless typically does not have a thick enough stainless steel plating layer to work. This single egg poacher does not work on our induction cooktop. A shame, really, because otherwise it seems to fit the bill."
1,Not worth buying,"This book was probably the worst time waster for me in a long time. This author is so full of balloney. Who has the time to carefully monitor heart rate while exercising, timing exactly until one gets to a certain heart rate and than exercise only for a certain amount of minutes? Come on give me a break!"
5,"Simple, easy to understand, informative, a great source","It was an excellent source of basic information for the newcomer to the fitness world. The chapters were easy to understand but were in depth enough get the point across. An excellent source for someone who wants to get in shape. However, if you want a more scientific, in depth discussion, this may be a bit too simple."
2,Works well but poorly constructed.,"This is a review for theGiottos CL1310 Retractable 2-Position Goat Hair Brushsold by Kellards. The brush is soft and the head has a nice rounded shape. It does a good job at removing dust. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that the brush head separated from the housing within 20 minutes. I wish I could give it 4 stars and I would have had this not happened. That being said, I repaired it to better-than-new condition in 5 minutes with a little hot glue. I would buy this product again if the price dropped to $5. That's all it's worth if it requires reassembly."
2,Disappointing,I expected much more information and details about gold investment. The basic idea that author annoyingly repeats throughout whole book is the gold is good for investing and all other kind of investment are bad
5,Waste of money and time,"This book is absolutely NOT interesting. I bought because I was doing some research on the gold market for a research paper but this book was of no use at all. It doesn't tell anything interesting and the writer just tried to fill pages with boring information (f.i. a lot of quotes from Shakespeare and others). Save yourself time and money, get information on the gold market from your broker or through academic research paper."
1,Possessed by Demons,"If ever there was a ""no star"" product, it is this nightmare. Since I took it out of the box it has never worked correctly. At first it was minor things. Then after another trip back to the store for repair, an employee said ""Yeah, We've had to take all these things in for repair."" What he didn't say was, again, and again, and again. It only dubs when it feels like it. Once it started flashing blue, displayed the term ""LOADING"" and wouldn't allow me to operate my television for a day and a half. This thing makes Regan in The Exorcist look like a beginner. Tonight it ate a tape. And frequently it only plays tapes that somehow are to it's liking. This is the worst thing that ""plugs in"" that I have ever owned. I would say electronic device, but it is less trustworthy than anything purchased from an infommercial for $ 19.95. I will never own another JVC product. Class action lawsuit anyone? And to the person who said his was working...the clock is ticking."
1,Defective Unit,"I purchased this unit becaiuse it had all the features I was looking for in a DVD-VCR player recorder. I was able to hook it up with no problem and play DVDs right away. Then I tried to insert a VCR tape and the machine would not accept the tape. I have never had this problem with a VCR - you just put the tape in the door slot, it takes the tape, closes the door, and then plays. So thinking this was a new feature, I gently pushed the tape into the machine - it did not play and would not eject. I had to use a screwdiver and knife to remove the tape. I returned the machine. I thought about buying another one, but after checking the reviews on line, I have concluded not to buy this machine, or maybe not another JVC product at all."
1,Terrible Experience - Unit has never been right,"Bought this unit in late 2004 and spent mearly $500... after only a few weeks it started failing with LOADING ERROR... I called JVC and they told me the problem would go away if I unplug the unit for awhile and it was transient. The LOADING ERRROR became more and more frequent until I could not even use the unit without it failing. At that point, JVC acknowledged it as a known problem. I sent it in at my expense to factory service in late 2005 for a ""permanent fix""... It was fine for a month or so then the LOADING ERRORS started again, getting more and more frequent. I put up with it until if got so frequent that I cannot use the unit for even an hour without getting a LOADING ERROR. I am trashing the unit now!! Using my dependable VHS recorder until I can get a new DVD burner."
2,Nice concept but Quality control problems,"I also received the "" loading "" led message and unit began non functioning after 3 months. It took a while to figure half the features out but I got it working and made approximately 50 dvds from dubbing or recording off a satellite hard disk. I called JVC customer support and they helped me get the unit going, but alas it is broken along with my multi-region JVC dvd unit as well.Cannot recommend JVC....."
1,Buyer Beware!!,"I purchased this unit less than a week ago, based on the ""quick pick"" recommendation given by Consumer Reports. Wish I'd checked the reviews here first.. I'm already having the flashing ""LOADING"" problem that others have reported here at Amazon. I'll be returning the unit TODAY (while I still can!).. and I won't be replacing it with another JVC. Consider yourself warned!!"
1,didn't last 6 months,"It began about 4 months in, with an occasional crash and rebooting...which just continued to get worse. Then came the horrible pixelation breakups while watching DVDs. It got so bad, I had to send it to JVC for repair. lasted another 5 months, and began to crash again, until it reached a point where it stays permanently crashed, despite unplugging and replugging it back in. I am going to write JVC a nasty letter (ironic that this product is now discontinued) and be happy with the Sony DVD recorder I just bought to replace this piece of garbage."
1,Majority Rules,"After reading the reviews for the JVC DRMV1S, I will definately not even think of purchasing this product. Thanks for the warnings."
1,Defective product,"Although technically impressive, the DR-MV1's that I've had all suffered from VHS tape drive problems--resulting in tapes getting stuck during the loading process. I've had this happen several times and exchanged the problematic unit for a new one--then it happened again. I'm on my 3rd unit and the same problem just happened. I'm going to return it and buy and different brand. I called JVC and they told me that ""no problems have been reported with thousands of units sold so far"", but checking the Amazon review shows that this model has several problems."
1,Worst electronic device I ever bought! What happened JVC?,"I wish I'd read the reviews on here and at epinions BEFORE I bought it. VHS tape got stuck the very first time I used it. DVD would start to record and then say ""loading"". It wouldn't read JPEG files. Before this I've never had a problem with JVC but I don't know how they could have let this one get out to the stores. This bad of a product could destroy their reputation. I took it back and switched it for a Toshiba D-VR4. I havent had trouble with it...so far anyway"
1,Do not buy this. JVC has no customer support.,"This product is defective. It keeps flashing ""Loading"" everynow and then and becomes inoperable. I have not found any solution so far and the JVC customer support is mediocre at best. My unit was only 3 months old when this problem started. JVC makes poor quality products and do not buy them and they will not fix their problems."
1,Nothing But Trouble With DR-MV1S,"I bought it in May 2004. In Jan 2005 had the ""Loading Bug"". JVC Repair center ""fixed"" it. In Dec 2005, same problem was fixed under an extended warranty for $70.00. On July 3rd 2006 it now will not come on at all and all warranties are expired. JVC says ""Sorry""."
1,"Feature Laden, poor reliability","We purchased this unit 2 1/2 years ago. Within the first 6 months, and still under warranty, a pwb assembly had to be replaced due to electronic failure. Now, 2 years later and no longer under warrantee another electronic failure has occurred rendering the unit useless.Messages to JVC have remained unanswered.I would strongly suggest that if you are looking for a DVD/VCR player/recorder that you learn from my experience and go with a vendor other than JVC."
1,I will Never Buy another JVC Product,"YUP, it's Junk! Mine to started having problems after the 90 day full warranty. I too get the flashing ""LOADING"" message.However with mine, no matter how long you turn it off, it staysbroke. Same also if you leave it on. I called JVC, and they would not commit to fixing this without charges. I informed them this is a class problem. Still no commitments."
1,VHS tapes stuck,"I wish I would've read more reviews on this model before purchasing it back in November 2004. I returned the device 3 times to Crutchfield and all 3 did the same thing, the VHS tape sticks when trying to load it in. Thankfully Crutchfield has replaced it with a different model this 4th time with no cost to me. They have even paid for the return shipping each time.Stay FAR away from this model. Way too many problems."
1,The worst video device I have ever bought,"I have several kinds of audio and video devices from several brands (from Sony or JVC to Marantz or Rotel) but this is the most unreliable of all them. The first problem was with VHS tapes that stuck before to enter completely on the unit, the second problem was that unit sometimes does not turn on or if is on does not turn off no matter how many times you push the button, the third problem was sometimes the display panel blinks and show the word ""Loading"" and the unit does not work. With all this problems is almost impossible to use the unit.This product must be a shame for JVC that usually made reliable products... I wonder why JVC continues selling it knowing the several problems that the buyers have and the damage cause to their brand image."
1,Unreliable,"I wish I would have seen reviews before I bought this item just after it was introduced. I have a unit that was manufactured in March of 2004. Less than a year later the power unit died. Coverage is one year on parts and only 90 days on labor...repair was $35 for the part and over $100 for labor. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT AS IT APPEARS MANY OTHERS HAVE EXPERIENCED POOR RELIABILITY AS I HAVE. IF YOU DO BUY THE UNIT, BUY IT ONLY WITH EXTENDED WARRANTY. I never take the extended warranty coverage as I know it is a profit center for retailers, but this should have been an exception. Consumer Reports rates this unit highly, but they must not have the repair record on this specific unit."
1,Problems,"After about 3 weeks, tapes would get stuck half loaded. Took the first one back and it was exchanged for a new one. First tape I stuck in it got stuck. Took it back and got a Sony."
1,?quality,"7 mos into use(average 2 dvd`s a week),unit started to show white sands after 30 mins then totally washes out the picture after another 15 mins. called customer service , lady advices to ship unit to new jersey service center...sucks i have to pay shipping plus possibly labor, only parts are warranted for 1 year. my advice, get another model or brand."
2,Product might be fine BUT,Unable to find any avenue on this website to say that you charged me $3.99 for giftwrap. The wrapping was ripped along one side of the book and the packaging was obviously inadequate to save it. Kind of shabby to give a gift with the paper torn.
3,Food and CD,"I love the music, but I haven't used the recipe book much. I wish there was a separate storage case for the CD so I could store it with my collection of music rather than with my cookbooks."
4,Peaches and Screams,"Book #13 Read in 2013Peaches and Screams by G.A. McKevettThis is the 7th book in the Savannah Reid mystery series. In this book, Savannah heads back to her southern hometown for the wedding of one of her sisters. When she arrives, she finds one of her brothers has been arrested for the murder of the town judge. Savannah does not believe that her brother did it, so she sets out to use her former cop/current PI skills to clear his name. She gets some help from her friends Dirk and Tammy. But will they be able to prove Macon's innocence?I enjoy this series. Savannah is a great main character--tough yet caring, cat owner and intelligent. I also like her relationship with Dirk and Tammy. I will continue this series.[...]"
4,Epic resurgence for the World of Greyhawk,"Have you ever wished that you could have all of the essential information and darkest secrets of the Free City of Greyhawk in one volume, compiled at your fingertips? This giant, 128-page guide (for the DM's eyes only!) gives full details on the people, cultures, shops, sights, dungeons, and arcane magic of the most famous and majestic city in roleplaying. Also includes a gorgeous color poster map of the surrounding regions, a 16-page map booklet, and more! The ultimate reference for a classic Greyhawk campaign."
5,Excellant and highly entertaining book,I was looking for a book as an introduction to scootering with my husky and got more than I bargined for with this.This book is highly informative and very funny (I was laughing out loud for much of it). Covers sledding and other dog powered sports.Highly recommended.
2,Very Light on Conspiracy theories,"As my title says ,this DVD was a rehash of the murders,not enough on the Conspiracy theories part for my taste ,but the scenes of the crime scenes then and now was interesting but not enought o carry this DVD"
2,Mediocre documentary...,"...made even more insufferable by poor narration. Why they couldn't narrate this documentary in a faster, clearer tone is beyond me. The slow grating OTT narration belongs in a hammy horror film not in a serious documentary.If you can get beyond this and the cheap cliché re-shoots of Jack walking the cobblestone streets with a gladstone bag then the contemporary shots of the crime scenes are fascinating to those who have not been to Whitechapel and wish to see how things have changed (and see how things haven't changed) since the days of 1888.There are better documentaries out there on the Jack the Ripper subject - in particular the History one."
1,20# Perfect Rx Best Whey is over-priced,"Perfect Rx 20lb. bucket from Nature's Best was originally priced here on Amazon at $120 (put on wishlist a month ago), now $192.00 for same product in stock January 31, 2010. I like the product but not that much!!! I'll shop elsewhere for it or skip it entirely."
3,XL not big enough!,"I don't know who's head they are basing the XL size on, but it certainly isn't big enough for me!"
2,"60% Filler, 35% Anecdotal, 5% Worthwhile Information","When I first bought it for myself and skimmed the first few pages, I was very excited about the book and thought that it would be a worthwhile read. As I kept reading, though, it became increasingly apparent that this guy was just trying to sell copies of his book, and didn't have much worthwhile information to say. He constantly repeats that he is showing you how to ""get rich"" without providing any substantive advice. He repeats lists that have little or no value, including things like ""Work Hard"" over and over again.From the outside in it seems great, but after going through it you will have learned very little from the book. All of the worthwhile information in the book could be sufficiently summarized in two paragraphs. I find it hard to believe that most of the other reviewers actually read the entire book. Do yourself a favor and read the better books out there, like Clason's the ""Richest Man In Babylon."""
5,Financial Independence,"Michael Masterson's wealth-building advice has changed my life. In just six years, I went from being a $40K-per-year employee with a negative net worth to being the owner of a thriving business and having a personal net worth of over $1 million.I say this not to brag, but to show that Michael Masterson's advice works ... no matter what your age. (I'm in my 40s.) And, he couldn't have made it easier to follow his proven advice than he did in Automatic Wealth for Grads. I'm thrilled the kids I care about will have the chance to get started on their journey to financial independence much sooner than I did thanks to having this book to guide them."
3,same ol info you can find in every other book,"nothing special here...shows how income saved can grow using compound interest...woopdee friggin doo, seen that in finance class as well.Oh..on one of the chapters he states how you can increase your income up to 10 fold!!!! heres how...work harded...what lame advice..make yourself invaluable...but how? do things that arent in your job description? ....right.....sure.....what a joke.dont waste your time on this book and get Automatic millioaire...its better than this book and teaches you how to automate your saving/investing and also Lazy Guide to Investing...teaches you to invest in no stress index funds (no load as well) that historically give you a 10% return."
2,I purchased 15 copies for grads.,"Michael Masterson,I have not read your book, but based on the advance publicity, and the respect I gained for you at the Delray Beach Investment U seminar, I purchased 15 copies from Amazon as gifts to graduating seniors of my SAE fraternity at Miami University. I was disappointed with Amazon because I understood that they were to include a book entitled ""Real Estate Rules For Young Adults"" and they didn't send them.John E. Gobeille"
4,Great for Anyone Starting Out!!!,"As a 20 something, I found this a great resource. Finance is not taught in school so these practical tips are perfect for a jumping off point. I really enjoyed the book!"
4,Pretty good read. Leaves out lots of the details.,"I like the overall point of this book. I also agree with a lot of the stuff he teaches in regards to using real estate and owning your own business as the only true way to get superb rates of returns. However, he does make one huge assumption in the real estate section that is not clear: that you can rent a house for the same cost as your expenses. This may work in some cheaper areas, but in the places where houses have skyrocketed in price, expecting to get a high enough rent to cover all the fees is not realistic for some major areas. Also, he makes it sound like getting 150k is easy for a salary. Unfortunately for those of us in stable ""normal"" fields like engineering, nursing, accounting, etc... asking for a 30% raise would get you a lot of laughs at best. Nonetheless, I would still recommend it to other new grads."
5,Automatiac Wealth for Grads by Michael Masterson,What an informative and insightful book. I wish someone had given me this information when we started out. Wouldn't it bea great service to this country if this book could be turned into a course that's mandatory for all high school and college graduates!I bought three copies as gifts. After reading the book I'm considering giving it as a gift for all graduations and weddings.
2,Nice bike for a kid but disappointing,"The bike frame was welded together wrong! The front wheel could not be put on the bike because the arms were not aligned. How can they make a bike so obviously defective and try to sell it? IF the bike had been correctly manufactured, it would have been the perfect bike for my 13 year old son. The quality of the bike itself was OK, a few things probably should have been a bit more quality, like the pedals, they were plastic, not good for $169. I'd say if you are a serious biker, this is not the bike for you. If you ride a bike for lesiure or family time, it would be fine.Buying through Amazon was great, I was able to return the bike, free shipping, and was credited back the $169. I love buying from Amazon, they make it so easy for you, if your purchase doesn't work out. So don't tear the box up until you know the bike is a keeper!"
3,Only thing good about this bike is the price...,Like other reviewers have pointed out the brakes on this thing are flimsy and its only a matter of time before the fail to work properly. Shipping was free and it looked that way when I received the bike. Shipping was so bad my rear rim was so bent it would not spin. Also the front forks/shock system was so badly put together I had to take it to the local bike shop and have them redo it. When riding the gears would automatically change. I'm sorry to say I do not recoomend this bike. Take your money and invest it into a better bike. I wish I had :(P.S One good thing about this bike is it has a sturdy aluminum frame. Thats about it.
3,Could be better,"Amazon did their job quite well, it is GMC who did not perform so great. The bike arrived well ahead of schedule, however, the bike is not very well built. The frame is solid, the brakes and gears are a bit cheap, and they gave me a different seat than what was pictured(it is a big old granny seat). If you were to put new brakes and maybe a new gear set on this bike it would be about a 400 dollar bike. So it is overall a project bike for me, otherwise a great starter bike for someone who does not ride often."
3,all-in-one should mean just that,"I must say this book has been very helpful, but according to most of the reviews I have read, I am very hesitant to take the exams with this book as my only study guide. Also, I have found several answers that were wrong in the questions at the end of each chapter. With only 10 questions how hard can it be to make sure they are 100% correct??? Seems very careless... I have the 6th edition of Meyers' book, but I think I am going to buy Exam Cram's book of nothing but practice questions."
4,Great book!,This book is very detailed and a great reference. I recommend it to anyone wanting to take the A+ exams.
4,CompTIA A+ Certification Exam Guide Sixth Edition,This book has it all plus it is actually pretty fun to read for a tech book.
4,Great price - easy read,"This CompTia A+ certification book by Mike is very good. It not only prepares you for the exam, but allows you to understand the reason for what you are studying for. Also, the side humor in the book helps keep it from being too boring."
1,Outdated,"This book is almost 10 years old and so much has changed. Not only did I fail my first attempt at the Remote Tech 603 exam, this book did not include the CD that comes ith these book in the back. It would be nice to know how out dated the book if and whether it contains all of the material that is suppose to some with it. I'd really like to send this right bok and get my money back because of the incomplete order!!!!"
1,Absolutely useless for A+ preparation,"If you want to learn about computers and have no prior experience, this is an excellent place to start. If you are studying for your A+ certification, stay away from this book. For over a 1000 pages of material, its ridiculously light on real material. To make matters worse, the ""practice exams"" have questions that were not covered in the book. Mike Meyers is an absolute joke."
5,Computer Tech Wannabe,I do computer tech work as a hobby and hope to get A+ certified sometime soon. I have only read a little over 200 pages (out of 1100+ pages) of the book. I think that it is very informative and interesting. I have even used the book to figure out a problem that I was having with a PC! I would recommend this book.
5,Excellent!!!,"This is an excellent book, easy to understand, so many details, I am sure I am going to buy all the next edition....Thanks for Amazon for the best prices, and quality....Again thank you!!!"
5,great,Very informative book. Makes it easy for readers to understand. Some experience on computers seem necessary .Thanks and wish me luck on the exam! Great seller as well. Fast shipping.
5,This book helped me pass my ComTIA A+,I learned a lot from this book and it helped me pass my A+ certification. Topics are presented and illustrated very well.
5,This book is the BOMB!!!!,"I studied this book for four months and I nailed the exam. I coupled this book with going to school, but I realized all I needed was this book.My school books for A+ are still in plastic wrapping, they have never been opened. The best thing about this book is the practice exams it gives you on the CD. Taking the practice exams prepared me alot, because the questions are very similiar to the real CompTIA exams. If I new what this book was all about before going to school for A+ I could have saved $1500 bucks. Oh well for that I guess. You don't know what's good for you until it smacks you in the face."
4,Solid Explanation of the Basics,"Charlene Altemose's book, What You Should Know About the Mass, is an excellent introduction to those who are new to the Catholic Mass. In the book, she discussed some general ideas of thanksgiving, sacrifice, praise, worship, and community. Then in the following chapters she concisely and accurately describes the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the Catholic mass. Readers will find information on persons involved in the liturgy, liturgical colors, liturgical items, the order of mass - explained, and a brief synopsis of the liturgical year.I have used this as one of the textbooks for freshmen in Catholic high school, and it is easily understood by the students.My only critique of the book is that it does not treat the notion of real presence with any depth, but then again, it is an introductory book."
3,"Great product, but find the version without the music","I love these tapes in the old format. It's true that they are essentially audio 'flashcards'. You do need to use a course that teaches grammar as well. These tapes are great for developing the ability to recognise the spoken word. There's also another, related product, which teaches some basic gramatical structures. I like that product, too.So why only three stars? This version has music in the background, which I find a bit distracting. It's based on research related to the 'Mozart Effect'(which has been discredited, by the way)The idea is that if you study while listening to classical music, you'll learn faster. Doesn't work for me. In fact, I don't really like it, but you might not mind. My suggestion would be to go to the library and try out the two versions before buying."
3,It did not help me,"This course consists of unconnected words that you have to repeat. Since words are notorganized by topics, there is no context to help you remember them. I doubt that this program is going to help you to gain fluency in German. If what you want is to improve your pronunciation, there are specialized courses. In my opinion, reading books is the best way of learning vocabulary, since you learn vocabulary in its context."
5,Great Product,"Got this for a friend's birthday present. It smells feminine, clean, and fresh! This is a great gift for young or older ladies."
4,sammyjoe,This cologne is really great. I used it before and thats why I ordered it and the experience is what I had expected. Wasn't dissappointed at all.
3,ITS TINY!,OMG! I am so sad - My son was so excited when he saw this and wanted it -He is going to be so disappointed on Christmas morning when he opens it and sees its practically the size of a LEGO gun! AH MAN! BIG BUMMER!
2,MAY THE FORCE NOT FORCE YOU TO BUY THIS,"AS A CHILD OF THE LATE SEVENTIES AND EARLY EIGHTIES, STAR WARS WAS MAHNNA FROM HEAVEN; HAN SOLO WAS THE COOLEST GUY IN THE WORLD, AND I WANTED TO OWN A WOOKIE! ASIDE FROM THAT, I MADE A MISTAKE BY ORDERING THIS; NOT THE FAULT OF THE PRODUCT, THE FAULT OF KNOWING MORE ABOUT STAR WARS THEN MATH! I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A BIT LARGER, LIKE THE ONES WE HAD FROM KENNER GROWING UP; BUT BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW FRACTIONS AND MEASUREMENTS, WHAT I GOT WAS A MINI-GUN. SO I KEEP IT IN IT'S BOX, NICE PACKAGING BY THE WAY, AT LEAST THE PHOTO OF HAN IS COOL...BUT HAD I KNOWN THEN, WHAT I FOUND OUT LATER, I WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN IT ONMLY BECAUSE OF THE SIZE; THE PRODUCT IS FINE, FOR TRUE COLLECTORS THIS MIGHT BE THEIR HEART'S DESIRE....MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU WISE SHOPPERS...CHEWIE GET ME OUTTA HERE...."
3,"Rehash of ""new economy"" jargon","... Cairncross is a very good writer whose prose is effective and lucid regarding the Internet's impact (and future) in business strategy. However, the author doesn't shed any new insights concerning the Internet's effects and value-creating abilities... Once again, I read about the marvelous Dell Computer's JIT process and how the Internet is leveraged to deliever superior value (vs. Company/HP). Who, having been up-to-date on business literature & strategy, hasn't touched on the Dell process?Bottom line: Good refresher course on the Internet's impact, nothing extraordinary about the book's conclusions."
3,Good for the price,"These Posiquiets are half the price of my previous Akebonos and offer better stopping power.Used on 03 Protege with 4 lug front discsInitial bite when cold is poor but this quickly disappears then it bites, really bites. Little fade but more than the ceramics obviously.Heavy brake dust but that's a non issue for me.Shims included and pre burnished but i still did my own bedding procedure."
2,not what i expected,"i've known about skinny pimp for a leats 6 years now and i thought he made good cds. i bought this one because there was a song i remember hearing back in 2004/2005 called ""bend yo back"". i found it on this cd. i bought it and it didnt hit my expecations but im not mad because i paid only 50 cents for the cd (not including shipping)."
5,Skinny Pimp Still on top,"If you like gangsta/pimp with a flow mix of three 6, twista, and 8ball/mjg.. You will love this Fast flows, gangsta flows, pimpin all combined. check it out it is well worth the money."
3,Challenging Title,"Excellent author. Highly recommend this book for those who like intrigue, adventure and espionage."
3,Heavy on the new stuff,"After seeing this dvd for the first time I was surprised at how heavy the concert was on 80's era songs. Not that that's necessarily bad. The newer Kiss songs were taken soley from Lick It Up, Creatures of the Night, and Animalize. There are only 6 makeup era songs on the set. Only 5 are from the Criss/Frehley era. ""Detroit Rock City"",Cold Gin"",""Love Gun"",""Black Diamond"", and ""Rock And Roll All Nite."" I was shocked that songs like ""Deuce"",and ""Calling Dr. Love"" were not included. Some of these songs sounded rushed through. Kiss, during this period, were clearly more comfortable playing the 80's stuff. Average as concerts go. Except for Gene breathing fire, there are no visual highlights to speak of."
4,Kiss Animalize Live Uncensored - Very 80s Indeed,"Well first off this is a really entertaining piece of film showcasing Kiss 2 years into the non-makeup era and looking a little lost (Gene with his wig held on with a sweatband due to his ""acting"" he was doing on the side, Paul in a ridiculous pink floaty thing and Spruce Kulick playing like his feet are nailed to the floor!).The set list is good as it features songs from Lick It Up that though lost on the album were much faster and came off better ""live"" which raises another oft discussed Kiss topic - is it live or memorex.... well, there isnt a doubt in my mind that the guitar is touched up as are the vocals (you can hear Paul when hes nowhere near the mic... you can hear his guitar parts when he isnt actually playing it etc etc... the same stuff as would later become very irritating on the Kiss Konfidential video) -However for entertainment value - well worth buying!"
4,Skull Ring,"Nice ring! It has some weight to it, even in the small size that I purchased. The ring is shiny, although from the photo it looks more like it would have a dull finish, which is what I thought it would be when I ordered it. Makes no difference, I still think it's a real nice ring. Worth its price."
2,size????,"Yeah, it looks nice, but it could be as big as Diana Ross's eyeballs!!!cm?mm?Description old glory...come on! This is the internet. Be descriptive."
3,Fathoms,I have another album by the Fathoms which I have enjoyed for some time. When I saw this album I thought that I might try it. It is a good album but not fantastic in my opinion. The music takes you back to another time and I find that nostalgic trip enjoyable but this is not an album I would put on every week or every month for that matter but it is worth a listen.
2,Doesn't work with Baby Born doll,"We bought this thinking that my daughter would love feeding her Baby born in it. Wrong!! The doll needs to be laying back in order to feed her, this makes the baby sit up! Doesn't make sense to make a highchair FOR this doll when it can not be used WITH it!! It is a pain to put together, but it is very sturdy and will last a long time, but you will have to use if for other ""babies"", NOT Baby Born."
4,Smooth Pop,"It's and excellent chill and groove record at the same time. Somewhere between the awesome ""If This Bass Could only talk"" and the Clarke/Duke project records."
4,A very good Jazz selection,This album is really a good mood setting piece. Especially the cut from Poetic Justice. The instrumentalism is simply breath taking. Kudos go to Mr. Clarke for his tribute to Ceasar Chavez. An instrumentalist with a message.
2,Disappointing,This is a disappointing repackaging of 3 mediocre cd's of three exceptional 50's crooners. I guess I should have read the description closer. I was expecting remastered greatest hits cd's and what is included are three old cd's that can be found in most any store's cut-out bin for $9.99 or less.
2,Not Worth Reading,"If you know HTML, you already know everything in this book. If you don't know HTML, you won't learn it from this book. It's much too simplistic. It also encourages copying pictures and code from other websites.It's really something I'd expect to see posted for free on the internet--that's the level of writing & information. And at least the links would be updated online.As a beginner's book for a child, it might be okay, but for an adult or anyone with experience, it's not worth reading."
5,My son loved this book !!!!!!,I bought this book for my 12 year old son and he actually enjoyed reading it. He has been creating web pages ever since. He is now the Web Master at his middle school and is responsible for their web page. I hope Dave writes some more computer related books for kids/teenagers to keep their interests up.
2,A waste of time and money,"This book was nothing to be proud of writing. A HUGE amount of grammatical errors, along with some incorrect information make this book one that should've never made it to publication. The content was only so-so, with very little advanced or semi-advanced material included. I can find the same information worded much better for free online, so the book's really not worth it.There are many better ways to learn how to program a web page that are online and free of charge.If you want to make a webpage that your mom will be proud of instead of learning how to make a real website, this book could be for you."
1,Not one size fits all!!,"Too small for this melon!! States one size fits all, but not so!! Was looking forward to wearing it at work, but now I'm trying to sell it."
3,Live Audio Basics issues,"Haven't gone right through the course but the resource CD with the charts etc.. will not play/open in a number of PCs that I have tried it in. The idea is great and what is provided sounds useful, just disappointed I can't access the resources.Supplier have sent me a zip file of what is on the resource CD."
5,Wow! Easy enough for a child.,I have read this authors other books and this one is on all levels. My 9 year old daughter wanted me to buy this book and within an hour she was making her first mixed free cd. She loves it!
1,"Cheaply made, poorly designed, good service","Because I was on a deadline, and couldn't tell much from the photos, I ordered 3 different load levelers on Amazon: this unit, the Mountain Sling (Handsontools) and the OTC Engine Load Leveler - 4305 (Costplustools). This unit had no bushings, and a cheap crank, both of which would make it difficult to crank and manipulate. I kept the OTC from Costplustools-it was well made, and had the design details such as bushings, good attachment points and a good handle. I returned this leveler which was promptly and courteously credited by CVF no questions asked. I recommend spending a little extra to get the unit from Costplustools-you will be glad you did when you are pulling that engine.OTC Engine Load Leveler - 4305"
5,Beautiful!!!,"Bought it for my partner and he has had literally dozens of compliments on it. It's a bit large, so better for a man. The workmanship is wonderful and the white gold adds class to it all."
1,Terrible!!!!,Agree with the above review.... these bulbs aren't white or blue but basically stock yellow. Compared them side-to-side with the stock bulb and it just slightly brighter than stock but EXACT same color as stock! Switched to MTEC Cosmos Blue bulbs which are actually bright white with a hint of blue. MUCH better than Hella.
1,Not Blue (or even white),"I previously had Predator Xenix HyperMatch blubs for my fogs. When one when out I got a set of the Hella ""Xenon Blue"" bulbs to replace them. I installed the first one and then compared. The Hella bulb looks nothing like the Predator, nor does it come close to matching the color of my Xenon headlamps. These lights are not blue, white, or anything close to matching a Xenon. They are plain old halogen yellowish.They do look nice and bright. Probably a fine bulb, but they won't come close to matching a Xenon headlight's color."
5,The Forbidden Garden - Ursula Curtis,Book arrived in perfect condition (considering it is quite old) and very promptly.
1,Horrible Experience,I never received the hat and I expedited the order. When I asked about a full refund they put me off. I still have not ever received the hat or a refund. I will never order from Amazon again after this experience.
1,Don't waste your cash,its a bloody Brazillian bootleg. Buy the legit Greatest Video Hits 2 DVD - its a much better release.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I purchased this book as a requirement for my PNP course. Needless to say, this book is not very helpful. It seems many very important topics extremely relevant to pediatric primary care are either not in the book or are very briefly mentioned. It is also not very detailed at all. I always have to read from other books to get a better comprehensive understanding of topics. Treatment options are also very vague if they are even listed. I can only hope the newer edition is much, much better."
5,lovely stuff from our hero,"Away from SY, thurston has done some super avant garde weir stuff & also some fine pop stuff in this. It starts off w/ a phone call from Melbourne's Midget Stooges asking if he got their demo tape, they did end up being on a split 7"" on his Ecstatic Peace label, also later in the album, Yoshimi calls up [from Free Kitten, Boredoms & OOIOO]. These are very good stick in yr head for days songs, particularly the ones on the 1st half of the album, some of the others are slow & lazy, maybe because they're more personal stuff, the title track & Queen Bee have some of his best lyrics ever [see his raps on 1991: the Year Punk Broke which are very amusing]. The last track, Elegy for all the Dead Rock Stars is a 20 minute instrumental strumfest which would be the perfect b-side for the Diamond Sea from the same year. Credit must be given to Steve Shelley & Tim Foljahn for helping him craft this gem."
5,its very Thurston-ish,"A really great album. If you like Goo, Dirty and Experimental Jet Set Trash and No Star... this is a great companion piece especially to the latter b/c it was released at the same time. Don't think of this as a Sonic Youth album tho, if you're expecting a SY album you'll be disappointed b/c the other main elements aren't there. But, its a really beautiful thing to listen to... its very Thurston-ish."
1,Poor Description,"This product is poorly described by the seller. It should state that it is in a powder form and not liquid (the word capsules is not describing the form in which the product is sold, so be careful; liquid form is much better absorbed by your body). As a result we lost $114 although we sent back the entire order. It was the worst experience we ever had by purchasing any product on line."
4,Vitalzym,"Vitazym did help me to ""get a regular"" constitution for about the first week of taking it, but now I'm back to irregular. It has helped greatly with digestion and with releaving pain enough that I will continue to purchase vitalsym again."
5,vitalzym 450,I received this item FAST. Used this product before but this was the ist time I purchased it from Amazon. Great price!
4,Falconcrest,This is a Christmas gift. I know we'll enkoy it--hope we can get more when we finishing watching it on a cold stormy ND night.
2,No Chapters in Season 2 Release,"I ordered Season 2 from Warner Bros. because I read where they were only making them on demand. I was so disappointed to find out that for $50 the DVDs did not even have chapters or subtitles. Without chapters, you cannot stop playing and return to the same position to finish watching the show at a later time. Also, nothing displays in the elapsed time without chapters. I called customer service at WB and registered my complaint, but I doubt if they will change anything for the making of Season 3."
4,There is no Disc Menu: to select the subtitles?,"I just starting viewing Season 5th. Very intersted, I like to have the subtitles , because I had a stroke, and for me,sometime, I can not understands the words clearly. So, I understand ,there are others, with disablilites. I always thought, it was Warner Bros.putting those series. They need to let us know,they don't put out, all of menus, that we are used to. I have no,problems with acting,or video, I just wish they ,will correct that, problem. thanks, julie"
1,falcon crest season two,"Poor quality, no running time display or chapter marking. Will not play on DVR DVD player. After season DVD this season two is a total disappointment big time. Plus it is way too costly!!!!"
1,wrong case sent,"I ordered the Meade 773 Case and it was shipped by Ace Photo & Digital. I received the wrong size case which, according to their ""customer service"" has happened before. They refused to pay for the return shipping, though it was their error, and then told me that the Meade #773 was no longer available, and that they could substitute a case for the ETX 80 which ""should fit"" Be very careful with this item / vendor."
2,Overpriced,"Functional, yes, but terribly overpriced.A bit of pre-formed plastic plus a foam insert to hold the 'scope and some accesories. ..."
5,"A wonderfully readable book, beautifully written.","Stitt's analyses of the five poets are superb and full ofinsights, butperhaps most striking is his use of the philosophy of modern physics, fully explained in the introduction and developed throughout. An impressive performance and an excellent book overall. Beautiful design too!"
4,Nice but thin,"I love this charm- I just wish it was a little thicker. It is a thin piece of gold and even sounds thin(if that makes any sense). It was a gift bought for me off my wish list- if I spent the money myself, I would have returned it."
3,Fun language play for kids,"This is an enjoyable book that tells a story about intercultural relationships in a subtle, kid-friendly way. The language in it (playing off the Hawaiian names for two reef fish) is playful and fun, although at times it is a bit overwrought. The book jacket plays up its premise of intercultural relationships (as represented by the two different kinds of fish), but this message is very understated and may not be immediately apparent to a young audience. Nevertheless, even without an appreciation for this aspect, it is a fun oral story that at a minimum doesn't perpetuate a monoculturistic perspective."
4,Very Nice,"I enjoyed this book and am sure that my grandchildren will as well. I was surprised that it was smaller and less interactive then the companion book. ""Egyptology, Search for the Tomb of Osiris"" which everyone in my family loves. But this one is fun and full of understandable information."
4,Fun trip to an ancient find,"I purchased this book to help with research I'm doing on my next tween book that happens to deal with ancient Egypt. I found this book fun and interesting. Sure, it doesn't have true Egyptology stuff but is more geared toward a younger audience."
4,Beautifully presented,"I gave my son several books on Egyptology for Christmas. When he opened this one this morning, he couldn't put it down! For anyone interested in Egypt, this book is great!"
4,Great Childrens Gift,This book is great as a gift for a child with interests in Egypt. Nice illustrations.
4,The best way to hear Genesis,"Altough maybe you already have the CD's in this collection, if you really like them won't let pass this box. The 5.1 mix of the disks are REALLY REALLY AWESOME. The bonus videos also fulfills the expectations. Why 4 stars? The DTS mix sound a lot lot lot much better than the Dolby one. Why is this? I don't know, but I think is something you should be aware of."
1,Sound quality is awful,"I had been looking forward these box sets long before (both 1976-82 and 1983-98 you can apply this review). Now, I have spent a lot of money and I am very dissapointed with the SACD stereo mix sound quality. I can't stand the harsh sound in my headphones (top level stuff both headphones and amplifier) and in my ATC loudspeakers the thing does not improve very much. Everything is louder, the mix and EQ is a completely disaster. For me the sound quality is essential to enjoy music, so if you look for this, better try the remastered old CD's (The Tricks of the tail MFSL LP version blows SACD away). The visual extras are not really new at all (for very very fans at least) . So the only one reason to get these box sets is (if you have the money) to have two beautiful boxes in your collection."
5,"FANTASTIC PRODUCT LINE,BEEN USING FOR YEARS.","I have used this product line for many years (10+). I have tried many other brands but this one with its simplicity and high level of pure retinol does what it is supposed to do- remove fine lines and wrinkles. The price point is great compared to those other brands. I also have very dark under-eye circles on some days, and the eye gel improves the dark rings on contact which is amazing. The slight scent of this face cream is light and beautiful. Most importantly I see great results after using it for only a few days (I am 43 years old.) Bought the eye gel and this face cream for my mom who was complaining about her complexion. She was happy with the results as well. Her skin looks smooth and fresh and the under eye lines are dramatically improved.I highly recommend anything from Robanda. This brand is highly under-rated."
5,"Strong discipline, strong results","There are no magic tricks here, just sound nutritional principles. I've wasted too much time and pain on fads in the past and this diet is the perfect antidote. Good food, taken in moderation with strong behavioral guidelines to help you. I'm a month in and I've lost 17 lbs and it feels like I will keep them off. The balanced diet has eliminated the hunger and cravings which have haunted me in the past. The book is a joy to read and so easy to follow."
5,FINALLY - just what I've been looking for!,"I am so excited that I decided to order this book. I am already into week 3, and feel that this will finally be the catalyst to help me change my eating habits! This is an easy-to-follow, no-nonsense plan for easing into a healthier lifestyle. Everytime I've gone on a ""diet"" I usually last about 3 days, before all of the food I've labeled ""forbidden"" begins to tempt me. By using this book, and taking necessary changes step by step, instead of ""all or nothing"", I am on the way to eating healthier, and am losing weight as well. The info in this book certainly isn't ""new,"" but is laid out in such a way that success seems much easier to attain."
4,Dissapointed in hard cover,"I was dissapointed in the hard cover version of this book, and would reccomend the soft cover spiral bound book if you are to get it. It has sound practical advice for the first time ""dieter"" but for people who have tried it all like myself I found the information repetitive, and most of the ""Good Stuff"" you can download online during the free trial period (like stretches and exercises for the desk bound.) If you are a seasoned dieter, you may want to pass on this one, but overall it was a good book."
3,It's Okay,"It's a decent approach, and there certainly is some good information to be found in here. I did not like it. But every approach to a healthy life comes from different places. The layout was not overly appealing to me for starters. I thought that there were an awful lot of pictures and not an awful lot of information."
4,boole,"came on time, great gift idea, loved the product, wonderful service, nice to have around when you need good read"
2,I don't like it,"I don't like it.I hate those vulgar expressions on the porn star's face. On the other hand, I don't think he is now beautiful at all. He looks much worse than 5~6 years ago."
1,Practically useless,"For some reason, we still have this book in our library of solar books. It's only value is as an historical relic. Just at random I looked up about 20 names, and only 2 were still in business, one under a different name and address"
3,better than rev,"i bought this cd before i was aware of the rev members. i don't care for the rev but somehow love this cd. usually very picky with my music, so a bit confused why i like this so much. best line- ""do you ever wonder why, the morning sky..."""
4,some great psychedelic noise,"Composed of three memebres of Mercury Rev and friends of theirs, Hopewell isn't what you'd expect Merucry Rev to sound like. However the psychedelic element is still present. The guitars of course have a great presence on the album and sound dreamy, noisy, as every good guitar should. If you can find a song that touches you more than ""Christmas Now"" well, then it means you listened to a great genius... Pure audio pleasure guaranteed !"
1,Worst soup I ever had,"I bought a multi-pack which included split pea and every soup was horrible. Some had no taste at all, while others were overly salty and slightly ""chemical"" tasting. I love split pea soup but this one was just absolutely awful."
1,As bland as oatmeal,I bought this album and found it to be very disappointing. I listened to sample clips online and thought they sounded great especially 'Taffy'. Then when I listened to the entire album I found it to be dull and flat. A couple catchy songs here and there but overall it wasn't as good as I expected. I'm taking my copy back to the used CD store. Lisa Loeb seems like a nice person but I can see why she was a one-hit-wonder. =/
5,Out of the Lisa closet,"OK.. I'm shallow. I was watching $25,000 Pyramid when Lisa and Dweezel were guest contestants. I thought to my self, ""Wo, she's really good looking."" I remembered liking that video where she walks around the apartment in one long shot and wondered if she had any chops other then cool glasses. So I started pickin up used CD's when I could find them and was moving in a Lisa fan direction. This one sealed the deal. Smart musician, with a unique pocket. She just got prettier....."
5,This CD is the best CD i've ever had...,"Oh my God......This cd has definately changed my life.. I've been through a lot of changes in the past few months, including a move across the country, losing best friends and family and a lot of other stuff that has ruined my life.. and about a week ago i boughtthis cd, not knowing anything about it and listened to it that night......Let's just say there were a lot of tears involved.....but that was a good thing because I needed some of that at the time. The words and her voice let you know that she has either dealt with it or wants to help you deal with it, and i'll always from now on love her for changing me. I love you Lisa Loeb for having such a good heart and soul!"
5,A Bible for beginning codicologers,"This slim volume by Michelle Brown is an excellent resource for anyone who is interested in the study of books and manuscripts (codicology). In a succinct dictionary format, Brown gives definitions of all of the major terms that may give trouble to someone visiting a museum or reading a work by such major writers in the field as Chris DeHamel. Suitable as both a textbook and a companion to books on manuscripts, this book is nearly indispensible to the beginner and the intermediate in allowing some understanding into the complex technical and art-historical vocabulary used in the field."
4,Not What I Expected,"While I realize that the book is a guide to technical terms, you need to know what they are on a manuscript first before you can look it up! Think of it like a dictionary for manuscripts, if you're looking at a manuscript described as an octavo, you can look it up and find the definition in this book. On the other hand, if you're looking at a manuscript and have no idea what an element on the page is called, you're out of luck.I was hoping the book would be a breakdown of manuscripts by their parts in a more educational formats, but alas, that is not the case. This book is for you if you have the technical terms presented to you and you are needing the definition.That said, it's got great information and wonderful illumination examples inside. I'll be keeping the book anyway."
5,Affordable Book on Roman Military clothing,"This book has interesting reviews at Roman Army Talk. I liked the book but some will not agree with some of the tunic color theory. The book is really helpful for those who want to build an authentic re-enactor outfit, including information on the different styles of military shoes! The information about tunic construction and cloak types is invaluable. The color plates are nice, and realistic looking, while the line drawings and B&W illustrations are very good supporting materials. It is wonderful that this information is being made available in this format, and further volumes will follow!If you study Romans, the Roman Army, or re-enact this time period you will want this resource close at hand. Even miniatures painters can benefit from the information presented."
5,Fantastic Ideas for every period and personality,I have emjoyed this book immensely at first reading. I bought it inorder to make the modern livingroom featured in the back of the book. The pictures are fantastic and clear and almost lifesize. The directions for making the furniture and accessories are concise and readable. The author really took the time to tell us how to create the same beautiful rooms she herself built and decorated. Bravo to the author and her photographer! My favorite rooms next to the modern livingroom is the country kitchen and the red dinner. I am a fan of Kathy Dalmeny for life!
4,Interesting...,"this album has a distinct R&B/pop feel to it... very different from anything else PMG has done..for the most part it works quite well however.. particularly on songs such as ""Here To Stay"", ""And Then I Knew"", ""To the End of the World"", and ""Red Sky"".As a past reviewer said, this is a good album for someone who hasn't heard PMG before to get... the songs here should appeal to many.. not just PMG fans alone."
2,soooo disappointing,"no i dont like this cd, sure it got some nice tunes, but it's not the pat i used to know. It's no where near the output of for example ""the road to you"" which in my opinion is pat's greatest record all time together with ""travels"". pmg i s a live band and the studio cuts just don't do the trick. back to this record, i think there's too much experimenting with modern hip hop kinda rythms, which all in all end up silly. ""red sky"" has a nice tune, you know the ""infinite-loop"" that could be repeated again and again and again kinda tune that pat do so well, just like ""song for bilbao"" or in the end of ""third wind"", but then it doesn't do much more than that. too bad, i think they could have done so much more than simply adding what sounds like synth trumpets. no i'd skip this cd if i was you. ..."
2,Disappointing PMG album,"WE LIVE HERE is the most disappointing of all the Pat Metheny Group albums in that it is full of cookie-cutter, jazz fusion fluff and watered down, relatively uninteresting melodies -- Pat is capable of so much more. I can honestly say that none of the tunes really grab me. ""Here to Stay"" is fairly standard, upbeat Metheny -- what one might deem the ""hit single"" from the album -- but even this pales in comparison to other songs on PMG albums. It feels like Metheny and Co. were simply going through the motions on this album. Following Pat's accomplished solo album SECRET STORY (one of his all-time best) which was a should-have-been PMG album, WE LIVE HERE is just not up to the same standards."
5,We Live Here= FANTASTIC,"This is the greastest jazz album ever. If you are a die hard jazz music fan you must listen to track #4(To The End of The World), which I now consider my theme song.There isn't a day I don't listen to this song and I GA-RON-TEE after you listen to To The End of The World you'll be hooked too."
4,i wished i live here,Once again pat & lyle create a collection of sounds for every occasion and emotion. If you know pat and lyle then you don't need telling that this cd is tops. I just wished I lived here too. Performing in London a few years ago the crowd were treated to an extended version of we live here and are u going with me. Two great PM classics. Play this album and realise the meaning of life!
4,"""To the end of the World"" worth the $$$","I'm not to much of a Pat Metheny fan but the cut ""To the end of the World"" makes this CD worth the price. This cut shows what a talented artist Metheny really is and that he can truly create a lot of emotion from his music. I'd consider this CD a ""must have""!"
1,IT'S NOT THE SAME!!,"The original 7oz.Milk and Honey Body Lotion, as advertised, is not what was sent to me. The lotion, as well as the botttle, are different than advertised. The old formula was non-greasy,was absorbed into the skin quickly and smelled very good. The original was so smooth and grease-free, I could even use a little before playing guitar, if my hand was too dry. The new 8oz.lotion sent to me was greasy, tacky and it seemed to never go away. Do you know how packing grease feels? Yucky is the best way I can describe it. I'll NEVER use it. Making it orange doesn't help either; more yuck! I've been buying up all the old formula I can get my hand on, but eventually I'll have to find another lotion to use. I think it's pretty crappy, but others may love it. Like they say, if it's not broken..... Hey, life goes on."
5,Love it!,I love the smell of this lotion and how natural it is. It doesn't take forever to soak into your skin either. I only use this brand of lotion for our family and we all love it!
3,totally so-so 80's,"Half good, half bad. The good half however is really good. The songs by Quarterflash, Madness, and Debbie Harry are all classic 80's. But it's ""Emotion in motion"" by Ric Ocasek, and ""No more words"" by Berlin that makes this collection well worth the two bucks I got it for used. Would you pay full price for a collection that nobody reviewed in seven years? Only if you want to Wang Chung tonight."
5,Great Pilates intro!,This is a great video to buy if you have been wondering what Pilates is all about. It's a perfect introduction. You will be hooked on Pilates by the end and want to do it again. The instructors are thorough and informative. Stick with these exercises and you'll see your body starting to transform.
5,Great Stress Reliever,"I used to get really sore muscles and even migraines from stress. This pilates video has significantly helped me reduce my stress level, and I no longer have muscle aches caused by stress. Not only that, I've noticed my abdominal muscles are stonger. I strongly recommend this video to anyone looking to reduce stress and get a good strength training workout at the same time."
5,Conveys Very Helpful Insight into Pilates Movements,"I really enjoy this DVD because of the insight the instructors deliver into a ""fully functional"" workout that makes me feel so much more balanced and flexible. My range of motion really has improved and this DVD does an excellent job in learning the basic movements of pilates and, more importantly, why these exercises work so well. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who in interested in learning more about pilates."
5,Great Workout with Great Instruction,"After reading the review for this DVD in Pilates Style Magazine, I thought that I would give it a try. Other videos that I have purchased didn't really give me the instruction and understanding that made for an efficient pilates workout. Discovering Pilates was different. This video felt as if Jon Belanger was in your living room personally helping you through each move. He gives you a comprehensive understanding of pilates and one hell of a workout! I would recommend Discovering Pilates to anyone at any skill level. You WILL feel these workouts the next day!"
3,"Better for learners than ""continuers""","While this is a solid instructional DVD, the instruction gets old once you can perform the techniques on your own. You end up doing extra repetitions or just stretching while the teachers explain the movements yet again. For something you can work out to on a regular basis, the fast-moving ""Classical Pilates Technique"" (mat workout) is a better choice. Either that or you could search for a DVD that has an instructional track and a workout-only track."
1,These reviews have doubtful legitimacy.,"I hate to be unfair and give a product I haven't actually bought a review, but I feel as if I should give other viewers of this product a caveat. Plus, a 1 star will hardly make a dent to the 86 out of 90 5 star ratings this has.Look at the reviews. Pages upon pages of 2 to 3 lines reviews from accounts that have NO other activity (reviews or wish list). Not real-name confirmed, not verified purchases, EXTREMELY similar writing styles. These are very clear-cut patterns and shocking disparities between these reviews and the reviews on other Pilates DVDs.Rather suspicious, isn't it? I was really excited to buy this DVD after looking at the great ratings, but not anymore. This kind of shady manipulation is intensely off-putting to me, and I hope it will be to other would-be purchasers of this DVD as well."
4,Discovering pilates,"If you are looking for a challenging pilates dvd, this is the one for you. I have to stop the dvd and take breaks while doing it. He explains every position VERY clearly for good form and also gives you modifications. He has a very calm voice. I am only giving it 4 stars because it is very basic when it comes to background and enthusiasm. It basically shows John and a younger girl performing the exercises. I prefer Ana Caban's beach scenes, Hilary Burnett's calming candle room or something more upbeat and enthusiastic like Mari Winsor's Bun & Thigh sculpting. It's a good workout though if you don't need all the frills. You'll feel it the next day!Allison"
3,"Not really ""user friendlY""","While the instrucitons were clear on the video, each segment does a demonstration before you follow along... while this is useful when you do it the first couple of times, once you know the tips and demonstration throughly, it's not really necessary. Would be nicer if there was a separate video where you just do all the moves, without the pauses for the demos in between."
5,Quick and Easy to use Medical Drug Spelling Guide,"I am a medical transcriptionist and have found Instant Drug Index to be a very helpful tool. It is quick and easy to locate the spelling of a drug without going into detaile r information relating to the drug . For instant results when typing, it is invaluable. With the generic and propietary distinction it is easy to tell if the particular drug name needs to be capitalized or not. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a transcriptionist or medical typing specialist."
5,Best I have used yet.,"I have purchased many rechargeable batteries for the things I have and do. With regular rechargeable batteries as many know you loose power from the time you charge them.With Hybrio power loss is a thing of the past. Charge them today and 6 months from now you can use them in your device. I have both flavors that are available, AA and AAA. They charge just fine in any NiMh battery charger. They are very good in the cold (I use them in motion detection cameras in the woods) and like NiMh they discharge by using up the amp hours rather than loosing volts. When they are nearly used up they still show 1.2 volts on my battery checker. Whereas alkaline show voltages of less than .8 volts. You will like them, give them a try."
2,Not as Advertised,"Product label says ""Leaves No Residue"" which is false. While it did clean my floor, it left a sticky film that made it appear as if you were walking on a tacky matt. Re-cleaned the floor using Bona which removed the film and left the floor smooth to the touch and to the feet."
3,For Office & Retail Investors Only,"I was looking for a book on residential real estate investment, especially something on apartment buildings and how to figure value, such as using gross rent multipliers. I was disappointed. I needed to know current tax law on capital gains and some info on exchanges. The word 1031 is not found in this book. I was glad to see LLCs were included, but the information was vague since it had to apply to all states. Be warned: This book deals only with office and retail real estate investment. You will not find any information on apartments or single family rentals. If that is your interest, you definitely need a different book."
1,Complete Idiot's Guide to Real Estate Investing,"This book was very scattered. I got a few old books out of the library (Getting Started in Real Estate Investing and The Real Estate Book). They were very old but much more helpful than this idiot's guide. I am sending it back. It wasn't helpful for a novice like me. And I doubt that people that really know what they are doing would be helped either. Many subjects that I wanted advice in were not covered. Often the author would title a category or chapter with something I needed to know, but then he would not really delve into the subject or answer my most basic questions."
2,weak,"unlike the reviewer below, i kind of like the gospel version of ""dream on."" it's cheesy and doesn't have the soul of real gospel, but it still plays well with the lyrics: ""maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away."" but yeah, this is bad. none of the spark of the originals. it's filled with tepid blues-rock that's so prevalent these days. it did, however, make me realize how good a blues album by aerosmith could be."
1,only one good song...,"Sweet Emotion, Dream On are good songs but this style is some kind of wierd glam/blues rock and it's not very palatible.Some decent guitar work by Joe Perry, vocals are allright - just not my style."
4,Body in Berkeley Square,"Good twists and turns. Some good surprises. The story draws on the last book, so it is best to read the series in order."
2,great novel,This book was well written with great character development. The author has a good vocabulary and using it throughout the book. Look forward to the new book in the series
2,Yawn...yawn...yawn.,"I have read the previous Captain Lacey novels and, overall, find them entertaining. I looked forward to this one, but I am only halfway through (after two weeks!) and find myself bored. This book, in my opinion, is a slow-moving, dull, actionless yawn. Not her best work. The characters are lifeless, as if Lacey is bored, too. I may not waste anymore time trying to finish this thing."
1,Waste of money,"I thought the tape was a terrible waste of money. I felt like the techniques she suggested were ludicrous and that I had just wasted an hour of my life listening to it. First, for example, the author/spokeswoman on the tape suggests using the subject of sex to get someone's attention so they will listen to you. As I'm sure that would work, there are other, more intelligent, ways of getting someone's attention and communicating effectively with him or her. Then, she gives the listner an example of how she validated herself and blew off some steam after having a very bad day by firing a gun into the radiator with two other people in the room. This sounds more like she should have taken a trip to the therapist's office for some anger/grief management.I think the general population has better communication skills than what is taught on this tape. Don't waste your time or money. Spend an hour doing something more productive."
1,1 Hour of heck,I poped in the audio tape and was ready to hear a conversation about conversation. What I got was a bunch of gibberish from some hippie.She kept on having a one way conversation with a friend in the audience about anything but communicating.It was annoying and now I have a humungous head ache. I plan to return the book and get my money back. Believe me...DON'T BUY THIS BOOK/AUDIO TAPE!
2,Why so many 5 stars? This is a pity! :-(,"The razor-sharp axework of the excellent guitarist Karl Logad and the sincerity of Manowar's themes don't save this CD. Eric Adams vocals and Joey DeMaio boring bass lines actually ruin this album, which should never be compared to the high flies of ""Kings Of Metal"" and ""Fighting The World"". If you want to explore Manowar, take the aforementioned albums instead of this one. What happened to Adams' voice? It sounds broken, finished... It's a shame listening him, as you won't identify this voice with the one that sang ""Stand And Fight!"". Drumming is also second-class rated -Well, I admit that Manowar had never had a extra-class drummer. The production is flat, and the sound is outdated and unexciting. I can't stand so much monotony! Why so many 5 stars? Go for something better and do yourself a favor: overall, this is a poor album, and I encourage you to avoid purchasing it. Two stars is by far a gift to this release!"
3,king of metal keepin' metal alive,"Manowar can make a record completely loyal to their fans anytime, everytime. Through tragedy and discomfort they have emerged as one of the most loyal metal bands, and this record pays tribute to their tenacity. With songs like courage and return of the worlord, Manowar shows us they can still blow our brains out and have us coming back for more. For anyone that wants to return to a time when courage was everthing, purchace this record."
5,manowar is the loudest and the best.,"manowar is one of those bands that likes to make your ears ring for days. even their ballads kick rump and take notice. they are not in the guinness book of world records for no reason. they should not only be in there for being the loudest, but also being the best. warsaw in"
1,Don t bother,Bought this one to because I saw them live and they played some songs I never heard so like a fan I wanted to crank out to more manowar tunes but did not care for this release and I based it on the amazon reviews pros vs cons I guess from now on I'll download music before i buy instead of basing my choice on others.just have to listen some more maybe I ll like one song from album
2,"Their worst album till now - 2,5 stars","Its not only their worst album its an album that i don't like any song. I am a Manowar fan and i like very much all their albums (except Fighting the world which is just ok). Guys don't waste your time in this album , its just for Manowar Collectors. If you are new check The triumph of steel and Kings of metal."
2,"If you buying this for reading plesure, forget it","In advance, sorry fo he typos my keyboard is messed up.This is not for those who read for fun. Cone states in 10 pages what most could in haf a page He uses te extra space to ramble and rant. He contiuley repeats himself over and over , like a broken record player.For learning purposes, I recomend going to a libray and photo copying the valuable sections of the book. If your a teacher lookng to make sheets from this book, hen geta diffrnt book.Speaking as a pupil, students would rather not plough through this long winded babble"
2,Is this really black theology?,"I read this book trying to understand Obama's mind set. After all he attended this church for 20 years. I found a lot of hatred towards non-blacks, especially whites and a lot of misguided anger towards all whites. This book was disturbing and hopefully does not represent the opinion of all blacks. But I have to conclude that it does represent the views of a man who could possibly be the President of the United States. No one can deny that blacks have suffered and still do suffer from racism in this country. As a white woman I totally disagree with Mr. Cones' claim that whites are raised from birth to hate blacks. That statement is absolutely false."
4,3/4 Of Refused.. that will get your attention.,"Everyone from Refused except Dennis (the vocalist). They're about as different as can be from Refused, but these songs were going to be on the new Refused album, but they thought, ""what are we doing? this isn't refused!"". Some songs are weird, although enjoyable. I don't know if I'd reccomend it to fans of Refused because they are so different in sound. Great cd none the less."
3,"Instead of this book, how about....","Seems to be va bene, perhaps if purchased alone, more as a refresher??I've read other rewiews from other sites, and it seems that the CD lessons don't always match what the book is reading.I would suggest ""The Everything Learning Italian Book"" (speak, write, and understand basic Italian in no time) By Michael P. San Filippo, it's what I'm using currently, and I have learned a lot in, well, no time!! (as it promises!)I've even had trouble with things such as verbs, adverbs, ajectives and the such, in English!! And I speak English! lol but this book even took care of my probs with this language, and I'm excelling greatly in Italian so well, I've even impressed myself! (not to mention my fiance' who's Sicilian).So although it may be ok as a refresher, or a book to keep on hand (since it's smaller) for words you're stumped on, I'd still suggest the above, it's affordable wherever you purchase it, and extremely helpful as well."
4,exceptionally good for price range,"For the $10-15 price range, these are fine...I bought a pair for $12 somewhere and am going to order about 20 more to add sound to some office computers.Very low profile, very light, kind of a classic look...not ""incredible"" sound, but I've heard worse in some $50 speakers. Blue power light brighter than any LED I've ever seen...that might irritate you a little."
1,Simply unacceptable!,I just got these at a local store and they just really blow!!! I was swayed by the brand name and the great price (although higher than Amazon). It's true when they say you get what you pay for... rock-bottom price = rock-bottom performance. Terrible to say the least. Mine are going back right now.
5,No issues.,"We got this for my sister-in-law and brother-in-law a while ago. They've been using it and said they loved it. I don't know what else to ask for, since it worked as advertised and the price was right."
2,It Broke!,"The blanket was delivered in speedy time, but after two used, it no longer heats. I emailed the company seven days ago and they haven't responded.Thumbs down, big time."
5,NIGHTMARE FOR THE HOLIDAY,"This is a great book! researched exhaustively,and for 30 years the author writes this as if you are marching right beside the doomed column.You can hear the shuffle of the feet feel the tension as they march to their deaths,and above all you feel the forlorn hope diminish with each passing hour. A GREAT GREAT BOOK. A MASTERPIECE! I CANNOT PRAISE THIS TOO HIGHLY! A great book on a forgotten time and place. WISH TED TURNER would make this into a TNT ORIGINAL MOVIE!And follow the truth of the format. A VERY GOOD STORY!"
3,Light delights,"Fusion fans won't fuss, but as agreeable as this meeting is there seems to be an essential ingredient missing that keeps the cooking at a gentle simmer."
3,By Rock and Pool,"I have not read this book, it is archived for the moment. It looks very interesting but a little involved for me right now. Sorry"
4,"Great for skin, bad for nose","I've tried some of the other sunblock sprays, but they've stung my face. This one doesn't, but the ""fragrance"" is such a strong perfume-like smell, it's not very pleasant at all. And I'm not sensitive to most smells, except for cigarette smoke and car exhaust."
5,Lay It Down - Cowboy Junkies True Classic,"If you are a casual fan of the band you have probably heard of The Trinity Sessions, which is also a great CD. But if you can own only one make it Lay It Down. From the local hit single ""A Common Disaster"" to the less known beautiful songs like ""Something More Beside You"" this is a CD that once you listen to a few times, you won't be able to stop."
5,Best CJ album so far,"I was very pleasantly surprised to see the positive reviews for Lay It Down. I have everything in the catalog and am very much a fan of the Junkies. I have never written a music review, but can clearly say that this album is the best one they have ever made. By far. Trinity sessions is a second. The rest of the studios are not at the level of this. It seems to me that this album was made with an intensity and effort that surpasses the rest."
3,"3 1/2, going on 4","I like _Lay It Down_ but have never found it as interesting or listenable as _Black-Eyed Man_ or as haunting as _the Trinity Session_. It's still a good album, though."
5,It breaks my heart ...,"So it's true! I HAVE died and gone to Heaven! After years of weeding through track after track of some of the most truly dreadful ""commercial"" dreck imaginable, I came up with a copy of ""the Trinity Sessions"" ... yes, I know, that is not this CD, but it IS how I came to be at this point. ""Trinity"" is the ""live"" disc, and most albums presented that way leave me hollow. I don't know why, and I really don't care. But ""Trinity"" was good enough for me to latch onto ""Lay It Down"".This CD tears me up...I'm inclined toward being kinda nasty when being critical, but not here, not now. This is beautiful in every way that music can be beautiful. This is no ""child of"" band ... although something like it might be born of unions between the Doors, Dave's True Story and maybe Nirvana ... this band is (so far) the clearest, brightest facet of contemporary music that has entered through my ears in a very, VERY LONG time."
4,Great introspective listen,"I first heard this CD while I was in Atlanta, Georgia in April 1996. I was there for business and heard ""Common Disaster"" on the Radio-96X. I picked up the CD and listened to it for three days straight as I drove around the city.It hits home with ""Just Wanna See"" and ""Bea's Song"" because of the real thought and feeling provoking lyrics and subtle, supporting guitar and drums.""Common Disaster"" got the most airplay, but there is much more to this CD. Invite a few GOOD friends over, throw in this CD and enjoy it. I can tell the band did."
4,George Beverly Shea Chrismas albumn,"My parents bought this Christmas albumn for the family back in the late 50's or early 60's and I loved it and still do. It had a powerful and almost mystical effect on me as a child, partly because of the choice of Christmas caroles, some of which were spirituals. Although it may be ""dated"" that's what makes it so special. George Beverly Shea is not known to most people, but he had a deep rich voice that was was very powerful and evocative."
3,uhhh,"Dude, it is a little odd to see a pak with two bad face scans.It should be 2 1/2 but paul londonds first toy gets some extra credit, The Kidman is better in the best of WCW. still awsome pipe."
2,Don't expect too much from this book,"In my opinion, the methods shown in this book do not work well enough to recommend this book. Especially the method for the S&P which is perhaps the only real market for day-trading leads to overtrading. Also the money management techniques presented are not effective.If you use a third contract set only to cover costs you are increasing your risk (and of course your costs) by 50%!Such a technique would only work if you were able to liquidate this contract set at least in 80% of the time at a win which won't be the case with the presented methods.Also a 250$ stop in the S&P is almost always sure to be hit. Also the use of 'stop with limit' and MIT- orders is no longer applicable. It might be true that the presented methods worked 10 years ago, but i don't think they are still working. Therefore the book is highly overpriced."
3,WAY TOO OVERPRICED,"There are a lot of helpful ideas in this book, and may have been new and special at the time Mr. Ross developed them. But these basic concepts have been expressed over and over again in other more reasonably priced offerings. As a matter of fact, most of what is in this book is available for free at the author's website.I do not think the cost warrants what is really just a breakout system from a congestion area."
2,Very difficult reading. Not for beginners at all...,I found the reading very tough and intensive. I have zero knowledge in stock market and thought I give this book a try. It was too much to understand. I don't really think I could invest real money and do my own trading. I haven't gained any useful knowledge by reading this book.
4,An *almost* perfect compilation,"This is a collection of some of Don Henley's greatest work. Like a lot of people, I was disappointed with the absense of ""Johnny Can't Read"" and ""A Month of Sundays"". I would've also liked to have heard ""Land of the Living"" make the cut. However, upon greater reflection, I realized that this was a greatest *hits* album, and not a greatest *songs* album. If my favorite songs never became singles, it's not the album's fault. My advice is to get this album filled with Don Henley's greatest singles, if not all his greatest songs."
1,Disappointment,"I never got my order. The seller cancelled the transaction. Apparently he advertises items he does not have. Not only did he cancel my order after recieving payment, he didn't even have the courtesy to contact me and let me know what was happening. I understand this is an excellant CD, only I don't have one to listen to!"
3,say what??,"How can you have a BEST OF Don Henley without ""Dirty Laundry"" and/or ""Johnny Can't Read""?? (DOH!)"
3,Actual Miles CD,"I bought the CD to get ""Boys of Summer"" It was up to my expectations and I was overall satisfied."
3,Typical Greatest hits collection,"The title says it all. This album has neither the depth or the flow of either ""Building the Perfect Beast"" or ""Inside Job"" and in fact contains nothing off of ""Inside Job"" which to me is Henley's best solo album. It don't sound like Henley was involved in the production at all. It's better than listening to the radio. But you're better off buying the real Don Henley albums for the gems that don't make it to a greatest hits album"
2,Actual Miles: Henley's Greatest Hits,"After shipping charges were added to the already inflated cost of the CD, I could have bought two CDs from WalMart. Also, received with a crack in the hard plastic case and CD was loose inside, rattling around. This doesn't to appear to have effected the integrity of the CD, but was still not a great way to receive something you paid for, expecting new product and it is beat up."
2,TOO BAD THEY DON'T STILL SELL 45'S,"It's hard to put down an artist whom I admire--and maybe it isn't Henley's fault, but as is the case with many CD's (albums/compilations), the stuffing is often also the turkey.Simply put---I should have downloaded the hits and left it at that. To my ears, there was nothing of any great value or significance other than those. Yes, the liner notes are there, and that holds some interest--but this case isn't filled with jewels.Since I'm selling mine on this site the review is contrary to my own best interests, but that's not unusual--poor people often vote Republican."
4,Don Henley - Decent Career Overview With Two Great New Songs,"I'm not really sure why I picked this up. I already have 9 of the 12 songs on the original studio albums. Only the big hit ""Dirty Laundry"" and the two new tracks ""The Garden Of Allah"" and ""You Don't Know Me At All"" are tracks I did not already own. The two new tracks are both very good, with ""The Garden Of Allah"" particularly a standout track. Henley plays the devil in modern day Los Angeles. This is great stuff and an example of Henley at his best. ""You Don't Know Me At All"" is another solid tune. There is also a cover of ""Everybody Knows"" thrown on to the end of the album, although it does not appear on the back cover. I don't know if this is worth buying for the new songs alone if you already have Henley's 3 studio discs up to this point in his career, but this is a nice compilation if you are just looking for an overview."
4,Actually like his solo stuff more...,"Love these songs, and the new ones are an ok addition, but I was disappointed that ""JOHNNY CAN'T READ"" & one of the greatest duets of all time-""LEATHER & LACE"" with Stevie Nicks were not included. Couldn't GEFFEN spring for the licensing for these 2 to also be included. (FYI-On Stevie's box set, the song has an extra line sung by Don.) Can't wait til INSIDE JOB comes out in May-hopefully THIS May!"
5,recent purchase,"I was very pleased with the cd I purchased. It was used, but in very good condition. I can't see spending a large price for a new cd when I can purchase the same cd used and in real good condition. I think that it is great that I can buy used cd's from Amazon.com at a very reasonable price."
4,Surprisingly heartfelt music,"Don Henley's solo career has been full of hearttfelt, lyrical, insightful music. Compare this music with the solo career of Don's Eagles writing partner, Glenn Frey and you'll see that Don is the better lyricist.This collection is dissapointing in that it leaves out two tasty soundtrack tunes- ""Sit down your rocking the boat "" from LEAP OF FAITH, and ""Love Rules"" from FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH."
5,Fantastic after all these years!,"I had forgotten what a great singer Don Henley was by himselft until I heard one of these songs on the radio. It stuck in my head, I ordered it and the whole CD took me back. I love this CD!"
4,A Solid Hit...,"...because I'm a hit or miss Henley fan; the stuff I like I absolutely love, the rest I can take or leave; this is a good compilation, all erudite snobbery aside. If you like Don Henley and want a best of collection, this is it. How complicated is that?"
5,Continue to love it!,It's a great body of work! I continue to listen to it and love it over the years and never tire of the songs...
3,Very good fiction,"Pretty well written; house seems very spooky. Too bad it was touted as ""non-fiction""."
5,a terrifying TRUE story,"THIS BOOK WAS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.I AM A TRUE BELIEVER IN THE PARANORMAL,AND I JUST HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY THIS STORY IS A HOAX 'CAUSE IT'S NOT! I HAVE DONE ALOT OF RESEARCH ON THIS STORY AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT'S MORE THAN LIKELY VERY TRUE! AND IN MY RESEARCH THE LUTZ FAMILY WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES THAT ENCOUNTERED STRANGE PHENOMENA AT THAT HOUSE,THERE HAVE BEEN MANY OTHER ENCOUNTERS WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN TO 112 OCEAN AVENUE.GO TO AMITYTALK@AOL.COM AND YOU WILL BE CONVIENCED THAT THIS IS A TRUE STORY!TO BAD THIS BOOK IS OUT OF PRINT,BUT IT SHOULD BE EASY TO FIND AT A USED BOOK STORE. READ IT...BE TERRIFIED...READ IT AGAIN..."
2,Never let facts get in the way of a good story,"What a laughable book. Despite having been debunked before the 1970s even ENDED, people persist on saying this book is based on true events. Well, to a point it is. There was a mass murder in the house on Ocean Avenue in 1974, and a family by the name of Lutz did move into the house in December of 1975 and then leave after 28 days but that's about the extent of the truth. Had this book told of the strange ""events"" that the Lutz's allegedly encountered in an exciting manner, it would have been more enjoyable. As it is, what we're stuck with is a book that's surprisingly dull for long stretches and lacks the real punch that a ghost story could have; this failing also infected the sluggish 1979 film version. The dialogue is poorly written and the book still has typos from the original printing. Read it for the historical perspective but don't expect an especially great read."
5,One excellent and suspencefull book,This book was so detailed and scary that I could not read it at night by myself. The book was full of suspence and the unexpected is to be expected from this book. It was a wonderful book. Don't read this book alone!!!
3,Not as scary as I remembered,"I remember this book as being positively horrorific. I wouldn't even sleep in the same room with it. Now that I am an older person, I found this book a lot less scary. The only part that really made me jump was the end. It is an interesting book, especially in the annals of ""true"" stories of hauntings, but it just wasn't the leap out of your skin scary story that I remembered. The writing has a certain pedestrian quality to it, serviceable, but not exciting. It is really hard to find a good haunted house book/novel. This is ok."
3,Jumpy...but for the wrong reasons,"I finally got a hold of this book. After seeing the movies, I wanted to get what I thought was the ""whole"" story as books often include more information than film. What I got..not only disappointed me in the book but also made me actually disappointed in the films (Including the remake). The book jumped too much from one scenario to another, leaving me, what felt like, in the wide open for another attack of useless jabber. The subject of the book is wonderful, and should be a little soul shaking. As far as I'm concerned, there were no real creepy sections, and I felt like I was reading an elementary grade school horror novel that you find on the ""Halloween"" themed shelf in the school library. The story of this book had the makings to be deeply disturbing, but all I ended up with was about a five hour reading session with no real memory of anything that transpired in the book."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Very ordinary dodgy haunted house fare. A made up story about a made up house that does some rather bizarre things, but all in all it is fairly tame and not overly suspenseful, for those fans of things horror. You can certainly get better elsewhere."
4,meh,"The story was good, but the movie was definitely scarier. Most books are able to paint a better tale than a film, but not in this instance. Obviously it's supposedly a true event, but the way the details were shared was kind of disjointed and not very engaging."
4,Interesting,"This was an interesting read about true events. I liked the matter-of-fact writing style. Very straight-forward. After reading the book, I did a little research of my own to look into what happened. Fascinating.Recommended."
4,SCARY yet I couldn't put the book down,Wow! This is one of the scariest books I have ever read. Saw the made for TV movie back in the 70's or maybe the 80's. Am thrilled that I am not part of the Lutz family. The author has really developed his craft.
4,good book whether the story is true or not,"Pretty creepy book though the validity of the story is debatable. Super easy to read and hard to put down, I really enjoyed this book and finished in one evening at work. Written as absolutley factual, the story behind the story is pretty interesting and worth researching. Read it with an open mind, either way it's a good horror story!"
4,not true but entertaining,"As a kid when i read this book it came out in 1976. I didnt believe in anything supernatural , but this book came out and said it was true. so being 16 and skeptical i read it and got real scared. then a week later i read in the paper how the lutz family took the tragedy of the defeo family murders for profit, i was fooled but now i know better.i hate to say this cos i dont believe in ghosts or anything as a psycic, but the ammityville conspircy is a interesting read on the phoniness of the lutzs.anyone who says they could talk to the dead is lying. they take advantage of lonely people.george lutz went on abc to still say the story was true and the reporter didnt even bring up the conspircy book.well all b.s aside it is fun and fast to read but it isnt true."
1,Spooky Fiction,"If this book was sold as a novel, I'd give it 4 stars. But this entire incident (the ""haunting"") has been proven to be a cruel hoax. There was horror in Amityville alright, but it involved the murder of six people in 1974. How disgusting to dupe so many people just to make a buck."
1,"Anson may have believed, but we know better now.","Total hoax: what more needs be said? Even before I read that the Lutz' supposedly concocted the whole story over a couple of bottles of wine, I found the story within to be more of an 'annoyance' than a 'horror'; even as fiction it wouldn't have scared me. If you want to read something REALLY scary, ignore Barnes' review and try ""Hunt for the Skinwalker""."
3,Famous hoax; fun book anyway,"Seeing how many people are talking about this as though the story is true, follow this link for the real story about how the attorney for murderer Ronald DeFeo Jr. has admitted that he and the Lutz family made up the story one drunken evening:[...]That said, it is a fun book for horror fans. Real people, not a real story."
2,All right for a work of fiction claimed as truth,"It scared me more as a child, when I thought the story was true. After discovering it was a hoax, the story's ability to frighten me lessened until now, I find the whole thing laughably silly. And look what happenedto George and Kathy Lutz for all that!"
4,[Un]Truely a Horror Story,"I have actually only recently finished this book. I have to say that I stayed up until 3am last Snday morning reading it. I couldn't put it down!Although, as far as I can remember, this story has been disproven, I still found it a scary read and somewhere in the back of my mind there was a part of me that kept telling me it was real.In part I put that down to the author, who relates the story in such a way that it is completely believable. His prose style is such that it adds a air of ""menace"" to the story which leaves the reader wanting to know what happened.If you've seen the film(s) and think you know the story, think again. the films do not do the story justice and there are more scares in the book that in the films.If you have an interest in the ""goings-on"" at 112 Ocean Avenue, then buy this book and read. It may not change your mind, but it's an entertaining read, none the less."
4,Way Better Than The Movie,"I had already seen the movie, and I saw the book for sale for only 2 bucks, so I picked it up. I thought the book was a lot better and different than the movie, but I didnt find it all that scary. I guess part of the books scariness is that fact that its BASED ON A REAL STORY..... I did find it very creep and very well written. If you plan on watching the new movie comming out in April, read the bok first... its pretty short and will make a good afternoon read."
5,perfect,"Came in as new. Thanks so much for the quick turn aroundI'd been searching for this book for some time, and our local library was getting tired of me requesting inter-library loans once a year"
3,not a bad read,i found the book to be better than the movie it keep's you on the edge of your seat well done
5,This book will continue to haunt you for a long time!,"""The Amityville Horror,"" one of the most intriguing and interested books I have read in a long while, has stayed to haunt me since I've read the book over a year ago. I still think of ""Jodie"" and those haunting ""red eyes in the window."" What made the book even scarier was fact that this was a supposed ""true story."" Also, the fact that so many elements of the story remain unexplained, even AFTER you read the epilouge. (What does the green goo have to do with ANYTHING?) I highly recommend visiting the house (112 Ocean Avenue) before they tear it down. (I live ten minutes away, so its easy for me.) But what I don't recommend is reading this book at night!"
2,Good fiction,"This book is not true, contrary to all those who believe in this nonsense. The Amityville Horror was proven a hoax almost from the beginning. However, it is a good horror story if you read it for what it is- fiction."
2,"great story, bad read","The story itself is great...very intriguing, but Anson does a horrible job of telling it. It's incredibly mechanically written and nearing the end of the book, he actually starts ending each chapter with an exclamation point, which is the definition of cheesy.This may be the only book in history where the movie is of higher quality."
5,Amityville Horror,Book came in on time and in excellent condition. Very satisified as I could not find this book in any stores even the big name book stores. Amazon as usual came through!
4,A very interesting read,"Like many of you, I have seen the movie and, I really enjoyed it.The book is more detailed and thorough. The occurances happening at the Amytiville House are very well described, making it an interesting read.Whether it is read as a fiction or as a true life occurance, it is an easy, fast and enjoyable read.But I tend to think, after having met people who were in the surrounding of the Lutz family, that it is a true story in most of the lines;Like we say sometimes, ""Where is smoke there is fire"".In any case, whether the story is true or not, I would recommend it to all Horror and Haunting fans, like me!"
5,"Whether or not this book is ""the truth"", SOMETHING happened","My grandmother was living in Levitown, Long Island, at the time of the Amityville incident. She heard about some peculiar occurrence at that Amityville house even before Mr. Anson even began writing this book. People everywhere in that area knew something had happened. Whether or not this book is in fact a full account of what actually happened (""the truth"") hardly matters. The Lutz family, one way or another, firmly believed that the incidents they described had actually happened - and *that* is all that matters.All said and done, this book in itself is what it is: a book. Read it as you may want to perceive it, fiction or otherwise, it was written by someone who wasn't in that house but who was doing their best to show to the world what they thought had occurred. Fiction or not, it's a pretty da(r)n scary story."
3,a good book,"666 is anson's masterpiece. this is only a good book. events in plentiful. plot interesting. simple style. more a book for a younger audience i believe. a family moves in a house where something evil lurks. stuff happens. well enough, but not masterly in any way by description, psychology etc. the problem is perhaps the ""true story""-angle. i believe, i know, that anson could have made more out of it (as 666 proves). the story simply fails at times too (e.g.: in the beginning we are led to believe that the mother will be seriously disturbed and that it will have great impact, not true). a good read. classic? why?"
4,Horror?,"This is a book about a very strange haunting. I enjoyed the content of the book, but it is not scary. I also felt that the style of writing was not as good as I would have hoped. Though nicely done, combining fact in a fictional style just doesn't work. I would have gone with one or the other."
2,Superficial,"Wanting to familiarize myself with Linux, and looking for a way to obtain an installation copy of Red Hat 7 on CD-ROM, I purchased this book.Unfortunately, I found that this book failed be the ""well-organized set of sessions"" that make up a teaching guide it claims to be. The choice of topics is not exactly what you want (why spend a session on listing calendar and calculator tools), and the topics hardly provide any concrete information (unless you find the statement that ""all you need is the predefined configuration files from this book's companion CD-ROMs"" enough to have ""learned how to use the mail server to exchange e-mail with other systems on the Internet""). It lacks depth, even for me as a first-time user.In summary, this book quickly shows many features of the Red Hat installation, but falls short of providing the insight required to get started.2 stars for providing Red Hat 7 on CD."
2,Barely scrachtes the surface,"This book is ok for anyone that has very little computer experience and, like the title says, has to learn Linux in a weekend. Anyone else should look elsewhere for an introduction. And with Linux distributions getter better and better at recognizing your hardware properly (in my case a brand new Dell 4100), I think more time should be spent on actually using Linux instead of installing it.There seems to be to few Linux books that cover the middle ground between novice users and experienced users. That's were I find myself and I found it difficult to find good quality books aimed at intermediates."
4,Daniel Boone - Volume 3 - The Wilderness Road,"Long before the West was won, Daniel Boone (Dewey Martin), the most famous frontiersman of them all, had a powerful itch to see Kentucky, the unexplored wilderness on the other side of the Cumberland Mountains. You won't want to miss a single episode of his action packed, suspense-filled journeys into uncartered territory.VOLUME THREE: THE WILDERNESS ROADAs Daniel leads the pioneers west in The Wilderness Road, they hear the one word that strikes fear into their hearts -- ""Indians!"" Crowfeather, Daniel's archenemy, has broken the peace and not only wants the pioneers to go home, he wants to fight Daniel!"
3,three and one-half stars,"not the equal of ""Saturation"" , but pretty darn good effort. The band progresses as songwriters here without going too goofy in any one direction. It's a real collection of oddball songs with UO's sense of humor still being forthright. ""Somebody else's Body"" ranks as the best effort on the album with a cool melody and slack-jawed arrangement, UO's out of tune guitars and wrong notes work very well again, this time a bit more tame than the all-out assault on the eardrums on ""Saturation"", ""Need some air"" lifts the melody from a popular Broadway musical number, ""Honesty Files"", ""this is No Place"" and ""The Mistake"" are new classics that one day will be discovered. Overall the album smacks with desparation and an edginess that few bands can commit to vinyl (or 100110010100110101011's)and that keeps you coming back for more listens. This album betters with age."
5,One of my alltime favorites,"I love how ""Exit the Dragon"" is always referred to as a colossal F-up. It is one of my personal favorite albums EVER. The jacket and interior pictures are awesome [especially the LP]. The story behind it and the fact that it got no promotion is interesting. And most importantly, the music is beautiful. It is one of the few albums I enjoy listening to front-to-back, side a-side b all the way through. They hit every mood, which is something very few albums accomplish. In fact, I think I'll go listen to it right now . . ."
3,only decaf jasmine green i could find,"this tea tastes OK, but doesn't really compare to the regular caffeinated stuff. i switched to decaf when i got pregnant and now for breastfeeding. i found that if i mixed in just a touch of the regular it made it much more palatable. this is the only decaf jasmine green tea that i could find anywhere. please let me know if there is another resource out there as i found this to be pricey for the taste."
2,Disappointed!,I had seen good reviews on their own site and here... was highly disappointed upon receiving this tea which has a strong grassy/green flavor and a very very light floral scent and taste that hardly resembles jasmine... the search goes on :-(
5,Effortless vocals,"Tangles is a very warm, touching album. SJ Tucker is amazingly talented. The tone of this album is whimsical and up-beat, even the unhappy songs (""Mary, Mary"" and ""Bad Apple Lament"") are surprisingly strong and positive. The music is deceptively simple, and very catchy. I find myself humming the tunes hours after I listen to the CD. The lyrics are complex, fun, and relatable.The more I listen to the songs, the more I like them, which is uncommon in most music these days. The songs aren't generic fluff, they're intimate and thoughtful. In some ways Tucker's style reminds me of Joni Mitchell or Fiona Apple. Creative, personal and emotionally powerful."
5,Outstanding sword fighting,"A long time collector of A class martial art films this one ranks among the top, I search all over the internet and stores coast to coast and overseas for the best in martial art films and this is a gem. This film has a good story the acting is well done and outstanding sword fighting, I'm also a fan of Norman Chu he plays the villian in this film. The price that I paid for this movie on amazon was a big gift when you consider what lesser quality films are asking."
5,Enjoyable sword actioner,"Yup, I agree with the other reviewers. This is an enjoyable classic sword drama and Adam Cheng an excellent chinese sword fencer. Even in 1979 Adam was television's favorite Chinese Wuxia Swordsman starring in many Hongknog TVB RTV ATV Sword dramas, Hongkong and Taiwan swordsman movies.One famous role is that of a Ming Dynasty wuxia robin hood type warrior called Chu Lu Xiang which Ti Lung took on for Shaw Brothers in SB Classic movies like 'Clans of Intrigue'. But mention Chu Lu Xiang to anyone in Hongkong or Southeast Asia and most will immediately recall Adam Cheng who played the swordsman in a 1980 50 episode TVB drama series.Here in this delightful actioner about a wandering swordsmen testing his skill against other wandering swordsmen, Adam Cheng shines. Damn fine blade work!"
4,Tips from Tuttle,"This is a well thought out and interesting introduction both to the craft of writing and the subject of fantasy and science fiction. The emphasis is away from so called "" hard "" sf and more towards what I call more imaginative or "" impossible"" fantasy writing. The book has been updated to include recent developments such as writing for the internet and includes more recent writers such as J.K. Rowling."
3,Not bad for the price...,"I purchased this book on the recommendation of George R. R. Martin.I thoroughly enjoyed his Song of Ice and Fire series (so far) and the author of this book is a former student of his, so I thought it was going to be golden.My expectations were somewhat lofty.The bottom line: if you want some good hints and general information, get this book. It has plenty for the price Amazon is asking.Don't expect this book to make you a top-notch writer though. No book can. As a previous reviewer stated: practice, practice, practice."
1,This book won't make you a great writer,"This book is far to general and abstract to make you a great writer. Something I liked about the book was the examples of how different writers used specific ""devices"" in their writing. I also liked the Q&A; with publishers at the end.Sadly though, the bulk of the book can be summarized as:Read a lot to keep up with the field andWrite a lot to get practice."
1,Knights But Not Templar,"Templar history, the real history not the fervid imaginings regarding the Holy Grail and such, is a truly fascinating tale worthy of sustained study. But as the previous reviewer has observed, however, all of the tales in this collection are instantly forgetable as they are trite in conception and poorly written. They have the collective depth of creative writing exercises in a first year class. I threw my copy away."
3,Textbook,"Prompt shipping, book was shrink wrapped and in excellent condition. Unfortunately I had to return this book as my professor changed editions AFTER I had already purchased this book."
1,Just Flat-out Aweful,This might actually be the worst recording of any genre of all time. This includes reggae and disco.
1,Where is the groove?,Slash obviously was not the reason GNR rocked with a groove. But I guess if you are a young male (read sexually frustrated) this is the bomb...
2,Worst slash album,"When ""It's Five O'Clock Somewhere"" starts it seems like it's going to be a fine album. the first two songs are cool, but after that the cd just loses momentum and most of the songs are just boring. the good songs on this cd are neither can i, a bluesy song that starts slow but builds up, dime store rock, a hard rockin song, take it away, another decent rocker and back and forth again, a ballad with an amazing solo. those are the only songs worth listening to. Slash is a great guitarist but even he can not save this cd. also the singer is pretty bad, he just sounds like an Axl impersonator. The second snakepit cd is much better and i would reccomend that one, but don't bother with this one."
1,Slash is coolest 80's G-tar player,"The coolist thing about this cd is that sinister cartoon snake on the cover.I can listen to ain't life grand,ssp's second release over and over again,that one I would give ten stars,this one I can't get through once.two different singers two different bands,get ain't life grand."
1,RAT!,"Don't read this book! Elia Kazan is a mediocre director and a rat fink! The only award he deserves is one for being a traitor and a snitch. They should call it ""The Elia Kazan Award For Cowardice."""
5,Sweet!,"A number of guitarists have left their bands to do solo work: Marty Friedman, Ace Frehley, Brian May, and Richie Sambora have even done so and produced some first rate material. Slash, with ""it's five o'clock somewhere,"" has set the standard."
4,Solid record...,"The only problem is, a few fillers weigh the album down.""Neither Can I"", ""Dime Store Rock"", ""Beggars and Hangers On"" and ""Back and Forth Again"" are all killer tracks..."
3,Slash knows his music,"It's not a bad cd if you like an old rock style. The singer sounds like a combo of Axl and Bon Jovi. My favorite song on this CD is ""back and forth again"". This song reminds me of a rock song from the late 80's. Anybody who plays a guitar should learn from Slash's style."
3,mixed feelings....,"Well this album was one that most people compare to GNR.. well that isnt the best thing to do. GNR cant be duplicated. Slash wasnt trying to do this, but how could you stay totaly away from something so successfull? Sure the vocals are weak at times and yes they even sound similar to Axl, but aside from that the album is a good solo album. It is more like a playground for Slash to dish out some killer solos. Slash does however need to convice his lead singer to work on vocals before the release of the new album.. Check out that last track on the cd.. Awsome..."
4,this rocks,wel i really like it. especailly back and for again. but i think it could use more solo`s.
4,gnr without axl,"Sounds like the GNR of old , around the ""Lies"" days. Some good old fashioned badass guitar riffs & vocals make this an album worth listening to more than once"
5,EXTREMELY BAD,"If the snakepit is a ""ryde,"" then I want to get off at the first stop or I might be sick."
1,HORRIBLE STUFF,"This disc gives the time ""5 o'clock"" A bad name. Whenever it's that time all I can think of is this horrible music."
1,This is pretty bad,"Just because it's five o'clock somewhere, it doesn't give Slash the right to release such an awfull disc."
1,Very Bad Indeed,"I am just a humble goat herder from Afghanistan. We do not get to listen to many cds here. We have very little money, and very little food. Many days it is hard to go on. An American Red Cross worker played me some American music, to make me happy and ease my immense suffering. She played this disc by your rock man Slash. It is atrocious. I would rather starve here in Afghanistan than listen to this horrible music. I would rather listen to the sounds of my goats going hungry than hear this. My country is in shambles and on the brink of civil war, but at least we have not produced anything of this awefullness."
1,Worst than you can imagine,Slash has such a horrible sound. It makes one think of Jeff Beck killing his cat.
3,Great Effort But not good enough,"I feel that this cd is good but my problem is that they should have waited and made it a guns n'roses album. A guns n' roses band without Axl Rose doing the vocals is just a plain old bad idea. This cd has great guitar tabs. I believe slash is one of the top lead/rythum guitar players of our time. If axl would have done the vocals it would have been a great compilation because thats' what this cd is, Gun's N' Roses but without Axl. Slash, good job, but next time get someone else to do vocals or hook up back with Gun's N' Roses and axl rose.Guns N' Roses Forever"
3,It's the message...,"This album is not as bad as some might say. There's blues...it's for the rockin depressed...who's in a dark hole, who's looking to get out, who's got questions...perhaps Slash and Co. were lookin to ease that pain. To give some sort of light. This album in my opinion, is great, great sounding and grreat in the way it moves me...so let it move you...close your mind, open your heart and ears..then listen...it's music..let it be music."
3,Very talented guitarist,"But they just need to lose the vocalist. And they did for the album due in Sept. 2000! This cd has a very cool GnR sound and feel to it. As we all know, Slash is a fantastic guitarist. Its the vocals that I have trouble with. He seems to struggle with any style of own. I cant help to think where this album could have gone had the band had a vocalist with more of a range. If you are a hardcore GnR fan you should add this to your collection. If not, hold out for the new one."
5,Ultimate Rock N' Roll Chaos!!!,"This album shows the better side of Slash and some of the ex-Guns N' Roses crew. I loved every second of it, especially songs like ""Back and Forth Again"" and ""Lower""."
2,"OK, listen here....","I want to give you an unblinded opinion of this album. Slash is of course one the greatest guitarists in recorded history but this solo album fails. It's not his playing though. It's the people he works with. Mainly songwriter/vocalist Eric Dover. He ruins the songs and makes them almost painful to listen to. He has absolutely no presense or style and many of the lyrics are bad as well. At times it even sounds like he's trying to sound like Axl --- and failing miserably.I hope and pray that Slash works with a new vocalist on his next album. We all know that a ton of worthy ones would be lining up to work with him!If you want a good Gn'R solo album, check out Izzy Stradlin and the Ju Ju Hounds. That guy has a voice, style, and he is the best songwriter to come out of Gn'R.Of course the best thing for Slash and Izzy would be for the real Gn'R to regroup but there seems to be little hope of that unfortunately."
3,a fairly good start for Slash's Snakepit,"I love Slash's guitar playing, he is my idol etc. Now then, this first offering from the Snakepit is so-so. First off, Slash's guitaring is jaw-dropping as you'd expect and most of the songs are fantastic. However, the main (huge) dissapointment of this disc is Eric Dover's singing. It does not fit in right with Slash at all, he just seems to squeal out the lyrics and after a few songs it really does get annoying.All in all, good but not great. I really do recomend Ain't Life Grand, Snakepit's second album. It is a masterpiece, a totally new Snakepit with a trully amazing singer! Buy that instead. Rock ain't dead!"
1,AWEFULL!,Someone said that this album would grow on me. I listened to it once and hated it. I gave it another chance and you know what? I hate it even more. It's terrible. Slash finally answers the musical question: How bad can a disc be? Here's your answer.
1,NO TALENT,"I guess if I didn't know anything about music or guitar playing I might like this. But seeing as how I'm not a complete ignoramous I know that Slash is a hack. His playing has no emotion, like Hendrix or Clapton, it's all machismo, and that is why he will be remembered as a bloated has-been."
3,Too many balls in the air,"A.B. Yehoshua has grand ambitions for The Liberated Bride, but he tries to do too much, and in the end he fails to satisfactorily bring the novel to a conclusion. As one of Israeli's most accomplished novelists, he no doubt felt he could pull off a novel of such grand ambitions (and he should have). But he needed to remove at least two or three characters. He should not have juggled so many issues and scenarios.In the end, the novel would have been less encyclopedia regarding the human condition and the Middle East, but would have packed a more powerful narrative punch."
3,Richly detailed tale of modern Israel,"Yehoshua's tale of a modern Israeli family and its exposure to Palestinians/Arabs provides a great plot and setting for exploring the political and social issues of the region on an individual scale. The translation seems a bit stilted, though, and the syntax is sometimes difficult to follow. Worth reading for anyone interested in the Middle East today and its social mores."
3,"Lengthy, confusing","I'm reading this because it was chosen by my book club. However, I would not recommend it. I felt like I was plodding through its 550+ pages.It does show some insight into the Israeli/Arab conflicts based on ancient value systems."
3,Needs a more realistic central plot device,"This novel contains many interesting vignettes, but doesn't work as anovel. I was truly touched by the parents' disappointment and concernover their son, but for this central device to be effective, the gapbetween them would have to based on a more natural dilemma than thebizarre secret chosen by Yehoshua. As an exploration of the problemsfaced by sensitive Jews and Arabs, it is a worthwhile read."
3,Contrived and lengthy,"While Yehoshua has proven himself to be an excellent writer in the past, his latest does not measure up to his standards. Not that it's a bad book: it's definitely readable and somewhat enjoyable. However, its basic premise - which is the engine that drives most of the story - feels very contrived, and the story itself is at times slow, not to say boring. The political aspect, as always a major facet of Yehoshua's work, feels tacked on to the story instead of being an essential part of it. And all in all, there is just too little story here to support such a long book.In summary - not bad, but I wouldn't make this my first Yehoshua."
3,"Unfortunate choice of ""non-standard film","In most reguards a great camera at a good price. But Sony sticking with it's proprietary, over priced and underperforming ""memory stick"" instead of the industry standard Compact Flash is VERY disappointing. This junk is slower, more expensive, comes in much smaller sizes, etc. It's also too bad they they do not use batteries you can use in a standard charger, or buy off the shelf. Meaning if you're on vacation and you find the perfect picture, you'd best have saved some of the juice in the propriatary batteries. Also a 5x zoom lens is not that impressive. Why not a 7x or better? Minolta's 5 megapixel Dimage 7 does. As do several others (some as high as 10x optical)"
5,Modaji - Pre-Sets,"Modaji rightfully became famous for a series of 12""s that helped define broken beat jazz as we know it, and PRE-SETS collects them together into one handy package. It's an embarrassment of riches, really. Right off the bat, ""Starburst Over Orion"" sends the listener on a blissful journey right into the stars, while ""Shortcuts in Mono"" will have you scrambling for your samba shoes. ""The Latin Protocol"" has a moody and mysterious bassline to ground the rolling percussion and long synth chords; ""20-32 Unlimited"" has the same vibe, but goes in a completely different direction. ""Outboard Jeopardy"" is a nice, long jam that shimmers and shines, especially at the break two-thirds of the way through. ""Locura Quieta"" lives up to its title (""quiet madness""), and the final track, ""Endzones,"" closes out the album on a slow and dreamy kick. If this is your first encounter with Modaji, it certainly won't be your last."
4,thoughts on a friends book,i enjoied reading this book....i noticed about the author that he is very descriptive but not too descriptive... When i read the book..i felt like i was watching a movie..i have faith in Estevan that he will achieve his goal as a rich famous successful writer...i reccommend this book to anyone and i hope that they enjoied the book as much as i did...Lizz
4,Servant of the Realm,"Servant of the Realm has a plot that keeps you coming back for more, and I found myself turning the pages to see what happens next. As Vega's first novel, it tells the story of the consequences we all have to face when we screw up in real life and how it affects everyone else around us. I thought it was a good read."
1,This book is awful,"I live in Ohio and I read the book thinking it would be a good read coming from a kid. But it is not, it really sucks and Estevan is not an author. Vega don't write any more books, they really do suck."
5,Welcome to Felicity's World 1774 . . . .,This book is excellent as a teaching tool. It describes life and all its surroundings in the year 1774. Very well written and photos are excellent. I used it for a 5th Grade class on a class trip to a 1690 homestead.
5,"""Look and Feel"" History for junior readers",This book appealed to my wife and granddaughter. They said it spoke to their point of view and by describing how everyday things were done that are still part of a girl's activities the book makes that time more vivid for them. Recommend the series.
4,Link to Product Specs!,"It looks like there is some confusion as to the actual specs for this model. Here is the link to Samsungs product data sheet for the LN-R409D. Looks like a nice unit!http://product.samsung.com/SamsungUSA/PRODUCT/20050719/LNR269D,329D,409D,469D.pdf"
1,What happened to 1899.00 Offer?,"A friend purchased or thought he purchased the Samsung LN-R 409D last week and Amazon sent him an email that the deal is off.Strange that Amazon and Target exorted people to: ""Get on line, first come first serve"" buy this item and then reneged on the deal.There's a name for that..........I hope all of you out there that had this happen write to both Amazon and Target and have them honor the sale at the 1899.00 quoted price."
1,shocking price change.,"Amazon offers this item for $1899.99, the customer orders the item in good faith, and then, lo and behold, Amazon decides to change the price to $3299.99 and simply says: We can do that. That's our policy. I am really upset that Amazon would do this to me especially since I have been a loyal customer for years and have placed dozens and dozens of orders. This is no way to treat a customer. You should honor your offer and take the loss and write it off to good will. That's what good companies do."
1,Terrible Experience with Amazon.com,"It happened to me too! After 4 days, I received a cancellation email from Amazon. And the worse thing is I already sold my 51"" Sony KP-51WS520 because I though this new TV would fix better in my small living room.I used to trust Amazon.com for their good name in business. I've bought lots of things from their website such as techs, books... and they provide good quality merchandise with free shipping!Amazon, please be true and honest to your customers. If you cannot honor your stated price, then don't advertise it on your website. Don't take away the trust from your valuable customers. Without them, you cannot survive.And for innocent customers like me, be aware when you see any good deal from Amazon. It may not look like it appears. So WATCH OUT!!! This is the most terrible experience I've got with this online vendor!1 star for the worse customer service."
3,any help here?,"is this a new item from Samsung?this model from Samsang normally has an ATSC tuner, but why does this product say it's an ""monitor""?very confused."
5,Great for greek 'frappe',"This is must for greek 'frappe' drinkers. Different than the regular instant Nescafe found in grocery stores. Add one heaping tspn of this instant coffee, two tspns. sugar, about two ounces water, and shake like a mad person in a shaker. Pour over tall glass of ice, add more water to the remnants in your shaker and pour the rest in your glass. You are now good to go. The greek version of this product is the only way to go for true Greek frappe."
3,Hard to stomach but it has its uses,"When I lived in Greece in the Seventies, I insisted on drinking what the old people drank, namely Turkish coffee (""emeis to leme elleniko"" - ""we call it Greek"" said a blurb on the package). However, Greek youth frequently spurned such stuff and drank instead the ""frappes"" made from the product you see here. To each their own. However, I've found a different use for it these latter days: I carry it on camping, and, especially, backpacking trips. Since it doesn't need, really, to be heated, there's no messing about with stoves and cleaning. How does it taste? Well, you can't have everything. But if you're addicted to coffee, and heat is unavailable or inconvenient, here's a product that might serve your purpose. Or perhaps prove that you're not the old-fashioned sort of Greek."
2,A Made Up Yawner,"This book is a bore with minimal facts and an author with a wild imagination. Tries to tie many outside events whether real or imaginary to the theme and because of this he has been able to add 200 maybe 300 plus pages of fantasy.Don't waste your time like I did and try to find something a lot better.Sorry, I don't like to belittle authors but this was one of the worse books I have read in many years."
2,No Low Back Support,"I read all of the great reviews about how comfortable this chair is but it doesn't work for me. The bungee cord idea is a good one but the final design has a problem. There is no low back support. When you try to scoot back deep into the chair you end up sitting on the frame. I guess if you don't need any low back support, this might be a comfortable chair. I use it for a coat rack."
3,Boo-Hoo is right,"Thanks for the honest reviews, the boo-hoo scene was great, this is a dense book. It is not long but each sentence moves you in a way. MOves you to tears, laughter, shock and passion."
4,"Different, but Good!",I thought this was a different type of writing. Interesting and very good! I liked it. I also read another book by this author called Come to me Sheba. It too was very good. He's deep! Good romance and very hot!
4,rome to the highest,i didn't know about this cd here so i purchased it anyway i really did like it except maybe 1 or 2 fast songs overall this is a nice cd.
5,5 stars!,"Actually 10* for ""Nestor's Saga"", absolutely fantastic-beautiful and haunting melody.I insert the CD in the CD player , pick this track and press ""Repeat"" on the player and let it go...Only Pink Floyd's ""Shine on you crazy diamond"" and Michel Jarre's ""Oxygene"" had the same effect on me at 1st audition.The other melodies on the CD I like them less but I recommend it for the 1st track.If you'll look carefully you'll discover that you can download it only if you buy the whole CD-Amazon know why..."
1,It's not Speak of the Devil,This is not the DVD version of Speak of the Devil. Speak of the Devil was an incredible live album of ALL BLACK SABBATH songs performed by this band. I can't believe I'm the first person to point this out.
2,live? ha ha,"this is totally bogus. ozzy's vocals are overdubed. they are not even close to being what he sounds like live. the music sounds great, but then ozzy comes in with studio created vocals. i wish they would give us the real raw product. i saw this tour, his voice was rough but it was live. in concert he can't get all the notes, but who cares, it's still great when he can't reach all the high stuff. it is done so badly sometimes he is singing one thing and you hear words that don't match with his lips. very disapointing. ozzy don't be ashamed of your voice we love it anyway. don't buy this for ozzy's live voice, it's a studio creation. i blame sharon"
4,This DVD Rocks,"The quality of the DVD is pretty good, the audio is not bad either, Ozzy sounds great, this is an excellant concert dvd.The editing out of the time in between songs is pretty disappointing, because i think seeing ozzy in concert is more than just the songs he sings, but the whole thing, talking to the audience and so forth, leaving those parts in would have made this much better. However it does rock! and it sounds great i would recommend this for any true ozzy fan."
5,Great DVD of a clasic OZZY period!,"Length:: 4:59 MinsSold many of these OZZY 1982 Speak of The Devil DVDs, look up my feedback graeme6262.Contact me at HeavyMetalDVDs@aol.com if you want a new DVD and case of this great concert!No spanish sub-Titles. Tne Best OZZY DVD of this period!!!!See the video sample!!"
3,Speak of the Devil,"I just purchased this video.This is NOT the Speak of the Devil album.Maybe the tour (1982), but the original album was recorded at The Ritz in New York.Just look at the song listing!I was very bummed. I have been waiting for the real concert since 5th grade.This is a great video, don't get me wrong, but claiming it is the Speak of the Devil show is incorrect and misleading!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Quality Disappointing,"I was at this concert, and it was awesome, one of Ozzy's best, so I was very excited when this came out on DVD, and I thought it would be re-mastered or cleaned up, but this DVD is no better than watching an old, worn out VHS tape. But still a must for die hard Ozzy fans."
2,Not really live (overdubs),"I have this release as a Brazilian import, and I assume this release contains the same material. The setlist is the same on both DVD's.My problem with this DVD is that Ozzy's vocals are studio-vocals which has been used to overdub the live vocals from the concert.Some of the guitar work is also overdubbed. Which makes this DVD worthless if you want to experience Ozzy Osbourne live in concert.If you're OK with this, then you will probably enjoy this DVD.But if you're looking for a true live experience, you'll be disappointed, like me.The audio and video quality is good."
3,Ozzy isn't singing. At best he's doubling and sometimes singing along with a backing track!,"I've been an Ozzy fan for years. Sure the material is awesome and the players are great (Brad Gillis did an awesome job filling in for the immortal Mr. Rhoads),but watch and listen closely. Ozzy isn't singing on this. At best there's a backing track and he's just sometimes singing along. The vocals sound doubled throughout every song! What gives? Is it post production? Is that how he performed back then? I've seen him recently and even though his voice doesn't hold up as well these days; at least he sings.I am curious of anyone's thoughts."
3,Good for die hards,"Saw this tour (Diary Of A Madman) just after Brad Gillis joined the band. Good performance from the band. Was one of the first big metal stage shows. My biggest complaint, aside from vocal overdubs, is that the lighting is not good at all. If you're a die hard Ozzy fan, then get it for nostalgia. Otherwise, just buy the Tribute album w/ Randy Rhoads. Same tour."
1,Omitted song.... why?,"Once upon a time I owned this great vinyl album, then I bought a cd player. One day I saw ""Speak of the Devil"" on CD so I bought it. I took it home and listened to it and was shocked to learn that they omitted ""Sweet Leaf"" from the disk. I guessed that they wussed out to the ""Say No"" crowd. Well, Wikipedia says they ran into CD time restrictions and decided to omit a song. I can't believe the song is omitted from the DVD. The song is totally awesome unless you are retarded. Get the CD with Sweet Leaf and you will be happier."
2,overhype,"Hey look, the songs are great but when I had the DVD, the sound or at least the 5.1 sucked. Only for serious collectors."
5,Happy this was finally released!,"Great concert from May 1982, just a couple months after Randy Rhoads untimely passing. Brad Gillis was the best guitarist to try & fill the shoes of the one & only Randy Rhoads R.I.P. Much thanks to Ozzy for finally releasing this gem!"
4,Love it!!!,"This Hello Kitty bag is very cute and strong so it hold all my things good, but I expected the bag to be bigger. Guess I should have looked at the measurements. I still like it though!!!!!!"
4,panasonic microwave nn-s744bf,easy order - fast shipping - item arrived in good condition - have had 3 months and no problems so far - just what i expected.
1,Pretty bad,There was some pretty bad acting in this one. The script was pretty bad. The make-up was pretty bad. This film was just pretty bad. Sigh. Whoever recommends this movie to you is not your friend. Avoid it.
4,most of the double concertos are here,"This is a nice collection of some hard to find works. Some of the works are available elsewhere, but others (like the Rossini Fantasy) are nowhere to be found.The playing is very good-clean, in tune, well phrased-not totally ""italian"", but still very very good. I own 2 of his CDs and would not hesitate to buy the others."
1,Dissapointing,I've been following this band for quite sometime. But this release is just not up to par with other music in this genre. The best way to describe Bab Tiles music is a dark carnival meeting space music. Sounds good but unfortunately this record doesn't deliver the goods. The production is really bad which makes this a very tough listen. Don't get me wrong I think this band has potential which they show on their previous Green Midnight Glow album BUT with Teknicolour Aftermath they went astray.
3,"""Big"" Mistake","This monitor has great colors and I liked it, but it's TOO BIG. I don't know how people can use such a large monitor. I pushed it all the way to the back of my computer table and it was still in my face. That's not a problem with the monitor, though, just my preference. I'm going to try a 17"". I didn't like the adjustment buttons. They were narrow and very sensitive, so it was difficult to adjust. If I didn't have long fingernails, I would have had to use a pen or screwdriver to make my selection. If your monitor wobbles, you didn't ""snap"" the base onto it, but make sure you want to keep it before you do. My daughter had to come over to help me remove the base."
5,fantastic smell,i have been using this perfume for years and get a ton of compliments on it. great price and ship cost
3,So so a bit disappointing,"Not as powerful as expected, but the fact that you can fold it really helps. Not the greatest but okay"
2,Good while it lasted,"Product worked well while it lasted, but less than a year out, it is dead. My wife and daughter have long hair and it would occasionally ""shut off"" due to heat. This last time, it never came back. This is the shortest time we have ever had a hair dryer last."
3,Too heavy,"A little disappointed. This hair dryer is heavier than I expected and seems to take a long time to dry my hair. Even with the diffuser, it blows my hair all over the place. Guess I should have bought a compact hair dryer but was caught up in the ""ion shine ceramic"" gimmick."
3,Not very powerful,It's definitely not as good as the last Conair 1875-Watt dryer I had for 4-5 years. The dryer doesn't feel as powerful and the high setting feels more like the low setting on my old dryer.
5,Awesome hair dryer,"I bought this hair dryer about 1 year ago, and I absolutely love it. I have very fine hair which tends to look like dry straw if I use a dryer without the ionic feature. I also have a problem, especially in the winter when the air is dry, of flyaway electric hair. Ever since I started using this conair dryer, my hair has stopped being electric, it takes less than 5 minutes to dry my hair, and the result is shiny, bouncy healthy looking hair. I also like the fact that the heat and the air flow are independently adjustable, so I can have it on full blast with medium heat for my hair, and then reduce the heat, but keep the airflow full when I do my kids hair. The handle folds, so it doesn't take up too much space, and it only weighs 20oz. It has ions, ceramic technology, turbo, 16 heat and flow settings - for a full sized dryer, I couldn't wish for anything more..."
5,Great Blowdryer,"This is a great blowdryer. I had one before and this one is a little different, but it works great. I love it! Compact and the handle folds up which my old one didn't do, which is a great feature for traveling. High speed - dries hair quickly! Very fast shipper too! Thanks! Love it!"
2,Not Up to Prior Conair Standards,"I've been using Conair hair-dryers for 20+ years. I stuck to this brand because they've always provided good merchandise that was a good value for the money. That long streak ended with this product.Pros:1. several different speed & heat settings provide a useful array of options2. fairly inexpensiveCons:1. there are two back filter screens; the outer one will not stay attached to the unit on the clip side, & the closing latch is defective; I removed it entirely because it doesn't seem to affect the operation of the unit considering that the second screen is built-in & usable2. the hottest setting is not very hot3. the slide controls are not aligned well (they slip past the detents & require too much force to push)4. overall cheap construction, even for this fairly low price.All of this results in a poorly made unit, & not at all worth the price. A big disappointment for a dedicated Conair user. Time for me to look for another brand."
5,PLANTIN SEEDZ..GROWIN TREEZ...GROWIN G'Z!!!!,Off tha Top its hot homeboy....YGD owns the disk....tracc 22 EXPLICIT: DEAD RINGER...WORTH THE SCRILL JUST 4 THAT THERE....C.
4,Suunto T3,Good quality product that came very quickly with standard delivery. A great heart rate monitor with a bunch of other good features.
5,Great shoes!! Salomon has hit the mark again!,I had an older pair of the Salomon Snow Clogs and I wanted a new pair. I could not find them anywhere and I went with a different brand. I should have just waited for the Salomon's. These clogs are so comfortable and perfect in the snow and ice. They are the perfect shoe for anyone that skis or snowboards as they are like slippers after a long day on the mountain.
5,Roberto Clemente ... A true legend,This documentary was well directed and accurately told. It gave my students a very comprehensive look at the man and the baseball player.
4,Research carefully first,"I used this waxless seal on 2 toilet bowls, one bowl new, another from the 1940's?, and draininginto lead closet bends the tops of which were about 1-1/2"" from the finished floor elevation. Theyworked great in both cases, although I could not use a standard floor flange, I had to use a floor flangeextension only( the flange without any tube), screwed down to the finished floor. I also needed to enlarge the center opening of the floor flange extension so that the seals on this product passed through it easily, and down into the lead closet bend. As I commented on J Martin's review, explicit diagrams or drawings made readily available by the manufacturer, of the exact dimensions of this product, would help someone planning to deploy it. 4 out of 5 stars because it worked for me."
4,Nice CD,"I forget how I first got on to Richy, but this CD is terrific. Not sure why no one seems to know about him save for Willie Royal (a fellow Sarasotan) of Willie & Lobo."
4,A true story of emigration in the 1830s,"The book is about the emigration of the Burlend family from rural England to the wilds of Illinois in the 1830s. It gives us a glimpse into the life of this family through the eyes of Rebecca Burlend...the decisions to be made, the sorrow of leaving home for the unknown, and the hardships they would face once they arrived in the new world. As a decendent of this courageous woman and her family, I am proud to recommend this book."
2,whoa!,"this toy came in little pieces that i had to put together with Japanese instructions, so of course every time my son picks it up it falls apart, not much fun."
1,horrible,this toy was in total pieces and had to be put together. the directions are hard to follow. would not recommend.
3,It works until the ending!,"It arrived in time, and in condition described, however when i watched it, the ending doesn't work! It just freezes & jumps around a little bit, but cant be watched, so that was a shame!"
5,Love this movie!,I love this movie! It is good clean family entertainment. I have a 6 year old granddaughter who loves it so much that she wanted me to buy it after she watched it on tv so she could see it again. Also she likes the girl scout adventures.
4,DVD,This movie was a blast from the past. It's a great movie and Shelly Long was funny and wanted to own it on DVD for I already have it on VHS.
5,Beverly Hills what a thrill!,This is a feel good movie! Great to enjoy with your family or friends! I was so excited to see this on sale for DVD! I snatched it up as soon as possible! Enjoy with popcorn and m&m's!
3,Fun for Kids,"I loved this movie when I was 14.A rich,glamorous Beverly Hills woman becomes the leader of a wilderness troop and decides to teach them to survive in the wild of Beverly Hills!!"
5,Oldie but goodie!,"One of the few movies Shelley Long made. Probably one of the first ""dumb blonde"" type movies. Ditsy, funny, quarky, joyful and ends with one ""feeling good"" !"
5,Troop Beverly Hills What a Thrill!,"Okay, basically I grew up with this movie! Everyone in our neighborhood did! My older sisters and I have always quoted different parts of this movie. How could you not? It is hilarious!! This shipped SO FAST! I got it the day after I ordered it.Fun film, good message, funny... its ""A blue light special!"""
5,WOW what an experience!,This movie is sooo touching and Funny. It has many aspects to it that makes the story a Classic. I love the way all the rich parents get together with their high-class sophisticated children. Get it! I wish i could watch it again for the first time! Oh it's very funny
5,Troop Beverly Hills is one of the greatest movies ever made.,My friends and I are sophomores in high school and everytime we are together we watch Troop Beverly Hills. At school we are always quoting from it. You can ask any of my friends and they would all say Troop Beverly Hills is one of their favorite movies. What can I say IT'S A CLASSIC!!!!!!!!
3,i love the 80's,"This movie was cheesy, yet funny and heart warming. Watch it with the kids, I think they will enjoy it."
5,FUNNY,This is one of the funniest movies! It has great values the kids will learn plus some adult humor. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a sense of humor! Enjoy!
4,Gift for the fiance,"I got this as a B-day gift for my fiance, she loved the movie when she was younger. It's cool that movies from the 80's are comming out now on DVD. Good quality, funny movie."
4,Great Start,"I love reading books by Susan Mallery. This one is a great start to the Royally Wed series. Alex and Mitch are wonderful characters who try very hard to fight their attraction for eachother. They are complete opposites. She's a princess, and he's a cowboy. You can't get any more different than that."
3,Not True To Color.,I got this hoping it would darken my pre bleached hair to a more golden tone. The color they show here in the picture is extremely off by the way. This color turned my hair brownish gold. Not a dark gold color(deep Gold)Now i have to bleach the crap out of my hair...again and try another color. The picture here shows it looking almost deep red to burgundy. That's not the color of it. I bought this in a store and it didn't look like that. The true color is not true at all during and after application. If you are looking for a deeper gold blondish color you will get brown with this. It shouldn't even be considered a blonde color at all. I am very disappointed and pissed that i have to subject my already damaged hair to another bleach application to get it out and start over again.
1,Awful!!,"I recently stripped my hair to get rid of all the colour in the hope of going lighter. My hair ended up a light brown/ginger colour so I thought I'd go for this dye, which promises a nice blonde outcome even with dark brown to black hair. Contrary to this, my hair is now DARK BROWN, so it will be even harder to go light or I may have to strip it again and wreck my hair!! Will be writing a strongly worded letter to garnier!!"
4,Tesla is great...,"This is a very good cd. Tesla are very underrated and have many great songs. Too many, in fact, to fit on one cd. ""Cummin' Atcha Live"", ""Hang Tough"", ""Call It What You Want"", ""Need Your Lovin"", ""We're No Good Together"", ""Lady Luck"", ""Stir It Up"", ""Freedom Slaves"", ""Shine Away"", and ""The Gate/Invited"" would've made a good second cd. Or you could just get all their albums, cus they're all solid. If you like rock n roll, Tesla is a band you need in your collection."
5,Rockin' Out,"I always loved this band, it's a shame they did not get as much press as all the ""pretty"" bands did. Their music always makes me smile, and this compilation has all my favorites!!!"
2,"Where is ""Call It What You Want""?","It never fails! You eagerly await a greatest hits CD only to find your favorite song was left off the damn thing! While this CD is packed with hits, the omission of ""Call It What You Want"" (a big hit, at least on my radio station-KEGL) just pisses me off. The cynic in me thinks that this song was purposefully left off so that people will continue to buy their biggest album, ""Psychotic Supper"". Bad, bad label."
3,Not even close,"Tesla is one of the most underrated bands of the era. It is a shame that they got lumped in with the rest of the bunch (Warrant, Poison, etc). Some of the glaring omissions are: EZ Come EZ Go, Cumin' Atcha Live, 2 Late 4 Love, Freedom Slaves and Call It What You Want and many more. This is decent collection of their songs but if you are a fan I would recommend buying the first 3 albums. It would serve them well to put out Greatest Hits volume 2."
4,GUAAAUUUU TESLA TESLA TESLA,"Bueno, ¿qué se puede decir de Tesla?, un grupo muy original, y debe decir, uno de mis favoritos. Lamentablememente, como todo lo bueno, duró poco. Tesla posee un estilo de música muy original, para gustos especiales, con mucho virtuosismo en las guitarras, melodias muy armoniosas. Para mal, a mi entender, este disco no recupera todo el poder de Tesla, faltan muchas canciones, faltan canciones que le dan el gusto al grupo... debió ser un album doble y en que además podamos disfrutar de las canciones inéditas (Rock the nation, Run run run, etc.) y de la canción que da el título a la película ""LAST ACTION HERO"". Sin embargo, siempre será bueno tener en nuestra pieza y en nuestros corazones lo mejor de un exelente grupo... y nunca olvidemos NO MACHINES!"
3,delivery,I had bought 2 watches from this same supplier at the same time and to be delivered to the same address but was charged delivery for both.. not impressed
2,Nice look from far away,"I was disappointed at this watch. I know it's cheap, but I didn't expect it to look so cheap. The mini dials inside are fake. If you take a look at some distance it looks nice."
5,To Conservative Catholics,"If you are a Conservative Catholic who has just witnessed another clown Mass, or had to put up with a ""homily"" from Sr. Snakebite, or if you are sick of seeing laypersons handling the True Presence with their grubby hands, here is my advise: buy this book, and try a traditional Roman Rite Mass (Tridentine). Try to go to an FSSP Mass, but you can go to an SPX also. Do some research on the web and you will see that you can attend an SPX Mass and fulfill your Sunday obligation - it is not a sin to attend. As for the bad review from the neo-Catholic, please consider this statement which the Church has decreed heretical: ""17. Good hope at least is to be entertained of the eternal salvation of all those who are not at all in the true Church of Christ. (Condemned in the Syllabus of Errors)"". Does JPII still condemn this? If not, then he is in error."
1,"More from the ""I'm my own authority"" crowd","If you're looking for a screed from radical traditionalists who (like Lefebvre) don't understand and/or accept the legitimacy of Magesterial authority and the authority of Vatican II -- well then look no further. If you're obedient to Rome -- yes, postconciliar Rome -- and don't think authority in the church is a personal plaything to be manufactured every time a small sect doesn't get it's way, then this book is definitely not for you. And at least one of the authors (see his Politically Incorrect Guide to American History) thinks Lincoln had it all wrong and slavery was just going to go away in short order because the South would see to it. Bad history and hubris all the way around."
2,Understanding the Traditionalist movement,"This book gives insight into what the whole traditionalist fuzz is about. Why do some people long for the restoration of the Latin mass? What has happened to the Church over the last 40 years? The answers while interesting are a bit one sided. Since this book comes from the far right of the Church, and wants to ""close the book"" on Vatican II, I cannot recommend it to orthodox Catholics who want to understand the teachings of the Church. But for spiritually mature Catholics who want to understand the fundamentalist mindset that lies at the foundation of the radical traditionalist movement, the book is invaluable."
5,A good read,"One might think that one of the Beatitudes was: ""Blessed are the spinmiesters"", for those who wish to justify the current state of the Church must make up endless excuses which have no correlation to the truth. Like political spin. Like ideology. This book punctures some of these rationalizations.The Church does not claim to be perfect regarding prudentially: and to defend the Church as though this was a teaching is not to honor God. Mistakes were made: avoidable mistakes. Unnecessary mistakes. The scandal comes to mind. And we are not put here to explain those mistakes away.The Church is a monarchy: and there is no fleeing from responsibility."
4,complicated but good,lots of bells and whistles. don't know why all manufacturers are allowed to advertise ridiculous numbers for range. my experience has been 1-2 miles with gmrs and this is no different. i like this radio.
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"17 Mile range?????? Hahahahahahahaah.These radios have an effective range of approx. 2 miles. Do not buy them, instead go with a cheaper Motorola model that will give you better range and performance. The batteries also are failing to hold a full charge."
1,2 Way Radio NOT up to 17 mile range,"We bought these units specifically to take on a cruise ship. There was not one minute on any of the many channels that we did not experience interference, pick up other 2-way users, or had no signal at all. We were so dissatisfied that we returned them to Amazon for refund."
1,Not very good radios,I don't like these radios becase they only go about 1/2 the mile. The battery doesn't hold full charge. I would recommend going with motorola model or midland that will give you better range.
5,Life-changing!,"This is one of the most valuable books in my library. I've given copies to many people, and all of them have reported that it has changed their lives."
4,Move Over Merton,"Let's say you're a Christian who seeks a closer relationship with God and want to explore contemplation. And let's say you want a nuts n' bolts guide book. You find Thomas Merton's obessesion with the pacifist left wing of Roman Catholisim irritating. And Wild Communion is both paganistic and hints at perversion. And Tom Brown Jr. trys too hard to be New Age and wannabe Native American. This is the book for you. Judy lays it on the line and gives you the ""how-to's"" as well as whetting your appetite for a more intimate relationship with your Creator. You'll find info here you'd have to glean from volumes of Merton's writing and you won't have the sneaking suspicion you're turning from God toward the Earth Goddess or polytheism. I highly recommend it."
1,No Way,Anyone who knows me would tell you I truly enjoy reading. I am an avid reader known to finish an interesting book within hours. It took me two weeks to get past the first seven chapters of this book. The story just could not keep my interest. I felt no real affinity to any of the characters. I have other books by this author and come away with an interst in what would happen next with her lead characters. She writes with real emphasis on how characters interact with each other and usually leaves you wanting more. In the case of this novel I just didn't feel it. Her other novels will not leave you dissapointed. Ugly ways is not a good example of the Ansa's true talent as a writer. If you have not done so try her other novels. I guarantee you will come away wanting to read more.
2,The dead one should have been the star of this book!,"Books that catch the hint and kick into high gear at the middle/end of the book seem to be stuck with me as the caretaker. This book was no exception. UGLY WAYS was a novel that had a good premise, but kept it going on a very slow pace, until the funeral parlor scene, when it really got hilarious! That was the best part of the book. Mudear should have been on the cover instead of her daughters, because she was the scene stealer. She may have many misunderstanding about her girls, but she still loved them, and when all is said and done, who could ask for anything more? I could. I could have asked for a better book, but at least Mudear saved the day. The ironic part is she had to be dead to do it!"
4,The name says it all!,"Doesn't the title remind you of somebody you know? This is a good book, very funny, and easy to read."
2,No symphathy,"I got caught up with the pain of the sisters, but that soon gave way after a few chapters. The characters acted like whining children throughout almost the entire story. This was not an interesting followup to Baby of the Family. However, I do recommend Ansa's other works for they are well written and enjoyable reads."
1,Where's the beef?,"20 pages which are really 18 pages which have about 6-7 pages of pictures doesn't leave much room for content. And - there isn't much. It's almost like a review of a real book touching on lots of interesting stuff, but no details. You can get everything and much more in several other books. This would be better described as a leaflet or overview. Complete waste of money."
5,One of my favorite stuffed animals!!,"This cat backpack is one of my favorite stuffed animals, and I have a lot. I got mine for eighteen dollars, and it was worth the money. My brother and I are very entertained by these sweeties; they're tons of fun in the car. They are fluffy, fat, and always make me smile. And as far as stuffed animals go, they're quite useful because you can use them to carry stuff around, but they may get dirty. Mine's name is Kaitlyn, and my brother's is Katryn. Their eyes are kind of strange because either they look sweet (the best one), angry, super angry, or crazy. But that's a very minor problem, and the pros beat the cons. I would recommend this backpack to anyone and everyone!!"
5,Return to Bright Size Life,"There will be many members of Metheny's fan club who are still struggling to digest 'Song X', the avant-garde album that he made with Ornette Coleman in the 1980s. The improvised content of 'Quartet' may not be as uncompromising as that, nor as grating as the industrial noise of the more recent 'Zero Tolerance ...'.Nevertheless, the group's performances here travel a long way from the saccharine jazz-rock that has brought Pat and his loyal keyboardsman Lyle Mays such a huge international following. Instead of the usual lush, overblown rhapsodies, Quartet reminds me of the stark, ambient textures of Pat's early work for ECM."
4,"All in All, an excellent album. But not a gem.","I like this album a lot. There's a lot of neat stuff and a lot of variety. Some of the tracks don't interest me much, but to make up for the disapointing tunes, there are some amazing pieces as well. The guitar solo on ""Take me there"" is mind-blowingly impressive as well as the track, ""Sometimes I see."" There are better albums of Pat's (Life Still Talking, Secret Story, Letter From Home, Imaginary Day, Travels, and a host of others) but once you have purchased the above mentioned albums, then I recommend ""Quartet."""
1,"Music for the soul?, body? mind? Yes, to fall asleep by","This has to be the worst album I have ever listen to. My six year playing the kazoo and my three year twins playing drums and toy piano make better music than this. I've stopped buying Pat Metheny albums after ""Travels"" because the quality of music has suffered. Granted, Pat is a great guitarist ( check out Bruce Hornsby's Hot House or Michael Brecker's Tales of the Hudson) but he is interpreting other people's material. I apologize but this music frustrates me."
5,dvd worth the price alone,"Some people write the longest stupidest reviews. What do you all work for Rolling Stone, Jeeez! Great cd. The dvd is worth the price alone."
5,Great Album,The mixes on this c.d. is totally awesome how Howie remixes these songs into totally different sounding tunes with the same lyrics. Some new songs are added and kick .... The DVD is unbelievable and this cd is definately worth the ... price!!
5,Fantastic,Our family loves Seinfeld and were glad to receive this volume forour collection. The transaction was perfect with no problems. Wouldrecommend this seller.
5,sharing all my experiences with amazon,Really enjoy this product as well as all I get from amazon will keep going back
5,Completes the set!,I have every volume of Seinfeld and love them all. This season is no exception. It has all of your favorite episodes that you love and grew up watching. Plus the price is unbeatable.
5,wanting to see frogger,I got this to see the episode of the frogger. It was funny and I really think everybody should see it. it's so funny.
4,The wheels are wobbling,"Well, the final season is here and although it's been a great ride so far, this is probably the weakest of the later years seasons. Don't get me wrong, it's still head and shoulders above the majority of TV comedy, but when you have such a rich pedigree as Seinfeld, it feels slightly disappointing. There are good episodes but there are also some poor ones where nary a titter was raised in my household.Still, if you've come this far, it's an essential purchase."
5,Funniest Show on Television,"For years, nothing could beat Seinfeld in funny. Then we get shows like Curb Your Enthusiasm or BBC's The Office. Seinfeld, however, stands apart as one of the greatest sitcom's ever created. It broke the mold and refused to follow the comedic forumula previously established by other lesser shows. Season 9 is one of my favorite seasons, the majority of it's episodes are on my favorite episode list. Far from declining after David's departure, it surpassed itself and my expectations in continually leaving me rolling on my living room floor each Thursday night."
4,Awesome product!,The DVD came in perfect condition like I would have bought it at a store! No scratches at all and played like a charm :) The delivery time was pretty good too.. thanks so much for the awesome service!! :D
2,Done...,"by the 9th and final season, pretty much all the magic was gone.it had become an obnoxious charicature of itself. the fact thatpeople give it five stars is highly suspect. and the final episodewas embarrassing...- cRAIG"
1,Antipiracy Publicity in every disc,"The rate is about the DVD Edition, not the show. Is one of my favorites shows of all time.A shame of edition.Contain in every disc, without the chance of fast-forward or interrupt, a long antipiracy comercial that starts before the first episode you select after inserting the disc.Very annoying. Probably I have watched the same commercial at least 15 times in the last weeks.Why I have to be forced to watch that commercial so many times when I bought an original edition?I bought the last two season recently and the same also occurs in the 8th season."
3,Not my favourite,This is the least enjoyable season. I thought it as unnecessary. An I thought the ending was overly contrived even if their comeuppance was long overdue. In an interview Jerry says that the show was still top rated. Many of us watch TV shows past their prime because of habit. Or we're curious to find out how it ends. Not because the show is still good and/or relevant. The British know not to overextend their welcome!
5,The best everlasts!,"The final season not only doesn't let the ball drop but also leaves you thirsty for more! Jerry Seinfeld and team wrap Tv's all-time best sitcom with 24 episodes filled with the most amazing comic absurdities. Hard to choose a favourite story: hilarious 'backwards' ""the betrayal"" episode; ""the voice""; ""the reverse peephole"";... Even the 'flashback' 2-part ""The Chronicle"" episode is so beautifully edited that you forget it's all about things you've already watched. The only shortcoming in this package was for me the too short ""Scenes from the roundtable"". The return of Larry deserved a longer exposure! Even so, this minor pitfall doesn't compromise the great value of the set. Definitely 2 thumbs up!"
5,Seinfeld Rules!,I wish i had bought the complete series at one time instead of individually.The complete box set looks cool.
5,Great DVD,How can a person go wrong with Seinfield??!! Quality is excellent and it was on time as usual.Roxann HillGecko Girl
4,Seinfeld Last Season,"The DVDs has a loooooooot of extras for EACH chapter, I've never saw something like this, a lot of extras... I didn't saw all of them, just a few and all the chapters. The Finale is not the best I'd imagine but it's very good anyway!"
5,Sad to see ya go!,"I own all the Seinfeld DVD's - Every Season - My only regret is there's not more.If you liked the show (and I loved it), you may have missed an episode here and there so now you can see them all and go back to the good old days of real funny TV. A show about nothing - Only a Genius like Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David could pull this off on network TV without a single cuss word. Classic material and a simply incredible cast make this a must see again and again and again.And if you've never seen this show you owe it to yourself to see it now.10 STARS"
2,Not what I expected,The video is simply a compilation of camcorder-quality home videos dating back to the 80s.
3,"Alvin ""Bass Binz"" McCoy","Two or three tracks may be on point. I was surprised to see on the art cover that Captain Quad disses DJ Magic Mike and DJ Fury with a cartoon comic. This CD has a lot of ""Lolly Pop"" rap with no good cuts on it as he disses the other two named. Only one LP from this artist, and disses the other two that has more LP's, figure it out."
1,Micro Cookbook,"I have not been able to install this program as it is not compatible with WindowsXP, which leaves me with about 1000 recipes on an external drive that I cannot access. I lost the original program when I bought a new computer.Also, the company (Pinpoint) is out of business so I cannot receive any technical help."
1,(not a target enthusiast) Don't waste your money,I bought this phone about 4 months ago and was initally pleased. The sound quality was great it felt good in the hand and on the shoulder. After a few weeks it would ocassionally not dial when I press numbers. Right now I can't get it to dial anything unless I keep pushing the numbers over and over. I've never dropped it so I know thats the problem. It is just a bad phone. Don't waste your money.
2,Just doesn't last.,I have owned this phone for about 6 months. It is now very difficult to get situated on the charger and the sound quality has deteriorated since purchase.
1,Bad reception! Good thing that it's no longer available!,"...I decided to get this no frills 2.4 GHz GE phone. This phone works fine inside the house. But when I stepped outside, during a phone conversation, I will get this constant clicking as it tries to keep the signal with the base. Even when I have set the base high, and away from any electronic equipment. I returned it! So don't bother with this one!"
2,Poor Quality,"I have had this phone for about one and a half years, and already am having the same problem as another reviewer where the phone will no longer answer, and just beeps, even though it's been recharging overnight. Additionally, the phone gets very static-y when I enter my attached garage, which is only 15 feet from the base. And finally, I am not a heavy user of my home phone (I more often use my cell phone), and am on the budget phone plan of less than 30 calls per month - so the problems I've been experiencing have certainly not been due to abuse."
4,Good Basic phone,"I've read some reviews that criticize this phone. Don't know what they did to it (dropped it too many times?). We recieved this phone as a holiday gift and have been pleasantly surprized. I typically have little faith in GE small appliances and electronics, but, since it was a gift, was forced to try it. No problems to report. Fair battery life, never a signal failure, locator works great, looks good on our office desk. Can't beat the price. If it's got what you want, buy it!"
2,A disappointing sequel,"I felt this was a big disappointment compared to the first one (Detonator). While the chemistry between Mike Graham (Pierce Brosnan) and Sabrina Carver (Alexandra Paul) is evident, the script was poorly written and I felt that this movie was just thrown in together. It was not a very suspenseful movie, and some of the acting is pretty atrocious, especially by the characters in Hong Kong. The first Detonator was very well-written, well-directed, and well-acted with great actors such as Patrick Stewart, Ted Levine, and Christopher Lee, but I could not believe that the same director was responsible for this sequel. I would definitely stick with the first Detonator."
2,D.O.A.,"Pierce Brosnan is back as a government soldier/agent, this time looking for whoever stole a famous Rembrandt painting and replaced it with a forgery. Working with a female agent played by Alexandra Paul they travel to Holland where they find the painting in the possession of a businessman. He has a deal with gangsters from Hong Kong that involves a computer chip that can be planted in any telephone and then controlled by a satellite he has invented and plans to launch into space.Detonator 2 is a little more light hearted in tone than the first one but its really no better of a movie. The plot is convoluted and dopey. The acting is somewhere between amateur and people hired from the local mall. William Devane hams it up during the action-packed but wholly unbelievable ending and then its over, leaving you feeling cheated out of quality entertainment."
4,Much research,"Much research went into the writing of this book and the conclusions drawn from that research are interesting. I much enjoyed the book and can see where it would be a good source for further research into the subject. The authors were also kind enough to include a large section regarding their source material. However, I can't exactly say that the writing was of a style that would keep one awake for long periods of time. If you are looking for just entertainment value, look elsewhere."
1,This book wasted my time.,I found this book from an online course for getting the A+ certification. As I studied it I found inaccuracies. Some of the practice tests even have wrong answers when aligned with actual study text. The book rambles on and on about history and theory but gives little information needed to pass the A+ exams. I enjoyed the computer facts but I spent my money to learn the technical aspects of computers and prepare for the A+ exams. This was a major waste of my time that I needed to spend on getting my A+ certification.
1,Frustrating and outdated,"It is truly hard to understand why this book is even still in print. It doesn't even have information on OSs dating back to XP, much less anything on current wireless technology. If you are looking for a boring book on the past or have a yen to work on antiquated PCs, then this is for you. If you are even remotely serious about learning current technology and doing sound diagnostic repair, then save your money and look elsewhere. Giving it just one star was being generous!"
2,Clear soap runs green,"We have several pieces from this set and love the look. However clear Softsoap comes out green. Makes one wonder about what chemical reaction is taking place! Whatever the cause, I don't want to put the stuff on my face."
1,Ditto Disappointed's review,"From the first, the soap dispensed was green, I assume from rust. Totally useless."
3,This fountain is beautiful but...,It is very pretty but I was expecting the mist to be more dramatic and have a humidifying effect which it really doesn't . It does look good though.
3,Beautiful mist. Unstable stand.,I had seen one of these mist lamps at a friends place and had wanted to get one for a long time. I ordered this one before the holiday season so I would be able to use it as a decoration as well as to boost up the humidity while the heater is running.I love the look of it. It looks awesome. My only complaint is that the base of the stand should have been a little wider to make it a bit more stable. It is too easy to tip over. Especially if you have a pet that might brush against it like we do.
4,it works,Everything works. Haven't tried the tablets since my Camelbak is still fairly new and clean.I find the two-piece plastic drying kit to be very useful and have no problem figuring it out even if there were no instructions. Both pieces have clamps that hook on to the tubing. The hook piece goes to the end of the tube where it connects to the bladder and is used to hang the bladder upside down. The other strange shaped piece goes inside the mouth of the bladder and keeps the bladder expended (otherwise the inner walls stick together when its wet).4 stars instead of 5 because $20 is a bit overpriced for these few simple pieces of items. You can probably using something else to get the job done a lot cheaper.
4,Greetings to Israel,"A very talented woman! I saw her live at the jazz festival in Montreux, and I was hypnotized. The percussion on this album is searching for equals..."
4,Excellent book although some tutorials not detailed enough!,"The first book in this series of three is packed with useful information and tips and is definitely a good addition to the ""out of the box"" manuals. Most of the tutorials are well written although I personally found that the NURBS section was not explained well enough from the outset. This was disappointing for me as NURBS was the technique I really wanted to grasp. However the small NURBS section in the second volume (Modelling and Materials - Boardman/Hubbell) wrapped it in a nutshell and as soon as I glanced at it I could see straight away how to model with them - I am now NURBing to my hearts content! Generally and excellent book but I recommend completing the three-book set!"
3,"informative, yet annoying",This book is simply a regurgitation of the manuals that came with 3dsmax. There are a couple of things on the cd that are helpful.
1,But Don't Look Here!,The female version of Bloodletters and Badmen but shoddier and more sensationalist. Nash's histrionic writing and lack of attention to historical accuracy again render his work avoidable to the serious researcher.
5,History - Come to Life!!,"Marsha Skrypuch is an excellent writer with the ability to draw a reader in and share an immensely personal story with courage and power. Her writing is simple but evocative, and she tackles serious subjects with great honesty and tenderness.Without meaning to, youth can learn immensely important historical facts while connecting with the past. These books are important reminders of events in history that must never be repeated."
2,Not worth it,"This is a good version of this song, but unless you pick this one up for $1 or less, it's not worth getting the single."
3,Super Reader,"Maureen Birnbaum, or, really, Muffy, sounds like your typical valley girl type. Clueless, in other words. The interesting thing is that she isn't, and this holds her in good stead in her satirical adventures to places like Barsoom, the Land That Time Forgot and times Lovecraftian.Robin Hood and company find out, for one, that she is no dummy. Fairly amusing."
5,This worked for me!,"I was suffering from irregular menstrual cycles for over a year and looked for something natural to fix the problem. After using this product for just a month, my cycles went back to normal. For as long as I took this supplement, my cycles stayed normal but after I stopped taking it, they went out of whack again. I know this works! I would recommend talking to your doctor if you have the same problem as me. Self treating isn't the wisest idea but I would still recommend this product."
5,Awesome,"It is with no hesitation my declaring this being Doyle Bramhall II's finest musical output.From start to finish,youwill not have an oportunity to press the pause button.I found JELLYCREAM also to be a heartwarming CD with touches of Neil Young in there. On ""II"" there are also touches of Led Zeppelin III (Check out ""Time"") and also Lennie Kravitz (On Close to me).Both those songs are totally Top Class.My two favourite tracks are ""Reason I live"" and ""Jealous Sky"". Theguitar pieces on the last track are absolutely chilling.No wonder you cant get this CD cheaply anywhere on the Internet."
2,Poor Quality,"I purchased this hose to drain the water from my humidifier. It has leaked from day 1 from the nozzle where it connects to the humidifier. If I get it in the right position, it doesn't leak. But I shouldn't have to mess with a brand new product to get it to work. I do like how thin the hose it, and how it's a darker green than most other hoses. But that doesn't mean much when it doesn't serve it's main purpose."
4,Needed new non-stick,My old saute pan had lost its non-stick properties and needed to be replaced so I ordered this. It was nice to have non-stick again but the info said nothing about the dishwasher so I don't know whether to put it in. I'm new to dishwashers so I don't what can go in and what can't.
4,"Sturdy, but mediocre paint finish","I bought the brown Fulton #1 size rural mailbox to replace an absolutely identical old one with a failing hinge. I chose this specific mailbox because I live in a neighborhood that is under architectural control, so I could replace my mailbox without asking for an architectural review.The new Fulton mailbox seems sturdy enough, but there are a few small spots where the paint is chipped or scratched. I cannot tell whether this is the fault of manufacturing or packaging, but since it was in the original Fulton packaging, in either case it is the responsibility of Fulton. This is not a serious issue, but it is enough to drop a star from the rating.That said, I am still happy with my purchase."
2,Make sure you have some way to inflate it!,"My problem is not necessarily with the item itself, but with the fact that it arrived uninflated! That possibility had not occurred to me, and although we have an air compressor, I had to go buy an inflation needle in order to blow it up! Meanwhile, during my Christmas shopping, I saw this football at several area stores, both inflated and cheaper than what I paid to buy it through Amazon (plus an exorbitant shipping rate, since it is not eligible for Super Saver shipping). This was a major lesson for me in terms of comparison shopping and what to buy or not buy through Amazon. Unless you are hours away from the nearest store that might sell this item, it is not worth purchasing through Amazon."
5,One of the most underrated ever,"Just as Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys was a major commercial failure yet is considered an essential, Pinkerton should be discussed in the same vein. This CD is different than the Blue Album, this CD is about one theme (a girl) while the Blue Album was just a crazy collection of classic songs. This is more of a garage album, a lot less production than on the Blue album, and MUCH less than that Green album crap (that's another review though). If you want to see Weezer at their creative pinnacle, give this CD a listen, it might take a couple of listens, but it'll be worth it."
3,"The album rocks, maybe too weirdly.","At first Weezer seemed to be a cute, quirky band whose staying power wasn't questioned. Now that they're gone, for the most part, what we have left is very little. I would recommend Pinkerton over their self-titled debut, only because they seem to rock out more. Their production is less polished, which is always endearing, though they still remain very weird. My favorite has to be ""Pink Triangles"" at the very least for its amazing sonic thrust."
5,Best album in recent memory...Bar none.,"Every artist has miserable moments in their lives, times when they are down, but the world doesn't usually care. River Cuomo was very, very miserable when he created Pinkerton. Thank you Rivers. You made an album that so many people can relate to. Usually an artist will have cheesy songs that are nothing beyond words, acting as if there is emotional output behind those words. Pinkerton is true to River's feeling. You can just feel it. And I can relate to so much that he sings about. I love Weezer, but this album was River Cuomo's own. Ten tracks of PURE emotion. Its wonderful. The only thing I frown upon is Rivers apologizing for it. Apologize for Green, not this. This is fantastic. Every track is fantastic. Rivers Cuomo is America's absolute best unstarstudded artist."
5,weezer's best piece of work,"this cd is much different than the other two self-titled albums which were a little more pop than rock. But Pinkerton, in my opinion, is one of the greatest rock albums ever made. Rivers is a very talented song writer and I like how he put alot of emotions and feelings in this cd. The way he sings in the songs is a very mournful and hurt type of singing, which I like very much. And the instruments sound very raw, especially the guitar riffs. This is probably their album that is most underappreciated because the style is different than that of the blue album. My personal favorites of this cd are ""Tired of Sex"" ""Why Bother"" ""Falling For You"" and ""Getchoo"". I highly recommend this cd to anybody, Weezer fan or not.=W="
4,Surprise: Pinkerton,"First off, by everything I heard, or haven't heard, about this album made me wonder if this album was going to be a disappointment. I was mislead. It's a great album. Sure, it's different from the happy-go-lucky songs from Blue and Green. It's more emotional and real, and sounds a lot different sounding. I can see why some people didn't like it, some people just don't like change.The guitar sounds rough, but that is cool. Lyrics are funny, and sometimes serious. My personal pick off this album is Pink Triangle. I love the guitar, and the harmony sounds great on the refrain. Of course, all the rest are just as fun to listen to.If you are a true Weezer fan, you should have bought this years ago. :) But, even some other rock genre fans might like the sound of this album. You should check it out."
5,great cd...but everyone has it all wrong...,"Rivers was writing this cd about his favorite opera, Madame Butterfly....so please stop saying that he must of been depressed when he wrote it, or wrote it after a bad breakup...or some other bs like that.one of my favorite cds of all time."
3,The follow-up album falls a little flat in my opinion...,"Before we start, let me say that Weezer is a favorite band of mine. Let me also say that I don't care for this album. I've played my copy of Weezer to death, and I still love every song on that CD. I don't feel that same sort of immortality with these songs. This album was good, but it doesn't compare to their first album. This album was just average, therefore it got an average rating. If you want a Weezer album, buy their first one. If you are a die-hard Weezer fan, buy this one, but don't expect it to knock your socks off."
3,The slide begins,"Alright... Weezer's first album was really good. They had a bunch of great songs, and the sound was new. This has a similar sound (not that new anymore) and a *few* good songs. The melodies and energy aren't as memorable. Of course, I could just be getting older, and less appreciative of this kind of music, but I don't find myself playing this disc all that much. When you play this disc in the background, only a few songs catch your attention. I'll probably burn some of the songs I do like onto a mix CD and put it back on the shelf.Dare I say ""one trick pony?"""
3,If only. . .,"It's too bad this album wasn't 11 seconds shorter, because then both Weezer albums actually could have fit on one cd."
3,Whine n' Cheez,"This album proves, if nothing else, that Weezer needs Ric Ocasek just as much as The Cars did. Without him in the production booth, ""Pinkerton"" (despite a few great tunes like ""The Good Life"" and ""Tired of Sex"") lacks focus -- and the endless can't-get-a-chick whining of Rivers Cuomo is tiresome, and more than a tad pathetic. If you don't belive me, listen to ""Across the Sea"", which is so bad it's actually embarrassing to sit through. I'm glad the band came to it's senses and hooked up with Ocasek again for their new album -- another ""Pinkerton"" would've proven fatal."
1,Sorry- never could dig it no matter how had I tried,"OK - first off, let me tell you that I consider myself a huge Weezer fan. Being a fan of the band essentially since day one (Blue album release prior to the Undone and Buddy Holly popularity), I have REALLY tried to get into this album. I bought it the day it came out with almost orgasmic expectations. The first time I listened to it, I was HUGELY disappointed. I listened to it again this week for probably the 150th time, and I was still hugely disappointed.I just can't understand what everyone allegedly sees in this album. My gut feeling is that people must feel that it is trendy to think this is Weezers best album, so everyone jumps on the bandwagon. Obviously, to each their own. I have THOROUGHLY enjoyed all of the other Weezer works, especially the B-sides you can dig up online. If you want to really hear some good tunes, search and find Weezers unreleased tracks - they really rock."
2,"One word: ""Disappointing""","I've got most of their other CDs. I held off on this one due to the bad reviews and they were right. I can't recommend this one at all. Muddy sound, lousy lyrics, no hooks, nothing."
1,WHAT HAPPENED???,"This is definately heading off to a used cd store. Weezer's debut cd is definately one of the best cds in my collection...now what the hell do they call this racket? These songs don't really have too much depth, the lyrics are bad, and the instrumentation sounds like a five year old who just picked up a guitar and went crazy with it. Do not buy this piece of trash."
5,Great album,this is weezer's best work in my opinion.i reallythink they've outdone themselvs with this one
5,Pinkerton: Sensational,"Pinkerton was a great album. Probably my favorite out of my collection. It was dark and at the same time uplifting. After this album, Rivers could never top this. The next time Weezer releases an album as good as this, will be if they come out with a b-sides album that I am hearing about. The Green album wasn't good, Maladroit was pretty good, and Make Believe was ok. None of them can come close to this and blue. My favorites from best to least:Across The SeaThe Good LifeButterflyTired of SexWhy Bother?Falling for YouEl ScorchoPink TriangleNo Other OneGetchooGo out and get this album!"
5,This album is so pathetic it's amazing,"Rivers Cuomo is a real big geek and he often got picked on and probably had his head doused in toilet water and feces. Girls shunned his frail exterior and even his parents and grandparents probably hated him cause he was such a mega-nerd. This album is where it all comes out. This is Rivers vent album. And because of that, it's an incredible incredible album. Just beautiful. Why Bother, Across the Sea, No other One, Pink Triangle, El Scorcho.....they're all friggin good! Every song. To bad Weezer will never make an album even close to this good."
5,Diffrent than the rest...,"What are you looking for? Perhaps your looking for just another CD you can put in and listen to, weed out the bad songs, and wear out the rest. I've been there, I've done that (haven't we all?). Maybe your looking for ""Weezer Two: Same Songs, New Cover Art"" (Makes sense, the first CD was amazing). If so though, you have a slight problem. Pinkerton is not only annoyingly addictive all throughout, but it's completely different when compared to the first album. You just might not like it the first time through, but I swear to you that it will quickly be fighting for scratches with all of your other favorite CDs."
3,better than todays weezer,"i honestly dont think this to be that good, it does have memorable tracks and is certainly better than maladroit and the horrid make beleive, but i favor the blue album over itl. the songs on the album just dont feel like they are 100%, it is certainly weezers most expiremental album. Getchoo and El scorcho are the best tracks, other ok ones are no other one and good life. the rest of the songs just arent that good, i've had this album awhile now and the other songs just dont grow on you. i would still recommend this to the average weezer fan and definatley listen to this instead of their newer stuff"
3,not up to Weezer standards,"Unfortunately, they left me a bit disappointed compared to their previous album. No ultra-catchy ""Buddy Holly""'s."
5,Not easy to write smart songs and sound so dumb,"I liked their first one, but wondered if they might be the next ""Dead-eye Dick"". But with Pinkerton, I have to say these guys seem to understand how to write a pop hook as well as any indie-type group that's come along. Or else, they just have the gift of song or something. But, in as much as they follow the tried-and-true 3 1/2 minute pop song formula, they seem oblivious to any ""rules"" when it comes to their lyrics. I don't know if that's bad or good, but either way, I'm hooked. Every night I have a different tune pounding away in my head as I try to get to sleep. I'd recommend putting this one on early in the morning. It should last all day. By the way, don't judge this one by the opening track. It's pretty foul compared to the rest of the disc."
5,Solid Album,"This album was solid from beginning to end. It's one that you can just put in your CD player, lay back and relax too. Nothing to heavy and annoying, not the bubble gum Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys stuff either. This is just some good music played by some good musicians. You can't pick a favorite song on this album because they are all just so good... every one of them and that's hard to come by in the age where groups do two good songs for a record and then add filler songs to finish the CD. I just want to know when the next CD is coming out."
5,Spiff-O-Matic,"This is one of the two CDs on earth that can make me sing them out of the car sunroof at the top of my lungs MONTHS AFTER GETTING THE CD. The other one is the blue album. Absolutely incredible. Across The Sea changed my life. Really, if you don't love it to start off with, you will. Much stronger and more meaningful than the first... they're both wonderful. It took me two months to take out of my CD player!"
5,A review by a Fan,"This is Weezer's best album, perhaps the best of the 90's. How can you resist the catchy choruses of ""the good life"", ""el scorcho"", and etc. A fine album.A fine diddly ine album."
5,Excellent!,I love the passion with which Rivers Cuomo sings (and I wish he hadn't lost it in Maladroit). The instrumentals are good and unique. The Good Life (Track Six) is great!-Lee
5,Pinkerton,"Ever write an essay, or a poem, and really let your emotions get into it. Something was bothering you, and you let it get the best of you. In response, people deal with this situation in many different ways. Some people can't deal with it, and fall into hopeless depression. Rivers Cuomo, writes songs. He got so into this record, he regret putting it out. He's embarrassed because it shows everything inside him, everything that shouldn't be known only unto his dear friends, he tells us. And it bugs him, and that's why this album is loved/hated. Intelligent, thoughtful, deep, and out of the ordinary. Don't expect to hear it on the radio, expect to relate to this album in more ways than you thought you would."
4,Excellent but not perfect,"""Pinkerton"" proves that there is more to Weezer than the nerdy image and lets the music speak for itself. All ten tracks are emotionally charged and well written, and the songs won't get out of your head for months. Rivers Cuomo, the man behind Weezer, shows musical maturity from the last album. He specializes in writing about relationships, in which he usually gets dumped, and this album speaks of nothing else. This is where ""Pinkerton's"" weakness lies, but the diversity of the music usually compensates for the lack of subject matter. Songs such as ""Why Bother?"" are heavily distorted and full of energy, but the last track ""Butterfly"" is a melancholy, soft acoustic song that serves as the perfect finale. Each song has something to offer, and ""Pinkerton"" is solid from start to finish. Even though Weezer did disown ""Pinkerton,"" it is still their best album to date."
3,Download this album first,"This is as close to emo as I will listen to. The lyrics are a lot more personal and melancholy than other weezer releases. However, this is not ""sad ..."" music, since it still kind of rocks. I heard that this record tanked, and that is sad, because it is good. Not for everyone, but if you are smart, you should check it out."
5,The stuff of legend . . .,"I must remember to keep my cool when seeing negative reviews of such a perfect album. People don't want bands to change or mature. Sometimes, yes, a band changes so much that they alienate their fans altogether in hope for better radio play and more money. That's bad. Sometimes, a band improves for the better. Of every band that has ever done that, this is by far the best improvement of all time. The music style cannot be identified by anything else but ""Pinkerton."" Nothing else sounds like this . . . anywhere. There's still a hint of the Blue Album in there, but as a whole, this album is an original masterpiece.And besides, how many bands can claim to have an album that both destroyed them and made them? It was because of Pinkerton that Weezer broke up. But it was because of Pinkerton that they kept a strong fan base, became legends in their own time, and were able to make a comeback. There are great albums out there, but few are this legendary."
5,~ Best Weezer ~,"Weezer's best album hands down. If you like the layers, the force of the riffs, the changing melodies, and the technical complexity of great rock albums, then this sick CD from Weezer you will need in your journey my friends. The fact that you are reading this review and do not already own it is vexing. .Best song on the albumAll"
5,THIS CD ROCKS!!!,"ok, for those people who only know Weezer as the ""Buddy Holly"" ""sweater song"" band, this CD is for you. it shows Weezer at their best. this CD is emotional, has awesome lyrics, and (in my opinion) the best guitar solos of any Weezer CD. the only way to make a perfect Weezer album would be to make a CD of Pinkerton mixed with The Blue Album. ARE YOU READING THIS RIVERS? PINKERTON+BLUE ALBUM= the best CD ever. for those of you debating whether or not to buy this, buy it. you wont regret it."
4,Another great dorky album by Weezer.,"It might be to one's interest to find out how Weezer can be so irritatingly great, but they've done it again. The first or second listening may not prove this, but by the fifth or sixth time, you'll find yourself singing the lyrics to ""el Scorcho"" and ""The Good Life"" at amazingly odd hours of the day and night."
5,Jesus Christ.....so brutally honesty and beautiful.,"Rivers Cuomo, the only rockstar to dislike groupies. This is a great album. I was going to buy it really soon, but guess what, I found it in a parking lot, in perfect condition. Shazam!!! What makes this even sweeter, is that it is great. Spectacular. Extraordinary. Don't be discouraged by the first 2 or 3 songs, even though they're great. This album starts to be great at ""Across The Sea"", which is about Rivers Cuomo's obsession with a Japanese fan that wrote him a letter. ""The Good Life"", ""El Scorcho"", ""Pink Triangle"", ""Falling For You"", ""Butterfly"". Jesus, this is great. Give it a couple listens. This album really grows on you. Rivers Cuomo is genius.WARNING: Do Not Expect What You Heard on Blue Album. This is completely different, yet better. Happy listening!!!"
3,good follow up album,"weezer came back after the great debut album of 94 a couple years later with ""pinkerton"",which is a good album,but definetly not better.stand out songs on this record are-""pink triangle"",""el scorcho"",""tired of sex""and ""the good life"""
1,D-oh!,"I can only imagine the conversations that went on before this album was recorded. (""Hey, man...how hard can producing an album be? Ric, Schmic. Let's just do it ourselves! All we need is someone's empty basement, a few cases of beer, a couple amps, a mic and a Radio Shack tape recorder!"")I love Weezer and I really, really tried to get into this album, but I can't. I still can't erase the horrible memory of first listening to it. (Sort of like the way I felt when I first heard The Strokes, but that's another story...)Pinkerton is AWFUL.Anyone expecting this to be anything like the other three albums is going to be sorely disappointed.If your life isn't going to be complete unless you have the whole Weezer catalog, go ahead. Don't say that you weren't warned..."
1,What were they thinking?,"Oh, please! I am a Weezer loyal fan, however, I got disappointed after listening to Pinkerton, since its quality is too low for what they are really able to make, I'm sure, and that's the reason of why they didn't get much money with it. The truth is that I dislike the sound of the guitars in this album. An example of what I mean is the instrumental beginning of Getchoo and No other one. Besides, the songs in general are displeasing. Why bother? really BOTHERS with its simplicity, Across the sea is such a big garbage, and I consider some other tracks as the worst made by this band. On the other hand, my favourites are The Good Life and Butterfly, which is the last one and results to be a tune so beautiful and surprising because that's not the type of any Weezer song. So, if you like the band, I wouldn't recommend you to buy this one, but the Blue Album and the Green one. They do show their highness."
1,Worst Album ever Recorded!,Sorry to upset all you Weezer fanatics but I guess I just don't get the joke and musically I'm completely inept. I truly wonder what all these five stars are about considering this album is nearly as bad as Scott Wieland's solo L.P. It appears Ric Ocaseks production and dire help was needed the second time around. Maybe if Rivers tried to write a song not involving one power chord we could get somewhere. Utter garbage and waste of jing. Have a nice day geeks.
1,Jon W. for President!,"Jon W. is right, this album is terrible. If you want good songs, buy their first one."
5,Best Album of the 90s?,Pinkerton is hands down one of the ten best albums of the 1990s. It could be the best straight up rock album of the decade.
5,excellent,"This album might not be for everyone; it's not as goofy or cheerful as their debut. However, 'Pinkerton' is terrific. The songs are very catchy, but also bitter or bittersweet as well. After all, the album is about loves lost and loves never meant to be. That kind of subject matter might not be your cup of tea, but if it is, you will love this album."
5,weezer does it again,"all i can say is i am amazed.Coming off their awesome self-title debut....i didnt think they could even match their debut.They did one better.They topped their debut.Give this album 3 spins,and you'll be hooked.Every song is special in its own way and you will not be dissapointed."
1,Poor Quality Product,"The supplier was fine, the product was flimsy and fragile. It broke within one month of my purchase. The weak spot on this product was the spring clip mechanism that held credit cards in place."
2,Don't Buy,"I bought this item 3 years ago and the paint is flaking off and metal is rusting. It looks good for a while, but consider having to replace it every 3 or 4 years. It also rather small, doesn't hold much mail."
5,Perhaps the Single Greatest Guitar Chord Book of All-Time!,"I am new to the world of guitar, but Don Latarski's Chord Orbit book is amazing! It is organized according to chord tone and contains chord patterns that can be played up and down the fretboard. Rather than memorize dozens of different fingerings for dozens of different chords, Chord Orbits makes chord fingerings simple and repeatable. This book is remarkable!"
2,Technical exercise vs. musical composition,"Firstly, Aaron Rosand is rivaled by a mere few regarding virtuosity. Having said that, this disc is simply an expressive compilation of technical showmanship rather than musical enlightenment. Glissando! For the sake of all that is pure and Holy. Cat fights have no place in the repertoire of any violinist! Excessive vibrato, rubato and other ""tricks of the trade"" pervade this disc like locusts descending on the crops of the Heartland. Mr. Rosand knows (and has demonstrated through numerous recordings) the sweetness and emotional content of the instrument better than most. Only he will ever know why he recorded the disturbing content of the disc."
2,to many puppets!,"This was a dissapointment because it was tagged ""no puppets"" and every other episode was puppets!The kids always want to fast forward over them because they don't like them (I find them very annoying).This makes watching the dvd (especially in the car) a real pain in the neck."
4,Very Scholarly review,"I have just finished rerading Dr Cone's ""God of the Oppresseed"" It is a very good book because he parallels the Exodus from Egypt to Israel, the land of milk and honey; with the Exodus of Black Americans from slavery. He understands that ""The least of these"" relates to Black of Americans.Dr Cone reviews the signifiance of the black church and spirituals with the survivals of blacks.He very astututely points out the errors when white theologians do not consider Black Americans when they speeak of the oppressed.Dr. Cone shows the real meaning of the crucifixtion and resurrection and how it relats to blacks.Darrell Pone,MDOld Westbury, NY"
4,Exercise for cuttig,I found that after watching Learning to Surf with Surfer Joe 3 and following the exercises that my upper body and legs became quite a bit stronger and I had more endurance. Great disc. I recommend it highly for beginners and experienced surfers. I also found theother Surfer Joe disc very good as well.
3,Not as well written and seemingly plaguerized?,I have looked extensively through this book at the library but then ended up purchasing Rick Warren's Bible Study methods from my local Christian bookstore. WOW was I ever surprised at the amount of information and even some of the same QUOTES in both books. I was curious as to who wrote what first and it looks like Rick Warren was the winner! So is Terry Whalin guilty of borrowing quite a few thoughts? You can decide that or simply get the Bible Study Methods by Rick Warren. It's an easy read and packed with helpful teaching info.
2,Not very good...,I could only get to chapter five here. I always hate doing this to my own brethren but this book is poorly written.
5,I just have one question.,"It is absymal to me that VH1 produced, in my recollection, at least five (5) productions of DIVAS!live and did not strive to inlcude MS. Holliday in any of the performances. Absolutely inexcusable. You call a show 'Divas' and you DON'T include Jennifer Holliday. Check this list out and try to understand.....The Showstopper Diva - Jennifer HollidayThe Dance Diva - Martha WashThe Gospel Diva - Karen Clark SheardThe Soul Diva - Aretha FranklinThe Pop Diva - Mariah CareyThe Jazz Diva - Rachelle FerrellThe Country Diva - Dolly PartonThe R&B; Diva - Patti La BelleThe Background Singer Diva - hmmmm, toss up between Lisa Fischer & Melonie DanielsThe up-and-coming Diva Wannabe with potential - BeyonceThe American Idol Diva - Jennifer HudsonSome have been included, most have not...c'mon VH1 get on the ball. Keep on keeping on Jennifer your time will come again!!!"
4,Jennifer's Review,The album was indeed what i expected of her. I know she is a talented artist and is capable of tearing down the roof. There were songs on the album I did not know she sang. I am indeed pleased with my purchase.
3,Don't buy Dreamgirls to hear her best...,"Ok...I know that I am a skinny, little, white boy on the outside...but on the inside, I feel like this woman's voice is inside me. Granted, that may sound a little strange...i need therapy, I know...but this woman just opens her mouth and makes the damnedest sound! I just can't get over the fact that she is not the most revered singer of her class.""And I Am Telling You (I'm Not Going)"" is amazing. Her voice soars to vocal heights that are unmatched in any other singer's range.She is telling you that she is NOT going and damn...I wouldn't try to stop her!From the skinny, little, white boy to the Diva Supreme...you go, girl!"
5,Amazing Collection...All of the songs I would have picked!!!,"I had the honor of seeing Jennifer in my first broadway show which was Dreamgirls. I was blown away and have been an obsessed fan ever since. I own everything that she has ever recorded. If I were going to make a compilation of all of my favorite songs, this would be it. There are more that I would add but that would make this collection a box set.If you have missed any of the albums during the time that they were available, you can make up for it here.Jennifer has sung me through many dark times and I am eternally grateful to her.Robert DeAngelisAuthor/Oblivious Sensitive"
4,Striking voice,"The album is fantastic. This woman's voice reaches into my soul. I first heard her on the Tony Awards show and I will NEVER forget that evening. As she sang ""And I Tell You I Am Not Going"" my hairs stood on end. When she finished, I sat there in my living room, stunned, as was the audience. I can't even begin to describe the emotion I felt. Since then I have been a fan. I don't understand why Jennifer hasn't the fame that she definitely deserves. She is as good as or better than many singers who do have commercial success. Well, I am glad that I discovered her a long time ago."
5,Ellington at his best,I bought the LP many years ago and now updating with the CD. An absolute must for Ellington devotees.
2,wrong color,"I ordered ""pacific/titanium"", but received ""pacific/black"" which i don't even see an option for. Blue and black are UGLY together. Other than it being an ugly chunk of material, it's comfortable. I haven't tried running in it yet, I'm hesitant to wear this thing in public."
3,Okay hair dryer,The reason I say this hair dryer is just ok and gave it 3 stars is because I've had 2 of them. The first one only worked for a week and then I had to return it. It would only blow out luke warm air at half the speed it should. The second one works great. I do love how shiny the dryer makes my hair. It is worth the money if you get one that works. My hair looks great!
1,No better than the $25 Conair,"I purchased this hairdryer from Amazon.com in September, 2009. I tried it out and frankly, it does not do a single thing that my cheapo Conair doesn't do. It dries hair. That's all. It doesn't make your hair look any more special than any other hair dryer does. It (sadly) has no magic powers. It just dries hair. End of story. All I can think of is The Emperor's New Clothes. I feel stupid for having fallen for this nonsense. If you feel like you are doing something better for your hair because you spent this kind of money, then by all means, go for it. But, please keep this in mind; I have nothing to gain or lose by writing or not writing this review."
2,"It's Just OK, not all that!",The on off switch gets in the way of holding the handle and it often turns off while I am using it.
1,impossible,"Good morning, I regret to inform you that this article was mistakenly delivered to another person and never received it. This is why I can not deliver an opinion on the matter ...I imagine that the hair dryer is very good, so try to buy it but never came to my hands ...Isaías Aguilar"
1,not happy,"i ordered the T3Bespoke Labs hair dryer in 2010- within one year dryer stopped working- contacted discount jungle and was told to email dryer back for replacement- had to call several times and was told my dryer would be mailed out shortly or was on the way- one call was answered with ""it is no longer under warrenty"" - broken dryer mailed back to me with no explanation- i am not happy with this company and would not order from them again- i am now finding out they are an unauthorized dealer for the hairdryer"
3,Is it really 2000 watts?,"I thought I was buying a 2000 watt dryer, per the product review on Amazon. But printed on the dryer itself is ""1600"" watts. It works fine, but doesn't seem to have as much power as my old dryer, which was 1875. When I wrote to the seller, asking about the discrepancy between the product review and what's printed on the dryer, they said:This dryer is 2000watts. The 1600 that shows on the hair dryer is the power consumption. It is not the watts on the hair dryer. oNce again this hair dryer is 2000watts.Thank youOmni SolutionsBaloney?"
1,HAIRDRYER BLEW OUT,"I bought the T3 in Oct 2007 as soon as I received it I knew something was wrong. I have used a real one and this is not a real one, I don't understand how everyone loves their hair dryer and only a few people thinks that their dryer is a fake? Anyway over the weekend my dryer totally blew out I only had it for 6 months, now I have to try to get my money back which should be fun. It would have been so worth the extra 100.00 to buy a real one instead of paying 200.00 for a $20.00 refurbished Conair motor."
2,T3,"I have a month with the dryer now. My brother in law, a professional hair stylist recommended I purchased the Evolution 2000. I had high expectations, in specific, faster drying time. I have not had a faster drying time. Many times the dryer auto turns off and cools down making my drying time longer."
1,Only Purchase from Authorized Retailer - Not Amazon!!!,"I did not purchase my dryer from Amazon - however after 2years it just stopped working. Thank goodness I purchased from authorized retailer - I had no issues with the warranty process & received a replacement dryer from T3 (although it did take a couple weeks). This is a great dryer, I am very happy with it's performance & the warranty process - I rated low to warn Amazon shoppers to make sure when you purchase this item the serial # tag is afixed to the cord - it is absolutely necessary for a warranty situation. I purchase tons of things on Amazon - I was disappointed to hear of the others having issues since Amazon is not an Authorized T3 retailer. Make sure you do your research on this one before you decide where to purchase. I would definitely recommend the product itself."
5,T3 83888,"Outstanding product. I bought this for my girlfriend who has very long and beautiful blonde hair. Normally it takes her about 45 min to an hour to thoroughly dry her hair. With this it takes 15-20 min. In addition, her ai ends up softer then ever. Highly recommended."
1,DISCOUNT JUNGLE HAS WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I bought this blow dryer from Amazon which sells it through Discount Jungle and as soon as I received it, it would not turn on. I contacted the vendor and I was told that if I wanted to return it, I would be charged a restocking fee. I am appalled that this company would sell a non-working product and then charge its customers to return them. Will definitely never purchase from them again."
1,It's true - This Dryer Is a Dud,"I purchased my hairdryer through Amazon and within 9 months it flat out stopped working -- conveniently on the day that I was going to be a bridesmaid in a wedding. It wouldn't turn on, just went dead. Don't waste your money on this one, it will let you down when you need it most."
1,"Cheap Knock-off, Don't buy!",The reason the price is so low is that this is a cheap knock off and not a real Bespoke labs blow dryer. Mine stopped working after 9 mths and there is no warranty. You get what you pay for I guess.
1,dont buy this,"I bought this product because I though it was a great price. I shouldn't have bought it, it came with no serial number which meant no warranty. It does not work like the real T3 at all because it is not. Waste of money. I cant believe amazon is selling this."
2,Too slow,This product was recommended to me by a friend who always has good hair. I bought it and I am dissappointed with as its so slow. I thought since I was paying so much it would be quicker & better. I don't personally like it that much. You need to have a lot of time and patience - and for that you can probably get good hair with any priced dryer.
4,best hair dryer ever,"The hair dryer came quickly with no issues. So far, my wife really enjoy the system. since she's been using the hair dryer, she really notice less split ends."
2,weak dryer,"I bought this dryer, but when I recieved it and try it was not as powerful as i thought it would be . Then when I wanted to returne it they said they will be 15% restucking fee which sounds really sucks. If I did not open to try it how do I know that is work for me or not.I would never ever buy anything frome discount jungle."
5,Quiet and Light,"I purchased this hairdrier after reading the reviews from Consumer Reports - rated in the top 2. I tried to find locally, but couldn't find any from this manufacturer...but was tired of NOISY, HEAVY hairdriers! This one works great, has multiple temperature settings and is quiet and light - with an extra long cord to boot. It is also very attractively styled. No regrets."
4,Good dryer,This is a really good hair dryer. It is quiet and light. I'm not entirely sure it was worth the money but I still like it!
1,Amazon should be ashamed for ripping off their customers,"I too bought this dryer and in less than 3 months the dryer was not working. When I contacted T3 they informed me that Amazon was not authorised to sell this product but they would make an exception and for a total cost of $50.00 they would replace my very expensive dryer.Amazon should let you know of the issues before you by any product that will not honor it's warranty. I have used Amazon but never knew of this dirty little secret. I thought this was a customer service kind of company ,well it is not."
1,Not authentic,"I purchased this hairdryer after reading all the reviews that Amazon wasn't an authorized retailer for the T3 hairdryer, but I wasn't too concerned since it was such a good price. Needless to say when I received the hairdryer I don't even think it is a real T3 hairdryer. There is no serial number on the box and no serial number on the hairdryer. I went to Sephora and purchased another one with serial number on the box and a silver tape with serial number looped around the cord of the hairdryer. The amazon dryer was VERY loud compared to the one that I purchased at Sephora. The amazon dryer also blew a lot more air than the one purchased from Sephora. This really makes me question the integrity of Amazon's practices. I have been eyeing a new DSLR camera that just dropped below $1,000 on Amazon and am wondering if it will be the real deal or a knock off too?"
2,Dissappointed that Amazon was an unathorized dealer,"Very disappointed in the below, however since my hair dryer blew out I kept the item even through I knew it was not real thing, below is a response from the company:Amazon.com is NOT an authorized dealer. We suggest you return it for a refund immediately and refute the charge with your credit card company.Please purchase from an authorized dealer. For a list of authorized dealers please consult http://www.t3micro.com/. If the product is not purchased from an authorized dealer, T3 Micro cannot and will not guarantee that the product is authentic or warrant the product against defects, inadequate build quality and/or improper performance.Due to the popularity of our products, unauthorized dealers have sold and continue to sell, products which they contend are authentic T3 Micro Products.

4,T3 Bespoke evolution Tourmaline Hair Dryer,"It works very good,easy to use . I like it.Pros: no complainCons : Expensives"
3,Quite but *hot* and limited,"I appreciated very much the quietness of the hair dryer; at first I didn't believe it could possibly dry my hair in a reasonable amount of time. I have a very old hair dryer now, a conair, that I love, and honestly, I would rather use the conair.My dislike of the product:1.) It has only two settings, both very hot. The temperature is very very hot and hurts my scalp (I can't imagine it is good for my hair). My hair ends up less manageable and more frizzy.2.) The cool button must be held down; personally, I don't know why most hair dryers don't come with a button that keeps the cold air going, but I am not an engineer.Basically, if you don't mind very hot hair dryers, go for it, but if my must older and less advanced conair does a better job than this, I have difficulty justifying the expense.I hope this was helpful."
3,T3 Bespoke Labs 83888-SE Special Edition EvolutionProfessional Iionic Ceramic Tourmaline Hair Dryer,I was not too happy with this hair dryer. It's a nice hair dryer but doesn't blow very hard and it takes me longer to do my hair. I have a Hana professional hair dryer that is ten times the hair dryer this one is. I would say it's a fairly good deal for the price. I gave $200 for my Hana professional and it is still my favorite hair dryer.I'm mainly using the T3 Bespoke hair dryer for a back up.
1,buyer beware...,"The T3 was sold as new. At best it is a refurb., definitely used. The box on the outside specifically says to look for the serial number tag. There is no serial number so no warrantee. The packaging on the inside looks like it has been dragged through a parking lot. This is going back."
5,Love this hair dryer!,I've had two of these hairdryers. The first lasted a good eight years and finally wore out with daily use. It's extremely light and I would buy another!
2,Dryer on fire,"I really enjoyed this dryer for the 13 months I had it. It was quiet and dried my hair faster with less frizz. Unfortunately, sparks started flying out of it last week and some small flames appeared. So out in the trash it went. I cannot submit a warranty claim because I did not register it right away. Since I work and have 3 kids, that was not a priority so I am out $100 and back to a drugstore dryer that will last longer...."
1,"WARRANTY DOESN""T APPLY",Beware buying this product through AMAZON.com The 4 year warranty doesn't apply. I've had mine for less than 2 years and this morning it BURNED my hair because the blower isn't working properly. Had I purchased it elsewhere I would have the warranty available to me.
1,1 yr expiration for a very expensive dryer,"While this hairdryer worked, it was great. But unfortunately, in just under a year, it fizzed out on me this weekend. The hot air went from hot to warm and by Saturday, sparks flew and the only setting is cold. I have a lot of hair. I don't think it is a compliment to this hyped up product when my working hairdryer is the one I bought for $40 and is still running after years of use."
5,Love it!,"I had short hair my whole life until I decided to grow it out a few years ago. Since then I just thought that drying your hair took ages and was a nightmare. Then I got a job with a 2-hour commute and my free time become a lot scarcer and more valuable and eventually I determined to do something about the two hours I had to spend in the bathroom every Sunday evening... and after a little research I bought this hair dryer.After all those years of inherited, used and just plain cheap ""pharmacy grade"" hair dryers, my eyes were opened. Quite honestly I haven't a clue whether this rates as a good hair dryer amongst quality hair-dryers, but I have slightly wavy blonde hair past my shoulders and this thing dries it beautifully, quickly, smoothly - and leaves you in total control.And it hasn't broken yet. So, I love it, and I would buy another. Well worth the money. I can't even remember how much it was."
2,Didn't last 2 years,"I purchased this hairdryer for my wife in Christmas of 2009 for around $125. The dryer no longer heats up and the warranty was only good for a year. I will not purchase this product again. The price was too high for a hair dryer that lasted less than 2 years. I am trying my luck with Iso brand due to lifetime warranty. When the hairdryer did work, my wife loved it. That is why I gave a 2 rating rather 1. Maybe being I a guy I don't understand, but when I spend more than a $100 on a product, I expect it to last more than 2 years."
4,So much better than my old dryer!,It arrived quick and worked as stated. It's much quieter than my old dryer and cuts drying time in half. This item cost $200 in a store and I got it for around $65...very happy.
1,No warranty,I would not purchase this item again from Amazon. This dryer stopped working within 6 months of purchase which is very unfortunate given how much it costs.
5,Awesome,"I absolutely LOVE this hairdryer. My hair is healthier, shinier and I feel like I'm done in no time!"
5,Love this hair dryer!,"This hair dryer is incredible. I'm about to purchase a second one for my mother. I don't know how I got along without it! It dries my hair so quickly, and it makes styling with a round brush much, much easier."
1,Your buying a mark off ~ it's fake!,I bought this dryer because Amazon was the only place it wasn't out of stock. When I rec'd it in the mail it looked nothing like the picture. I went on Bespoke Labs to sign up for the warranty & they said it was being sold through an unauthorized dealer. I spent the $300 for it. I shipped it back hoping they will credit my account. If I'm buying something that xpensive it better be the real thing. This dryer wasn't. I could tell because Bespoke's name was only found on the box...not the dryer at all. Highly disappointed that I fell for a fake! I know how to wait until the product become available at an authorized dealer. Bespoke Labs warranty on this dryer is 4 yrs. if you go on their site. Amazon's is only 60 days. Don't waste your $ or time. It's like buying a knock off Louis in New York City. Don't do it!
1,Frequent errors make it difficult to use,"I needed an intro to Perl, which also let me jump into examples. From the table-of-contents, this book seemed like it would be a good one. However, I found the first chapter so full of errors (especially in the code examples) that it was almost worthless for a Perl newbie like myself.With Perl especially, it is difficult to know for certain whether a stray symbol in the code samples is a mistake or a subtle construct of Perl. This book's examples are cluttered with such odd mistakes, which really are generally mistakes.Even worse, there is really inadequate discussion surrounding the code examples to tell exactly why they are presented. Sometimes new constructs actually are introduced in the examples, without explanation surrounding them (or even reference to the later sections where they will be fully explained... which would be fine too).Very difficult for a beginner, and probably too simple for an expert."
2,Too proprietary,"As you go through the book, more and more examples rely on the previously discussed code. That makes it unusable as a reference book.My main complaint is that well over 1/3 of the book is devoted to HTML parsing and dynamic output, which is great. The problem is that the author wants you to use his HTML parsing engine for every 'How-to' recipe. So, if you don't want to use this particular parsing method, close to half of the book is useless. :("
5,Great book premise/very helpful,"I just bought this book today after much Perl book researching. This book is well organized/layed out and every example shows how to accomplish a real world task. Normally I go for the O'Reilly books, but this book illustrates how to do so much (dynamic HTML, sockets, forking processes, etc.) in one volume. I do wish that the book did touch more on SQL database access modules. Very happy I found this book."
5,Simple comment,"I knew Peter growing up and was very saddened to hear about his senseless murder.He was a wonderful smart person, I'm sure is very missed."
3,BLACK METAL MAILBOX W/KEY,"I PURCHASED THIS LOW COST MAILBOX FOR A RENTAL PROPERTY. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR WITH THIS ITEM. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A STANDARD, NO FRILLS BOX, WITH A KEY, THAT LOOKS ATTRACTIVE (BUT NOT VERY WELL MADE) THIS IS THE MAILBOX FOR YOU. I AM GRATEFUL THAT AMAZON COVERS BOTH EXPENSIVE AND LOW COST ITEMS."
3,Good iron but not at all durable,"I purchased the Solia in March 2006 after an extensive research of the reviews on Folica.com. I thought that the Solia iron was good, it heated up super fast, maintained consistent heat, never snagged and produced fairly smooth results (varies with the hair products used as well as the build up in the hair), however, by no means did I consider it as top of the line. After 2 years the red ""on"" indicator light began to flicker on and off when the iron was shifted during use... a sure indication that it was approaching its end, and 3 weeks later I smelled the acrid scent of burning components and my Solia was history. I guess nothing lasts forever so I overall did get my $85 worth out of it. This time I'm splurging a bit more and buying a FHI Runaway which is what my stylist uses and it ALWAYS produces such beautiful results....soft, silky and shiny hair for many days."
4,Good flat iron.,"It works great on straightening my hair, but the thing is, you'll have to use it with some kind of heat protectant, or it will really damage or burn your hair. I use it with the Sedu Smoothing Spray thingy. It works great with this. Other than that, my hair stays straight for the rest of the day until I shower. Really good. Large surface allows me to iron my hair out quicker.Love this product. I have it 4 stars because it will burn your hair unless you use a heat protectant. but it isn't that much work. Much cheaper than the Sedu Flat iron."
3,Not worth the money,"After researching the top 10 hair straighteners, I decided on this one and to be honest, I don't think it's worth the money. It's a nice iron but it didn't straigten my hair any better than my $20 Conair straightener did."
3,"Gregorian Chants: Hymns, Introits, Communions, Graduals, Offertories, Choir of the Vienna Hofburgkapeele","The vocal rendition of these chants seems to lack the power and thevibrancy of Chants I have heard by other recordings. The sound isa rather flat. I would have expected the recording to have been donein more a more ""lively"" Cathedral setting."
1,The video cover I puchased was not the video cover I received,I ordered this video and received a different version because the cover was completely different. It was not the product that I expected to receive
1,This copy not recommended,"I bought a new and unused copy of this book, and 30 pages of the script were missing. It is simply unexceptable."
5,a recent amy brown fan,"these fairys are beautiful with all the detail and just how they look. this one is one of my favorites. you should think about getting atleast one. if not for yourself, then get it for someone else. it is nice because you can put it anywhere! hang it from the ceiling, displat it, set it in a flower pot, or anywhere else you can think of!"
5,clear and concise advice from a very successful woman!,"It was a quick-read and I was able to absorb her advice very easily. Mary Kay is a wonderful inspiration to all women! I highly recommend this book, especially if you are a new Mary Kay beauty consultant."
3,anonymous,"Mary Kay Ash is truly an inspiration to all women. Not only does she succeed she lets you know that there will be obstacles to overcome, but you can and will succeed if you keep your priorities in order GOD,Family, and career and work hard. Nothing comes in life easy and through perservence and a dream and goal setting there is nothing you can't do. I LOVED IT!!!"
4,"Good, classic story film","I enjoyed this movie and, since I have never read the book, I probably enjoyed it the more for not having done so. It actually makes me want to read this book. The acting was good and the story held my attention but it was rather melancholy at the end, I thought. For the price of the movie I don't feel ripped off. It was a good buy and I am sure I will view it again in the future.If you like BBC Classic Dramas as much as I do, you will probably like it. If you are not into the genre, then this is probably not the best one to introduce you to the genre."
5,My Favorite BBC Production,"All of the elements that make the best productions by the BBC so great are abundantly present in this 2002 adaptation of George Eliot's DANIEL DERONDA. In the title role Hugh Dancy is perfectly cast, as are the other actors in their respective roles (including Romola Garai, Jodhi May, Hugh Bonneville, Alan Corduner, Greta Scacchi, Barbara Hershey, Edward Fox, Daniel Evans, and the inimitable David Bamber). This is not merely a costume drama; it is a drama of substance dressed in beautiful 1870's costumes and enriched by great direction (by Tom Hooper, who recently directed THE KING'S SPEECH) and music (why, oh why is there no soundtrack available?). Of all the many BBC productions I have seen, this DANIEL DERONDA is my favorite."
5,pleasantly surprised,I just stayed up untill 03:00 am to finish the DVD and was pleasantly surprised at the open mindessness of the story obviously originating in George Eliot. It is so refreshing to see an open mind in the Victorian era!
5,Fans of the book rejoice,"I read Daniel Deronda recently and decided to watch the film to acquaint myself with some of the fuzzier details. I was impressed by the BBC version of George Eliot's book from the word go. Well casted and beautifully filmed this is a lush story of Daniel Deronda, Gwendolen Harleth, and all of the other players in George Eliot's novel of subtle prejudice and self discovery.I found that the film did in fact crystalize all of the details from the book that I had somehow missed, and for me this was one of those rare cases where I found myself enjoying the film much greater than I had the book. The pacing is different and one or two events are rearranged to heighten the story telling, but I do not believe this hinders the original story. I found myself completely taken in by this superb adaptation and I believe that any of Eliot's admirers, or any period movie fan for that matter, would revel in this wonderful retelling of a classic."
3,It's OK,"This movie starts out with an interesting premise, but loses interest in the second half. Gwendolyn Harleth, the ""wicked"" woman is the only character of interest. Daniel is too wishy-washy and Mirah isn't given enough screen time to make anything of herself. Hugh Bonneville plays the villain really well. The ending is a little dark.Basically, it will hook you, then bore you. At least Romola Garai has outstanding costumes."
4,Daniel Deronda,"Once my wife and I started watching this DVD, we couldn't shut it off. We just had to know how things came out. Gwendolyn, a thoroughly spoiled young woman throws herself and her integrity away on a brutal man rather than become a governess. Deronda, who has intervened in her behalf once before, is unable to help now. However, he is more successful in saving a young Jewess from drowning herself and helping her find career and missing family. Meanwhile, he is unsettled in his own interests, for a secret hangs over his own past.My greatest regret with Deronda was when he absolved Gwendolyn of her murderous hesitation. The author was unable to provide her characters with any means of finding grace except by doing good works to compensate for past sins."
3,Very Disappointing,"While I have many of BBC miniseries this one is the only one not worth the money I paid for it. Just as the story really gets going & characters really take form it is over! Leaving you hanging as to what happened next. The acting is ok, costumes great as always in a BBC series but lacking in story. Very disapointed."
3,Eh.... ok I guess...but I've seen better...,"I love period movies and was excited to see this movie but in all honesty, it didnt grab my attention...It was long... and infinitely forgettable...Its all Jane Austens fault... She's ruined me for other english movies..."
2,"Slow pace, rather unacceptable ending.","I don't see that much attraction between Daniel and Mirah, so Daniel's sudden ""enlightenment"" as a Jew made him realize he loved Mirah who is a Jewess in the movie is quite unexpected. Rather disappointing with his choice, not b'cos she is a jewess, maybe I didn't see enough sparks between them.The other thing, being brought as a English gentleman, but still have some Jewish calling inside him is a little bit inexplicable. In the book Next of Kin said a chimpazee brought up by human consider themselves human. So, I don't buy that part.The movie is rather slow, but I would have enjoyed it better if not b'cos of the far-fetched ending."
2,Disappointment..,"Most of the characters in this movie are great, the scenes, the costumes and everything but I didn't like the outcome of the story .. I felt Daniel changed somewhat after discovering his past and I couldn't understand his abandonment of his former love in order to persue a life with that new girl. To be honest I never liked Gwendolyn's character at all, she was selfish, self centered and annoying, yet towards the end I felt very sorry for her, after all she'd gone through for Daniel and he seemed to have just forgotten all that which happened between them.It's just what you expect once you discover the jewish factor involved."
5,"Beautiful adaptation, beautiful DVD","If you can buy this, do it. Not only is the main cast stunning, but all of the secondary and tertiary characters are 100% ""in"" their roles. There are no sleepwalkers in this film. Everything is letter-perfect, from dialogue to score, costuming, acting, lighting and editing -- and anything else I've neglected to mention, for that matter.Also worth noting is the tecehnical quality of the DVD. I've gotten used to frankly rotten digital movies, mostly from the execrable A&E.; After seeing the bell-clear mastering of this DVD, I'm convinced that A&E;'s best option would be to pay the technical team at the Beeb to come over and show them how it should be done. The sound quality is crystal-clear, with lovely depth and immediacy, and the video quality is utterly perfect even at the highest resolution. No grain, no jitter, no nothing. The full warmth and depth of the color palette comes through in every single shot. Definitely worth both your time and money."
3,Daniel Deronda,This movie wasn't quite as good as I thought it would be. I probably wouldn't order it again if I had known it.
2,Not so hot,"Beautiful costumes and landscape but the actors didn't seem committed to the story line or were, in my opinion, not doing their best work for whatever reason. Nothing set this film aside from the usual British period piece. I was disappointed."
2,Not worth the time it takes to get through it,"Okay, I am glad that so many people enjoyed this film, but having never read the book, I had a very hard time getting through it. Let me start off by saying that I love period dramas, but this film was terrible. I didn't like ANY of the characters, and the supposed lovers of the film barely speak to each other. No one in this film is happy, and for the most part, they don't deserve to be. There is lots of whining and complaining about why life has to be so difficult and unfair, but I just want them to get over it!There is a large part of the film devoted to discovery of true identities, but that still feels wholly unresolved by the end, because knowing who one's parents are doesn't mean they'll know who they are themselves. It doesn't change anything for the better.Now I will say the costumes are beautiful and there are some amazing landscape shots, but I cannot under any circumstance recommend this movie to anyone."
5,Wonderful portrayal of George Eliot's novel,"I finished reading Daniel Deronda last weekend, so I would be prepared to compare it to Masterpiece Theatre's movie version. I love the book, despite it being about 80% prose and 724 pages long! The movie is very accurate to the book, the characters perfectly cast, the scenery, costumes and music giving it the lush feel of a Merchant-Ivory film. What mostly catches one's attention are the lines, being taken straight out of the novel, making it such a wonderful portrayal of George Eliot's last novel. My only regret is that I wish it were longer, both the book and the movie, because you want to know more about these intriguing characters and the lives they live after the story! Another fantastic job by BBC! Now...if only they would put Felix Holt out in movie version! Enjoy!"
4,Daniel Deronda,"Slow starter, but really got interesting as the show went on. The story had a good ending, loaned to one of my daughters, she said it was ok, but didn't seem to be one of her favorites. We love the classics, especially Jane Austen and the Bronte sisters."
4,Very good if only for the brilliance of the production,"An early Romola Garai vehicle, ""Daniel Deronda"" is faithful to the novel while yet putting its own stamp on the story. The cast is stellar and impressive, and Garai fans get their money's worth. This is a gem for period-costume advocates, one which effectively takes the viewer back in time. The pace is slow but deliberate and never boring - George Eliot, we think, would have approved."
3,Good Until the End,"I would recomend this movie to anyone who enjoys period pieces, the plot is interesting and fresh and the characters are complex and intersting. Above all the costumes were my favorite part, I loved seeing Gwendelyn's wardrobe with it's bright colors and lovely gowns. While I think the movie is good it could have been better, I felt that the end was rushed, Gwen's redemption and growth seeming incomplete and the Zionist plot never really got developed fully. Still the movie is watchable."
5,An undiscovered classic,"What a superb film! An amazing recreation of a favorite Asterix story. Characters and action are brought to life with excellent special effects translating cartoon reality into a 3D world. If your french is pretty good, then go to Amazon.fr and search for ""Mission Cleopatre edition prestige"" and make sure you get the 2 DVD set: this will give you a most remarkable second disc with interviews, but above all a full length documentary on the making of this film. And you'll find that Amazon.fr have all your details at hand and that ordering is as easy as from Amazon.com. I have watched this documentary twice now with great enjoyment and have gained immense admiration for the military precision necessary to make a film of this complexity. The reason I recommend the French 2-DVD set for french speakers is because of the lack of english subtitles, although my wife still enjoyed the documentary since most of the content is visual and obvious."
5,Great French Movie,"Make sure you have a dvd player that plays region 2 DVDs because this movie is a must see! (Your PC will probably play this movie, if no dvd player) Slapstick comedy, fun storyline, good pretty much for all ages, and it has Monica Bellucci."
3,Soundtrack revisited,"The soundtrack did not have the same punch that I remembered from seeing the movie in the theater or numerous times on home video. However, for me, the opening song by Issac Hayes and the next by the Red Hot Chile Peppers were worth the price. There is often a difference between the way a song is used in a movie and the way it is released on the soundtrack, and this one is no exception. Instead of dividing the releases between the orchestral soundtrack and the song soundtrack, I really would like to see a single release with all of the music from a movie. Often times rather than rewatch a movie, I will listen to the soundtrack which gives me a great experience without having to rewatch a film for the hundredth time. I often enjoy getting the soundtrack of a movie more than the dvd. I have more movie soundtracks in my collection than any other type of music. Beavis and Butthead still rule and I want to see them back on the big screen."
3,'Beavis&Butthead Do America'-Original Motion Picture Sdtrk,"Huh-huh,you said 'bone'.....huh-huh, you said 'do it'. I always thought the movie and the TV series was much better than this here soundtrack. I mean, it's alright. I just don't listen to this CD all that often. The better cuts include Rancid's ""I Wanna Riot"", White Zombie's ""Suicide Tanks"", Southern Culture On The Skid's ""White Trash"" and an old AC/DC goodie, ""Gone Shootin'"". That pity ballad Engelbert Humperdink's ""Lesbian Seagull"" is a joke. Anyone who sings that song OUGHT to be shot. Huh,huh.....you dill hole,huh-huh.....you monkey spanked!"
4,Purchased for one song,"This was the only way I could get a copy of RHCP ""Love Rollercoaster."" It was worth the purchase. I don't listen to the other songs."
4,Awesome Cd,"Great Cd , Amazon shipped my merchandise in excellent condition unlike other merchindise ive received have been damaged but that's no problem, The songs are great except Ozzy Osbournes song of Walk On Water, if you are looking for the demo version this cd does not have it, I don't buy cds that much anymore because i use Itunes to get my songs, Other people are saying that most of the songs on this cd are stupid, But i don't care i ignore all those bad reviews, i bought it so i can have some beavis and butthead music in my ipod, Great Cd for when you're with your friend or somebody that likes Beavis and Butthead."
5,Great Second Remote,I bought this remote as a second to the factory original I already had. It supports a lot of name brand models and is very easy to program. It is well worth the price!
2,I should have looked closer!!,"It's my own fault, but I did not realize this remote did not have number buttons. It works all right, but I like to change channels with number buttons too, as it's much faster. Stupid of me not to have looked closer before I bought it!"
2,Bland and unsophisticated,"Peter Cashwell seems a bright and pleasant fellow, and I'm delighted that he has taken up birding. But the essays in this volume, charming as a sentence or thought can be here and there, do not sustain the interest of a reader interested in either birding or good writing. Cashwell's ornithology is shaky, and there are just too many places (the maudlin Christmas Eve story, or the unnecessarily protracted account of his library work on the name 'cardinal') that his tone flags into the mundane.For real thoughtfulness, turn to Levine's Lifebirds, a title that has never got the press it deserves--and one of my favorite birding books of all time."
4,Colorful calendar,We got this because we wanted to make our daughter aware of weeks and months as she was well adept to telling time and days of the week. This is a great educational tool.
5,My kids love it!,Great product. Very good quality. I do wish it had some blank magnets we could fill in ourselves that fit more to our activities. A great learning tool for the kids. Would recommend.
3,small pieces,"The magnatic pieces are very small. Would be better if larger. Young children can handle larger pieces so much easier and safer. These pieces are way too small. Will probably get lost very easily. Wished I would have made a poster board-laminated or clear contact paper, with dry erase pens-would have been more hands on and imaginative for child.Other wise concept if very good and educational."
2,Chore Boards,"When they first arrived I was very excited to put these up in our 7 year olds room. He loves them and they do look cool, however the magnets are not that great they fall off all the time."
5,melissa and doug calendar is awesome,This magnetic calendar is really neat! My students love when I use it and they like pointing at the current date.
5,Lisa,This is a very well-built toy. I actually can't believe how good the quality is for the price. Most stuff you buy nowadays is crap. Santa purchased this for my pre-schooler for Christmas and it was his favorite gift. I will purchase this again for neices and nephews.
1,Way too complicated,"I fell in love with this at the store, but as with many kid's toys, what we like as adults doesn't always translate into a good toy. This thing has soooo many pieces, you'll spend half your life picking them up off the floor. The magnets aren't strong enough to hold, so it pieces fall off all the time, or hardly even hold onto the calendar to be of much use. I just think the product is a pain. It hangs on my wall and the pieces are all in a ziplock next to other complicated toys that didn't work out. Really, a plain or themed wall calendar is much better."
5,"Helps Learn Seasons, Days and Weeks","I have to admit that I love wooden toys for my kids, they seem so much nicer than all the plastic items today. While this isn't a toy, it has that same wooden charm.In kindergarten, every morning my son had ""calendar"" first thing in the morning. They would learn what day today was, what that meant yesterday was and what would be tomorrow. I got their wooden calendar to help him and my younger son understand those concepts. It's hard to remember back that far but the concept of what tomorrow means is hard for a young child to understand. The calendar has helped explain those concepts. We've even went into the seasons and how the sun determines what season it is for us.The calendar itself is magnetic and has a place for the year, month, and days and all sorts of special events. It has come in handy to show the kids how long they have to wait until certain days and holidays.I think I love this one as much as the kids do."
1,Hung the calendar and the string broke and all of the magnets fell off the board..,"Cheaply put together, kids were so excited hung it, and string broke.. magnets are not strong enough to stay on the calendar in a upright position.. save your moneyMelissa and Doug usually so much better"
4,Fun Calendar for younger kids,"We bought this calendar for our kids to play around with and it is great. It has magnets for nearly every conceivable event so your imagination is the limit. The only con was that after a couple of days out of the package, the bottom board began to warp (not a lot but enough to be noticeable) so now it sticks out from the wall and just looks a little cheap. Outside of that, it is a great toy and I would recommend it."
3,Good but faulty,"I do like the idea of this calendar but feel that the over all use could be improved on. For some reason the numbers don't want to stick if the wall it is hanging on is tapped. I've already lost several of the number. This could be fixed by having the numbers fit into a slightly hollowed out spot. Also it will only be good for a few years. Yes I can write on the numbers but it would be handy not to have to. I also think it might have been nice to have a pocket to put the numbers and pieces into when not being used. I know I like to write on the board so storing them there just isn't going to work. In general, it does suit its purpose and I do like it. I'm not certain how well this will work for my autistic daughter but I hope she will come to understand time better."
3,Helps autistic children,"I did buy this product to help my autistic son learn more complex routines and reduce his anxiety. It's work and it's funny. The paper cover of magnetics came out a little. But I'll buy plastic to cover it, because my son is enjoying himself and learning."
4,Great for introducing multiple concepts,"This is the perfect calendar for introducing your child to the concept of days, weeks and months. I ordered this calendar because my nephew enjoyed the exact same one a few years back. There are so many topics to introduce to your child: Numbers, dates, months, seasons, activities, and more. We've used the magnetic numbers to count and to get our child accustomed to her weekly routine. My only issue with this product is that you have to hang it somewhere sturdy and out of the way. One knock into the board and the pieces go flying."
4,Great Idea... with a couple of areas for improvement,"I agree with the other reviewers that this is a great, functional, educational toy. I also agree that it would have been nice to have had a few different tiles, and the lower magnet 'storage' slate is somewhat impractical. A little cloth bag, or a magnetized back to the calendar would have been more helpful.My main criticism is that the magnets are not very strong. It's easy for the pieces to be knocked off.Overall, however, it's a great idea, and kudos to Melissa & Doug for coming up with such a fun toy!"
2,Must have more complete info before ordering...,"While this may be a very thorough source for the words it covers, it should be noted in the basic information that this is ONLY 128 pages of a 15,000 page work. The description above is very misleading."
1,only a snippet,This volume is only a handful of the roughly 15000 pages in the complete Middle English Dictionary (MED). The title indicates that this is the second section of the complete W words list in the MED. Very authoritative.
4,Great Movie,I had seen this movie on BET a couple of times but wanted to see it straight without the censorship. But it is even better on DVD. I love it.
1,Movie,"I received the movie within a week, but when i got it the movie was cracked. I tried contacting the seller but never heard from them.. When i tried to play the movie it played the first 3 chapters and than froze up. I ended up having to order one from walmart because i couldnt get ahold of anyone to return the movie."
5,Snoop Dog: Boss 'N' Up,I loved this DVD. To the best of my knowledge its Snoop's first directed movied and I loved it!
4,Best Player movie in a while,"When I looked at the trailer for this movie, I knew I had to see it. I'm a big fan of Pimp movies. And this one not only expores the game, but it also incorporates something that we can all appreciate- love. This movie is very entertaining as well as dramatic and it covers a lot of realistic views of the game. All the characters took their parts seriously and made this an appreciative production. If you like ""game"", you'll love this movie!"
1,WARNING: SCARY FOR KIDS- not to mention terrible writing!,"Honestly, i expected shallow- i mean- it's BRATZ- my expectations were really low, but the entire disc is just really scary ghost stories that derive from urban legends and it makes amusement parks and clowns even scarier than they already are.There is no feeling of safety here.There is no happy ending.it isn't just silly fun.There wasn't even a redeeming message, just stuff to give kids nightmares-please don't waste your money on this.there is no Passion for Fashion on this disc."
5,Good for girls,"My daughter loves Bratz and has most of these DVDs. She has watched this one many times, which is probably a good indicator that it is a half decent production!"
1,Too Scary,"I got this for a sleep under my daughter was having, thought it would be perfect. Wrong, wrong, wrong... very scary, mature themes. Stay Away!"
3,Bratz: Kidz Sleep-over adventure,I had heard it was 'pretty scarey' but my daughter didn't have any problems with it. She liked it and is a big Bratz fan.
1,Too scary...,This movie is entirely too scary for children. The images and themes are too mature for young audiences. Parents that don't want to put crazy ideas in to their childrens heads should not purchase this video. I stopped the DVD and threw it in the trash. Total waste of money.
1,No Fashion. No Music. Just... Scary.,"Ilove Bratz and thought this movie would be just like the others, involving fashions, cool music and cool things. I was really wrong- This is almost extremely scary.This features about 10 year old Bratz coming over a friend's house for a sleepover. They tell scary stories. One is about Sasha getting sucked in a mirror, and never getting out. Next one was when Megan was at the Carnival with two sisters and then everyone suddenly dissapeared. Beware- that episode features scary faces and abnormal creepy laughing. Cloe tells one about a talking dog. Jade tells one about being chased by monsters.I admit I was actually a little SCARED when I went to bed last night. I mean, HELLO PEOPLE. The monsters, clowns, and other things are freaky.I wouldn't reccommend this to anyone. In fact, don't even buy it. I'd give it a zero if I could......."
4,One of the better Bratz Movies!,I have always complained about the Bratz Movies because of the cartoon images of over done makeup and the tight half tops and short short skirts. This movie was the most appropriate for my nine year old and her friends. They wore normal cute clothes for their age group. The movie was multi cultural. It wasnt surpy sweet and the story line flowed well! My only complaint is the music in this movie was not as cool(so my daughter says) as the other movies. I wouldnt really mind buying her the dolls in this series either.
1,Does not hold air,"Like the included hair dryer inflation attachment. But, this mattress will not hold air. Very poor quality based on this most important of all features. Sent back to Amazon."
1,"This is concenterated liquid, not powder.",I ordered this thinking that it is powder. Turned out to be concenterated liquid. The description does not specify whether it is liquid or powder. Going to return this. See how it goes.
1,I'll sell you this book!!!!!!!!,"This is a book for old farts, but even they might want to think twice before buying it. ""Write about your retirement,"" the book says, ""Write about your wedding."" It gives no writing techniques or advice, simply prompts...""write about your first child's birthday!"" And then half of the book is the own author's memoir!!!!!!!!!!! Boring!!! But if you still want to buy it, let me know, and I'd be happy to send it to you!"
2,Only a review,I was hoping this was a bit more but it's really short. It does give you some feel for the move but I would have liked to have seen a bit more.
1,do not buy,"do not purchase this god forsaken horrible frost plug. i got it 2 put in my 98 jeep grande Cherokee and i spent more in anti-freeze then what the plug is worth. all it did was leak all over my drive way. if you really want one i suggest going with the OEM plug (at jeep dealer); that will be worth what ever the price is. my other suggestion is dont install it your self because at least if you bring it to a garage and have it done, they will have to repair it if it does leak and you wont need to waist all your money on anti-freeze."
1,frost pug heater failure,"First one lasted 2 months. Second one lasted 1 month. The element will blow. The second one I put on a timer, so it did not even run all night. It probably had less than 40 total hrs on it. You get what you pay for. I guess for 10 bucks you can't expect too much. Bought my last one of these."
4,Torally satisfied with this Magnalite,Great replacement for my 20+ year old 6 quart Magnalite pot which they apparently no longer make.Works just fine.
2,Does not compare with Wagner Magnalite,"The lid does not fit tightly on the pot. The Wagner Magnalite Dutch oven tops are so tight they create almost a vacuum, lessening cooking time. This product is far less than expected. I'm very disappointed in the product."
1,complaint,the pot started to peel during the first use. the item is not safe to use and i want to return it.
1,Not for sensitive skin or fragrance-sensitive people,"I disagree with the comment that this spray does not have a strong smell. It's not quite perfume, but compared to some ""traditional"" sunscreen lotions, it has a very strong floral scent.Scent aside, this product made me break out in hives everywhere that I used it (arms, neck, shoulders, back). Obviously, I used the product only once, and then gave the remainder to a friend.I like other Neutrogena products, including some of their other ""spray"" (though non-aerosol) products like the Sunless Tanning Spray, but I would strongly *not* recommend this product to anyone with 1) chemical/fragrance sentitivities or allergies (or with family/friends with such sensitivities) or 2) sensitive skin."
5,Easy effective sunblock,"My husband loves this stuff, applies it everyday. Much cheaper locally though - $9.99 minus coupon. Great sunblock!"
1,This stuff sucks!,"My friends and I went to Florida this past weekend, and, based on the reviews of this product, I bought this sunscreen and encouraged all my friends to use it. We are all fair-skinned and had not been in the sun since last summer. Not only did all of us burn to a crisp, but our sunburns are splotchy and uneven."
1,Give me Coppertone!,"Bought this sunscreen based on news show recommendation and reviews on-line. My husband and I (who never burn with Coppertone Sport 30) used this at the beach yesterday (we live in Florida). We are both burnt to a crisp. The areas we applied the sunscreen to the most frequently are the areas burned the worst. I could have used baby oil or butter and not burned any more than I did yesterday. Give me back my Coppertone,please."
4,Random Bald Guy Approved,"I am bald by choice but hate having to always wear a hat out and about. This works well for day-in-the-sun type adventures, but exertion (sweat) and swimming decrease it's efficiency to a noticeable degree. I suspect that others complaining about the splotchyness/getting fried didn't follow the directions, and while it's water resistant to a fair degree (not waterproof), reapplication is necessary. There are other versions of this one with greater or lesser degrees of SPF. I'd give it a 5 star rating if not for the fragrance - it's rather strong and leans away from a neutral scent into the feminine category."
3,"Smells good, is cooling but",I used this sun block religiously last year and guess what? I still got darker. I never burned though but when I would go home I could take off my shorts and see a contrasting difference of skin tone after some time in the sun. So I team this up with the UltraSheer spf 100 sunblock now.
1,Doesn't work as a Sunblock,"I hate having to spend 45 minutes lubing up my kids just to go to the beach. So I was thrilled when I saw this... it would be cleaner, fast... what more could you want.Except that it didn't work! As another reviewer noted, we came back after 2 hours and had a TERRIBLE sunburn.I guess it is back to the greased pig routine... On the plus side, my kids now have a VERY HEALTHY RESPECT for the dangers of the sun! They will NEVER go without sunscreen again because they know just how bad sunburn feels!"
5,One of the best,"Don't buy into the others' replies here. First of all, I am one of the masses of heathen metal fans who can overlook silly messages and enjoy intense passion and talent in the instrumental fraction of music. Same reason I like both old Living Sacrifice and Deicide. They are both on opposite ends of a spectrum. I can laugh at the bozo Satan antics and flip over to one of these 'positive' bands and just simply ignore the dogmatic rhetoric. Yes, Society's Finest have it all: pious, fanatical rants and some of the best breakdowns and grooves I've ever heard. Checkout Eggshell, it does not disappoint."
1,"Misleading album cover, Cookie Monster on Crack vocals.","I was walking though Best Buy last night, Perusing the selections of metal bands and trying to figure out exactly what I should come home with. I routinely pick up a band's cd that Ive never heard of, and Society's Finest was on the shelf... The Sticker says ""Fans of Unearth? LoG? Dillenger Escape Plan? Pick up this album!""This is nothing further than the truth. Im a huge fan of Unearth And LoG, and it was pretty much outright false advertising. The sticker should have read ""Enjoy Zao Style-hardcore? Pick up this album!""The songs are incomprehensible from start to finish. Although I know that there is a market for this sort of music, seeing the success of bands such as Dillenger Escape Plan, Zao, etc. But, It is not my taste in metal at all. And its pretty lame when a band has to resort to trickery to get someone to check out their music.Try again, Society's Finest."
1,Horrible Customer Service,I could not use the chair that they sent me due to the size being to big for me. I went to return the item and it would have cost me $150 to ship it back when I only paid $75 for it. They would not let me unessemble it and put it into a smaller box or send me a return label. So i am not stuck with a shower chair that I can not use and am out $75 due to it. Very unsatisfied with the whole process.
4,Amongst Women,"Michael Moran an unforgiving dominating presence who abuses his daughters who love him unconditionaly and his sons one who leaves, the other beaten and bullied, Michael Moran is a complex man filled with fury. This book has a tender side a great read for a rainy winters night."
5,POWER OF PERSUASION,"Fabulous...Outstanding... Michael Masterson is a master when it comes to leadership , mindset skills and holds valuable keys to your success formula.A guru to the guru's, Michael provides substance and clarity within the ""power of persuasion"".Clarity which during these eroded financial/political times one can truly ""trust"".Don't take my word for it, read it for yourself and discover just how magnificent your life will change. A change you can count on and develop just like you have always dreamed possible...Loyd LaRue CEOLoyd LaRue & Associateshttp://LoydLaRue.com"
3,Step by step instructions,Well written book that focuses on real life examples and ways of persuading people to help you get what you want. Michael concentrates on what has really worked for him in life and gives you these things in an easy to follow format. Each chapter stands alone so you can take it and apply it in your life then move on to the next chapter and apply that.Worth the read but if you really want to get the most out of what Michael is teaching you have to apply it.
4,Power of Persuasion,"HiThe cost of this book is good.The Delivery and condition of thisorder was good.The Shipping charges for this bookis a Big Ripofffff..As for the content of this book...I haveread only part as of yet...however, thusfar the information is this book is Great.RegardsLarry Pelley"
3,Power and Persuasion - boring,I read the first 3 chapters in this book and was fairly disappointed. I was expecting fresher ideas and presentation. If I can't get at least one new worthwhile idea in the 1st 3 chapters then I loose interest. I also think the bullet-point format was bland and took up too much page space. I'm going to pick up the book again when I have nothing better to read.
3,Planting seeds,"Retaining a decidedly old-school hip-hop edge, Illadelph is undoubtedly a great straightforward rap disc featuring tight emceeing and chill instrumentation, but it would take a few discs more until the group would transcend its boom-click-boom roots in favor of more musical-based approaches,"
5,Great,"This is hands down one of the greatest albums done by the Roots. I say this because there is nothing but pure fire on all tracks. The lyrics are great,black thought did a good job on the track entitled ""Respond/React"". This is cd overall is a great cd, must have."
5,No Hip-Hop Head Would be without,"One of the illist albums from one of the illist groups. Contains lyricism hardly matched in the hip-hop world allthough people tend to sleep on this album over other roots albums, I would say that as far as lyrics go this album demonstrates more than any other roots album the depth of their lyrical skill ""no alibi"", ""Section"", if lyrics aren't your favorite drive in an album but you still love the smoothness of the roots style then check out their Things Fall Arpart album also would recommend A tribe Called Quest bottom line this Cd is a must have for true hip-hop heads and lovers of the Roots."
4,Their 2nd Best,"i remember when the first time l listened to this album, i nearly fell asleep. but as i listen to it over and over again, it started to sound so smooth and nice.... i guess it just took me a while to get adapted to their way of rapping. (i'm not fan of their voice tone when they rap...)"
4,Entertaining film with great production values,"Unlike so many US-made films with gay themes, this movie's production values are on par with mainstream cinema. So nice to see a gay-themed movie rise above the mediocrity that is so pervasive in gay offerings available from Netflix. Thank you, Amazon! The writing was humorous, not gut-busting funny. The four principal actors are likable and believable, oh and did i mention all very attractive? The standout performance came from the gorgeous and dumb-as-a-door-knob-next-door neighbor. That actor easily had the best comedic lines and comedy timing among the four principal cast members. The sole female among the four principals was as lovely and talented as her male costars. Her talent for understated physical comedy was impressively subtle."
2,Cute but light,"This is a cute little film. The cast are very attractive and the story is an interesting premise. A fine distraction for 90 minutes, but not going to expand your mind."
4,Pretty Entertaining,"Was a little slow at some points, but over all was entertaining. I'm not disappointed. If they decide to continue with sequels, etc. I would certainly consider purchasing any future releases."
3,Missed the mark,"Buffering? Censoring is more like it. Good story line, but not very revealing. Missed the opportunity of being a tactfully done erotic film by limiting intimacy and poor camera work."
3,"these made in china, older ones made in usa","after reading both the 15 and 18 inch roaster reviews i learned that these magnalites are made in china now and so the testimonies of magnalite quality over many years are no longer valid for these chinese models. what we need are reviews by people who have actually purchased these now available from china. apparently some reviewers of the 18 inchmodel say there are problems now. the reviews for the 15 inch model seem to focus on older usa made models in the family for years...but that isn't helpful since they aren't even made here now. please, some of you who've actually used these new products...write some reviews for us..."
5,Best roasters!!!,Magnalite roasters are the best ones out there. I can't imagine roasting anything from turkey's to hams without these great roasters. Buy one and say good-bye to dry meals!!! I also have theMagnalite Classic 18-Inch Oval Covered Roasterand it's wonderful too. Nice to have both sizes!
4,Very good and durable no moving parts,I have had it for years. my family and friend love the leg of lamb roasted in it.I bought it again this year to give it as Christmas gift to friend who loves cooking. He is very happy with it.One less star? Because it should have a hammock or a basket to lift the road out when done. I am always afraid that while lifting the roast may fall apart and splatter on the counter.
2,Unhappy with product,I have several magnalite pieces given to me several years ago. The quality of this product is much poorer than the others I have. Made in China?
4,usefull cookware,"Cooks roast well, to your degree of doneness. Will try turkey next. Large enough to cook two roast or two chickens."
5,Excellent cookware. Highly recommended!,This was a good deal .It appeared to be unused. I really like the size and the quality of dishes. Only negative is tuns dark when food cooked with acid like tomatoes.
3,Another Chinese Product,"I just received this inflation tool, and was disappointed when I saw the outside of the box. I paid $57.00 for an Amflow product, that I discover, is made in China. I had hoped I would be getting a product that was made in America, by an American company. Not so! If I had known this was going to be the case, I could have saved myself $40.00 and bought one from Harbor Freight. At least there, you know what you are getting when you go in the store. Some disclosure by Amazon and their associate stores would be nice. Now, I just hope it works."
3,The Alwood Family Tree,I have not read this book but I would like to be able to purchase it as the Alwood's are my family and I would like to read it. It states limited availablity so that must mean there is one out there I could get.
4,GOING UP IN THE WORLD?,"This story follows a working class man as he travels upwards. He has broken away from his class and become a educated man. His friends do not understand his need to better himself, and his wife is becoming increasingly hostile. She objects to the time he spends with both his new and his old friends, she also resents his education. On his way up he is asked to help a man on his way down. This brings him conflict in both his professional and personal life. He finds his life becoming more complicated than he had ever imagined. Thoughts of his old life are soon superseeded by his new job, new friends and a new woman in his life."
5,Less sweet than most brands,"This sauce is much less sweet than most brands and is a slightly thinner consistency. The flavor is dominated by tomato, vinegar, and spices. Overall I like it a lot, but if you're looking for a thick, sweet sauce you will be disappointed."
5,quad force the real bass kings !!,i rated it number one besides dj. magic mike and dj fury. they are the bass kings in my book. yours truly john wright. alias dj. pain
2,Deceiving,"I bought this item to try and grow hot peppers in the cool Oregon climate. The first day I put them in it, they got cooked by the sun because of the clear plastic cover. I now have to order a tinted one to filter the sun light to try and save the rest of my fragile pepper plants. I had to read reviews of others that have experienced the same misforture as I. BE WARY if you are a novice gardener like myself of this product. The mistake is costing me another 30 bucks. Just order the tinted greenhouse to begin with."
5,great for starting seedlings indoors,"Unit is easy to put together. Great size for setting up inside next to window. I was able to attach a grow lamp by a clamp and it worked well to keep seedlings warm. Plastic is not too heavy duty, especially if used outside and exposed to the elements. Seems like my plastic cover will make it through 3-4 seasons before needing replacement. Wire shelves do not attach but worked fine for me inside. I found it worth the price."
1,worse product ever,I spent 2 hours getting all of my seeds started to have that stupid green house literally fall apart and tip over spilling all of my seed starts on the ground and wasting all of my time and the money of the seeds. I think this product is the worse thing ever do not buy it will end up costing you more money than buy plant starts from your local garden store. DO NOT BUY!!!
1,Unstable and disappointing,We bought this shelf unit to replace one that was many years old and kind of rickety. This one looks nice but it is way more unstable than the old rickety one. No matter how you place the pots on the shelves it leans and is in danger of falling over. Very disappointing and a waste of money.
3,Needs an air vent in it.,"I put this on my back porch in a sunny spot and kept the front zipped because of the 45 degree nights but because there was no air vents in it, when the temperature hit the sunny 70s during the day, my plants all died and the seeds aren't sprouting at all. I have to go out and zip it closed each night for warmth and unzip and roll it each day for airflow. Plus after buying it, the same exact brand was on sale at a local store for $10. cheaper. Not a good deal."
4,Kitty & the Greenhouse,"I bought this greenhouse for my husband. He's really enjoyed using it and so has the cat. My husband said it was very easy to assemble. Once my husband put the plastic cover on it Sam-cat decided he wanted to make the greenhouse his own and did so by sharpening his claws on the cover. I could have killed him but he runs faster than I. I put tape on it and for now it works okay. I wanted to get a new cover but I have not found where the company sells it seperately. Other than the cover misfortune the greenhouse has held up to the weather nicely. Once the cover is zipped up the wind does like to make it teeter so we tied it to the deck rail so it wouldn't fall. Other than that and the cover having holes in all the wrong places, except for the taped ones, it works well. It is a good size and I'm thinking about bringing it in for the winter, w/o cover, to put my indoor plants on it. Now if I can just find a new cover!? Gardenbug"
1,Your plants will fall through!,"Warning! If you place anything heavier than 1-2 lbs, it will fall through. The so-called wire racks are like chicken coupe wire are the cheapest wire they could use so it does not hold anything heavier than maybe the little seed starters. Not sure how they came up with the image unless they stuffed dry moss in those plastic pots because realistically, the wire trays included do not hold anything over 2 lbs unless it is flat and spread over the entire rack like the seed starters. I returned this product, would have been great if the wire racks weren't so cheap and could actually hold potted plants like in the image. Amazon was great about the return process however."
3,Nice,"Very easy to assemble, must be designed for only smaller plants however as the racks are close together. I have taken the top rack out to accommodate my larger plants."
3,Will no hold standard seed trays,It was easy to assemble and surprisingly sturdy. It took about 5 minutes to assemble and I did not need the instructions. The bad part of the shelves are the dimensions. They have enough room to hold 2 standard 1020 trays but it is too wide and not deep enough for 2 trays unless you keep the cover unzipped.
5,this mini greenhouse is the perfect product for plants at an awesome price,I purchased this greenhouse a couple months ago and just got it set up last week. It works wonders!! This will work for anyone looking to protect their plants from cold and freeze and it makes a great seed starter. This product really works I'd give it a hundred stars if I could! I like it so much just the other day I ordered another one. Gardening is mine and my wife's hobby and we really enjoy our Gardman Rainbow Garden R687 4-Tier Mini Greenhouse!:-)
3,decent but for small plants only,"This is a decent greenhouse for the price, but don't expect to put anything heavy on it.The racks are really weak and bend easily.Otherwise, for the price, you can't beat it."
2,it looks like a green house but acts like an oven.,"it took no more than ten minutes to assemble. i placed the green house in my back yard that gets full sun. i put a batch of starter plants in and walked away, confident i would get larger sturdier starters ready to transplant into the garden.when i went to check the next morning, all the plants had withered. i took out all the plants and waited for mid day to see how hot it would get. it was very hot. there aren't any vents to allow excess heat escape so the top two tiers turned into an oven. no wonder the plants had withered.i had to cut some vents into the top and sides to let the excess heat escape. this did the trick. major design flaw in the green house, but nothing that couldn't be fixed with some tape and cutters any one who gardens should have laying around.my next batch of starters should do well. if i don't update this review (6/22/2012), then they did fine."
2,"Ok, but not great mini greenhouse",I purchased this mini greenhouse to replace one that I had purchased 5 or 6 years ago. It is made out if very flimsy components and I will be surprised if it lasts for more than a couple of years.
1,very flimsy,"I purchased this product from Lowes a couple of years ago, and quickly found out it's not very durable. The wind knocked it over repeatedly, and the shelves and pipe structure fell apart constantly. The concept of it is great, but the pieces are now piled into a trash can in my backyard, waiting to go to the dump, after a couple of years of trying to make it work. Also, the plastic cover took a beating in the sun, and it fell apart too. So, when they describe this as a 'portable' greenhouse, I think that means the wind will blow it all around your yard . . . : ("
2,"very flimsy, unstable","The design of this rack relies on gravity to hold it together. If you need to move it, there is no good way to lift it without the whole thing falling apart. It's not bad for keeping your plants in, but I wish I had spent a little more for something more stable."
5,Great priced mini-greenhouse!,"I was very excited to get this for my birthday! It's shelves aren't the sturdiest, but that can be fixed with twist ties or adding weight. I use this for my Carnivorous Plants including Dionaea, Sarracenia, Cephalotus, and Heliamphora. It does it's job.The thing you will NEED to do is weigh down the bottom by putting 20 lbs. of stuff on it. I used 2 - 10 lb. dumbbells. If you don't apply weight, it will blow around, tip over, etc.Tying it to a sturdy object also works."
4,A useful little item for the price,"By trusting the measurements given, I was able to determine that this greenhouse would fit exactly in the space I had chosen for it indoors. When not starting seeds, it makes an excellent stand for small potted plants such as African Violets. However you need to be careful in where you put it as the frame is very light and could be easily knocked over in a careless moment. When I put it outside to harden off my seedlings this year, it will be placed in a protected area and tied down.I paid around $30 for this and would hesitate to pay any more than $45 dollars for such an item as there are many places on and off the web to buy these"
4,Good so far,Set up in Mar 2011. Worked well all season. Great price. We'll see how it lasts through the winter on the deck.
3,Just ok,"The unit arrived quickly, but one of the shelves was bent inside the box! Too cumbersome to return, I've asked Gardman to replace shelf, awaiting response.The quality is a bit flimsy.....plastic covering very thin, and shelves way too lightweight. I cannot believe this could work outside....I am putting mine in my garage, so we will see."
4,Good if you use it within its limitations,"This is a nice, cheap greenhouse. It is flimsy. It is annoying to put together. However, it does the job.My parents have one of these greenhouses in their backyard. The house shields a lot of the wind so this greenhouse's flimsy nature isn't a factor for them. It is for mild protection. When it is too cold, they move the greenhouse inside the house but in front of a sliding glass door to let in light."
4,Great greenhouse for warm climates,"Bought this for my mom and it is the second one I purchased. The cover finally gave out after several years. She is in Texas and she stores plants in it all winter long so she does not to re-purchase every year. My last one was green and I thought from the picture this was green, but the unit is black with green accents on cover."
4,Pretty good for the price.,"This greenouse goes together in about 10 minutes with no tools as the descriptions says. It's not the sturdiest frame but it should support small plants like those pictured. I added my own wire ties between the shelves and frame to stiffen it up a bit. I don't know what the ""fleece cover"" business was about in the description because it comes with a clear plastic cover with a zippered door which should last several years. I will need to anchor it some way to keep it from blowing over in the wind."
3,Good buy,"This was a pretty good purchase, until i found out that Lowes carried a similar product that happened to be sturdier. Shipping was pretty quick. Assembly was a breeze. But definitely check your local Lowes or HD before committing to this product. Like I said, its a good shelf, but it could be a little more stable and sturdier. Also the plastic seems a little thin to weather the elements down here (i live in Florida), but i guess we'll see."
1,Product broke during assembly,The plastic parts on this product are extremely brittle/cheap. Two pieces broke during assembly.
1,Cheap and structurally unstable,"Great deal.... BUT the rack is extremely weak. I don't know exactly what type of plants this was meant for I put an 18"" rectangular box on the first shelf (bottom) and all was fine then another on the second shelf and it immediately tipped over, breaking my seedlings. It must be on perectly level ground and I would suggest getting some gorilla glue for the posts which do not fit snug in the holes. I finally had to give up because the breeze was making it sway and I didn't want to lose more plants. I guiess you get what you pay for. The green house bag is awesome I will use it with another more sturdy shelf."
4,Gardman 4-tier Greenhouse,"This product is well-worth the money I paid for it. It arrived very fast with all the parts, and was very easy to assemble. I have used these greenhouses before and anchor each shelf with zip-ties to keep them steady in a sea breeze, which seems to work well. I expect this greenhouse to extend my growing season for small plants and especially herbs, which I can leave outside in the greenhouse until the first frost here in Cape May at the Jersey shore."
5,Mini-Greenhouse,Excellent product....I up-dated mine with plywood and four casters on the bottom to make it mobile plus it adds more weight to the bottom to prevent tipping.....
4,Liking it...,"Just as advertised and quite easy to put together, ""plug and play"" if you will. Pieces just snap right in. The only thing I was not too pleased with was the shelving, some came a tad warped and sit on the beams a little off kilter. With the coolmist on the bottom shelf I get a bit of rattling which was alleviated by placing a towel between the shelf and beam.All in all this is a good product for the price."
4,Good starter greenhouse,"Easy to put together, has held up great so far, and is a good mini greenhouse for starting seeds and what not. Certainly worth it for the price."
1,A Piece of Crap,"This is the worst piece of crap I have ever ordered. The poles don't fit tightly in the holes and the whole thing constantly falls apart. The return policy of the seller states that if you open the box and assemble, you can't return it! And there's a 20% restocking fee. How are you to know it's no good unless you open the box. DON'T BUY!"
3,"Good, but...","This product came, as anticipated, with all the pieces and was very easy to set up. Within the first week, the plastic cover was beginning to pull away from the zipper on the front. So now there is a gaping whole in the plastic. (Sort of defeats the purpose). But most importantly, (I live in the Nashville area of TN), it has been blown over by the wind at least 4 times now (I've only had it a month), sometimes WITH plants inside. This has also happened when we put bricks inside to weight it down. My plants get crushed and destroyed everytime it blows over. I think that the plastic acts a some kind of parachute, so if you get a good burst of wind, it lifts the greenhouse and it tips over.Overall, great idea but not functional."
3,indoor not outdoor use,"Well the weather has been up and down and the greenhouse is still in the house for now..I enjoy it but I have to agree with one of the other reviews, you have to zip tie the shelfs or it will not stay together and the zipper , well, be careful, I had it one day and pulled the zipper up, only to rip it and now it wont close anymore. the plastic is a little cheap and this item wont last outside in winds over 10-20 miles an hour if its not strapped down. This is more of an indoor greenhouse, not meant for outdoor weather conditions."
5,Easy to assemble!,"The greenhouse is lightweight and easy to move. I think the greenhouse is truly meant for seedlings and not for larger plants. Because it is so lightweight I think it will be important to use flats for each tier and nothing else. Stability might be a concern; however, I believe we will be using it in an area that is free of wind and has decent sunlight. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to get a head start on the growing season not for someone who has fully grown plants."
3,reasonable,"The product assembles well but it is very tight around the sides. It is hard to zip the flap down all the way since there is no ""give"" in the material and it is stretched too much. Needless to say, one of the zippers doesn't go all the way down. I wish there was a reclosable vent hole at the top (a velcro closure top to allow the steam to vent out).This may work for some people but did not work for me."
2,"Nice plant shelf, but...","The clear plastic has begun to disintegrate after less than a year outdoors; so it's useless now as a ""greenhouse."""
4,Greenhouse,Just as advertised. Goes together easily and is surprisingly sturdy. Just be sure not to place in direct sunlight or your starter plants (and anything else in there) will cook!Nice to have a designated spot for seedlings.
2,Parts missing from box and company doesn't care,"I bought this as a gift for my mom. When I tried to assemble it, I realized two of the horizontal bars that support the shelves were missing from the box. I called the company in Georgia and they gave me a bunch of excuses but said they would ship me two of the missing bars that week. After 10 days had passed, I called them again and they had no record of my first conversation with them and told me that they're currently waiting for more spare parts. The product is made in China so they have to get the stuff from the factory there. The customer service people don't care that I bought a product that I can't actually use because of the missing parts."
2,"Lot's of Gravy, But Where's The Beef?","I am frankly surprised at the rave reviews for this book. There are of course, good, and HIGHLY OBVIOUS concepts here, but there are lawyer marketing resources on the web--for free--that offer much more nuts and bolts useful stuff than this book. Where are the specific resources, where is the HOW TO in this supposed how to? Very disappointed in this work. Other rainmaking books in this field are superior. Do you really need some expert to tell you take notes in a client interview and to acknowledge how the client feels? That's salesmanship 101 for Christ's sake! Save your money folks--unless you are some newbie without a clue first starting out...even then get thee to the web and the free resources for lawyer marketing before shelling out the shekels for this one."
3,Just Fair,"It was OK, but not that great. At $50, it should have been great. The book, ""Good to Great"" is much more practical."
2,Hmm...,"Roger Ebert's a very good writer of critical analysis, and I read his reviews every week religiously. However, there's something that just doesn't seem right about this book. It just seems like there wasn't much effort put into it. Ebert pieced together a book made from essays and chapters from other books by other people, and he gives an unenlightening introduction to each of them. There are some good pieces in here (I especially like the ones by Klaus Kinski, Charlie Chaplin, Woody Allen, and John Waters), but it's hardly a major work by the respected film historian."
2,"New album, modified lineup, can't bring it home.","10,000 Maniacs first album with new singer Mary Ramsey is listenable and promising. But as a stand-alone effort it falls short of the Maniac standard set with Natalie Merchant. All the songs have catchy intros, but instead of building and climaxing they wilt and die. Even the perky cover of Roxy Music's ""More Than This"" tapers off after teasing the listener for a minute or so. This new incarnation, like many of their songs, show signs of promise. The question is can Mary Ramsey learn to express herself as a singer/lyric writer a bit more deeply and sustainably."
5,A Great Album,"This is a really great album to have, depending on if you are a avid fan of 10000 Maniacs. With a new lead singer, Mary Ramsey, these guys thought they could do nothing wrong until they wound up losing guitarist Robert Buck to liver cancer in 1999, aged just 42.Anyway, the songs are good and overall the album has to be considered a classic. Enjoy while you still can."
2,Nice try!,"After Natalie Merchant left the 10,000 Maniacs, the band was destined to die. Mary does a good job of trying to sing like Natalie, but she just doesn't cut it. Nice try, but they all might be better off going solo like Natalie did."
3,I miss Natalie,"I bought this cd not knowing Natalie merchant wasn't on it.I don't want to take it out on Mary Ramsey or the 10,000 Maniacs. Mary Ramsey has a great voice, but it's just not Natalie."
2,"Not the best 10,000 Maniacs album...","I always loved the 10,000 Maniacs and every album they put out. Since there was a new lead singer I didn't expect this album to be ""In My Tribe"" all over again, but I did expect it to be better. Mary is a good vocalist, but the songs all sound pretty much alike and kind or boring. There were really only one song that I appreciated and that was ""A Room For Everything"". If you loved 10,000 Maniacs with Natalie Merchant you probably won't like this album (or not as much as even Blind Man's Zoo). Natalie Merchant's solo album ""Tigerlily"" sounds like it would be another classic 10,000 Maniacs album, but with less instrumentation. So if you liked the way the 10,000 Maniacs were, buy Natalie Merchant's solo albums."
5,"10,000 Maniacs Live On","Thoroughly good cd. The songs are classic Maniacs. Mary Ramsey is a more than adequate replacement for Natalie Merchant. She has a beautiful voice that works nicely with the music. The songs are not quite as stimulating as some of the previous Maniac songs, but are highly enjoyable. Maniac fans will not be disappointed. I certainly an not."
3,CAUTION - NO NATALIE,"That's right, somehow the band got away with using the name without their trade mark vocalist. But all things weighed up, this album holds some pleasant suprises once you get over the bitter realisation that this is not a reunion album. The musicianship is actually getting better, and the vocals do strive towards the original intent, but this band really should trade under a different name."
1,Nothing without Natalie!!,"These guys are nothing without Natalie. Sorry guys, but Nat wrote practically all the good hits you had, she had the chrisma, she was the band. Mary you're good, but you are not a Maniac. This band should have changed their name after Natalie left because this new sound does not compete with the original sound. Its like the way it is when you drink diet soda, the sugar is missing. Well Natalie is missing and it just is not nor will it ever compare to the original sound."
4,"10,000 Maniacs","Good CD, A little different from the earlier Natalie Merchant stuff but some good soothing stuff. It's not for everyone if don't like soft music but Mary Ramsey's got a great voice."
2,Bad bad bad,Movie is horrible bad acting bad effects is just sooo bad it will put you to sleep...I love how low budget movies drop the boom mike in the picture...the only bright spot is the beatuiful jackey hall .
3,Not bad for a micro budget,"It's got everything you want from a ""dont go into the woods"" horror flick, blood, gore and boobs galore ! Low budget ? Yes. Decent FX ? Yeah. Lots of dead bodies ? Yep. Beautiful topless coeds ? Yep. If you liked Wrong Turn, or any of the killer in the woods genre, you'll at least like this. Give it a try."
5,Great Map!,"I love this map! It's laminated, durable, easy-to-read, and so full of information that you almost don't need a guide book to accompany it. Love it."
1,Don't waste your money,"You're better off with the maps you can get at your hotel, or at virtually any newsstand. Or the map on your smartphone. We bought this and found it hard to read, with many streets mislabeled. I suppose it will hold up longer through rain, and being folded and unfolded constantly (as one is wont to do with a map), but that's about it. Not necessary."
3,Definitely not gold,"The bags I got were cute and the size I wanted, but they were definitely more of a butterscotch color instead of gold. The color in the picture and the bags I received were definitely different."
5,Beatrix Potter Decoupage,"Beatrix Potter Decoupage is excellent for parent's and childrenalike who adore the creations of Beatrix Potter. This book providesall of the information necessary to create lavish nusery accessories from Potter's art by hand. This book made for the frugal in mind teaches, for example, how to make a decoupaged lamp. I myself wanted to have this beautiful nursery accessory but could only find Beatrix Potter collections in expensive beautiques. With this book I was able to decorate en entire nursery for only a fraction of the cost. And knowing about Potter's life and her simplicity, I feel that she would prefer it that way! END"
1,Too much odor,"I wanted this because it had marine collagen in it and is free from parabens, mineral oil, propylene glycol and GMOs. The scent was so strong I had to wipe it off to sleep. Ended up returning it the next day and ordering Mario Badescu Seaweed Night Cream instead. That product also has a scent, but more like a mild soap."
3,A Descent rendition of Beethoven's 9th Symphony.,"This is a very descent recording of Beethoven's 9th Symphony and especially if you are just trying to find a good recording. My favorite recording is by Bruno Walter made back in 1947 with the London Philharmonic Orch., but that is because Walter was very big on composers like Beethoven, Bruckner, & Mahler. But as for this recording, it is a well made version with a very good tempo of about 65-67 minutes in length; the average timing of this symphony is about the same. The only drawback to this version is that it isn't an exciting version, unlike Walter's or even Von Karajan's 1963 edition on the DG label. You should be able to get either of the other 2 renditions just mentioned here on Amazon.com."
1,i bet my neighbor's 90's home movies are more enjoyable,"everyone else on here pretty much hit the nail on the head. why this was released or rather ""made available"" is beyond me. did someone actually think there would be even ONE person that would like this crap? i think hating it is the best anyone can do."
1,BEYOND GARBAGE WASTE OF SPACE AND TIME AND MONEY,THIS WAS JUST A BS REHASH OF TWO ADN THREE CLIPS NOT EVEN A MOVIE I COULDVE WATCHED YOUTUBE. THE GIRL WAS NOT EVEN ANGELA!
1,Bad bad bad,"This thing is a mess. The quality is worse than you'd think it would be, given the price and the ""story"" makes no sense. I appreciate the effort but this was a waste of money."
1,Awful!,"Awful! The picture quality is third generation VHS at best. How can Amazon.com pawn this junk off on people. The only survivors are the people who get through this dreck. The picture quality is so fuzzy, it's headache inducing. Also, because it's a cheaper Dvd-R, anytime the camera moves, the picture pixelates and tiles. If you just have to see the ""lost footage"", buy the old Anchor Bay box set as it is included on a fourth disc inserted into the set. The Sleepaway.com website says this was a ""Labor of love"". If it's love, then Ike Turner edited it, and is forcing you as Tina the viewer to watch it. Horrible!"
1,Terrible,"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the Sleepaway Camp series. This movie (if you wish to call it that) is simply a compilation of clips from the other films. There is maybe a maximum of 4 minutes of new film. Do yourself a favor and forget this ""movie"" even exists."
1,HORRIBLE!,"What in the world were they thinking, they should have never even bothered releasing this. Most of it was flashbacks of the original films and then 2 seconds of the actual film which did not even make sense! :|"
3,It's alright,I love the sleep away camp movies and this one had nothing new into it. It is like the puppet master legacy. Clips from other movies.
1,What tha??,This is probabaly the worst movie I have ever seen. Angelas secrets are revealed what tha heck did that mean she is only in flashbacks from the previous 3 film I warn u do no waste ur money on this like I did on this piece of trash!!!
2,Missed the mark,"This might be a good book for someone who don't have any design experience. I was looking for direction in how to begin as a novice with some training rather than starting from scratch. This book is for those who would say, ""Hmm should I get into graphic design? Where do I start I no absoultely nothing?"". The description just wasn't very helpful to me."
3,Where's the Meat?,"I think Joe did an excellent job of describing what seasonal/seasonal spreads are, but gave me little in the way of new ideas for trading them, or new research into spreads that really work. Most traders would be much better off with a subscription to Moore Research if they already know they would like to trade futures in this manner."
