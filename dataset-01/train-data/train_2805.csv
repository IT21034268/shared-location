5,Twentysomething,"Shipment was prompt and the product is great! Glass CD case was slightly damaged. Perhaps this occurred during the shipment. That's the only thing disappointing about my buying experience. However, that could've happened during the transit. Good service!"
4,Better than the next ...,"This CD is a good, solid jazz vocal album. It seems to lack something, however, and with his follow-up CD (""Catching Tales"") it hit me what it is: If Jamie Callum would get his compass on, he could outshine some of the best, including Michael Buble and Harry Connick Jr. He's got the voice, the timing, and the piano chops, but he seems to lack a real sense of what he wants to do. When a singer gets a recording deal and studio time, I suppose the temptation is always there to poke around in various genres, but, personally, I'd like to see him do what he does best: SWING."
3,What I expected - different; refreshing,Saw a profile of Jamie Cullum on Sunday Morning on CBS a few years ago. Took note and am glad I invested in his work. Probably add another CD in time. If your looking for some good piano playing and a unique voice this would be a sound investment.
3,Stick to Originals Next Time,"I really liked Jamie Cullum's style of singing and the jazzy feel of the songs, but I didn't enjoy his renditions of Jimi's ""The Wind Cries Mary"" or of Radiohead's ""High and Dry"". The Radiohead song is a great one...when sung by Thom Yorke and backed by the geniuses that make up the rest of Radiohead. But hearing Jamie Cullum's voice on those high notes made me cringe. And ""The Wind Cries Mary"" is just one of those classic songs that only Jimi Hendrix can really sing. Maybe I'm too much of a purist, but I think good things should just be left as they are.Other than that rant, I loved his others songs, like ""All at Sea"". Very chilled."
1,Absolute rubbish!,"How ANYONE can think this is even remotely connected to good sininging is beyond me. Off key, very little voice and so lacking in any real musicality. Peter Cincotti move over - I think I just discovered the impossible - a worse male singer. Uggghhh"
3,"He did not cover that song...oh no, he did.","Jaime Cullum has his own unique vocal style but on this album he bites off more than he can chew. He gave his own unique twist on some amazing songs but fell flat when it came to Jeff Buckley's "" Lover, you should've come over"". I chose this song, in particular, because it is a prime example on how not to approach a modern classic. Cullum said himself that he wanted to bring out the ""pop"" he heard in the song. Anyone even remotely familiar with Jeff Buckley will likely agree with me when I say that there isn't a shred of ""pop"" in it. ""Lover..."" is damn near close to perfection with it's poetic lyrics and the unforgettable voice that drives it. Sorry Mr. Cullum but your version lacks the passion that the late Jeff Buckley intended it to have."
3,Solid Effort,"I would say this is a solid effort. Some of the songs are hit or miss. ""High and Dry"", for instance is horrific. However, ""It's About Time"", is a great Saturday or Sunday morning song. Vocally, Cullum's sound is a middle ground between Harry Connick and Josh Kelly. The original songs are much better on this CD than the covers as his voice sometimes is lost in the arrangements. This CD right now is bargain priced at under $8, so it is a great buy at that price. If you want this CD get it now, because 2 years from now no one will remember who Jamie Cullum is. People that are in love with Cullum as the flavor of the month for their record collection are not going to enjoy this review, but it's the truth or, in the case of him still being an unknown two years from now, will be."
3,Vinnie Rates,I saw Jamie Cullum which promted me to buy the CD. The CD was not as electricfing as his concert appearance.
2,not worth your time,"a friend of mine recommended jamie cullum, and i loved These are the Days and the cover of Frontin'. Everything else on here was pretty lame. The cover of The Wind Cries Mary bordered on sacreligious."
4,One to Watch,"I came across Cullum when a friend gave me a mixed disc of songs. On it was Cullum's cover of Radiohead's High & Dry -- he gives the song a quiet majesty not found in the original. Wonderful tune.The rest of his disc is a showcase of the young pianist's vocal stylings. Reminiscent of early Harry Connick Jr. or even Billy Joel, Cullum comfortable switches from big band to jazz to rock and roll. Mixing his own compositions with those by Radiohead, Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Buckley and Cole Porter, he convincingly makes each song his own. His older brother Ben composed two songs and did the arrangements for the album.Next year, expect to see him playing much larger venues. Jamie Cullum is definitely one to watch"
4,A CD worth buying,"When i first saw Jamie cullum on VH1 i was glad to see a young person trying to livein up jazz. So i went and brought the CD and loved it! Its got lots of energy and its got a song for everyone. Yes it does have some flaws such as ""lover you should have come over"" is not the best cover ive ever heard but its a different take on the song. So with that i say buy the CD its worth your time"
5,Just a person who loves music....,"I listen to music constantly, every minute, but this album really caught my attention. I really love it! I play it several times a day and have not grown tired of this or another one of his I purchased. I find him to be a very talanted, multi style, mixture of everything I love to hear. I definitely recommend this cd."
5,Incredible,"Jamie Cullum has an amazing voice and this particular CD has an incredible mix of songs, from Jamie's own writing to classics like ""Singing In The Rain"". Absolutely my favorite modern jazz artist, ranking among the likes of Jack Johnson and Michael Buble."
3,Not bad by any means,"He's not the world's greatest singer. His voice gets a bit irritating in the higher register. I like the feeling he conveys, he's having fun, he's young, all that. I didn't think that it was a very consistent album. But when he's on, he's on. ""I Get a Kick out of you"", ""Frontin"" and ""I could have danced all night have great piano solos, with ""Frontin"" having my favorite solo. He really knows what he's doing on those ivories. I could do without four or five of the slower songs, again his voice gets to me on those. I hope his next albums feature less singing and more instrumentals. He's not exactly jazz, and he doesn't try to be. The potential for great things is there."
4,A Beginner's Guide to Piano Jazz,"First off, I would really like to give this album four and a half stars, but that's not an option, so I'll make him fight for the full five with his next album.If one is not hip to Sinatra, Diana Krall, Harry Connick, or even Chick Corea, this is an excellent album to use as a stepping stone into appreciating such artists. He dares to cover well known songs from all throughout the musical spectrum, from such groups as Radiohead, N.E.R.D., Cole Porter, and so on, and somehow transforms them into versions that Old Blue Eyes would be proud to belt out, while still being true to the original versions. His own compositions are just as good if not better than the covers (I personally love the latin sound he has on Next Year, Baby). Jamie's compositions are done with a skill that most do not aquire until much later in life.The point is, if you are bored and looking for a more ""refined"" genre to get into, this is a must have."
5,"Enjoyable, calming, warm","This CD is enjoyable, comforting, gives you a warm feeling. I love it, and it's one of those special cd's where you don't have to skip half of the songs. You can listen right through from track 1 to 15, and just let it ""play"". I love his voice, the backing musicians, the songs. I like very much the words for some of his original tunes, they are straightforward and I can identify with them.If you like ""All At Sea"", which I had heard on the radio and is what prompted me to buy the CD (All At Sea is sublime, in my humble opinion), you will like this CD, I'm pretty darn sure.I don't think that being novel or original in and of itself is a valid ""quality"" of music. Artists do covers, and do music that is similar to others' all the time; this isn't wrong. It's whether or not the music ""works"", that's the key. Jamie's music really works for me on this lovely CD."
2,Jazz he ain't,"Let's not mince words - this isn't jazz. Jamie would be much more at home at a hotel restaurant in the middle of nowhere singing these ballads than as a ""pop star"". He also gets the ""Worst Jeff Buckley Interpretation"" award for ""Lover, You Should've Come Over"". He just doesn't have the vocal or piano skills - I'm amazed that he's gotten this far (actually, I guess I shouldn't, given the current state of pop)."
5,jamie is the real deal,jamie is both the best entertainer I've seen in recent years but also the very best musician......he has the whole package. ike the AP review said : Buy this CD
2,Good but horrid,"Jamie Cullum is a very talanted individual no doubt. But I have to say that I was less than impressed with this album especially due to so many cover songs. Cullum's cover of Jeff Buckley's ""Lover, You Should Have Come Over"" makes me want to vomit and cry at the same time."
4,Wealth of Information,"This is not your Alex Haley ""Roots"" type book. It is closer to a reference manual. This book provides a wealth of information on the Chinese and Indian migrants to the West Indies. There is extensive research on the routes, places of origins, and multiple census type information that does not seem to be taught these days. Highly recommended!"
4,Family ties to ex-indentured servants,"For those wanting to explore an indepth account of indenture this is a reliable and enlightning source. If you have a passion for Caribbean literature, having read this book will make the Caribbean novels you read come alive, because it gives the historical account of how the Chinese and Indian migrants arrived in the West Indies and of all the vicissitudes they endured. For many years the focus of intelectuals had centered on the arrival of the African slaves and their work in the sugar cane plantations of the West Indies. Now, Indentured Labor, Caribbean Sugar allows us to have a full picture of the migrants that constitute the greater part of the population of former colonies like Trinidad and British Guiana, among others, and establishes a basis for comparison between the two waves of migrations: the imposed African migration and the latter ""voluntary"" one described in this book."
3,"Love these curlers, but...","I had these u-shaped rollers when they were called ""Perm for a day"".Love the curls I get BUT I am not a fan of the clips that hold your hair around the u-shaped rollers with this set.Not sure what else I could use because of the heating elements to set the curl."
4,THE SECOND TIME AROUND,"If you read ELLA's biography written by STUART NICHOLSON,you know that NELSON RIDDLE was the first choice of NORMAN GRANZ to arrange material for the songbooks.But in 1956,RIDDLE was a very busy man,working with SINATRA,PEGGY LEE and DEAN MARTIN on lps that are now considered classics.ELLA's first time at bat with NELSON was the mamooth GERSHWIN songbook of 1959.After that, they worked many times together.This 1972 album with several tracks recorded in 1978 is certainly of interest to any FITZGERALD fan,even if SO NEAR AND YET SO FAR,AFTER YOU and WITHOUT LOVE are not among PORTER's greatest songs.I CONCENTRATE ON YOU is in bossa-nova,and if you ever heard DOWN IN THE DEPTH in it's original rendition,you'll rave over this one.It may not surpass the 1956 recordings that kicked off the songbook series,but it's a nice compagnon."
5,love it,I have an Icelandic horse and we were doing a show at the fairgrounds. I used this flag to decorate his stall.The flag was a good size and I liked the quality of it.
4,US Format PLEASE!,"Wonderful film, why no U.S. version?? I would love to replace the tired VHS copy I bought from a defunct video rental store."
4,and the sky was made of amethyst,"its a great cd, with great live versions of violet, doll parts, drown soda, and beautiful covers of over the edge, pale blue eyes and hot chocolate/forming"
5,Not just for kids.,"I'm a best-selling author of both fiction and non-fiction books. Don't even remember how I came upon ""The Remarkable Journey of Prince Jen,"" but I enjoyed it immensely, and it's worth revisiting annually, such as I do other favorites, such as Siddhartha, or Lord of the Rings. This book is most certainly not just for kids. I'm surprised it's not a perennial best-seller. Alexander has shown himself to be a master story-teller in this book, which remains personal, humorous, human, even as it touches on mythic proportions. For young or old, it's a must-read book."
3,A good Book,"The Remarkable journey of Prince Jen is a good book for many reasons. There are many different charecters, a good plot and there are good morals and values. Also, at the end of each chapter, Lloyd alexander sums up what happened in that chapter in case you got confused!"
4,Good-But not Prydain,"Prince Jen's story is engaging, and funny. It is well-written, and the characters are interesting, but it can get tedious in places. Overall I would recommend it to Lloyd Alexander fans, but it does not rise to the beauty and power of Prydain. (Which I've read 14 times)."
3,a different kind of fable,"Lloyd Alexander has written a fairytale in novel form. It is reminiscent of Arabian Nights stories, but it is set in China. At the end of each chapter is a group of the questions that have been left unanswered. This adds to the style or is an annoyance, depending on how you look at it. Fans of Alexander's Pyrdain Chronicles may be interested in this alternative, although it is not as engaging."
5,Camera Case,Great case for carrying camera and charger together. Case also has a pouch inside for extra memory storage. Protects the camera and charger if you drop it. I Also like the magnet to keep the case closed rather than a zipper or snap.
4,Perfect size for Sony RX100,"This is a really nice, well made case, with supple leather that is firm enough to offer good protection, but soft enough not to feel like cardboard. The red is a really nice, warm-but-not-garish shade, with a stylish suede accent. It closes with an invisible magnetic snap, and it fits the Sony RX100 perfectly.I wish there were some way to attach a neck strap (a loop on either side, perhaps?). Otherwise, 5 stars."
1,Lowepro Napoli 30,"First this is a very well made camera case.However, I was told that the Olympus XZ-1 wouldfit into this case.It doesn't, the case is too small.So now I have a useless camera case."
5,Little bit of everything,"I was quite surprised by this collection. I actually bought this for one song Highland's ""Magic Fortuna"". Somehow techno and Carl Orff's masterpiece just go well together and the female vocals are pleasant. If you haven't seen the video I recommend looking it up on You Tube.So I spent $25 bucks for one song but there are plenty of goodies for easy listening on this disk if you like to have something in the background going for ambiance. ""clocks"" is another good one as is ""for the wounded"" and ""gone"" which has some lovely violin work without being folksy.The only complaint I could have is that the disc has a few too many uplifting songs. When I'm sad I don't care for bright music and when I'm happy I don't care for it either."
2,Not enough for a whole book,"While this book was interesting, I agree with the other reviewers who felt it was written too soon. If the author had waited for a trial, perhaps it wouldn't have been necessary to fill the book with pages upon pages of other unrelated crimes. While the ""bully of Skidmore"" story is interesting, it really has nothing to do with this case. Likewise, the death/disappearance of Bobbi Jo's relatives don't have anything to do with this case. All of the paragraphs detailing other women who had babies cut from their wombs, while at least similar to this case, really seemed to be added just to fill up space to make enough pages for a whole book."
2,200 pages too long,"Of the 246 pages in this book, less than half had anything to do with the title story. Since the suspect in this case was apprehended with the baby within about 24 hours of the crime, there really was no story to write about. The author instead filled in with other crime stories not connected to this case. Those other stories were actually more interesting than the main story. This book was also proofread poorly - there were a number of typos, even phrases that were missing words. This was obviously written in a hurry to sell books. This was one of the poorest true crime books I've ever read."
2,disappointment,"bought this book to read about the gruesome killing of this young woman by this phyco lady, but to my disappointment the book is 75% about some other cases and 25% about this killing."
3,Sad and depressing,"I agree with the reviewers who said this was written too soon, and was too short on information on the title case. That said, the other incidents that the author wrote about are just horrid. I wasn't familar with the other caesarian abductions in more than a very general way. The Brandon Perry disappearance was new to me also, and the likely circumstances of his death is one of the most disturbing things I've read in a true crime book.Overall this book made me feel very sad and hopeless about humanity."
1,Terrible Stinker,I can't stand these ambulance chaser true crime books. Way too soon with no trial and very little information. The author barely squeaks out enough pages for this to be called a book and instead pads it with all sorts of filler from other unrelated cases. Poor writing and worst of all it's boring. Stay far away from this terrible stinker.
3,A bit waffly,"A great book with so many interesting facts and evidence of the events of the bobby Jo stinnett murder. At times the book goes off on so much of a tangent that you forget what the book you are reading is actually about and which case the book was based on. It felt like the whole book was summed up in the first 20 pages. Other than that, it was so well researched and written."
5,James Felix An Anointed Bi-lingual Soulful Wonder,"This hard to find project ""White As Snow""by James Felix came out in the early 80's on Light Records along with Kristle Murdern's ""I Can't Let Go"" incredible production, arrangements, and vocal performance. Ralph Carmichael's Light Recording Company was just that light years ahead of its time. Both projects are time-less works of anointed Gospel Genius. Both artist are from the living legendary camp of Andrae Crouch."
1,This Is 16-Bit Software!,"I examined this program, but chose NOT to buy it. Unbelievably, this is 16-bit--not 32-bit--software (i.e., from the Windows 3.x era). Hey, guys, Windows 95 was released over six years ago, and you were promising a 32-bit upgrade over two years ago! What gives?Don't waste your money."
5,party till the break of dawn,"Let me tell you...I have been to many of Lara and Elizabeth's parties over the years and they are by far and away the best ever. And now with their new book, I can try to copy their brillant ideas and add my own personal twist for an ideal dinner party. Don't walk, run to buy this book before it sells out."
1,Useless!,"I will also be returning this book. I am an event planner and I'm always looking for new ideas. There is nothing in this book for me. If you plan events for sororities, you may be able to use it. And the photos of celebrities, what's that about?"
1,Useless...Not for Serious Event Planners,"I am an event planner who is always looking for new inspirations, and I found this book to be one of the worst event planning books I have ever purchased. Here are the lowpoints..to summarize: poorly written; non-descript black and white photos; useless celebrity namedropping; tired suggestions for invites, florals & decor; shameless self promotion; ""chic tips"" that are FAR from chic. My recommendation? Continue your search for an event resource book, there are plenty out there that have proven to be much more useful than this one!"
5,Genius!,"Loved this book so much, haven't even finished reading it and I want to use all of Elizabeth's and Lara's party tips! No wonder I throw such bad parties -- I had no clue before I dove into Fete Accompli! Looking forward to being the first girl on the block to throw a mani-pedi party!"
1,Use it in your fireplace,"I thought this book would be about open adoption, but it's not. ""Allowing"" the birthmother and child to see each other for only 18 months then severing contact is not open. I am part of an open adoption myself, and I hope anyone who reads this book realises that it's not how an open adoption really works."
1,Don't bother,"The setting of this book seemed interesting--I enjoy books that convey a real sense of place, but by the time I got about 150 pages into it, I quit. Every character was unappealing, the murders were incredibly grisly, and I had a stack of better books waiting to be read. At least I hadn't bought the book, someone shared it with me, so I didn't waste my money, only my time. You know you've made a mistake when you keep wondering how much longer it will take to finish!!"
5,McGraw-Hill's GED Short Course : The Most Compact and Reliable Program for GED Success,EXCELLENT ITEM!!!
5,This Is Solid State Volume 3 cd review,"This is one of the best compilation cds I've ever heard or seen!Amazing hardcore, metal, and punk Christian bands fill this volume up from start to finish.Catch Demon Hunter's first studio release on this cd ONLY (Through the Black remix) or Project 86's Spy Hunter Demo remix.Other notable mentions include:ZaoLiving SacrificeFew Left StandingBlindsideNorma JeanStill Breathingand more.Check it out if you are looking for some late 90's early 00's Christian metal."
2,It did NOT give me any energy...,"I love Yogi teas especially because theyre all made organic & there is so much variety in choosing all the best flavors in the market, however, I bought this flavor based on the reviews on here, how this would give me energy. I guess it all depends on the person and/or every b o d y IS different however, it didn't do anything to me nor did I like the taste its too minty & has no flavor, I felt like I was drinking a tea made out of salt & pepper. I dont know in my opinion this is the only Yogi flavor I am not please with."
1,Toy is not as it states on the description,"I bought this product assuming from the description that I could somehow plug it into my TV and my daughter could learn to play the piano. When I got it, though, it has a cartridge similar to the Leapster products and requires a special keyboard. I have to return the product and now I get to pay for shipping again, too."
1,could not get it to install,"After three tries to download and install, I removed it from my account. To bad, my grandchildren might have liked it."
3,If you love Sci-Fi,"If you love Sci-Fi, you will like this product, if you aren't familiar with Sci-fi, you probably won't. There are a lot of questions I could ask about the stories, because I am unfamiliar with space terminology.You must change the pages an awful lot, this takes several steps each time."
2,Poorly Designed,"I purchased this doll as a Christmas gift for my then 3 year old daughter. When she opened the packaged she was disapointed! She did not like the way this Strawberry looked. Once we got her out of the package her opinion did not change. This doll is very awkward. Her big plastic head weighs 10x what the rest of her skinny flimsy body weighs and her hair is a matted mess. My daughter never played with this doll and it ended up in the Goodwill box less than a year later. Even at [..], it was not worth buying. Save your money and get a better quality Strawberry doll."
2,"my connector broke too, on the first use...","The connector is nice and small, but the head that plugs into the PDA socket depends upon these two little plastic protrusions for mechanical support. One of the two protrusions broke off the first time I used it. I have no choice but to buy another one, I guess. So be careful when you plug it in, treat it really gently."
1,What a rip-off! It is not compatible with the zire,"I was extremely disappointed to find out that this recharger does NOT fit the Zire, despite the product description. It is useless to me."
1,I got screwed by Amazon,"I ordered a new palm zire 71 and the Hot sync cable, item Sku - 692368 only to receive the original box...totally empty!!I got nothing in the Amazon express box.. but air and foam peanuts.I'm Piss'd............. Don't do business with Amazon!!!!I'm trying to find a number to call someone -..... can't find it on the web site.I'll be buying from Best Buy in the future!"
3,Very fussy,"This would be a good portable solution if they can make it work right. The connection to the Palm Tungsten T is very loose, and you have to prop up the cable at the right angle for it to make a good connection. You cannot move your PDA while it is hotsyncing or the connection would be broken."
2,weak product,"I've had this synch cable to about a month, and one of the plastic tabs that should help hold the Palm in place for hot synching broke off. So, now I have to hold my Palm against the cable connection. I flat surface for synching is highly recommended. Now, I'm looking for a new cradle that is more durable. I do like that it is portable, and can charge my Palm in a car or just through the USB cable."
2,Doesnt fit well.,I have to put a rubberband around the PDA and cable to get a tight enough fit. Dont recommend buying this!
3,"Yup, mine broke too.","This cable works fine IF you have a nice flat surface and are careful when you insert the connector into the Palm. But how many times can you find a nice flat surface in a car? You would have thought the engineers who designed it would have considered that it might be used in a car (since it comes with a cigarette lighter adapter). Anyway, mine finally broke. Maybe it's ""planned obsolescence."""
4,No problems whatsoever - and it travels great!,"I bought my cable 2 months ago and have been waiting to write a review until I had this item in constant use for a while. I love this cable. I've had no problem connecting and syncing my m515 every day at work, I've taken it on the road with my laptop twice, and there has been no issue with maintaining the connection, syncing or any of the other issues listed in the other reviews.I was nervous about buying this product because of the negative comments in some of the other reviews. My need for a hotsync cable for work and travel won out, and I ended up giving this cable a chance because it is so much lighter and compact than a full cradle.I am happy with my purchase so far. I've recommended it to others and they are just as happy as I. I'd certainly buy it again."
1,Flimsy connector broke after two uses,"I was also very disappointed with this connector. I wanted the convenience of having a small, light weight cable to hot synch and recharge my Zire71 on my business travels instead of lugging the bulky cradle and power adapter.However, after just two uses, a portion of the plastic connector that seats into the Palm snapped off! Even before this happened, the connector just didn't seat tightly into the Palm (it had a lot of ""wiggle room"" such that if it wasn't seated just right, it wouldn't recharge or hot synch).I do not recommend buying this product unless Palm redesigns it.(BTW: I ended up buying the iConcepts USB HotSync and Charger, and it has been working fine for the past 6 months)"
4,Does the job nicely - just handle it with respect,"The high point: It works.The low point: It isn't the most robust design with the clips and contacts exposed to the world. An extension on the underside would help protect the contacts.In the end, it is inexpensive, and does just what it claims to. Just give it a safe home in your laptop bag so the clips or contacts don't snag on anything and don't try to use it while jogging."
3,Fire and Sword - a sweeping panorama of fictional history.,"""Fire and Sword"" is a very entertaining account of how the Poles perceive their history, even if historically inaccurate.Somewhat long-winded and overbearing, ""Fire and Sword"" provides a sharp contrast to Nikolai Gogol's ""Taras Bulba"", a far superior book, written by a far superior author. Nevertheless, ""Fire and Sword"" is fun to read, as long as one forgets the real issues between Ukrainians and Poles, and who was the villain and who the victim."
1,"Not only ahistorical, but also boring","The book is widely recognized in Poland (the film that is based on the book recently attracted 7 milion viewers), and at the same time almost unanimously rejected in Ukraine. Why? It simply falsifies history of conflicts between the two nations (guess, who is good and who is bad). So, if anybody wants to know something about the true history of the region, should not use the book as his/her source of information. Moreover, the romance (that's what is left after we notice it has no historical value) is perfectly predictable, and boring. Definitely, there are many other pieces of Polish literature, that are worth reading - do not waste time on the doubtful ""masterpiece""."
5,There are no words..................,"What a mix, Granz and Vaughan, the songs, musicians all come together to make a brilliant album. LOVE IT."
3,ok but no cigar,Exellent musicians but the overall effect is a bit boring - not up to her best recordings IMHO
1,Song Selection?,"I have several SV albumns. Her voice on this one is GREAT!Her backup musicians are GREAT!Her song selections , where horrible! In my opinion."
5,How Long Has this been going on?,"This is an excellent, hard-to-find, jazz album. Sarah Vaughan's voice only improved with age. Oscar Peterson's magnificent piano makes the perfect accompaniment. I could listen to it over and over again."
5,A TRUE JAZZ LOVER'S MUST HAVE!!,"Sarah's vocals are excellent, and like few other vocalists in any genre, the quality of her voice improved as she got older. On this album she showcases her true vocal range, style and abilities..I would have loved to have seen her live.."
2,"cool guy, don't expect to learn anything!",junior was one of the best. so sad that his life ended 10 yrs. ago. i like watchin the video for entertainment but if you want to learn something you better pass this one up. completly useless for any level of harp player. no instructional lessons at all. just some jammin with arlen roth.
3,fuzzy picture,when rf modulator is on and tv is on there is a very fuzzy picture. when modulator is off it clears back up. Modulator works fine with dvd in it.
5,Great for me.,"These are truly amazing clippers. They fit my hands perfectly, which are a 'medium' sized depending on the glove type. They snip beautifully and are angled nicely too."
3,Fun movie,"Ejoyed it back in the '90's, and again in 2012. One of the rare times I enjoyed a movie better than a book."
4,A Fun Horror Film But Not Scarey,"This was and still is a fun film to watch with many friends and a supply of free flowing beer. This movie is eye candy for the horror film lover, but it really is more fun and a little gore than really scarey. Not for the children but the costumes are fun and the story is good as well. This is probably the best role Craig Schaffer has had yet an antihero who finds his place in the world only surrounded by a world of misfits. Don't expect much and you will be pleasantly surprised."
4,I wanted to see the sequel...,"But they never made it. If you are a Barker fan, then this is a must see. Despite it's summer film flavor, it has a very dark atmosphere and outlines a typically Barker-ish mythology."
2,Hellraiser it's not.,"I am a big fan of the Clive Barker novels and loved his film Hellraiser. That's why I gave Nightbreed a try, since it is based on his novel Cabal and he directed it himself. This proves that even the writer himself can have trouble putting his image of his novel on the big screen. It does portray an interesting story with some imaginative ""demons"" (even though most of them are corny at best), the film still comes out way to cheesy for my taste of horror films. Even more cheesy than Hellraiser III, with all those wierd ""new"" cenobites like camerahead. Sadly to say, I was disappointed with Nightbreed. With Barker at the helm, one would think it should've been great and refreshing. It's not. Does not come near the impact of Hellraiser and only slightly begins to tread the same grounds of that film.I still enjoyed Nightbreed, but it didn't impress me. Other Barker fans will probably like."
4,The Tribes of the Moon Embrace You!,"A great and criminally underrated film from the mind of Clive Barker (Hellraiser, Candyman.) While the theatrical cut is flawed and remains a cautionary tale about studio interference, It is still a solid film and worthy of greater popularity and a director's cut. The special features are pretty bare; just a trailer, some actor bios, and subtitle options. They could've thrown in a director's commentary at the very least, but then again this film was so botched and forgotten that I'm surprised it even made the format jump to DVD. That and the fact the film was initially 2 hours and 30 minutes and got cut down 1 hour and 40 minutes are the only reason I gave the DVD four stars instead of five."
5,"""...it's something...natural...""","You have no idea how great it was to finally see this spectacular movie come out on DVD. Clive Barker truly has done a terrific job once again. The only thing that disappoints me is the lack of extras. Personally, I would have liked to see more of history for the monsters individually. The porcuipine lady (I can't remember her name... something Suzi, I think), for example. She was my fave since I was a little kid. Another thing as a disappointment was there are no deleted scenes from the movie. The script contains many points, monsters, and backgrounds that the movie leaves out. I've given this movie 5 stars because it truly deserves it. It is an excellent production as a whole. But what would send it over the top would be the minor extras. Just as an example, if they went into as much detail with the monster's backgrounds as was done in ""13 Ghosts"", it would fuel the already blazing spectacle known as ""Nightbreed""."
3,please release a special edition,"I love this movie and were hanging to see it released on DVD thinking I could finally see the deleted scenes and deleted characters/monsters (Suzi Quatro in cut out completely). I have a book of the script which has pictures of many scenes not in the movie, for example, Babette has completely different make-up throughtout the movie, and a completely different ending where a cop that dies towards the end originally helped to save the 'breed (there is a photo of him at the end of the movie holding the different babette), plus the large amount of monsters I have photos of that aren't in the movie (eg. Mexico)Anyway, don't get me wrong, I'm real happy it was even relesed on DVD, just a shame, as there could have been so much more than the trailer and bios - what other movie is such an achievement in the make-up department epsecially with the hundreds of different monsters."
3,GOOD FILM BAD DVD,First off the extras? What extras? I have always liked this movie and jumped at the chance to own it on DVD but to find it in this condition is rather a shame. None of the deleted scenes are added or any extras of any kind really. Saying that if you have never seen it or are a fan of Clive Barkers other works it is still a worthy purchase. Particularly if you are a fan of the Hellraiser series you will enjoy it. It is rumoured that their will be a special directors cut released in the near future so if you can wait I would urge you to do that. Unless of course your a total Barker head like me and can't!
5,One of Clive barker's best,"I really enjoyed this film, but I'm biased because I'm a huge fan of director David Cronenberg who plays the evil Dr. Decker.I've been waiting for the rumored director's cut but none so far. it's not as dark as Lords Of Illusion, but every bit as good. The only disappointment? Decker was brought back to life at the end, how about a follow up on that?"
3,Still Heavy and Still Pretty Decent!,"Lee Aaron broke through with the Metal Queen release and this one continues in that vain. The style, sound, texture are pretty much intact from the Metal Queen sound or vibe.This collection of songs aren't quite as strong as the ones found on Metal Queen. The first 4 tunes are very good and the rest are just average really. I always loved the way Lee Aaron belted it out and this one does not disappoint when it comes to lung power. Just listen to Barely Holding On and you'll see just how versatile this singer really was. Anyway, it's a decent listen, probably a 3.7 out of 5 kind of deal.Pick it up!"
5,An excellent book.,"Judith R. Smith has obviously suffered through and broken free of abusive relationships. I was amazed at the accuracy of the descriptions of the abuser and his reaction to the abused breaking free. I was also impressed with the encouragement that was offered and the way it touched my heart and actually made me finally feel as if I was making the correct decision. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who has endured, or is currently in an abusive relationship."
2,DO NOT BUY!,"If you want a Chi hair dryer buy one from the store! I have used mine for 2 months and within the first month it started turning off when it got too hot (about 4 minutes of use) then it stopped working altogether! For such an expensive ""professional"" hairdryer this is unheard of. Do not buy! It's a rip off..you might as well pay an extra 40 dollars and get years of use out of it as opposed to 2 months!"
3,Hair dryer,Light and easy to use. Wish their was more volume when on HI. Next time would buy a blower with stronger output.
4,interesting book,"It helps me a lot with my ENG class study though some are hard to understandOverall, it is a good textbook"
3,sharp useful tools in an ugly plastic box,"if you're just looking for useful cutting tools, these will do nicely, but if you care about the container, you'll want to look elsewhere. At other stores, you may find a version of this kit housed in a cute wooden box; here, the container is a cheesy plastic in an ugly orange color, which I think is trying to imitate the look of wood. the overall effect is disappointing."
1,Not worth the money,This book was a huge waste of money. It was more like a glorified magazine than a book. It is not of the quality you expect from a book that Dr. Sears was associated with.
4,A Soundtrack with a relaxing and exciting score.,"After Listening to the soundtrack of Eragon you can't help but get lost in the beautiful and uplifting melodies of the composer's score. Most of the songs rhythms are soothing and inspiring. For instance, during some of the battle sequences and when Eragon and his pet dragon take to the air for the first time. But it's Avril Lavigne's new theme song to the film, ""Keep holding on"" and Jem's ""Onoe in Every Lifetime"" that truly sell the CD. The End credit theme song is the real reason why I bought the CD. Unlike Eragon, its predacesor ""Dragon Heart"" has more of an engaging orchestra score. In regards to the film itself the story behind it was quite weak and the end finale left me wanting more at the end. In closing ""Dragon Heart"" has a much deeper story, a very powerful message for all to share and a much more powerful dragon. No one does it better than Sean Connery who adds a very wise and honorable voice to his dragon character ""Drakco""."
5,Patrick Doyle is great!,"I never read Eragon and never saw the movie, but this soundtrack by Patrick Doyle is simply spectacular. I've liked his stuff ever since Henry V, but here Doyle has truly outdone himself."
2,Nothing I've not heard done better elsewhere,As stereotypical as you can get for a fantasy soundtrack. Derivative of countless other scores and after listening to it a few times nothing is sticking in my head in the least. The main theme is pedestrian. The main battle pieces are passable but nothing special. I'll be taking my copy to the used CD store.
2,Avril Fan,"I bought this CD for the Avril Lavigne song Keep Holding On. I really like her song, and this is the only way I could find to buy get it. Was to buy the Eragon Sound track. I havent seen the movie. Besides that I wouldn't have bought it."
4,Bobby Watson goes electric,"In this album Bobby Watson fronts a band that sports synthesizers and electric guitar. However, his long-time associate from Horizon, Victor Lewis is on board. It is different for Bobby, but still successful overall. Above all, the album has good compositions. Bobby also plays tenor on a couple of cuts which is different. The best songs are Lou B, Beatitudes, and Agaya. The keyboards are played very nicely by Rachel Z. There are a couple of vocals that are not successful. This music would not get airplay on the 'Smooth Jazz' stations even though it has the right instrumentation. This album still has a little grit to it. Quite nice."
4,best,this is one of the best books in english grammer that anyone may use to improve his english level. there is one problem that this book is printed without answers in the edition i have bought and until now i can't get the answers that i hardly study the book without it.
1,A reject from the bargain basement,"For more than 10 years ""Are You Being Served?"" followed the misadventures and schemes of the employees of Grace Brothers' a British Department store with everything from fire drills to foul weather, transit strikes to dissatisfied customers to out maneuvering the plans of management. The main characters became like well loved friends whose behavior you could rely on.That having been said, this item is a complete and utter waste of time and money. Listed as `the best of' it is little more than clip shows hosted by John Inman and Mollie Sugden, two of the long serving cast members as promotional tools for American PBS, the sort of thing broken up every 20 minutes with station heads begging to you send them money.Do not do it. Are you Being Served is timeless humor, especially if you've ever worked retail, but use your money to buy the actual episodes, especially the first 7 seasons. This is just a cheap ploy to grab money that can be better spent elsewhere."
2,Just biblical,Be aware that this book ONLY contains names found in the bible. It does have a scripture reference for each name and would make a great bible study tool. If you are looking for a broad spectrum of names this may not be the book for you.
2,Low-grade work of amateurs,"This video is clearly the low-grade work of amateurs. Crudely videotaped in 1981, this is the shopworn story of a ghetto youth who deals drugs and sees the error of his ways before it's too late. Horrible acting, unimaginative dialogue, and cellar-budgeted cimematography help to make this a very unremarkable expereince. However, the theme song ""Corner Boy"" (while repeated endlessly through this video) is quite catchy and you may hum it to yourself for a long time afterwards. Although the story has been told countless times before, it would be interesting to see how wayward teenagers today would respond to it."
2,Doesn't come with link spring,"I thought that this was a reasonable price for the bed especially with the free shipping. The problem is that it doesn't come with the link spring frame that the mattress sits on. The description says it does not include accessories or mattress. I thought accessories meant the bedding. I would never assume the frame wasn't included. They need to be more clear. To order that part, shipped to my area is $172.14. That makes the cost of the bed closer to $800. I think I could have found it cheaper elsewhere. Just do a search for Saigon Daybed on internet, other companies sell it.The only other thing is that the top piece on the back and the sides is wicker. It is pretty, but it looked like wood to me in the picture. I wondered where the wicker was!!"
5,"It's simple, you need this....","I like Regeneration of Self better but this is still a solid release. They are now a hardcore band, but before they were metalcore. This is definately a must for hardcore kids. I mean this is REAL hardcore. Bands like Minor Threat and Black Flag are NOT hardcore, they're straitedge!!! Few Left Standing is probably the BEST hardcore band on the planet! No joke, so you better get this CD if you know what's good for you. These guys would make Hatebreed hide under there beds."
2,Same old maxims,I looked forward to receiving this book but was sorely disappointed with what it delivered. I've had the same thoughts on employee recognition forever. There were no new ideas and very little specifics on improving recognition.It is set up in a format where you can have a daily reminder that employee recognition is good and that is the best part of the book.Definitely not a must have but a decent addition for your bookshelf.
5,Another of Evangelista's super works!,"The Art and Science of Fencing should be the first step for people interested in the topic, beginner, fencers and writers wanting a good feel for the subject. However, Evangelista builds on that solid foundation of the first book, by moving into the practical mentality needed to do well in the sport. This book is dedicated to excellence in form, technique, mindset and the fencer's élan. Evangelista gives such a rich in-depth look at the sport, how to succeed, how to adjusting your mind to winning.This a must for fencers looking to win and improve in all aspects of the sport."
2,Good points buried,"I believe Mr. Evangelista has some very good points in The Inner Game, electric scoring has diminished some aspects of the sport, many fencers often do think only of winning instead of how to fence properly, etc. However, these points are buried in the author's narcissistic commentary. Mr. Evangelista does not explore others' way of thinking. It seems he believes his ideas are the only ones worth printing. Surely, in a sport as complex as fencing, there is more than one way to achieve success. As a reader and fencer, I'd like to explore more than one option."
5,Budo from a western perspective,"I don't fence. I practice Asian martial arts.I've found the Inner Game of Fencing to be entirely appropriate for those of us interested in traditional Asian martial arts. Where Mr. Evangelista is coming from, what he hopes to accomplish, resonates entirely with our goals an aims in our practice.He's approached Budo from the West.I have recommended this book many times to my associates."
3,Too much of a polemic at times,"I'm a sport fencer, and I admire Mr. Evangelista's devotion to classical fencing. I enjoyed The Art and Science of Fencing and was amused and intrigued by Fighting with Sticks.However, I find that his expression of contempt for the modern sport smacks of sour grapes and distracts the reader from some of the other very useful content.To me, it seems that the only purpose of Mr. Evangelista's sweeping dismissal of modern fencing is to advance his theory that they are no longer related in any way (a thory to which many do not subscribe).He should have saved his vitriol for another book and just focussed on the fine insights he gives into the art and psychology of fencing."
5,A Great Book,"The Inner Game of Fencing is a very good book. It explains the hows and whys of fencing. There is also quite a bit of humor in the book, making it fun to read. Evangelista writes in a clear, understandable way."
2,interesting...,"Just an observation - a large proportion of the 5 star reviews come from Springfield where Nick happens to coach. Student loyalty is not surprising (even commendable), but something to consider when judging the impartiality of some reviews.Just to summarise - if you're a sport fencer don't bother, if you're a classical fencer it may be worth a read.I agree with statements about formatting - There may be 300 pages, but only about 100 of actual content and only about 20 of actual tactics."
5,"A Modern ""A BOOK OF FIVE RINGS""","""The Inner Game of Fencing"" is the book the great Japanese swordsman Miyamoto Musashi would have written had he been alive today. This book is the ""Spirit of Fencing."" Don't delay, buy this book. The fire burns here!"
5,Basie Big Band,"This album was released my senior year in high school. Every song is a winner and Basie and his band,some of the cats were quite old, swung with that big, fat, Basie sound. I went to a Basie concert, sat in the front row and dug this band live as it played every number from this album. The crowd went wild, the band was so cool and the Nestico tunes swung sooooooo well."
1,Very uncomfortable headset,"Very uncomfortable headset. Does not stay put. Sound quality was okay, but I still had to return this item. I fly the A320."
1,Don't waste your money,"I fly MD-80s for a major airline and bought this headset thinking it would suffice--it did not. It is a fine design and execution except for the microphone. The microphone portion is junk--the controllers couldn't understand me when I spoke. I believe the boom for the microphone is too short and if they had a longer boom, placing the microphone closer to the mouth, it may be fine but as it stands, it doesn't work well for speaking.I found that if I cupped my hand over my mouth to direct the sound to the microphone it was adequate but that gets annoying fast. I don't want to use two hands to speak on a headset, I only want to use one so the other is free to change the frequency or scratch an itch...I don't believe I purchased a defective unit, I believe Plantronics created an ineffective design. Until they extend the boom, avoid this headset."
1,Not worth it,This head set sounds great and the mic works well but does not stay put on ear. You have to keep fixing it.
3,"slim headsets, save space, good price and value","This set will work fine in Airbus 320 family because the cockpit is very silent. If your type and model isn't, move on.They are very slim and light and space convenient but are rather uncomfortable to ""wear"". The mic stays unpleasantly floating away from mouth. ATC reports good transmitting level though. They give the feel that they are always falling from your ear. They always feel loose. You get used to that feeling over time. Even thought they look very fancy, I use them only as back-up. I rather use the old-fashioned model of telex.Definitely, very good value for the money."
4,Light but not durable .,I bought it long time ago but did not last long .I do not recommend it if you are looking for a long term head set .I'm using clarity head set - one of the best -I'm flying A330-300 .
2,just okay,"I have naturally very dry curly frizzy hair, I purchased this for 1/4 the price on amazon so Im glad I did not spend alot with the conditioner shampoo and deep treat. I really like the deep treat but the shampoo and conditioner is just eh my hair is much more tangled after getting out of the shower then it ever has with a name brand product. My hair feels alot dryer so I have to use the deep treat every time I use the shampoo and conditioner. I won't purchase again"
2,An unsuccessful attempt at a lightweight big blade.,"Though I didn't expect much it was still a disappointment to see a ""Buck"" blade of this quality. The handle of the knife is constructed entirely of a lightweight plastic, no metal liners or frame. Wonderful for stripping off a few ounces, but compromises the integrity of the entire knife.It's most evident weakness is it's inability to handle any kind of lateral force on the blade. Just a small amount of pressure on either flat of the blade causes a noticeable and disconcerting flex in the knife.As for the blade material, it's decent though relatively soft for ""high carbon"". The Bantam sharpens well enough, though doesn't stay shaving sharp for long. The blade is pretty thick, too thick to use for cleaning game or fish.For the price it's an alright knife. The Large Bantam is definitely up to opening boxes and envelopes, but unable to perform at the tasks I typically carry a large knife for."
5,Looks great- good value,"This is a good looking knife that is not too big or too little. It is quite possible to open this knife one handed using the thumb stud, it just isn't all that fast a process (about as fast as opening a standard pocket knife with two hands). Much smaller than my Gerber knife with nearly the same blade length. I got this for light duty camping work and it works fine for that. Haven't decided if I like the clip on the handle yet (I might take it off)."
3,Unbalanced w/ too much plastic,"Buck has a great reputation for knives, too bad this Bantam doesn't live up to it. The blade itself is okay with a nice finish, decent edge, and US made. The handle is another story. It's all plastic. Being that the handle is all plastic it throws the balance off on the knife. It just doesn't feel right in the hand when the blade end wants to continually drop.The blade lock works, but is too loose and can cause the blade to drop on your fingers.I expected better from Buck."
2,"Timely delivery, but missing parts.","The two kits I ordered came with some fairly inventively wrapped cardboard, but within three days.One of the kits was incomplete, however, missing one of the three sets of ears used for two-post rack configuration. I'm not pleased at being shipped incomplete product."
4,clunky but workable,"It still irks me that my tanks can be fended off by phalanxes in cities, but it has decent graphics for a civ game. The thing that I like most about it is that it goes into the future and creates a whole history of the future. Thats why I still prefer this game over civ3. Where civ 3 ends u still have a whole millina to discover new and intresting technologies to pursue. Civ 3 should definately take all its improvements but change the timeline for their next game"
3,They took functions out of the game to add graphics,"Well, if you've never played Civilization before, you might like it. For the gamers, collectors, and followers maybe buy it and stuff it in a corner. The settlers don't improve the terrain, the units are not supported by individual towns, and on and on. I just can't think what happened here? Did someone else get a cheap contract on the rights? Where is the game? Cinamatics are blurry...ah it is hard to bad mouth what use to be a good game, but like everyone else has already said, ""Skip this one."" And, get the name of that truck. What happened?"
1,IT SUCKS BIG TIME,"I didn't like it. It was too hard to understand, it was boring, and I just all out hated it.Play something else, that's exactly what I did!"
1,So Many Things Wrong...,"... it's hard to know where to begin - Map Generator is awful, AI is stupid (at the beginner level), next level up is ""impossible"" - Game DRAGS - A MASSIVE disappointment - stick with CIV III -"
4,One of the srategy GREATS,"For those of you that have never played a Civilization game, it is a strategy game in which you start off controlling only a simple band of settlers. As the game progresses, you choose places to build your cities, what is built in each of them, your type of government, and your foreign policy. Of course, you're not going to start off in modern times (unless you use an editor), so you have to decide where to guide your resources: should you jump head-first into the scientific stream, leaving yourself open for attack, ignore science and dominate the world with an iron fist, act as passive traders with other nations, or anything your heart may desire. Ultimately, you end up forging the history of your people; it's up to you if they emerge victorious, or disappear in the chaos of time."
3,Deep yet impenetrable,"I just bought this game a couple of days ago..I'm still trying to get through the tutorial. Apparently there is no way to get past level 2, as you are not allowed to progress until you've completed the step that is prompted by the tutorial. In my case, I have repeated the same step over and over and over, but I guess it must be a glitch in the game or something, as it won't go past this step. The interface is absolutely impossible to figure out, even with the Tutorial. Anyway, this could have been a great game, as it contains massive info about history and civilizations, etc. which is more interesting than anything I ever studied in a history class, but playable? I don't know."
2,"Clunky, badly-done.","It's a sad comment when a classic game is succeeded, several generations later, by a 'sequel' that is considerably harder to play and much more annoying in interface and controls. Don't buy this. Please, don't subject yourself to it. Buy Civ2 - which is similar to this, only not broken and far less annoying. Buy Civ3. Buy Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri. But don't buy this. The pathing is a pain, you can't get to the controls for your cities or your units, and it's just generally one of the few games I ripped out of my CD drive and threw against the wall in pure frustration."
1,Not what I ordered,"This is not Civilization Call to Power. This is CTP II. I wanted CTP (original) because is allowed you to operate in space and build flying storm troopers. This version has done away with those types of advances. I was very disappointed because I had search long and hard for a vender that was selling the original CTP. This vendor claimed to, and the picture shows the original, but the original is not what I received!!!"
5,Don't analysize this...,"This movie was hilarious. You have to have an appreciation for slapstick tongue in cheek humor to truly be about to enjoy this film. They are funny young men just having a good time and poking fun at absolutely everything from religion to stardom.Sit down, kick back and laugh for awhile."
1,Non-Compatible,Chances are very good that this will NOT be compatible with your DVD player. I tried it in two machines with no success. Buyer beware!
5,No reason not to get this version.,"Yeah, I know. There are a lot of marginal-quality, semi-official DVDs of Beatles films out there <cough>MagicalMysteryTour<cough>...but this one doesn't fall into that category.Picture-wise, it's crisp, with minimal noise (just a VERY RARE bit of film dust on occasion). The sound is excellent, too. Not muddy, perfectly synced, etc. It's a full-frame presentation, but I think the US release from the late '90s was, too. The only odd thing is that NOWHERE on the disc or case is the name of the movie printed in English. Oh, and the photo used for the cover of this 1965 film is, inexplicably, from 1967.But until MPI gets their act together and re-issues ""Help!"" in the US, this Korean version is a fantastic substitute for about a tenth of the price that the rip-off sellers are asking for."
5,Excellent quality dvd. Don't pay big bucks for the MPI version.,"I just got a copy of this S. Korean dvd of ""Help"" and it's great. Print quality is excellent and the dvd plays perfectly. Why pay over $100 for the oop MPI release when this is every bit is good, and just as good as the Criterion laser release from years ago. Even has the original theatrical trailer, and I got my copy for ten bucks, delivered, all the way from S. Korea. So what if there's Korean writing on the cover? Highly recommended."
5,Amazed at the Quality of the Transfer,"I watched this on my brother's monster HD WEGA and I was back to those Saturday afternoons when Help! would come on back to back with Yellow Submarine or maybe a Hard Day's Night. I always thought the Beatles movies pioneered music videos before there were any. I couldn't believe how crisp the film transfer was since I'd already seen other movies made much later that looked like crap on HD. I would love for an affordable American release, of Help! but this one's plenty satisfactory for me. Rave!"
5,Great Grammar Reference Book,This is an excellent book to use as a reference for Hindi grammar. It would be more useful if it came with a cassette in order to see how the letters and words are pronounced. A bonus is the use of the devanagari script throughout the book. Probably the best Hindi language book available.
3,German is a little lacking,"I bought this card primarily for German, but was disappointed to find out that the German words are not listed with their gender. All German words have a gender (masculine, feminine and neuter) and you need to know the gender in order to use the proper article. In German the article is pretty important for effective communication. Other than that, the quantity of words and useful phrases is pretty good. I also like the functionality and navigability of the software."
2,Better products available on software,"The content is not bad for this add-on card, but there are a lot of better alternatives out there. My favorite is Qvadis Lexica, for example, which has available translation options between English and Spanish, French, German, Italian and Portuguese. The Qvadis user interface is superior, and you can add your own words and edit definitions on the go. It is software, not an SD card, but a better buy, in my opinion. This is the kind of program Palm should have included in this PalmPak card."
5,Crazy Love,The finest in Swedish indie pop! Great songs with the special touch of a Karin's fragile voice. A must buy if You like pop with a twist.
1,Blow by blow narration of just about everything except campground hosting.,"I wanted to like this, I really did.How many books do you find out there dedicated just to campground hosting?What the book ended up being about was the authors, their life, squabbles with the neighbors...etc.And minor incidentals about their experiences as campground hosts.It got so bad..I couldn't even get more than half way before skimming the rest.I don't think I have ever seen a book where an author mentions their own name so many times.This IS NOT a guide for people wanting info on Campground Hosting.According to the authorThe Gist: Have an expensive looking rig in excellent condition if you expect to get this volunteer jobDress for success...slobs don't bother to apply.On an on why they are better than the average bear...Yet another middle aged elitist entry into the full-timer market....UGH"
5,Wonderful book about a girl in my hometown.,"This book is great reading for children 6-10 years old. It's really funny. I also love the fact that it mentions Belington, West Virginia...my hometown."
1,The Worst!,This book is totally boring. I didn't like it. Most of the reviews I have written are possative but this one is a negative.
3,basic kit,"This fullfilled what I wanted; some materials and experients for a Destination Imagination project on color, shadow, and light.The contents were rather simple, some color filters, tiny mirrors, book of experiements, etc.. The package is small.This wouldn't be for someone not ""interested"" in science, or doesn't need a spingboard to learn this material."
1,Useless,I foudn the book compleely useless and a waste of money. It explains nothing. After studying this book for two hours I was unable to do anything whatsoever in Excel. Look elsewhere.
3,Gentle intro but no depth,"This is a good book for a non stressfull introduction, but there are few good hands on examples. I've found that by doing complex detailed step by step examples you can learn more faster. The learnkey.com website has a good excel class"
2,Good for Just Basics,"This book is fine if all you want to do is basic spreadsheets. If cutting, pasting, basic formatting, or creating VERY simple formulas is all you need to do then this book is fine. However, if you are trying to do anything more complicated forget using this book. For instance, the section on creating Macros wasn't very detailed. In addition, the book is completely missing any explanation of how to use the more complicated formula functions (there is no mention of how to do any of the statistical functions). Probably 80% of what an average user needs is in this book. But for anything beyond the basics, forget it; you'll need another reference."
5,Don't lose the spring or your up the creek,I thought buying a second spool would save time. Spool and string were fine. nothing unique. However in changing the beast the pop-up spring got lost. The $1.50 spring took three weeks to find a supplier and replace. Spray the assembly with WD40 for easy operation.
5,Great Product!,"I'm still learning all of the neat functions that this flash has, but I am really enjoying it so far."
4,Works like a charm,I take two capsules each morning and since doing so no longer suffer from hot flashes or night sweats. I have set up a subscription to purchase this product so I never run out.
3,God and Me,I would have liked to have known how many pages had writing on them. There were many I had to white out.
5,daughter loves it,My daughter is really into this book- she loves the activities as well as the devotions- great book!
4,A wealth of theological information in an erudite form.,"Dr. Cairns' dictionary of theological terms gives the reader clearly-focused snapshots of many complex theological terms in an extremely readable format. He is succint but with enough detail to give the reader a nice overview of the terms he defines. It has earned a place on my bookshelf alongside books on systematic and bibilical theology. It is a nice bridge between these two theological disciplines.Dr. Brian M. Kelly, Assistant Pastor, Hamilton Square Baptist Church"
4,"yes, but what does it sound like???????",I'd like to buy this but I would like to hear some 30 second samples first! Unavailable from other vendors.
5,My daughter's favorite book,This is the only book my daughter wants us to read to her. She loves hearing all the sounds and then making them herself. I HIGHLY recommend this book!
3,An interesting plot,"In his second novel, Tigner tells an interesting tale centered around a young woman who makes friends with some very strange, but interesting, bedfellows - including an old trucker who lives in a park and a former kootch dancer who lives in a castle. Her journey from California to Texas to find her grandmother is intertwined with surprises. The author's rather simple but sincere treatment of an extrodinary plot gives the story verisimilitude. This is a refreshing story that keeps the reader turning pages."
4,I Like This One!,To me it tastes exactly like cookie dough when it's diluted properly. After this bottle is empty I'll order another one.
2,Not what I hoped for,I read a lot of really good reviews about this book before ordering it. Then I read it and I was left wondering if I had ordered the right book. Cline distances herself from readers as much as the characters in the novel distance themselves from each other. Not only was the story underwhelming but the characters were completely flat.
1,Overrated,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this book came highly recommended but proved to be a real disappointment. I didn't find the characters interesting or compelling, and I'm not even really sure there was a plot. More just a series of events which lacked climax. It is broken into three chronological ""acts"" but relies too heavily on flashbacks to seal the gaps between.The editing is also poor; the main character is twelve in 1976 but is something like 32 in 1990. The writing is uninspired and resorts to telling the reader what she is supposed to feel. The dialogue is unbelievable and often doesn't fit the character.There was one section of the book in the middle that seemed more carefully written and almost captured my imagination, but even that failed in the end.I could go on, but I will stop at saying that I am not inspired to read any more books from 2004 if this is ""one of the best"" of the year."
3,Just OK,"I'm the first person to admit that I read a lot of ""chick books"", in among the other genres I enjoy. And this seemed like standard chick-book fare -- divorce, hints at borderline sexual abuse, a problematic relationship between a girl/woman and her mother, the death of a substitute mother, the adoption of her teenaged son -- with a few twists, but it was told in such a cumbersome way that at times I had a hard time getting through it. The prose simply didn't flow well for me. However, for what it is, it was worth reading once, and I did enjoy some aspects of it."
3,Overrated,"This book was okay, but I am surprised that it is on any list of ""best books."" Okay, one thing that irritated me was that the cover has nothing to do with the story. I also thought the characterizations were rather glib and the writing less than pristine. A beach book; nothing I would consider reading again."
3,Mixed review,"I've just scanned the reviews and see that several feel the same way that I do about this book. I have a mixed review for RC's book. I was somewhat disappointed with this book due to the lack of character development in the early part of the book. I had questions about the characters that she simply left unexplored or at the very least unanswered.The story telling was lacking in certain points and made me wonder if the editing staff had deleted too much?!The last few chapters were redeeming, when the writing became better and she explained more. Did she intentionally do this? Just as Denny (Eden) is becoming comfortable in her own skin and is finally ""grown up"" the book is better? Is this a coincidence?The last sections exhibited strong storytelling and a certain truthfulness that I appreciated.I hesistate suggesting this book to others to read, unless they understand that at times you'll be frustrated with the writing/plot/storytelling."
1,Just Blah,"I just want to warn those we think this is going to be a good book, I just could not get into the characters or where the novel was going....I tried, but put it down, good luck"
2,Disappointing,"I read the reviews posted by others prior to ordering this book and I took it on vacation. I thought I would have a quick satisfying read. Instead, I was so disappointed with the book, especially the ending, that I began reading Old School by Tobias Wolfe immediately in order to feel that I got one good read in on vacation. What to Keep was a waste of my time. If you want a good read...Old School by Tobias Wolfe is a much better choice."
2,Striving,I could not get into this book at all. It seems like the writer is trying too hard to set a mood but not giving us enough of the characters. I had a hard time plodding through the entire story.
3,Quick read full of human emotion,"Rachel Cline weaves a beautiful story out of three snapshots of the main character's life, spanning three decades. Cline manages to cover a lot of time in this short book, yet the scenes are vivid and detailed; nothing is skimmed over. I felt really close to Denny as I saw her in the different phases of her life.This book really hits home on the theme of parenting. Denny has a surrogate parent who affects her in each of the three life periods. Denny, her friend Maureen, and another character are all children who grow up in a house without a father, and there are parallels between all of their lives. We see Denny go from a child with somewhat absent parents to the age where she considers becoming a parent herself, and the transformation makes for great reading."
3,Tried in my Panasonic AG-AC130 - it worked,It worked but I returned it after a week of use because the 2 connector jack keeps popping out. The right angle connectors have stiff wires and uneven length into the y-junction making it difficult to redirect into the controller. This could have been a better product if the wires are like the telephone cord.
4,Great piece of equipment!,"I've been using this controller for a few weeks now, and absolutely love it. It's small, yet precise design makes for a great piece of equipment to have for all kinds of shooting."
3,Very rudimentry,"This book can be valuable to those who never did well in grammar school and high school arithmetic or to those whose rudimentry math is extremely rusty. The book covers the simplest portion of GMAT quant section(fractons, decimals, percents). As its name implies, this book covers mostly rudimentry arithmetic which is sure to bore many GMAT takers.I have found only 7 questions which I personally found somewhat challenging. Worse yet, the real GMAT questions are signficantly (but not substantially) more difficult than the questions presented in this book.Still, this book provides valuable review of arithmetic. I was going to grant this book 4 stars but the explanation of the answers were really dumbed down to those who would have trouble with rudimentry arithmatic. Given that I could solve most of the problems in this book in my head, I have found book's advocacy of grids to solve basic arithmatic problems to be counterproductive."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I have an engineering background and I strongly suggest others with a similar one not to buy this book. I could complete this book and all of its 'exercises' in an hour. All it does is repeats very basic math knowledge which I bet you will not forget even after 50 years from now. All in all bad book for GMAT Fractions, Decimals, & Percents preparation. Now I have look for ways to sell this book which I bought two days ago... any buyers? not a scratch on the paper and is all in mint condition."
5,The Lord's Prayer,I cannot say enough about this book and how it has opened my eyes and heart to the value of the example of prayer that Jesus gave His disciples. Dr. Towns breaks down each phrase of the prayer and gives an in-depth look at each one in relation to God and ourselves. Very much worth a read!
5,The seller is great.,The lightbulbs were right on time and should work beautifully in the rustic light fixture I needed them for. Thanks.
4,Mrs Sermon?,"As another reviewer put it--not PC. It's very much patriarchal, which reduced my appreciation of it. What I'd like to see is the same events as seen by Mrs Sermon. I hope someone will write such a book."
4,"Good, Solid, Airplane Disaster Movie","The plot is simple. A disgruntled ex-husband sabotages a plane his ex-wife and new husband are on as if to say ""If I can't have her, no one will"" with a bio-chemical bomb he placed on board. Good, tense, solid airplane disaster movie that somewhat shadows the 1966 TV-Movie ""Doomsday Flight"" with real hard edge-of-your-seat suspense. A fine addition to the ""library"" of airplane disaster movies. Don't miss this one!!"
1,Size is incorrectly represented,"The shelves are listed to be 13 & 1/4"" long. HOWEVER, they flare to13 & 1/2"" from back to front. It will not fit into my medicine cabinet.The seller is reluctant to take item back. (Even though they measured whileI was on the phone and found my claim to be true.) Unfortunately, thereappear to be no other options on AMAZON.COM."
1,"Incorrect size, sloppy packing","I agree 100% with other review stating... ""The shelves are listed to be 13 & 1/4"" long. HOWEVER, they flare to 13 & 1/2"" from back to front.""I saw that review and took a chance in case the vendor fixed the problem from July... NOPE.Still incorrectly sized and won't fit in my medicine cabinet: 13.25"" wide. Maybe if you have a dremel tool or something you can trim/file the ends down with it could work.Shipped in a cardboard box with some token pieces of brown paper... box arrived crushed but item was undamaged. Wish it had chipped the front corner about quarter of an inch."
2,"average product, need to live with it","I agree with other reviewers about the sizing. it's also not the best quality, and priced quite expensive.But this was the only shop selling just medicine cabinets in the world it seems to me. I had option to either buy an entire cabinet, get labor charge to remove old one and install or go with this.I somehow pushed them in and made it work.for now I am good, but they are already sagging, and looks like the time to do the entire cabinet replacement is nearing."
2,Shabby product,I was under the impression that I was receiving metal shelves. Instead I received shelves that were not as wide as my cabinet and out of limsy plastic. When I put a can of hair spray on the shelf it bowed immediately. I was trying to get rid of the bow not get the same result.Jensen Industries Incorporated Medicine Cabinet Shelf
1,Oh Well...,"This mistake cost me a total of $13.32. I am chalking it up to experience. The shelf is too wide to fit into my medicine cabinet. Even if it had fit, it is only about 2/3 the depth of my old shelf. Soooooo...with a little ingenuity and a tube of Ducocement, I am repairing the old shelf. I took a chance and lost. I will be tossing this shelf in the garbage."
4,Worked fine,The Medicine cabinet shelves worked fine for us. Our cabinets were Jensen and the prior owners removed them before vacating.
4,Higher Circles one of prog rock/rock's better bands!,"I am impressed with the musicianship and songwriting of this band- as another review said, they take obvious influences of Rush, Yes, Dream Theater, and create their own unique blend of beauty and bits of darkness and even mystery- The lyrics are awesome, the artwork is phenomenal, now I am just waiting for the tour!"
4,where do you play?,"Thanks guys, this is a great album. Sorry its only 4, i never give out 5's or you would have gotten one. But really, this thing is great. Good mix of mood and story of a Floyd album with the style and strength of Queensryche. And yes, a little Dream Theatre electronica in there to, but you managed to tie it all up with your own flow. fantastic instrumental work. I like to see new bands that clearly know how to do things right, and yet have thier own stuff they want to play around with. The only gripe i have is that i cant seem to find you guys. are you playing anywhere? if so please post it on your web site, i can imagine a show would be awesome, if you didnt screw it up like most bands do at least.-EarthManJim"
4,"The ""Gray Lions"" Don't Dissappoint","Many of the recordings featuring aging jazz musicians are dissapointing because the players are naturally facing dimished capacity. But not this one. Recorded in 1986 when most of the headliners here - Edison, Peterson, Vinson and Joe Pass on guitar (who for some reason fails share the top billing) - were in their 60's or 70's, this Pablo (ie. Norman Granz) session is tight, well conceived and swings with abandon. Everyone sounds great, no stragglers. It's just amazing. There are two medium tempo pieces (Stuffy and Satin Doll), two barn burners (This One's for Jaws and Broadway), two ballads (Everything Happens to Me and What's New) and a slow blues (Slooow Drag). Nice mix. If you like small group swing and blues executed by some of the legends of the swing era, this one's highly recommended."
5,"Accessible, authentic, entrancing","In 1986, when I was a folk/rockabilly type migrating to blues, and the sort who fancied it needful to ""keep up with the latest,"" I'd buy a dozen CDs or so a month. One night, I walked into Tower Records and heard this album playing. Like nothing I'd heard before. I sat on the stairs between floors to listen, found the guy in the booth to learn the name, and bought it. I have loved it ever since.This album started a drastic change my whole orientation to music. So much more sophisticated, witty, and wise than what I'd been playing for years.This is a fine intro to bluesy, sophisticated jazz. Listen to this, and you'll understand why jazz lovers detest so much of the bland ersatz music passing as ""smooth"" jazz. This is how it's 'sposed to be."
5,One of the best trios I've ever heard,"I completely loved this album. Oscar Peterson is absolutely magnificent, and his solos send chills down your spine. There also was great performances by Harry Edison & Cleanhead Vinson. I especially enjoyed the song broadway. Its up beat tempo and great improvisation alone is a good enough reason to buy this CD. I recommend this CD; I am confident that whomever listens to this CD will, if not already, become a life long fan of Oscar Peterson"
2,Not really worth it,"In my opinion, this book just says what everyone pretty much knows already. Don't take their things without asking, talk things out, etc. It's all pretty much common sense. For a better college advice book, I recommend College Survival or The College Woman's Handbook, in which both have chapters on roommates."
5,AC Delco Rotor,This brake rotor is the exact replacement of the OEM rotors that came on the car! Shipping was as discribed and I am very pleased.
5,Swedish pop music at its best,"Hkan Hellström has made a wonderful album. His music feels new and the lyrics (in Swedish) are both sensitive, serious, mad and funny. A good buy for anyone who likes alternative pop music."
2,Boring....,"This book might be titled, ""American Politics and the History of Certain Magazines."" Reading this book brought me to new levels of ennui."
1,Tighten the Beltway,"I had to read this book for a class and I must say, Dionne is stuck in this terrible world of Washington, D.C. Mr. Dionne, there is life outside the Beltway and that is where real politics happens. His columns in the Washington Post aren't much better, and I don't recommend anyone spending one red cent on this piece of hot air."
2,Wake me up when its over...........,This book was to be read for a political science class I am taking and if I would have known before hand I honestly would have dropped the class. The book is a great thing to get if you have a unbalanced chair and need to prop a leg to make it more balanced. That is about it. Thanks
4,just ever so slightly an offbeat sicilian,I noticed some articles on Grivas sicilians in 'New in Chess Yearbooks' 78 and 80 and decided to go to straight to the source and buy his book.Grivas' annotated games are excellent and his commentary is lucid and honest. At times I had a sense of deja-vu that I'd been in some similar positions before when playing scheveningens and Benko sozins.The opening won't guarantee a win but the idea is that you know the themes better than your opponent.In ICC play facing a white charge in an opposite side castling line proved a test of resilience. My only disappointments were with some of my opponents who went for the early exchange (1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Qb6 5.Nxc6?!)The Grivas sicilian is easy to learn and fun to play. I recommend the book.
4,"Original work, somewhat suspect opening","I enjoyed Mr Grivas' work - particularly as a fellow Greek! The book is very well researched. I think the main value lies with some of the sidelines as well as a surprise weapon. IMO the main line is very pleasant for White, as his plan develops by itself while Black is very close to the edge on several variations. I know that the name (Grivas Sicilian) has created some controversy - unjustified in my opinion. I think the different variation names, however, are a bit too much..."
1,Stay well away,If I want to learn some new software fast I always start with a Dummies book. Big mistake with this one. Took about 30% longer to read than it should have due to all the drivel he throws in - most of it totally unconnected with the topic.Get something else.
1,Real Weak!,"I had a problem with an SQL query involving joins. According to the index for this book, this book doesn't even cover joins! I about talked myself into believing that Access doesn't support joins, but Access' online help does explain using wizzards to do joins (which this book does not even mention). I needed to do my work in SQL, so the on line help didn't give me an answer, just encouragement. Finally I discoved that I had used a two-word field name, which Access supports, but which SQL does not. When I changed the field name to one word, the SQL query worked perfectly.I buy these books as resources to allow me to avoid spending an entire day with a simple syntax problem like this. ""Access 2000 for Dummies"" failed miserably in it's mission. (And it's not as funny as Kaulfield thinks it is, either...)."
3,Not enough info...,"I bought this book about a couple of months ago and I need an easier way to do my reports and faster. They did not show anything until I went online and found ""parameters"", did not have anything about ""parameters"", in the book. Book is good for basic use."
2,"too much cute fluff, too little substance","My opinion is based only on shopping for Access 2000 books in a bookstore. I found the cute little jokes annoying, and the text has a lot of fluff. I like a concise book (I bought Access 2000 for Windows Visual Quickstart Guide by Deborah and Eric Ray) so I can find what I need quickly.Still, as I browsed the table of contents, and read thru one of the sections of interest, the information was there. It just took too long to wade thru the fluff to get what I wanted."
2,Not worth it,"...My user level: beginner to intermediate (I already know how to build basic tables, forms, queries, trying to step up into the world of more complex relationships, reports, etc). I was pretty disappointed with this book: cut out the ""for dummies"" fluff and what's left are simple instructions on how to use the built in wizards. When I looked for example, for information on form controls in the index, I found they weren't even referenced. The front cover ""cheat sheet"" is just a listing of telephone and online tech support phone numbers (which you will end up shelling out $$ to call) and web addresses.Kaufeld spends way too much time trying to make jokiness look like friendly instruction. Then, in place of real instruction, he constantly tells users to go get help from their company tech guy/gal. Wait a minute - I thought I bought this book so I could learn on my own! Apparently, he didn't envision Access users who work outside of a large corporation with an IT department."
1,"Why make up words, use ASL","I prefer Joseph Garcia's set. I originally got this book as a gift because family knew I had been teaching my kids Sign. Great stuff, makes for very happy babies that can communicate their needs ( milk, eat, water, change, dog, hear, airplane, help, want, book, etc.) and just ""talk"" by 10 months old. But, when I got this book, I found it useless, with suggestions of ""made up signs"". Why not actually teach a second language? Often, I had adults who knew sign approach us and start signing with the babies, how happy and confident my babies looked then! I'd recommend getting Joseph Garcia's set plus a good Signing dictionary, like a pocket one, (for when that one year old wants to know what everything is, in sign) or Joy of Signing."
3,"Thank you, reviewers (and Amazon)","This isn't so much a review as a heartfelt thanks to the earlier reviewers who explained about having to put the router's MAC address in as bridging information (we had put in the address of the repeater instead). I had spent ages trying to figure out how to get the set-up to work and this is the only place I found the information I needed.As regards the device, it seems to work fine but the set-up instructions for extending the network could be clearer!"
2,Won't Bridge!,"I bought this AP to bridge to the Belkin Pre N router which I like alot. It didn't work! After an hour trying to set it up with no sucess, I read the fine print in the manual which says it only bridges to another F5D7130 and an older Belkin router. It's worthless to me. Back it goes!"
3,Disappointed.,"This is chock full of errors ! I find it hard to believe that I can go back to the EXAM PREP on Windows 2000 Professional by the same authors and find the material there is correct ! Since this is mostly a copy, with updates for the new features, it appears it must have been rushed out the door as they went out of business. What a shame, as the presentation, questions and projects are in a fine format."
4,Great album!,I have the CD and love the song Crooked Letter Hospitality! But then I also love Mississippi! Thanks - keep up the good work. I'm ordering two more Cd's to share with friends and family
3,Could've been better,"Maybe I've bought a watch after a long time, but the setting of month and date is a bit cumbersome.But I love the watch ! Its nice and elegant and goes with everything.Go and try it in your local Macys so you get the feel of it.Skagen has many similarly looking watches from Skagen, I just think this one suited me most.Its funny how the model sounds - 331 XL Sexy (another reason I bought it, who knows !) 8-)"
4,A meditation on catastrophe and history,"Slavitt's book is both a translation of the Biblical text and an extended meditation on Tish'a b'Av, the Jewish day commemorating a long series of losses and destructions. For those outside as well as within Jewish tradition, and interested in mourning and bereavement, this is fascinating material. It is beautifully written, and although it does not work as ""consolation"" literature, it places personal sorrows in a wider context. In the debate - within and outside Judaism - over whether the Holocaust was unique and if so, how, this book represents the negative stance. Jews had many many occasions of religious and historical catastrophe to cope with. This is a different point of view than, say, ""Strange Fire: Reading the Bible After the Holocaust"" edited by Linafelt, but both books are really worth delving into."
5,I'm not alone.,A mind provoking commentary on the standards and lack thereof at work in our present goverment and across the country in general. Stirring and soothing in that one feels less isolated with their thoughts that something is truly amiss in our nation. The effects of the extreme right wing relgious advocates and the reality of their beliefs as it affects Americans and the nation as a whole. Provides many hours of contemplative ruminations.
5,"a must read for anyone who doesn't want a ""W"" repeat","This book, in no uncertain terms, tells it like it is about the GOP and the Christian ""Right"". Mr Meyers describes, in detail, how the mixing of politics and religion has led to many of the problems we have today, including ""W"". It is a must read for anyone who doesn't want another ""W"" like leader in 08. They have distorted the Christian message from ""What would Jesus do?"" to ""Who would Jesus bomb"" and offers a message of acceptance and inclusion of all, even non-believers"", to make a better world. Offers many valuable points (about the environment, the poor, health care, and others, who the so called ""Christian"" people have twisted [in an ""unholy"" alliance with the GOP] which has nothing to do with the messages of the Gospels). Of course, the holier than thou will think it's ""blasphemy"", but these are the same people who talk out of both sides of their mouths. Judge for yourself."
5,Why the Christian Right is Wrong,"This is the clearest, most articulate book I have read in a long time. Robin Meyers, a Minister, nails the inconsistencies and just plain mean spiritness of those who profess to call themselves the followers of the Prince of Peace, inclusiveness, love and tolerance."
1,Why Meyers does not have a clue,"I have never read a book that blatantly twists Scripture. Meyers suggests that Paul is a homosexual, among a host of other errors. Has this guy ever picked up a Bible? If you support gay-affirming churches, moral relativism , and the suggestion that the Bible's rules do not really apply to life today, well this is your book. If you believe God left an infallible Word for His people, steer clear of this nonsense. I read 3/4th's of it and will be returning it tomorrow. I would be ashamed to have this blasphemy on my book shelf."
3,Movie with different names!,Be careful to look at the actors. This is listed as Holiday Affair as well. I have 3 of the same movie but different titles.
4,A good Read,"This book is fun to read, it tells you all you would want to know about the serie B. If you are a soccer lover you will appreciate this book more than anyone else. But, even if you're not you can still apreciate his humorous writing and insights into the Italian way of life. A good read, if you like soccer read this book."
4,"good robe, not very fluffy though","I got this since my puppy grew much bigger than expected. It works just fine. Isn't as soft and fluffy as I'd like though, more like a cotton towel."
1,"DO NOT BUY ~ Shadow Casting: The Making of ""A River Runs Through It",I AM A MARKETPLACE SELLER. I purchased several dozen copies of this DVD for resale last year for $2.00 each at my local Kroger store. This movie is nothing but a headache. It is a LOW QUALITY budget film that half the time doesn't work. I have had more negative feedback from this title than any product I have ever sold... and I didn't even make the darn thing. I have urged my customers to review the product HERE. Rating a seller for a poor product that they did not make does not help future customers... only a product review like this one. So PLEASE make sure you write a review if you don't like this film. As for the 20 or so copies I have left... donation to a thrift store. Bye Bye.
1,Not what I expected,I received this for Fathers Day and as soon as you lay in it the frame begins to sag until the hammock is scraping the ground. I only weight 180lbs. And the pillow doesn't hold air for more than a minute.
1,Hitting Bottom,"Product appears to be well made, but the canvas hammock must stretch in a brief period of time and your rear end will soon be on the ground (I weigh 180). Manufacturer replaced one hammock at no charge. The second unit did the same thing within a couple of days. Fail."
1,....be forewarned,"...you'll be spinning in seconds, the canvas is stretched too tight leading to horrible results. Another non-quality product made in China."
4,Very. very good book. Would be a great one if....,"This book is an amazing resource in to not only getting an idea of where clients may be in regards to symptoms but also, it offers an immense amount of ideas for treatment plans and goals. One problem is the authors do not go into detail about subscales on several tools that have them. Its still a great buy and i reccomend it to any MSW ."
5,Coach Quotes book,"I love this book. I scrapbook my sons' and husband's baseball activities, and will use this book repeatedly to add a nice touch to their baseball pages. There are great quotes in here for players and coaches alike."
4,A MUST HAVE,"I have an earlier book written by this author entitled, ""Activity-based Cost Management, Making It Work"" that was written during earlier days of implementing activity-based costing. Cokins' new book, while it addresses activity-based functionality for government, also presents some ""matured"" thinking and advice on ABC/M which I found to be extremely helpful in validating some of my own observations and learnings from implementing ABC/M. For a newcomer to ABC/M, the book presents the case for why government entities can profit from using ABC/M, how to get an implementation going, critical factors for success and some case studies of actual government implementations. But, it also gets into more advanced applications such as using ABC/M to support performance measurement, supply chain management, and budgeting. These chapters are not as easily digested, but they are a rich source of reference for those planning to broaden the use of activity-based cost/management."
3,Mixed bag,"The first few cuts are real funky R&B, exactly what the title -- and cover -- promise. But look at the titles that finish it off: off-kilter versions of pop warhorses. McGriff was a vet of playing dance halls, so he had to cover all the bases. In other words, the CD starts great and goes downhill. If you really love this kind of stuff, as I do, you'll probably still want to own it."
4,"Reading Comprehension GMAT, fourth edition",It was what I expected. I just need more examples to practice because the book has few of them. Now I have to buy another book with examples. I guess it is the business.
4,Overall a good book.,"Overall, this is a good book, with detailed and accurate explanations on methods and what to expect in the exam.One thing can be improved though - the questions/quizzes. Very small portion of the questions are not really good ones."
5,Fantastic!!!!,"I highly recommend this book for anyone who has not done the type of math in the gmat for quite a while. Also, if you would like to get some tips on translating the gmat word problems better, and quicker. Time is of the essance with the gmat.=)I found this book to be an excellent aid for beginners, and the advanced. You need to get the official gmat book as well to get official questions. What I will tell you is after studying this book you will be able to tackle the gmat math very easily. Its all spelled out in plain english in this book."
5,Professional blade,"Forrest makes fine blades and this one is no exception. I use it in my 24 year-old worm drive Skilsaw. The blade is a beast- heavy and wide, but boy does it cut. I use this blade for general purpose cutting- 4X4 Doug Fir, rip cuts on 2X6 lumber, cutting 1/4 to 1"" plywood and it's just amazing. Every cut is sharp and the thing never seems to get dull. Yes, it's an expensive blade, but the cuts are clean, straight, and it makes more wood chips than dust. It won't bend, and the teeth retain their edge like no other. Also, it can be returned to Forrest and re-sharpened, which I like. If you want a professional blade that lasts and doesn't need changing often (as disposable blades do) then this one is for you. Yes, it's expensive, but it is also a professional tool and will provide value over its life where a disposable blade won't."
4,Rich book but...,"The book is rich, brings several ideas and hypotheses but does not bother explain those ideas. There can be too much information in a chapter to be able to draw overall picture of the topic. Still, it is a good book to obtain."
2,Plates missing,The print version contains several plates (some in color) that are completely missing in the Kindle version. They are useful in understanding the text.
4,cuisinart,I really like this pizza cutter. The handle is very comfortable in my hand. It is also much easier to use than other pizza cutters that I have had in the past. It has a very big wheel that is very sharp. It also comes with a cover so it is protected in the drawer (and so are my fingers).
5,very good movie,i love it its so cute silly and funny the monkey especcially i recommend for a gift for a girl they will love it girls review also im 1O
1,not what was expected,I thought I was getting the Popeyes from the 30's. Those were actually funny with all his adlibbed mumblings. This dvd are the newer cartoons and are cheezy and not even tolerable.
5,From the Back Cover:,"The pinnacle of digital technology has restored these cartoons to their theatrical splender, with crisp, clear sound and images that approximate the original movie-going experience. We have also restored them to their original theatrical length, with footage that was cut to accommodate television broadcasts in the 1950's and 1960's, and was unseen for fifty years!Popeye poses as a firtune-teller to outwit Bluto in ""The Crystal Brawl,"" faces ghosts while shipwrecked with Olive in ""Spooky Swabs,"" and fights for Wimpy's business in ""Spree Lunch.""

2,"Wait, Warner Brothers WILL restore Popeye in 2007!",Warner Brothers is in the process of restoring the classic B&W and Color Popeye Cartoons for a July 31 2007 DVD release. Original Paramount main & end titles will be a part of the restoration. All mastered from pristine 35mm nitrate negatives!
4,"Folky instruments, orchestral sweep","Lots of CDs smack you in the face first time out of the chute. This one grows on you slowly with its delicate folksy instrumentation (banjo, fiddle) against a sweeping orchestral tapestry. The two recreations of 1860s live performances are dead on. By the way, the movie's every bit as superb as this soundtrack; it got only limited distribution and most critics didn't recognize it for what it was _ nothing less than ``Huck Finn Goes to War.'' Mark Twain would have approved. Be sure to check it out on cable or home video."
4,I love period folk music and enjoy most of this soundtrack,"Loved the movie for its historical U.S. Civil War (Missouri and Kansas) significance, it's actors, and the movie's dialog. I noticed the soundtrack and since I love period folk music I decided to purchase this soundtrack. I am pleased wth this purchase."
3,I miss the old Strawberry Shortckae dolls...,"They were just cuter. These new dolls are starting to look too ""hollywood"" to me. All of the other Strawberry Shortcake items, from DVD's to coloring books and stickers look like the original SS dolls. My daughter loves to watch the DVD's and I don't even think she recognizes the new dolls as the same character she know and loves."
1,"What happened to the 5"" doll?!","Strawberry shortcake dolls have always been 5"" tall. Now with a 6.5"" doll, how are we going to include her in our 5"" doll houses, etc. My 4 year old daughter and I have all of the 1980's stuff and the newer 2000+ stuff. I am sorry, but this doll just won't work for us! Please bring back the 5"" dolls!!!"
4,Works just fine,"We had this AP in our office for some time now, and it works well (we are using a fixed IP address).One caveat about the range:This is a ""Class 1"" Bluetooth device with an output power of 100mW, which will indeed have a 100m range, but ONLY if the other device is also Class 1. All mobile devices (phones, PDAs) I know of are Class 2, with an output power of 2.5mW and a maximum free air range of 25m, effectively meaning ""same room"" indoors. Class 1 Bluetooth would drain the battery of a mobile device too fast. This one of the weaknesses of WiFi (30-100mW output power) - a WiFi card needs more power than a PocketPC (let alone a Palm) and will cut your battery time in half or less."
1,one tiny notch above junk,"The F8T030 is one tiny notch above junk. I got it working as a wireless laptop-to-printer cable, but no thanks to the instructions, as it doesn't work at all if they are followed. The network access point function and the web manager won't activate without a pairing PIN, the instructions say nothing about pairing, no reasonable guess works, and there is no hardware reset or bypass. Phone service doesn't connect to a person; it asks you to leave a voice message and promises to get back within 48 hours; it has been 5 days. Buy ANYTHING else!"
5,"What IS a best friend, anyway?","Every little girl will identify with Ginnie, Geneva and Marcia. Ginnie and Geneva are the closest of friends when Geneva befriends Marcia, a new girl at school. It's just a great story where friendships grow and change and work themselves out. Ginnie wants her friendships to remain the same as always. Marcia wants to make new friends but it's hard when everybody already has a best friend. Geneva is caught in the middle and has to choose between her old friend and new friend. My 8 year old duaghter and I read this together and it stimulated a lot of discussion about her experiences with her friends. She hangs on every word and can hardly wait to read more ""Ginnie"" books."
5,Contains some of the best gear.,This kit includes a link cable (use it alot) a battery charger (use it alot) a screen thing (use it alot) you get the picture.
1,What's in it?,"I am only writing this because being a mom shopping for a Birthday present I thought it would be nice to know what is included in this kit. There isn't a picture to try and figure it out on my own, and there isn't a ""This item includes:"" area."
3,Raveonettes - 'Pretty In Black' (Columbia) 3 1/2 stars,"Not many bands that make it to the top of the college radio charts draw direct inspiration from the very first generation of rock&roll.I mean,when was the last time you heard a Chuck Berry lick on an alternative rock CD release?As for Denmark's very own Raveonettes,they seem to start in particular in the late '50's as exemplified by the Everly Brothers,Buddy Holly and Ricky Nelson.Combine those influences with,say a healthy dose of Phil Spector and you get a good idea of what 'Pretty In Black' is all about.Heck,they even cover the Angel's ""My Boyfriend's Back"".How much more '50's-ish can you get?Worth checking out."
3,Opened for Depeche Mode...,"They were decent live, but they had some technical disadvantages. Sounded good enough for me to want more..."
2,Pop Go The Raveonettes,"Strengths:This album is musically more varied than previous efforts. Songs are in different keys, and the variance of key keeps the album interesting.Gone are a lot of the ""sound effects"" (screechy feedback, odd echoes, etc.) that got tiresome on earlier cd's.Weaknesses:The music is no longer new rock, it's retro pop. The sense of edgy edventure that made WHIP IT ON a classic is lost here.The retro-pop theme is underscored by the cover of ""My Boyfriend's Back"". The Raveonettes have gone from 'cutting edge' to 'oldies cover' band without the benefit of a hit of their own.They had a chance to be 'contenders' but chose instead to be a footnote (at best)."
3,See Chad Jenkins review,"""'My Boyfriend's Back' is the song that sounds most like 50's pop""!!! Wow. Great insight."
4,Excellent,"Those who've outgrown blasts of white noise and feedback at the beginning and end of each song may well enjoy this album more than the Raveonette's earlier material. I like all their stuff but I disagree with those who say this album is inferior because it's less raw. It's more mature, and it's excellent."
4,Even if you've seen them all...,"The average serious, life-long horror fan has probably seen the majority of the films covered in this book (I definitely have). What I really liked about reading this was the trivia the author managed to dig up about each movie. Definitely a good reference guide, as the titles listed here will ALWAYS be worth recommending to someone else. In an age where most movie-goers don't venture past the new release section, there can't be enough books like this out there."
2,"Try ""Movies You Probably HAVE Seen....""","A surprisingly pedestrian listing, which really reflects the sad state of mainstream horror these days (and let's be honest, it doesn't come more 'mainstream' than Fangoria).Sure, there are a few gem-titles listed in the book, but overall (unless you're NOT a horror fan) you will have likely already seen at least 75% of the films listed in this tome... and many of the ones listed really do NOT deserve the title ""unheralded""!Reflecting the bland choices listed is the ""by-the-numbers"" writing contained within. This really is NOT a book you'll re-reading again and again. It is truly ""lowest-common-denominator"" through-and-through.If you're new to the horror-flick scene, it's worth a look. Otherwise, I'd give it a skip. There is VERY little new in these pages."
3,"Nice book, but i could have...?","I've seen a numer of horror flicks. Mainstream, obscure, low budget and just bad. I've seen more than some contributing writers to Fangoria. If you do not believe-place a bet! I'll take your $$. This book covered some cool movies-no doubt about it. But most were mainstream at some time or another. Not to say they were bad, they were good horror flicks. I could dig up some more obscure flicks to...What is the point? They nailed some good flicks, just not what would have made my list. If Shockwaves did not make the list, then something is wrong."
3,Nice to add to collection,"I am a huge Bryan Adams fan, I just bought this CD to add to my collection. I am glad that I bought it, however if you are not truly a Bryan Adams fan I would not purchase this."
5,THE BSET AS 'HOW TO PROGRAM' BOOKS,"First i don't agree with the other reviews that gives 1 star for the book,i didn't read it but i read C# how to program and alomost the same content but with more for beginners,it's a great book and covering the aspects on .NET,this book not for beginners,i think it's for the intermediate level,i like the way that Dr.Paul and Dr.Harvey write the book,they don't leave any area without covering it 100%,after finishing the book you will be read for the bible of C# ('C# And The .NET Platform, Second Edition') for my great author ANDREW TROELSEN,he's a great expert in authoring a expert books,"
2,Not for experienced programmers - very basic,"I had bought this book hoping to acquire some C# skills, already having experience in Visual Basic and C++. Unfortunately, the title of this book is misleading as it covers very basic topics - stuff any experienced programmer would already know. For example, two paragraphs are wasted explaning that ""files"" are what programs use for long-term storage - duh!!! The level of this book is almost insulting! This book may be good for someone just learning to program, but anyone with more than a year of experience should not be fooled by the title."
2,Online help is better,"I would have to say that this book is not for the experienced programmer. I don't know why this is the title of the book when it seems more like a beginner's guide to the language. I am very disappointed with it. I have found that the online help is better than this book. But like I said, if you are a beginner it may be a book for you to look into. I would just go to a book store and look thru it before you place an order online."
1,Tries to cover everything but misses by a wide margin,I had my doubts when I saw this book. In my experience huge tombs like this contain more fluff then value. But on looking at the topics covered and of course the title I thought I'd give it a try. Didn't take long to realize that it was a waste of time. As my title states this book attempts to cover more than is wanted or necessary.
5,extra's a plus,"If you are a CSI fan this set is a must buy. I especially love the ""commentaries"" as wells as the behind the scene featurettes. Check it out!!"
5,More than a hundred novel and delicious recipes,"From such recipes as Zucchini-Coconut-Curry Soup; Stuffed Zucchini Boats; and Zucchini Souffles; to Mini Zucchini Pies; Chocolate Pecan-Zucchini Loaf; and Zucchini-Pineapple Salsa; John Butler's Zucchini is a wonderful compendium showcasing more than a hundred novel and delicious recipes for the humble zucchini. Now this versatile vegetable can be thoroughly enjoyed the year round at any family meal or party dining occasion. No zucchini enthusiast should be without their copy of this marvelous, practical, inspiring, and highly recommended specialty cookbook!"
3,The music is great but sound quality is poor,"My parents had this record when I was a child and I always enjoyed listening to it. So, I just wanted the cd version of this. I was disappointed with the quality though. It appears they did a lazy transition to CD. I didn't expect great stereo sound as this was recorded many years ago but I expected a decent quality. I could have given it a lower rating due to the sound quality alone but the music still jumps.Also, I just notice that price is very high. Do not buy this then, I didn't pay $30 and it's not worth it. There's another version of this that has better reviews for about the same price."
3,Have you read Left for Dead?,"I teach the non-fiction novel LEFT FOR DEAD to ninth graders, and this film is a gem! It is a re-enactment of the sinking of the USS Indianapolis. The movie focuses on the ship's captain, McVay. I use this film to give my students a visual perspective for when they read the non-fiction book. They enjoy the film."
4,MIssion of the Shark,Good story about the not-so-talked about military return trip of the USS Indianapolis. This was a secret mission so maybe that is why. But it is also the worst military desaster of WW II.Watch this then see the special on Discovery Channel with interviews from actual survivors.
3,Obviously made for T.V.,"Mission of the shark is a noble effort but falls short in depicting the real horror experienced by the doomed crew of the Indianapolis. On the plus side, it had a fine cast and decent acting. The main focus of the movie seemed to be not the disaster itself, but the ensuing courtroom drama and the legal ramifications.the budget was obviously limited and the shark fins look like they are made out of cardboard!Here's hoping that the major motion picture of this event- scheduled for release some time in 2009- will really capture the horror and drama of the sinking of the Indianapolis."
1,Richard Thomas sucks,"This made for TV movie sucked, Richard Thomas and Stacy Keach were horrible, I've seen high school plays that were better. Sorry."
1,Mission of the VCR,"I was interested in the Indianapolis disaster after seeing the movie Jaws, where it is discussed. I was hoping this VHS film would give me some more information, and it might have, if the tape had been of sufficient quality to actually watch.Unfortunately, the company that copied the tape for distribution, which must have been ""Bubba's Backstreet Tape Copiers and Stormdoor Company,"" apparently used one of the first VCRs ever made to do their copying. The tape is recorded on Super Long Play, and I don't care how good your automatic or manual tracking is, your VCR can't keep up with the grainy, flipping images of this tape. The thing is unwatchable. You can just hit yourself in the head with a hammer a couple of times and get the same headache. Save your money."
3,Code Five,"Code Five by Frank G. Slaughter is set a few years after the Vietnam War. Dr. Jud Tyler is highly decorated and one of the most respected field surgeons in the army, but now with one big flaw, while working in a field hospital in An Tha, vietnam a grenade went off, partially parilyzing him and giving him a medical condition called Aphasia.After being dispatched from the army his old friend and army asks him to come back to the hospital where he started his medical career because they are in dire need for good doctors. When he comes back to Farmingham he is shocked, in the ten years he was gone it went from a nice, quiet town to a runned down dump and St. Lukes hospital is in total chaos and its up to Jud to fix it.I thought it was an allright book most of it held my intrest and the ending turned out pretty good.I would recomend this book to anyone who is intrested in the field of medicine."
1,It's not always about you...,"This book represents itself as an academic discussion of the family in Buffy and Angel, and is dressed in the jargon of contemporary criticism, but is a largely unreadable essay of personal reflections about what the programs mean to the author. Better choices for the academic fan are Jowett's Sex and the Slayer or Wilcox' Why Buffy Matters or any of the collections of shorter pieces available in book form or on line, or, on the other hand, for the pleasure of well written personal essays with insight, Seven Seasons of Buffy. This is least successful of the growing number of Buffy studies."
2,Muddled mess,"This book purports to examine the TV series Buffy and Angel with respect to the characters relationships as ""families."" I thought that sounded like a great idea, so I read this book. Unfortunately, the essays in this work are quite muddled. The author begins each essay by stating what he will be focusing on for the duration of the essay, but then he inevitably meanders away from the topic. Maybe he should consider creating an outline before he starts writing and sticking to it! Another problem I had with the essays in this book is the fact that the information about the shows that is presented within them is often incorrect. I found that incredibly distracting and annoying. I am giving this book the two stars for the idea --- it gets no stars for the execution of the idea."
1,Wish I was an Angel,There was nothing new here. The writing is so dull I could not read past the fourth chapter. Save your money and buy the Buffy DVD's instead.
4,Cute show.,"My child likes this show, this was where she was a princess that gave it an extra bonus since my child also likes princesses."
5,awsome,"This dvd worked perfectly... didnt have to worry about if it worked or not, I knew it would.. thanks for letting my child view kai-kai over and over again."
5,The Best Prokofiev 2nd,"I agree with the other reviewers here, this is the best Prokofiev 2nd. Unless you can get ahold of the old Remington lp with Thor Johnson and Bolet with the Cinncinatti Symphony which has even a few greater virtues. I once found a sealed copy of that Remington lp with the gold sticker on the edge and all. And it still wasn't in perfect shape out of the plastic!! Lps are a drag, but for a great performance one suffers."
5,Love this book,"I stumbled upon this little book when I was a teenager. It catapulted me into a very profound and healing journey. I base my way of living on it still, fifteen years later. This book, it would seem, can take on elements of an Eastern philosophy, but is based in Roberts' experience as a catholic nun. This book paints a completed picture of what our souls' journey requires of us on its path to selflesness. It is an important insight to unexplored territory."
5,Excellent description of the Unitive State of Consciousness,"This book is an indispensable guide for all those on a spiritual path. Although the author is a former Carmelite nun and practicing Catholic and committed to the Christian path, I would not let this deter anyone from reading the book. She is a life long contemplative and her descriptions of the spiritual experiences encompassed by the unitive state of consciousness are precise, clear, and definitely a life saver if you find yourself feeling lost. She does not hold back in any way in describing those experiences. The book is extremely helpful for anyone seriously living the spiritual life. Her other two books are also invaluable; ""The Experience of No-Self"" is simply powerful and another life saver. Bernadette Roberts is a fully awakened soul and I am grateful that she has written these books."
3,Not bad for the price but...,"Not bad for the price but the downside is that (1) it keeps on slipping off my 9-month-old twins feet, and (2) the length is not adjustable.So currently it's just hanging there doing nothing. As my twins grow, I'm hoping they'll be able to keep their feet in it. But then again I don't know if it will be comfortable as the length isn't adjustable, and although it's elastic, unless they push it down they'll end up sitting like a frog.We'll see..."
2,Why did I buy this book!,"Take a good story line, mix it with misplaced words, sketchy thoughts, blurry imagery and you just might be writing a book similar to this.The author had good intentions. The novel, with a little work could be a great book. I was thrown several times by the situations presented, the characters' reactions and misuse or over use of words."
1,Horrible,"I would consider very little about this to be ""sensuous"". This is a (x amount of time) long soft-core production of a female that gets touched/raped by some guys. I found nothing about it appealing or provocative. It got trashed very quickly."
5,good accesory,"Hey what can I say this handy little item serves it's purpose. It gives you great sound quality, a brighter and larger screen by up to 50%, and I love the joy stick attachement. Great item if you own a Game Boy Pocket."
1,Sounds Familiar,"I have not read this book, but judging from other reviews as well as the editor notes, it sounds like the author is simply repeating the ideas of researcher Desmond Morris, who has been around for decades. If you liked this book, you would love The Human Animal and others by Desmond Morris."
5,"Young At Heart, New Edition, by Anne Snowden Crosman","A marvelous book, for those already retired or approaching retirement. 61 extraordinary Americans tell how to age and stay healthy. And the secret is simple -- stay active.Yale Richmond, Washington DC"
4,Get the most out of your prayer life,"E. stanley Jones first explains what prayer is and then gives good advice how to get the most out of your prayer life. I've found it helpful in reinforcing what I already knew to be true. There are a number of his prayers on various subjects that I found very interesting. I 'm glad I have the book and will likely refer to it again in the future, I would recomend it to anyone who wants a closer relationship with Christ."
3,slightly disappointing...,"i bought this book looking for some stories about bigfoot, because, yes, i am an avid fan. i was disappointed to find, however, that all of the accounts and information that are contained in this book are all the same facts and information that i have read in numerous other books."
5,To the core,Loren Coleman brings over forty years of collective study to the reader in this work. It presumes nothing and exposes some of the fabrications through the years. He gently leads you to a place where you can make a decision of your own without any prodding or suggestions. He merely presents the evidence and lets you be the judge.Something has been going on for a very long time and it defies explanation in our normal capacities.I appreciated the candor and openess Coleman displays and look forward to more information.
2,Boring but informative,"The author spends a great deal of time breaking down the accurate events going through time. However I found it a pretty boring read. I'm not sure if it's the author's writing style or the stories and events were just not appealing, or both.I could see this book being interesting to a future Bigfoot hunter or a Cryptozoologist in training, but none of my friends.I find it hard reccomending this book to read."
2,sasquatches are real but this book is boring,"There is a ton of evidence that bigfoots are real animals, I don't doubt this, but this book is boring and just rehashes things we have all read and heard many times before. The only cool part of the book is a the listing in the back that tells places too look for bigfeet. This is not a personal attack on the author, he is cool in my book, just that a real new find on this subject needs too be made before anymore documentatries are books are written over and over saying the same thing........"
5,Sure to be a classic!,"Through the years I've read many published articles and books in regards to this enigmatic creature. They were good to say the least but were missing vital ingredients, i.e., ""The Story Behind the Story."" This is where Loren Coleman comes in and fills in the missing pieces. He digs further into these accounts and we get a much clearer picture of important facts and details that other authors ignored,neglected orinadverdantly left out. There is no glossing over or added embellishments to placate those in need of sensationalism.Overall this book is a great read and relief from the canned gibberish that emanates from the so-called Bigfoot ""experts""whose sites proliferate the Internet. Like Joe Friday of Dragnet fame use to say,""Just the facts,ma'am."""
4,"The Textbook on ""Bigfoot""","Never seen a bigfoot or know anyone who has. Nor have I thought much about it. If there are any strange creatures out there, this seems the most likely. Many hominids or bipedal primates have come and gone on this planet. Did some of the primitives survive? King of the strange creatures Coleman relates nearly everything out there on Bigfoot. From native stories, famous photos and the hoaxes. You'll begin to wonder, is something out there? But you'll also ask why one has never been found. Sure, other animals are elusive and their remains disappear, but none like bigfoot. We know the big cats and bears are out there. We catch them and put them in zoos. Then there are all those decades, centuries really, of bigfoot sightings. It seems plausible, yet where is bigfoot? See alsoYetis, Sasquatch & Hairy Giants&Monster Hunt: The Guide to Cryptozoology. Or for more on the history of man and the hominids and the failure of evolution to explain them, seeWho Was Adam?."
4,Review from David,"Although a comprehensive and well-referenced history of sightings, testimonials, evidences, and analysis is presented, I am left with more of an inclination towards disbelief and that Bigfoot advocates are simply motivated by the intrigue of the search, the mystery and fun of the puzzle-like assembly of facts and conspiratorial theories. Their brainy tendencies make them adept at explaining away the dearth of evidence."
5,Great book,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Gave a lot of insight into the. Bigfoot history. Would recommend it highly to anyone
3,a very entertaining book,"The book teaches you about NAPES,which is somthing I did not know about until i read this book. But if you are a veteran bigfoot reearcher, you really dont learn anything new in this book, the author even copied his text from his previous books into it, instead of adding new information. If i knew nothing about bigfoot, i would give this a five star rating, but i know a lot about the bigfoot mystery,and besides the NAPES, i didnt see anything special about this book. Loren Coleman's other books, such as the mothman or Mysterious America, are much more enjoyable books."
3,Ok,"I order a 03 600rr harnes were it was suppose to be complete.wen I receive the harness I notice that the front headlight,cluster,horn and turn signal wires were missing now I have to look around to buy front guage harness"
1,Oh please.,"An exaggerated depiction of a young, white, privileged, liberally educated but unpolitically correct male, living in Southern Califonia, dating a equally exaggeratedly drawn, politically correct, granola girl. Oh, the hijinks they will have!!! Please.Reading this book was like visiting the sterotypical bachelor pad, complete with scenes featuring the amusements of belching, bragging about great sex, gleeful recapitulations about dirty clothes, dishes, etc. Unless you're into that type of humor, don't bother with this book. It was so dumb. There was also some ""serious"" story line, but I couldn't follow it because I was so bored and annoyed with the author's relentless quips.The only thing I thought was remotely interesting was that the main character clearly had unresolved sexual feelings for his sister. If the author had addressed that issue, perhaps the book would have been interesting. Perhaps."
1,Fodder for remainder table,"Responding to several reviews that hailed this work as the sound of a refreshing new voice, I approached it with eager anticipation. Alas, despite repeated attempts to get into the book, I could not get very far. That new voice is sophomoric, and although the vacuousness is doubtless an artifice to expose the mind of the narrator, I decided after the third try that life is too short to spend any of it getting to know Ronnie and his friends. Too bad to sacrifice trees for this."
1,poor,Bare fruit organic dried apples with cinnamon 16 oz. bags 3. Product taste terrible and was not crunchy as the previous bag I bought at cosco.I need to dry them out as they taste like they are damp and not crunchy.I rate them poor to minus poor.
1,2 of the three bags of dried fruit had webbing and bugs,i have ordered the bare fruit dried apples many times with great results. however this time the shipment of 3 bags came with 2 bags of spoiled product. there is webbing (spiders) and bugs in the bags.i am frustrated since there is no way to get an exchange or refund for the spoiled product. amazon.com says there is a customer service button on the return page...however i can not find it. i will try to contact bare fruit some other way. rtr
1,Junk.,"Contrary to the stamp on the bottom, this pottery is NOT dishwasher or microwave safe. It will crack, pop, break, and explode in either machine. And good luck getting anyone to replace multiple pieces at a time. I paid a MINT for an full set of dinnerware and several serving dishes, fought with everyone to get replacements, and ended up skeet shooting the remaining pieces. Once the glaze is cracked or broken, the pieces are unusable due to undisclosed lead content."
4,Happy with purse,"This purse is of good quality. The color is beautiful. I like the adjustable shoulder strap, which stays on my shoulder without slipping off. There are enough pockets for me, however, I am still learning where I have put things, in which pocked."
2,A bad book about good artists,"Living Artists is a departure for Ivy Sundell. Striving desperately to be a book with a diverse collection of artists, it tries to be a children's introduction to art at the same time. Unfortunately, the book does disservice to the artists. Poor typography, bad page layouts and terribly printed reproductions are the three main problems (check out the graphite on paper drawings reproduced in purple!). To a serious reader of art literature, this book comes across as kitsch and gimmicky, with its 3D glasses and strange 3D interpretations of 2D work. Sundell's past two books have been wonderful surveys of Chicago and regional artists--why not continue the trend? It's great to see so many wonderful artists lending their skill and time for the book, but I can imagine a few artists sorely hurt by the book's poor quality."
4,Tasty,"Mellow, restrained, no wasted effort, no wasted notes. Joe's masterful, of course, but its the way these guys really listen to each other that makes this album special.This is a great album for studying, a quiet dinner, a romantic evening by the fire..."
2,bloated mediocrity,"I must admit that I found the below reviews far more enjoyable than the Rubenstein E Flat. In the notes (referring to Lhevinne's American debut in 1906) one finds ""The critics even then thought the concerto old-fashioned, and thus ended the history of the Rubinstein E Flat"". I don't mind ""old-fashioned"", but I do mind unnecessarily bloated music filled with mediocre melodies. In that light, I don't find it inappropriate at all that ""thus ended the history of (this concerto)"". Yes, there were ""huge chordal stretches, healthy virtuosity, and chromatic flourishes"", however I don't find this to make ""excellent music"" or ""good sound"" as says David Dubal. Those qualities are inherent in music that endures. In my mind the Rubinstein E Flat fails that test."
4,Good Discussion Group Book,"At our Catholic parish, we used this book for our Adult Faith Formation book study. It was an excellent resource for this, generating good questions and discussions. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that a bit more on Scripture could have been helpful, I felt that chapter was not as well developed as it could have been.Overall, it is a brief review of basic Catholic teaching presented in a friendly and interesting manner and is useful in group discussions, Returning Catholic Ministry, possibly RCIA and other situations where adults can discuss their faith."
1,"Not a good tool, keep looking.","I'm an Avionics Technician and i used this tool quite extensively specially for small gaged wires used in aviation, I do not recommend this tool. It doesn't come very sharp from the factory, the insulated handle is plastic, not rubber which makes it uncomfortable to use, and after just a few uses is being to slide off, making it extremely hard to strip wires. I suggest go do not buy this tool and you keep looking, Craftman sells on the is quite good and is the one I've been using lately."
5,A great tool for young children at Mass,"A fun and reusable color and wipe off book which will help even very young children enjoy and follow along with the parts of the Mass. your child will enjoy it week after week while learning Mass prayers and responses. I would highly recommend this for even very young children, as the coated pages are practically indestructible and will last for years. My own eight year uses the book every week."
2,"Great idea, good research, poor characters.","A great idea, a series based on a single family rooted in the greastest warriors and leaders of Rome and it's rivals. Good research by Hawke on the Civil War era, okay research on pre-civil war Rome. Poorly written characters make this book the failure that it is. He takes the worst honorable, deadpan, open character types in Clancy/Griffin fashion, makes them even worse, and then passes them on to us."
4,This one has the good stuff,"It doesn't take long reading reviews on Popeye DVD's to realize everyone wants to get their hands on the old B/W Max Fleischer cartoons. And this one has at least 5 good ones, all restored.My kids love this stuff. It doesn't try to teach you anything.Of course, they can't appreciate the differences between the Fleischer and the King incarnations. It's all funny to them. For the price this one is worth it. The DVD compression quality is good too."
3,not good enough for my kids,"Unfortunately, my 2 kids didn't like this. I guess ""modern"" kids aren't into these old cartoons. Too bad, I liked it."
4,This is a great mentor in book form!,"If you have an idea to market a product, this is a must-read. This book is a great place to start your journey."
3,"Ok, but could be better","I found the bag to be just a bit small. The handles are too short, and it is a struggle to hold both of them together when picking up. The velcro straps to hold my night stick do not function very well. Since I only use the bag only to transfer my gear from my pov to my patrol car it is addequate for my needs."
5,Only and Rare Hooters Live!,"The Hooters are the Philadelphia band who became huge by the major label release in 1985 featuring the hits such as AND WE DANCED, DAY BY DAY, ALL WE ZOMBIES and WHERE DID THE CHILDREN GO. This live was recorded in Germany in 1993 right after they released OUT OF BODY. Naturally they have only two debut album hits AND WE DANCED and DAY BY DAY. Yet the opening intro of AND WE DANCED is just hilarious. JOHNNY B is another of the highlight with the audience sharing the part of the chorus.If they could add the original version of TIME AFTER TIME, it could have been much better, I think. Must-have for Hooters fans and some of 80s pop rock fans who want them back."
5,An unique exquisite series,"I'm not usually into Manga, but for FAKE of Sanami Matoh. Here you have enchanting characters, a real plot, a sweet teasing seduction-type love story, where the gist of the plot is the sense of anticipation, will Dee succeed in making his beloved Ryo fall in love with him? The tough Dee and gentle Ryo are simply adorable, and the fact that they are both supposed to be detectives at NYPD Police requires only a moderate amount of suspension of disbelief. Bikky and Carol,two wayward kids entrusted to Ryo's (and Dee) care are absolutely endearing. Notably there is a zany humour pervading the series that, though for ""late teens"" and not recommended for the homophobic, is narrated in a gentle and poetic way, no concession made to vulgarity or crude scenes. I think that. as a graphic novel , FAKE ranks as one of the best, next to Monsieur Jean of Dupuy-Berberian. A must read for the comic novel connoisseur!"
5,Snobby Fangirl gets her come-uppance...,"I used to turn my nose up at slash, I admit it. I bought this book based on a reccommendation from a teen librarian and...well, I'm a changed woman now. Ryo and Dee are wonderful and engaging, and I love watching their sweet romance unfold. There's just enough plot and action to satisfy my literary fangirl side, too. If you're wondering what all the fuss is about...pick this up and find out. You'll be hooked."
5,SWEET,"Man I just got on Friday and I love it. The way the story is tell is great. If you are a Cowboy Bebop fan, you should read it."
4,Fake's a lot of fun and that's enough,"I know some people really want to know that what they are buying is an all out masterpiece before they will spend what little money they have on it, and that's okay, this isn't a masterpiece. Nausicaa Valley of the Wind, Akira, Ranma (yes I think Ranma is a masterpiece of the comedy genre), and Please Save My earth are just a few true masterpieces to behold but this is still worth a lot too, worth the money to spend it on that is.Its funny, yes there's a lot slapstick, but sometimes we all need slapstick and just plain fun. And yes it involves a guyXguy relationship, if that is a problem for you go away and I hope you grow up someday. For all that have no problem with that this is definitely a great buy well worth every penny. ^__^"
5,Fake is great.,"This manga series has to be one of the greatest ever. Not just one of those mangas that waste shelf-space in the book store. The plot is both edearing and fun, although at times you do get confed at whether the two main characters (both boys) love each other, or at least, if one of them really means to hit on him, and not be loved back.This book is really great and has a lot of different genres enrolled into one book, including shonen-ai romance, action, cops, comedy, and yes, MEN IN UNIFORM!This is a great read, and the farther you read the book, the more ingaged you become to its plot and story.Keep in mind, this does have shonen-ai (yaoi) action."
5,Fantastic shounen-ai series with a good plot,"Wow, I only just read the first volume in the Fake series and I'm already thrilled by it. I'm sure that I will like this series just as much as I loved the Kizuna series by Kazuma Kodaka. Actually both series have certain similarities, while maintaining their individual characters.Ryo and Dee are two New York City cops and become partners at work. Their first job is to investigate the murder of a drug dealer and the resulting events of their investigation not only get Dee kidnapped, but also increases the emotional level of their partnership.I really like the characters of Ryo and Dee. Ryo is the thoughtful person, who is quite overwhelmed by the feelings Dee awakes in him, and Dee is the funny person who instantly begins flirting with Ryo. The story is gritty, as you would expect of a police story. Altogether a fantastic read."
5,Pulled a Stright Girl In!,"A gay friend of mine got me into this and most of the time he pushes a lot of stuff on me I don't really care much about (in manga/books, his real life of course I'm really interested in) and I sigh and say ""ok, sure"" but I actually really got into FAKE. I liked the characters, the story, everything. Ended up reading his then buying my own (and the follow-up movie).I usually only like dark, grisly soul-damning kind of tragedies, mostly fantasy based. But something about the relationships (all of them, all of the dynamics) in the series just kept me reading and drew me in. It was a nice change."
3,"Decent story, better characters","The first installment of the series and my first venture into yaoi, I wasn't sure what to expect. Ryo is transferred to a new police precinct, and is paired up with Dee. Right away things get weird for Ryo when Dee starts flirting with him, and then starts kissing him. Dee swears he's not gay, but come on now! He only has eyes for Ryo!Its not the strongest storyline in this first one, but its not bad either. I was willing to finish it and move on to volume 2 after this one."
5,"Fun, hilarious, and informative!","First and most important, this book is hilarious. However, that's subjective, so I'll talk about something else. It's a nice deal for two or three books crammed into one. The quality seems pretty good as my book is still intact. Another one of its great features is the intro by Pastis and his comments throughout the book, which are enlightening and as hilarious as the comics themselves. This is my first comic book purchase (I've always just read them in the paper) and I plan on buying Pastis' other treasuries."
5,Pearls is a gem!,Stephan Pastis's Pearls before Swine proves that the pun is NOT the lowest form of humor. Punsters will love his books. And this is one comic strip that started out good and keeps on getting better and better. How can anyone not love the crocodiles?
3,Good for new fans.,"I love Pearls Before Swine, and have already purchased BLTs Taste So Darn Good and This Little Piggy Stayed Home. That's why I'm sad to say I'm disappointed in this book. It contains exactly the same comics from the previous books, with a few Pastis comments, bordering on self-aggrandizing, sprinkled throughout.If you have BLTs Taste So Darn Good and This Little Piggy Stayed Home already, skip this book. But, if you haven't read them, go for this one."
4,The Start Of Greatness,"This treasury collection of Pearls before Swine collects the first 2 years of the strip. As such it is very rough at times as Stephan Pastis was still figuring out where he was going and everyone's character. The comments left within are an amazing insight into his work. For new readers, you might want to start with the 2nd treasury as that is where Pastis truly hits his stride (and where the fraternity of crocs first appear) but if you want to see where it all began then this is a must buy!"
1,A Poor Imitation of the Sensational British Horrible History Series,"It is a disgrace to blatantly copy a successful idea and an even bigger shameful act when what you produce is no where near the same high quality of what you ripped off. The Horrible Histories series was groundbreaking in making history more entertaining and interesting especially for young readers and this rip off of that idea (History Horrors, a title obviously designed to come up in the same search as Horrible Histories) does not have the same high quality of illustrations or information that Horrible Histories does. Reward the pioneers who took the risks and came up with the ideas and buy the much better books from the Horrible Histories series instead!"
1,Bunch of Drivel,What a bunch of nonsense! If you want to read a sob story about one of the world's most evil cults - this pile of spittle is for you. One can't help but wonder why the lunatic Joseph Smith didn't prophesize the downfall of his Royal line. Perhaps he was too busy dealing with Kolob.
2,Yawn,Any hope of groundbreaking music from these fools was dashed. Coal Chamber will turn into Marilyn Manson for mongos and disappear forever. Any band that needs Ozzy to make a good record should quit.
4,good collection,"I enjoyed this DVD collection because i only have the VHS of these 2 movies and since they're on DVD this rocks! i dont care wat u say,Cheech And Chong made a good idea into a great 1 and Up In Smoke is the BEST movie they ever did!"
3,Half-good,"They both are cool movies, but if they are gonna sell a 2 pack of movies do it with 2 great movies. Still smoking kind'a suck."
2,Pointless,"What's the point of this. They could have released all the movies including the rarer ""Get Out of My Room"" in one set. They instead pick the classic ""Up in Smoke"" which has already got a lot of extras, and probably their worst movie (debatable with ""Corsican Brothers"") and certainly least funny. That DVD had no extras, and there isn't any extras advertised on the front, so I'm asuming there aren't any. This also leaves the door open to more sets, possibly a ""Nice Dreams"" and ""Next Movie"" combo, which we don't need either. The ""Up in Smoke"" movie raises it to 2 stars which is as high as it will go."
3,"Good book, age range is off","The devos in the book are great, but advertising it for children as young as 2 is mis-leading. Maybe it's just us, but seemed too advanced for my 2 year-old to understand. We'll be waiting to at least 3 before getting into it."
5,God and Me Devotional Books,Love this series. A great introduction to spending time with God. Have purchased these over the years for my daughters and nieces.
3,DAV-HDX500,"Picture quality is very good - upconverted DVD's have much better picture quality than with nonupconverted DVD's on an analog TV. Volume doesn't go very high - ""normal"" volume on DVD's is close to Max. Would have preferred faster single disk DVD changer to the slow, noisy multidisc changer provided. Not as many inputs onthe back as I would like. The large number of parts in the box were intimidating, however it went together easily."
1,horrible,the description given is a lie. It was missing the legs for the standing speakers and the mini sound bar. the seller barely responds to any emails sent. I sent the item back and we agreed on a certain amount for the refund yet he about forever to pay back the money.
2,Any more laid-back and it would be laying down,"In this late-period small-group performance from Basie's fecund Pablo period, the Count plays maybe four notes during the entire recording - but, man, are they great notes! Seriously, this a very pleasant record by a group of old pros with nothing left to prove, and they certainly don't. Veteran Basie band guitarist Freddie Green gets featured side-by-side with Basie on the cover, and his peerless rhythm work is nicely featured throughout, but this album is so whisper quiet and unobtrusive, it's hard to really recommend anyone spend money on it."
3,To Pass Or Not To Pass,"It's been a while since I played this CD, which was greeted with rave reviews on its first issue in 1986. Ella was then in her late sixties, by which time her voice was past its best, which manifests itself in what could be charitably described as a wide vibrato on sustained notes. Listening again, I'm reminded of her later tendency to take liberties with both tune and lyrics. That would be defensible if it improved upon the original, but that was always arguable in her case, and the facility did not improve with the passing years.My copy carries a tracklist which adds up to under an hour of music, and nothing in the way of a liner note. These deficiencies are offset by Joe Pass's sympathetic accompaniment, which was for me the deciding factor in its purchase."
5,A jazz vocal masterpiece...,"Ella Fitzgerald and Joe Pass played the Playboy Jazz Festival in the early 70's, and they got a standing ovation, Norman Granz of Pablo Records immidiately put them together in the studio to record their 1st LP ""Take Love Easy."" ""Easy Living"" is their 4rth and final recording together. It is spectacular, intimate, and wonderful. Ella swings, scats and sings gently and smoothly. Highlights include a cool ""My Ship"" and a lighly swingin' ""Slowboat To China,"" every track is a gem. This is a must have for any jazz collector, as are all of the Fitzgerald/Pass sessions."
5,Gift went over very well!,I bought this as a gift and the person I bought it for was very excited!Thank you for putting this item for sale.
3,Easy Living,"Some mediocre song selection and unexciting interpretations make this a less then stellar disc. Only for hardcore fans. I recommend ""Speak Love"" as a much better combo of these two giants."
3,Easy Living cd Ella Fitzgerald and Joe Pass,"I like this cd, the intiment feeling of singer accompanied by a single guitar makes for easy listening.The product was delivered in good shape and in a timely fashion. I would bur from this seller in the future.YoursDaniel P. Testa"
2,2 MUSIC VIDEO TAPE,"I Bought This years ago at a dollar Store,It was released after the Funky Divas cd,It showcases Their new video at the time ""Runaway Love"" sold as a single on an EP cd. It also has the ""Free Your Mind"" video. just the 2 videos. wasn't a bad price for a dollar new back then."
3,Overpraised,"First saw this movie at its original showing in Paris, and it left me cold, as it did when I saw the VHS version. I ordered the DVD to give the movie another chance, and it confirmed my opinion. I find it vastly overrated and overpraised, the characters grating, Arletty's appeal puzzling, Jean-Louis Barrault's performance over the top, and Pierre Brasseur playing Pierre Brasseur.Mine is a minority opinion, I don't like the movie and cannot pretend that I do, but urge others to view it and form their own opinion"
5,Impressive!,"I'm a Zoom user and when my old GFX5 finally died, I decided to get this one. It's been about a month and its been an awesome processor so far. With the Cubase LE I've recorded all of my guitars (electric, acoustic and classical) and the ZNR noise gate is one of the best features. The tube and Energize features are also great, although the preset patches pretty much suck (As usual. Not really important to me). Definitely a good pro pedal. Definitely recommended!"
1,Almost the same as Rally World Vol.1,"I don't understand why about ten years later after Vol.1, the new release Vol.2 comes out with almost all duplicate songs from Vol.1???"
1,Not Pleased!,"I had ordered some Flags from various companies and not happy that one arrived with muddy foot prints all over it. I know it was placed during Independance Day holiday, but I am very upset because I am an American and just because I placed this order during an American holiday, I got dirty merchandise. No flag should be stepped on whether American or foriegn. :("
3,now hold on a minute,"Nobody's expecting a Conan book to be Proust. That's not to say a really, really good Conan book couldn't be written, post-Howard, but this sure isn't it. Still, hold on a minute with the vitriol! Green isn't bad at all - and his characters aren't at all flat... except for Conan himself, who, I admit, eludes Green. Which you might think is a fatal flaw for a Conan book, but no! As 90 minutes of escapist reading, you could do a lot worse than this book"
1,"a weakly contrived ""movie plot"".","this book was totally disjointed. the concept was sound,but from the beginning the characters were sadly two-dimensional.also it seems like Green couldnt make up his mind. and kept changing their personality to suit his poor story,which would have better fit into a hollywood movie of the ridiculous""batman & robin"" vein"
4,jazzy-dnb rules!,This is a classical type if that kind of drum and bass - jazzy. Recommended for relaxation and enjoyment for all you true dnb and EZ Rollers fans. Enjoy!
1,NOT BENEFIBER,"ordered BENEFIBER---that was shown in the picture--received a ""substitute""---that was NOT comparable---it containes sodium and potassium (which Benefiber does not contain)--I contacted seller---they were willing to take the item back---but I dont have time to be shipping 4 large cans of product back---very unhappy! Would not buy from seller again!"
1,Few dimensions are given.,I am used to making projects for which dimensions for the various pieces are provided. Not only does the author fail to provide dimensions but he also fails to even talk about some of the pieces that are part of a given project.
2,"OK for ideas, but not for projects","I was disappointed as well. I expected projects I could build, but nothing struck me as worth the time. The basic ideas are OK, marble rollers, and so on. But I would only use this stuff as a departure point for my own designs."
2,Is okay if you want to do everything by hand.,"In today's world not many woodworkers make things by hand. The book is hard to work with, difficult to find basic stock requirements and measurements. I would not buy again."
1,Virtually Useless,"While depicting interesting marble-action games, the lack of dimensioned drawings and detailed construction instructions make the book pretty much useless for the casual woodworker interested in constructing the toys."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I was looking for a marble book, but one on marble runs, towers, shooters, musical trees, etc. This book is rather cool, just not what i was wanting. There are some neat things in this book, such as a marble maze and a labyrinth type maze, a box with gears that pop a marble up, but none of these are things i want to make...so, if you like that type of thing then this book will suit you."
2,Harder than you would imagine,"the projects in this book require a bit more talent than an average woodworker possesses. Also, you need a well equipped shop."
5,A Very Good Resource for Children's Material,This book is a very good resource for planning story times and any other special children's programs. The songs are arranged in alphabetical order. I would highly recommend this book.
2,self-promoting,This book serves largely as a vehicle to publish the creative works (poetry and songs) of one of the authors. The remainer of the content of this book is trite and generally useless. Fully half of the pages are listed as APPENDIX which consists of pictures to be copied for use in the activities suggested.
2,Catatonically Dry,"This is an extremely dry wandering text. There is no conciseness and very little ""How To"" material in this book. The book wanders through a laundry list of what-ifs and anecdotes without offering actionable ideas. I was very disappointed by this book. Anyone who is busy will want to look for a different book, reserving this one as a library reference."
3,No purple,I don't know if this kit was for a different Dora pan but the one I used needed purple for the backpack and didn't come with it. Other than that I liked the colors especially the pink for her shirt.
3,Iffy. Works (sometimes) in a pinch,"I like the concept for this product. The execution is just not right. I used it in my garage to control an overhead bank of lights that was not wired to the wall switch. Even close, with direct line-of-sight to the receiver (5-8 feet away), the remote would sometimes work and sometimes not. It took a little playing with it to get it to work, a light press, but not too light, etc. Murphy's law made it so that it was always acting up when I really needed to get something done."
4,Great Value,This is a great tent! Awesome deal! Even though tent does not come with stakes still great deal for the price!
3,Good Book for Windows NT but not 95/98,The layout and material in the book is good if you are implementing ZAK for Windows NT but if your have Win95/98 clients the information is very limited. The book should have been called Zero Administration Kit for Windows NT.
3,Very (too much?) ambient stuff,"After 3 or 4 listens, I thought this album pretty much sucked compared to the 4 other (very good) albums I've heard from this excellent band. It is much more ambient/experimental (self-indulgent?) than their old stuff. However, as I listen to it and become somewhat used the feel of the record, I must admit that it's not bad. It's just different. There's no doubt that I prefer the sound of Selenography (their best effort in my opinion), but Systems/layers is beginning to grow on me (even thought I'm kind of resistent I must admit!). Having said that, this album really isn't a must for your record collection."
2,Bulbs worked well until they fell apart...,"These bulbs have the shape that we wanted and they produced enough light when we used them in our bathroom. We had three above each vanity installed upside-down and the light was bright enough for a lady's needs.Before they had a chance to burn out, the glass globe separated from the metal screw base on a few of them.Called Westinghouse and, after consulting their technician, they said that the bulbs are not designed for upside-down use in a bathroom due to the heat and humidity. No where on the box is this mentioned. We also have installed other bulbs above other vanities and have never had a separation problem.We are now going to try Phillips and GE bulbs and see if they work any better.I would recommend that you do the same."
4,Great Light to Greet Household Guests,This is a wonderful bulb with style and power. It adorns our garage and is over our front door. Seems to last a long time. I would add that several bulbs were broken in shipment but the seller credited me for each one that broke. Excellent seller!!
3,Very lively and dancy. Makes you wanna have fun!,i really enjoyed the content of this CD. My two favourite songs on it are the two which are already released- Mickey and Viva la radio. They are so lively and make me laugh and you just want to bounce around and have fun to them. Although it was good it wasn't like classic music and i think just a bit of fun. Good for a girlie night in!
3,great read!,"Its not the best piece of writing I've ever read and its obvious the author is just your average actress with a book deal but...it *is* Estelle Getty! If you THOUGHT you loved her before you'll love her even more after reading this cute little quasi-memoir! Its just just a quick, quirky book by a loveable little lady!"
4,Great Song.,I liked this song back in '91 when Diana Ross sang it solo. I think its even better now. And Miss Ross sounds even better on this update.
4,What a reality figure!,"Just can tell it is too real!Good voiced, excellent material...Must have if you are a fan of Gundam!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Maybe I need a book for super dummies, but I thought this book was a total waste. I have the basic version of Quicken 2003 and this book spent most of the time talking about the Deluxe and Premier versions. Even when Basic was mentioned, the screen shots were never the same nor were the menus.It isn't much better than the on-line help menus (and they are almost useless). I am using Quicken through trial and error and hope to eventually figure it out. If not, I can always go back to my old Excel spreadsheets."
3,Chic lit easy read,"The type of book you read on a plane as it does not require any effort. This author tends to use the same characters over and over again, the good old Cinderella story."
5,Tuesdays Child,Louise Bagshawe is a very entertaining writer. I love reading her books on a lazy afternoon. This book captured the characters and their life in a most entertaining manner.
5,One Classy Looking Watch!,"TAG Heuer's Carrera watch is beautiful. I wanted a simple, classic face and the watch certainly has one. I also prefer this silver dial as opposed to the black one; it exudes a magnificent shine because of the silver color. The buckle on the watch bracelet is also extremely easy to use - no need to use teeth to undo the bracelet.This is my first luxury timepiece and I am very pleased with it. I originally wanted an Omega but I'm very satisfied with TAG Heuer.P.S. - I'd also appreciate it if reviewers rated the product and not the purchasing experience. It's a disservice to prospective buyers."
4,Beautifully crafted time piece.,"Like the title says, it's a beautifully crafted time piece, kudos to Tag Heuer on this one. It has a very classy look, better than the version of the Carrera with the numbers at the 12, 3, 6 & 9 positions. My one issue is that the watch becomes slightly too ""top heavy"" through out the day. If the band is not fitted snugly the watch will slide a good deal and the stem will dig into the hand a bit (for left wrist wearers), for a $1600.00 watch (MSRP) I didn't expect it. But overall it's a great watch, the second Tag in my collection and highly recommended."
4,Got to love a TAG,Just got the watch and removing 3 links makes it fit my 6 and 3/4 inch wrist perfectly. I called TAG about the 50 m water resistance rating since chatter on the net ranges from do not wear at all while swimming to swimming is OK. TAG rep said that swimming was OK..do not wear in sauna/hot tub or hot shower and rinse off if used in salt water. Took it for a swim yesterday and no problems. The watch looks great and I hope to be wearing it for many years.
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased my Tag Heuer Mens Carrera watch on 09-20-2005. In June of 2008 my watch broke. I tried to send it to Tag Heuer, but because the watch did not come with a serial #, they refuse to work on my watch. The warranty does not cover the item, and I am having a very hard time getting my watch fixed. This is a very frustrating situation, and wish I had just spent the extra money to purchase from a local dealer."
1,this book is not recommendable,"This book is more reference manual than a Pratical Guide. But if need a reference manual, it is more convenient to use the online documentation in HMTL provided with Rhapsody. This book is not worth to make more comments. I am disappointed !"
3,MY REVIEW,NO SERIAL RECEIVED AND NOT EVEN AN ANSWER ON MY SEVERAL LETTERS!!!!THAT'S WHAT I RETAIN FROM THIS PURCHASE!!!IT'S A REAL SHAME!!!
3,Gritty City,"""Gritty"" is used many times in the book to describe Chelsea, MA and applies to many of the events recounted, the author's experiences from age 8 to adulthood. It is a no-holds-barred description of the author, inside and out, and her relationships with her sister, mother, father, step-father and lovers, male and female. Some of it interested me, a heterosexual male; some was stomach-turning. Although the author seems later to have found success, if not happiness, her status as described at the end of the book was profoundly depressing. For some reason she used italics for speeches of others and initial caps for her speech. At just over 300 pages the book seemed long."
1,Disappointing,"Very depressing, with a poor ending. At some point childhood ends, life goes on, and women are not victims, as long as they put in the effort to mature and gain some perspective."
2,not bad but....,as a chelsea girl myself i find this book very interesting. unfortunatly there are some details in the story that i dont understand or agree with. i'm sure these are just the authors interpretations.
4,Good Picture of Chelsea!,"This book paints the picture of the city in the shadows of Boston and all that comes with growing up, living, and working there. I would recommend this book if you want a detailed portrayal of the forgotten city past the Tobin Bridge! Also recommend LEAVES OF RED AND GOLD by Scott Chapman."
5,Continued Improvment of a Great Series,"Series 2 improves over Series 1 which was excellent (see myreview).My copy is from the UK so you need a Region 2 (orall Regions) player.2 Disks,4 eps: Ruling Passion,A KillingKindness,Deadheads,Exit Lines. I've watched 3 of 4.To quoteBlackhorse47 (UK) the actors are settling into their roles.Ep3 is the most interesting (were the deaths accidents ormurders?). Ep1 looked a little like a Midsommer Murders epDalziel becomes even more humane,becoming a godfather toEllie Pascoe's child-though he ""cold-cocks"" a thief in ep1.One attraction of Brit.mysteries for me is that the policedon't always have to wonder about getting shot or beaten up(it can happen,but its much rarer than here).Comes with subtitles (although the actors speak fairly distinctly).Highlyrecommended of this type.My wife continues her enjoyment ofthe series.In some of these,I was able to pick out the likely culprint (not Ep3 though)."
3,"Ok but, Dalziel is miscast","Not a bad presentation of Mr. Hill's work. But Inspector Dalzeil is so badly miscast, the story loses its flavor. I guess I was expecting a ""Morse""-like acting performance and was sorely disappointed. This series is certainly not up to the quality of the ""Insp. Morse"" or ""Insp. Lewis"" products."
5,Excellent Beginnings!,"This CD is essentially Mary Hopkin's portfolio before being discovered by Twiggy and Paul McCartney. Since she was not recording in a studio with all the support a record producer provides, there is a much greater emphasis on her voice. The first song ""Tro Tro Tro"" (""Turn Turn Turn""), is the one which Twiggy heard her sing on the TV show ""Opportunity Knocks,"" just before calling McCartney. It is a joy to listen to the song and imagine hearing her actually singing this music selection during her audition with Apple Corps Ltd.Her voice is quite high-pitched, and very well controlled. All the songs are sung in Welsh, but many of the selections are chosen from American pop singles of the 60's (e.g. ""Tammy"", ""Can't help falling in love""). It will be a wonderful addition to any devout fan's collection of Hopkin music.Anyone who dislikes pop or folk will not find much here."
5,Don't listen to this CD with any expectations,"This CD contains both pop singles in Welsh. It is significantly shorter than a typical album (about 1/2), but is worth it to any Mary Hopkin fan. Her voice sounds a little different than in her studio recordings, but this is because of the fact that she sounds more real -- not canned. The digital remastering obviously plays a role here. Don't feel threatened by the fact that most everything is titled in Welsh -- many of the songs are recognizable. An example of this is the song ""Pleserau Serch,"" the title of which is translated to ""Plasir d'amour"" on the album cover. This song is easily recognizable as ""Can't Help Falling in Love.""If you're a Mary Hopkin fan, consider adding it to you're collection. It's well worth the treat."
3,DECENT INDIE HORROR,For a Indie Film it's pretty good.. The blonde girl with those stockings is HOT. Funny Horror the Celery stuffed down the throat is my fav. hehe
5,Sigbert Rampe,"Great product, and great dealer!! fast shipping and good communication!!! Buy anything and everything with Sigbert Rampe's name on it. He is a modern day genius of the the highest order."
1,Boring,This singer is very slick and boring. She sings tragic lyrics in the most blythe sort of off hand way; I wonder if she even knows what these songs are about.
5,Burgmuller's sonata is a gem of thousand carats,"What talented musician was Norbert Burgmuller. Since the first time I listened this sonata in vinyl in 1976, I still wonder this musician is so underknown.This sonata reminds us to the best pages of Robert Schumann. Remember this work belongs to Op. 8 . So consider Burgmuller was developing his huge potential musicianship.His early death was a great loss for the musical world.This composer ownwd the greatness sense, deep musicality and above all a powerful conviction. Far from being a musician for the galleries he would have been able to clim higher peaks in the story.The performing given by Adrian Ruiz is honest, austere and felt heart.Buy this CD , because this work deserves being more known for all who loves the great music."
4,"If you've taken the intro course and want to know more,",this is a great resource to help you add some of the bells and whistles you want to have in your application to make it easier to navigate your database. Pictures of the screens you will need to manipulate make the processes easy to understand and follow. There is also a great introduction to Visual Basic for those who just aren't sure about taking that next step.
4,Dummies again!,"I liked this book and use it as a reference. I originally readthis, and then took [an online] course... which provide agreat interactive learning experience! I accompany my knowledge now with this Dummies book, which serves great reference for the beginner to jog the memmory."
2,Turned out to be less than useful,"I got this book when I entered the working world out of university- aside from providing a few very basic tips on how to format printing and what not, there is not much to this book that is practically useful.I wanted something that would pick up where I left off in college and help me make usable spreadsheets with guides to the various equations and what not- alas, there is very little here.This book is only for total beginners- you will soon outgrow this book and wish you had something that went a bit farther in depth and was of more use as a reference guide."
4,Cold War Intrigue,"'Intrigue' is dark movie that captures the feeling of Communist Romania, as an agent returns to bring a 'surprise package' back to the West. The story is good, and does deserve the title 'Intrigue' in spite of its obvious low-budget production, and somewhat amateurish camerawork. In one scene in particular, you can visibly see the cameraman in the mirror behind Scott Glenn, but that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the plot. I hope this makes it to DVD soon."
5,Consistently entertaining,"As with the first season of ""Nurse Jackie,"" I thoroughly enjoyed being back with that wacky gang at the hospital. I am always so sad when it's over. Can't wait to see Season 3. I love the punch lines that come out of Jackie's mouth at the end of the season!"
4,3.75 Stars...,"Nurse Jackie is a show that moves at a nice pace, has someinteresting characters and some semi-intriguing plots... Itisn't the best and doesn't pass itself off as... It blends comedy and dramanicely and is very much entertaining... Wish it had a bit more resolvebut they have not jumped the shark yet which is more than Dexter and Californicationcan say. All in all a solid show that I will continue to enjoy."
5,a real gem,What a great series. You really care about the characters. Don't know what happened to her gay freind from the first season but...oh well. If you are thinking of picking up the stroy from here...don't. spend the time with teh first season. In terms of he dvd...ligth on the extras but otherwise no surprises.
5,Another great dose of Jackie!!!,"Edie Falco lives her character again in this wonderful, frustrating, painful and addictive series. All the characters are so strongly played... a gem!!"
5,great t v series,"if you liked season one,you are going to like the second season as muchI hope that showtime will continue making many more."
4,Excellent,"I am almost afraid to watch Season 3 as Jackie's ""house of cards"" starts to tumble around her. Despite and because of her flaws, her compassion and skill as a nurse makes her a very sympathetic character."
3,Probably Realistic,"The pointless over-use of the ""f-word"" (among the rest of the language used) takes away from the quality of this highly entertaining program. Excellent cast of characters & fun to watch -- just too much foul language, in my opinion."
2,download speed was slow,The stream stopped twice and we hads to restart it. I would have prefered having a disk in this instance
5,NJ-2 Great.,"Ordered it for the wife's pleasure, she like this program and was anxious to get. I ordered it from Amazon and received a few days later. As usual shipment was very quick. So my next assignment will be to get season 3 as soon as it becomes available.Thanks Amazon for great service!!"
4,"Pretty decent, not my favorite","I would not say this is one of the best shows on TV. As for Showtime, Dexter is most definitely better, but Nurse Jackie is not bad. I wish it were an hour show rather than a half hour. Just when the episode starts to pick up, it's over! The writers incorporate comedy and drama into the show to keep you interested. Some episodes are pretty slow, whereas others make you jump right into the next episode - just like any show, of course. I also watched OZ and this is a very different role for Edie Falco, compared to being a prison guard in OZ - but this is a great role for her...very entertaining overall!"
5,Great puchase on Nurse Jackie Season 1!,I ordered this for my mother who is recovering from surgery and will be laying around recovering. She wanted something interesting to watch rather than TV. She LOVES this series. Very happy with my purchase. Thanks so much. I would buy from this seller again and again!
5,Great Comedy,I have watched the other episodes and this one is just as funny as the other I would tell others to buy this as well
3,Nurse Jackie - Season 2,I purchased this as a birthday gift for my son-in-law. The recipient loved the item and had requested it specifically.
5,Addictive Video,"Nurse Jackie is a great series, due to Edie Falco's acting. She manages to portray a deeply-flawed character, who still has morals and values. It is sometimes funny, and other times painful, due to the poor choices Nurse Jackie continues to make."
2,Mixed Bag Jumping From VB to C# Back and Forth,"For anyone interested in VB Graphics, the book provides information, but then immediately jumps to the same information in C#, causing an almost total loss of concentration. I presume the same occurs for anyone interested in C#. If the writer were to remove all reference to C#, it might be a good text on VB Graphics, vice versa would probably do the same for C#. I'll just keep looking for a good graphics text for VB.NET elsewhere. I can produce excellent graphics with VB6, I just hope I can eventually do as well with VB.NET."
2,Nothing exceptional,"If you know how to read MSDN documentation, this book is worthless for you. Otherwise is a good beginners introduction."
3,Will the author please test and update the code sample!,"I bought this book, but got disappointed immediately because most of the code samples downloaded from Apress won't work.And there are many obsolete method calls. Make me wonder if the author care enough about his readers at all.Please make sure the code works. Thanks!"
1,Nothing Interesting,Don't waste your money. There's nothing interesting in this book. It just rehashes the the most basic GDI+ documentation found on MSDN. Disappointing.
1,Not for Coleman 18Volt tools,This battery was found searching for a battery for a Coleman 18 volt tool set.It is reverse polarization and does NOT work.
1,Did not fit my Coleman drill.,"It's very important when you purchase this battery that you know it does not fit the Coleman 18V drill or power tools. It says this on the order site, but I think it ought to be more obvious. I didn't see this until after the battery arrived and I discovered it wouldn't fit."
1,Does not fit.,"The 18 V battery pack was the one recommeded to replace the 18 Volt battery Pack on a Colmen 18 Volt drill. The batter is to small, will not lock into the drill an will not fit into the charger."
1,I hated it!,I Pluged the battery in and after a couple of Hours it started to smell like the wires and the Battery Were Melted! Burned Plastic and metal! wasn't happy with this Product!
3,Coleman battery,I left one on the charger so it would be ready but died after a few minutes. I realized that you can NOT leave the battery on the charger. You just have to anticipate use and charge accordingly.
1,18 v battery,"It was supposed to be a substitute for another battery for a Powermate drill, it wasn't, wrong terminals and doesnt' work. Not returnable. Beware."
5,Great Buy,"Very Comfortable and easy to use. Very easy to fall asleep in, just make sure to tie yourself to something."
2,Noodles are the only thing you need for the pool,"I have been looking for a good water hammock or float for my pool for two years. I have come to the conclusion that some good noodles are all you need for your pool. I am over 200 pounds and this product is not very stable with me in it. I admit that the tubes of air are very easy to fill up and deflate; however, the reason its so easy is because there is not much to fill up and therefore not much support. I found myself floundering. I thought I would enjoy sitting lower in the water gently supported in the hammock, but its more like constant shifting and instability. Go to Walmart or Target and get some big noodles. They are great."
5,Fun in cuba,We bought this floatie to take to Cuba. It was the best thing we took besides our swim suites. It came with us every day to the beach. Easy to blow up and kept inflated.
4,Nice product,Does what is supposed to do and is very comfort. Easy to carry and well made.I recommend this product.
4,Kelsey's Water Hammock,The product is exactly what we ordered as we have had one before which lasted 5 years. They are sturdy enough to support a100 kg person which a lot of like products won't.What I do not understand in that I ordered two (2) however only one (1) was delivered and I was notified that the other could not be delivered and a refund was processed. .?????
2,"is mine flawed, or is it a design flaw?","You blow it up and it floats and keeps you under the water about 6"". The aggravating part is that one side on the hammocks bends in. It is from the metal ring that is supposed to keep it in shape. Nothing that I can do will eliminate the problem. If it didn't do that it would have a 4 or 5 star rating from me..."
5,Absolutely love it!,"I have admired these hammocks when I've seen other pool-dwellers using them. I took the 'plunge' and decided to have one of my own. I have not been disappointed. These hammocks are very light and easy to handle. Very simple to inflate, deflate and twist back into the carrier bag. This is the best pool lilo type of product I have ever used. There is no sweaty stickiness due to skin on plastic. Instead you have the cool water for comfort all the time. I am uncertain about the hardiness of the mesh, therefore my children are not allowed to fool around with it. I love the Kelsyus Water Hammock - I bought another as a gift for a friend."
2,Water Hammock,"The company did an excellent job with shipping and it arrived in excellent condition, however it simply does not have enough inflatable rim to support a person. I weigh 148lb and this was plenty big enough, but barely kept my head above water. I kept looking to see if there was another pocket to inflate, but I got all of them and it was fully inflated and firm.I was pretty disappointed because the child versions work so well. I bought so that I could tan in the pool and only my head, shoulders and feet were above water. Would not buy again.*I do want to say that I did not read all of the reviews before buying or I would have known it floats you UNDER the water. But even with that in mind I did not feel supported enough and kept getting water up to my chin no matter how I positioned myself and this just wasn't relaxing to me. NO WAY I would take this out of the pool to use (ex: in open water)."
5,Comfy--I luv this!!!,"OK--I don't give it 5 stars unless it's good, does what I want, tastes great, or whomever I gived it to was happy. Merry CHRISTMAS and Happy New Year!!"
3,Twisty but does the trick,If you want to be supported while floating just below the water's surface it's good. It twists and the light frame collapses into you at the waist. I bought two. One let on water right away and then I noticed the seam was already pulling apart. The company's response was excellent in replacing it promptly without any hassles ... simply an email to the dealer.
5,Great Pool Buy,"I have purchased many pool floats and the problem I have with them is that they can get a tear quite easily if left in the hot sun or dragged on the pavement. This one fixes that by having a small tube that can be blown up in seconds and thus can be taken with you to the lake/sea. THe build is great and it is probably the best buy for under 30 bucks. Buy one, you will love it."
2,Virtually Identical to a $10 Walmart Version,"Not only did the one I got from Walmart look identical (except for label Kelsyus), and cost 1/3 of the price, it is also holding up better.I bought the two at the same time and Kelsyus one won't hold air in the pillow.I've returned this one for a replacement and will give the company a second chance. Kelsyus has a good reputation but the two products I have bought from them have not held up.Update after a year: I have now purchased a dozen different designs of floats and this design remains the most popular for use with young children because it's the easiest to climb onto, particularly with waterwings (life jacket). My husband also prefers this design because more of your body is in the water."
2,Adults Beware,"Got two of these, If you weigh over 175 I would not recommend this product. Although it will keep you afloat. When you get on it the sides will collapse around you, almost like you're in a cocoon. Not very comfortable at all."
5,The best pool item we've bought!,"We've spent more time in the pool, relaxing in the sun, than we ever have. We love this water hammock, so far superior to the plastic, blow up type pool lounges. Kelsyus also makes the floating chair that is similar to this, we have two of them and love them too. These are very comfortable against your skin - a soft fabric that feels great when you're in the water. We also love the fact that when you lay in this, you are actually laying down in the water, so you stay cooler. All around great product - we love it!"
4,Beats the Heat,"This was really easy to inflate, but nothing is as easy as floating around in the pool on a hot summer day and keeping cool.I bought this a couple of weeks ago because I wanted an extra float for the pool. With the recent heat wave it has been getting a work out not only in the pool but in the gulf as well. It submerges every so slightly but is cooling enough to offer real comfort from the extreme heat. It is compact when deflated and easy to take to the beach as well. The construction is decent given its extremely reasonable price. In this weather however, it is priceless. I just went to the pool store today and picked up another water hammock for the weekend when the family comes down."
5,Water Hammock,We have found these hammocks to be wonderful and relaxing. Great for the backyard pool. The children as well as the adults.
3,Partially pleased...,"Ordered two of these. Both were great for a while, nice way to lounge while staying part-way in the pool and stay cool. However, one of the two started tearing at the seams only 3 uses into it. So, only one remains usable. Fun and relaxing, but not sure of overall build quality. Probably wouldn't buy again."
3,Very easy to use and compact too,"These are great for floating. Good support and only the head and toes are above water. Everything else is slightly under where it's nice and cool. This product inflates with just a few breaths which is nice. It's also compact, though I agree with other reviewers that it's a little difficult to ""fold"". Its carrying case tore after the second use. As much as I like this one, it has the look and feel of something that may come apart after several uses. We'll see. But until then, we're enjoying it."
4,Does the job,"These water hammocks are decent. They could use a larger air tube as I feel they sink too much. Overall, a good product."
5,Easy to set up and great for relaxing in the pool,"This water hammock does a great job of allowing you to relax in the pool. It quickly unfolds from the carry case and is easy to inflate. The material of the hammock is perforated so you keep cool in the hot sun.The hammock easily supports a 185lb adult and packs up neatly when finished for storage or transporting. It seems pretty hard wearing too, and has already coped with several children clambering over it and using it as a pool toy without any damage."
5,This one never tried to kill me.,"I have several of these pool lounging chairs, and this is the only one that didn't try to end my life at least once. It's easy to get off and on while in the water, and I love that it lets you actually be IN the pool while floating on it. If I wanted to just be above the water I could just put a glass of water under a lawn chair."
2,could have been better,Love the product and the idea...a friend of mine had one and I used hers last year and enjoyed it so much I ordered one myself this year and had it sent to my summer address which is in Maine...on the ocean...I am from the desert in Southern CA so I thought it would be so great to arrive at my summer place and have it waiting for me. I filled the outside tube with air and then started to fill the head pillow up and there was a leak...it would not hold any air....I was so disappointed!! Too much trouble to send back and wait for another one...half my vacation would be over by then!! I guess this just happens once in awhile.....I can still use it just not optimally.... otherwise I love it!
1,Pool raft,The mesh on this item was not sturdy at all. Was easily torn.Only adults used these and they still only last a couple weeks.
3,Informative book,"This book was very informative in terms of a comprehensive description of the turn of events between 1917 and 1921 as well as acts of revolution before and after these years. The basic moral is that if enough people don't like what goes on in a certain place, they will find some sort of way to change it, in this case, by revolting. This book teaches that if only the government had worked with the people in deciding what went on, events occurring between the years 1917 and 1920 would have different much more greatly. Overall, this was an informative book."
4,Long Road Turning is Worth the Trip,"If you enjoy western novels, such as Little House on the Prairie and Lonesome Dove, you will enjoy this novel by Irene Bennett Brown. From the moment you begin reading, you are drawn into the lives of her characters---from main character Meg and her tumultuous past, to lives of orphans Lucy Ann and Lad, to the antagonist, rancher Jack Ambler. Romance is quietly woven throughout the story, but is not a main focus of the novel. Brown writes simply, with no bad language or sex. And the lives of her characters are believable, as well as her description of wild, western Kansas in the late 1800's. This is a book you will love and even your grandma could read and enjoy."
5,A Definate Addition to Any Music Library,"It's hard these days to get tuned into music like this. Most of the time great new bands like Soulstice go unheard of for years and only if ""popular radio stations"" play them do they ever get out to the masses. A great chill out and late night cruise cd, Soulstice has an excellent balance of positive blues grooves and vocals. Providing not only memerable sounds and lyrics, this album gives the listener a constant flow of tracks which keep very well in line with each other. If you are someone looking for new sounds or just in need of a great kick back cd this is a great buy. Hitting the repeat button on the cd player will definately occur once you listen to this disc."
3,"Heavy on the grooves, light on the lyrics...","I bought this off of the strength of 'The Reason', a really smooth, R & Bish/Trip-Hoppy track that appeared on 'Om Lounge 4' and is also included here. This CD largely lives up to that track, making this a worthwhile purchase.My main criticism centers on the lyrics. They're pretty trite most of the time, generally going for the easy cliche rather than saying something original, or even deep. Trite in a Sade sort of way, I guess, but then, like Sade, the music largely manages to overcome their frequent forays into banality.Don't get me wrong: this is a nice disc. Not quite as tight as Esthero or Portishead, but surely in the same vein.If I could give it a 3 and a 1/2, I would. :-)"
3,Big Stone Gap,"I was very excited to read this book after reading all the great reviews, and after a friend's recommendation. I went ahead and bought all three books in the series. Well, I was disappointed. It is an ok book, but I was expecting much more humor. If you like Nicholas Sparks, this is probably your kind of book, but if you are a fan of Fannie Flagg, Jan Karon, and Janet Evanovich and like the out loud laughter, I would not recommend it."
5,"chewable, and tastes good too!","I bought them for me, and my husband decided he want the benifits too since it's not just another pill to swallow but can be chewed."
1,"in fact, does NOT fit a 95 miata","At first, looking at the gaskets i thought i could slightly alter them to make them fit my 95 miata (they were supposed to fit ANYWAYS), but i ended up only salvaging 40% of the actual gaskets and used silicone to finish it off. but hey, my entire engine rebuild was waiting on these gaskets/ mayyyybe i was in a rush. EXAMINE THOROUGHLY BEFORE USING."
3,Ok for price,Next time I will spend the money and get a better one. It is decent enough for home use but not school.
3,Buy their three original releases,"That's right! There's Too Many ""Best Hits Collections"" of these guys. At last count there were more collections of Hooter songs than original albums issued. That's just plain WAKED. I suggest buying ""zig zag"", ""Nervous Night"" and ""One Way Home"" via the used venue here on amazon. This way you own ALL of the great music & YOU decide what their best hits are for yourself, don't let some record industry suit do it for you."
3,Some things DON'T Change,"I'm a Bypasser and wanted to know if my progress was similar to others. This book let me see that much has not changed in the 15 years since Change of Heart was written. The patients experience and complaints with doctors seems to be the same as today. The fact that women are under represented also hasn't changed and encourages me to write about the Bypass experience from the perspective of women and get their opinions, needs and feelings out there too. Doctors need to read this book. Too bad it's out of print. Check your library. Good reading."
3,I'm skepticle,"man this event was overly-hyped. a few matches were good but some were ... . BRock vs. Goldberg, the two big boys of RAW and SMACKDOWN!, that matched ... . It was kool to hear the crowd chanting ""BORING!!"" though ha. Undertaker's return ws cool though. I wont buy the dvd though."
3,could we except more than that?,"This wrestlemania was by far one of the poorest technicly ive ever seenthe entire show was completly made by ironic match and a complete disaster called lesnar goldberg ,dont forget the very desapointing appearance of the undertaker with his dead man ""bad ass look"" whatever...who do u think we are Vince? we dont want this ""ù^% anymore ,and u want to perform 12 ppv a year ? dont make me laugh... event the world title was bad compared to good old 90's time not even a match was worthy ,The rock did a good perf and he made his first appearance in 1 year... i dont want to say anything else but Bret Hart was right staying home...The show level was like the other of the year quite good and ...there is too many ""fake wrestlers"" take a look at the cruiserweight open match a real joke ...dragon sliding..nunzio 10 pounds and kidman a giant fighting little gremlins...Can we have back Austin or Bret or some other real wrestlers ... i miss you wrestlemania 10 or 12..."

2,Worst Mania EVER!(...),"With Wrestlemania 20 being hyped for a year, you think WWE would go out of their way to give the fans the best event of all time. On the contrary, this PPV was just plain boring.The return of the ""Dead Man"" Vs. Kane: Nice new hat and Coat Taker. Where was the dead man we all were waiting to see? This match was a squash, niether wreslter looked good. *(...)Golberg Vs. Lesnar: I think this match was one of the best all night, not because of the wrestling, but the fans were so into letting these two have it. I would say it was the best crowd reaction since Hogan Vs. The Rock at WM18. *(...)1/2Triple threat- HBK Vs. HHH Vs. Benoit: The only match that lived up to the hype. Great Wrestling, Great story told throughout the entire match. (...)priceless. *(...)There were a lot of other matches during the 5 hour event, none realy worth watching or recapping. Overall, p1$(...) poor PPV. Do not buy this Wrestlemania!(...)"
5,Wrestlemania 20,I highly recommend this because main event and Undertaker vs KANE very good match and a lot more action !
3,wrestlemania,"wrestlemania is the biggest event of wrestling of the year.this one seems to be not liked as much as the XIX WM. but anyway this is my predictions(just in case wm happened tomorrrow)randy orton vs triple h (heavyweight championship match)edge vs shawn michaelsluther reigns, mark jindrak, kurt angle vs carlito caribbean cool, jesus (pronounced ye-sews), and some new punkundertaker vs heidenreich rematchrene dupree, kenzo suzuki vs rey mysterio and rvd (wwe tag team title match)john cena, eddie guerrero vs big show, shannon moorematt hardy vs kanegene snitsky vs batistamick foley returns and faces JBLstone cold returns and participates in a battle royal for the #1 contender for wwe titlecruiserweight battle royal with spike dudley, billy kidman, paul london, chavo guerrerovince mcmahon vs eric bishoff in a streetfight"
3,Did not live up to the hype!!!,"Everyone was chanting and raving about the biggest event Wrestlemania 20. I wanted to see it so bad. i paid 20 bucks to pitch in watching it at mai friends house. This was a good ppv for an average ppv like summerslam, unforgiven, etc. but not for wrestlemania, untop of that WMXX. Big mistake, this was the worst direction the WWE went.Here are some notes on some matches!HHH vs. Benoit vs. HBK - awesome match, no negativeGuerrero vs. angle- decent, except the ending was badUndertaker vs. kane- taker was a big dissapointmentBrock vs. Goldberg -too short, with more talk then ever, boringJericho vs. Christian- good match, liked it allotrock and foley vs. evolution - if only rock and foley teamed up with hogan it would've been allot bettertorrie and sable vs. stacy and jackie -t & a, thats about itmolly vs. victoria - good women's matchthe fatal four way tag team matches were a joke and so was the cruiserweight open (should of been a battle royal)"
2,Once again the WWE hit and miss at Mania,"Im a huge mania fan I own all of the videos/DVDs, and after a few bad recent manias(anything after X7) I really thought this one would live up to the hype, I was wrong. On paper quite a few of the matches looked really good, but really the only one out of the 13 that lived up to that was the Triple Threat Match Feat. Benoit, HBK and HHH. All the other talent put on a pretty average show. The best part of the show for me was Lesnar and Goldberg stinking up MSG. I knew Goldberg didn't care much for the sport but I didnt see Lesnar Leaving so soon. Also another downer was the huge return of the Deadman The Undertaker, oh no wait hes just died his hair black and looks exactly the same as he did 6 months ago. For me after watching this I felt like I just wasted 5 hours"
1,The last PPV you'll ever see 3 of the most populer stars in,THIS WAS THE LAST PPV FOR 3 OF THE MOST POPULAR WWE STARS IN WWE...Goldber....His contract ended...good bye billBrocklesnar.....Left for NFL...He may be a sell out be hes a smart one...Stone Cold Steve Austin....Was fired due to police reports of him Beating up his Girlfriend...HEY DONT THINK IM JUST MAKING STUFF UP THIS IS ALL TRUE....This was not the best wm.....the best was X7

5,WRESTLEMANIA XX,"RUBBISH PPV I ONLY GAVE 5 STARS BECAUSE OF THE CHRIS BENIOT VS TRIPLE H VS SHAWN MICHEALS MATCH AND FOR THE SPECIAL FEATURES.THE UNDERTAKER VS KANE MATCH WAS ALRIGHT ,THE CHRIS JERICHO VS CHRISTIAN MATCH WAS THE 2ND BEST MATCH,THE TAG MATCHES WERE OK,THEOTHERS WERE NOT VERY BAD AND NOT VERY GOOD."
2,one of the worst wrestlemania's ever'',"wrestlemania 20 was supposed to be where it all begains again, insted it could be where it all ends, every match was average at best, the only real good matches on the card was the eddie guerrero vs kurt angle wwe title match, and the triple threat match with shawn micheals vs chris benoit vs triple h which could be considered the greatest wrestlemania matches ever, other then that every match was either cut short like the two fatal four way tag team matches, and the cruserweight open, the goldberg and brock leasner match was the worst matches ever. and i expected more out of the undertaker and kane match. if you like average, boring wrestling at most you will like this dvd only pick this dvd up because of the extras it offers on disc 3, if you want exiting wrestling tune into TNA where you will not be dissapointed."
2,"Nice pics, bad linguistics","The paintings are, of course, great. BUT the interpretive translations are very poor. The poetry doesn't flow and is difficult to follow for me, a well-educated adult, let alone a child! I bought this to share the wonder of the fables with my children using highest quality art, but it didn't work out well at all.If you are buying just for the paintings, it's great. If you are buying it to read, I recommend to keep looking."
2,Works okay for a while,"This is the 2nd of these drives I've owned and in my opinion, they're merely okay. Support is more or less non-existent through Buslink. With the first one I discovered they're picky about power coming through the USB. The 2nd one just outright died without warning. I like the size for the most part, but with all the advances in drive and flash RAM technology, you could do better than one of these."
2,A tough read,"I think this book was way beyond my knowledge of Chile and its literature. It is only about 180 pages but I had to give up. That doesn't mean it isn't a good book, I just didn't get it."
2,A Ramble with Roberto,"The New Your Times Book Review has said nice things about Bolano's two newest novels, but I decided to step back and start with an earlier novella, By Night in Chile. I was disappointed. The narrative rambles among various conversations about literature and cultural history with nothing much at stake for the characters. It is oddly without plot.Moreover, Bolano formats his story into only two paragraphs, the last one consisting of only a seven word sentence at the end, on page 130. All dialogue is embedded in the one paragraph without quotation marks. Paragraph breaks and quotation marks are courtesies to the reader, and departures from these conventions should be artistically justified. In this book, the departures are merely rude.Bolano's great theme, according to The New York Times, is the sorry state of literature in his native land. I wonder if I'm the only reader to think that By Night in Chile is part of the problem."
2,Everyone loves this book and raves about it.,"Everyone raves about this book, but it's awful. The prose is stilted, unimaginative, cliche-ridden, and self-indulgent. It could have been 1/3 as long (and it's short) and would have been twice as good."
2,Not Worth the Effort Required,"I'm sorry but I just don't get the fascination with this book. The seemingly endless paragraph which makes up most of the book wore me out. I finished it, but just barely."
3,Interesting early Brubaker,The worst of Brubaker is still a cut above the rest.This book collects only the first four issues.I would have preferred a collection of series in it entirety. Luckily the remaining issues can be found several places online for about a dollar per issue.I recommend this series for mature readers but suggest saving money by purchasing the original printings.
3,The Sorcerers does not Exactly Cast a Spell,"A decent presentation of an older Karloff film, The director best known for ""Witchfinder General"" (aka The Conqueror Worm) delivers an interesting tale of an older couple playing mind control with the younger generation. Very dated along with the sound that is less less than to be desired. This is probably the best copy available and such a title would probably not command a remastering. Probably for Michael Reeves (the director) and Karloff fans only. This is not as impressive as Reeves' final film as mentioned."
3,love Sebastian...,"but this is not a 4-1/2 star album.more like 2-1/2. sorry. the newrecord is great, though...- cRAIG"
1,the worst,"Shockingly bad! The new material, what little of it there is, is sub-generic. The band can't play the old skid row stuff, playing most of them way too fast. To top it all off, the photos of the band are the supidest things you will ever see! (A balding guy in a green lamme angel costume, complete with wings!!!)"
1,wow,"Bach sounds bad, the band sounds bad (although he has the band backed so far down in the mixing that you can barely hear them), speaking of mixing .... it is bad.Sounds like Bach just screached out the vocals, and recorded them without even listening to them. He then told the mixer to turn him up as loud as he could because it is Bach's album afterall, nobody dumb enough to buy this could possibly want to hear the music.Any doubts? listen to the samples, if you can make it through them all you're a tougher man than me!"
3,SKID ROW LIVE ALBUM,"Very Cool live album, Skid Row don't really have a live album apart from ""Subhuman Beings on Tour"" which is really an EP rather than an album, so its great to hear Skid Row classics performed live even if its on a Bach solo album. A bit odd that Bach's first solo album after leaving Skid Row is a live album of Skid Row songs (plus a few new tracks) but than maybe he realised that the band never released anything live before and decided to cash in first, on his own."
5,Sebastian still rules!,"This is an excellent live album. Sebastian rocks as always, and you can almost feel his stage presence through the recording. The album has a some of the Skid Row classics (Slave, 18& Life, I remember you, youth gone wild), and they sound excellent. Also, there is a remake of Godzilla thrown in that is amazing. The new material is great too. I would highly recommend this to anyone that was or is a Skid Row fan. Sebastian hasn't lost any of his appeal or voice range, and this album proves it."
4,Geat and Easy,I love this book. It's easy to use and I feel comfortable using it in my sunday school class. I teach toddlers to 3rd graders. I makes learning easier and fun.
1,Not satisfied with this purchase,"Hi,I could not put review on this product, because Amazon sent me a wrong item. What I ordered was PARALLEL ADAPTER DB25F/CENT36F, buy what I received was PARALLEL ADAPTER DB25M/CENT36F. This item has been returned.Fuchang"
2,The First Farmers,This is not one of the better books I have read on history that predates mankind. Before reading the book I knew that women were the first farmers. The author uses this fact as the basis for thousands of years of discrimination against women. I do not buy the argument.
4,Great bulb & a great deal from Amazon!,"This is an awesome product. I haven't had them long enough to tell how long they last, but it has been around 2 months and they are still going strong. I got these because regular bulbs just go out so fast in our lights for some reason. These are an awesome replacement.The only thing I didn't realize when purchasing is that they don't work very well with a dimmer. Regular bulbs will just dim out gradually, these dim out but in big leaps; from a lot of light to a little in one notch. Other than that they are compact and worth the purchase so far."
2,Don't Like Them,"I don't like the light that comes out of these bulbs. I don't like it at all and it makes my head hurt. Yes, they're good for saving money but NOT good in the amount/type of light they show. I wouldn't buy these again."
2,not a good value,"I purchased these on August 25th, 2011 and already two of the eight have failed; one failed right out or the box- it would only mildly dim and got extremely hot.It had to be discarded immediately. The second stopped working after only 19 days. Needless to say I am not pleased with the quality of this product."
3,Globe 13 Watt light bulb,"I purchased a pack of 8 of these lights to replace my regular light bulbs.Pro's -They only use 13 watts.They are small but will hold the average lamp shade.They work well.Con's -They are not very bright.Not for use with any kind of dimmer or 3 way or touch lights.Not for overhead light use, they are just too dim.They flicker when turning on sometimes."
3,Inconvenient usage,These bulbs take 1-2 seconds to turn on and then a few minutes before reaching maximum brightness. I've seen better performance from other brands.EDIT: Found a great brand. Go to Home Depot and there you will find N:Vision brand fluorescent light bulbs. They are instant on.
5,Way too expensive on Amazon,"Call your local Ace hardware, find out when these will be on sale for $1 each. You can't go wrong spending a buck a piece instead of $3-4 everywhere else."
2,Not the brightest bulb in the bunch,"The only thing going for these (as opposed to other CFLs) is their form factor- very small. However, they are very slow on the brighten-up. So much so that I had to replace all these I had installed (except for one fixture, where no other CFL will fit). The Sylvania brand is brighter at switch-on, and also cheaper (purchased at BJ's),than these bulbs."
3,Great Value Brand seem better,"These lights are not that bad. They do help with the energy bill, and the light that comes from them is very appealing.The thing you need to know before buying these kinds of light bulbs is that they almost always take awhile to get to their full brightness, and sometimes don't turn on immediately. I do have GE, Great Value, and sylvania brands throughout my house, and from my observations the Walmart Great Value Brand which cost about 40% less get brighter faster than the GE or Sylvania brands. I have not had any of them die on me yet, so I can't tell you which ones last the longest."
3,These are Cute,"This windchime is cute. But the round part of it is made so nice, then the hanging part is on like fishing line. In the packaging, the fishing line got kinda curled up, and the chime parts dont hang right. I'm hoping i can either stretch them a little, or that they will hang better in time. They are so light that i doubt it. Two of them do still touch and make noise in the breeze. And it does still look nice."
1,"Faulty Product, Poor Customer Service","The amplifier came to me faulty. I spent two days trying to troubleshoot my knowledge in car audio. I took the amplifier to Drive in auto sound and they told me the amplifier is faulty, even the owners manual said something of that nature in trouble shooting. I contacted the company where they had forwarded me to a generic tech support that is virtually unreachable. I purchased the Jensen 760 amplifier for 30 dollars more and I am very pleased."
4,Not the best sound quality but worth the Money,This amp does not have the greatest sound quality but it is worth the money. I would recommended this amp if you need some extra power but you are not looking to shell out the money for a expensive amp. I am happy with my purchase.
1,trash,pure worthless trash. killed my cd player and has bad distortion with really bad interferencethis has a one start just because i cant give it a - 100000000000000000000
2,decent,This amp is alright but not very much power. the ad says 120x2 but the rms per channel is only 35 which is not alot at all. but if all you are using it for is to get a little extra bass then its fine but this will NOT make your car beat like kickers.
5,If only....,"If only Deaf School where around at a different moment in time, that's what the sleeve notes say and I agree. The release of this album brings back a flood of memories for me, art college in Liverpool, the whole punk thing etc in 1977. It was that punk explosion that killed off Deaf Schools chance of stardom, too many bands, not enough room for them all. The eclectic mix of all styles of music was refreshing and some songs reflected life in Liverpool past and present and this CD, basically all three albums and some live BBC sessions shows what could have been, if only."
5,A clever band that was ahead of it's time,"I first heard the album 2nd Honeymoon in the late '70s and was immediately hooked! They were punk, they were camp, they were rock, and they were very funny. This collection is a great way hear a unique band doing their thing. Enjoy it!"
3,"Well organized, but not enough detail","The way this book is organized would normally make it a great study tool. The book is divided up by the tests needed to get MCSA certified.However, I found that the sections just don't go into enough detail. When I took some 3rd party paractice tests I was asked questions that pertained to material that wasn't covered by this book. Plus, the pratice quiz that's on the CD has some errors.I would only reccomend this as a supplemental study guide."
1,Broke instantly,"Got it, used for a day, the plastic piece to the left of the connector broke off after 6 hours of use. I did expect the plastic these things made of to be a little less fragile."
1,Wish I would have read other reviews...,"before reading this book (or at least trying to read it). Like another reviewer, I too thought it would be a fun parody, but I put this book down before finishing and will not be picking it up again. I'm not sure who the intended audience of this book is, but as a fan of Ms. Braun's cozy mysteries, I did not like the content or language in this book."
1,The Cat Who Wrote A Cheap Pornographic Rip-Off Book,"I can save you from having to read the first 66 pages by telling two of the VERY few things that had to do with the original Cat Who books and were actually funny. 1: In a meeting with LJB ""...he (Qafka) sang 'Mas Que Nada.' She would later use the incident in her novel The Cat Who Loved Sergio Mendez and Brazil '66."" 2: After Qafka prepared an exrordinary breakfast for the cats, ""The cats took one sniff and slinked away, irritated at not getting the dried-up stars of DeliCat they so loved.""I would tell you what went on after page 66 but the escalating vulgarity, lack of humor and lack of connection to the original Cat Who novels got the book taken back to the library in less than 24 hours.The sexually exlplicit quote opposite the dedication page is not misplaced as I thought when I stated reading the book with expectations of writting consistent with LJB. It was adequate warning of the brainless trash that dominates this book."
1,"Zero, zilch","I must confess that I was unable to get through this book. By page 70 I was sick of the mess--revulsed. Scatology, per se, is not humor. Apparently the writer was not aware of that.The book has no focus. It is an ignorant, pubescent boy's idea of a joke. Moreover, it is a cruel and malicious attack without cause. I cannot imagine anyone reading it who was not a reader of Lilian Jackson Braun's novels, and I cannot imagine any such reader being even mildly amused by this nonsense.Ms. Braun is not the greatest of mystery writers, and her books, sometimes just too cute, do lend themselves to satire. But a lampoonist is supposed to be--well--clever. And this is not even remotely a work of wit or a work of art or a work of anything worthwhile."
1,"Someone needs to learn the definition of ""parody.""","I give this one star because the site doesn't allow zero or negative stars. This book is an example of something written by a guy stuck in the mindset of an inadequate male adolescent who thinks Beavis & Butthead or Howard Stern are examples of the highest form of intellectual comedy. To speak in language the author would understand, this book sucks. It's not funny, and it's definitely not a ""parody."" Avoid it."
1,Thoroughly disgusting,"Trashy sophomoric attempt to trade on the name of a well known author, the only redeeming quality is that the book can be easily recycled by shredding it."
1,Disappointed Book Lover,I was rather disappointed in this book. I thought a parody would be funny but this was vulger and crude. I thought I was reading soft porn. I am a voracious lover of all Lillian Jackson Braun books. I was expecting more interaction with the cats. Sorry to say I will not read anymore Cat Who parodys.
1,Don't read this!,This was the worst book. I thought I would gag after reading the first chapter. Burn it!
1,Silly book,Because of LJB I was given this book at Christmas. Boy what a dissapointment. I thought it was terrible and could not even get past the first CD.
2,A Good Idea Wasted,"What could have been an amusing take-off on the Jackson-Braun mysteries never rises above the level of strained scatological humor that sounds as if it were written by an impossibly well-read seventh-grader. The occasional flashes of genuine wit are so mired in excretia and effluvia as to lose their sparkle. This reviewer wanted to give the book a chance, given the intriguing premise, but soon realized that the author had (in an unfortunate imitation of Samuel Johnson) begun as he meant to go on. What was probably a funny riff before friends and after a few drinks, glasses raised and standards lowered, does not succeed on the sober page. This reviewer hesitates to comment on a book not read to the end, but life is too short and time too precious. My only regret is not that I didn't finish the book, but that someone else didn't write it."
1,Not so funny parody,"The Cat Who Killed Lilian Jackson Braun: A Parody is sort of a parody. It is more of a rambling, teen trash talk filled piece. Disjointed and non sensical. It seems to be the author's ramblings using all of the stereotypes of modern detective stories. I would not recommend it."
1,"OFFENSIVE, FOUL IN LANGUAGE AND CONTENT","If you are a fan of The Cat who books, AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COSTS! I couldn't even make it through the first chapter without getting sick at the graphic violence, sexual content and description of bodily functions that are better left to other books. This book is raunchy, vulgar, and not for anyone one who enjoys the lightweight mysteries of our beloved author. The book should have been entitled, ""The Parody That Killed Lilian Jackson Braun""."
1,a real sham!,"I picked up this book by mistake when I was shopping for books by Lillian Jackon Braun for my teenage great niece and nephew. the cover and the illustrations certainly are like hers.when I realized that this book was by a different author I thumbed through it to get an idea of what it was like. I was never so disgusted in my life..the book is filthy and isn't fit reading for anyone,let alone teenagers.I feel that New Millenium Press have done a great disservice to Lillian Jackson Braun by using a cover similar to hers for this filthy book. The cover of the book is so similar that it was placed with her books which were arranged in alphabetical order."
1,"Disgusting, don't buy it.",This is a thoroughly disgusting book that is porn ridden with many references to body effluvia. I find it slanderous of a perfectly respectable elderly writer whose works I happen to like. I'd give it zero stars if there were such a category.
1,Not amusing parody,"I began this book last night and intend to throw it in the trash today. I found nothing amusing or entertaining about it. The descriptions are crude, as is some of the language. All in all a vile book. I'm not some old prude, but I thought I'd be entertained by this book instead it's appalling. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!"
1,fuhgeddaboudit,A parody? No. Parodies are usually funny. This is one of the filthiest books I have ever read. It is more soft porn than humor. People who read LJB will be offended by this book and the people who would enjoy this book would never read LJB. Line your cat box or bird cage with it.
1,Don't Waste Your Time Nor Your Money,"This book is over the line. I expected a spoof, not some border-line porn written for men who are sitting in the bathroom for too long. The only thing comparable to the Cat Who series is the copy catting of the title and the take off on Qwillern's and the two cats' names.Even if you liked this kind of barnyard fertilizer, the writting is weak and the story does not hold together. This is only the second book I've thrown in the trash in my 60+ years."
3,Graduate Programs in Biology 2003 (Graduate Programs in Biol,"Book is good guide for those who are not sure which schools they would like to attend, so this book provide short list about schools.Problem with this book is its accuracy, it has many mistakes, especially with numbers.Advice don't relay on it, check first on school web sites. Good luck."
3,Careful!!! Mac Only!,"This looks like a great little tablet. Unfortunately I'll never know for sure because it was only when I received mine that I noticed it is a Mac only product. You can figure this out from the text of the ad after the fact, but nowhere in the spec posted above does it mention this.Ordering the Wacom now."
5,amazing inexpensive... what a deal,"I have used many other tablets and this is just about the same thing as the expensive ones. The presure sensitivity is a little tuchy but not to much. For the $40 MSRP it's nothing short of amazing, and you don't ""need"" drivers in order for it to work in photoshop, just for special features."
1,Macally doesn't support Windows.,"This Tablet doesn't have windows drivers available. I called Macally support and came to know that drivers are available only for Mac. Windows is not supported. Eventhough the tablet started functioning with windows internal drivers, it works only with limited functionality. The Pen can't be configured. So Its a disappointment.As far as hardware is concerned, it has good feel and small enough to easily carry."
3,Be careful with loading Mac Software,I loaded the included OSX software and put my normally iron clad Power Mac on it's knees. Do not load the software!
5,Great tool,"Great knife/multitool, I put knife first, because that's what it is, although it won't completely replace a nice leathermen, it is great to have in a pinch."
3,Leatherman Folding Knife,This pieces is highly functional and more sturdy/stable than some of the other pocket-type folding utility knives I have. But it's heavy. The pocket clip is pretty much decorative - you almost have to use the belt case.
3,Leatherman Knife,"Leatherman is known for their quality in design. This knife is a good idea that is poorly designed. The extra screw driver heads are great but the way it is designed into the product is poor. The knife is so large to hold the screw driver heads that it is actually bigger than a full sized leatherman with all the bells and whistles. I gave my knife away and went back to the Leatherman that does so much more with much less bulk and better design. Leatherman is a great product but I wouldn't recommend the knife if size matters, stay with the better designed leatherman. It is smaller and more equipped and cost the same amount."
3,Cindy Crawfords Next Challenge Workout VHS,Was disappointed that is only one work out when Shape Your Body was 3 work outs. Exercises were higher impact than Shape Your Body
5,Great workout!,"I have to admit that I've only done the workout once, but it was great! I was sore for the next few days, but that just proves to me that it will work. I plan on doing this much more. I can see how it would definitely get one in shape!"
4,good toning video,Well cindy did much better than her other video. This is a very good video for toning and the legs section really get your heart pumping and your legs working. Also i think the music is pretty good too. I like how she works on every part of your body. This is great for even a beginner. Except when she tells you to use three to five pound weights only use this if you are a beginner. I started out with three pounds when i first got this tape and now i use ten pounds and i still get a burn from the excesises. It is also good that radu her insturctor talks much less in this tape than the first one and we can all apreciate that! This is a wonderful toning tape.
3,Not as Good as Her First Video,"I have Cindy's first workout tape and I love it. The first tape has two 40-45 minute workouts and a 10 minute workout, so you can alternate between them. This workout is good, but it takes about 50-60 minutes, which is a little too long for my busy schedule and I don't like the order of the workout. I would recommend her first one highly and this one as a maybe..."
5,3 months and still going strong,I wrote my first review in OCTOBER 1999 and now it's FEBRUARY 2000 and I'm still using the video and have never felt better. I work out almost everyday and have lost inches and weight. My husband and family can really tell the difference. Usally I can not stay with an exercise program for more than 6 weeks but it has been 3 months now and I am still enjoying this video.
3,"Choose ""Shape Your Body"" Instead","After working out with Cindy's ""Shape Your Body"" workouts for months, I was thrilled to take the ""Next Challenge"". The leg work/cardio (first 20-25 minutes) is terrific, but I found that the abs and arms in the Shape your Body workouts did much more for me. I now do her leg work and switch to the original tapes for the other sections. If you don't have Shape your Body - skip this one and buy that instead. That tape offers two 45 minutes workouts that provide overall toning. Alternate the two workouts once or twice a week and you will see changes in your body that you never imagined."
5,Exceptional workout,"I am a huge fan of Cindy Crawford's workouts which are not only effective but also beautifully filmed with awesome music. The Next Challenge is by far the most challenging of her 3 workouts and gets me into shape faster than anything I own. There's a mixture of everything here - cardio/legwork, upper body toning, lots of abs and stretching. Cindy is there working alongside you and is very motivating. Her body is slim and toned yet curvy and is attainable instead of being intimidating.Everytime I lose motivation to work out, it only takes this one to get me going again - awesome workout which will get you incredible results in next to no time. I workout first thing in the morning before work and the last thing I need is loud, jarring music - the music is wonderful, motivating without being annoying.Get this workout now!"
5,Best Workout,"This is the best complete body workout ever! I always feel I have covered every muscle. Do this 1-2 times a week plus some other routine- running, cardio, gym,and you will be in shape!!! My abs still hurt and the arms are very toning."
2,Not so challenging im afraid...,"No i did not like this tape. I was surprised that it really wasnt that challenging as her first tape had me dripping w/sweat.there wasnt enough cardio and the arm work wasnt challenging at all. The only good part was the ab section that was actually a little hard for me. But again, her first tape is alot better, better music, better routines, everything."
5,A Great Work-out,"Whether your a suburban housewife, a never-been-married 39 year old woman or an aspiring athelete turned journalist like Kenny Smith, this workout video is for you. Yoga will make you feel special. Even if you don't work out while viewing this tape, it may encourage you to start working out...Cindy's sister is a regular looking lady."
4,If you want to sweat...you've come to the right place.,"I'm in fairly good shape. I work out at the gym 5-7 days a week. One day this winter when I couldn't get out of the house, I borrowed my roommate's copy of this workout. I sweated so hard I couldn't believe it! I was even more stunned the next day when I could feel how sore my muscles were! Cindy does a terrific job in this video. It is enough to stretch even the most fit person, but is slow and safe enough for someone who isn't so advanced. I highly recommend it, and am going to get a copy for myself now!"
4,Surprising results,"I picked this up out of my roommates collection of work out videos she had never touched. I was feeling a little chubby and needed to get a little activity so I decided to start doing it since I didn't want to pay for a gym membership for the winter months. I did it mostly so I wouldn't gain any more weight and kind of out of boredom. Well, my roommate started noticing the results before I did. I was about a size 8 before I started and within about 1 1/2 months I was down to a 4. I kind of had to laugh at it. My roommate was a bit upset cos she couldn't believe it actually worked. Pretty funny. So it's alright in my opinion. It's not a real hard work out, but it keeps your heart rate up. That is the key I think. I would suggest it to my friends."
5,Cindy Crawford - Next Challenge Workout,This is my favourite workout. It is great because engages all the body parts and at the end it has a relaxing stretch - very important part after every workout. This program tones and fits the body exactly in a way a healthy woman's body should be. I saw results immediately after the first time i did it. After couple of weeks working with the program my body felt and looked great. I have been using Cindy's workout for the last 10 years and it works!
5,THE BEST WORKOUT FOR YOUR ENTIRE BODY!,I HIGHLY recommend this DVD -Cindy Crawford - Next Challenge Workout.I totally felt the work I've done. YOU WILL SWEAT AND YOU WILL LOSE THOSE POUNDS!!! Of all Cindy's workouts this one is DEFINITLY worth having and working. LOVE IT !
5,Excellent Athletic Workout,An excellent athletic workout. A complete and challenging workout. I have used this workout during the winter months when I am not able to run and it prepares me for my first 5-K when the warm weather returns. I love the energy and the variety of this workout. I am not a very coordinated person and I hate aerobic workouts with all sort of dance steps therefore I am in love with this athletic workout. My VHS tape is in bad shape and I am so glad the DVD version is out.
4,Great strength workout,"I have used this workout to get in, and stay in, toned shape for many years. it is challenging. Highly recommended. Lots of squats, lunges, tons of crunches, weight training for arms. This is a total body shaper. Only drawback is it offers no cardio. Beginners will not wreck their knees with this program. Beginners can also work their way up to doing all the exercises. This is an intermediate/advanced program to get through it all. I got in the best shape of my life using this program. One drawback I found is you need to find the motivation yourself because Cindy doesn't encourage you to 'keep going'. The music is also dry. But if you want a straightforward, no nonsense, intense program; this is it. You will get the best abs of your life."
5,Total body workout,"I have had this workout since before DVD's, and its the best. I've bought others and this is still the best. Works the entire body; first a warm up, then cardio (legs), then series of abs, chest, arm and back exercises; all you need are a set of free weights. Plus you can grow with it; Cindy gives you encouragement by saying if you can't keep up at first, its ok, do what you can, and eventually you'll get stronger. What I think I like the best is its just you and Cindy (well, the trainer guy pop's his head in every once in a while). There are not a bunch of overly happy women showing different moves on one screen. It really is focused on exercise, not looks. Which might sound weird since its Cindy Crawford, but its true! Plus! there is a glossary at the end that goes over the moves that you could potentially hurt yourself, and goes over the correct way of performing the moves. What exercise DVD out there has that???"
5,Most fun and energizing video I've ever done.,"After a few weeks I felt strong, energetic, alive in a way a never felt from the many other videos I have worked out to. The routines are varied, fun, never boring. Great exercise video."
4,Good Tape,A very good workout tape that is realy challenging and I saw the results right away. Very good & effective for the abs & butt
4,the next challenge,"This is an excellent workout video. What I like best is that it targets the entire body. You're just not focusing on one area. However, I do think that she moves from one area into the other too quickly. She doesn't give you enough time to get ready.This can problem can be fixed by using your pause button on the video player."
2,Daughter was ready to throw this thing against a wall in 1 week,"My daughter was so excited to get this instead of the American Girl doll she originally wanted. We got it for her for Christmas a year or two ago and she played w/ it for 1 week before the doll got annoying. We all tried to answer the dolls questions, but she did not ""understand"" and kept repeating questions. After a while, the rubber on the face got distorted and she looked a bit scary.Nice concept, but not a product I would recommend."
3,Amazing not,This doll is very adorable but it does not hear all of your childs responses very well.My daughter who is 8 lost interest in it in about 2 hours.
5,I love Allysen!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am eight years old. My mom bought this toy yesterday and it is so fun!!!!!Once Allysen asked me ""What do you want to chat about?"" And I told her ""TV."" Then she said ""Ok lets watch a show. I'll be quiet while we watch the show."" When I finished, I squeezed her left hand. She woke up. Then she said ""To be honest, I kinda went to sleep."" This is so amazing!!!"
1,Amazing Allysen,"I am completely disappointed in Amazing Allysen. My daughter is 4 years old and she loves to play in her doll's hair. As soon as she tried to come Amazing Allysen's hair, it started coming out by the handfull. Needless to say my daughter has not picked up that doll since Christmas day. I even thought the doll was possibly defective, but I bought this doll with another person, and they had the same problem."
5,PIXEL HEAVEN!!!,"This is my second flat panel display - my first was the top-rated Eizo L330 15"" display - and that was fantastic. This screen's visual quality is EQUALLY as good (which is an excellent testament). BUT at 18.1"", I'm even more amazed at the image quality! I thought for sure that I would have to sacrifice some image quality - be it text or graphics - to get the additional real estate. But you know what??? All I did was GAIN with this baby!Much larger screen, more adjustable, swivel adjustment, dual inputs - an absolutely fantastic unit ALL around!!!If you can drop the $$$ for this piece, do it now and don't hesitate! AND do it with [Amazon.com] - they have the ABSOLUTE BEST customer service in the industry (trust me - I deal with A LOT of vendors).MAN I love this screen!-J"
5,Incredibly pleased!,"I tried a ""As Seen on TV"" pillow and it was garbage. Too few hulls and they were ground up. I had MORE neck pain than without it. I chose to make my own with a zippered pillow case from Kmart and 3 pounds of hulls from this guy. VERY SATISFIED!!! They arrived soon and as described. I have suggested my ""pillow"" to others as well. This is the cheaper way to go when making a hull pillow. Thanks!"
3,meh....,"The novelty of the slides wears off pretty quickly. It's interesting to see these ""slices of life"" from many years ago, but after awhile the book takes on the tediousness of any great aunt's slide show."
1,"Sorry, this book is a waste of money","You'd be better off buying a pack of postcards. Pictures are certainly NOT exuberant, lack good explanations, and are not relevant enough--I am a native Southern Californian and was bored and disappointed."
2,Unsuitable For Young Folks,This item is completely unsuitable for children under 8-10. The claw on the hammer is razor sharp. A nice little tool kit to have but CERTAINLY should not be given to children.
3,Insides Great - Outside Handle Weak,"I purchased this tool kit for my Granddaughter. Boy... have we had fun using the tools!! I have no complaints about the tools... they are child friendly and work well. My complaint is with the handle of the tool box. It is weak... when my Granddaughter lifted the box by the handle the box fell to the floor ~ so grateful it missed her and my feet! What good is a tool box when you can't carry it by the handle? My other ""complaint"" is the box that the tool kit comes in has only a boy pictured on it. Girls make great carpenters, too!!!"
4,Great toy,"This is a great toy! we bought it for my nephew. He wanted to feel like he was using ""real"" tools just like dad."
2,... Not really for learning proper English.,". . . If you want your child to read and write English properly, this is not the kind of book you want. It looks okay at first glance, but...It's really hard to describe/elaborate... The rhymes and lines ... It just isn't... right. (It's like... when you read a paragraph out of a book, and sometimes you have this feeling that things could've been worded differently to make it sound much better or something...) I've read a lot of weird rhymes from Dr. Seuss and other children's books... This one is just... it gives really ""off"" feeling.Don't get me wrong. I think the idea behind this book is really nice, and I do love eating bee bim bop, I bought it because I wanted my daughter to be exposed to different cultural stuff. But this definitely did not make it."
5,Delightful!,"I bought this book for my 15 month old grandson and it was a total hit! He loved the story and the pictures. Two days after we got the book, we had a family gathering and made Bee-Bim Bop for dinner, it was great! I love this book and highly recommend it!"
3,bee bim bop,"This fanciful poem captures the delight of a child as she helps her mother prepare a meal of bee bim bop. Park uses quatrains with a common rhyme scheme to assemble the aromatic rice, the fresh vegetables, golden eggs and savory strips of meat into a poem that expresses the child's anticipation of this traditional Korean dish. The watercolor and pencil drawings are charming. The artist and author have come to a satisfying collaboration in this book that will find a large audience among children regardless their heritage. At the end of the book are instructions on making the meal that includes a list of ingredients, step by step instructions, and precautionary warnings about using a knife and the stove."
5,"Wonderful, Rythmic Chidren's Book","I've been a fan of Linda Sue Park since her very first book. She has not missed with Bee-bim Bop! It's a cute story with the recipe in the back to show readers how they can make Bee-bim bop at home. If you have a love for Korean food and/or have young children, I highly recommend this book."
5,My kids love this book!,"I'm the mom to several kids adopted from Korea. We LOVE this book. It's fun to read, fantastic for the kids to interact with (my kids like to shout the ""Bee-Bim Bop!"" part when we get there!), and a great way to integrate a bit of Korean culture. I've read it to my kids' classes several times at school for Lunar New Year, and everyone always enjoys it. Just an overall great book!"
4,60's upside-downed Girl Group 90's!,"Madder Rose has a bunch of CDs available, cheap. They were a latter day girl group sound with an early/mid 90's sensibility and a shrug/wink towards the more popular so-called grunge sound. Belly, Frente, Breeders,Concrete Blond,etc. had a glorious period where they were adored and accepted as powerful players..This is an CD EP, the main reason is the understated sweetly sung version of the J5's,""Stop the Love You Save"". Definately worth the sugar silt on this pop donut."
3,Slightly curb my appetitte,I heard about this on Dr. Oz and decided to give it a try for the holidays because I have a tendency of eating and gaining more during this time. The product slightly curbed my appetite. I consistently took it about 1 hour before my usual time to eat. I also work out about 2-3 days a week and my eating habits are not too bad. Maybe if I continue to use it perhaps it will be more effective but I'm not one to take pills for a prolonged period of time so I doubt that I will order it again but it was worth a try and realize everyone may respond differently.
2,GENA IS NOT GOING TO MAKE YOU SLIM,I HAD BETTER EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS PRODUCT. DONT BUY IT. IT IS JUST ANOTHER PILL!

4,Best havana reference available in the US,"This is a great reference book for specific havana brands. Life sized images of most cigars from nearly all brands is included along with vitola information and author's tasting notes/suggestions. This is in addition to general cigar information like history of tobacco, tobacco cultivation and creating a cigar. The specific details are a bit dated (1997) but still the best I have seen published in the US. However, Min Ron Nee's text is superior if you can obtain it."
1,NONSENSE!!!,"Either Conason was in the throes of reliving the good old days of the Clinton/Gore Administration when he wrote this thing, or he decided to venture into the realm of Science Fiction. It is the left wing propaganda machine that has distorted the truth, which is what this book has done. The left has no proof whatsoever that George W Bush lied to anyone about anything, but the whole world knows that Clinton speaks with a forked tongue. He even admitted he lied. This book is just another example of the Left's hysteria due to the fact that they have lost all sense of reality and are losing their political power as well."
1,Left Wing Liberal Propaganda and the lying liars who tell em,"This book is another shining example of the unadulterated hatred the radical left wing liberals have for George W Bush. They complete deny anything that doesn't conform to their skewed, liberal lenses. Its quite shocking actually. The right wing propaganda machine this book speaks of is simply the market place determining whether talk show radio, specifically, conservative, will succeed. Why isn't there liberal talk shows? Because the market can't sustain them, unless its funded by taxpayers, ie NPR. My advice, take a pass on this book. Alan Combs has a much better book that takes a liberal viewpoint"
1,Laughable,"All one needs to do is watch the nightly news. There is a liberal, leftist spin to every story. Facts are left out, replaced with conjecture and attacks. the left can write all the books they want and have their radio network heard in all of two stations-- but the truth remains. According to the left, there is no such thing as free speech unless it promotes their ideas; there is no truth without their spin."
1,hes right,"Aside from CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, MSNBC, CSPAN, CNBC & NPR the liberal viewpoint has no where to be expressed."
5,Any story sounds good until you hear the other side,"Any story sounds good until you hear the other side. This is a teaching in the book of Proverbs. A wise man, one who is intelligent and does not want to be ignorant will consider both sides. Though basically a consesrvative myself, I found this book to be very interesting. The reading is smooth, thank God, meaning that the quality of writing is excellent. While I'm not convinced by every argument, I do come away feeling that I may have been a bit duped by the ""right wing"" nuts, not that I want to go over into the ""left wing"" nut camp. I just think I don't want to camp out with either side now. Well worth reading if you have an open mind. If you don't, then try reading it anyway and maybe it will open up a little."
4,If even half of Conason's allegations are true . . .,". . . the Neocon movement, and other Reactionary factions within the Republican Party have a lot of 'splaining to do. And I suspect that a lot more than half of the allegations are true. Particularly since he is citing an awful lot of hard facts, many of them from conservative sources.This book is every bit as fascinating as it is horrifying."
5,A must read for anyone who seeks the truth!,"I've read several books with similar themes recently. This book floats to the top everytime. With clarity and focus, Conason makes his case. It's a brilliant indictment of neo-conservatives. If you've been wondering what the hell happened to America, this is where you'll find out."
5,Equal parts fascinating and horrifying.,"If even a small fraction of Conason's allegations are true, the Far Right has ""a lot of 'splaining to do."" And those allegations are so well-documented that there are probably very few that AREN'T true. But be forewarned: this book is best taken in small doses, no more than a chapter a day, or else you may be too enraged and horrified to function.At the same time, the book is fairly well-balanced, acknowledging the faults of many on the Left and in the Center, although perhaps not quite as well-balanced as Brock's ""Blinded by the Right"" (which I also recommend). If there's a flaw in Conason's work, it would have to be his tendency to indulge what appears to be a personal vendetta against Nixon, that seems far out of proportion with anything he did."
2,No Substance Here,"John Moe says that Conason's book uses ""statistical evidence and detailed historical research"" to expose the lies of the right. I guess I am reading a different book. This thing is flimsy at best. In comparison, Franken's book looks like a medical journal in its use of supporting data.And the topics are pretty stale. One chapter is devoted to the ""fact"" that conservatives are ""always talking about family values."" While gay marriage is a current topic of debate, the family values issue seems quaint in light of the challenges currently facing this country.While Conason flails away at insignificant figures like Coulter and Hannity, the left is sinking into irrelevance. The liberal playground of California has become a global joke, and the Democrat candidates for president are pathetic. Maybe in his next book, Conason can figure out a way to blame Rush Limbaugh for that."
1,un-insightful,"This book is a waste of time and money. I purchased it to get an alternative perspective from my own ""conservative"" world view. This book comes off as a far-left, baseless slash at the right, which was intended to exploit the political hype of the day and show up on Google searches because of the term ""lies"" in the title..Unfortunately, it was a waste of my money and the time I took to begin reading it. Despite my desire to find an insightful look into the other world view by purchasing this book, I've decided to go ahead and invest my time in that other book I previously refused to purchase because the same terms in the title imply that it's irrational and un-objective, ... a fair and balanced look at the right..."
2,left wing mccarthyism,"If you are to believe this book, John Ashcroft, the Attorney General of the United States, knew about the Sept. 11 attacks, but did nothing, but cravenly protected himself. This is what Conason writes: ""[O]n July 26, 2001, Attorney General John Ashcroft abruptly stopped flyin on acommercial aricraft, reportedly due to a `threat assessment' by the FBI. The White House now claimws this had nothing to do with al-Qaeda and was related to concerns about a possible attempt against the Attorney General's life... Perhaps it is a sign of paranoia to ascribe grave meaning to any of those incidents. It is also apparent, however, that warnings and portents were flying around the globe in the months before Septemeber 11."" All inuendo. One gets the jist."
3,"Lots of great tid-bits, but just too nasty.","There is plenty of hypocrissy to go around on both sides of the political divide. The person who thinks that the other side is the only one housing morally corrupt scum, well, that person is an idiot. Conason ably points out a lot of the problems of the right, but he becomes just another left-wing version of repulsive people like Limbaugh, Hannity, Coulter, and O'Reilly. If something is wrong, don't become it - fight it!"
2,agitprop,"This book should have been co-authored by Sidney Blumenthal. It is yet another defense of Bill Clinton, partisan in tone, and agit-prop for the Democratic National Committee. That is bad enough, but its prose is barely readable!"
4,The Under Dog of Lost Reviews,"Any way this artical is about whats going on with the lack of coldplay music. Take my friends brother he hasn't even heard of the band Coldplay.I'm not the kind of person who just goes on about how great the band is, in fact it's not even my favorite band or song I'm just saying that it's time they were reconized for what they have done with there music. Their music videos are like nothing I've seen for a long time.so if your not sure if you want to buy this cd go to the music downloads and listen you might be suprized.Yours Truly,ixBrel rteeP"
1,"Cheap, says it all","I bought this as a replacement for the blown sub woofer in my bazooka. It fit well. Bass response was OK, for about 2 hours. Then it died. The bazooka is only rated at 150, max output power. I did end up buying the infinity product, it is awesome!!!"
4,eight inch replacement woofer.,"Good little woofer. I needed to replace a blown driver, and it needed to be four ohms, most are eight. The woofer sounds fine in my vintage eighties Infinity reference 2 speaker."
4,Reasonable Choice,"I bought this to replace a blown woofer in my 2002 Avalon. Good Speaker for the price. Don't expect it to be JBL. Did have to adapt the mount, but that isn't the speaker's fault. It is serviceable and reasonably priced."
4,good for the price,Definatly worth it. Good for the price. Not much thump but after messing with the EQ it sounds pretty good.
4,2000 Avalon replacement,"Purchased as a replacement for a 2000 Avalon. Don't expect the same sound as the original JBL and you should be satisfied. Sounds underpowered, well because it is. But for <$20 including shipping I don't really think you can beat it. I will probably end up repairing the original, but this gives me plenty of time to procrastinate. Just make sure to take the time to desolder and resolder the leads rather than trying to splice them, unless you want to lose more power."
3,Just OK for Expedition,"I bought this to replace the factory sub woofer that failed; you cannot get the factory sub anymore. It required holes to be drilled (came with six and box had eight), but the depth was fine and required no other modification to fit. The sound with the factory amp is just OK. The factory magnet was heavier, so I am thinking that is part of the problem."
1,sub woffer,"i ordered this item about two months ago and after about a month it just stopped working and i want a new one for free because it shouldn't just stop working, there is no visible damage."
1,Didn't last long,"It didn't last long. Two times in a pool and it started leaking air. I got it as a gift for my nephew, so it was embarrassing."
4,Insufficiently Fresh,"Essentially, this IS the ""Forty Years"" offering plus an extra CD for the past decade. Considering the plethora of gems, especially live music, that must (please God) still be available in the archives, this set is a disappointment to owners of ""Forty Years"". Of course, its still Tony Bennett, arguably the greatest interpreter of American popular standards, there's lots of music, and the selections are generally solid. However, the sound quality is a bit uneven at times and grossly under-represents his live contributions (shockingly, Carnegie Hall 1962 is still the only all-live generally available recording from his first three decades of output). Still, this collection is the definitive take on Mr. Bennett's musical life work to date. Tony Bennett...long may he live."
3,Disappointed,"No complaints with the qulity of the recordings. The first CD in the set is really wonderful, because I love crooners. After that, his style was changed a great deal by what I think of as popular competition with other rock singers and I don't care for the singing nearly as much. Having said that, this is just my personal taste, so other people might be very pleased with the whole set."
1,Not worth it.,I don't think that this book is any better than the mathematics fundamentals covered in Kaplan or Princeton Review.It is a waste of time and money.Atleast they could have given numerous questions to practice.
1,DO NOT BUY,"I have an engineering background and I strongly suggest others with a similar one not to buy this book. I could complete this book and all of its 'exercises' in an hour. All it does is repeats very basic math knowledge which I bet you will not forget even after 50 years from now. All in all bad book for GMAT Equations, Inequalities, & VIC's preparation. Now I have look for ways to sell this book which I bought two days ago... any buyers? not a scratch on the paper and is all in mint condition."
1,Bootleg,Don't buy it. Very poor sound quality. JL Pierce wouldn't want this cd to be sold! Buy the cd 'Live in Europe' / 'Ahmeds wild dream' for a great live recording.
5,A FANTASTIC FIND FOR ALL BRUCKNERIANS!!!,"If you love Bruckner--(as I do)--you'll be thrilled with this new disc. It's on the MD&G gourmet label--(which, queerly enough, Amazon lists as ""MP&G"" [!]). It's a 1920s arrangement of the 7th for chamber ensemble (with harmonium!). It's fantastic. This is just the type of arrangement which was done for Schoenberg's post-WWI Society for the Private Presentation of Music wherein avant-garde pieces for large orchestra were reduced for chamber performance. See also Bruckner's 3rd for piano duet arranged by Mahler (also on MD&G--""MP&G"")."
2,Alert: there is version confusion,"added note: Bruckner lovers! Navigate to hear the chamber ensemble version done by the Linos Ensemble. Praise to the Algorithm for suggesting it.there is an error -- a Bruckner 7 with francophonie canadian is merged with this version, the Thomas Christian Ensemble -- somebody named Christian leads that -- I am being approximate because one cannot look at the actual page and write the review at the same time, so who can remember?i thought maybe there was an error, and that the wrong Bruckner 7 was hitched to these links. This is no chamber ensemble to my ears, although very pretty. But, the same sounds are at iTunes as here, and the slow movement is by far the slowest or longest on record - and I have almost every record. The timing is 24 minutes - many are 18. Maybe this is the only performance that takes every repeat -- but the pace sounds very slow."
3,Inspire your kids,"This is a kid's book that explains you always have something to write about, even if you think your life is boring and plain. The book gives you ideas of things to write about like the moldy overdue book in the corner, and how your grandmother cracks her knuckles. The illustrations depict kids of various cultures putting their lives to paper in fun ways."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this book to use in my 6th grade writing class to help inspire kids to write about everyday life. I am very disappointed & will probably not use it at all. The scenarios are very elementary & the way to persuade young writers is not like this. I get the point of the book, but it's not practical for kids who are already reluctant to write."
1,Why spend this much??,"Why on earth would anyone spend $240 on the six seasons when you can buy each season indidually for $140?? Even taking into account the fact that season 3 is split into two DVD's, it is about $100 less than the ""box set"". I am not sure if the set includes something really great that is not mentioned, but it doesn't appear that is the case."
4,A gift for me on my birthday,I was real pleased with the service I got when their was a problem with one of the discs. I was pleased with the prompt delevery on the origanal order and on the correction that need to be made.
2,Not what I expected,"I got this CD because I thought it would have the version of Classical Gas that was in this movie. I was really let down. The rest of the CD was ok, but it didn't have the song I thought it would. The version I was looking for had both Mason Williams on guitar, and other instruments in the background. This is not that song. This is just Mason by himself.So here is a warning to anyone looking for the same song that was in both the preview and the movie: THIS IS NOT THE SONG YOU ARE LOOKING FOR!"
3,Finally found it!,"While Aaron was disappointed with the version of Classical Gas that appeared on the Soundtrack, it was exactly the version I was looking for. I am a classical guitarist and I love Mason Williams song Clasical Gas, but I wanted to hear it without the orchestral arrangement to improve my playing of it. As for the rest of the soundtrack -Its OK, some nice soft guitar but I am not a great fan of Eric Clapton's soundtrack style. I would never see the film unless it was to earn brownie points with the wife - ie. chick flick. You can get the original of Mason William's Classical Gas by searching at Amazon. That is where I bought it.Matt"
3,An Eric Clapton CD with 2 songs that don't belong,"This is a good CD--I read the other reviews before purchasing it. The ""Classical Gas"" track is not the same as the one used in the movie, but still enjoyable. I do not like the tracks that have somebody humming along with the instrumental--it is annoying. Also, the Teddy Wilson song & the Andrews sisters song I could do without. Basically the CD is comprised of the main track by Eric Clapton repeated in different length snippets. Since I like Eric Clapton, I liked the mellow guitar instrumentals. Except for skipping a couple of the tunes you can enjoy the whole thing straight through."
5,completed collection,Added to extensive Clapton collection. Now have EVERYTHING he has recorded after many years of searching and buying. Good quality CD.
2,Poor poor and Poor,This was a mistake on my part even thinking of buying it. It made me purchase every song separately and compilemy own soundtrack. Pfui
5,This book is a gem for readers,"I purchased this book as soon as learned it came out. I even wrote the author and he replied.It is a great book on British army and naval small arms of the colonial period.Unfortunately it appears he has not come out with the other two books of the planned series. British Military arms in North America, which might have included the Dutch and Commercial Military arms the British also issued Colonial forces. And the final all incllusive British Military Small Arms 1689-1815.None the les, for those interested in weapons of the period, this book is a must."
5,"Hello, my name is Andy and this soundtrack is so good!","When I first heard that Jim Carrey was going to play Andy Kaufman, I could'nt wait! Then I saw the movie trailer, I could'nt wait! During the Trailer they played the R.E.M. song ""Man On The Moon"" and just kind of fell in love with it on many repeat viewings of the trailer! Then I saw the Poster and Saw that R.E.M. was doing the music for the complete movie, I could'nt wait for the soundtrack! I knew they would do great music and I was hoping the Song would be on there! All my dreams came true! I love all the songs on this soundtrack album and I think the Dialog is great! I am so amazed at how great the score sounds, it's better than I imagined! As I listen to this Album over and Over, I know that it won't just be a great movie, but One of the best movies ever made! Hello, my name is Andy and this is the soundtrack for you!"
3,"REM Rocks, the rest are OK","The soundtrack to Man on the Moon has some really good REM songs, The Great Beyond is easily the best song on the CD. Though The Great Beyond, Man on the Moon, and This Friendly World are good, the rest are mostly instrumental, which unless you like that stuff, isn't really all to great. Though I almost forgot to mention, Tony Clifton's version of ""I Will Survive"" is hilarious! Overall, if you like REM this is a good CD, if you don't, I wouldn't waste my time."
5,"More ""Moon"" please","I thought that the CD was great, but I think that the song ""Man On The Moon"" should be included in the audio for this web site, so that people that don't have the CD can experience how awesome that song is. Other than that, the web site was fun and the CD is GREAT!"
3,Eh...,"Six of one, half a dozen of the other. Several songs are enjoyable (""Man on the Moon"", ""Great Beyond"", Exile's ""Kiss you all Over"") and many of the little novelties included are much appreciated (themes from ""Mighty Mouse"" and ""Taxi"", Tony Clifton performing ""I will Survive""). But R.E.M.'s score feels a bit generic, the bits of film dialogue are kind of unnecessary, especially considering the train wreck of a script, and the orchestral version of ""Man on the Moon"" is just embaressing.And hey, why isn't Andy's A capella wrestling fanfare included?"
4,Dats a Great CD!,"I have bought this Cd and listened to it over and over again. I am not the biggest Andy fan, but the CD is great. The music put on this CD is a great combination of R.E.M and other great artists."
4,They did it again,"""The Great Beyond"" is a gorgeous song, one that ranks with R.E.M.'s best work. Once again, Stipe proves what a great lyricist he is with the line ""I'm tossing up punch lines that were never there"". No fan of the band was happy over the departure of Bill Berry, but R.E.M has really reinvented itself since, and they just keep getting better."
3,"Good Album, for the most part","Hey, lemme start out by saying that I'm open to almost all kinds of music. Overall, this was a very good album. I love ""Great Beyond"", ""Man on the Moon"", and ""Friendly World"". However, the ""Taxi"" theme song, I could do without. I did like the recordings of the real Andy singing, and Tony Clifton's ""I Will Survive"" is hilarious. Although I love REM, some of the orchestrations were a bore to sit through, but it was for a movie, so I can let that slide. Overall though, this is worth your buck if you like REM."
3,"I am a huge R.E.M. fan, but this CD just does not flow","Just buy the CD single the Great Beyond, and save the rest of your money. I love R.E.M., and I admidt the score is nice, but it just is not a good CD all and all. It needs a better flow from song to song, and its missing, its terrible to listen to from begining to end. The Great Beyond is a fantastic track, worth having on a single, but otherwise this CD is a little dry..."
2,Major disappointment,"I was very disappointed in this album. I couldnt believe that REM was actually going to score a film! I had heard some REM instrumentals and I couldnt wait to hear what they would deliver on this score. Upon getting the CD, I realized that not only are there only 4 or 5 tracks of REM score, but that 1) they are only around 45 seconds long each 2) some of the tracks have dialogue over them, and 3) the instrumentation does not span farther than a piano and strings. I was hoping for some ambient soundscapes with great strange guitars and percussion. But it sounds just like an everyday film score. It's pretty, and the new single ""The Great Beyond"" is one of the only great tracks on the album. But if you were hoping for something original and incredible, you're gonna be let down in a major way. sam smith / ApclpseBoy@aol.com"
2,A score by REM? The only highlights are REM's own stuff!,"I love R.E.M., I really do. Therefore I bought `their' score of the brilliant movie Man On The Moon, after hearing their single The Great Beyond. This score also features the classic R.E.M. song Man On The Moon, as well as an orchestral version. A very nice bonus. This Friendly World is another R.E.M. song, a very sweet one with guest vocals by Jim Carrey (as Andy Kaufman and his alter ego Tony Clifton). Sadly, these songs are this score's only highlights. The rest of the album sounds very boring to me. Surely R.E.M. could have done a better job making a score for a brilliant movie like this. Sadly, they failed. But this score is definitely a nice collector's item for R.E.M. fans. If you're not a fan, I recommend to spend your money on something better. (Tip: Try a Radiohead album...)"
2,The Greatest Band of the 80's limps out of the 90's,"Perhaps the euphoric, but problematic recording process for UP took to much from there sails, because this is a weak entry into their cataloge. R.E.M has released stellar music from day one, rarely missing the mark. However, this after-thought of a recording is nothing more then a over-priced re-issue of the great title track, orchestral recordings that could have been composed by any unemployed studio hack, lame movie clips and what sounds like the result of a long, alcohol drenched day in the studio. At least its shorter then the last two superior, albeit flawed, lps.Uninvolved and uninspired, lets hope next spring's lp will find Athens' favorite sons back in step."
4,If The Great Beyond were the only good song...,"OK, so I haven't heard the album, yet. But even if The Great Beyond was the only good track on it, and all the others sucked (which, by the ones I know, they don't), it would rate at least a 4.This is perhaps the greatest R.E.M. song in a decade, and is absolute proof that either they still have it, or had just one last great song in them."
5,Wonderful!,"I've always been a big fan of Andy Kaufman and R.E.M. and the combination of these things are just perfect! It opens with the great classic ""Man on the Moon"" from the 1992 album ""Automatic For The People"". The second track features ""The Great Beyond"" which is a beautiful song. Jim Carrey joins Michael Stipe in the song ""Our Friendly World"". Fun! Bob James' 1978 Taxi theme ""Angela"" is also on this album. ""The Mighty Mouse Theme"" too. And of course ""I Will Survive"" sung by Jim Carrey (as Andy Kaufman/Tony Clifton). If you like great music, you will like this soundtrack! Go out there and buy it now!"
4,This c.d. is swell.,"The c.d. has a fabulous new REM song (""the great beyond"") and some neat sound tracks from the movie. The score is unbelievable; while listening to some of the orchestral tracks, I thought to myself, ""Stipe wrote that?"" If you're an REM fan who is just looking for some new songs, save money by buying the ""Great Beyond"" single. But, if you've seen the movie, this c.d. is a great way to remember it. If you get the chance to buy it used, you should definately take it. And you might even buy it new. I think it was worth my money. Some other hi-lites from the soundtrack include a song featuring Stipe, Kaufman, and Klifton (hilarious) as well as a sound-byte from the very first Saturday Night Live. If you buy the album, I'm sure you will agree--this c.d. is swell."
4,wonderful,"I have to admit that I am actually a fan of punk rock, like Blink 182 or Green Day or Lit, but I love the song ""The Great Beyond"" It is an enormously inspirational song that anyone would enjoy. If you liked ""Losing My Religion"", then you will probably also like ""The Great Beyond"" and the rest of this soundtrack."
5,Breathtaking!,"Unlike many reviewers, I was not familiar with much of Richard Thompson's work before ""Mock Tudor."" I bought the CD because I heard Terry Gross interview Thompson on ""Fresh Air,"" and I was impressed with the interview and audio clips from the album. Maybe that's an advantage, judging by some comments here, because I find ""Mock Tudor"" nothing short of stunning. The songwriting and musicanship are remarkable, and the production is perfectly suited to the music (witness the way ""Cooksferry Queen"" changes mood and builds in tempo and intensity, for example). The songs here are laden with musical and lyrical hooks, but at the same time the music is subtle and sophisticated, and the album has only become more intriguing with repeated listening. I'm truly amazed that Richard Thompson is not better known and more appreciated than he is. Maybe ""Mock Tudor"" will change that."
1,Pretty basic...,This is rough and ready music with a hard-nose seamy side like chopper music melodramatic and somewhat crude in tone.
2,What a disapointing and dull album,"After seeing several fine performance on YouTube and hearing Mirror Blue,I was really looking forward to this one. Ufff, what a bummer it turned out to be. All the songs are similarly lame and pedestrian. The melodiesare definitely towards the boring side, and there's nothing on hear that's catchy or complex (Crawl under my Stone coming the closest). And Richard, for Gods sake stop crying incessantly about lost love. Every freaking song, my god. Get a mail order bride from Russia with love or something. Uff! Huge let down. Listened once and trashed."
2,Not his best by any stratch,"I bought Mock Tudor, played it, didn't like it and put it away. A couple of bits hung around, and I decided to give it a serious listen. In preparation I played ""Beeswing"", ""Walking on a Wire"", ""Calvary Cross"" and ""Can't Win"" (the version on ""Watching the Dark""). I also listened to some ""Eagles"" who, like Richard, take a darker view of things, and with whom Richard was offered a place.The result of this session is I don't think much of ""Mock Tudor"".Too many tunes seemed to include those flattened (I'm sure deliberately) notes. And that plunking bass was a great distraction. Together they give a murky, dirty messy sound. But worse is that he seems now to be outside the music, whereas earlier he lost his senses in it.I think the affair is over. Thirty years isn't a bad run - so many great songs, so many memories"
5,Thank God Mitchell Froom didn't ruin this one,"I was so pleased Richard finally jettisoned Mitchell Froom and his horrible production. Though every Thompson album is a gem, he seems to release an out and out masterpiece every 4 or 5 albums(Shoot out the Lights, Daring Adventures, Rumour and Sigh) Well finally we have the Thompson masterpiece for the late 90's. The new producers, Rothrock and Schnapf seem to understand the subtleties of Thompson's music way better than Froom. Instead of bludgeoning the listener, the nuances of the songs shines through. Thompson's concept album about growing up in London is a thrill to hear. ""Sights and Sounds of London Town"" is as good as Thompson gets and ""Crawl Back"" is a great rock song. They're all good. Pick up Mock Tudor."
3,Worth buying if only for three great songs,"After a string of six or seven consecutive great albums, it sounds like Richard is coasting a bit with ""Mock Tudor."" There is nothing unpleasant or obviously wrong with the album. Though it shows a man at the height of his songwriting craft, Thompson enthusiasts expect a bit more than mere skill. I miss the darker and more mature themes he dipped into on ""You? Me? Us?"", a sadly underrated album. Of course, the quirky darkness I love surfaces perhaps three times on ""Mock Tudor""--namely, on ""Uninhabited Man,"" ""Sights and Sounds of London Town,"" and on the brilliant ""Hope You Like the New Me."" It may be the album was intended as a showcase for those three incredible songs. I certainly don't dismiss the rest, but I know he can do much better."
5,The best Richard Thompson record yet,"Richard has shaken off the abysmal ""Industry"" and done some serious work. Apart from the final track, which is an intelligent and interesting poem sung without a tune, all the tracks are good musically, with some excellent lyrics. Several are stunning - his most mature and assured compositions yet. ""Bathsheba smiles"" and ""That's all, Amen, close the door"" are set to become classics, with several others close behind them. If you like Richard, just buy it becuase you'll love it. If you don't like Richard, buy it because you might after hearing it. My wife couldn't stand his stuff - this has converted her."
2,Quite the disapointment,"Despite a few good songs I think this is one of Thompson's weakest albums in many, many years. I was particularly irritated by the production values of this album - it was by far too much sounding like the typical over-produced, percussion heavy rock and roll of today. While Thompson is often a brilliant writer and an extrodinary player these virtures were lost in the mix. Why of why does he seem to want to sound like all the rest? Ignore this and get an earlier album of Thompsons (such as Mirror Blue or Across a Crowded Room or the 3 CD respective of a few years back)you'll be a lot happier!"
4,RT Newbie,"Hadn't ever given RT a chance, but heard Crawl Back last Friday, and had this CD on Saturday morning. I can't believe I've been missing out on such a talent all this time. Looking forward to checking out the older stuff!"
4,Latest from one of Rock's better singer-songwriters,"Richard Thompson is considered to be one of the better singer-songwriters by other musicians. Thompson was originally with Fairport Convention and for years recorded CD's with his wife, Linda. As a songwriter, he is best known for ""Dimming of the Day"" which was recorded by Bonnie Riatt as well as a host of others. On his latest outing, Thompson rocks a little more than usual. This is a very good CD from a very good artist, so discover for yourself why Richard Thompson is so highly regarded in rock music circles. When listening, try ""Two Faced Love"" (tr#4), ""Crawl Back"" (tr#6), ""Dry My Tears and Move On"" (tr#8), and ""That's All, Amen, Close the Door"" (tr#11)."
5,something for everyone?,"I've been a fan of Richard's since the early days of Fairport's 'Meet on the Ledge' but I'd be the first to admit that, at times, he can be a bit of a gloomy bugger. Over his last few albums his old sense of humour returned and as he showed in last years excellent 'Industry' album with Danny Thompson he can even write a catchy tune or three. From the opener 'Cooksferry Queen' this is an 'up' album with Dave Mattocks, brilliant as ever, driving things along - Ry Cooder move over! Quite how you classify an album like this is anyone's guess, bits of english country dance, rockabilly, folk, country, I swear I could even detect a drum n' bass influence, a la Eliza Carthy. Stripped down, but not as sparce as some of his work, for me this is his best solo offering. Maybe it's because I'm a Londoner but I just can't stop humming 'The sights and sounds of London Town' to myself, maybe not Robbie Williams but Richard Tompson on top form. Pass the Prozac!"
4,Husband likes his gift,My husband is a train buff so he was very happy with his Christmas gift. He says the material is comfortable.
2,too narrow,"I normally wear a 7M, I bought Clarks shoes before and they are very confortable, but this one is a little bit narrower than it's normal sizes. and The ankle is too wide."
5,A Very Satisfied Customer,I Ordered a John Wayne Collectors Framed Photo. I was very happy with it. It looked just like the picture and the bio on John Wayne was very informative. It came on time and I could track it easily on the site. I will be purchasing more thngs from Amazon.com in the future.
4,This IS fun!!!,"If you enjoy hearing a big band live that is having fun with what they're doing, then listen to this one! Al Grey plays some solos that gets everyone going, including Baise responding with ""yeah!"" more than once. And the vocal ""I Hate You Baby"" is emotional fun itself, with the Joe Williams baritone sound-alike."
1,False advertising,"Seems like a good idea, right? Who wouldn't want a faceplate with a picture of your dog or cat or kid or car or whatever? When you actually get on their site to design your personal faceplate, you can't upload your own photos (that feature has been ""coming soon"" for months now), and the stock graphics that are available range from flames to tribal tattoos to dragons. If I were a 14 year old boy with no immagination, maybe I'd be satisfied, but I'm not. The worst part is that there are so many great designs printed on the package, none of which you can actually make with this product. It would have been much more satisfying to smoke the $30."
1,DO NOY BUY! Product is useless!,There is no longer any Pelican support for this product. Anyone who has purchased this product is stuck with a useless piece of plastic and paper. Those of us waiting for the feature to import personal images just got screwed out of our money. At least anyone buying one now would have spent less than I did.Pelican Accessories Pelican PL-3691 Personalized Faceplate for Xbox 360
3,Not worth the $,We bought this doll for our 5 year old for Christmas and she is not all that amazing. Her hair is falling out all over the place and one of her cheeks have peeled off (the coloring). There can not be any background noise while she is in use. My daughter seemed to really like her a lot and played with her the first few days. Since the excitement has diminished things have changed. She has not picked her up in about a week. I don't think I would purchase this doll again.
2,help,"ok i bought this doll for my daughter she wanted from santa. Had to take the first doll and exchange it, it would not wake up and her face was really messed up and the skin color was too, so she must have been a defect, so we got a second and we cannot get it passed January to get the times set up urrrrr..... it is dec. 31st and we still dont have a working doll not worth the anxiety, but when santa brought it it was worth the excitement in our daughter......... she had other things to think about so she really didnt miss this one. I hope i can talk her into the barbie dream house or something else!!!"
1,Annoying Allysen,"Complete waste of money! I bought this for my 5yr old daugther and there is no way possible for her to program it! After several frustrating attempts we finally get it programed. Now the darn thing does not respond to her answers. Even when I clearly repeat the answer in her ear she does not seem to register. Complete waste of Money!!!! Would not recommend to anyone! Save your money and play with a rock, much more fun!"
2,It didn't last three months...,"Despite numerous battery changes, Allysen died a rather frightening death. First she made some really scary faces, then she just stopped, her face frozen in one of the rather creepy faces. Yes, she was somewhat fun for my daughter while she lasted, although her sensors didn't work very well. We constantly had to repeat commands, etc., and she would just say, ""Wha...?"" Also, Allysen has a rather limited range of subjects. She'll talk about her cell phone calls, hair styles, and parties. Hmmm... remind you of anyone?Also, unlike a computer connected talking Winnie the Pooh that came out about five years earlier, Allysen can NOT learn your child's name. She has about four or five ""nicknames"" from which your child may pick.All in all, I would recommend the doll ONLY if you can find it at about 1/5 its normal resale price, and ONLY if your child is not prone to nightmares in the event that the toy malfunctions."
1,PAIN IN THE REAR AND NOT MUCH FUN!,"I bought this for my 6 year old daughter last year for Xmas and I thought it was really cool. The first doll lasted about two weeks and stopped ""listening"" so we brought home Doll #2. After getting frustrated with the lack of voice recognition, my 6 year old tossed her aside and my 3 year old began playing with her because she liked her hair. Of course even after reset, my youngest got tired of Allysen. The eyes began to malfunction and the rubber face is now distorted and stained. And the beautiful hair began to mat and fall out-finally her head popped off during a brush and she was tossed in a box until I can get someone to replace her with another ""Amazing"" product. Maybe another one will hold my girls' attention...but I'm not holding my breath."
1,not the best doll made,"I bought this doll on clearance for $20 and it was played with maybe twice. She is a very mature doll, more like a teenager. It may have been a good idea to try to get an older version of Amazing Amanda, but this one isn't it. Teenagers don't like to play with dolls and this doll has a cell phone, magazine, a smoothie or something to drink,etc. Little girls liek to play with dolls and they need little girl or baby dolls to play with, not teenagers. I don't like this doll and neither did my 6 year old. She wanted to play with my other daughter's amazing Amanda (a lot cuter). Allyson has a hard time understanding what you want her to do. I don't think she was worth the $20."
4,Not so Amazing Allysen,"My 7 year old little sister wanted A.Allysen ever since she was brodcased on TV. When she did get the doll, she wanted to set her up right away. she thought it would be easy. Turns out, A.Allysen was really, really hard to set up. Allysen thought it was March 3rd when it was really March 22nd! She has a hard time following directions, like, she thinks ""Allysen"" is ""Call a Friend"". She gets answers(yes, no, okay, sure) mixed up. Allysen is a little bossy. A.Allysen is sometimes fun to play with, but she is a bit annoying. I do not reccomend buying her."
1,Not So Amazing Allysen,"I read some of the negative reviews of Amazing Allysen, but chose to ignore them. I should have listened! Right after we got the doll out of the box, big clumps of her hair fell out. Her face looks very different from the beautiful picture advertised. After we programmed her, she kept getting confused and responding incorrectly to our requests. We were very disappointed in the doll and decided to send it back."
2,Annoying Allysen,This doll is very difficult to program. The child (or adult)must speak very loudly to be recognized by the doll. It repeats the same phrases over and over.
3,Allysen: somewhat over-rated!,"I had read the reviews on Allysen and decided she was still a good choice for our six-year old daughter. The concept of Allysen is very good. But, she was just about impossible to program properly. Frankly, this should be a very easy process... but, the prompts from Allysen were just not working. Allysen has some very fun features. For example, her ""friends"" sometimes call on her cell phone or you can play a game in which she guesses what animal you are thinking of. My daughter likes her enough and I am sure will be played with on occasion. I was hoping for something a little more fun for the $100 price tag. Personally, I think she is over-priced and over-rated!"
1,AMAZING ALLYSEN DOLL,"I am not happy with the product which is why I am sending it back! When I received the doll the battery pack was not included, and I am assuming this is what is needed to make the doll interact. This was a ""Santa gift"" for my daughter, so now she pretty much knows there is now such thing as Santa, thanks for that! I told her I would send it back to Santa's workshop for some repairs and hopefully you can send me the correct one with ALL of it's parts. I am not unhappy with Amazon at all because they were very helpful and very quick to respond. I was able to do everything online & able to return it at no charge to me. I needed to speak to a customer service rep. ,so I put my # in and someone returned my call immediatly. I thought that was great. As for the doll just make sure next time that all the parts are included. Especially if it is around christmas time."
2,Allysen is very limited,"My 7 year old daughter got Amazing Allysen Christmas last year, and the doll did not hold her attention for very long. After a tedious set up process, she talks to your child and plays interactive games, but the games are very simplistic guessing games that get old very quickly. The doll is not a good toy for sharing with friends. She is easily confused when more one person talks. Also, if my daughter forgets to pay attention Allysen for a few days, she needs to be set up all over again.My daughter even has the three clothing playsets, and the doll still just isn't that interesting."
2,Not-So-Amazing Allison,"While I was on vacation, my parents were joking aroung to me about this doll who used to call me Pickles. They said it was about 5 years ago when I fell in love with a doll who said first to me, ""What do you want me to call you? Okay Pickles!"" We said in the pool going, the name was an adjective and then a girl's name. Then they said that the first word was Amazing. Then the doll entered my mind: ""Amazing Allison!"" I blurted out. My parents congratulated me as I remembered everything. A purple shirt, and...Allison: ""Let's play a game!""Me: ""Okay!""Allison: ""What do you want to play?""Me: ""Truth or dare!""(Amazing Allison does nothing)Pretty doll, but doesn't work too well. Ah, memories!"
1,Please do not buy this doll,"I rarely review - I wanted to like this doll so much. My daughter has had for 2 years now. We take it out every few months or so and Try again to make it work. It never worked. It is such a good concept with a terrible outcome.Please, do not waste your money. Mostly, do not set your daughter up for disappointment. The reviewers who have listed it above a 2 simply must have gotten the Rare doll by this manufacturer that works.My daughter is 10. It is not an age issue, or speech pattern issue. The doll simply does not work.We got both the Amazing Allison and Amazing Amanda from Etoys years ago and both were to say the least, an incredibly frustrating experience for us all."
1,Horrifying Christmas Experience,My aunt and uncle bought this doll for my little sister last Christmas. It survived only long enough to demonstrate the shallow values that I hope that my little sister does not choose to emulate. The doll was constantly preoccupied with its cell phone and its smoothis. The guessing games it played were so simplistic that they didn't hold my little sister's attention. It also seemed to refer to everyone and everything that made noise as 'cupcake' or something similarily annoying. I do not reccommend this product.
4,Amazing doll,"I bought the doll today for just $[...] at TJ Maxx as I thought why not buy it as it was very cheap. When we set it up at home, we had no problem setting it up at all. I was just amazed by her mouth movement and how much she talks. My daughter is four and half years old and enjoyed her but after awhile she wanted the doll to stop talking so we told the doll to take a break, she obediently went to take a nap. I thought that was amusing so I think we will enjoy Allysen in the long run and besides, she was just $[...] so I have nothing to complain about if anything fails with the doll."
1,my hands hurt,"Cool concept and my 7 yr old likes her ok but the set up is TEDIOUS and annoying. After both me and my husband taking turns squeezing her left hand till our hurt we finally got a set of pliers and used that to squeeze. This doll has trouble understanding our words and to reset the neck name it says to squeeze both hands for 10 seconds so pliers in hand we attempted this and low and behold allyson fell asleep so my daughter in annoyingly called ""pickles"" i mean what the heck!!!! I only paid 20.00 for this doll including 3 of her acessory packs so i dont feel to bad but she is barely worth that price. Buy a baby annabell instead"
3,"Amazing, when it works...","I bought this for my 7 year old's birthday. We just unpacked the 3rd one after returning 2 to the store. The first one worked for an hour, but then wouldn't wake up again. The second one came with the switch in her left hand broken from the getgo (which you need to squeeze to program and turn her on). My daughter loved it from the first minute she started playing with it. It really is quite an interactive companion that my daughter fully engages in conversation.I just hope this one lasts..."
1,think twice,"We bought this for our 5 year old. She was beyond excited. Once we opened the packaging, which was quite time consuming. The doll did not work right. When she talked her eyes were closed and when she slept her eyes were open. We returned her, got a new one. kid played with that one for 1 day. Amazing Allysen's bottom lip became so distorted when she talked that it looked gross, the rubber was soo loose that that you had to mess with it after each time she talked to fix it. You also has to say the same thing 5 times before the doll recognized what you were saying. Needless to say the kid lost interest and thought she looked gross, so after the 3rd day, we returned her for good. Think twice about this doll unless you like having a disappointed kid and opening repeated dolls that are packaged like they are going to the moon."
1,Waste of money!,"I hate this doll! She is difficult to program, eats batteries and the tags which must be plugged into her body do not like to stay attached. Within a week her hair was a matted mess, it took me an hour to brush out the tangles and is now braided. I would not recommend this doll to anyone. With all the frustration this doll has caused I would love to turn it into a shooting target!"
3,She's a bit sassy and complicated,"My 7 yr old daughter really wanted this doll. It took a bit of effort and reading to get started with the doll. She says ""girlfriend"" alot and is on the sassy side--to the point my daughter doesn't like to play with her very much. She was a bit hit for a little while, but then got on my daughters nerves and that was the end of it. It was interesting how she sang a christmas carol once we'd programmed in the date. She has some interesting features, but a bit too difficult for a 7 yr old."
1,Disappointing doll.,"Our daughter has asked for this doll for months. It was the one thing she really wanted for Christmas. It worked the first day only and has not since. We are returning it tonight - it took some time for her to make that decision on her own. She was convinced it would wake up again and this was the first real disappointment she has had with wanting something that was not what it was supposed to be. :) We know 2 other people who got this doll and have also returned it. From not programming (we had to hold that button on the hand so hard that my fingers were hurting!!!), to not waking up, to just being annoying in how much the doll talks about fixing her hair. The idea of this doll was great...the reality of it in our experience was not good at all. Maybe they will work some kinks out so that eventually the doll will work well, will not be so difficult to set/change activites (if an adult can barely press the hand, how can a child??)."
2,kinda frustrating especially for the amount of $,"We had trouble setting her up. The button in her hand you have to press is very difficult and she has a little trouble understanding. It's like talking to those stupid automated phone systems. We nick-named her the Amazingly Annoying Allysen. She still doesn't have the date or my daughter's birthday right. Once we got through the set-up the girls have had fun with her, but they get frustrated by her when she doesn't understand and they end up yelling at her. Yeah...she definately needs some improvements. I wouldn't have bought her, but my daughter had her heart set on her. If you're going to spend this kind of money on a doll, buy an American Girl doll. You can get them to look like your daughter, and they are extremely well made (they have great hair that doesn't get all matty--my oldest daughter has one). Plus American Girls don't limit the play by the phrases they are programmed to say. I am a bit disappointed in ""Amazing"" Allysen."
4,"Fun toy, could be better though","My 7 year old daughter was beyond excited to receive this toy. The thing that frustrates my daughter is that she has to yell into the dolls face for the doll to hear her. She repeats herself over and over and then tires of it and puts the doll ""for a break"". Our doll also tells us she is cold and to dress her. When she is already fully dressed. I assume this is a glitch with the sensors. Overall, it is a fun toy, but I still don't think it is worth the money. I think they could improve her by making her recognize voices easier and also having more options and questions."
1,Don't Bother!!!,"My daughter played with this doll for 10 minutes, put it down until the next day and she never worked again!! I saw the negative reviews and still decided to try it, never again! This doll does not even deserve 1 star. And by the way she doesn't look like the doll on the box, she's pretty creepy looking!!"
1,Very Unhappy,"The only thing my 6 year old daughter asked for this Christmas is Amazing Allysen. What a rip! Took a long time to get her out of the box, put all the batteries in, then turned on the doll and her mouth and eyes move, but there is no voice! Tried calling the 800 number and got put on hold, then told after five minutes of waiting for the ""busy agent"" that they are closed. Now I have a very disappointed child and a disgruntled mother who will now have to fight the crowds again to return this doll. Stick with dolls that don't talk....the ones we used to play with as kids."
4,Good tv western,I am an Audie fan and this was ok for its time on tv. He was a better actor but tv was not too good yet and did not bring out the best in the actors.
4,Whispering Smith,"Old TV series Western in the quiet Audie Murphy style. A little slow, but that was 1961."
4,Whispering Springs-Audie Murphy,"I love these shows. The black and white quality is not too bad considering how old these shows are. There is no cursing however a lot of action. I wish there qwere more of these available. Thanks, Paul"
4,whispering smith,"the picture quality was alright, a little distorted but not bad. my father was just happy to add something more to his collection. mainly he was happy to have another audie murphy item. i was a fan of the movie, so it was amazing to see a whole bunch of stars when they were young. this was a good find."
5,Entertaining,"Wow! I just enjoy the good over evil, right out-wits wrong. What a joyful experience this was. The Law was truly just."
5,A great TV series,This TV series Stars the most decorated American Soldier. Great honest to goodness western stories with a moral ending.
3,Whispering Smith,These are good old shows staring Audie Murphy. Some of my DVD's must have been bad. they have places where they stop for a few minutes.
3,Western,If you like Audie Murphy and IF you like westerns you will enjoy this. Aside from Audie Murphy the other actors are 2nd rate and hokie. But Audie does a good job.
3,"Not bad, but dont get too excited","I bought this, not knowing anything about this series, but being an Audie Murphy fan. He did a great job in this series but his supporting cast was weak. They are pretty good and enjoyable but overall, I was a bit disapointed. Apparently, he didn't like this series himself, but if the price is right, as it was when I bought it, I would get it if you like the typical western series of it's day and like Audie. He himself, did not disapoint....he did a very good job in it."
4,Whispering Smith,"Enjoyed this series allot.Being an AUDIE MURPHY fan from years ago,I thought the reproduction to DVD reasonably good,allowing for the age, and black and white .Occasional sound problems, but still very watchable.Recommended for enjoyment."
4,Whispering Smith TV series,"This is the second black/white series we have purchased. It, too, was a very well done reproduction. Though neither the picture nor the sound quality were as good as I would have liked, it certainly is a joy to not be concerned about our grandchildren viewing this as well.One of the things my wife and I appreciated most was the dialogue. It actually seemed to be better than some of the TV shows of today. Of course, the PC police weren't so obnoxious then.Highly recommend this series."
4,Whispering Smith,"I bought this on a whim for $9.99 at Half Price Books. Very Good film quaility, good audio. The DVD's come in 3 black slim line case, each with a 2 - 3 three line synopsis of each episode on the back. None of the disc's are marked 1,2,3, nor is the front or back cover sleeve on the case numbered.Number 1,2,3, appears on the thin edge of the case sleeve liner. Unfortunately the box the the three cases slides into is so tight fitting the cases cannot be pulled out of the box. You have to open the end flap and push them out.The episode titles that appear on the main menu page are very hard to read. Its a weird written font. I watched them on a 19"" TV, maybe a larger TV would be better?? The series only ran one season with 26 episodes. The set I bought has all 26(twenty Six) episodes plus the Audy Murphy Story. FOr some reason Amazon says 25 episodes.Its nice to see all the old actors and actresses that are long gone...."
4,Pretty good,Like Audie Murphy but I though the episodes here were boring and not well done. No wonder the series didn' last long.
5,Joes gift.,"Unfortunally this is not what my husband wanted. I did received it right away, but he was looking for the movie version with audie murphy not the tv series. But thank you for getting it to me so fast."
1,Wrong Product,"The title of the product says that this is a PCI card, but I was sent an AGP card, which is incompatible with my computer."
5,IS This Comparable To NEC MultiSync 3FGe,"Attention:The reason why I am asking your opinion on the above, is simply this:I have a NEC MultiSync 3FGe 15"" Color Monitor; I intend to purchase the DELL PRE610 Processor. Therefore, I am wondering if my monitor would be compatible with it?Thank you.Derryck GriffithManhattan. New York."
1,The Gold Standard has certainly depreciated,"This book, by far, goes on my list of one of the worst books I have ever had the displeasure of reading. Pseudo-clever theoretical jumps about texts that oversimplify and completely decontextualize what the texts say. For example, ""The Yellow Wallpaper,"" commonly thought to present a woman who is confined by her husband/doctor in the attic to lead to her eventual madness. According to Michaels, the short story is not about confinement and restriction, but about over-production of hysteria that the unnamed narrator is forced to engage in because of the ideology of her society. Interesting? maybe. Insightful about the Yellow Wallpaper? Not at all. If you are into post-structural theory masturbating over itself 244 pages, please buy this book."
3,Beadwork Creates Bracelets,I really like the book. Great illustrations and instructions.The only negative I can find about this book is trying to keep it open while using.
2,"nice projects, poor instructions",I tried to make 3 projects so far using the book and have had no luck. It seems that the projects are missing half of their directions. I'm not a novice and this just frustrated me. I found the same book at the library and now regret purchasing this when I could have been frustrated for free. I'll end up taking it to a local bead store and getting an instructor to decipher the projects.
2,NOT for anyone needing clear instructions-none of her book are!,Book is too small and will not stay open. Pictures choosen for book are nice. Instruction are NOT that helpful. I got excited and bought all her little narrow books after reading somewhere they were great for beginners. NOT SO! WHAT HAPPENED TO REAL PICTURES SHOWING HANDS ON INSTRUCTIONS? There are MUCH better books out there. This seems printed right out of a magazine like Bead and Button that has poor instructions also. Lines and dots do not make clear instructions unless you are a cat chasing a ball of yarn.I sold all my books on Ebay.
5,Great Video,"This tape has episodes 24 and 33 of Monty Python's Flying Circus. 33 is my favorite (of all the episodes.) In episode 24, in the sketch wher they show an episode real fast, they frogot a sketch and added animation. I liked the Salad Day's sketch. This is a good movie to buy. (I didn't buy it, but I have seen it.) So buy it now."
4,Not much light - wires not connected inside,"It is very dark - only 125 watts total, and with the dark shades, it's even darker. But - it's very pretty and looks great installed.Ours came with the wires from the lights not connected inside the fixture. So we had to take the whole thing apart and re-wire it. Very annoying, but not hard to do. It was worth the $50 I paid for it, but only because we could fix it ourselves (it was way too big to figure out how to ship it back to Amazon!)"
1,false Advertisement,"I ordered this product thinking I was getting a 240 Watt 5.25 system, but what I received was a 150 watt 5.25 system. When requested an explanation from the supplier I was told, the manufacture changed the specs on this product, so what you see is not what you are getting. I would contact the supplier before ordering this item. Needless to say I kept the item since I was left with no other option. Shipping and packaging of the item was great, but I would have been happier if the product I purchased was the product I ordered."
2,whats wrong with danzig?,"from the fits to samhain to this. its not getting better.danzig 1-4 are really remarkable albums, 5 was ok. now this, i can't put this in my cd player and sit through one song, they are all lame!danzig is now in the "" i want to sound like limp bizkit, orgy, korn and every other flava of da month band"" mode. the music just sucks. the cheesy rob zombie guitar riffs, the really cheesy cover art, the sudden billionith line up change, and his voice. he sounds like he has a sore throat and uses none of his amazing vocal talents on this album.amazing i found only one good song on this album, Thirteen. get 2 or 4, buy this for your Godsmack listening friends."
2,At least it isn't the worst thing he's done...,"...but it's the 2nd worst.Overall, a flat album. Only ""Cult w/o a name"" comes close to Danzig at their finest. Let's face it - the Danzig/Von/Christ/Biscuits lineup was incredible and cannot be recreated - especially by the sub-par musicians now posing as this band. Glenn's voice sounds weak and, although not as blatant as on BLACKACIDEVIL, he frequently masks it with distortion. Medicore songs are difficult to distinguish from one another.Just entirely uninspired. Come on, Glenn - we know you can do worlds better."
1,Satan's Mild!,"This is the worst Danzig album I have ever heard, and I have them all. First of all, what the hell happened to Glenn's voice? Those morons from Orgy (Amir Derakh and Jay Gordon) snuffed him out under all those electronic sound effects that they use to make their own albums horrible. Drum machines? Oh, come on! Glenn's voice is something to be heard, and it's not nearly as present as it should be. The biggest tragedy here is that the music on this cd sounds like everything that is flooding the airwaves these days. There's not too much innovation here like I have come to expect from Glenn. Basically, the album sounds too hardcore. It's boring. He should call up Chuck Biscuits and John Christ and see what they are up to. They might be able to bring him back to his original form. Amen.P.S. The Devil girls only add insult to injury. Enough with the porn stars. Kid Rock uses them. It's pathetic."
1,TERRIBLE!,"I am a Danzig fan from the very beginning of the band. This album is straight up trash! It's worse than ""Blackacidevil"" There is not one redeeming quality to this album, the music is horribly amiturish, as for the vocals; if Glenn can't sing anymore then he should hang it up because he is shaming himself putting stuff like this out!"
2,You got knocked da fuuuuuuuuuuuuggggg out!!!!!!!,"That is what I said to his punk ass as he was lying on the floor with a busted lip and jaw. Hey Glenn..Danny says hi, motherfugga!! lolThis album sucks....only good ones: Lilin, Belly of the Beast, and Five Finger crawl..."
2,Lost in the Metamorphosis,"Glenn Danzig - John Christ, Chuck Biscuits, Eerie Von = Glenn Danzig (NOT Danzig) I try to keep a open mind when it comes to music, but sometimes you got to put a foot down. The eerie, gothic, dark feeling that was a huge part of albums 1 - 4 isnt there. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just not the same without the other guys."
3,Bearable,"This album is a vast improvement on Blackacidevil, but the one thing it does do, it makes it easier to understand why Danzig dislikes the reunited Misfits. THEY ARE BETTER THAN HE IS. He seems to have nothing special to offer on this CD, and the only reason he will sell any CDs, is because of who he was (which is what I do)."
3,"Good, but not great.","DANZIG 6 is a good disc from Glenn after a LONG wait, but it is not in he same league as LUCIFIGE (a masterpiece!). It , as pointed out by others, continues in the metal/industrial sound of BLACKACIDDEVIL (VERY good disc which I'm in the minority of people who liked that one).Still mediocre Danzig is better than the backstreet junk that s selling millons of discs today. I think I can bet you willnever see choreographed line dancing in a Danzig video. (I hope!)"
5,OH MAN!!,"alright i own EVERY danzig era misfits release, every samhain release and danzig 1-4, 6,7, circle of snakes, black aria 1 and 2 and also thrall demonsweat live. my latest purchase, danzig 6 blew me away. i read reviews from everybody on here and most people were running down this album along with danzig 5 black acid. well this album hits hard and is a must for die hard fans like myself. only problem with this is glenn's vocals are dubbed over and most of the songs dont even sound like him but the beats are great. he should have stayed with american recordings as his sound was the best (as heard on danzig 1-4). this isnt his best work, but a very solid work to say the least."
4,Very solid recovery after #5,"Ive been a Glenn fan since The Misfits. I was really into Danzig thru Danzig 4 and kinda got away from his music when the RETCHID 5th CD, Blackacidevil came out (Glenns wonderful voice cannot be heard, only 4-5 songs worth listing to).Now its 2006 and Im going back to get the stuff I missed. This CD, Satan's Child, is very strong. Its still not on par with Danzig 1-3, but it is a step in the right direction.Glenn is the most powerful frontman in rock today. To anyone wanting to start a Danzig collection, Start at the beginning and work forward. Skip 5 if you are running low on cash. 6:66 Satan's Child is very good. The other CD's are solid as well."
5,Danzig Is The MAN!,"Satan's Child has left a mark in me with it's superb vocals, the brutal beating of the drums, and it's rage behind the bass and the guitars. Glenn has been so successful these past 20 years, and is still going. The Misfits today, will never ""Rise Above"" Glenns superior talent in which he doesn't flaunt as much the Misfts do, but don't get me wrong, The Misfits have a good album, but it looks like bloodshed compared to Satan's Child. Buy the album, and you will see what was mustered below in this world of Poppy-HipHop surroundings.""Let That Bad Boy Breathe..."""
5,Satan's Child F'in Rocks!,This cd is just incredible. That's all there is to it. It quite different from 1-5. It's a lot heavier and it cuts down on some of the industrial stuff from blackacidevil. Undoubtedly the best to date.
3,An introduction into Metal,"Five Finger Crawl is the standout track on this CD and is worth buying the CD just for that song. It is about the dark subject matter of death or murder as it starts out with a sound that could be gurgling blood. It is a fantastic CD, until you realize that it all sounds very similar, like one big song. Other great songs on the CD are Satan's Child, Belly of the Beast and the slow groove of Cult Eternal. I also have this to say about the album, rock and metal most of the time you focus on the guitars and drums, with this CD it gives you the ability to think of everything, chilling powerful vocals, thought provoking lyrics (about a dark subject), strong guitars, solid drums, and the occasional synth whining in songs during the instrumental bridges. This could be a big crossover metal to mainstream if it were not so dark. If you want to take a step into metal, this is your CD!"
2,Who Ya Tryin' To Mock?,"Almost could nudge this to 3 stars but not if you're a fan of the first four Danzig releases. The man's forsaken the drama of his music to infuse techno elements (read-""boring"") that previously popped up on ""blackacidevil"". This disc IS a step up from that one, but the sameness in texture just runs out of steam by the fourth tune. I could only find a few moments when I'd even say that the disc 'rocked.'"
2,Danzig is back and BORING,"Danzig has put out great albums, but this is not one of them. I liked Danzig 1,2,3,and 4 and even liked Blacidevil a little just because it was different. This was a yawn from start to finish, save for one song or two. He is a great artist usually, but get an earlier release or just rediscover one you already own than lay down the coin for this one!"
5,Life changing book! A must read for all women!,I had taken a couple of tantra workshops and this book provided even more information than i thought possible! This is a must read for every woman. I am getting copies for my close women friends and verbally telling other galfriends about it. It is easily read-able and do-able. This has changed my sex-life forever.
2,Disappointing stereotypes,"I am new to tantra, but not to meditation or conscious exploration of sexuality. The author makes a lot of blanket assumptions about how ""we"" women experience ""our"" sexuality (repressed, pressured, abused, man-pleasing, out of touch with our own pleasure or power, fearful of penetration, truly desiring only of sweet, tender caresses) and about how men's sexuality is (aggressive, insensitive, rough, fast, out of touch with his own emotions, truly desiring only to get it in and off as fast as possible). Perhaps this describes many women's sexual lives, but not mine. It took enormous self control to keep reading and give the ideas a fair trial. The second half was less patronizing. I tried out some of the ideas and had an excellent experience, but I did not find the author's take on tantra to be inspiring or insightful. I will be pursuing tantra, but looking for a more modern book, one which speaks better to the psycho-sexual landscape of women raised in the 80s-90s-00s."
3,Not the clearest phone,"There is some static with one of the 2 phones that I have. You cant edit a number unless you delete all the way back to where you need to change a number. You can edit a name with no problem. If you receive a call from caller ID that is long distance you cant put a 1 in front of the area code in order to call it back easily. I periodically get searching on both handsets and have to unplug the base from the wall to get it to work again. I got the phones at wal-mart for $17.97 because of a pricing error, if I had payed 50-60 for these phones it would not have been worth it."
1,Does a fast fade,"This thing worked ok right out of the box, but boy, it went south big time. I started getting complaints from people I was talking to that they couldn't hear me after a few months. I'd have to switch to a land line. Now, after about a year, I can barely hear the dial tone through the static. Totally unusable. New batteries don't help. Switching phone plugs didn't help. Or the phone line. Vtech will never be on my buy list again."
5,Best phone ever used,"Have been shopping for phones for a while, and this one is definitly the best I have ever used (amoung a few different brands). I can be on the intercom whithout blocking the incoming calls. The batteris are regular rechargeble AAA and last quite long."
1,Lasted just 8 months!,"These phones were great for the first 7 months! Then the static started. Phones unusable 99% of the time. For the last two days one phone says it is ""Searching"". For what, I don't know. I know I'm going to be searching also, for my receipt and warranty info that came with this phone so I can find where to ship it back to. If you want a cheap phone that works for a short time, this one's for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
2,"Good Phone, for One Year--LONG TERM REVIEWS MATTER!!","This phone was purchased by me for a Christmas gift last year (04).Two weeks before Christmas '05 it began getting severe static on the transmit and receive. At first I thought batteries needed recharged---no, fresh ones didn't help. The static would ease after being on the phone for a couple of minutes. I don't know for sure if it had found a clearer channel out of the ""95 channels"" the manual says the phone is capable of using, or, just a glitch in the hardware itself? Whatever, ""you get what you pay for"" in a phone made in China---should have known $49 and only one year warranty would be a clue to an early demise. Too bad, the phone was pretty nice for the first year---would have given it a 4 overall if it would have lasted 3yrs."
1,Didn't last very long...,When I bought this phone (against the reviews on Amazon) it was okay at first. I've had it for less than a year and am already having to buy another phone. It turns into this crackling static noice and the person on the other end can't hear at all. I also agree that after being on the charger for any length of time the phone will burn your cheek because it's so hot. I definitely would advise against making this your new phone.
1,Searching and searching and searching,"Like others,my phone simply displays a message indicating""Searching"". It won't ring, I can't place calls. The user manual says nothing about the Searching message, their website has not assistance.On the plus side, the phone was inexpensive. On the minus side, it's cheap."
1,Who designed this thing?,"I haven't had the best of luck with phones, but this is bad even for me. This isn't a phone so much as a cruel practical joke. Perhaps a twisted experiment to see if people will pay good money to be tortured in their own homes by a small electronic device. A few of my favorite features include:1. Poor sound quality2. Intermittently cuts out3. Randomly forgets numbers in memory and/or caller ID4. Beeps loudly and incessantly whenever the battery runs low (usually around 3am)5. Sounds the low battery alarm even while sitting in the charger!6. Is interfered with by WiFi, baby monitors, or anything else at 2.4GHz7. Occasionally refuses to dial phone numbers for no apparent reason8. Did I mention the poor sound quality?Buying this phone is a recipe for disaster. As for me, I'm going back to the tin can and string that worked so well when I was a kid."
2,Pretty good while it lasted,"I was pretty happy with this phone, especially considering how little I paid for it in April '04. One thing I particularly like is that the LCD displays a message when one of your other phones is in use. The illuminated keypad and backlit LCD are great. Though I really didn't use it, the handset speakerphone can be useful. The phone did not conflict with my Wireless G network. And--believe it or not--the handsets use standard AAA NiMH batteries; not expensive proprietary battery packs.But after a little more than a year of use, the phone has stopped working. I have owned a lot of cordless phones (VTech, Uniden, Panasonic, Sony, etc.), and the only two that have worked well AND lasted are both Unidens. So I'll be replacing my defunct VTech with the comparably priced Uniden DTC 646-2."
4,"Overall, good purchase","I agree with most of the previous reviewers so I'll try not to repeat what they have said.I am pleased that these phones use NiMH batteries (three in each phone) which are much superior to NiCad batteries. NiMH batteries hold more charge, don't have memory effect, and are easily replaceable.The recepting range of the phones is very far so it can be used outside.One major annoying of this phone is that you can hear yourself talking occassionally -- and turning the volume down doesn't help sometimes. Also, transferring a call to the other handset is a little complicated. Besides that these phones are great."
2,so-so product,"I decided to buy the v-tech phone after reading many positive reviews, but I was unimpressed with it and decided to return it. On the plus side, the hand-set speaker-phone is handy and has fairly good sound quality, and the dual hand-sets are a nice feature. However, I found the sound quality very poor - there was often a hissing noise as well as echoing. Also, the hand-sets would run out of batteries very quickly."
1,Bully tactics,I think it's sad we live in a world where it's OK to make a product totally at the expense of another person.I like Paris Hilton - and I have a lot of self esteem thank you.
4,Not perfect but nicely padded,"My 10-year-old Ragdoll absolutely loves staring out the window at the birds and squirrels. (What cat doesn't?) The windows in my master bedroom are about one foot from the floor, which means he has to stand up to see out the window. When I saw this window perch, I thought it was the right width and padding for my 15 lb. cat.When it arrived, I wasn't thrilled by the screw used to tighten the legs against the wall. It was painful to turn once it started to get tight, and it doesn't truly hold the legs so that they can't move. With a 15 lb. cat, that could be a problem!It took my cat about one week to get used to the idea of sitting on the perch to look out the window, and I had to move it to the right window so that he can look out the left. (I don't know why, maybe Ragdolls aren't all that smart. lol) In any case, he was looking relaxed and happy on it this morning. There's plenty of room for this big guy, and the perch isn't sagging under his weight."
5,Perfect,"I love this wallet. I go out to lunch alot with collegues and all I need are the basic credit cards, license, and cash. I can grab this and go, put it in my suit pants pocket and not have it so or even put it my jeans and maintain an bulkless, slimline look. Great wallet, durable, nice feel worth the investment."
5,Brutal honest movie,"What I love about this movie is the beautiful portrayal of the relationships between Tano and his friends and family. Each interaction is perfectly depicted in such a way that you can see clearly the love and betrayal between each of them. The crime is honestly portrayed so that you feel clearly the sense of wrong, yet are compelled to watch on. Moments of hope that Tano experiences are mercilessly snatched away from him, as the inevitability of his neighbourhood and circumstances play out"
2,Juevinal Delinquents with hearts (?) run wild one weekend,"Why 7 Virgins as a title? It took three viewing for me to figure it out. (you r right, I am not very smart) it is the ""holy cards"" of the Virgin Mary that one cast members holds. But this has nothing to do with the film. Go figure!Release from Juvenile jail for his brother's wedding he goes crazy but in the end supports his nervous brother.I rate this a C or C+. Meaning, you really do not need to see this film.Violence, brief nudity, no sex to speak of and disorganized."
4,Funny unknown movie,How can you not like a movie where two man dressed as monks get in a fist fight outside the Vatican? You just can't.
5,Funny,I love this movie! It is funny and clever. The film quality is not the best but the movie is so entertaining and it makes me laugh.
2,Krik Krak,"krik krak was a great book if u wanted to know about the history of Haitin women and what they went through during the time when Haiti and Dominican Republic were at war. Its very painful to read all these crule things that were dont to them but yet very satisfying to read how they tried to over come all their trials and tribulations.They kept strong or at least tried to anyway.When you read this book you will get to know the things that women had to go through, that you may have not known before.I think that everyone she take sometime out of their days to sit down and read this book they might learn a thing or two."
5,"Beautiful, enchanting set.","When you hold this set of three books, it feels as if you are holding something precious and rare, and in fact you are. The three books are beautifully illustrated; an introduction to each volume explains that which you are about to read and the verses and text were chosen with care. The books are described as being produced to "". . . delight the senses and enlighten the mind."" They easily fulfill that promise."
5,Beauty and Wisdom in a box,"The books are a feast for the eyes, the mind and the soul. Beautiful artwork enhances every page of the insightful and inspiring text. The combination provides moments of pure enlightenment."
2,Galbraith and Peters and Farinelli.. oh my!,"I am a fan of both Bernadette Peters and the uber Liberal economist now deceased, professor John Kenneth Galbraith. JKG was in his prime denouncing Reagan in the mid to early 80s. He had the supreme confident of a man not at all encumbered by the facts. That is the main entertainment value reading old publications.. seeing how far off their predictions were.The gal in the centerfold as the mag points out gives an entirely new meaning to the term ""robust"""
4,K1500 Ball Joints,"I ordered the Ball Joints for a 1992 K1500 Blazer, they where shipped quickly and packaged well. Installation was without any surprises. They do appear to be very good quality, only time/miles will tell if they are.I hope this review helps other buyers.Thank you,Dale"
3,Bought for Valentines Day Gift,"Bought this for my boyfriend (he's Polish) for valentines day. The quality is okay, since I only paid $5. The print isn't straight, and curves towards the end, which is only slightly noticeable."
3,OK...,This flag is ok for the price. You can get better but it will cost more. This is a simple printed flag.
5,Beautiful watch at a good price,"I am looking for a watch that could be casual and a dress one. This watch do the job! The chronograph function works very well, but the tachymeter requires more time of study to learn how to use it. Anyway, It looks nice in my arm."
1,So disappointing,"I have used Samsonite for years, but these are really garbage. After just 1 flight the seams were ripping apart. The warranty on these are difficult to have fulfilled, so now I have three of these, two of which with ripped seams, and a third that I'm frankly scared to use. Do yourself a favor and pay a bit more, these will do nothing but burn your money away."
2,Not as good as the previous version,"I bought this in order to replace a well-loved rolling dufflebag that has been discontinued. As far as I can tell this *should* be the replacement for the duffle that I previously had. However, when I started to pack it for the first time, I had so many issues...not as much open space; bag is heavy for its size; too difficult to pack for a long weekend. It just is not as nice a bag as the previous one. I'm really disappointed."
2,Not what you expect from Samsonite,"I travel extensively and am a fan of Samsonite luggage. In my opinion, this product shouldn't carry the Samsonite name. On the plus side, it was inexpensive, is made of a decent fabric, and has the perfect amount of space to suit my needs.That said, the construction is poor. After just one flight it is beginning to fall apart. It invariably tips upside-down when packed, and the handle is difficult to work. I would not recommend this product."
3,not great,"The ""blow up"" photos of the black bag is wrong. The black is just like the red.I bought this hoping to match a bag I bought locally. At first glance the bag looked identical to the one I already owned. I did not notice that the Amazon bag has two side pockets. This makes the top opening significantly smaller and therefore its much harder to get things in and out of the bag.Other than that,not a bad bag."
4,too bad it is not too resistant,"i ordered a new on efor my hubby, too bad it is not too resistant, but then we are talking about a hard traveller (like 2-3 weeks per month!!!). Unfortunately we have not found smth similar in terms of size and color to be good enough for business. Hopefullly Samsonite will make smth similar but more resistant (the side that comes in contact with the ground, so to say, gets damaged pretty soon.. though we bought the previous duffle in 2007 so now in 2010 it was about time that we get a new one!) ON a plus side, THE ONE WE BOUGHT ON amazon WAS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE ONE, BOTH ITS PRICE AND shipping, better than from Luggage .com or other places.. And fast shipping. So congrats Amazon on this."
2,poorly made,"At the bottom, where the wheels area meets the cloth, they cloth separated from the plastic, thus rendering it useless and irreparable. It was ok for a few trips though, so two stars."
3,Too Small for our needs,"This would be good for an overnight bag, but it is not the large wheeled duffle I thought it would be."
5,Max & Ruby DVDs,"My nearly-3year old granddaughter is a big fan of Max & Ruby, which makes me a fan, also. We enjoy both DVDs every week when she visits us for an overnight stay. The stories are learning tools that make learning fun. The characters are adorable.I highly recommend these products."
5,The Real McCoy,"If you apply William Atwoods principles, all that is left for you to do is ""write the check."" He lays everything out so simply that everyone at any age can understand the principles of investing for a real millionaire future. The best part of the book is the real life stories of people who are just ordinary, common wage earners, and how they put into place the way to financial freedom. The only way you can loose is if you don't really want to be a millionaire!"
1,Deceitful Food for the Beguiled Hungry,"Authors indicate that ""black"" in the biblical text refers to skin color, while ""white"" does not refer to skin color, but is only a metaphor. See (or better yet, don't see) the notes to Song of Solomon. This is only one of a parade of inconsistencies and errors. This ""bible"" is a hermeneutical disaster. The only redeeming quality is the King James text, but even that is riddled with apparent type-setting or typographical errors."
2,Faulty thinking on Jesus's skin color. Really faulty!,"The author of the preface deems that Jesus, Mary, and Joseph must have all been black skinned to go into Egypt and hide there. The faulty thinking is that all Egyptian people were darkskinned and thus black. Far from all egyptians were actually blackskinned. There were white Greeks living and (until around 31 BC) running Egypt, remember Cleopatra. White Italians running and rsesiding Egypt as it was now a Roman province and so on. Jesus and his family need only have been as white as Ralph Nader and they could very well have successfully hid in Egypt."
5,I Hear You Calling,"""I Hear You Calling"" was actually featured on the soundtrack of the very popular 2002 video game ""NHL 2002"". It's one of those great songs that you could just pop in your CD player and walk down the street listening to. Definately among my favorites."
5,Fantastic shounen-ai series with a good plot,"I just read the second volume in the Fake series and I'm just as thrilled by it as I was by the first volume. As I'm anxious about reading the third book in the series, this will only be a short review. ;)In the first story Ryo and Dee are on holiday in England, but a mysterious series of murders threatens their well-deserved vacation. In the second story we learn about Dee's youth as an orphan. And the last story is again a short story with Bikky and Carol.Again Dee tries to get cozy with Ryo and again succeedes only a little bit more. ;)"
1,PB8 Review,Unfortunately I had to give this 1 star for 3 weeks of use with no sign of feeling better. I will adjust review in a few weeks if warranted.
2,Wireless network,"I ended up removing this product from my computer. It was always sending and receiving data. For what reason, I never found out. It was causing my connection to the Internet to run very slowly. After I removed it, my computer was running much faster. It did help me initially set up a secure wireless network."
5,SURPRISE confert to coffee,"I WAS a TEA drinker! until I read this book. It was ordered BY MISTAKE in order to qualify for free shipping (thought it was a cup warmer!). I was so annoyed and was about to send it back but - READ it anyway and once started was so intriqued and hankering for real coffee I could smell the aroma right out of the book.If an author can do that to an avowed tea drinker, and make you run out and buy the best coffee beans and grind them and pour boiling water over the grounds in a strainer with coffee filter until buying a coffee machine when convinced... and DRINK the stuff that does NOT taste like tea but something AMAZING - wow! and bow wow!Buy this book - whatever you drink now. Read not only all the directions from buying to brewing to drinking, then the history culture and everything connected to Coffee - you're getting the full scope from a first class story teller. (I think I'll go back and read it again, and brew some coffee!)"
4,Good Coffee Origin Info,"There is much good information in this book on many topics about coffee roasting, grinding and brewing. I was particularly interested in the description of the characteristics of coffees from various parts of the world."
4,Great background info on coffee,"I've read a number of coffeebooks, but the history section in this one is quite thorough. It also gives information about the various types of coffee around the world and how they've been cultivated differently in different regions."
4,Grounds for a good Read,"I found the book Coffe: A guide to Buying, Brewing, and Enjoying, to be a great read. Lots of history about coffee and how the beans are processed and roasted. A small book with alot of info for the money. This book cost more to ship than to purchase. The book goes into great detail about where the various beans come from, and if you want to learn how to taste and become a veteran coffee gourmet this book has a section on tasting and judging coffee. How to slurp! It also lists the various areas around the world where coffee is grown and the types. I really appreciate going to the store and now understanding where my coffee came from and what to expect in flavor with the beans that I am buying. This book is grounds for enjoying it!"
4,"a guide to brewing and enjoying, fifth edition",This is a great book covers everything you need to know about roasting and enjoying coffee. Easy to read and full of interesting information.
3,Good Information and strong opinion,"While informative, this book is a somewhat opinionated and even snobbish introduction to coffee as a gourmet item."
1,Coffee is Brown,Coffee is a brown beautiful color.Ink is black set to a white back ground in books for a very good reason.If I had known the printing in this book was a light brown color that is hard to read I would not have wasted my time or money.This may be a very good book but I will never know.Keep the color in the coffee and your hands off the ink.I have the fifth edition.
1,Ugh,Obvious lip syncing. She sweated so much it was disgusting. Watched it once and threw it out. I wouldn't even give it away to someone.
5,Amazing! Miss Jackson Puts on the BEST concerts,"Janet is Amazing here! this is a Must Have for any Concert lover! I thought 'The Vevlvet Rope' Tour DVD was unbeatable But i dunno, She slays just as much here, And the environment seems so much more fun and happy and Janet herself Loves and connects to the Crowd."
1,Absolute collection of random topics! One word - Horrible,"This book has a random collection of topics. I cannot believe a publisher actually published it. It discusses DTDs and XSLTs in great detail while completely ignoring XML Schemas and SOAP basics. I absolutely decided to return the book when I found a section discussing viruses - specifically the ILOVEYOU virus. If Amazon provided a way to give this a negative rating, I would gladly do so."
1,This book is not real world,This book does not have any real-world examples. The specifications mentioned in this book are also dated. The content in this book is a little dated. For a current book on Web Services check out Java Web Services Architecture published by Morgan Kaufman.
2,Hard to read and useless as a reference,"I had a hard time reading this book. It is good in the sense that I got some of the code working pretty quickly, but once I started to ask WHY things worked, I was lost with the book.I had no idea about Web Services before reading this book. The book presents detailed information - which almost works - for 5 different implementations of SOAP-based Web-Services Plattforms. After which the example is depending on one special - non open source - plattform. Porting the code to AXIS was not straigth forward because I could not find out what the different statements in the example did.I hope the next book on Web Services provides more useful information."
4,"Finally, a book with decent Java WSDP coverage","This is the first book I've seen that gives more than trivial examples of JAX-RPC and JAXM from the Java Web Services Developer Pack. It also gives excellent coverage of configuring the Java WSDP reference implementation for JAXM messaging providers, which is poorly documented by Sun. I wish this book had been published 8 weeks earlier; it would have saved me a lot of angst.As with most other Java Web services books, its main drawback is that it is overly ambitious: it covers XML, DOM, XSL, SOAP, UDDI, WSDL, as well as Java WSDP, all in 700 pages. I would have preferred more in-depth coverage of Java WSDP. But it's still the best Java web services book I've seen."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book to be outdated; the Web Services Developement Pack mentioned (ver 1.0), isn't available anymore. What's worse is that many of the tools used haven't been carried into the latest version. For example, the xrpcc tool has been replaced by wscompile and the deploytool doesn't fully support webservices like the old one did (at least according to the book). If you find a better Java Web Services book let me know, as I am still searching for something useful."
2,"on HG ""j2ee_consultant""'s comment below.","HG""j2ee_consultant"":I appreciate your feedback on the book, but did not understand why you pulled the reference to ""Indian Companies"". If you think Indian Companies lack attention to detail and quality, surely you aren't acquainted with the philosophies that drive the day-to-day operations of Indian companies of the likes of TCS, Infosys, etc. India has the largest number of IT/Software companies outside US with CMM Level 5 Quality Rating, a certification not achievable without great attention to details and quality.So please get your facts and references straight, before you make such unwarranted comments about Indian companies, or any company for that matter.And by the way, Deitel & Associates are a strictly American company, and have nothing to do with Indian companies."
4,Pretty Cool Phone,"I like this phone. The reception is just as good as the regular LCD version. The pictures on the phone are not as clear they appear on the box, but they are still good. The downloadable ringtones only lasts for about 10 seconds or so and then that ten seconds of clip is repeated until phone is answered or the caller hangs up. It is easy to use and the instruction manual is helpful. All in all, I like it and I plan on keeping it."
1,3 strikes and you are out,"Our third handset is on it's way out. 3 dead in one year. The keypads go bad (buttons become hard to push, you have to use a pen) and the charging cradle also goes bad; you have to jiggle it just right to get it to charge. All in all the worst phones I have ever purchased."
3,Art 'n' Zoot,"Zoot is wonderful as always, but Art Pepper shows the ravages of his drug addition. Not good. All of the rhythm players are great."
5,In her worst fear a girl named Caty gets captured by indians,"The captive diary of Cathrine Carey Logan is very sad but a great book.In her wrost fear her and her brother,Thomas ,get captured by a group of Lenape indains.For days they were unable to eat or even speak a word.They eventually adapt to their new environment.Cathy falls in love with and earlier captive,Snow Hunter.When things were finally going good for them a group of English soilders come and take them back home where they feel like strangers even to their own family and are forced to adapt to this strange world once again."
5,GREAT,I thought this book was very good. Its about a girl named Cathrine who is captured by Indains at first she hates it but in the end she thinks Indain life is exciting.
5,Edge of your seat book,"This book will keep you on the edge of your seat. The main character,Caty, and her brother, Thomas get captive by Indians. They really hated the Indian life, but then they grew to love it. Just as they grew to love there Indian life some Indians got killed by the white men. We won't tell you any more just that if you read this book you will really like it. So start reading and good luck."
5,standing in the light,I read standing in the light with my class.I thought it was a vary good book.My favorite part is when Kate gave her book to her dad because she did not want to explaine her feelings to her elders.
5,Terriffic!!!!!!!!!!,"I agree with everyone here; this book is TERRIFFIC!!!!!!! The best one I've ever read. The person I borrowed it from says it's her favorite book in the Dear America Series. I just LOVE reading about historical fiction, and recently I've become interested in the slave trade back in the 1600-1800s. Now my mom's making me read Booker T. Washington, a free slave, for school. It should be good. I highly recomend this book, anyway, to any girl who loves thrill and adventure."
4,"Good for some, caution for sensitive readers!","I was intending to read this book, then offer it to my soon to be 9 year old niece (I have no daughters, alas!) She is a sensitive child and after reading this, I realized she'd be too upset by the early on conversation the heroine reports of the murders , scalpings and kidnappings . Otherwise, it was a pleasant and easy read, with insight and happy endings all around. As an adult, I would have liked a lot more detail (the books I read or was read as a child of 8 - Freckles, for example - had much more detail, which I drank in). But a sweet little gift. Instead of scaring my niece, I will donate it to my Meeting's library - we have some older girls who will enjoy the adventures of this girl. A nice gift it is a hardcover book with a pretty blue bookmark-ribbon, and a nice sketch of a young girl on the cover."
5,For One Of My Favorite Books,Standing In The Light was one of the best books I've ever read in my entire life. Thinking over the story makes me want to weep. It's about a young Quaker girl named Catherine Logan. She is captured by the Lenape Indians along with her little brother Thomas. She ends up falling in love with the head Indian warrior. Snow Hunter. Who was once a Quaker like her. But captured by Indians at a very young age and brought up by them. But they can't marry because in the eyes of Catherine's people- he is a savage. This book toutched my heart and I loved it. Read this book you will not regret it.
4,Standing in the Light,"This book is about Catherine Logan, or Caty, a teenage Quacker girl, in a time where the whites are against the Indians. There are several Indian raids in the village because of the broken promises made by the white settlers. Then while walking to school, she and her brother are captured by the Lenape tribe. Although Caty fears for their lives, they are instead given to the two members of the tribe whose children were killed by the measles. Caty, who once resented and feared Indians, learns to understand their culture and beliefs through her friendship with Snow Hunter, who was captured by the Lenape nine years before. She begins to fall in love with him. Soon enough, she in taken back to her white village and must adapt again to her Quaker lifestyle. She no longer feels connected to her family or friends and wishes she could return to being an Indian. Caty not only learns that Indians are not the enemy, but that they are not that different from she herself."
1,NOT THE BEST...,"This book is not a good one! I liked the VERY begining and once Catherine got captured I HATED IT. I mean, I knew she was going to be captured but her thoughts and feelings disturbed me. they were scary and SO DEEP. I hated the very end too. THIS BOOK IS JUST SO SAD! I love Dear America and I am used to sad books, but this book was just TOTALLY DEPRESSING. I felt crumpled up after I read this. I only really liked the part about Snow Hunter and Catherine loving each other... the only NICE thing. Try this book anyway but you should get it from the library instead. Don't look for a great, hopeful and happy sad book and pick this up!"
5,This is the best book I have ever read!,"""Standing in the Light"" is a great book! It realy touched my heart. I have read almost ALL of the DEAR AMERICA serise. If you haven't already read more than one, you realy should try them!"
5,A story you'll never put down,Standing in the Light is a story that warms your heart. This is a story about a girl stretched between two very different worlds. This is a wonderful book that deserves more then just 5 stars.
4,beautiful but not that big,"The mirror is beautiful. I have a tiny 1 bedroom condo so I thought the size would be perfect for my home. I believe this part is my fault because they give you the dimensions. However, if you want to make a huge statement in your home you may want one that looks like this gorgeous mirror but a bit larger. I will say they shipped it so well I don't think it ever would have arrived damaged."
5,Self-Growth,"The Power of Forgiveness demonstrates that using forgiveness and putting other's needs above your own can provide self-growth. John gives no illusion that forgiving someone is an easy task, but lets the reader know that it can be done. He shows that with God's help, we can be subjected to horrible things and yet live through them with dignity and a greater sense of wisdom and maturity. This book has a unique approach in the fact that by forgiving his wife, John gave his children a chance for a more confident future without being burdened by having to choose one parent over the other. This book speaks of using one's strengths and inward capabilities to overcome obstacles in life."
5,Forgive,"This is one book I could not put down. For many of us whodo not know how to forgive, cease to forgive, will not or havenot forgiven or has ask or never ask for forgiveness, forgave, and was forgiven- please read. With impact on the heart, mind, and soul- it introduces knowledge of self and self awareness from a individual to a ""wholistic"" perspective."
3,Eats batteries and a pain to configure,"I owned this remote for a couple of years. I bought it used and it did the trick. The problem really came up when I bought newer equipment (Sony receiver) and it would not work with it. Another issue was the batteries died and I had to reconfigure again. It's sweet looking, but gives off a high-pitch sound when lit up."
3,Bright at night dim in day,"This remote works great easy to program and set up to devices but if you watch alot of tv during the day it is hard to see and at night it is bright and it takes some getting used to haveing no buttons only a touch screen but other than that it works great on my hd plazma, my theater,combo dvd vhs,and dish reciever,and has a power button all will turn on and off if you program it to,all in all works great but the lighted pad I dont like and if you program it to turn on as soon as you pick it up it will come on during any vibration,if you set it to turn on with touching the pad only which saves on battery life you will surely touch a place on the pad that will cause the remote to change something if you are not careful so I am really not happy with the touch screen."
2,Sucks,Does not have enough preprogrammed components. I was only able to get rid of 2 of my 5 remote.
4,"nice control, good support","I recently purchased the URC-6960 via Amazon. Shippingwas quick, and the device generally works as described.I found that the ""setup"" key is difficult to reliably press, but overall it was was easy to setup the URC to control my TV and VHS deck.[...]I wish I could adjust the sensitivity level for the motion sensing ""turn on"" feature. Since I couldn't, I turned the motion sensing off to prolong the battery life.I feel that if one doesn't want the multiple-hundred dollar super remote controls (e.g.,Logitech Harmony 890 Advanced Universal Remote Control),then this is a good one to consider and at a nice price."
3,No much footage of the climb or everest...,"Maybe i picked up the wrong tape, but this one hardly contains any footage of the climb or the beauty of everest...most of the time i was staring into the climber's face as they were taking some sort of high altitude test... boring..."
5,Your head is in the jet stream,This documentary is really wonderful. But not wonderful for the glory of the conquest but showing just how deadly and treacherous this climb really is. Whether you are a wealthy wannabe or an experienced mountain climber it is beyond my conprehension why any sane person would want to endanger his or her life like that. Where's the glory in being drug up to the top like a sack of potatoes? It's almost sinful to play with your life in this way when there is no earthly reason to be there.The camera work is breathtaking. But it was painful to watch those climbers virtually dying in front of our eyes. This NOVA is a real eye opener for respecting the one life you have been given.
3,Good but not really quite what I expected,"I have 7 Everest DVD's and this one was not really as I expected. It was more clinical and of medical type interest and did not have to be Mount Everest to show the effects of low oxygen. They could have used any place above or around 8,000 meters. Frustrating in some senses because I felt a lack of Everest footage and views about the Death Zone etc., as well as being a fairly short film, sort of left me feeling wanting and slighty cheated. However, it goes fairly well with the collection since some of the other DVD's fil in the gaps."
4,An eccellent documentary on Everest.,"Narrated by Jodie Foster,this is an eccellent documentary on the climbing of Mount Everest and the dangers involved.There are some spectacular shots as they climb the mountain.It details the health problems that the altitude of Everest can cause and what happens when one member of the climbing expedition is taken ill and the efforts to get him down."
3,Run of the mill documentary,"This is a mountain climbing documentary intending to masquerade to some extent as a scientific endeavour. The mountain pictures are nice and even impressive, but the scientific subtext is between not very interesting and sometimes even laughable. The editing is fairly traditional, with lots of talking heads alternating with action and scenery. This is not bad, but there's better stuff elsewhere (touching the void for instance, which isn't a documentary but has wonderful mountain pictures and is much more thrilling at the end of the day)"
3,Pretty good,"Overall this tape is helpful with regard to teaching your baby to sign. The basics are covered in here along with the justification for teaching your baby to sign things like, drink, poop, hungry, thirsty... and so on. Maybe if this was a DVD it would have been more useful, it just seemed that they rushed it a bit and left out many other aspects of signing. All in all its ok, but I would recommend looking somewhere else for more in-depth training for your baby.Thank you for reading my review."
5,Signing,I think using signs when a child is too young to talk is the only way to go. This book was great.
2,Baby Signs,I agree this movie was not what I expecting it to be. I thought it would be more of the basics of sign Language. My baby does like watching it because of all the other babies. But it was not what I was look for in a baby sign videos. She shows no interest in learning these sign right now. And I would like to teach her the basics of sign language first before add these words from this video.
1,Baby Signs Review,"The BABYS SIGNS book contains great signing info, but I hesitate to purchase the video because the book DOES NOT advocate teaching babies AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE (ASL). It advocates ""making up"" signs . . . inventing your own language . . . limiting a child's ability to ""communicate"" with anyone outside of the immediate family. It's easy to simplify ASL signs that a child may have difficulty with. Why would anyone suggest ""making up signs"" when teaching ASL will provide your child a language they can use as babies . . . a basic language they can continue to learn in elementary, high school and beyond. American Sign Language is even being offered in high school and universites to fulfill the ""foreign language"" requirement. I hope parents will consider this before teaching their baby a non-universal language. If the video suggests ""making up"" signs like the book does, I'm simply not interested."
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this video. Besides the fact that it does not use American Sign Language (ASL) signs (which I believe is more beneficial for my child to learn in the long run as it will allow her to understand and ""speak"" a second language) the production of the video is extremely poor. It looks like the producers just got their kids together and told them what signs to do in front of the camera. There is nothing in this video that keeps my child's attention long enough for her to learn anything. For anyone serious about teaching their child signs I suggest See N Sign or the Sign With Your Baby kit. The kit is fabulous and worth the money if you are interested in your child learning something that will not only help him or her now to learn signs, but to help your child learn signs that can be useful in the future."
1,not universal,"Wasted time and money.this cable does not fit most push gas lawnmowers as advertised. The cable was not strong enough for my lawn mower.I suggest that you take the serial number off the cable to be replaced and order the replacement cable by this method.""One size fits most"" did not fit mine."
4,ecxelent,it woks great and save my client work because the tower is main workstation...i hope it doesnt fuse itself again
3,Tokio goes Argento,"It will only make sense if you're a gorehound... (like me). Stealing ""to much"" from Argento stylistic surrealism, Japanesse director Toshiharu Ikeda fails to deliver an asian Suspiria in every level.The films starts out very promising and begins to fade out into a senseless vortex of un-control subplots that leads to nowhere...the ending really makes no sense!...but this does not make the movie less entertaining...is just that it doen't make any sense. Now, what you do get is some very gruesome gore scenes of disturbing carnage, a very Argento atmosphere and fotography like, and even a very, very, very Goblin like score...sometimes it sounds more Goblin than Goblin!...Even though itsn't a great film, is not bad at all ...I was deeply entertain...but the ending is just completely unfaithfull with the rest of the film."
2,Well shot and directed derivative misogynistic trash,"I'd seen this because I've been getting into the new Asian horror film movement of late and I heard this was one of the best. More fool me. It WAS well directed, comparable to Dario Argento in particular in style and storyline. Nothing wrong with homages, but Argento, for all his own misogyny, is more even handed with the violence in his movies, showing men having graphic and terrible deaths. EDT seems to focus more on violence against its women, with only one on-screen male death that is extremely quick. I got caught up on EDT's surreal horror, but afterwords, when thinking about it, realized it didn't answer an essential question posed in the film: why does the killer kill, and why does the killer enjoy it? Because of this, the film becomes an empty misogynistic exercise. But it sure do look pretty."
3,Getting Better,"This movie is better than VERSUS or BATTLE ROYALE. It is a bit bizzare but it has a certain quality. And the BEST eye gouge seen since ZOMBIE. I liked this movie but you may not, Again, THIS IS ONE MANS OPINION> YOU BE THE JUDGE."
2,Don't even think about buying this.,"When my boyfriend said this game sucked, I thought how bad can it possibly be? Let's just say I can't describe how bad it is. The 10 minutes or so I tried to play seemed like 10 years. The characters sway, twitch, vibrate and move on the screen as if everyone in the game has Parkinsons or Tourettes syndrom. It was so bad I began to experence motion sickness from watching the screen. I thought when my boyfriend said the voice acting was gay he meant it was silly but no, most of the male characters sounded like they were fresh from the off off broadway revival of La Cage Aux Folles. The scenery and backgrounds were actually very nice to look at and well done. If I could have avoided any character interaction and run around the environment I would have played more than 10 minutes. I can't even bring myself to put this game up for sale to get rid of it because I don't want to foist it off on to some poor unsuspecting soul."
5,A book I actually liked in high school,"I loved this book. I resent being told I have to read anything. But I still found pleasure out of it. In this book Hester commits adultery and is forced to wear an ""A"" declaring her sin. You will see early on the hypocrisy of the town. Why not make someone where an ""L"" for liar or an ""T"" for theif? Hester is a complicated character. She is not trashy like I first expected. Not at all. This book has a lot of symbolism that I found beautiful. There are plenty of twists in this book. Don't watch the Demi Moore movie of The SL. It is completley different from the book. I recommend this book to everyone."
2,"Review of George Jones, Live in Concert","This is really a poor video. George sings well, but looks uncomfortable, as though he would rather not be there. The camera man taking the footage must have been sleeping. Really poor camera shots of the band. None of the band look as though they are having a good time."
5,wonderful CD,"Souvenirs de Jean Baptiste Singele ist eine CD, die man jedem Klassikliebhaber nur weiterempfehlen kann. Die Werke von Singelee sind sehr gut ausgewählt und eingespielt worden. Es ist ein Genuss! Eine Plicht für jeden klassischen Saxophonisten!!!"
1,"Cheap Junk, you can get way more quality and performance for the same price","These speakers are terrible. When they came, one of the four speakers was broken. On the other three, the midrange and tweeter plastic protective pieces were broken off. While this didn't affect performance, it was a sign of a poor product. As for performance, the bass is muddled and weak you can't tell when the note begins or ends. There is no treble. Midrange is soupy and muffled. I bought a pair of similar PYLE speakers and they are amazing. You can get 100X better performance and quality for the same price. Don't buy Legacy speakers."
3,Decent amp for the price,"this certainly is a decent amp for the price.i am using it with an older OEM radio and am using the Hi-level inputs rather than the rca's (Low level) that most people would use (if i had a newer headunit, i'd use the rca's too), so without using the shielded rca cables, i do get quite a bit of engine noise (whine dependant on engine revs even though i did route the power wires on the opposite side of the car from the speaker wires)...the resolve? crank it up louder...lol!another thing, it is also quite large, altho i did check its dimensions before i bought it, it still needs a good bit of space to mount it.and even though i have good speakers that can definitely handle the power this amp delivers, i had to play around with the gain controls to get it so that it wouldnt clip (distort) the bass at high volume.there are certainly much better amps out there, but i wasnt going to spend a small fortune on one and just wanted more volume from my factory radio...it does the job."
5,Amp'd Up,I didn't think it would be so small yet it is still powerful. I have it hooked up to my horn tweeters to give them that extra edge and they are way past the edge. Terrific product
4,Tastykakes Butterscotch Krimpets,"Great, I buy them for the kids in my class when we read a book called Maniac Magee. We can't find them in our area. The boy in the book is obsessed with Butterscotch Krimpets and the kids wanted to know why. So I ordered them and now whenever the author mentions Butterscotch Krimpets they all moan and ask if I can't order somemore. Unfortunately, they were too expensive to order again. The shipping was $5 dollars more than 4 boxes of the Krimpets. But they sure were good!"
3,Good collection of middling Boop,"This collection features 10 cartoons from the period 1935 to 1939. As such, these are not ""classic"" Betty Boops by any means -- the classic 'toons ended in 1934. But these cartoons are still enjoyable (at least none of them feature Betty's insufferable dog Pudgy) & the Good Times transfers are very good."
4,"It works, it fits.","Fit perfectly, vac works so much better. The outer filter stays on unlike the old one which never really did. It is a pricey replacement for an old vac that the engineers didn't think too hard about while engineering it."
2,pretty boring,I heard the author talk on tv...he doesn't translate well in the written form....sorry BORED to DEATH
3,it was ok,I learned a few things that I didn't know.It contained released government documents concerning ufo's which indicates that at least some of the ufo's are a creation of the military.
1,"Avoid, Avoid, Avoid!","If you enjoy cartoons ... avoid this product!If you enjoy sci-fi ... avoid this product!If you enjoy sci-fi cartoons ... avoid this product!While I understand a good review should detail parts of the product, I nearly had to stab myself in the eye to get to the end of the cartoons in order to end my misery. As such I refuse to expend the effort to go into great detail for such a shameless titling as ""The Greatest Sci-Fi Cartoons of All Time"" ... argh."
2,"Worth reading, but difficult","Schleiermacher sets the tone and pace for later Liberal Theology. This work is worth reading for gaining a proper understanding of even where evangelical theology rests today. The text is highly dense and confusing. Quite possibly, only Hegel is more confusing to read. However, Schleiermacher's view of religion, human nature, scripture, sin, redemption, etc. form the basis for much of modern and post-modern theology.While Clements argues that Schleiermacher isn't a pantheist, his own words actually argue a different case."
1,These bulbs burn out within two years of occasional use,"Do not buy these bulbs expecting superior life to traditional incandescent bulbs. We bought 12 of them in January 2008 and cycled them into our ceiling fixtures and floor lamps as the old incandescents burned out. Well, these burn out even faster than the old bulbs: only one remains uninstalled at this point and six of them, half the number we purchased, have already failed: a faster, not slower, rate of failure than incandescent bulbs. The five-year guarantee, as noted by another reviewer, is worthless since it involves mailing cost to Canada.The ""green"" advantages of buying bulbs that use less energy than incandescent bulbs is compromised when the flourescent bulbs are of poor quality. These bulbs contain mercury, and they are more expensive to manufacture (use more resources to make) than incandescents. It burns me up that we are dumping mercury and extra resources back into the waste stream after only one to two years."
5,Perfect for vanity lights,"I got these to go in the vanity lights over our mirror in the master bath, hoping they would be cooler on hot summer mornings than the regular bulbs, and they're great! Their light is more neutral, which helps in make-up choices, and they don't radiate heat like having six 60-watt bulbs do, so I can blow dry without the room getting too warm. The energy savings is just icing on the cake!"
2,Compact Flourecent Lights not the greatest,"Compact Flourecent Light bulbs may be good at saving energy, but they still have several issues consumers should be aware of.1) They cause headaches for a small percentage of people2) They cause eye strain if they are the sole source of light in the room. (personal experience)3) After several months of use they fail to light immediately when turned on and sometimes fail to light the entire spiral completely. (personal experience)"
1,Compact Fluorescent Bulbs contain mercury,"Compact Fluorescent Bulbs contain mercury. I am concerned about mercury contamination due to glass breakage and also eventual disposal problems. What about groundwater contamination? What is going to happen when these bulbs are discarded in vast quantities and it is discovered that they are not truly ""green"" but are a biohazard? Is it going to be worth the small amount of pocket change that you save annually?"
3,Watch your incentives....,"In Arizona, local retailers sell these bulbs for under a buck.... check for local incentives from your energy company!"
3,Overrated brightness level,The light output seems more equivalent to a 40 watt incandescent bulb than the advertised 60 watt bulb light output.
4,Excellent choice for energy savings,This is a no brainer replacement for a utility incandescent bulb.
2,OVER Priced,This item is over-priced. One can get this product at big box stores such as CostCo for about half this price. Less on bargain days. Shop around. Don't settle for high prices.
1,Not good...,"I currently have these bulbs, but yet I received an email from a family member letting me know that these bulbs contain mercury, very dangerous. If dropped you have to go through specific directions to clean it up as well as disposal if they do go out.I won't be buying anymore, even though they do last a long time. :( I'm too clumsy to worry about the mercury."
1,florescent light bult,"Sure they do save on electricity and last longer however people are not seeming to mention that they contain toxic mercury, which can be ingested or inhaled when they break. Also nobody ever talks about how florescent lights are not natural lighting and can cause seasonal depression or SAD. I will stick with my full spectrum natural lighting or open the shades , its alot less toxic to my health."
2,Disappointing color temp,"I gave these a try as I continue my search for a CFL bulb with as pleasing a color temperature as typical 60W soft-white incandescents. Maybe I'm just more sensitive to it than most, but to my eyes the light generated by these has a harsh, slightly greenish tint to it. They also suffer from about a one second delay between when you flip the switch to when they actually turn on. Tried multiple bulbs in the pack and they were all the same. For now I'll stick with the NVision bulbs from HD which at least turn on instantly."
2,Worthless Guarantee,"[ASIN:B000GBBUDE Globe 4860201 13-Watt Ultra-Mini Compact Fluorescent Spiral Bulb (60-Watt Incandescent Equivalent), Soft White, 4-Pack]]I installed the four bulbs soon after purchasing them in May. The first burned out in November. Checking the ""five year guarantee"", I found that the replacement requires sending the burned-out bulb to Montreal, Quebec, making the replacement as costly as buying a replacement. Anyone buying this product should disregard the guarantee completely."
4,Bringing the outdoor in,"A beautifully written and illustrated book, depicts not only landscapes, but also explains the historical background to the ideas presented in the book. Fascinating!"
1,Awful.,"Killed my sense of taste, like the tip of my tongue was burned. And stained my teeth too. I can't believe this stuff is still on the market !! Back to Listerine."
1,Buyer Beware,"YOU DO NOT WANT TO USE THIS RINSE! It will stain your teeth to kingdom come and take some doing in the dentist's chair to get rid of all the brown spots! Might be helpful for those who have major problems with decay, but otherwise there are better products out there and you should spare yourself the headaches and hassle."
4,Fascinating and also disappointing,"It is a major disappointment that 'The Yellow River' Piano Concerto was not recorded with the same diligence and quality as the Dragon Songs that form the main part of the DVD. Better than nothing but, hopefully, Lang Lang will record it again with one of the world's top orchestras and without the one hundred female pianists accompanying him."
1,Buy from an authorized reseller,"The watch is nice but stopped working after 21 days. No damage, nothing, just stopped at 8:05 PM last night. No manufacturer's warranty; rather an Amazon warranty in its place. In the process of returning.Is it me or should a $1300 watch work for more than three weeks?"
1,Tag heuer men's wv211b.bao787 carrera automatic watch,Being that this is my 4th tag watch it only takes the last one to reframe me from purchasing another. I can't belive the problems with this watch. 1st off I was wearing it every day and within the 1st year I sent it back for poor time keeping. Then went to adjust the date and it broke off. WOW!!! Plus the face is also easy to scratch. Would not recomend this watch. STAY AWAY FROM TAG.
2,Pretty but not for homework.....,"Though this lap desk is very pretty in design and certainly would make a girl smile at its sight, if it is anything like the awesome blossom desk (same desk, different design), it will not be very functional for homework or other writings of importance. The design on some of these lap desks are covered in glitter, which gives a texture that really gets in the way of smooth writing. It may be a good idea to attempt to rub some of the glitter off should your desk have this issue (this design may not have glitter, but it is likely as the awesome blossom design does). The cushion is made of poor quality fabric. Ever rub your fingers over a fabric and it kind of had a sticky feel to it? Well this is that. Also the cushion is glued in place and is already pulling loose in some areas. For the price, I would recommend another desk."
4,Correcting an error...,"You may recall that when Season 2, Vol. 1 of Gunsmoke was released, it accidentally substituted an episode entitled ""How to Cure a Friend"" (airdate November 10, 1956) with one from this season entitled ""How to Kill a Friend"" (airdate November 22, 1958).Well, as a solution, the season 2 episode in question is being included as a bonus feature on this set. It's not the best solution they could have used, but at least they have now given us the missing episode. ""Sponsor spots"" are also listed as a bonus feature."
5,More Gunsmoke!!!,"I'm so happy that another Gunsmoke set has come out! Gunsmoke is one of my all-time favorite TV shows, and I'm greatly enjoying being able to watch the early episodes, many of which I haven't seen before since the first six seasons don't run in syndication. I was a little worried that season four would never come, since it's been so long between release dates, but this is one time I was glad to be wrong.Please keep it up, Paramount. It will take a while to release the entirety of a show that ran for twenty years, but I think I speak for all die-hards when I say that we'll stick with it as long as you do!"
5,Gunsmoke- a great tradition,I was very happy to find this product. It was given as a gift. There will be many happy memories as we watch this beloved series.
4,"Gunsmoke, Season 4, Vol 1","Excellent to continue the series. Like most fans, however, I wish for a complete an entire season in one volume."
4,Very sad del here!,Gunsmoke is one great show. ButI laugh at the way they are putting it out. The way they are going it will be 20 + years to get it all.Really. It was on 20 years. And the way there are doing this. Season one part on and all this bit... No thanks....
4,great for the price!,These are awesome speakers for the $14 price! Listing says 30oz magnet... whole speaker only weighs 26oz... hmmmm
3,sound,"i put 4 of these lagcy 5 1/4 inch speakers in a box under my seat facing forward .hooked up with a boss threway crossover and same amp that runs my woofers,280 watt kenwood the left channel on the subs and right channel for the mids n tweets.these are very loud n clear how i have them hooked up .good sound for low price,the wire that came with it small,i used a lil bit bigger one think its better this way,more power transfer."
5,A handy book for quilters at all levels of computer knowled,"This book is a valuable resource for quilters at all levels of computer knowledge. It explains away a lot of the ""mysteries"" of why your computer acts the way it does and points you in various directions to research out your own particular interests. Written in an easy conversational tone, it imparts a lot of information without talking down or over your head."
3,Well...yes and no,"I've been quilting for almost 18 years and using the internet for 3. I love Judy and Gloria but internet guides are funny. They go out of date so fast. Save your money gals and use a good search engine instead. I like Metacrawler. It's much more fun than reading about the internet and you'll find oodles of information.Or better yet, buy Judy and Gloria's other book The Quilter's Computer Companion. You can find it here on Amazon. You'll get all of the same information and a lot more useful information too! I've been amazed with their other book. Everyone should have it on their shelf."
1,surf,This book had nothing new.. All of the websites can be found if you do a Google search. I'm very dissappointed in it..
3,Mediocre at best,"Sure, it's an inexpensive plastic toy periscope -- so I wasn't expecting it to be as good as, say, a submarine's periscope. However, even by plastic toy standards, this was highly unimpressive. The primary problem is that the field of view is *tiny*.Now, I admit, I don't know how challenging it is to make a periscope with a decent field of view, but the lack with this one makes it almost useless. You see so little when trying to look with it that you quickly give up, and I eventually had to hunt around on eBay until I found a used ""real"" periscope for my kids.Cheap plastic toy isn't a horrible thing -- if you're CHEAP. This should be five bucks, tops. It isn't. And given how poorly it performs, that's more than a little annoying."
2,Very cheap toy. Not a good value.,"Arrived with a small plastic tab broken off internally, even though the packaging was fine. A little glue and tape and it was working again, but this periscope is an extremely cheap toy, much cheesier than you would expect for the price. It's the sort of novelty you might pay <$5 for at a dollar store."
1,Not exactly safe and completely not durable,"As others have said: Don't expect to be able to see very much or very clearly. That's okay really - it was for a child who was really just pretending with it anyhow. What isn't okay, though, is that some days after he got it, the plastic outside piece that holds the mirror (you know, the rectangular SHARP-cornered piece of ""glass"") kept popping off. It holds the mirror with just 2 teeny clips and that mirror comes out of them awfully quick and easily. No matter how much I pay for something, I do not expect it to fall apart within days and more importantly, I don't expect it to be so shoddily made that it's a danger to my child. Yes, the piece can be snapped back on, then it falls off again within hours, with the mirror snapping out of its clips when it hits the floor, generally. It's been taken away - sorry, TOTALLY not safe."
4,Worked ok,"My son was expecting a better one, after they used a fancy one in his school. But it worked fine."
2,Not satisfied at all,"This product was of poor quality and did not come as described. Also, the item was already out of the original package when I received it. I was not satisfied at all with the item."
3,toy,just what i wanted the kids really like it they play with it allmost everday it made them very happy.
1,Do NOT buy,Do NOT but this item. The chuck key does not fit. You will have to find one that does! Once you open it it's yours.
2,Whisper Town,"As the Depression grips the nation, a young minister finds himself the accidental foster father to three orphans. Adding one more shouldn't be much different, but this child is very different. The baby girl abandoned on his doorstep is not white, but he is. To Jeb that makes no difference, but it makes a huge difference when he begins trying to find her a wet nurse and in his interactions with the town folk. Jeb and his make shift family find themselves plunged into a violent backlash of hatred and racism. Yet, this makes him all the more determined to hold true to his convictions and do right by the baby girl. Unfortunately, the overall book lives up to the era in which it is set, the Depression. Though historically accurrate, it's rather a downer, bringing up reminders of a world most would prefer to forget."
1,rip-off,This is so skinny and small all of the berries started to come off when I tried to fluff it up. You could make one of these for 10.00 dollars easy. I am sending this back. It is a joke. Too bad.
4,great razor,"I used to use and old Gillette for years, then went to Disposables. Bought this and remembered why I like safety razors so much. Clean close shave. Only complaint is handle is a little short."
5,Top of the Line Razor,Razor is great I have several merkur's and this one takes the cake. I finaly found the correct settings for myself and dial up razor on my last stroke to get thoese hard stubble and it take it right off. Case came cracked but vender gave me a $10 off discount which was fair but I really would of liked the case. or well.I would recomend this product. The germans lost the war but they sure one the razor debate.
1,Razor,"I thought the head was going to be adjustable and not the handle, so it wasn't what I was wanting at all."
1,used to love this razor,"This razor was great, being adjustable is a great feature. Unfortunately the chrome finish on one side of the head flaked off after less than a year of use. Shaving with just one side of the razor is not what I paid a premium price for. I also own the long handled Merkur razor which gives a great shave also."
2,He is better than this,"Steve Lawler is a dope DJ, don't get me wrong. It just seems as though he has changed his sound a lot on this CD (which I guess is one of the principal aims of a tier-1 DJ?). Steve Lawler's GU Nu Breed was huge, and it definitely made me appreciate the sound of tribal, sexy, funky beats. Dark Drums were also good works by Steve, particularly the second CD of DD 2. But this one has lost its tribal housey edge and replaced it with an electronic injection of samples and beats you would expect from Danny Howells or even Carl Cox. I don't like the faster, less deliberately layering that Lawler displays here. And it seems as though some of the other writers here agree with that as well. I don't know if he is trying to take a different step in his DJing, but he has more skills than this, and he is a premier DJ. Buy Dark Drums 2 or Nu Breed to get a better feel for Lawler."
2,Can someone say lemon?,"Um, obviously the Lawler fans are our in full force here. Yes, he does have a knack for picking good raunch. And there are some great numbers on CD 1. It's a shame they've been soured by the awful drone in between. If I really wanted this set to work I'd have to doctor it up quite a bit, and ditch the nod to electroclash. If only Lawler's taste in music were a bit more even."
2,Lights Have Gone Out for Lawler,"Steve Lawler was the last vestige of really good tribal house music....WAS being the operative word here. Despite what other reviewers have said, I don't find any saving grace on CD 2 !! This is not the next generation of Lights Out....and if it is let me off at the next stop cuz this bus is heading off the cliff !! This is pre-packaged velveeta, techno, glitter....it doesn't showcase Lawler's (formerly present) gifts for finding sexy, bumpin' hot tribal tunes that made you want to dance till you drop....nor does it showcase any particularly noteworthy mixing !! Sadly, LO2 is indicative of the overall decline of hot new commercially available house music. Steve used to break from the crowd however LO2 reflects exactly where the industry is going....goodbye clubland...it was fun while it lasted !!"
4,More of Brazilian takes by Sarah Vaughan: Just Great!,"This the second bunch of Brazilian standards by Ms. Vaughan who was backed by the same musicians as in the former album (titled 'I Love Brazil' here @Amazon). Features the great Helio Delmiro on guitar.All material is Bossa Nova except the title song, an old traditional samba and also a smash hit in Brazil. 4 out 8 tracks are compositions by Antonio Carlos Jobim. Also includes an Ivan Lins' smash hit 'Abre-Alas'."
1,What a piece of junk !,"A real crap. First, no sound. A technitian found the preamplifier down, and fixed it. After one week, the controller board is down. Very nice on photograph, but very bad quality, at least on assembly. I can`t give it back because I bought it through Internet in Venezuela, an freight will cost more than a new stereo. One hell of a lemon I got here."
2,Not much about moving,"This book is more for the retiree looking for things to do while spending half the year in Florida. Not much regarding actual moving advice. If you want a good primer to Florida's wildlife, this book spends 60 percent of itself talking about birds, alligators, and dolphins."
1,Disappointing,After reading all the good reviews I bought this book. I went to Florida and had very little useful information. The way it is written and the content are poor.
5,A tremendous resource of information,"What a terrific resource. Lots of useful and practical information about relocating to Florida, all in one place. It includes lots of personal observations and enough anecdotes to keep the reading breezy and enjoyable. I will refer to this before AND after the move!"
4,Now teenage girls can learn about making money,"Growing out of her studies of women entrepreneurs, Ms. Godfrey formed the group An Income of Her Own. The educational foundation is designed to level the playing field, by providing teenage girls with the same opportunities that teenage boys traditionally enjoy: namely, to learn at a young age how money is made. This book is full of hands-on ideas for educating girls in business on a local level. END"
5,great book,Dorothy Lyons is one of the best children horse stories ever. She wrote about a time when horsemen were really horsemen an not just merely riders of horses. There is a big difference.
4,Spiritual Astrology: Your Personal Path to Self-Fulfillment,"Good book, but not for the laymen. A great read though that is very informative."
4,"Easy to navigate, full of cultural references.","I like this book because it is divided into digestible segments that I actually enjoy doing. There are conversational parts, grammar parts, vocabulary sections, and information about S. Korean culture. There is just enough of each, though I would enjoy more practice dialogues. This book was widely used in the UC system, though I'm not sure what they use now, since it's been a decade or so. However, I understand why they did. It's a great book to learn the Korean language."
2,Very disappointed!!,We were so looking forward to getting this toy for our grandson and were extremely disappointed when while putting together one of the designs we found two pieces were missing. One of these pieces was needed to build ALL of the options so we were forced to go online and spend an extra $40 to get the required parts. They have yet to arrive. Our grandson was very disappointed...and so were we. I cannot recommend this seller for future purchases.
2,"Strong on theatrical detail, weak on mystery plot","I have enjoyed Ngaio Marsh mysteries in the past, and I am interested in Macbeth, so I was looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, as a mystery it was disappointing. The lead in to the murder took the first two-thirds of this confusingly over-populated book, with the murder itself almost an afterthought. The plot centered around the production of Macbeth, and not the victim or criminal. I cannot reveal the weakness of the plot without also revealing the ending, but the solution was so excessively convenient that I wound up very frustrated. The identity of both the murderer and the victim seemed largely a matter of coincidence and not of fate."
4,Thorough,"This thick volume contains stories from the last century. Each entry begins with a profile of the author, including his or her major works and a short biography, then has between 1 and 3 short stories. Afterwards, many entries have an essay by the author about the work, or have extensive information about the historical context of the story.This book strives to be complete, with selections of different styles of writing, various themes, and non-western as well as Western authors. It suceeds in this to a certain extant, but the majority of the stories are written by white American men. However, many other stories are included.Because of the size of this tome, it may be difficult for the reader to discover the very good stories buried admist the mediocre. Even a dedicated reader might get bogged down in the dozens mediocre stories about rape and lust, never finding the great stories that are also present."
4,"great,but not for kids you are trying to teach the correct words to","This is a great CD for Rugrat fans.Its so cute.The only reason I knocked off a star is because of Tommys silent night. It went on for over 5 minutes waaay to long.But if you are trying to teach the correct words to your kids,this will mess them up."
3,not a fan,I didnt like the graphics so I didnt watch it but I would imagine a young child would have loved it. :)
4,comfortable continuance of the series,"The first book in the final volume of Powell's monumental series (Book 1 of Winter). The characters that remain are almost like worn clothes, comfortable but showing some holes from the wear and tear at this point.Jenkins is reaching beyond middle age (for the WW II ere middle age, anyway) in this first installment of the final chapter. Pamela and Widmerpool continue to be mainstays, in intrigue successful and failing. It returns to form in that little of Jenkins' direct personal life is gone into, again concentrating on the circles he runs into. The birth of another child is mentioned in passing, while the affairs of a seldom mentinoed cousin would garner pages and pages of description. I feel Isobel, his wife, remains lesser known than any of the other female characters.Still, as much due to the previous books as any specific incidents within it, this volume seems to read faster."
5,"Spiritual, artistic bargain","This book contains wonderful photographs of people representing all cultures, ages and beliefs who share their personal ideas of God. Ideal for people searching for an understanding of God, especially for those who have been raised in a ""one correct belief"" system. Published by Hazelden for those seeking recovery. Books of comparable quality usually cost much more."
5,Ten Yard Fight rocks. A lot.,"Another winner for TYF. If you don't have this yet, go get it. This is the best of the best. The Boston hardcore/sXe scene is one of the greatest, and these guys are the one fo the best from good old MA. I repeat, this band and CD rock!"
2,Be cautious about the other reviews here,"I don't have arthritis and I am in no position to determine how effective the treatments listed in this book are. I have not read the book so I wish I could add my comment here without assigning any star rating to the book.Just be aware that none of the prior five star reviewers of this book say that they found it useful, or that they even heard of someone who read the book, applied the principles and was cured.The reviews that are prior to 2012 sound more like fake testimonials. Be wary of five star reviews that are so generic to the point of being meaningless. This appears to be an effort to boost sales."
4,Soloist par excellence,"A superb album from a real virtuoso with a magic touch, wonderful improvisatory skills and irresistible rhythm. The transfer to CD is outstanding. The missing star? Tatum as good as they come (or have been) as soloist, but not the most empathetic accompanist."
2,STEP BACKWARDS but has bells and whistles,"I used Visual Studio 6 / Visual Interdev a lot and found it very good. I'm a decent VB programmer so I created several apps and managed our corporate website /sub webs with it too. I could do all that my business group needed. VS.NET 2003 has just made all that a lot, lot harder for not much gain. Aside from learning the new languages VB.NET and C# which I don't really mind the new asp.net and web site development is horrendous for people who do it all themselves. It was a lot simpler before. First time you try to delete a test project you won't find a delete option or anything in the help about it. It turns out you need to use explorer to delete the files and IIS to remove the virtual site. Why would they do that? In short the gains are mainly for the big enterprise users with 2003 servers running IIS6. $$$. Very disappointing really and I really like Microsoft stuff. Microsoft SQL server is fantastic for instance. Good luck and be prepared to study..."
1,Why would I buy this?,"Can someone please explain why I would buy .Net Pro when the MSDN Pro subscription is cheaper and comes with much more? Frankly, both of them see highly overpriced. They should pay me to develop for their platform."
4,The beauty of noise,"This is a very creative album from an eclectic group out of Iceland of all places. Heavy, atmospheric scream-core music that makes you think of sharp objects: broken glass, needles, scrap metal, etc. It's a pain to listen to but a joy to behold. Buy it now and begin pissing off your neighbors right away; they may look at you funny...oh if they only knew..."
4,Jesus Christ Minus!,This album is nothing less than an amazing metalcore album. Never for a minute when you listen to this CD do you feel bored. This CD will grind against your skull just as Atreyu and Boy Sets Fire do when you listen to them. Not to mention the voice effects that they use on songs like Misdo. Don't hesitate to buy this album. You WILL enjoy.
4,Unique,"This event had some good fights in it. The Mezger/Otsuka rematch wasn't the barnburner I expected but the rest of the matches made up for it. The novelty of seeing everyone slipping and sliding while fighting is worth the price of this DVD. The undercard fights on this tape are really what make it a good buy. The other big name fight on this DVD, the Ricco Rodriguez fight, wasn't that exciting either.If you're a serious MMA fan, you'll definitely want this in your collection. Order it."
5,Product is far superior to all the others offered out there,"...and at a price a student can afford. The intuitive structure and the reality of the interviews make you feel like you're with new friends you've just met traveling. It moves at just the right pace -- from beginner to more advanced levels so that the confidence builds quickly and before you know it, you're speaking French with confidence. I'm traveling to France this summer and can't wait to practice. I wholeheartedly recommend it."
4,A competent teaching aid,"As compared with other French learning programmes, SmartFrench rates high in my view. Phonetics and meaning go hand in hand in an interactive approach that takes the learner gradually into the language. The package is user friendly and efficient. I am happy to recommend it to anyone investing money and effort in learning French."
3,Not What I Was Looking For...,"Wanting to begin learing French, I spent a lot of time looking for a program to help me. I saw that SmartFrench had 5 stars and was relatively cheap. It looked like a good product, so I bought it. Unfortunatly, it was not very helpful. It simply has you recite French conversations. It has no vocabulary and no grammar. Perhaps listening to and reciting interviews in French is a good way to brush up on a language, or perfect your pronunciation, but it is simply not a good way to actually LEARN the language. This program may have a ""beginner"" level, but if you are a new to French and are considering getting this product, please learn from my mistake. This program is NOT FOR BEGINNERS."
3,"It's not the best turorial, then again, not the worst.","[...]The program is mainly just based on conversations between French speakers. The bundled 60pg book contains mainly the text that is already incorporated into the conversations within the weak program.The bundle lacks actual vocabulary practice and conjugation rules. I'd advice that people only buy SmartFrech only to supplement other, more defined packages such.LearnFrench Now 9 is a much better program, and DOES have better information on conjugation and on vocabulary."
5,Amazing way to advance in learning French,"This is an amazing way to advance in learning French whether you are a beginner or like me need to brush up your french knowledge. What is astounding is the methodology used. A unique brilliant way that guides you with ease on the way you can speak French as the French do and in so doing comprehending French very easily.All the way from Beginner to Advanced you are given the linguistic tool of being aware of the nuances you must choose to perfect your accent and understanding.This is done by live interviews - always appealing because of the variety of people and jobs, their interests and humour. Never dull. Unlike most French courses offered this one does give you a leap forward. I think Christian Aubert has succeeded in recognising how the non native speaker can be made aware of how easy it is to speak French and understand it because of his acute awareness of what people think they hear and how to recognise it."
5,Excellent course to learn french,"I found what I was looking for!! Finally, here is a course that told me how to speak French! What a difference it makes! I am finally learning French! It might be a little difficult for the true beginner but I wish I had bought it sooner. It's better to get it right away, practice with it once and eventually keep it preciously for later. You will not find such a nice product on the market very often."
5,It proved itself,"I just returned from Paris, where, for the first time, I was able to understand Parisian French, and even to make myself understood-all thanks to SmartFrench! Although not the best tool for someone who knows nothing about French, SmartFrench made it possible for me to hear French as it's actually spoken, and to improve my pronunciation. It's fun, it's fast, and it's effective!"
1,What a Joke,"This program is a total waste. All it is, is French Conversations that you read along with. It TEACHES you nothing. Don't waste your money."
4,good book,good story and well told there aren't many books written in this time period it was refreshing to read it
3,still reading,not to sure about this book. they story is slow and all over the place.. some of the comments are to modern.. more like the authors opinion than the charactors in the story.
1,Not accurate,"My level was not accurate; measurements are noticeably skewed to one side. These types of levels are self-calibrating, in the sense that if you rotate them 180 degrees, they should remain consistent. I'm not sure if it is the bottom surface of the device that is not perfectly level, or if it is the bottom of the clear plastic top that isn't. Either way, it's not a good thing."
3,Where is the surround sound???,"Although Exodus and Gary Holt are one of the preeminent thrash bands and the Video is great, songs are great, stage presence is great....The sound is STEREO, why would a band/management/label not cut a Dolby/DTS track is beyond me. After all this is AUDIO experience. I purchased the DVD and I'm a long-term fan of Exodus, didn't check the audio format (assumed they got it). Played the DVD in my Polk 7:1 system and it sounded like crap.Now I plan to run it through sim-surround.To add insult to injury, the LABEL INTRO is in DTS. Which of course makes the band sound even worse. I do hear the foundation there.Message to NUCLEAR ASSAULT - MARKET YOUR BAND-DO NOT CUT CORNERS-THIS IS EMBARRASSING!!!I have met Gary and partied with him on the Kreator Tour. They are playing in Florida on 9/5 and I plan to ask him about this - can't wait for the blank expression.How dare you screw up this effort by Exodus!!!!!"
1,Zoot Sims himself NOT on this recording,We were very disappointed that the record company released this album using Zoot Sims name and him not even playing on it. Not until you open the CD can you read the names of the musicians of which Zoot Sims is not one of them!
1,Truly aimed at Dummies,"This book wastes too much space trying to be hip and funny ""Dummies"" style. While it's a nice quick-read introduction of what's new in OS X, there is very little in the way of nuts and bolts. For example, you won't be able to configure Mail using this book, or figure out how to wend your way through the new multiple-users security system. Just when it starts to get meaty the author says something like ""but that's beyond the purview of this book"" or ""this book is too short to cover this in detail."" (Well, it wouldn't be if they didn't waste so much space with quips and cliches.)Read this one at the library...you can do it in an hour. Then spend a few bucks more and get THE MISSING MANUAL."
1,Ratio of useful info to bad jokes very low,"This book is filled with overly cute writing and bad jokes. Like radio talk show hosts, Levitus and Brisbin take every opportunity to say something they think is funny. This kind of writing makes it very difficult to follow any thread of useful information. I'm very sorry that I bought this book."
3,"go for the package, not the CD","go for the package if you really a bilingual fan! the CD is simply a selection from live at Ritz 1986 and Boston 88 and wild animal 77, the most desirable live of china girl is actually from 86 not a particularly contemporary live.if you don't have any iggy's live, and you don't care the package, go to the original greatest hits live, or other best of live, not this one. but if you care about the package, and you can afford it, go for it."
2,Average,"Bite Club was a moderately fun book that resorted to the use of tired sterotypes to achieve humor. The story involves a gay vampire, his mostly human lover, and their eccentric friends on a mad chase around West Hollywood in search of a rogue vampire. Rather than fully developing his characters, Bodner falls back on a series of cliches to describe them (gay men wearing leather and dressing in drag, overweight people continuously eating at any given moment). Curiously, the most interesting parts of the novel come when the story shifts to a secondary female vampire character across the country helping in the hunt for the rogue vampire. Here the humor is more subtle and feels less forced. Her interactions with other supernatural creatures give the reader much more insight into the world the author attempts to create. This section sadly never comes to any full conclusion however and ends abruptly."
3,"Not my cup of tea, or jazz.","I bought tis because I heard an other record that I liked very much, with Davis as a sideman. I did not know his music so I looked for something that features his Sax work.It was recorded in two sessions about a year apart back in the late 70's. He doesmaster his instrument, but it just was not the kind of jazz I like. I am having trouble putting it into words, but he just did not connect with me. I guess I like the early Coltrane and anything by Yardbird. (I did grow up in Kansas City) I know this is not very helpful if you are considering whether or not you want this record."
3,A New Take on the Slasher in the Woods,"You might think that you've already seen every possible permutation of the mad slasher stalking the young couple in the woods. However this film, ""based on real events,"" does put a new twist on the theme.The couple's floundering in the woods gets a little repetitious, and you might think you are guessing the secret of their dilemma. But you probably won't know the whole truth of the matter until the very last frame.So this film is marginally worth sticking with. But there's another, better film out there with the same title, ""Dead of Winter."" (Producers seem to be recycling titles with increasing rapidity.) This somewhat older film, starring Mary Steenburgen and Roddy McDowall, is much slicker, more clever - and more frightening. So if you just have time for one chilling snow job - make it the Steenburgen/McDowall film."
3,"GOOD ACTING, GOOD SOUNDTRACK, ATMOSPHERIC","Let's be fair, this movie deserves a three star rating. Good acting, atmospheric background affect, good soundtrack. These no talent idiots who give it less then three stars, what have they done as far as movies are concern themselves. Hate over zealous critics, who have no resume to show the rest of the world and have nothing better to do then put others down. Jealous morons. This movie was enternaining to me. Shows what can happen to you on dangerous drugs, so it does send a message, so there you less then three stars jerks. I want the soundtrack."
1,Absolutely awful!,"Don't even bother wasting your time or money on this ridiculously stupid movie. The plot and story is beyond silly/non-believable and the acting...if you want to call it that, is no doubt the worst you could ever imagine! I can't even believe someone was stupid enough to waste resources on such a piece of crap movie. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give this stoop-fest a minus 1000! My 10 year old kid could have written a better movie than this turd."
4,OLD SCHOOL ICE - T,"Old Old School Ice!, January 11, 2004Reviewer: Scotty from United KingdomI bought this CD originally for 2 trax.Tibetan Jam and Reckless.These were missing from my Ice T collection and were apparrently electro classics, a scene I remember from my teenage years.The other trax on the disc were welcome bonuses.Killers is an early example of message rap in a similar vein to Grandmaster Flash and of course the classic 6 'N The Mornin',perhaps the original gangsta rap tune, is here in its original form.The only weak link in the collection is the mix at the end which is why I rated 4 stars.All in all a good collection of early to mid-eighties Ice T.1.

4,Mafiosos - Fo tha money,"A pretty under rated old school bay area album, that has good beats & very decent lyrics"
5,Great MP3 player,"This player is easy to use and load music to. No music sync program required. Just plug into a USB port and drop and drag music files from your computer. Uses one AAA battery, I use a rechargable. Also usefull as a flash drive."
3,Little mp3 player is great for my kids.,"This mp3 has worked out great for my son. He just wants to listen to ""his"" music. With this mp3 he can do that without interrupting the rest of the family. The player is not so good if you want to find one specific song or artist to play."
4,not bad for the price,this is not a bad little player for the price if you have even a little bit of tech know how and are on a budget and hate Ipods and the like the even sell them at Dollar General now for $18 but alot of package for such a small little thing lmao. it was easy to set up the driver that comes with the player and then get songs onto the player was no prob just drag and drop files or folders as you would any other type of flash drive just make sure you make and modify your folders and files on your computer and not once there on the player the ear buds are not too bad and i am part def in both ears to boot and yes rechargable batteries are a must and with something this cheap there are bound to be a few defective ones and what do we want for chinese companies these days with all the recalls lol over all not a bad player for the money although the controlls could be better but then again for the price what do you want people a gold plated scan disk player or ipod sheesh
1,disatisfied,"Well, I recieved the product promptly, but the compartment for the battery was not easy to figure out how to get off. THen, I have two of them for both of my kids. One of them constantly shorts out and the other one occasionally does so. It has been very frustrating for me and my boys."
3,It's OK for an 8 year old,"I purchased this for my [...]son, and for the price it's not too bad.It's very easy to use. You just plug it into the USB port on you PC and copy the songs over. You can use either Windows Explorer or MP3 player software. I used MusicMatch. There is no cable to loose.The controls are simple to use as well. My son has no problems using it.The only thing I didn't like about it is the headphones. They are very cheap and have terrible sound quality. I had an old pair laying around the house and used them, and it sounded just fine.I wouldn't have purchased this for myself, but as an inexpensive player for a child, it's not bad."
2,No help for Home and Biz,I thought this book would have info for ALL versions of MS Money 2003. Not. No mention of any of the biz version at all.
3,Good with older computers,"I don't think it's fair to malign this card for not being compatible with OS 10.4--the newest operating system Apple has. There simply isn't lots out there for pre-airport macs; certainly, if you have a computer that can or might run OS 10.4, don't get this card. The Apple G3 powerbook I installed the card onto couldn't use OS 10.4 or a newer model card, so it was perfect for that machine.That said, it was a pain to install the card with Verizon DSL; I took it to another location with Comcast cable service, configured it there, and then it worked fine with Verizon. So, it's not perfect. But don't expect an older product to work with the latest and greatest operating software!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"Whatever you do, don't buy this card. I've had one for a year, it worked great. Unfortunately Macsense has abandoned it, they are no longer doing driver development and it DOES NOT WORK with Mac OSX 10.4. I've discussed this with Macsense and they have no plans to upgrade the drivers to continue working with future versions of OS X, so it's worthless. Buy a card from a bigger company that will continue to support their products."
4,Good For Practice,"This CD ROM was helpful in that you could start practicing for the new computer based testing. They do have explanations for why the answer is right, but do not explain why the wrong answer is wrong. Otherwise, questions were good, picture questions were also just as good. I have tried other step 2 software, and this is definitely the better of them. It's worth it to get practice."
1,Total Rip off,The questions are obsolete and dated. The product format does not reflect the current exam format at all and for the number of questions I think it is over priced. There is far better software CD's available out there to help train people who are taking CBT - USMLE exams.
5,"Move Over, Lenny!","This is an extraordinary set of ""Paris"" symphonies by Haydn performed by Nick Harnoncourt and his Concentus Musicus Wein. The only recordng in my collection up until this point was the old NYPO with Lenny. It is comprised of three CDs with two symphonies on each. Why? Nick honors ALL the repeats. The result is more than three hours of music. But Nick manages to make it interesting. None of the performances feel long-drawn-out. And I heard things I never heard before, so for me there was a new sense of discovery. I took a gamble in getting this set because Nick can be an erratic interpreter when it comes to Haydn or Mozart. But this set is a homerun. Concentus Musicus Wein plays with polish, clarity and precision. The woodwinds are especially luscious."
2,Brash and Loud,"This set has received many glowing reviews. Here is the other side, from someone who likes many, but not nearly all, HIP (historically informed performance) approaches to music. I found this set too loud, too brash, and utterly lacking in charm, grace, subtlety, and beauty of tone. Yes, Haydn has often been over-refined in other performances, robbing the music of Haydn's joyous wit and interesting textures. However, to my ears, this set goes way overboard in the other direction. I could recommend this only to those who are firmly in the HIP camp and who value excitement and verve above all else and who therefore don't think Haydn should be at all subtle, dry, or easy on the ears."
4,Dears The complete series,the only problem with this series is that it is way too short. One didn't want it to end as quickly as it did. The Dears were a race of alien slave women on their home planets. The people of Earth thinks they were only servants as they crash on earth unable to return and become citizens of Japan. When Rei a reject Dear's suspended animation capsule breaks off the ship and wash ashore she is the first Dear to truly find a master even if the other Dears want her captured or destory to keep their secrets from accidently leaking out. The series is full of adult human like a teacher who comes on to her students in her under wear and makes the kids read pron in school. Other than the few adult spots its over all a wonderful series.
4,its a cute anime,this anime is something you should watch with your openminded girl friend. not porn but not for kids ither lol. the fan service is enuff to keep you captivated lol. if you like cute pervy anime this is for you.
1,Too Instructional for little ones,"This is suppose to be a video for babies and toddlers, yet they are forcing instruction. I am a coach and former athlete recognizing that instruction should not come to children prior to school age. I am disguisted by the way parents today are burning their children out. I have found other similar videos that introduce children to sports in a fun playful manner. Can not recommend this video!!"
5,Tyler loves this video!!!!!!,"This has got to be the best 16 dollars I have ever spent on my son Tyler. Tyler wants to be like his daddy and play golf and this video makes him feel all grown up, helps him use the terminology, and swing the club correctly. He loves to putt on his daddy's practice green now because of the video. Mia, my 1 year old is barely walking but is already carrying around the club and points at the screen when the Tiger comes up - she loves him! Can't wait for soccer to come out! BRAVO to the minds behing this great video."
5,Great Video!,"I bought this for my husband who loves golf and wanted to get a head start with Connor, our 15 month old grandson. He has picked up his plastic clubs and is swinging them all over the house! It is so cute. He is starting to talk and some of his words are golf words -- a little Tiger Woods in the making??? Definitely recommended!!!!"
5,Very fun for kids to watch,"My daughter, 13 months, loves watching this video. The instruction is very, very light. Telling kids to swing ""back and thru"" or that when you hit off a tee it's called ""driving"" or that when you roll the ball that's called ""putting"".My daughter had already shown interst in her plastic clubs and I believe this has helped her learn from watching to swing the club and not pounded it like a hammer on the ground. It's also got fun annimations and lots of kids hitting balls. It's even got a section on animals that you might see on the course."
1,About average,There are MUCH better books in this category. This one just doesn't do the topic justice.
3,"Good, but there are better","This is a good book. It is very interesting subject, and the qualifactions of the authors is without doubt. But. There is a but. It is not great. It could be more readable, it could cover more ground, it could have a lot more examples than 'simon' who is some never identified cyclist. If you search for flow, zone, deep play, inner game and sports you will find plenty of books that are not just good, but great."
5,Yeah! It's back in print.,"Several years ago my husband and I were disappointed to find that the d'Aulaire's book had gone out of print. (We wanted to be able to read it to our children.) We found a very used copy and bought it because, despite this copy's poor condition, the book was very hard to find. Now we will be able to replace it with a copy that is in one piece.The stories are well researched and well told. The illustrations are great--if you are familiar with other works by the d'Aulaires you will know what I mean. This is a great Norse mythology for children."
3,"Excellent content, disappointing book quality","The tales are well written and beautifully, lovingly illustrated. However, the volume itself is printed on cheap paper--experience tells me that in a few years this kind of paper begins to yellow, especially around the edges, and some years later, to fall apart. I was hoping this would be a more permanent addition to my collection. I would rather have paid more and had better quality; I feel as if the publisher has short-changed me and didn't do justice to this wonderful work."
1,"Great book, terrible edition","Great book as stated by most everyone and beautiful illustrations - However the quality of the book itself is truly a shame. The cover is OK but the paper used for pages is so thin you can see through the print of the next page. I recommend searching used editions of this book published by Doubleday books - The original title was ""Norse Gods and Giants"". You'll be assured to get the same great book (story/illustrations) but on quality printed paper if this is important to you."
5,A must own for any family with children!,"I grew up reading these stories and the fabulous illustrations were a memorable part of my childhood reading. I now teach a mythology class in high school, and we loved using this book! Wonderful for all ages."
2,Dull,"My eight-year-old daughter and I really enjoy reading D'Aulaire's Greek Myths together. These Norse Myths, however, lack good story telling. There's no emotion, no fun, no intrigue, no excitement to the stories -- the writing is dull. I'm sure Norse Myths are interesting, but you wouldn't know it from this book."
3,Dated,"A complex cast of characters with unpronounceable names adventuring through the worlds of the Yggdrasil, vaulting from story line to story line, proved to be just too distracting. My grandson (10), who is very much into medieval legends, science fiction and super heroes, found it very little more engaging."
5,Wow our whole family loved this book!,"We didn't know much about Norse myths when we bought this book but we sure do now! We've been reading this book, one story every night, together and it is not only well written but the illustrations are very cool too. I had D'Aulaires' book of greek myths when I was a young girl and LOVED it, continued looking at the illustrations long after I read the stories, so I took a chance on buying this one. We're all glad we did!"
5,Another great D'Aulaires book,"Just another great D'Aulaires book! If you or you children like myths or if you want to introduce them to myths, then the D'Aulaires are the way to go. We started with their Greek myths book, which is well worn now; first reading the stories to my children and then them taking over and reading themselves.I was able to finally get my 5th grader to move away from the Greeks with this book. She loves this new set of myths and is willing to read the Romans now!"
5,One of the best!,This is a fabulous collection of Norse Myths. They are written to be enjoyed by young people as well as adults. The D'Aulaire illustrations are wonderful. I have used this book for teaching and just to enjoy the myths for myself. A great addition to any personal or educational library.
4,Disappointed,"Still love it, but I don't see why in this age of techonological marvel, this set could not be unedited...some of the best laughs this classic offers are often edited...Paramount owes everyone...for this. The fact this set is edited is the reason I did not give four stars."
4,I love this tape but....,also wonder why they cut the episodes....some of my favorite parts of the show are when the Darlings and Andy are playing together. Find myself tapping my toe and loving it...so all I would say is that if the fourth season has cut episodes I won't be buying it
4,At least they're honest...,"If this set had been completely intact I would have given it 5 stars, but I had to knock 1 star off for the edits. I'm glad Paramount at least had the integrity to put a warning on the box, albeit in fine print. Not that true fans wouldn't have noticed anyway; Paramount would have suffered more fan backlash if they had not included the warning. I hope there will be no need for any such warnings on future sets."
2,You can't go wrong with this...,"We have several Andy Griffith DVD collections, and this is just another great one. It is the great comedy that you expect from Don Knotts and Andy Griffith. This is a black and white classic of all time and would highly recommed to any fan."
3,There's more than one episode edited!!!!,"Someone on the TAGSRWC bulletin board jogged my meory. There WAS an epilogue to ""Barney Mends a Broken Heart"" where Miss Peggy was tending Andy's black eye! And that epilogue IS SHOWN ON TV LAND!!!!And the reviewer who said there's a brief dialogue exchange missing with Otis where he says he's celebrating the anniversary of his first drink in ""Barney and the Governor"" is correct.So there's no excuse for this. I'm torn between enjoying having the set (this was a GREAT season) and siding with the reviewer who says that if you buy this set in edited form you're telling Paramount that you don't care and they don't have to bother with complete episodes. I think at the very least every fan should write a STRONG letter saying that we won't buy FUTURE edited sets."
3,Why not uncut season three,This is my first review and I'm completely shocked to see that they would cut anything from these episodes. Feel like I've been cheated. Why would they cut from this season when the first 2 seasons were completely uncut as far as I could see. Not sure I'll buy season 4 or not. Complete uncut episodes are at the top of my wish list. Could they try this again?
5,Good old fashioned family fun.,Classic wisdom and humour that I never have to worry about when my children are viewing anytime. Love Andy and his sweet witty ways.
5,Good Clean Fun,Perfect for the whole family! No worries what your family might see or hear. We watch them together over and over again.
4,Excelent exercises,"I don't have much time to do exercise, but with this DVD of Cindy is very easy to me wake 20 or 30 min earlier and do my exercises before go to work. Cindy looks great on it! exercises are easy, it has an initial fase (flexibility) that let you understand the difficult of the exercises and also you can know if you're ready for this ""new dimension"". Recommendable 100%"
1,New Dimension,"I was not pleased with this video. I have Cindy's Shape Your Body and The Next Challenge. I liked both of them much more than this tape. I felt the sessions were long and some of the moves were awkward and difficult. Her prior videos were slick and exciting. This one was very frumpy. I did however love the shots of her child. If given an opportunity to choose again, I wouldn't pick this tape."
2,"Not enough of a ""work out""","I am a mother of a new baby boy and purchased this workout video to get back in shape after giving birth 5 months ago. It was not enough of a work out...I barely broke a sweat and I am not in shape these days, so I felt like it wasn't enough to get my body back into shape. If I can find precious almost non exsistent time to workout, I want to know it is going to work. Only did it once and went back to my old videos that I know will give results.The video was very chaotic and confusing, neither of the women explained any of the excercises so it was very difficult to do them correctly."
1,Not Happy Buyer,"I have ""The Next Challenge"" and ""Shape Your Body"" I was so excited of having a new workout...Mmmm... What a disappointment I got. Not what I wanted. Its a workout for mothers that just had a baby. If you want a workout that you'll love get one of the other 2."
2,such a waste of time...,"I did better exercising in kindergarden.... In deed, this is a tape for new moms... It's an excuse for exercising, so you don't feel guilty that you're not doing anything about the extra pounds. But if you want to shape your body, don't waste your money..."
1,"overblown visual affects, not an honest title","it appears cindy c did this video for the money, because she has no business being the STAR of this workout. She looked ok SIX months after delivering, but that is not fair to women and is being untrue to her words. She sold out to make this, and with all the wild affects, it should win an emmy or something for all the great beuaty shots, i think more time was spent on the production than the actualu choreography of this workout. I'd suggest something else, like a Leisa Hart video."
2,Only for women after delivery,"To tell you the truth I did not like this DVD because it is not as challenging as the <NEW CHALLANGE> I guess it is awesome for those dealing with the ""after I had a babay"" aftermath. One day I have a baby I will use this DVD but for now it is too easy...more relaxing... There are three different workouts, A, B, and C, C is the ""hardest"".Cindy looks great! She filmed it three months after she had a baby. Most of women would not ever look that good even before their pregnancy. So - for the women who had a baby - this is for you ! Enjoy and remember - your husband wants you to look as he remembers you when he married you -so lose your pouds! You have Cindy to hekp you!"
3,Wasn't real impressed!,"I think this is the worst tape out of her 3 work out tapes. I think it is best for beginners, I didn't relize how much it was geared for post pregnancy. I have been using Cindy's 2 other tapes for the past 3 years and love them. I was a little disappointed in this one. After doing her 2 other tapes and getting a great strong work out , this one seems to come off weak in comparison. I did like the small portion of aerobics that she threw in, but other then that I wasn't real impressed. I hope if she is going to make another tape she will use Radu again, I think he's great."
4,This is a post-PREGNANCY tape!!!,"I checked this tape out from the public library. I had no idea it was a post-pregnancy tape; but I tried it anyways, to see how it was.It consists of 3 workouts, A, B, C.workout A has some stretching, workout B, has some more stretching, and workout C is the real 'workout'.its about 45mins long, has the usual warm-up, then its arms/lunges and some cardio sets, some more arms and buns/abs and then a cool down.This tape doesn't look hard when you first watch it, but when you actually do it, it can be a good workout.I like this tape, I specially like the arms and abs parts.But i really don't think that this tape will get you back in shape! you need more cardivascular! this is more of a change of pace tape!The background is nice, it's in some living room and changes to the beach; the trainer (Kathy Kaehler) is always there with Cindy, and the music is good."
4,Not just for women who have had a baby!,"I've never had a baby but I have had 2 accidents which left me injured and out of shape almost 2 years later. As a former advocate of Step (Cher's 'A New Attitude') workouts and Cindy's last workout tape, 'The Next Challenge', I needed a program which would help me build up strength in my body *and* get back into shape.This tape has a really good learning curve and is especially good for anyone who hasn't worked out in a while. It really encouraged me to see that Cindy seemed to get tired out too. I have to admit that I skipped the push-ups (never could do those!) as they were too hard for me but it's good to have something I can grow into.This workout is definitely not just for women who have just had a baby! My gripe? Why no DVD release?"
1,not impressed,I guess cindy crawfords body type is not to my liking anyway; she is in shape; but not sexy. I just checked this out for the heck of itMaybe it is good for a beginner; but I am an advanced body builder and prefer a sexy sculpted body.
3,For Moms,I got this video as a package with the Shape Your Body video and I have to tell you that if you're not a mom you may want to skip this. It really focuses on being pregnant and post pregnancy loss - I couldn't relate as a non-mother and though the work out was pretty good it wasn't what I was looking for. Cindy's workouts are great though - try the other ones with Radu.
4,Good for moms,"I have two kids ages 2 and 4. My body has changed since the second kid. This video really helps the stomach pouch you get with the second kid. The music is decent and there are 3 workouts. I usually do the main workout which is 41 minutes long. Sometimes I do the workout B (16 minutes) along with the main workout. This workout is good for moms who want to get fit. It will make you sweat but it is a decent workout. You will need two 3 pound weights, a mat, playing cards and a chair. If you want to tighten up this video will help."
4,Don't underestimate this gem,"...Workouts A & B are snoozers, but, consider this video if you are just getting started, and not ready to join the thong-clad-kick-boxing crowd. When I started working out this was fairly simple, unintimidating and effective. You will move ahead fairly quickly so pass it on to a friend in need when you are ready for a more intense workout. I used heavier weights in the upper body workout(use caution work up to it). I liked her self deprication style and -- what do you know -- she's a little bit klutzy like me.Try it, you might like it if you are starting out or starting over."
4,This is probably more healpful if you are a new mom,"I was a little bit dissapointed with this tape. I have workout to cindy's other fittness tapes and i have grown attached to her. But not all of this tape was inefficiant the second and expecialy the third section of the tape really had great tonning excesises. I felt the cardio secion of the tape were a bit weak but it does have awsome moves for your abs, arms and [rear]. Those four count pushups KILL!!! Really i like the tape for the tonning but not to burn calories. I will probably save it after i have a child and do it riligously it seems like a very good tape for a new mom. Also i think cindy is sooooo much more personal and realaxed in this video as opposed to her last ones I overall really like this tape."
5,Seeing results!,"I already reviewed this earlier when I first starting using it, but now it has been about 3 weeks and just wanted to say I am definitely seeing results. I am not a new mom, youngest is 21/2 but I have found this workout works regardless. I usually run on my treadmill about every other day but have really never done any strengthing exercises with weights, situps, pushups, etc. I have been doing Workout C consistently 4 times a week and I feel so much stronger. I can do all the pushups now, whereas when I first started I could only do 2. The situps still kill me, so am still working on them! There's not a lot of cardio work but for toning and strengthening its great. I am thoroughly enjoying this workout!"
5,Great tie down system,"I love the E-track system in my new motorcycle trailer and the tie offs work great. Got them very quickly from the time I ordered them and they are exactly as shown. Not only do I tie down my bike with them, I load the area behind my bike with all my gear and tie that down with them also. I went from FL to TN loaded down and not a thing moved... it's a great system."
1,I want the old ones back!!!!,My family and I loved the old Duncan Hines blueberry muffins with streusel topping and I bought the new kind (whole grain) right after they came out and didn't even notice that it was different... we all took one bite and everyone thought I had done something crazy to the mix... me included... but it was the new mix... it is just awful... it has a heavy almost greasy taste and nothing could make it work... we all threw them away and nobody wants them ever again... very sad it was a Saturday morning ritual for us and we all miss it a lot... but not bad enuff to eat those awful things!! I am not sure why they messed with perfection???
4,romance without the sugar coma,"i bought this book for a particular story that i had heard one evening on selected shorts on npr. the name of the story was ""how to give the wrong impression"" by katherine heiny. it's a cute quirky little story. having been read aloud to me it was enough for me to buy the book and read the rest of the stories contained within by the other authors. i enjoyed woody allen's contribution. i never knew he wrote short stories....lol. there were a few favorites and others that linger on the edge of your mind for awhile. it's definitely worth picking up and looking at. there is certainly a story within to suit almost any taste in romance. i wish it were that easy in finding romance in real life."
5,Perfect Gift for the Reader in your Life,"If you care about someone who reads the New Yorker, this is the perfect gift. These clever short stories explore the topic of romantic love. This collection will introduce you writers you may never have read before. Great variety: tongue in cheek, serious, witty, quirky, mysterious... The collection explores the many dimensions of love."
5,Oh my goodness!,This book was so exciting I couldn't put it down. Read the whole book in one day. I think I have found my new favorite author!
1,The opposite end of the scale.....,"I bought this book because of all of the wonderful 5 star reviews from the other readers, but I honestly could not get into it. I really liked Nick and all his interactions with the other people in town were good, but when it came between him and Kathryn it seemed so stilted. I did not like Kathryn. Maybe that's why this book did not keep my interest. I forced myself to read to the halfway mark and finally just put it down to move on to something else. I have very little free time to read and when I do I want something that is going to grip my attention and not let it go until the back cover is turned. This just did not do it."
4,Whats REALLY Going on between Khartoum and Bagdad?,"A lucid account which unravels the complexity of Africa's difficulties. This book is far more than another bit of mounting evidence of atrocities against prosperous Black Africans recently documented by the UN.This book simplifies the daunting complexity of the Sudanese Civil War, and brings the reader a veteran african missionary's love for both Arab and Black African People Groups. The peacemaking missions between Moderate Arab muslims and Black Christians and animists are present paradigms for people of all races."
1,Hands off the Heartland of all Blacks,"to the author: i'm an independent Sudanese American researcher, in Sudan History&Culture:Would you go one on one with me on this ""slavery"" issue?in the mean time please answer these questions:(*)What does Sudan or ""Bilad Al Sudan"" means? (*)Based on what, you call those from the North Arabs, and those in the South Blacks? (*)This agony is the fruit of the westren clonial jungels all over Africa and Sudan is no exception. ..so Why are you silent when it comes to the role played by the west? for the Sudanes it was the west who set up this time bomb,in the first place..and this ""Slavery"" thing is nothing but an other Trojan horse, in the upcoming water war. Sincerely, Bashasha"
2,Yawn,"Not terribly well written, this is a compilation of baseball anecdotes. Few of them were new to me, and most were verbosely expounded upon. This does a disservice to many of the stories which would be best as shorter, pithier anecdotes. Also, there is nothing to separate the good, funny stories from the mild happenstances that are stretched for a page or two without anything more to gain. Don't waste your time."
2,Clearly not up to par,"With all the great writing associated with baseball this book is clearly at the bottom of the pile. Lot's of little cute stories, most of which are not than funny nor interesting.Also be sure to know...this is not the Cardinal third baseman"
3,its cool,nothing ground breaking or earth shattering however all in good fun and some of the stories are fairly common place and you will enjoy it for what it is. lighthearted and a quick read that i was glad to have upon finding it a book store.
5,Greatest book,This would be a great book to read if you are going somewhere far away. It has the best short story's about baseball players and they are really humours. My favorite story I read was when the Toronto Blue Jay's outfielders threw a baseball at a segall and killed it. This was the best book I read.
1,The worst most dangerous book,"This book is poorly written and dangerously flawed. There is a photo showing an infected cheek and it it labeled as Herpes. This is an error. The photo is of Impetigo. This is a very dangerous mistake. There is a section in this book that has the back muscles listed in the wrong area of the back. There is another diagram where the eyebrows are mislabeled. The reveiw book is just wrong is so many instances. To the authors the book, Fix this! This book sets a very low standard for estheticians and then provides a faulty education. I am ashamed. I am also afraid to read this book and study from it for my test."
3,Cheap but not in good shape,I received my book and opened it to find massive water damage and writing all over the pages. I would rather have purchased a new book had I known this one was so over used. It was cheap but still....
4,Milady's Standard: Fundamentals for Estheticians,I bought this book for my skincare class and so far it's been great. Wish it would expand more on the facial massage but so fra it's great.
3,Not great,I expected more from this movie and was disappointed. Didn't match up to all of the hype. I was hoping for more
5,This is near Pefection,"From the first time I saw this movie, I've been comparing it to Taxi Driver, which I thought was one of the Darkest Films I've seen, but Big Fan is Darker, because I believe there are more Pauls than Travis's in the World around us, people who are wound up so tight due to the way their lives have turned out that they resort to drastic measures. The key to a good Psychotic Study such as this is the belief it could happen (I know about the comparison of Travis and John Hinckley and Jodie Foster) The other thing I enjoyed was the brilliant permormance by the entire Cast, Patton Oswalt should have won an Oscar for this Performance, The woman who played his Mother did not Utter one false word in her entire performance, and the rest of the cast was equally impressive, including Paul's Sister-in-Law with the distracting Boob-Job (they were perfect for the part)"
3,Interesting,"I never even knew this movie existed until I heard Patton on a radio show. Though it is low budget and suffers a bit from slow pacing, this is a really interesting look at an obsessed, pathological Giants fan. Patton is actually quite good as the loser. I'm not quite sure what they were going for with the movie, I just found myself angry at Patton. I think this is certainly worth a rental."
3,"Romantic and Suspensful, but predictable","I am a big fan of Sharon Sala's and have read all of her books, including her others written under Dinah McCall. ""Remember Me"" was very romantic and the characters were well developed, but it lacked in suspense. There was only one way the book could have possibly ended, which made it predictable. I enjoyed the book, but I don't think it was one of her better ones."
3,Easy read; so so.......,Pretty good story. Sort of hard to believe circumstances involving a 2 year abduction. At least I did finish this one. Not the best but not the worst either. Sorry I cannot tell you it's a keeper. Happy reading.
5,A real page turner! Highly recommend it!,"I picked up this book just to have something to do for about 5 min. 5 hours later, I was done with it. I wasn't able to put it down! I don't remember any other book that had me so involved. After the wife disappeared, I wanted to see if she would come back. Then I wanted to find out what had happened and if she would get her memory back. I could tell you more why I liked it, but I might accidentaly give away too much of the book. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, especially someone that enjoys suspense stories!"
2,NOT A KEEPER!,"""Wonderful book""? ""Gripping""? Did we read the same book? I have to agree with ""one word: DISAPPOINTING."" I'll give Sharon Sala one extra star though. It was a predictable story and the characters were not fleshed out. It was hard to care for either them or their problems. Of course you can figure out the whole plot almost immediately. Even so, I've read books where that was the case and still enjoyed them. I did manage to finish it which is more than I can say for some of the one and two star books I've read (or attempted to read). Not a keeper. Cannot recommend it. Try LONE RIDER by LAUREN BACH. Much better!"
1,Worked for less than a day!,"I opened this, downloaded a few files, listened for 45 minutes and then nothing. What a waste. Not worth it at any price."
1,Stupid button,The first time I pressed the silver button it got stuck. So I sent the MP3 player back to Nextar and they mailed me another one. The button on THAT one got stuck within a week. STUPID! Grrr.
3,MP3 Malfunction,I order 2 of these Mp3 players for my girls for x-mas and one of them just quit working. Actually I should say it works when it wants to. So I have to rate it with a 3 because the other one works great and they are so easy to use.
2,For only the diehards,"This is very early NFG. The CD sounds underproduced, cheeply made, like it was recorded in their garage. Fans of NFG's latest CDs (self-titled, Sticks and Stones, etc.) may be dissapointed by the sound. Much more punk than their newer (and I think, more developed) sound. All the instruments are well-played (I especially liked Cyrus's drumming), it's just Jordan's whiny voice rising above the mess, more often then not out of key, which ruins this one for me. Only the diehard and hardcore fans of NFG (or those that really like their punk sound) will appreciate and like this CD."
3,good if u havent heard the others,"this album is pretty good but not new found glory at there best, as its 1 of there 1st albums then no-one would expect it to be there best work. this is pretty good for a debut album. if youve heard catalyst,new found glory and sticks and stones then you most probably wont be pleased with this album. but you can still tell its new found glory and there are a few classic nfg tracks on here. 6/10"
3,Now comming to you live from NFG's garage..............,"whoa! that's all I can say. This is raw, very early NFG. This is not only completely different than their self titled cd, but it's also completely different from Nothing Gold Can Stay. Like Blink 182's Buddha, NFG's It's All About the Girls is raw, and with a very different sound. Jordan's voice on this cd sounds unbelievebly high and whinny. You can tell it's him, but it's just so strange. Especially when compared to any other of their cds. The guitar, bass and drums are still very NFG though. Each of the 5 songs are pretty good, and worth hearing especially if you are a big fan of NFG. This is overall a pretty good cd. However, if you only like NFG's self titled, and didn't care for Nothing Gold Can Stay, then I wouldn't check this out. However, if you are the opposite of that, then this is a must to check out."
5,Excellent replacement battery!!!,"When my verizon contract ended, i upgraded phones but decided to keep the phone b/c i really liked the alarm clock feature. I've been using the phone solely as an alarm clock for about 4 years now. very portable and easy to use.However, the battery started to die which caused major problems b/c if i didn't wake up immediately (e.g. hit snooze), the battery would end up dying and the alarm not go off again causing me to be late. arrrgghhh!!!I actually thought i was going to have to ditch the phone b/c i didn't think anyone would have a replacement battery. Lucky me though. Found this battery and it's been working like a champ for about a year. Doesn't seem to have lost it's potency one bit. i can go 5 or 6 days without having to recharge.highly recommended for the motorola v325 phone (for anyone who actually still has one)."
1,Beware the time stamp,"EDIT: I purchased this from CCM Accessories. But the time stamp question is probably a good one for all retailers.Purchased the first of these on 11/12/10 for a trusty v325i. I was chagrined to find the time stamp said 12/07, so the battery was nearly three years old, and unlikely to fully charge. I called them about this and was convinced to try a ""3 cycle"" charge of 8 hour increments. The battery never had more than 70 minutes talk time, so I asked to swap...was told they had a newer lot in, from 2009. Did the exchange, and the next battery had a time stamp of 12/07.At least their returns department is prompt.If you want to call before ordering and find the age of the lot, that's your best bet. Otherwise forget it."
5,A Great 80s Spanish Rock Album,"Alaska Y Dinarama, the second or third incarnation of a Spanish punk/pop/rock band fronted by Olvido Gara, created a truly memorable, rockable and, yes, DANCEABLE album when they recorded Fan Fatal. Using some cutting edge (for the time) samples from pop songs and movies, they made memorable punk songs, with a strong pop sensibility. From the dancehall fun of La Mosca Muerta to the techno/trance El Diablo Anda Suelto to the Sex Pistols-influenced La Ciencia Avanza to the cheeky Vampirella (which perfectly displays Gara's love of cheesy horror), this is a truly eclectic and fun album. Highly recommended."
3,"Works well, not exceptional.","It works and does what it says. Not exceptional, but it gets the job done and does so at a very reasonable price.I would recommend it to another, yes, but don't expect some miracle lens. The Opteka does what it says and nothing more, but nothing less either. The handy adapter ring allows it to fit the old Handycam that I bought it for (A PC120), and without said ring it will fit newer models as well (even some not listed in the title such as theSony HDR-SR11 10.2-MP 60GB High Definition Hard Drive Handycam Camcorder with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom)"
4,Great deal for the price!,"The lenses can be purchased for the same price sepeartely but that would just be foolish! You definitely get more than you bargained for with this...The wide angle lense is, well, wide angle. Nothing spectacular and it does cause the picture to be a little more grainy in some instances...but great for the price!The telephoto lense only marginally improves zoom range on my SR-45. The picture quality is obviously better at full zoom than without the lense.The lense adapter...notorious for getting stuck in its threads on the camera...but does that really matter? Why remove it honestly...after all, you're buying lenses you surely intend to use at some point.The faux leather pouches are nice, the cleaning and protection supplies, and the LCD screen protector (handy on a touchscreen..and in high light situations) are a great bonus! And the tripod is simply wonderful for someone on the go!"
4,Great Popcorn,"The Whirley makes great popcorn. Use peanut oil (personal favorite), medium heat, and crank slowly and you're have great popcorn in about 3-minutes. On the negative side, while the aluminum pan is sturdy enough the lid and cranking mechanism is fragile. If you let your teenagers use this popper I don't think it will last long. However, if you're careful with it one should get several years service out of the popper. The box states it's guaranteed for 25-years; that is very much a stretch given the nylon crank gear and the very thin gauge aluminnum top. Just handle with care and I don't think you will be disappointed."
1,Poorly Packaged for Shipping - Broken Upon Arrival,"I was extremely disappointed upon receiving the Whirley-Popper. The design is flimsey and it was shoved in a box with no protection for shipping. By the time UPS had their way with it, it was bent to where the crank just fanned air.I was also disappointed to see that the gears were plastic (not acceptable for heat).They have a wonderful product that needs some manufacturing changes (metal gears) and improved packaging for shipping.I sent mine back for a refund."
1,Gotten A Whole Lot Cheaper,"This is our second Whirly Pop PopCorn Popper. It won't be our last, but this one certainly won't last. We had our first popper for about 10 years. It finally just wore out. But it was heavy duty. When this one arrived we could tell right off it was so cheap becaue it was so light. The crank handle to stir the popcorn is so flimsy the gearing pops. Right now we are on the lookout to find an older one at the Goodwill or Salvation Army Thrift stores because one is so bad."
3,not as simple as it seems,"You can set a color orYou can set the colors to change in sequence BUTevery time you turn off the light, it reverts to the color blue, so, if you want green, it has to be reset to your choice every time you turn it back on. Big deal?Yes, if you planned on putting it inside a ceiling fixture that has to be removed everytime you want to use a different color, or as an outside light, which would be enclosed, so you have to take the cover off to reset to your color choice. Get the idea?The only solution is to leave the light on all the time, lovely energy waster.To use it conveniently, easy color changes, it has to be in a lamp where the bulb is bare and easily accessible."
2,"Good Idea, lame product","It changes colors fine, and the colors look great, but it is very dim. Even if it's the only light in the room, you can only see the color/ light if you look directly at the bulb. I would recommend spending another $10 or so on the 36-LED bulbs."
1,What Changes....,This bulb stays lit in light blue. Does not change. Very disappointing. Dont waste your time
3,The photo quality.,"The historical work is right up to par. There are things in this book that I was not aware of, and that was a real treat.However. The reproduction of the photos in the book are really of poor quality. In some cases, to the point of being ridiculous. Old period photos and recent ones. Both are very poor in quality. I am no printing expert, but I would say that the paper is fine for printing text but of too poor a quality for pictures.The problem does not fall on the originals. I am familiar with them all.There should be a reprinting of the book. Even though I have purchased one already, I would purchase another that was printed on a quality parer.If you don't care about the pictures, no problem. It's a piece great work."
3,Not the best book about the Shakers,"I would not classify myself as a Shaker scholar, however, I have read a variety of works about the people of today and those of yesterday. I don't think Skees' descriptions of the Shakers of today are completely accurate. I would caution folks to see that this book was more about how Shakerism might fit into her own life, almost a comparison. I didn't see this as a picture of the spirituality of the Shakers as much as it is the spirituality of Suzanne Skees."
2,Strange beard,The beard was strange. The moustache was lopsided and the beard was sparse. The wig was pretty good
5,The real Santa would be proud!,"The Santa torch has been passed to our oldest son...who now surprises his kids on Christmas eve. This beard set is great...covers well, easy to put on...and looks genuine. Good value for the price."
2,Poor workmanship.,"This is a rating for the ""Santa Beard & Wig Set"". ( This does ""NOT"" rate the seller, which is 5 Stars. They did every thing that could be expected. It was My descision not to send it back and just buy another one. ) The beard set was flawed where the mustache was joined above lip's, It crossed over and tucked under causing a large lump and a part in the hair. My old wig set that was the same, from the same seller and I love it. I will be shopping with this seller again soon."
2,Beard ok other not so much,The wit was fine but the mustache. Could only be used once and the eye brows were to confusing to put on.
3,Not bad,Not bad but no Hall or Hiaasen seemed like the ending came fast leaving you empty guess I have to read another one
3,Quick read,This book ia a very quick read and I especialy liked the brief inclusions of some of Carl Hiaasen's characters from his novels set in Florida.
3,"Fun, but no Dorsey","The review by Scott in TX is right on. This book was a lot of fun, but don't expect the quality of characters that you get with Dorsey or Hiaasen."
3,Catch the allusion,Tips of hat abound. Spot the homage to the famous writers. Little plot. Ultimately no reason to go to the next story.
3,A fun read,"This was a fun read. It could easily be finished in an afternoon or two on the beach.However, I don't think Christopher Moore, Jimmy Buffett, or Carl Hiassen or, for that matter, Tim Dorsey needs to feel particulary threatened, as Mr. Andlu suggests, who has reviews for all of Tacoma's books and has given all five stars. One has to wonder if Mr. Andlu was writing reviews simply to promote Tacoma's books.Buy it, enjoy it. But, don't expect the depth of plot or character development you would get with Carl Hiassen or Tim Dorsey.I will probably buy more of Tacoma's series. But, given that they are trade paperbacks and relatively expensive new, I will probably wait until they are available for little cost as used books and reserve my new-book budget for Hiassen and Dorsey."
4,Pretty wierd,I enjoyed this book and would read another by this author. It was a good way to spend a day in the keys and the characters were engaging. A little convoluted but not so much that you have to re-read to catch up. If you like Carl Hiassen you might enjoy this book.
2,Getting old,"Fun, but weak. Tacoma is getting a little old. His characters are no longer fresh and the plots are samo-samo. If you have not read him in the past, give it a shot. If you have read a couple,give this one a pass."
3,"An okay book, but not stellar and not from a polished author","This book has a fairly straight-forward plot and cardboard characters, which is sad since the general story line could make for a great book. The author is not a threat to any established authors in the genre, there is no real character development and no plot twists or development of the storyline. In many cases, the characters are just not believable and the reader never really develops a relationship with any of them. This is the first work I've read from this author and I'm not inclined to read more.I bought the book on Kindle because of the ratings and I'm really thinking that it's possible they have been padded by the author or friends of the author, as others have suggested. It's not outright bad, but it's not the best writing you'll find."
2,Not for me,"I am a Keys person, spend a lot of time there, mostly middle keys, and read a lot from White thru Corcoran and even some of the off beat typesbut I just do not revel in the Dorsey style of humor. Maybe Hiassen is as far as I go and he gets a bit out of it at times. For my taste , this book is in the silly range. Hey, if you like the class clown stuff , go for it. But be forewarned - Pogo was a much funnier opossum."
2,?,"This is the first time I've wrote a review, but I was so dissatisfied with this book! I almost put it aside several times, but decided to persevere. Some of the reviews I read before purchasing compared the writer to Carl Hiassen and Randy Wayne White. However, I find that totally inaccurate, no comparison at all. This author wrote in an immature manner and was almost too boring to continue reading at points. I will say, this is the first book I have read from this author and I hope this just wasn't his best effort. I will read another of his works and go from there!"
