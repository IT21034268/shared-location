4,Johnny's the Man!,"This is a good starting anthology of JGW. My only regret is that ""The Real Deal"" is inexplicably missing from it. That is a scat MASTERPIECE. Another thing the above viewer pointed out, is JGW's use of humor in his compositions. I mean, I just CRY when I hear Johnny vamp at the end of ""Real Mother For Ya"": ""Gimme some of that low lead, I ain't gonna fool with nuthin' else! I gotta STOP buying TWO hot dogs and a strawberry soda!"" I ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOLL! Every time. I LOVE this man, miss him. I discovered him too late to see him in concert, and that is my greatest regret of all. I play him almost every day. I smile when I hear his voice, his licks, his ""Listen""'s between verses. This man IS a giant...right up there...with ANYONE you'd care to name. Johnny ""Guitar""? YOU ARE THE FREAKIN' MAAAAAAAAAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Pop it in and top it off,"If you missed the 70's and want to get a good taste of it, then buy this CD. This music is continually inventive, although some of it could be written off as disco crossover. The irrepressible spirit of 'Guitar' Watson shines through though, making this a very good listen. Check out Frank Zappa's ""One Size Fits All"" CD for more JGW fun and games."
5,excellent,"In an interview during the eighties Eric Clapton was asked whether he could name ""his favourite guitar player"". Johnny Guitar Watson was his answer. Nuff said..."
5,tighter than tight,"Please if anyone has not heard this album you are missing out on alot. what i'm trying to say is that you need to go get it you will be bouncing like crazy.peace, holla"
3,"Well written, but...","As a former professional player, I was a bit disappointed with the book. While the author wrote well and provided the reader with interesting life lessons, the tennis content left much to be desired. Since the book claims to be geared towards the high-level player, I expected some insight beyond the bits of information that the tennis academies have been preeching for years. I agree with one of the other reviews in that the book is a treatise on life... but unfortunately, it is not a treatise on high-level tennis."
5,Good plays!,"These plays written by Adrienne Kennedy are truly interesting to read. I am currently directing one of them, called ""She Talks To Beethoven."" Its a very compelling story and shows the contrasts between 1961 Ghana and old-time Berlin. These plays are very dramatic and I encourage anyone, whoever is interested in direting a one-act play, or just to read, to purchase this book."
5,"A Good Read and Excellent Intro to ""Machia's"" Life","Every now and then you read a book that brings its subject to life. Having studied Machiavelli from his writings, it helps to now know of his charms. This book contributed to my understanding of his works but more importantly to the background and history of his conversations. A good, quick read... Recommended."
5,Niccolo's Reality,"Quite good. Yeah, some people complain about it being boring, but I don't find it so. We're looking at somebody over 400 years ago. maybe things were boring then - This is a look at somebody who KNEW what was up in the world. Applies to present day times quite well. Machiavelli figured it out years ago. Well worth reading. If only our present day politicians could grasp it as well . . . ."
5,Another gem &#65533; what a fantastic book!,"This is Pete Welling's best book yet. Although I didn't think he could top Andrew McGroundhog and His Shady Shadow, I think Michael Le Souffl√©'s illustrations are the best of any children's book I have seen in recent memory.The story, a comical tale about a happy-go-lucky rooster and an irritable pig, is original to say the least. While I think children (and adults) will enjoy the story, it's the illustrations that steal the show. I was laughing more at the illustrations than at the story. Each page is packed full of humor within humor; the book may be a short 32 pages but it took me half an hour to get through it because I spent so much time on each page looking at the complex, yet fanciful, drawings.If you have a young child just learning to read or an older child who still enjoys being read to while looking at great illustrations, then buy this book. It will be cherished for years to come."
5,An Unknown Hero,"I have been very lucky now to purchase this album from amazon.com and now own 2 of Jimmy's cds. This guy has such talent and is very special indeed, the reason being Jimmy has undergo so many operations, than some of you have had dinners, and the courage and musical ability shines through in his music. This album is his 3rd and he specializes in Warm pop rock music, in the line of Bryan Adams. The songs are very thoughtfully written lyrically, and the sound quality and all instruments played brilliant throughtout. I love songs like Fresh and Blood and Same Old Look. You can check out Jimmy's style of music on MP3.com before you buy this album. He really deserves success."
2,Poor quality instructions and defective controls,"After wrestling this thing out of the box and laying all of the bagged/loose parts on the bedroom floor, I began the installation of the HWF05XC3. First off, the directions are vague on what actually secures this thing to the window. Secondly, you have to be a little creative on you hang this on the windows, because the pictures are often unclear as which direction a hasp or other part should be facing. Thirdly, after finally installing this on my window, I plug it in and turned the knob to ""On."" Guess what? The knob broke! This could be part of a bad batch and maybe the rest of them don't have defective knobs, but the poorly written instructions offer no excuse. The only saving grace (it's a ""2"" instead of a ""1"") was the helpful customer service. I only wish I could've e-mailed my request for assistance instead of having to fax New York City."
5,GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE,I HAVE ENJOYED THE SERVICE THAT HAVE GOTTEN.YOU ARE RIGHT ON TIME AND YOU DO RIGHT BY YOUR PRODUCTS.THANX AGAIN I WILL ALWAYS BE A CUSTOMER
3,Review of History of Prussia,"Book was in good condition. But, did not get a cover for the book, therefore Bland without a cover. Purchasing Photo showed a book with a cover. Interesting book."
3,Disco Stu,"Disco Stu is a solid sculpt, although for the figure that most people were most anticipating, I think he's one of my lesser favorites of the wave. Don't get me wrong - he's good. It's just that with only his one arm in his disco pose, and his legs forced to be straight for the voice chip, he doesn't look like the wild and crazy Disco Stu you'd expect."
4,Overall a great bag,"What a great bag! I have a few quibbles; as noted, the inside pockets are a bit tight. The zipper tab doesn't seem to match the heft of the zipper. The exterior pocket flaps should be a bit wider/broader to cover the pocket and the gatemouth design seems to balk if you stuff the bag. All minor. Well constructed overall and every bit worth the price. A reasonably lightweight bag that holds a decent amount - of course, you'll cram more into it than you can comfortably carry. Because it's a medium/long bag you have to balance the load - otherwise it dips - and why no shoulder pad? I personally wouldn't recommend the recip saw w/blade in the bag. I once tripped and landed on a nylon bag w/ a jigsaw - blade in thigh - ouch! No more. Blades off all saws (except circular) and hard cased for transport. I like this bag a lot."
4,This sucker is NICE,"I bought this to replace one that got stolen on new year's day. Can't live without it. I had to have another.Could it be better? Yes, but that could be said of just about anything. However, I can get all my brushes into this, my 2-4 pole, caulk gun, masker, knee-pads, nails, hammer, punch, mask, extra cartridges, a full sleeve of tape, four screwdrivers, scrapers, and STILL have room.IMHO this is the best toolbag for painters on the market. The only thing I can't get into this bag is cut-pots and a 5 gal. bucket with grid and frame. But hey, if it were that big, I wouldn't be able to lift it.All in all, I'm very glad I bought this tool bag."
4,I use this for mobile car repair,Havent been using it long but seems reasonably durable and I have some heavy stuff in there. I especially like the straps on the outside of the bag for my long crowbar and breaker bar. I would have liked some extra zippered interior pockets but a couple tool roll ups thrown in there solves the issue for me. Also if you use the shoulder strap and the bag is heavy like mine is it may be uncomfortable. What I did here is put an aftermarket car seatbelt pad on there and all is well.
2,not in Connelly's league,"one gets the sense that the author analysed a bunch of best selling mysteries, and then dashed off one of his own. which he could have pulled off fine if he came across as someone who had actual experience, first hand or close to it, with the material. instead it feels like like he went straight from a university writing program to writing about lives he never came closer to than reading other novelists describe.his details about guns are play army gear geek detail, not something most ex military special ops types would obsess about.lastly, he's always using BRAND NAMES, often multiple times on one page. i assume he's doing it for artistic effect of some kind, not for payola, but if i wanted to get bombarded w brand names i'd watch tv."
3,This is not a bad book,"... This is not a ""sensational"" thriller - but it is awfully good.I am more intrigued as to who ""Michael Crow"" is, - he obviously knows the craft of writing and I wish there was I way I could find out who he is...nonetheless, if this is his first effort into this genre, then I say, ""Michael, job well done"".The plot is simple enough - but I do agree with the other reviewer - how could Vassily not know Luther was a cop? At the end of the day, the relationship between Vassily and Luther is what will keep you going, and all the gun play is mighty entertaining...I found the end to come quickly, and thought that could've been deveoped more...also, I was hoping they would explore more about the little girl found in the woods that opened the book.Either way, Mr. Crow leaves the door WIDE open for many more sequels. It is a very entertaining read - great for a coast-to-coast flight.If you tell us who you are Mr. Crow, I will support your other books. Cheers !"
3,"NOT DIBDIN, BUT NOT BAD","The author (Vollman??) knows his guns, the technical side is accurate. Lots of bodies, as well as loose ends. Lots of shooting, perhaps a bit much lingering over Luther's mental state and ""anomie"". Not as well written as Lee Child's Reacher series, which has pretty much pooped out. Even M. Dibdin seems to be going thru the motions with the resurrected Aurelio Zen.So----it was a fast read, and enough sex and family weirdnessto hold one's attention. But there's an awful lot of very cliche black/white stuff, the dialog between ""DOG"" and Luther is particularly lame, and the cop-buddy stuff is also tired. And poppa ""Gunny"" is a joke. You just KNOW the sidekick is going to...well, I won't give it away. Worth reading though. A solid ""B-"". Just don't expect too much logic and a tight plot. Above average thriller. As for hubris---too much ""MAMMY"" from the opera singer...."
4,Ultimate Fabulosity,"This disc is a must if you are seeking to own the ultimate dance collection ,, the first couple mixes are pretty much a take from Madonna's material girl,,,, If you are looking for the single that has the *buy the fu**ing record* lyrics , this is not the right one. try the import"
5,Is life better?,"YES!This is a really uplifting, fun hit from Tamperer. The lyrics are a bit silly but you can't resist being carried away by the whole thing!It's really cathcy and you'll be singing it for days."
4,DANCE!,"Makes ya wanna DANCE! Great beat...courtesy of ""Material Girl"" sample....the 1st Madonna song to be sampled! Best versions use this sample...the Thunderpuss versions are good but not as strong and driving as the ""Material Girl"" sampled version. The ""extended mix"" is not 7.58 minutes long as indicated on the disk however. It is about 4.30 minutes long. All around winner...deserves radio play in the US...c'mon dj's what are you waiting for???????"
4,FUN FUN FUN!,"Ya forget your troubles with this one! A fun fun song...silly lyrics..but a great beat courtesy of a sample of Madonna's ""Material Girl""....very innovative! Mya has a fun voice! U go girl!"
4,unique and sturdy,"This has stood up well to constant use in our restaurant, and customers have asked where we got it. It should give years of service, and does not look tired as wooden models do after awhile."
4,the Slayers [dvd collection],this is the frist season in a new box and title!! I allready have the first season in the thin pack and did not really need a second copy
4,Two stories in one...,"26 episodes of fantasy. I'm not really into fantasy, I prefer sci-fi and noir, but so many people said I should try out The Slayers that I felt I should trust them and watch the first collection.While the artwork seemed a tad old the story lines, the acting, the humor really helped keep my interest. There are two major story arches and tons of stand-alone episodes which still help push the series forward. The humor is a mixture of adult and slapstick so almost everybody is going to find something funny. Also, I think AD&D; players might enjoy the characters and how they interact, like how Lina and Gourry treat each other.Get it used unless you are a real fan of fantasy anime."
3,Great... except for the Sound Issues,"Boy did SS/CPM drop the ball!! They inverted the soundfield for the Japanese audio. Beyond that, this is a long-awaited compilation of the most hysterical cross of D&D and anime to come along in a long time!"
2,"Excellent show, but with a massive audio bug","Slayers is a lot of fun if you like crazy, over-the-top comedy in a fantasy setting.Some people complain that it's stupid, which is certainly true, but it gets a lot of humour from its slapstick stupidity. Think of Slayers as something along the lines of the Three Stooges meet Lord of the Rings.However, CPM messed up massively on the Japanese audio. One track is phase-inverted. On a mono setup, you get basically no audio. Stereo systems sound ""funny,"" lacking highs and lows and pretty much any sense of direction (in addition to being very quiet). ProLogic receivers will throw everything to the back speakers. This is the same set of problems that showed up with Rurouni Kenshin disc 1, except that, unlike Media Blasters, CPM is calling this a ""non-issue"" and not offering any fixes."
1,A SERIOUS defect in these discs!,A defect in the Japanese language track has resulted in phase-inverted audio. On pro-logic and 5.1 systems this will result in a spacey sound with extremely low volumes making it nearly impossible to hear what is being said.Central Park Media in their official press release has decided to leave this defect in place making no effort to correct this obvious flaw in their product.Consider this before you spend the $100 on this set.
5,This was one of the best decisions I have ever made....,"I never actually ""encountered"" the japanese track defect. If any, I think that a very small minority of people are actually affected. Thus, there are no risks taken. I recommend this for everyone. I do not think that there are any real chances being taken when buying this."
2,No Naga The Serpent; Story is Bland.,"I love the new Slayers. Naga The Serpent, genuine demons, all sorts of great DVD movies out there. But honestly, this isn't the best of Slayers by any means. I watched them all of once over the past three years. Tenchi I've watched a dozen times, Cowboy Bebop a good 20 times and the rest of my anime are always in my DVD player. This one? Not so much. I advise against it.It's not funny and it's a chore to watch, but at least the animation is of the same quality."
1,I don't get it.,"It's just not funny. That's all I have to say about it. The series TRIES to be funny and fails miserably. It's japanese cartoon slapstick at it's worst, the whole things' humor revolves around facial distortion and being loud and rude. Kids and die-hard otakus will like it but between you and me, it's worse than Pokemon. At least I liked that AT ONE TIME."
4,The Slayers is one great anime series,"The Slayers is a great anime series. Its packed with Action, Comedy, and tons of slapstick humor! There are some scenes that will make you laugh and some even that will make you shed tears. Overall this DVD collection is one that you definetly want if your an anime fan! I give it 4 stars becuase it has a slight audio bug. The japanese soundtrack is in mono not sterio."
1,Good Series Plagued By Audio Problems,"This is an excellent series that suffers because of a major defect in the DVDs that the manufacturer (Central Park Media) now says they refuse to fix. Not only that, but they continue to sell them as if nothing is wrong. There is also about a minute of footage that was inadvertently cut from the end of the last episode. Please avoid this set for now until a fixed version is made. For those looking to get their Slayers fix, check out the ""Book of Spells"" and ""The Motion Picture"" DVDs. These are both very funny and require no previous knowledge of the series to enjoy."
5,The Slayers has done it again.,"I was so happy to finally recive my 4 cd's set, I immidietly started wathing it, what caused me to finish the whole thing in 4 days. The Slayers are definetly diffrent- I got addicted at the first moment, can't let anything slip away. The animetion is absolutley wonderful, and the character design is beautiful. Lina's really making her title, ""Dragon Spooker"", worth it's while. It was an absolute delight, and I'm definetly going to buy the next seasons, as soon as I can. This is one of the most great animes I had seen so far, and trust me, I had seen *alot*."
2,Item arrived on time but the disc isn't able to be written on.,"The item arrived before the scheduled delivery date, but I put in the disc to backup my hard drive but I wasn't able to get my computer to write on the disc. The seller sent the product promptly and courteously so I'm thinking it could be a defective product, but you can't be to sure anymore."
4,"so funny, a great gift for a school superintendent!","i gave this to my uncle who is a school superintendent, and although he is not a big simpsons fan, he thought it was hilarious. i gave it along with the school cafeteria environment so that it would talk and it was great. it says a lot of good phrases. skinneerrrr!!!!"
4,Mercury Monarch,"My first car was a Mercury Monarch that I bought for $1000 in Grinnell, Iowa. That car was a gas-guzzling monster that became uncontrollable during every Iowa winter. But it was my first car, and it defined me in certain ways.This book is a bit like that car for me. Consumes a lot of pages and gets unwieldy at times. But it captures truth. Truth about being an immigrant and about being an immigrant's son. About being Indian and American.Don't read this expecting a masterpiece. And you'll probably turn the last page being glad that you read it."
3,Be Patient,"The beginning of this book creates a lot of questions that one waits to have answered. Be patient, they are all answered eventually. However, I think his weaving is not refined enough. I like that he weaves the three different generational experiences but I think they could be intergrated more expertly."
1,Cliched and pedestrian,"Parekh's cliched and prosaic style will surely make for a good bedtime book. I picked this up hoping for fresh new South Asian American voice. Instead I found a trite ethnography written with little imagination and even less skill. Parekh should stick with medicine for the stories he shares are the kinds that every south asian american has experienced, but when presented in a hackneyed amateur voice such as Parekhs' they become the mundane and pedestrian stuff of 99 cent bins."
5,"A captivating, enriching, highly recommended read","Stealing The Ambassador by Sameer Parekh is an astutely written novel of family, clashing beliefs, and the eternal yearning for a happy and prosperous future. Rajiv Kothari is a young man whose father believes that success and freedom can only be truly enjoyed in America, while his grandfather believes in such ideals for their native India. The dynamic tension and interplay between generations is a crucial focus point in this captivating, enriching, highly recommended read."
5,"Dense, incisive exciting first novel...","I can't say enough how much this book impressed me. It is the one of the most accurate and chilling insights into the mind of an adolescent that has been written in the last 15 years. Asher himself bears comparison with the icy protagonist of Amis' Rachel Papers, but where the Rachel Papers stops at being an entertaining insight into callow youth, Mark Fyfe's debut is underpinned with a distubingly thourough debunking of the falacies of modern sociology and culture. A deeply significant concept, superbly made flesh and elegantly handled."
5,Let's talk increased productivity.,"When I'm on a job, I can need 15 different types of nails and screws-easy. I used to keep them in the lumberyard bags stashed in a 5 gallon bucket. Now let see where is that bag with the 3d finish nails? I know it's in here somewhere. Right, usually the last bag I'd look in. I bought two sets of the stackers-one for screws and one for nails, and those unproductive search minutes have become a thing of the past. My only complaint is sometimes a lower stackers will come out with the upper one and then fall off, spilling its contents. Aw, quit your belly achin'."
5,Gift,I purchased this as a gift for my husband. This works as it states and is very handy for organizing little stuff in his shop.
5,bucket boss organizer,"these are great for small ietms like nuts , bolts screws and nails. i have them on my work truck and love them. they are hard to find at home stores, so amazaon is the place to go. buy the 4-pak , save some money ."
2,Lots more money for nothing.............,"This program is useless. I wanted to upgrade from MS Publisher as I edit a 16 page newsletter. I can see no difference between Printshop Publisher and the $30 reg. printshop programs. At least nothing that I would use on a regular basis. Besides the money difference, I am having a problem with fonts changing. It seems when you want to open a legal document which you have spent hours creating, you can't open without first changing the printer settings. If you do, it defaults to letter size and changes all of your fonts to smaller sizes. When you have worked for hours on a design, you don't want to have to go back in to correct all of these changes. I have written several times to the company and gotten no response, so evidentally their customer service is as useless as their product. I have used Printshop at home for at least 6 years and upgraded annually, but am very sorry that I recommended it to my company. I feel responsible for their needless purchase."
2,Broderbund Print Shop 21 Pro Publisher Deluxe,This was alot of money for what this program offered.Many other print shop programs can do many of the things that this program can do but for alot less money. Not happy with this program at all!!!!
1,Don't invest in this program,The need to keep putting in the CD for art is crazy. The support is horrible. Just move on past this one....
1,Terrible Tech Service,"I bought the Print Shop Deluxe 21 and also many other Broderbund products over the last 6 months and have several problems that needed tech support, they have little or no support for the products they sell, so my only option has been to return them. Apparently they don't care about their customers."
5,Truly spectacular,"Although the first book in this trilogy was my favorite, that doesn't knock this book out of the running for awesome read. I really enjoyed every bit of this book. I thought it was so cute and sweet( and okay a little sappy)the way he called her ""kitten"" throughout the book. It showed he had affection for her from the beginning of their relationship. Of course anyone who lets you SHOOT you and not be the slightest bit angry with you must have some affection for you. I can't think of one thing that bothered me about this book and i wouldn't hesitate to say so if there was. It was fast paced and kept my attention from start to finish. I'm a little sad to be done with the Sterling family, but i thought it was a wonderful end to the trilogy."
1,Incra Jig Ultra,"I spent several hours assembling this tool.I have spent several hours attempting to make the double dovetail joint. The first attempts were failures. I installed more lighting to help and tried once more. Another failure. I can,t make the tails with ant accuracy. I am returning this tool and hope for a refund.Also purchased the frued router bits and are happy with them.Incra ULTRA16SYS 16-Inch Jig Ultra Woodworking System"
4,Could be user friendlier,I bought the personal firewall plus build 7.1.113 because I wanted to block the IP addresses of spammers. The problem is the entries do not list in numerical order. So I have to review my entire previous list for each entry I add to see if it's part of a range.McAfee Personal Firewall Plus 7.0
2,"Terrible, read review for details...","Some friends of mine told me about McAfee Personal Firewall Plus 2006 Version 7.0 and said how great it was and easy it is. Well, it sounded very good on the website and so forth, but when I got it installed on my PC, it was running fine. The protection it provides is great, don't get me wrong. But, when I tried visiting a website I had an error. And when I started browsing more and more using Microsoft Internet Explorer, I noticed a very slow ""browsing"" experience. Everything was very very slow at loading, sometimes IE would freeze, or not even load the website and say ""The page cannot be displayed"".The interface is ""pretty"", and the firewall is great, but because I ran into so many problems the first day I use and buy the product, I cannot recommend this program for anybody...Hope my review was helpful to you!"
5,The BEST Series,"Instead of getting weaker with each new release, the Naked Gun Series maintains his hilarious stance from the first to the last. This set is a winner in every sense."
5,The Naked Gun DVD Gift Set,"If you are a Leslie Nielson fan or know someone who is, this gift set is a must! Each video contains a fantastic cast who contributes to the crazy antics that take place throughout each movie. You won't be disappointed with this purchase."
5,it must be good,"i love the movies,but I know it must be good because even my dad loved it and he doesn't speak english."
5,"Three Slapstick Classics in one box, definite collectors","Naked gun, spoof classic and one of the funniest movies of all time, this is a collectors edition and will definitely keep you laughing, now with a special edition widescreen, this movie is a highly rated slapstick and i'm sure you'll love it except for the fact that O.J is in it. 9/10."
5,Hilarious,This is a great set for those who like zany comedies. The sequels also live up to the very high humor standard set in the first. Loads of laughs.
4,Entertaining if you like this type of comedy,These movies can make you laugh with minimal thinking on your part. I found no surprises when I received them - 3 full length movies on 3 DVD's. The sound and picture quality was good. I thought it was worth the $$.
2,"Hmmmm, scenes were missing....","This is not what I expected it to be. Its true that many scenes not appearing in TV broadcasts are shown, but then the extra scenes that the TV media puts in to stretch the show time are missing. Too bad. I'll give this away and buy each movie seperately."
4,"Good, but not as great as the TV show","As most Naked Gun fans know, the movies were a spin-off on the show Police Squad. The show, which only lasted 6 episodes was even more funny than the movies. Now I'm not saying the movies are bad. The movies are great, its just find it a shame that no rich tycoon in Holywood has the brains to release the funniest show to ever hit the air waves. Whoever owns the rights to the show would make a ton of money if they released it on DVD. Its a shame that [stuff] like Scarry Movie, American Pie, and all the other ""comedies"" now days is showed down our throats and real comedy is placed in a storehouse somewhere to rot.But back to the movies. Buy them and watch them and if you like to laugh. And if you really love them, try to find Police Squad.I shall leave you with some advice from Frank:""We would have come sooner but your husband wasn't dead then."""
2,"Long on pics, short on content","The pictures are very good if that's all you want. The history is minimal and primarily on Whiting-Davis bags. I was very disappointed in the content as there is no information on why some bags are valued higher, what to look for in purchasing antique bags, and how to identify the era. I guess I just expected more text than was given."
4,some name confusion???,"i'm somewhat confused as searches for ""Glenn Jones"" return a Gospel/R&B; singer - the Amazon link for ""Glenn Jones"" underneath the title of this album similarly links to this Glenn Jones but i have a very hard time believing that this is the same artist...can someone clear this up?love this album BTW - i've been a big fan of this Fahey school of music for some time and Jack Rose and co are doing an amazing job of adding to this rich uniquely American repertoire..."
5,The Grief of a Grand Parent,"Nina Bennett's book, Forgotten Tears, starts with her granddaughter Maddy's unexpected still birth. From this painful experience, she ultimately offers a sensitive and inclusive book on the subject of personal grief. She highlights a topic not often discussed: How grandparents' grief over the death of a grandchild is indeed sometimes forgotten, even though their grief is arduous.The author artfully shares her struggle with grief until a sense of renewal reigns. Bennett is passionate about giving her grief meaningfulness to herself as well as helping others find their path alng the grief journey.Included are individual stories, and suggestions to permit grief to forge character through redefining normal. Anyone experiencing loss of a loved one will benefit from this foundational book on grief. Excellent bibliography and resource section.Judy Martin-Urban, author of I Can't Remember Me, inspirational nonfiction LangMarc Publishers May 2006 www.judeurbanski.com"
4,"Looking Glass is more than just ""Brandy""","If you weren't lucky enough to be the few who actually bought Looking Glass's Albums back in the 70's, you should check them out and give them a chance now! I personally gave them a chance back in the 70's and fell in love with their style. They are unique in their sound. I especially love the song ""Jimmy Loves Mary-Anne""."
3,Searching for Brandy,"I love music and when I heard the song ""Brandy"" on the radio one day, I did some research to find the group that performed it. Looking Glass did not sound familiar to me, but I bought the CD and there are quite a few good songs on here. Elliot Lurie started the band and wanted to be a hard rocker, but the recording company was more interested in his ballads. I like both kinds of music, but his voice does purr on ""Brandy"". None of the other songs on the album are bad either. It is definitely worth the buy."
3,Heaven Scent,"This version of Heaven Scent is kind of weak. The scent is reminiscent of the old perfume, but not as pretty or potent. I like it and will use it, but I probably will not buy it again."
2,Not Big Enough,I purchased 3 extra big size flexfit caps for my son. Unfortunately they didn't fit. Have to return. They are XXL and he needs XXXL.
5,Every child should have this book,My father gave this book to me as a child. I am now reading it to my two daughters. Many of these stories are lost to younger children. I plan to give this book as a gift to those friends who appreciate true learning.
1,Simply NOT GOOD!,"I have had this juicer for about a year. I went to use it a couple days ago and the stainless spout is locked into place. I am a chef and cookbook writer and use all kinds of equipment, tools and appliances on my TV show. This is one I would never recommend. I am now on Amazon looking for another juicer. What a waste of money!"
4,A Good Buy,"I've tried cheaper citrus juicers, but I juice large quantities (64 oz or more), and they usually burn out on me. The CritriStar seems to be able to keep up with any amount I want to juice. The only downside is that the filter isn't adjustable and it lets through more of the tiny seeds than I'd like. Easy enough to scoop those out, but in a perfect world, I'd be able to adjust the filter setting."
5,Bam Dim Dim,It's a great live cd and dvd of the Mouser. When i heard the cd i see the mouse gone wild!
1,Windows Mobile 5 Incompatible,"You're better off spending the extra money to acquire a stand-alone GPS unit than wasting money on something that is completely incompatible with all Windows Mobile 5 devices. On top of that, the standalone software that comes with this device takes up so much room that I had to store it on an SD card, completely defeating the purpose of having an SDIO device. I love my TomTom, which I acquired refurbished after failing to have this run, and would recommend acquiring that instead of this device."
3,Do not even look at Amazon's picture,The picture shown is not this product. This product only comes with the receiver and a trial of the software. I can not tell you how well it works because I returned it unopen since I thought I was getting more for my money.
1,Toussaint - or sinners?,"It's hard to think who would be interested in this album. Not Cole Porter fans, not Allen Toussaint fans: these are cheesy instrumentals of Porter classics played by a gaggle of cheap Casiotone-like early children's keyboards. I can understand why Cole Porter's name is on the cover - they are his famous songs - but is there any real connection between this and Allen Toussaint, the great pianist, arranger, songwriter and producer? This isn't the blues, it's blue cheese."
5,It Never Rains In Southern California,"You may say who is Albert Hammond? This is truly an amazing listen. You can hear elements of the likes of Cat Stevens and The Guess Who. The first ten songs are from the original album, ""It Never Rains In Southern California,"" a master work in itself on par with the likes of ""Tea For The Tillerman."" It Never Rains In Southern California is a catchy tune that turned out to be a top 10 hit for Hammond, but actually one of the weakest songs on the album. ""From Great Britain To LA"" is a delicious song about stardom; ""If You Gotta Break Another Heart"" is a beautiful and meditative song we can all relate to; ""Down By The River"" and ""The Road To Understanding"" are anthem-like folk-rock tunes that you will enjoy. The greatest song is ""Names, Tags, Numbers, Labels,"" a song of both melodic and philosphic depth. In conclusion, this is a must-have for anyone who enjoys the folk-rock genre."
5,Does the job,"We give our Shelties these in an attempt to keep our grass green. So far, so good. Plus, we tried other brands, but they won't eat any of the other ones. So, this is our go-to brand."
3,music,"Dvd is of fair quality. the sound is not very good on our copy, but another may be excellent. If you like John Denver get it"
3,Great Show,"The sound is great, however portions of the video is grainy. Overall enjoyable in spite of the prior mentioned issue."
5,A must have for Denver fans,"This is one of those rare concert videos that has excellent sound and true to original arrangements. If you're a John Denver fan, you definitely want this dvd."
2,Could Have Been Much Better,"I bought this CD with the anticipation that Jessica was finally going to come out of Mariah's shadow and give us some better lyrics and stronger singing. However, ""Iresistible"" does not come close. I listened to the album from beginning to end, but I found the material very weak, especially the uptempo songs. She's very adept, I must say, at the ballads; I really like ""There You Were"" and ""His Eye is On the Sparrow."" And overall, the album just didn't give Jessica her own sound. The lyrics and music wasn't her style. I think it was a good effort, so I gave her two stars. But I really think she needs to think hard for her next album."
1,IRRESISTIBLE TO THROW IT DOWN THW GARBAGE!,"What A bad album!, BUY MANDY MOORE'S self titled one, its' way superior, this album only included the well produced ""Irresistible"", wich is great and close to classic, but the other tracks are pure fillers!. If there's only another worth saving track is ""Forever In Your Eyes"" that should have come the second single, not the dicusting ""A Little Bit"", ""Where Your Are"" duet with Marc Anthony is worth listen to it too, the other tracks sound like drop outs of ""Samantha Mumba"" or ""Geri Halliwell of the Spice Girls"" so wrong so bad, but after all I think the cover photo is ok!, like a ""Maxim or Cosmopolitan cover"""
1,Jessica Simpson There's Something Missing...,After watching Jessica Simpson on MTV I realized that she's as fragile as delicate china. She couldn't even mop her floor if it wasn't for her nanny. After listening to her album I realize that she couldn't write a hit song if it wasn't for a skilled producer and enhancements from today's latest studio trickery. On MTV she's kind of replaced the Osbournes as Americas favorite celebrity to laugh at. At least the Osbournes started out genuine and then became a parody of them selves. ON top of that we all know Ozzy has taken way too many drugs so he may not know any better. For Jessica she was pretty much hatched of the big time star making machine as a parody of herself.
1,where'd she go?,WHERE THE HELL IS SHE!! I FEEL BAD FOR THIS 1-HIT-WONDER....DO SOMETHING JESSICA...GOODNESS I HOPE HER MOVIE DOES WELL....SO AT LEAST SHE MAYBE SHE'LL ACTUALLY GET ANOTHER HIT!!
2,Look Britney has a new album- oh wait its...,"Jessica Simpson can sing alright but on that Star search-atch me sing happy birthday for an half an hour kind of way. I got the disc for free and that is what it should be free. The first single irresistable is simply awful and that new image of hers please how much peroxide went into her hair and who told the girl to start dancing? She does have the pipes like Christinia and Carey but they all have one thing in common not a drop of soul to thir voices it's said if one of these girls ever covered ""Natural Woman' they wouldn't understand the angst to pull it off and that's why songs such as ""For your love"" and ""To fall in love again"" lack spirit please this cookie sutter sound is trite and patheitic if Jessica just went and found new produces who can work around her limitaions she could turn out a solid material but for now this cd is a coaster for drinks!"
1,Jessica Simpson Is Not Irresistable,"Okay, does the world really need any more blonde chicks trying to prove they can sing? Britney & Christina are enough, and they're too much. Stop trying to be like the Debbie Gibson's & Tiffany's of the 80's. Jessica may have a nice voice, but none of her songs are worth listening to."
1,AWFUL!,"No matter what you do, DO NOT buy this item. I criticize it for being boring, unworthy of your money or time, and I highly demand to know why Jessica Simpson is making music. I bought this cd for Irresistable and found out that it was a waste. Think about it, you can't understand what she's saying, and further more who would want to? If you like good music, I reccomend N'sync and Britney Spears. just don't be fooled by Irresistable."
3,"Very talented, very beautiful. Mired in mediocrity.","This girl can sing like few people on the planet can. She has a range that rivals Mariah Carey's. In many of the (admittedly catchy) songs on this album it's hard to believe the throaty alto is coming out of the same pipes as the soaring soprano from the previous track.She has a body that would stop most male hearts instantly. She is truly - almost painfully - nice.The only problem with Jessica is her complete failure to dare to be different. And declaring your ignorance of food products on national TV doesn't count. Her slavish commitment to oversinging (especially live) has become a Mariah parody. If she would just FEEL a song instead of trying to do a dozen pitch changes on each and every note, Jessica could become a legend. Instead she's settling for being a punchline."
1,Sad..,"Although I'm a fan of Jessica's, this album was a complete disappointment. I was hoping that her sophomore release would be a bit more.. how should I put this?- ground-breaking. Honestly, Jessica CAN sing. The problem isn't her voice, though- it's the material she's being given/choosing to perform. Truthfully, the only reason why my copy of 'Irresistible' is still in one piece is because of the duet with Marc Anthony. Aside from that, and perhaps ""When You Told Me You Loved Me""- which actually IS a beautiful song- I have no reason to listen to this CD. The music itself makes it sound like Jessica- or her producers- are trying too hard. She's got potential, and certainly everyone was hoping for good things from this album, but it'll take a lot to redeem her career and reputation from this major let-down in sales, chart status, and promotion."
3,Talent in an unforgiving world,"Jessica's biggest burden and dispair must be her record label releasing her debut album AFTER Britney Spears, Christina, etc. It's natural for fans to make the comparisons and judgments even when it's compelety unfair.My 2 cents...Although the songwriting and production are the best that money can buy, the unfortuntly thing is that Jessica's talent takes a back seat on this album. This is entirely the labels undoing. I can assure you that Jessica has little say on what gets on the album. If there is to be any blame on this album, that would be the production and the managemenet company....but what's a girl to doHopefully the label will wisen up and let her talent shine through with better songwriting matched with intuitive production.She is young and time is on her side. Maybe someone will wisen up because Talent in an unforgiving world can be so cruel."
1,Oh my god she's so f-ing hot!,"That long blond hair, man, and did you see her in Dukes of Hazard! Oh my f-ing god, those hot pants, that @ss, damn. Whoa! She can drive my General Lee anytime;-) If only she'd keep her mouth shut."
5,Jessica Simpson At Her Absolute Best!,Jessica is one of the best singers on earth. She has a voice that could almost rival Mariah Carey's. She's talented. She's not from the Mickey Mouse Club brigade. Her songs are wonderful. She sings the lyrics in such a terrific way. She's just amazing. Period.
1,I THINK SHE CAN DO MUCH BETTER!!,"JESSICA SIMPSON IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL AND TALENTED GIRL BUT I THINK THE MATERIAL FOR MOST OF THE ALBUM WAS KIND OF BRITNEY TYPE SONGS.SHE SINGS GREAT BUT SHE CAN SING BETTER,ALOT OF THE SONGS ARENT FOR HER VOICE OR SHE DOESNT KNOW HOW TO USE IT THAT WELL I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED"
4,Very Impressive!,"Compared to her first album, Jessica Simpson has really matured and come into her own. Overall, the ballad tracks [except with Marc Anthony] leave something to be desired. Otherwise, a flawless album with stellar production. She really came with the beats this time and her voice matches the beats to a tee. Way to go girl! Get this album if you want to be pleasantly surprised by the uptempo hip-hoppish beats."
3,Pretty good!,When my sister got me this ablum I was thinking that it was going to suck but to my surprise I found it to be very good! I really like the songs on the ablum and the sound of her voice. I would totally reccomend this CD to anyone who listens to pop or soft rock and stuff. It's very good!
3,jessica simpson is irresistible,"People ....lets not be too judgemental . I mean jessy has come a long since her last album . She has a nice voice and a great reputation ..and her video clips are not immature and offensive . Still, She has a long way a head of her but i trust that she 'll make it in this business cause she is good . I haven't bought this album yet but i will .... If you like this type of music and you are crazy about mariah carey & Christina then you'll enjoy this album ."
4,Darker Shade of Pop,"In the rat-race of the summer Jessica Simpson gives Mandy Moore a good fight with her second LP entitled ""Irresistible"". Her new album dawns a more R&B feel with an equal amount of sappy love songs and upbeat inspirational tracks. Her new darker shade of pop seems to be working even though this new album is very much like her former cd."
5,"Excellent Album, I Must Admit","I can't stand Jessica Simpson but I love this album. The best song is ""What's It Gonna Be"". Jessica is slutty but she's a pretty good singer."
1,irresistably bad!,"Hey peeps! Jessica has an awesome voice, but has some suggestive lyrics in some of her songs. She claims to be a Christian, but w/what her songs say and how she acts and dresses, well...that's what Christians aren't supposed to do! I am a Christian and I do not look up to her as a role model @ all! We shouldn't be filling our minds w/boyfriend/grlfriend stuff now. Think be4 you act so that ur mind isn't filled w/trash! Try to be pure! Guard ur heart and stay away from evil!"
1,I thought she dead,"that one childish song and her only hit ""Irresistible"" was enough...so it was no wonder why her reality show flopped and was cancelled, like all her albums!"
2,??????????????,"When I first listened to this album I was very dissapointed. Although I think the title song is catchy (hence my 2 star rating instead of one). They just seem to be capitalizing on what is popular and therefore the songs don't really seem too creative. instead of this one, buy In This Skin.....its much better."
4,Pleasantly surprised by this album,"I was really surprised by this album. I didn't think I was gonna like it honestly. I liked the singles that were released plus a few of her other tracks. It's just a simple, feel good album, something to listen to in your car to work. I really like the fast tracks..the slow ones are cool too. I'm going to buy her new album today, we'll see how they measure up."
4,good album,"well i think that this album is good, with 12 tracks on the album you can hear different moods of pop songs, my favorite is #3 forever in your eyes, its a good track.... sadly jessica falls short on this album, only having 2 singles it just sold 603,000 which is ok i guess but it will be a miracle is we see her make another album anytime soon ...."
5,Jessica is soo IRESISTIBLE!,"Jessica has changed her music alot since her debut ablum ""Sweet Kisses."" ""Irresistible"" has more pop dance music. Jessica finally has more dancing in her videos and her concerts. Her music changed so much. This ablum is the most best CD I have on my CD rack.Jessica has more singing experience than anyone out there. I highly recommend this CD who likes POP music. Trust me this CD is DA BOMB!"
3,"I love Jess, but the CD was very disapointing","Jessica Simpson has one of the best voices out there today, but unfortunately this album doesn't show it. It is full of overproduced pop songs. They hyped this CD forever on her website, and I was so excited to hear it. The CD is overproduced. In most of the songs her voice is drowned out by the music. I was looking forward to hearint the duet with Marc Anthony, but you can't hear their voices clearly on that song either. I would love to hear them do that song live. ""His eye is on the sparrow"" is the highlight of the CD. It is really awesome. Unfortunately, it doesn't go with her new image."
3,More than sweet kisses....,"In times where blonde hair and great voices walk together,Jessica Simpson seems to not care about to be ""another blonde diva"" and give all her voice to this album so irrisistible like it's own name...Jessica mixes a lot of rythms on this album wich promises to be a smash hit,a mark on her well succeed carrea(and long if she wants!).Congratulations Jessica!!"
3,Prefer 1st album a lil bit over 2nd!!!,"I bought this album yesterday & I gotta admit that I thought it was gonna be a lil bit better than it was. Since I am a big fan of R&B and Jessica said that the album would be more R&Bish, I decided to give it a try. The ballads kinda bored me, but uptempos like 'Hot Like Fire', 'A Little Bit', and 'Irresistible' kept me listening. The cd as a whole is good, but, it is not great or the best one out there. And IMO, if Christina Aguilera was given some of the songs on the album, I think she would have sung them better."
5,FANTASTIC!!!,"This is a great Cd. I was a little dissapointed in here last Cd, but not this Cd. I think she did a way better job than her last. Irresistible has all kinds of different types of music for everyone to hear. There is pop,R&B;,Gospel,fast,slow,happy,sad etc. One of my fave songs is A Little Bit. It shows a really talented R&B; side of her. Other songs I like are Irresistible, There you were (Duet with Mark Anthony), What's it gonna be (Britney Style), Hot like fire, and for your love. Also for the people who don't like gospel music, well you'll love this one. I thought it was going to be boring too, but when I heard it I was shocked to hear that it was a good song. Jessica Simpson is very talented in Gospel Music just like all the other types of music. One think that I think would be better for the Cd would be to put her lyrics in her Cd. She doesn't have it again like the last. But this Cd is still worth the money, and that's why it deserves five stars.Congrats to Jessica!!!"
4,It works when you don't overdo it,"When Jessica Simpson first came out with the song ""I Wanna Love You Forever"", I remember my sister hearing her voice and asking, ""Why is she screaming?"" Jessica appeared to be oversinging in songs that weren't even loud (maybe she was following Faith Evans' example?). But fortunately she toned things down on her second album.The beginning of the album is songs you've heard already: the title track and ""A Little Bit"". Those songs are good in their own way, but there are also other great songs like the outstanding ballads ""For Your Love"" and her duet with Marc Anthony, ""There You Were"". And the obligatory end-of-album gospel song ""His Eye Is On The Sparrow"" is still worth mentioning.If it weren't for ""Imagination"" (with its cheesy chorus) and ""What's It Gonna Be"", this might have been a perfect album. Oh well, with this sophomore release, Jessica Simpson proved that she is indeed Irresistible. Oh, and the album is good too."
1,junk,"I borrowed this cd after hearing a bunch people rambling on and on about amazing her voice is.Please, she sounds like a slightly more gifted Britney spears and is given the same old generic pop material which should all be [discarded.]It's just awful that music which is incredibly shallow and predictable is made these days.Good thing Jessica simpson is no longer with us, because she was just another addition to all the pop garbage out there.Don't we have enough of that already?"
4,More Ballads!,I wish she'd sing more of those powerful ballads that she's so good at doing. She has such a beautiful voice. I'm not saying that she's bad at singing fast songs. Her fast songs are usually catchy and her voice isn't bad at all. I just love her voice when she sings those ballads and I just wish she'd do more of them in future albums.
3,The uptempo tracks sound like the same...,"Jessica Simpson's 2nd album sees her singing more tempo R&B numbers, which is not exactly a well-justified move. For one, most of the uptempo tracks suffer from lacklustre melody lines. In fact, apart from sounding like filler material, they also sound suspiciously like they came from the same producer. Jessica Simpson's voice is not bad, but she is really one singer who can only shine best in ballads. Her style comes off a tad predictable in the fast songs. After a few times of listening, her voice notwithstanding powerful, began to bore me. I would rate this a 3-star album, based on Jessica Simpson's well-rendered power ballads. However, the rest of the album is repetitive-sounding and leaves little of an impression."
2,"Okay, but it's really missing something","I don't like Irresistible as much as I did in 2001. Its obvious failure was to give Jessica a sexier look to compete with Britney and Christina. Didn't work. The songs lack the excitement of the debut or her latest ""In This Skin."" The title song and her duet with Mark Anthony were both good. But Jessica takes it to church with her soulful ""His Eye Is On The Sparrow!"" Very uplifting and spirtually moving! But those three strong ones are better than the other songs. Jessica just didn't find the right material to match with her voice 3 years ago."
2,"Maybe next album, Jess",This cd sounds like it was written by a twelve year old. Come on Jessica! I wish that she would create her own path in the music industry instead of just trying to imitate and become Britney. One Britney is enough. Jessica has such a beautiful voice that I am sad to see it go to waste on an album like this.
3,better,"If any of you heard Jessica's first cd it was horrible. This cd is definitely better but it is far from perfect. I like all of the songs on the cd except for ""what's it gonna be"", ""imagination"", ""for your love"", and ""I Never"". . Since there are only 12 tracks on the cd that means that 1/3 of the cd is bad. The reason I don't like those songs is because they are uncreative and corny. Jessica has a great voice but the songs on this album don't cut it. Even though there are some good songs here, for 18 bucks they aren't really worth it."
2,Sell Out Simpson,"Jessica Simpson, the only teen act who can actually give Christina Aguilera a run for her money with vocal talent seems lost, pumping out Mandy and Britney-esque songs on this new album. After hearing her live talent, which inspired me to buy her first album, I was sadly disapointed with this latest effort. Not because the songs aren't catchy or radio-friendly, but because again she doesn't get the chance to express her full talent. This girl can actually sing but is held to pre-recorded phone conversations (sound familiar all you Britney fans?) and R&B-flavored flops. The one redeeming factor for this album is that, overall, it -is- better than her first."
3,Songs for High School Students With Low IQ's,"Although Miss Jessica Simpson can sing, the sorry songs on ""Irresistible"" do not help her case with intelligent fans. In the song ""What's It Gonna Be,"" there are the inspired lyrics ""Are you gonna be a dog or a gen-tle-man?"" If I had a dime for as many times as I heard the words ""played,"" as in ""you played me, boy,"" I would be rich. Even her last song, ""His Eye Is On the Sparrow,"" a nod to her beginnings as a Christian music singer, does not lift the listener to the heavens, despite a huge gospel choir.A couple of songs on here are memorable, such as ""Hot Like Fire"" and the title track. But I wouldn't buy this CD."
2,Anything but 'irresistible',"While Jessica Simpson's voice has been comapred to Mariah's, that statement remains unproven since Jessica has a long way to go before her songs take to a more decent turn along with her horrible vocals.The only reason why I considered buying this CD was because of the song ""Irresistible"" which sounded irresistible after listening to it for a few times, but it soon became ""resistible"" after listening to her horrible vocals on the other tracks. Too high pitched and too annoying. Not only does Jessica Simpson's vocals hurt to listen to, but so do the horrible melodies on each of the songs. The only really decent songs that I would favor on this CD would be ""A Little Bit"" and ""Irresistible"".Until Jessica Simpson's annoying voice it tamed and she finds better ballads to sing, only then will I be satisfied."
1,Don't waste your money on this album!,"I bought this CD because I really liked the song ""Irresistible."" I was really hoping the rest of the CD would be good, but I was greatly dissapointed. The rest of the CD .... If a CD single of ""Irresistible"" comes out, buy that because it is a good song. Otherwise, just tape it off the radio."
1,You've Got To Be Kidding!,"YOU MEAN PEOPLE ACTUALLY BUY THIS GARBAGE?!?!???? I'd rather stick hot steel spikes in my eyes than to ever hear this trash again! AND THE MUSIC INDUSTRY WONDERS WHY SALES ARE DOWN! WELL, DUUUUUUUUHH!!!!!"
1,A WASTE OF MONEY,"The only song I liked on this CD was ""Irresistible"" but I soon became sick of it.I just don't like this CD. I was expecting more on this one because it's her second one. I liked her first CD better than this one but I am also sick of that one. I sold this one because it was just a waste of money to me to have even bought it in the first place. The songs just don't have any real depth to them--they don't really sing about anything deep nor do they have a very clear theme.Also her voice is just not wide in octave range.And what's up with the picture on the cover of the CD with Jessica lifting up her shirt and touching her stomach???Britney wanna-bee???"
1,BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Trust me you DO NOT want to own this CD! I mean, seriously how fake can you get? First let me comment on something that doesn't really have to do with her voice but how ugh she is! I mean she is really annoying, she starts wearing tight leather and stuff and being all slutty when she acted all sweet and innocent before! She's going way down hill! I mean she changed her voice completely, and she's obviously become really fake, 'cause she wants more cash! I mean a lot of people are in it for the dough, but at least they're original, I mean she just copies everyone she can! Just one question I gotta ask you Jessica, you said you were dumping your boyfriend to focus on your carrer, What carrer?????????????????????????"
1,Complete garbage!,"Jessica Simpson's second album Irresistible is an awful and over-produced pop album. There are only 2 good tracks, What's It Gonna Be and For Your Love. The rest of the album is silly and soulless. This album flopped and it's not hard to see why. Leave this one in the dumpster."
4,Better than the first one,"Ya know, her debut had only a couple of strong tracks, or rather the best one was ""I wanna love you forever"" so buying the whole album sounds kind of tough when it is only one song that i was really after.But this album is much better, what can i say...she looks great, sound great, and she's a wonderful Christian too. Overall, i'd say that this one is much more worth the money 'cause you'd want to listen to more than just ""a couple of tracks"" and witht he maturity in her voice and style, this is the definitely getting somewhere.So if you're struggling to decide which is the better album, this is it, period."
4,Sophomore Effort,"Jessica Simpson's second album is better than her debut. The sound on here is more R&B and pop than her debut. The title track was one of my favorite singles from that year, and remains one of my favorite tracks by her. Too bad there was only one other single, ""A Little Bit"", which didn't do too well. There album has a lot of great ballads like ""For Your Love"", ""When You Told Me You Love Me"", ""Forever In Your Eyes"", and ""To Fall In Love"". There's some good uptempos too like ""I Never"", ""Hot Like Fire"" and ""What's It Gonna Be"". Overall a fairly good effort."
1,I WISH I COULD GIVE IT ZERO!,"Seriously now, some people just can't stand not being britney (uhm Jessica) But after a while it just gets pathetic, sad and desperate! I mean dying your hair to look like her hair. Changing to outfits almost identical to britney's, changing your voice which obviously shows that you're not a true musical artist, you just do whatever it takes to get in the top 10! And oh guess what I just realized Jessica just happens to fit into all of these categorys, why isn't that a strange coinsedence? I certainly think so! I mean, Britney is ok, but there are a lot of people who can't stand her so if they ever hear or see Jessica they'll be throwing garbage cans at her, even the people who think Britney's ok, will really hate someone that trys to be the Pop Princess! Beacuase the'yre probably loyal fans or whatever or they'll just get sick of it! Sorry Jessica, but either way they'll really hate you a lot! You just don't have what it takes!"
2,ok,"Sure this girl could be put alongside Mandy Moore and of course Britney Spears because why? because she sings pop!but ok I admit, she can sing yeah she can but since her first album she's gone way over pop and is trying to be r&b...;she has been brainwashed... she's a britney spears clone... I know that she is better than that and she could be more successful if she kept to herself and stayed away from being someone else.. buy this cd for the voice not the music..."
3,"""Irresistible or Not""","I was impressed with Jessica's amazing vocals on her 1st single, ""I Wanna Love You Forever."" When I first heard the lead single ""Irresistible,"" off this album I knew I had to get the cd. So when it came out I was kind of dissapointed. The cd was like Britney and Christina's cds. I expexted more from Jessica. Here's the review of the first 4 singles off the disc. One * being the lowest and five * being the highest.""Irresistible"" - *****""A Little Bit"" - ****1/2""Forever in Your Eyes"" - **""Hot Like Fire"" - ****"
3,she is a good singer,"Jessica Simpson needs a fashion makeover please.Tommy Motola and the other schmucks at sony are trying to ruin the career of one talented vocalist. This album showcases a maturer souding voice than her debut Sweet Kisses. She has the abiliy to actually sing her songs rather than show off vocal gymnastics. I hope that she continues to grow as an rtist and people realize she is the best teen singer out there. Yes, better than Britany and Christina and she eats and looks healthy"
4,"Jessica Simpson's ""Irresistible!""","Jessica Simpson's second Album, ""Irresistible"", is definetely a keeper and one worth having. On this one, Jessica REALLY went for a more mature ""Grown up"" attitude and she has some good songs. I think the money i paid was worth it, but i think that this album wasn't as good as the first... if you are trying to decide if you will like it, buy it, you will! You will be dancing and singing along to it for hours... Anyway, I really enjoy it... U Will Too!!!"
5,all 5 stars,"i like jessica si mpson alot because, first,i adore her song irresistable and second of all she so cute, funny, andso lovely.also, my best friend's name is also jessica and has a great voice just like her.thanks."
4,Good Clamp,As with the entire quick grip products the features that should entice you to buy and use the Quick-Grip 512 Bar Clamp are the ease of adjustment and the fact that it won't mar even the softest of wood yet still provide ample force for your project. People with low hand strength or hand pain can use the trigger ratchet used for the adjustment with ease. It only requires a firm squeeze just over the pressure used for scissors.

3,Important info for writers,"This book contains all of the rules and mistakes that writers of any sort should know about. It is not especially fun to read, but Zinsser keeps it interesting with concise information and great examples. This is a resource I will refer back to forever."
3,Simple and useful,"A well written book (could it be different?) that you can pleasantly read despite of the ""tedious"" topic"
2,"Let's keep to writing, not politics.","Zinsser was a professor at Yale during the sixties and sadly it shows. Throughout this book he constantly illustrates writing points he is trying to make by using political anecdotes, all of which presume the reader shares his liberal bias.In a section on eloquence he writes, ""The cadences of Jefferson, Lincoln, Curchill, Roosevelt and Adlai Stevenson came rolling down to me. (The cadences of Eisenhower, Nixon and Reagan did not.)"" OK. I'll spot him Ike and Nixon. But Reagan? He earned the title ""The Great Communicator"" and was teamed with a truly eloquent and gifted speechwriter, Peggy Noonan.In the following paragraph he cites Mario Cuomo and Jesse Jackson as two who have restored his faith in the nobility of language as a means of addressing the populace. Cuomo maybe, but Jackson?This book is dated and tiresome. Save your money and time and instead read something truly useful such as ""When Words Collide""."
5,A Wonderful Tool,"William Zinsser is the master of placing your derailed writing back on the track. Our culture seems to demand haughty language intended more to impress than to communicate. Zinsser reminds us to simplify our writing, drop the clich√©s and improve through revision.Zinsser is an accomplished writer and I thoroughly enjoyed On Writing Well. I can imagine reading this book once a year to improve my writing fitness."
4,classic writing guide,There's a good reason why this is the 25th Anniversay Edition of THE classic writing instruction book. William Zinsser is a legend and this book is very helpful for professional writers and those hoping to join the profession.
2,Sullied by hypocrisy,"Zinsser writes a book about clear writing and allows himself to regularly veer off course with political commentary. Such an offense as elevating Adlai Stevensen to the level of Jefferson and Churchill (!) while simultaneously diminishing Reagan cannot pass unnoticed by the reader. If you can manage to set aside this bile as it bubbles up, you'll find the book worthwhile. If you cannot, you will be enraged at the hypocrisy demonstrated by this otherwise competent writer. Zinsser's editor should have clipped him."
4,Excellent reference,"Excellent reference for writers, college students, and anyone else looking to improve their writing. I felt pretty secure in my writing style, so I purchased the book more out of curiosity. After reading the first few chapters, and applying the guidance offered in the book, my next paper put my past papers to shame.This book is excellent for those who write well and want to write even better."
5,A writing and editing handbook,"As newspaper editor, I quote Zinsser frequently and discuss passages from ""On Writing Well"" with reporters of all skill levels. He is the flag bearer for all editors -- when you write, tell the story clearly and concisely. Zinsser tells us how to do it -- clearly, concisely and with a style that keeps you coming back."
2,2 Way radio non compatable,"This idem has a cutout for the antenna on the right side. My Motorola radio has it's antenna on the left side, all 2 way radios are this way.Talk BucketBoss into a cutout on both sides or two models."
1,Poor quality,"I purchased one of the Bucket Boss cell phone holsters about three months ago and wore it daily until it fell off of my belt! The rivet that holds the clip on the back had worn through the flimsy material. Prior to that I had trouble fastening the velcro closure because the material that the velcro hooks into no longer had any material that the velcro could latch onto, all the small fibers were straight and not looped. I am very dissatisfied with this product and I feel that it was manufactured from inferior material as well as having poor craftsmanship. I have purchased many other Bucket Boss products and I suggest that you stop selling this piece of junk!"
4,It's what I wanted,"The Bucket Boss Brand 54000 Cell Phone Holster fromBucket Boss is great. I've only had it a couple of days and it keeps my cell handy. My only complaint is the Bucket Boss logo was sown on very poorly. The logo was off by over a 1/4 inch, it looked so bad that I cut it off. Would I buy another one YES"
1,Backpack was too small,Company would not let us exchange it. I don't feel like this was very good customer service. Stay away. Very disappointed.
4,Very Good CD,"This is a very good CD from a great band. And that's the problem. From almost any other band I'd think this is a superb effort, but nothing here compares to Too Far to Care or Wreck your Life. ""Lonely Holiday"" and ""Crash on the Barrelhead"" are the two songs that come the closest. But it still beats 98% of the dreck thats being put out today."
4,Rock Still Lives in 1999,"""Murder"" was cute (and the reason I bought this CD), but eventually overplayed on the radio. ""19"" is more introspective. ""Jagged"" sounds reminiscent of Del Amitri. ""Oppenheimer"", ""Indefinitely"", and ""Busted Afternoon"" (with a cool dulcimer)are my favourite teacks here. I also like the last 2 songs ""Let the Idiot Speak"" and ""Valentine"". My least favourite track is ""Crash on the Barrelhead"", which is a little too morbid for my tastes (but that's just my oppinion)."
4,Pop music at its best,"I'm a late-comer when it came to jumping on the Old 97's wagon, but when I heard ""Murder (or a Heart Attack)"" earlier this year, I knew I had to get the CD. The songwriting here is fresh, witty and irresistible. Yes, it's poppy, but that isn't a sin if it's done so infectiously and as inspired as it is here. One of the best this year.Best tracks: ""Murder,"" ""Indefinitely,"" ""Busted Afternoon,"" ""Nineteen,"" ""Oppenheimer,"" ""Valentine""... actually, all the songs are great."
3,Still Better than Most,"Well...I must admit that this is my least favorite Old 97s album. Still, I listen to it more than most of my CDs. It doesn't come anywhere near the brilliance of ""Too Far to Care"" and doesn't have the soul of the earliest albums, but is still very good listening from track one to the end. I rate it a three as I want Rhett and company to get back to their roots. I hate accidentally hearing them on pop stations after I hit scan. Still, for Old 97s fans it is definitely worth buying."
4,"Still the great Old 97's, but without the edges","I'm a devoted Old 97's fan, so I rushed out yesterday morning to buy Fight Songs. On the first play-through, I found myself continually flipping ahead to the next track, trying to find the ""edgy"" songs which would remind me of earlier albums. While I didn't find any, I still think this CD is a great collection. Some fans will say the group has ""sold out"" to the label this time, but, even though a bit more mainstream, Fight Songs still offers up the same proof as its predecessors: these guys are incredible songwriters. And I'm sure it will grow on me more with each playing, same as Wreck Your Life and Too Far to Care."
2,Disappointed...,"I eagerly awaited this album. I heard the band play a few of these songs in concert back in January. I thought they were excellent. But somebody thought it was a brilliant idea to overproduce the songs, tone down the instruments, and soften Rhett's voice. While the songwriting remains strong, the production is too much. I heard someplace that Rhett was concerned about sounding like the Rembrandts. He should be concerned. They still remain one of the best live bands out there."
1,"Don't buy it here, it's at your used CD store","Argh! I bought this CD after hearing 'Murder' on the radio. But Fight Songs is not what I expected. If you're into '70's muzak, then this CD's for you. Since I don't like the Eagles, I sold mine to Amoeba."
2,Not worth the money,"Insincere, lightweight pop without emotion. Decent guitar work, but hardly worth the money."
2,"Generic, forgettable pop","I listen to a lot of alt country and thought I should check these guys out based on all the talk I've heard. My high water mark of the past couple of years has been 6 String Drag's High Hat. Fight Songs starts strong on 'Jagged', but after that it's really boring. There's nothing distinctive here, and there's probably 1000's of bands out there that sound just like this. On the first listen I found myself wanting the disc to end so that I could hear Jack Logan's new Buzz Me In (a great album) that was next in my changer. I'll try one of their older albums because I suspect the band still has merit, but this one does nothing for me and will soon be gathering dust on my CD rack."
1,Less-Than-Mediocre,"Mid-tempo schmaltz. I knew nothing of Old 97s, so I wasn't disappointed by the loss of twang as I was by the overall ""Hootie-ishness"" of the entire CD. For the most part, and here I'll exempt the catchy ""Jagged,"" the songs are less than mediocre and beg for some kind of passion, artfulness or just a plain kick in the pants."
1,"decent, but ""too far to care"" is much, much better","Fight Songs really disappointed me. I first bought ""Too Far to Care,"" and that cd is a masterpiece; definitely one of my all favorites. ""Fight Songs"" is a big step down from their previous three cds."
1,The music sounded like old 45's scratchy,If this is old 97's I have never heard it before. Do you do any 70's music?
2,Are you guys deaf?,"I'm sorry. I know that the 97's have been putting out great music over the past five years, but this album is boring. It is a pop album and a lot of the twang is gone. But, I differentiate this effort by the fact that the creativity is gone too far to care. Better luck next time. I wonder if they will bother."
1,Fight Songs lovers: please don't see Old 97s live. Thanks.,"What's really frustrating is that all the people who've called this ""the best album ever"" are the ones who buy up all the tickets to the 97s shows online when they play a small show. Thanks..."
4,"Poppy, Crunchy, Alt-Country Good-Time Tunes","The Old 97's remind me of the Refreshments and the Gin Blossoms, but yet their lyrics are better crafted. I could almost say the lyrics are Paul Westerberg-ish, but not quite. Two words can describe the lyrics: Witty and Intelligent. The music is poppy, and catchy, and at times remind me of the Eagles from their later days. The first track on this album is very crunchy, almost Neil Young like. Their stuff is worth a listen if you're a fan of Wilco, Sun Volt, Uncle Tupelo, the Refreshments, the Replacements, and Gin Blossoms. I guess now I'm going to have to get some of their earlier releases."
5,Best of '99 So Far,"I am a sucker for pop music, and this CD grabs you and doesn't stop through every single cut. While some have called this a sell out CD, in my view it is a great leap forward in mature pop songwriting. Great musical hooks, intelligent lyrics and a rockin good time. Can't say enough about this CD which will definitely be on my top 10 of 99 along with Fountains of Wayne, Splitsville (technically '98) and Marvelous 3."
1,HORRIBLE and I'll watch anything about Queen.,"I rented this from Netflix and thank goodness I didn't even pay a buck at Redbox. I will watch anything about Queen or Freddie Mercury. Well this, this absolutely stunk. I mean, just horrrible. There is a narrator who clearly is bored out of his mind with his job. Then there are mostly just views and pics of modern England. That's about it! Oh and a hideous sketch of the band, very few pics of them, and that's about it. In my opinion, do not buy this, even if you are a hardcore fan. Ive read biographies about Freddie, watched lots of videos and docs, this..ohmygosh..nothing to do with Queen."
4,Interesting facts - great price,"I don't agree with the negative reviews that have been posted here. Ok, granted - there is no actual footage of the band or performances, etc. But, this is clearly stated in the info posted. READ PEOPLE!What you do find here are interesting facts and stories that are fun! Frankly, at this price you can't expect a Ken Burns type of documentary. It comes from a fan's perspective which is actually refreshing for a change. Some great footage of locales from the early years of the band, funny acedotes and the like.All in all, the purists expecting the definitive biography of the band won't find it here... but I personally really enjoyed watching this program and plan on getting and watching the others too."
1,Boring,This story supposedly written by a former guard just documents the standard prison corruption that apparently has been going on as long as there have been prisons and world wide. It just doesnt provide any interesting info or a solid story line. It was another book I chose not to finish reading
3,"Visually beautiful, but...","This movie is spectacularly pretty. As always, Binoche is luminous and as for Martinez...Oooh-la-la! The costumes, the scenery, the architecture are a visual feast. But the plot is merely ok (at times ridiculously implausible) and the handsome Martinez plays his role in a painfully two-dimensional manner (toss hair, pout, gaze smokily, strut off in an offended ""huff,"" repeat 32 times)."
2,Stars for Angelo,"If you are simply looking for the pleasure of watching a very good looking Italian for 2 hrs then by all means get this movie. Its one of the few ""romances"" which I actually enjoyed the parts before the h/H met more then once they had. The pursuit of Angelo was the most exciting part of the movie, unfortunatly the people chasing him are dead before the first half of the movie is over, and we,re left watching Angelo escort a woman across France who loves another man. Ultimatly this was the source of all the problems I had with the movie. I was never able to get beyond the fact that the heroine was in love with one man while she was supposedly falling in love with Angelo? I never really saw where she stopped loving her husband and started loving him. This just doesn't work as a romance."
1,Boring.,"Apparently, I have no love of French films. Slow, boring, and it's no wonder British and American films do better at the box office."
2,Don't bother,"Everything is this epic film seems forced and unauthentic. Forced emotions. Not much depth or realism to the plot. Terrible dialogues. Some nice cinematography and beautiful bodies, however."
2,too much horse riding and running not enough plot,"I certainly don't need a thousand words to sum this movie up. BORING!!!! I felt obligated to see it through to the end because I had spent good money on it, but it was a total waste of time and electricity."
4,The Horseman on the Roof,"Very good movie, however sad. Very good performances by Olivier Martinez and Juliette Brioche. This was a good story and I enjoyed watching it."
3,"Good Period Piece, Excellent Score, but Anticlimactic Ending","Just watched this last night. I really love watching Binoche's work and I enjoyed the movie, the score, and the faithful (at least it appeared so) depiction of life in europe at the time. At least up to the end - It left you with a feeling of ""that's it?""...if the movie could be another 3 hours or so it would have been much more satisfying"
2,Help! Save me from the epidemic!,"This movie was horrible! The images were graphic and numerous. Enough bloated bodies already. The main characters were beautiful but other than that, who cares? My favorite character was the cat."
5,Very cool toy,This figure is great! It's super articulated and detailed! Even this guys TOES bend! I love it! Toy Biz did very good.
3,Kid loved it but not a kid toy,"My son is four and of course, loves all the action figures. This toy is simply a green Ken doll on a pedastal. He was so excited to get the toy and literally jumped for joy upon it's arrival. Unfortunately, another child threw it on the ground and it exploded. My son and his dad have repaired the toy with gorilla glue and my son is happy with that. I however, am not happy with having paid nearly $40.00 for the thing."
5,An early Sagan work still relevant today.,"Sagan's gifted style of writing manages to take difficult topics and present them in a readable, fascinating, and thought provoking manner. Sagan's works should be required reading in any high school science class."
4,dragons of eden,This book is an excellent account of how human intelligence probably evolved. It should be compulsary reading for all students majoring in phychology.
4,Great stuff but dated,Sagan is great at explaining science and you can tell his love for it in this book. My only problem with it is that it was written in 1977 so some of the topics are a bit dated. Other than that it is a great read and would recommend to anyone.
3,The Dragons of Eden by Carl Sagan,"The book is a bit dated of course as it was written in the 1970's, but the material and the presentation appeared to be timeless. I had never read much by Dr. Sagan prior to reading this and this was a great introduction to his clear thinking and writing style. His theories on anthropology will remain current but it was humorous to read of new computer games, such as Pong and Space Wars."
4,Be sure to buy the crate at the same time!,"I've had real difficulty finding a crate to fit this product. They claim to fit a ""standard"" 13"" crate, but most crates are now a bit larger, I believe, in order to hold file folders. Be sure and order the Bucket Boss with the crate to avoid frustration."
5,Non Spill Tool Bucket,"This is a great product. When fully loaded it will not tip over in your truck. More room than a 5 gallon bucket system. Easier to carry than a bucket too. Tons of pockets ,holds way too many tools."
2,"In Ding Dong-Milo 101 , this TONY ORLANDO is an another person.","It is thought that TONY ORLANDO was an another person. It is thought that everything was understood if this ""DING DONG"" and ""YOU AND ONLY YOU"" were heard. Wasn't this age in the name of TONY ORLANDO because MILO 101 was put on the market in 1959 yet?"
4,nokia n80,great phone come with lots of feathers all u expect from a good nokia.one down side is it's size but other than tat great phone
4,Patterns in Ibsen's canon,"This book-length study ties all Ibsen's dramatic works together with an underlying motif pattern first articulated in Cataline, an early verse work. By identifying the same elements -- happy home in the valley, dangerous climb to the heights, two child-deaths, etc. -- in each of Ibsen's works, Hurt reveals autobiographical elements imbedded in symbolic structures. For example, Hedda Gabler contains two ""child-deaths,"" Lovborg's manuscript and Hedda's unwanted pregnancy. While occasionally struggling with his examples, Hurt succeeds in removing Ibsen from a mere front-runner in chamber theatre to a significant psychological observer of the human condition."
2,I must be missing something,"I've listened to the album twice now, and had to turn it off both times because I thought it was so horrible. I was hoping for an energetic album seething with satire and wit. Instead, I find I've purchased a melancholy collection of crap. I was really disappointed with this one."
1,So very dissapointing,"I am a big BFF fan, but this was the worst of their cds. I can't believe I bought it. Time to convert to Yanni. From, Roger Dorn"
3,eh...I don't know...,"I love the band, but this record was just lacking in good lyrics and most of the songs were just too cheesy for my tastes. However, I thought that Don't Change your Plans For Me and Magic were just beautiful...practically worth it just for those and the few other good tracks. But all in all, I thought the lyrics were a bit forced, as if trying to live up to some expectation. I hated Your Redneck Past, for instance. I was just like, ""what a dumb, dumb, song!"" We need more songs like Selfless, Cold...and Steven's Last Night in Town!"
1,a huge dissapointment from one of the greatest bands around,"I was so excited to buy this CD because all of the other ones that I ahve a re spectaculer. But, when I got home and listened to it i was wholey dissapointed. They have strayed soo far from their first CD, which was excuisite, that I wanter to cry."
3,Buy Whatever and ever amen first!,"So you can see why I like this cd, but am also slightly let down by it. Is so polished. Wheres the humor, its no fun, its a mature album I guess. I loved it but only played it for about 2 weeks, for ""ARMY"". I guess I was just trying to hold on to that ""whatever and ever amen"" feeling. Their live performances are awesome though. Buy this cd. But make sure you buy ""whatever and ever first"""
4,One that grows on you...,"When first listening, one misses the fun of BFF's previous outings...though it became the perfect accompaniment to a lazy Saturday afternoon. Am I the only one that heard some old Chicago with those horns? Also, you know they're going mainstream by the fact that this album sounds very smooth and shiny...guess they've moved on from their old NC apartment..."
5,BFF are not radio wonders...,"If you've listened to this album, you know that it is not meant to compete with the Spice Girls and Hanson for radio airplay. This is music, kids, not celluloid meant to catch the ears of 12 year olds. Ben Folds and his band have produced an album which captures sheer emotion, not record company marketing. Those Ben Fold Five fans that are disappointed by this album obviously never listened past the singles on Whatever and Ever. Messner takes up where the band left off on songs like 'Fair', and 'Smoke'...creating a mood, rather than a halfhearted grab at radio time. I love this album, there is far more to it than is intially felt. I admit I had my doubts after my first listen, but the music grows on you, as good music does, and I love every minute."
2,DISAPPOINTED!,"I am a huge Ben Folds Five fan and I was so pumped up about this new release and then the day I got it from Amazon.com, I popped it in and I was very disappointed by how bad the CD actually. ""Army"" and ""Don't Change Your Plans"" are the only two good tracks on the disc!"
4,"great band, great album","in a time when all rock music seems to sound the same, these guys always manage to amaze me because of how different they sound. i have all of their albums and i think that this is the best one. At first i expected a whole album of songs that sound like their last hit ""brick"", but this album is nothing like that. They have a large range of sound between songs and there isnt a bad song on this album. Another great album from Ben Folds Five"
4,Last in a line of great records,"Narcolepsy is a great song by a great band who made great use of what radio was playing at the time. Only in the mid 90s could you hear Ministry, Ben Folds and Johnny Cash on regular commercial radio. I miss those days, but this album came out at the end of that era and is proof that you could have been both commercial and take risks at the same time."
3,Good,Just recently discovered Ben Folds or at least to the point I owe anything by his. Got Rockin' The Suburbs. Classic album and can't get enough so thought I'd try something else. Play probably 10 times now and like it but not like RTS.
4,Another favorite,"This album wasn't as great as the first two BFF CDs or any of Folds newer albums. However, after seeing Folds live performing some of these songs, it makes me appreciate them much more.Don't Change Your Plans, Mess, Army, and Magic are my top three favorites. If you've seen Folds live, you've heard the story behind Army. Plus, it's much fun when he has the audience split in two and sing the horn section part. Don't Change Your Plans was the first song he performed at the recent St. Louis show in June. It's one of my top Folds' songs besides One Angry Dwarf. It's a long song, but put together quite well. I'll have to agree with the other reviewers on the album.Your Redneck Past seems to be a filler song, though. It's kind of an odd goofy song."
3,A departure for the punk band,"I bought the CD expecting to find it to be like their past albums; comedic, hard-hitting piano and guitar riffs, and strong drums, with an occasional ballad. However, their latest release left me dissapointed in that respect. Yet the band is trying to expand their horizons, and I say, more power to them. The more I listen to it, the more I like it."
5,Emotional and musical variety,"From the almost symphonic ""Narcolepsy"" to the sheer fun of ""Your Redneck Past,"" the ethereal ""Magic"" to the fast-paced ""Regrets,"" the mellow ""Jane"" to the catchy ""Army,"" every one of the songs on this album is distinctive and beautiful. Ben seems to be writing songs that are even more autobiographical and emotional, and it really works. The lyrics pull you in and the music sweeps you away."
1,A bad knock-off of seventies rock and nineties grunge,"Ben Folds seems to have overstepped his bounds once too often, and this album greatly emphasizes this point. Folds is minimally talented, as is his band, but on their previous recordings, they seemed to understand that they were a band lucky to have a contract. With Messner, however, they've attempted to present a massive tour-de-force, yet end up sounding like a drunken garage band. I would recommend this album to BFF completists only."
2,"I thought about the Army, however...","My wife owns the Live CD and Rockin' the Suburbs. Both are excellent Ben Folds CDs. He plays fun piano based songs with clever, interesting lyrics. I got this CD because I like his live version of Army and wanted to have the studio version.However, Army is almost the only good thing on this CD. I also like Redneck Past. After that, I haven't found anything all that exciting. So my advice is to get Rockin and Live and skip this one. Sorry Ben."
2,Greatly Disappointing,"Given that I only have one other album by Ben Folds -- Whatever and Ever Amen -- I can't write a review as someone that is all-knowing about this group. The best explanation that I have for rating Reinhold so low is that I see is as an incredible drop-off from Whatever. Whatever is melodic, flowing, somewhat raw, and if you have ever been in love, can be incredibly intense. Reinhold is disjointed, quirky in a bad way (I consider, say, Beck, to be quirky in a GOOD way), and overproduced. I don't know what else to say. That being said, this is only MY humble opinion, and I am definately comparing this album to one a hold a high affinity for. If I heard Reinhold without ever hearing anything else by Ben Folds, I might even rate it three stars. Either way, this guy is gifted as hell, so don't take my word as Final."
2,Wannabees,"I bought this, I admit, for the title, only to have it turn out that these guys didn't know Reinhold Messner, but used the name for fake IDs. That's consistent with the sound of the album, which sounds like a bunch of suburban white guys who would like to be musicians, but um, aren't. (They remind me of Social Distortion, with a lighter sound.)"
2,It is Ok,"The only songs that I think are good are Army, Your Redneck Past, and Jane. The other songs are not bad, but just kind of there. They have no bite."
4,ben folds can do no wrong,"While many claim it cannot compare to 'Whatever and Ever Amen' this newest album sure sates my desire for new material. The rhythms and melodies are tight, varied and beg repetition. One must turn the volume up and wail along. Nothing can compare to a band's first release, ones first exposure to a new style that simply blows you away, but TUBORM sure comes close. I give it 4 stars only so I may await an opportunity to give an upcoming BFF album 5."
4,Haunting...,"This was hardly the album most BFF fans expected upon its release in 1999, myself included. Looking back, it wasn't the radical departure most fans claimed it was. Ben's tender side had always popped up here and there on his previous albums. It just came through most prominently on this one. This a seemless collection of haunting lyrics and gorgeous melodies that begs to be played from start to finish.BFF called it quits shortly after they released this. I saw one of their last shows at the University of Vermont's Patrick Gym in April of 2000 and it remains one of the very best concerts I've ever seen. They should have released a full live album."
5,"A departure, and an incredible one","Well, I knew that the boys would have to change their sound a little by now, and I'm quite happy with the result. More eclectic and more involved but still as quirky and catchy as ever, this CD is simply amazing. Apparently, his success has allowed Ben to tap into ever more varied resources, and on this album, most of the tracks contain strings and horns, giving the whole CD a somewhat orchestral feel. For those who were liked the ""punk for sissies"" aspect, there's Army and Your Redneck Past. Basically, there's something for everybody. Buy this CD NOW."
5,"I expected excellence, and they delivered","Hats off to Ben Folds Five. What an album. Some of the tracks are simply sublime. If I could award Grammy's I would give one to ""Narcolepsy."" It is true that there are fewer rockin' tunes on ""Reinhold"" than on albums past, and more ballads than usual, but the musicianship and intelligent songwriting is apparent in every digital moment."
5,Still a great band,"Ben Folds Five has always put out consistently great music. And they still do. This album gets better with each listen. Contrary to most reviews on this page, all the tracks are great."
5,This is one the coolest CD I own!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have the album ""Whatever and Ever Amen"" and I think it is awesome but this new one tops it by far. I love the lyrics to all the songs. All the songs are awesome. This is defintly one to add to your CD collection. I find myself listening to the whole thing at least once a day."
2,Replaces humor and insight of past CDs with self-indulgence,"I was disappointed. None of the play that was obvious in any of the other 3 CDs seems to be in this release. It's a ""think too hard"" kind of album. I don't mind thinking, but I don't like overthinking. The issues (rejection as a child, etc.) don't seem that different than the last releases, but the sense of humor about them has grown into dark obsession. Maybe I'll get into it, but I doubt I'll like it better than ""Sgt. Pepper."" I can almost say that about the first CD and ""Whatever and Ever Amen,"" though. Oh well . . . he never promised me a rose garden."
3,A good effort into murky water music,"With 'Reinhold' you can't tell if it's a step up or a step away, from their last album. I enjoyed Narcolepsy, and Mess for their unique sounds, and some of the other songs sounded like a Pink Floyd or a Queen (and that's fine too). The mellow edge is why I bought this album, but one good rock song would make this more digestable."
3,Lush but lackluster sounds from Ben Folds Five,"After getting pumped and going to the local music store to pick up BF5's new CD, I hurried home to listen to it. Expecting to hear some piano-driven rockin' tunes, I was sadly disappointed. Though ""narcolepsy"" has a bit of a hook in it with the clever piano melody, it fails to deliver the same energy apparent on ""Whatever and Ever, Amen."" In all the reviews of this album I have previously seen, nearly everyone has said ...""even though it doesn't rock as hard..."" or, ""though it is much softer..."" Am I the only one who appreciated BF5 for their 3-piece rock n'roll and catchy hooks?? Sure, ""Army,"" is pretty good, and will probably be THE single, but that seems to be the only one. All of the horns and strings are a nice touch, but they simply take away the musical space that Ben, Darren and Robert deserve. Nice try guys, but maybe you should get back to basics."
3,Capsule Review - The Unauthorized Biography...,"After a couple of gems, and an increasing popularity, Ben Folds returned with a more subdued yet more slickly produced third album. With only one foot-stamping anthem in Army, Folds relies more on string-laden balladry (Mess, Don't Change Your Plans) and ambitious multi-layered efforts (Narcolepsy) and this works to varying effect. Overall, this is the weakest of BFF's studio efforts, though the aforementioned tracks at least make it worth the while."
3,"BF5 can do better than that, even though it's not bad","This album is three in a half stars, but it is the weakest of Ben Folds Five's three albums. The songs are more pessimistic and depressing (Jane, for example), and although that is a part of this concept album, it does not work for the band. Ben Folds Five's fame comes from their catchy tunes that can be found on the band's earlier works such as ""Whatever and Ever Amen"". This album is completely different on this album. These hooks aren't completely nonexistent: ""Army"" and ""Your Redneck Past"" are very catchy. But as a whole, most of this album isn't as good. One of the eleven tracks is a filler, too, so it's short. It clocks in at just over forty minutes.The album does have its moments, it's just hard to get into."
5,Largely Misunderstood,"After reading other customer reviews, it seems that many were confused by what Ben Folds Five was doing with this album. ""Reinhold Messner"" covers a lifespan in reverse, starting with death and then moving backwards through time. ""Narcolepsy"" portrays having to face the inevitability of death, even when not ready (""I'm going to sleep...but i'm not tired""). ""Magic"" presents loved ones coping and coming to terms with an impending death (""we knew you'd be gone as soon as you could, and I hoped you would""). ""Hospital Song"" is about the first time you face your own mortality, and the denial that often results from it.This album is nearly a masterpiece in my opinion, and one of the better ""concept"" albums to come along in quite some time. BFF refused to release a carbon copy of ""Whatever and Ever, Amen"" and instead chose to take their formula and improve upon it. Definitely 5 starts in my book."
4,Ben Folds Five catches me again...,"I am a HUGE Ben Folds Five Fan....I bought this CD the day of its release....I have every single one of their releases, including REINHOLD MESSNER. Again, my fav band makes me laugh and cry on this fab CD...the only thing that's keeping it from getting 5 stars is the lack of angry ballads....crashing piano is the thing Ben Folds does best, but there's only two funny songs on here...but I love all the slow songs. ""Don't Change Your Plans"" makes me cry, and ""Mess"" is just amazing. I would heartily reccomend buying this CD whatever kind of music you live for. It's magic."
3,RESPECT,"Gents- is a very special book that I think you will not forget so fast.The location, a public toilet is the main topic in this book. Although it`s interesting because it concerns with racism and respect. The story line deals with problems between the lavatory workers and the ""reptiles"". (Men who come to the place and have casual sex with other strange men in the cubicle).If you are looking for something else than the usual lecture I would really advise you to read this book. It is a grat experience and I am sure it will activate you to think about it. So be tolerant and have respect towards people who are different from you and your expetations."
1,"Review on ""Gents""","Gents, as the name already says, is the main place where everything happens. Ez, Jason and Mr. Reynolds all from Jamaica work there every day and have to deal with ""reptiles"". Gents isn't only used for urinals, it is also used for cottaging. In this novel you can read about different opinions on this public sexual action and come to your own conclusions."
1,ordered picture but not what received,I ordered what was pictured but received something totally different. The company didn't have what was pictured. They took back the nonwanted item. The company doesn't seem very organized.
5,The most important numismatic book in the world.,"This is the ultimate book on American numismatics, and I use it almost every day. Walter Breen was the most dedicated researcher imaginable. There are hundreds of mistakes in the book, but there are millions of things he got right, so the errors are mostly insignificant. A++"
5,"If you're interested in collecting coins, buy this book.","This is _the_ reference book for coins. Ok, it doesn't haveprices. It does provide everything else that you need toknow as a novice collector. I have been collecting sinceI was 8 years old. I still use this book constantly. Twodecades later. It lists thousands of coins (most areillustrated.) and has hundreds of references for furtherstudy. Buy this book now, ignorance is expensive."
2,Not a real journal,I always use a travel journal when I go to Europe. I like to try new ones for every trip. This journal looked so cute & trendy. When i got it.... i realize that it is all it is. Not very functional. It pretty much is just colored paper without any writing lines on it.
1,Broken,I ordered this item as a stocking stuffer for my girlfriend figuring it'd be useful with her laptop. Turns out it didn't retract correctly and ending up breaking before she could ever use it.
2,Why so patronizing?,"Normally, this is the type of sci-fi that I like - a broad opera covering many events that lead up to a grand conclusion. However, Anderson's writing style makes getting through these books a chore, with only paragraphs here and there that bring it to life and make it worthwhile. It seems like every time he describes anything he has to lug out the thesaurus and ensure to include at least three adjectives. In addition, you are constantly reminded in depth of events that took place just a few chapters back. Overall, I get the sense that Anderson doesn't think too highly of his audience - that or he's shooting for the wrong audience altogther. The dialogue is trite and unrealistic - no one that I know speaks like his characters, especially when they are relating to intimate friends. I kept reading for the story line, but I have to admit, I put this book and the previous down a few times, promising that I wasn't going back."
4,Worth the read,"Another promising entry in the series, you won't be disappointed if you pick this book up and read it from cover to cover."
4,Good epic saga,"After reading the first book in this series, the main problem I had with it was that it started so slow. I was optimistic that this book would be better because it didn't have to introduce everything that the first book did. Fortunately, that did seem to be the case.This book had a lot more action than the first. It did still drag in a few places, but overall, it kept moving right from the start. It had the same good characters and settings that were set up in the first book, and it introduces some new things as well. About the biggest problem I had with this book is that it seems that the scope of the series is so large that it will be hard to satisfactorily reslove. But I'll reserve judgement on that until I see how it is done.If you read the first book in this series, you'll definitely want to continue with this one. Also, this has left me even more eager to get the next book."
4,The story continues to unfold.,"The characters are pretty much the same, Five years have passed.The story continues to unfold and am looking forward to see whatJess has discovered and how this plays into the overall story."
3,Went from Great to Worse,"I am a huge Last Exile fan. However, the series went downhill from here. The reason I liked Last Exile was because it was different from all the other animes. The computer-generated graphics actually make the battle scenes interesting, instead of some stupid DBZ stunt. Another thing I liked about it was there were no ""bizarre love triangles"" up until this point. Now it seems as though every character likes another character and that character likes everyone else...and does a few along the way. This volume, however, isn't a complete failure. The beginning of the volume starts out great, and you will watch the first episodes more than once if you buy this DVD, guaranteed. But the new ""bizarre love triangle"" just made everything too complicated near the end. There are enough plot twists in here that if you didn't watch this DVD, you would be missing a lot in the rest of the volumes. I recommend that you buy it, it just won't be as enjoyable as the first three."
2,Not good quality,The first two weeks was great. The foam cushions went flat afterwards. I am only 125 lbs and hoping it would last at least five months or more. These are better off for kids..... Not recommended for adults.
2,Not appropriate for use on toilet,First of all what's with the image in the plastic wrap complete with label and reflections. It's difficult to judge the dimensions of the hole and that's the entire problem for the purpose suggested.
2,"Disappointed, I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews","This product is great for the first few days, especially when I was using it before I had removed it from the plastic wrap it was encased in. Soon after removal, and normal use, it has lost its shape and does not provide the same comforting cushion it did in the first couple of days. I am currently not able to get relief by using it and am searching for a replacement because it no longer relieves the discomfort experienced around my tailbone.It may be a magic foam but the only magical thing about it is how fast it lost its resilient ability to cushion the body.If you only need comfort for a couple days, buy this. If you're looking for a longer term solution, you might consider something else. I'm giving this two stars because it did do the job for the first several days of use so will provide someone with temporary relief if they have the money to spend on replacements."
2,Useless,"I am giving this two stars because maybe it would work well for someone weighing under a hundred pounds. For me, at twice that, the cushion is about as useless as it could get. I may as well be sitting on an empty pillow case, as it compresses down to nothing the moment I sit on it. The cushion is beyond soft, it is virtually non-existent."
4,An overlooked classic of the 70's,"These two brothers write songs like it's nobody's business. I LOVED this album when it came out and never forgot it. Now on disc, it's a testament to the great songwriters of the 70's - even if some tracks are a bit over-arranged - it is an overlooked classic from the brothers that wrote the Association's ""Never My Love""."
1,"Very disappointing, poorly quality","When I bought this pump, at first I liked the comfort and feel of it. That was very short lived. In a matter of just two weeks, I had two piston assemblys break, then after replacing that, the handle broke completely in two! This pump was not abused or misused at all. My daughter was weaning at the time so it was only used 2-3 times per day for maybe a month and that's pushing it. Very disappointing product. Would not recommend this at all."
1,Terrible pump - don't waste your money,"This pump was terrible. I am a first time mom, and I hated this pump. I bought it thinking that the convenience of pumping into bags and putting them straight into the freezer then popping them straight into a bottle would be great. But the pump doesn't actually pump. It does on occasion, but not enough to efficiently pump at all. There are a lot of very small pieces that you have to take off every time you pump to clean it too. It was also noisy (rackety). I couldn't pump in the same room as my baby, it would wake him up every time. I suggest to get any other pump that you are comfortable with (I went with a nice yellow one) and then get the breast milk storage kit if you still want to pump into the liners, The kit has attachments that fit nearly all breast pumps and you can still pump into liners with any other pump. This pump was a total waste of money!!!"
5,works for me,"works well, comfortable, quick, washes up well in dish washer or by handgood choice for the occasional pumper"
2,Not their best effort.,"I ordered this because we have enjoyed Hayseed Dixie, but this is not their best effort. It seemed forced. Some of the tracks were fun, but it was really hard to get through the whole CD....definitly not one to replay over and over..."
3,to hard to open,"i wanted something to help hold when gluing small things around the houe and shoes. I am not strong enough, using both hands at the same time!, to open even a little."
4,Overkill for the job i bought them for,"However, that's not a knock on the product. that's why four stars instead of five. i thought they would be closer to what i was already using but turned out to be too strong for the job. they are well made, light in weight, and have VERY strong clamping pressure. if you need a one inch clamp with strong pressure, these are for you."
5,Classic,"I find this a really good cd, for its age it was well recorded. There is only one track I am not crazy about. But some of the guitar work on the other tracks reminds me of Albert Collins, it's very good."
4,It's worth it,"I bought this album only to get the song ""Are You Ready,"" which is such a great overlooked rock/pop/soul/gospel/blues/psychedelic masterpiece that it is worth the price of the entire album."
3,um,I got this movie late last year hoping it might distract me from my unhappy life at the time But i was dissapointed by this film it just seemed a little dull. TO ME not my favorite crawford outing I liked autumn leaves better
3,Mediocre fare for Crawford fans,"Very average mobster film elevated only by Crawford's star presence as she channels several incarnations of her previous successful characters....there's a little Letty Lynton, a bit of Sadie McKee, Sadie Thompson and Crystal Allen, with a healthy dash of Mildred Pierce thrown in.Fun to watch Joan in action, spitting out vitriol in ""brassy dame"" speak, but it's a pretty weak picture. The transfer, however, is excellent and LOOKS wonderful.There's a fun little featuerette with some background info on the movie and its cast. Unfortunately, the commentary track by Director Vincent Sherman (the first interview I've ever had him where he didn't brag about his phsyical love affair with Crawford--refreshing!) is useless and offers no insight...the guy just rambles along telling you the plot of the exact movie you're watching. Any directorial anecdotes and/or background info is almost nonexistent."
3,Some fine examples presented but kinda out of date,Found some useful examples in this book but also found it out of date in a lot of areas. It really needs to be updated. For those interested in a more recent treatment of this subject (February 2011) I invite them to readSelf-Publishing Your Book--A Nuts And Bolts Approach.
5,A thoroughly pleasant reading experience,"I was extremely pleased with this book. I think the authors did an exemplary job of discussing the intricacies of the publishing industry. This book is sophisticated, yet simply written for all to understand. I believe I now have the insight and encouragement to travel the road to becoming a successful author. If you are an inspiring author like me, then this book is a must read. Thank you for all the hard work you put into your book. It is apparent that you take your work seriously !!!"
3,Very Basic,"This book is ok. However, it assumes you have no knowledge of the self-publishing industry. It helps you determine if you should self-publish (with a checklist).If you are simply entertaining the idea of self-publishing, or if you're looking for an introductory book, then this is it. However you will most definitely need to buy other books before you can actually produce your first book."
2,Still have serious SW bugs,"I used the Treo650 with PlanPlus, but it can not sync the ""Task"" with Palm. FranklinCovey only announced this is a bug, but there is still no solution until now. Please notice this bug before you purchased this SW."
4,A great sequel.,"A great sequel to the original Outpost. Well scripted and acted, you will enjoy the trip back to our favorite bunker."
5,Awesome!,"Not having viewed the original, I bought this Blu-Ray. I could not have been more pleased. Good story. Good acting, and great production. All through the film, I kept thinking that Catherine Steadman could resurrect the Alien(s) series. She is a good actress, and has what it takes to do an action film. Could she be ""Newt""??? If we ignore Alien 3 and 4, why not??? She has my vote. Anyway, this is a good film. My dollars well spent. Enjoy..."
4,good sequel,"It was a good movie and I wasn't sure how they would continue from the first but they did a good job, a little stretching for the end however."
2,Waste of money...,This video was just not very good nor did it really tell you much about the camera. They basically went through the screens and left you on your own. It was a complete waste of money. I ended up buying another video from VAAST which is 100% better and explains the features of the camera to you much better an in detail.I would not buy this video again and if I had my choice I would not have bought it the first time either if I had known...
5,Quick Grip Clamp,"Great price, and really does a nice job of holding the pieces together. Was surpised and how much grip it had, given its light weight."
5,Great for hobbies,I use these while building model airplanes. I like that they are easily operated and adjusted with one hand.
3,Don't look at the picture and think it's big,"Don't look at the picture and think it's big. Use the given dimension""4-1/4"" max. jaw opening, 1-3/16"" throat depth"" to figure out if it fitsyour need. If you are building a deck, this may not what you should buy."
4,fun but way too easy,"For starters i bought this because i am a 21 year old dork that loves curious george! It ended up being a pretty fun game but just too easy! I beat it like 4 times already and ended up selling it. It does get boring after you beat it but overall the game was fun. It is also great for younger kids. i would recommend this game to anyone who has little ones and just wants a clean, easy, and fun game. Or you just like curious George!"
1,Total Disappointment,"This ""talking head"" video covers all the topics of boating, but provides little or no useful information you can take with you on the water. It is well produced but void of real content. I was very disappointed in it and would not recommend its purchase to anyone.The format throughout is a woman lecturing. She does a fine job of reading the scripts, but I expected much more from a DVD. Topics like trailering, docking, knots, navigation, and more would have been excellent if actual video of boats had been used to demonstrate. Instead, its just 3 hours of a nice lady lecturing, and a few marginally useful graphics. This DVD is little more than a book read onto a DVD and much less useful than a book.I'm still looking for a good DVD or video that demonstrates boating tips, as such a video would be very useful to beginners or others."
2,Not what I expected,"This DVD is pretty worthless, it's just one lady talking the whole time.. hardly any boating video showing you examples or practical advice. each section is a minute long it seems and barely covers any actual material."
3,Commissioned Back in the Day,"This video was fun to watch. It's a very old Commissioned concert. It looks as though a family member taped the concert. It's a good quality, but nothing fancy. The volume is not loud. There are no bells and whistles, just Commissioned singing with the original members of the group. Take a walk down memory lane and be blessed."
4,A rare find,"It is rare in today's politically correct climate to find an interracial love story that does not posture or pose. Doris White's novel is tender and true; brave in its innocence. The story of Keziah and Shaw a most accurate portrayal of the rural south of this century, where whites and blacks were inextricably bound together and irrefutable divided. I recommend this novel to open minds and hopeful hearts."
1,you can only get 3/4 of the story,"Realy liked the series; but after spending $150 I was upset to find out , after watching it for a long time, they never finished making it. They leave you up in the air. They never made volume 4. So as the whole thing is falling apart you can't find out what happens. The family is splitting as is the business..............There's a part four in the book ( which I don't have ) Think they shoud make you aware they are not going to let you in on the ending before you buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Definitely Rising,"This yute has a good voice, the lyrical content is acceptable (but nothing ground-breakingly deep) and the majority of the tracks are well produced. If you're familiar with Sizzla's early works, then you are familiar with this albums production team becuase they come from the same camp (Xterminator). You'll hear familar beats on tracks like ""Life Goes One"", ""Just Can't Stop"", and ""Friends Like These"". This album is comparable to Sizzla'a early albums, but not as great (hence the 4 stars). Definitely better that Sizzla's current works though. Rising is an album to get if not only to sample good, new talent from the conscious dancehall genre."
5,True Stories,"I love reading hard-to-believe-but-true stories! I don't know if it's because I enjoy telling the stories to all my friends, or because the stories are just so entertaining! This book was filled with stories. Some about helping out your community, some about pets, some about tragedies, and some about natural disasters. For example, there's a story about a girl who survived a tornado, a girl pitching in to make the hospital she's so often in better for children, and so many more! I found the book to be rather short, but still enjoyable. I recommend it to any girl who likes American Girl books, wants an easy read, or loves to pass on good stories!"
5,Quick Grip Clamp,"This is an excelent product. Easy to use in clamping and release of materials. The easiest clamp I've ever owned. I recommend this product to anyone with numerous woodworking projects, in glue ups, and holding of material. It save lots of time and energy."
3,It didn't work on my computer,"I bought this for my grandson because my kids played with it when they were teenagers. All the Carmen San Diego games were great (fun and educational) Sadly, that's the problem. The games are an older version and I could not make it install on my computer."
5,Maxwell is the creator of the peace and happiness in my soul,In all of Maxwell's music he has created a new type of R&B for all listeners. I am I vocalist and at the age of 15 I was already deeply entangled in the sounds of Maxwell and his music. This new song has only brought more respect to Maxwell and a smile to me. (He is also gorgeous!)
3,"""Fortunate""Is The Most Commercial Single of Maxwell","I Like His Music Style. ""Ascention"" From His First Album Is My Favorite Song. And I Got Presure By This Song Also.But I Don't Want Maxwell To Be More Commercial.""Fortunate"" Is Heard Like A Vocal Group 's Single. I Think His Music Should Be More ......"
5,I have never been so taken by any other artists .,"There are no words that can describe Maxwell talent. He shows that there are no limits to how far an entertainer can go. I hope that in my career, I am just as sucessful and innovative as he is."
4,:-(,I didn't realize that this was a single. I paid too much for it. More than what the album would be worth but the song is fantastic.
5,SMASHING,WHEN I FIRST HEARD FORTUNATE I FELT A DIFFERENT VIBE THEN I REALIZED THAT IT WAS A R. KELLY PRODUCTION ANYWHO MAXWELL REALLY PERSONALIZED THIS SONG EVENTHOUGH IT WRITTEN BY SOMEONE ELSE I FELT THE ENERGY AND PASSION THAT WENT INTO EVERY VERSE THAT IS THE WAY THAT HE SINGS EVERY SONG BIG UP MAXIE NEVER DUG A SONG QUITE LIKE THIS
2,puzzling book,This book looked very interesting but when using the preview mode I saw that the index and covers are in English but the text appears in many languages but not English.Beware!
2,"Nice material, lame straps","Bought this apron looking for something for shop use. Turns out its a bit short for the shop, and the pockets fill with sawdust. The neck loop is really uncomfortable even with empty pockets. About the only plus is the material quality. Duluth has a similar design with much better yoke straps."
5,Good deal,"I rather think that this product is good for the dad that loves to fix things around the house and is always yelling for someone to go get him his wrench. With the tool bib, the wrench is right there, AND! unlike tool belts we don't have to worry about any sagging pants."
2,Suspenders Version Of This Product,"Note that I didn't buy this since I noticed right away that it had a NECK STRAP! I'm sure that is not a good thing once those measuring devices and tools accumulate in the convienient pockets of the bib along with the pencils.Actually, Bucket Brothers does offer a bib that uses suspenders (smart) rather than the neck strap that this model uses. Amazon DOES NOT offer the suspenders-version as far as I can tell.It's called the ""Fire Hose"" model. I'd suggest looking that up on the internet like I did since the neck strap is a non-starter ... I don't want the neck strap digging-in and making me feel non-comfy in addition to my eye-protection, ear-protection and anti-dust equipment.Anyway, I've ordered my FH equivalent of this from another internet source.Craig"
3,Ok bib,"This is a decent enough bib, a little shorter than I had hoped, but it gets the job done. The material seems like it will hold up pretty well. Made in Thailand."
4,Well made bib.,"This is a quality bib. I would have given it five stars, except that it could be improved by changing the strap that goes around your neck. If you put much in the bib, the nylon strap rubs and cuts into the back of your neck. A shirt collar helps, but I often work in a t-shirt. If they made a padded section around the neck, I'd give it five stars."
2,shop bib review,The bib material is A OK but the quick release buckle was of very poor quality and will not stay closed. I am currently looking for another buckle that I can have someone with a heavy duty sewing machine will replace.
2,great way to damage floors,"I'm sure this apron works great for some jobs. But if your job requires you to ever bend down, in any way shape or form, be prepared to dump all your tools on the floor. Hopefully at that moment you won't be working over let's say a brand new hardwood floor.I was really excited when I first saw this apron and it is one step up from wearing a framing belt when your doing finish work....but you must train yourself to hold onto EVERY tool when bending over. Maybe it didn't fit me well or something, but it didn't work for me. It now lives rolled up in the back of the truck.remodel finish carpenter"
2,A better bib apron else where,I bought this apron and a couple others at Amazon and ended up returning all of them. On this model the neck is somewhat uncomfortable and the snap kind of cheap.I ended up going to Sears where they have either the waist double row apron and bib apron made out of heavy cotton canvas for $5.99. The bib apron at Sears is all white.
2,"Poor design, inadequate materials","Drywall screws poke right through the fabric into my flesh. I tried putting a carpenter's pencil in the pocket as in the picture, but it jabs me in the gut every time I bend over. Worse, and completely unforgivable, is the hammer loop. It won't hold itself open, and a rubberized hammer handle will stick to it, forcing you to use two hands to replace your hammer. That appears to be only a temporary inconvenience, though, since the fabric is unravelling and I figure I have about 40 hours longer until the loop completely disintegrates.I'm going back to the old leather belt."
3,Lighter weight than expected,I bought this to replace a Grizzley one that the pockets seperated. This is the exact same design except the cloth is much lighter weight. I guess I will see how long this lasts. Teh strap is also funky. I goes over your back shoulder then snaps to the waist belt. I feel like I am being strangled. Get rid of the strap from the neck to the waist band.
4,"A strange collection, but enjoyable.","I bought this CD primarily for two tracks on it that are hard to find, ""Hard to Get"" by Gisele MacKenzie and ""That's All I Want from You"" by Jaye P. Morgan. I certainly was not disappointed, but it is a very strange collection. It includes one piece (Kay Starr's ""Rock and Roll Waltz"") that is not at all difficult to find, a few hits that are hard to come by (like the two I mentioned above and Mindy Carson's ""Candy and Cake""), some obscure songs by famous artists (like a Rosemary Clooney song I'd never heard of before), and the third-best charting song by a two-hit wonder (a Gogi Grant piece). But on balance, it's a pleasant collection to listen to, even if I am totally mystified as to what prompted the choices."
1,Very Low end - Not very professional - Training very basic,I have been coaching and playing keeper for over 30 years I have been researching video's for training goalkeepers and coaches and this one is not very good. First you need to have all players involved in proper equipment.They have one keeper in tennis shoes. It is shot and put together very shoddy. When a keeper makes a mistake in technique and there are many they don't correct it.It is designed to give you a set number of drills that is it. The drills are very basic. It shows some technique correctly but I would not recommend it for any coach or player learning to train or play keeper.
5,Excellent For All Soccer Goalies!,"Quality soccer drills & techniques that work when players put time and effort into improving this skill.Included but limited to in this video are: Goalkeeping Conditioning Drills, Lateral Skill Techniques, Diving Skills & Drills, Punting Techniques, Breakaway Goalie Defense, Fun Games, Advanced Skills Bonus Tips and more. The brilliance of this program is the quality of drills explained. Like any sports skill, nothing happens just by observing. Players must take the bull by the horns and go with it! And yes, this is an excellent product for beginning goalies through advanced. Long live The great game of soccer!VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
5,PERFECT FOR ASPIRING GOALIES! ON THE ROAD TO MORE SHUTOUTS!,Excellent training product. Well-organized and easy to use as a top soccer goalie training resource. I coach a U12 team and I have seen considerable improvement with my son who plays goalie for our team. We purchased this wonderful program in the summer and began practicing twice a week.We kept referring back to the program and soon we were out there practicing four days a week. The drills in this become addictive for soccer players wholove the goalie position. My son's improvement and enthusiasm for soccer has been incredible! We both owe a lot to 34 SOCCER GOALIE DRILLS. This is by far the best soccer investment I ever made! Highly recommended.
1,Not Recommended,"Unless you are desperate for new drills, don't waste your money on this DVD. The drills are OK, but that's about it. Ball handling is terrible. Who wants to watch drills, where the technique is wrong."
2,less popular Christie story,"This is one of the less popular Agatha Christie stories. The plot is mundane, but what makes this video terrible is the injection of 1980 US cultural values into a 1950 story. The clothes worn by the heroine are repulsively ugly. They make an average shaped woman look deformed with a flat chest and a back with projections that most women would be happy to have in front. Notice the turned up collars which were just as ugly then as they are now. The hero is not convincing as a technology nerd."
3,monotonous,When details rated this album 8 out of 10...i was really looking forward to it...since details mag is notoriously picky about their album reviews...its good if you're into it...but all i can say is...you better damn well had just broke up with your girlfriend...or your dog got run over to really appreciat this gloomy apocalyptic album.
3,"This album is great, if you are Skeletor.","I really dig some of the tracks on this album, but it seems like Source Direct is getting lazy and definitely limiting themselves by resorting only to the dark stuff. Their track on the first Metalheadz comp is so much more envolved, that i don't understand where their new stuff is coming from. I do have to admit though, that ""Tecnical Wafare"" is really tight. It's very scary and I'd love to see it used as a soundtrack for a good sci-fi horror flick or something. Maybe alien 5? Mostly, the beats are a bit simple though, I like them better when they had the Hidden Agenda feel to them. If they could be scary and Hidden-Agenda-ish, Then I'd be really impressed."
2,"Not good, too bad - for the fan...","If you buy this CD just to hear some good music, or some good dnb or whateva, then your wrong. I read from some reviews that it was supposed to be dark. Well, I didn't need the flashlight I bought with me after all to listen. Maybe the reviewers just heard it during some polar night, but for me it's just another one of those ""old-sounding"" dnb albums. And one more thing. If you think that light(/airy/mellodic) dnb is fast then your mistaken again. 'Cause this album is despite it's lightness slow as a snail. No fun."
2,"Nothing new, or worth repeating here.","A friend of mine, knowing that I love Photek, told me I should buy this one. Boy was he wrong! I only found one track on this CD worth listening to, Concealed Identity. Other than that I found the Beats re-hashed (that same old dnb loop from the early '90s, ugh!) the fx cheesy and the bass lines absolutely unfunky. Dark? Please, give me a break. Do the Telletubbies keep you up at night? Go buy some Square Pusher or Photek instead."
2,Stale beats; go with Controlled Developments instead,"I'm a big fan of Source Direct, Photek, and the rest of the kings in the techstep wing of the jungle movement. However, this is one album too avoid. For one, two tracks (""Call and Response"" and ""Capital D"") can be found on Controlled Developments. For another, the beats are way, way too slow and simple. They're not deceptively simple, they're just simple. The production values are high -- Source Direct loves those clean, crisp breakbeats. But the rhythmic structure is just too bland. And the songs aren't pulled together in any kind of theme. Controlled Developments is the much better album (the songs are more inspired, there's much better bass, and there aren't any repeats)."
5,A gentle mental embrace.,"Unable to sleep one night, I switched on the radio which is preset to a station that does not cater to the common background noise of traditional radio. I became enveloped in gentle, soulfully smooth sound that had a clarity and presence one usually only senses when actually present with the intruments in a small, intimate coffee house or cafe. The music, ""House Made of Dawn"" by Coyote Oldman, was truly a gentle breath of fresh air in a world of mindless, often pretentious noise."
2,Too bland...,I don't care much for this CD. It is too bland or boring. There are no tempos or beat to any of the list..
5,A camping necessity,"This cookbook is indespensable when camping. Pie iron cooking is so easy, flexible (you can get really creative), and the kids can do it, too (with your supervision, of course!). Don't pass it up"
2,Disappointment,"I also ordered Rome's #2011 Creative Pie Iron Cooking Book and found many of the receipes were also in the book Pie Iron Receipes. Save yourself some money and just buy one or the other. And just to warn you I found the book Rome's #2011 Creative Pie Iron Cooking Book at a camping store for almost half of the cost Amazon charges. Just to clarify, the camping store did not have the book on sale, their normal price was almost half what Amazon charged. I found the booklet to be very small and not worth the price I was charged. With that said I did find the receipes interesting and plan to try some of them in the near future. To wrap up my review...the receipes were good but I was overcharged for the book. I think $7.99 to $8.99 would be a fair price to charge."
5,Let's fight!,"Track 2 is excellent, The Sailor-Song. It's so funny. Also, Best Friend and Eenie, Meenie, Miney, Mo."
5,Great pop!,Toy-Box sound a lot like Aqua but they are still unique in their own way. All the songs are great but most of them do have sexual undertones. I would reccomend this album for kids over 15 and adults too.
1,"""Kids"" will love it!",This CD is made for little children. The lyrics are stupid and the music sounds exactly like aqua.
5,"Come on, get it on, here's some good music.","Toy-Box is irresistible. Their tracks are so uplifting and got some great beats. For a really good time, hear the bonus tracks, especially Best Friend (Elephant & Castle Version)!"
5,Too good to be true?,"I don't think so. They're even better. If you haven't heard FanTastic, get it now! You won't be disappointed. Best Friend is #1."
5,Fashion Boxout,That girl Anila has some great fashion sense. Check out that red. And she knows how to tell a guy off. Go Toy-Box!
5,Hoo ha hoo ha,"Why does a guy say it when in the video, girls are doing it? Oh well. Best Friend rules!"
5,I Believe In You,I believe in my friends like I belive in this song. Listen to I Believe In You; you won't be sorry.
5,I Belive...,"I Believe In You is a song to believe in. Very calming effect. Also, What About and A Thing Called Love."
5,What About all the things...,What About is truly excellent. It's one of their more serious songs. Try it.
5,Could It Be These Two?,"Could it be these twoThat we've been searching so hard to findYes it couldYes it wouldIt's probably these twoWe can't get enough of Toy-Box. Their lyrics are so freaky and cool. All the tracks are slamming. And DEFINITELY get the bonus tracks, especially Best Friend (Elephant & Castle Version)."
4,"Excellent functionality, pads eventually loosen","I'm typing this review using an ICEPad I bought 4 1/2 years ago, under a 12"" iBook. I've used the ICEPad constantly during that time, mostly as a heat shield while using the computer in my lap, but also as a desk stand while travelling with the computer.The one Achilles heel of the stand is that with long-term use the glue (some sort of rubber cement) binding the rubber pads to the plastic frame gets loosened by heat and/or friction, and pads start coming loose. This is more of a nuisance than a fatal flaw, and considering the amount of use I've given the device and how long it took for this to start happening, it's a minor issue. On the whole this is an ideal stand for a small (12-14"") notebook computer."
2,Not stable,This stand is too flimsy for my large laptop. It might work for a smaller one. A much better solution is the Allsop Metal Art Notgebook Stand.
2,ok product,It does not quite do all the functions it advertises. That folded position in the picture it will only do on a table. Odd being that it is for your lap. The gripy parts are nice and do keep the computer from sliding but the overall construction does feel a little weak. An ok buy but i would look around for somthing else.
1,Informative and Boring,"Not what we were expecting. It was informative, but boring. Good for getting to sleep if you can't fall asleep...that's how boring it is."
4,Guide to Copyright Law & Publishing,"Great resource book. I'm involved with permissions editing, and this answered several of the questions I had."
4,USEFUL WRITER'S RESOURCE,"This is a good explanation of copyright law for current writers. It also explains how the law has changed over the last several years, so you can even determine how to apply older rules to older materials you want to utilize."
5,ESSENTIAL FOR ALL WRITERS!,"This book is a sine qua non for any and every writer! Read this book prior to sending out ANY manuscripts!

4,Spider-Man Collector Series,"I purchased this item for my son who is 4 for his birthday. He carries this Spider-Man every where he goes. He loves it. I have purchased another one for my 5 year old son for Christmas this year. My 5 year old tries to take it from my 4 year old all the time. It is a fun toy too have around. It looks just like the boy who played Spider-Man in the movie. For all those Spider-Man fans, this is a must have. I hope you enjoy this toy as much as we have. The mask on it is made of a rubber like substance, and is hard to get on, but we haven't taken it off, other than one time. It has not ripped on us, but you do have to be very careful, while putting it on."
1,Cheap ripping mask,"The rubber mask that comes with this toy ripped after 2 days leaving spidey maskless and my kid crying. For a 20 dollar toy, which is a little much for an action figure, this toy is not worth the aggrivation."
1,Poorly made,"I got this doll for my 3 year old grandson, while he was playing with it, the very first day we got it, his leg snapped off. The joint broke completely, and he was not playing rough with it...just carrying it around, by the head no less. He tried to take the mask off and...*SNAP* the leg came off."
3,"Good, but not really what I needed","I did not get any fresh ideas from this book. If you are already preparing earth friendly lunches i.e. using reusable containers most of this information will not be new to you. I was looking for some new recipes for lunches and I found that in ""Brown Bag Success"" by Sandra K. Nissenberg and Barbara Pearl."
5,The LapTop Lunches User's Guide,This guide is a very practical and easy to read guide to healthy lunch food for kids. It is especially relevent in these times of children and adult obesity in the United States.
2,"Bad movie, worst Blu-ray ...","I saw Peacock. What is this ? A great mistake. I like strange movies like ""Surveillance"" or ""Twin Peaks"". But Peacock is far from them. And the Video Quality of the Blu-ray ""Peacock"" here in Brasil is BAD !!!"
2,Creepy & Slow,"had potential but a real let down.....not worth the time to watch it. The acting was ok but life is too short to waste time watching such a boring movie. PASS, trust me."
1,Peacock,This movie was not what I expected. I thought it would be like Psycho was. It wasn't scary at all and was very disappointing since I love horror movies so much.
1,Oh Please...,No one knows it's him because he puts on a wig and some makeup? Oh please... Just didn't find it believable in the least. But Murphy is a great actor nonetheless.
2,I noiw know why it went straight to DVD,"When I first heard about this movie and it;s cast and then heard it went straight to DVD without theater realease I was very surprised. Until I watched it. This thing isn't a thriller at all. No suspense. The characters get no sympathy or concern. Murphy is doing an impersonation of Anthony Perkins from ""Pysco"". This movie seems to have been directed by someone who has never seen a movie before. I want my two hours back. Skip this one."
1,APB,"The letters of this review stand for Annoying, Pointless and Boring which about summarizes my thoughts on this movie. Anyone who gives this clunker more than one star had to have had a financial stake in it. Cillian Murphy in his ""Emma"" persona looks like Michael Jackson before his demise and Susan Sarandon looks puffy and ancient. The plot is slow and tedious and is devoid of any tension or surprises and any references to ""Psycho"" are way off base! Unless you have run out of NO-DOZ tablets and need a good night's sleep I advise you to avoid ""Peacock"" like the cover is laced with anthrax poison."
5,cracked pepper crackers are crackin' good,"I discovered Carr's Table Water Crackers one year during the holidays, and I fell in love. I often make a meal of cheese and crackers with a cup of coffee. The added zip of the cracked pepper in this version of the crackers inspired me to come up with toppings to equal the cracker itself. Cream cheese with diced tomatoes. Deli-thin slices of baked ham or roast beef with Swiss cheese, or sliced roast turkey with Muenster cheese. Super-thin slices of salami or pepperoni with sliced Mozzarella. Delicious!"
1,"Pretty Shady, Amazon","No, I love these crackers. I buy 'em all the time and they're pretty plain, but high quality and that cracked pepper gives a nice bit of zip to the taste that just makes it that much better.This SHOULD be a 5 star review; packaging was great, no crackers broken in the couple of boxes I've opened as of yet. Just not too bad at allEXCEPTThe order that I placed on May 8, 2007 came packed with 12 boxes of crackers that all expire on June 30, 2007.I've yet to see a single box of these crackers in the local stores with such an early expiration date.The nice price and the free shipping was quickly compromised by Amazon taking a batch of crackers with a short shelf life and pushing them on special. In the end, the loser is me. When calling Amazon with the hopes of a fair exchange or something a little reasonable, there was no flexibility.Lesson learned by me and a forewarning to others: Take caution purchasing perishables from Amazon.Shame on you, Amazon."
5,Smells great,This is a nice product. The soap smells wonderful and the box design is very pretty. Makes great teacher or hostess gifts.
2,I LIKE THE WAY THEY SING.,I LIKE THE WAY BLAQUE SOUND WHEN THEY SING 808. AND THE REMIX SHOW SOUNDED GOOD I WOULDLIKE TO HAVEBLAQUE AUTHOURGRAPH.
5,Track Listing,"This is a great Maxi single. I don't own it, but I've heard every song on it. Here is the REAL tracklisting for all who want to know1. 808 LP Version2. 808 Instrumental3. 808 Remix (She Ain't Got That Boom Like I Do)4. 808 Extended Remix"
5,okay for the absolute beginer .....,"before starting to play , the only thing i knew was that the bass had four strings and that it sounded nice and deep.my fingers had never felt a fret before ... i knew nothing more than that . this book is great for people like me , who are new to music and who are new to bass. it starts really easy and gives you the confidence. the accompnying cd is very good too. i would recomend it , but only if you are an absolute beginner ..after all, it is meant for such people !prasanna"
3,Bass Basics,This bass book would be a great starting point for any one just begining to play. All the basics are there and the C.D. that it comes with is helpful. But the book could have gone farther than the very simplistic bass lines that it taught. A very basic guide that would require you to buy another book immediatly.
2,Rambo meets the Ewings in Dallas. Hes alive again,"So if you read book one, Rambo dies, but now, play a fanfare.. he is alive again, maybe he has the same shower as Bobby ewing from the TV show dallas.They dont explain it,so you have to forget book one, but then, he goes over old turf from book one.A money making book, that abuses the intelligence of the readers. But its worth too stars."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Somehow, Rambo is still alive. Resurrection pills? Anyway, he is in the slammer, and gets the 'go and do something really dangerous for us' choice, and decides to do it. He has some friends in Vietnman he would like to rescue, after all.Again he gets shafted, but he is Rambo, and his name didn't become a catchphrase for nothing."
3,Telling when a CD a New One Is No Longer New-When It Has Been Openned,"I do not rmember if I purchased this new or not.So I an going to state that it was with all the sealing labels on it.When these Sealing Tapes under this Wrapping Cover are Removed IT HAS BEEN OPENNED.When any product has been openned it is the same way with a car,It is considered USED."
4,One Hit Wonder My Foot,"I saw this band perform in 1981 in a bar on the marina at Sodus Point, New York. They sucked live, and I drove 40 miles to find that that out! But I can tell you that in spite of this disappointment, I am a Tommy Tutone fan. Like a lot of ""one hit wonders"", Tommy Tutone has many more songs that are MUCH better than the one hit that, for some unknown reason, got the radio airplay. The depth of the songwriting on Tommy Tutone 2 is much deeper than the lyrics for 867-5301/Jenny would have you believe. ""Shadow On The Road Ahead"", ""Why Baby Why"", ""Which Man Are You"" and ""No Way To Cry"" stand out for me. And ""867-5309/Jenny"" is a hoot of a party song! I have not heard the releases after Tommy Tutone 2, but this album alone is worth the price of admission on a two-for-one CD."
5,Paw Prints in My Soul,"This book is great. Through her words she makes you feel her pain and all of the emotions she is going through. This book isn't JUST for animal lovers but for anyone. It really touched my heart because of the attachment I have to my own dog, and past dogs. I would recomend this book to everyone and every age. I would also recomend her book ""Angels in Disguise"" it is just as good, if not better!"
4,paw prints in my soul,"If you are someone who likes good reading, someone who loves animals and a fresh approach to how they touch our hearts! Then Lou Deans' book ""Paw Prints In My Soul"", is just your ticket. A book that is great for kids and adults alike. So, dig out the hankies, find your slippers and a fuzzy blanket, make it a time to remember as this is a book you'll never forget."
4,New Author for me,"I just started reading Cobens books. This one was really good. I thought Gone for Good was better though. I am looking forward to reading all his books. I recently got a kindle and it is awesome. My reading has really increased. I finally find myself reading instead of flipping thru the channels on tv looking for something to watch. I recommend this book for a fun read, and I highly, HIGHLY recommend getting a kindle!"
4,Humdinger!,"This is the first Harlan Coben book I've read, so I can't compare it to the others, but it is a humdinger! As easy to read as eating candy. A lot of twists and turns. The wrapup at the end is a little disappointing, but still well worth getting to."
3,Maybe a Third Chance...,"I picked this up, not having read any others bt\y this author--I'm behind the times--and discovered that he is prolific and sells well. Presumably he has improved since this early novel. The writing is so-so, but a step up from others in this genre, but it seemed a long way from the beginning when Dr. Marc Seidman wakes up after being shot and spends hundreds of pages searching for his presumed kidnapped daughter, until the resolution, which is to me somewhat contrived. From the reviews, I understand his series novel character is better. I may try one of them to see if there is more verve and interest."
1,Unbelievable.,"First, I find it unbelievable that so many readers have praise for this book. I enjoy Coben enormously and have tremendous respect for his work but this book reads as though he was being paid by the word and plot twist. Everyone has a friend who takes forever to get to the point, right? - who goes off on tangents or repeats or adds needless details. This is the book version.Second, the plot of this book is literally unbelievable. Once I got to the end and realized all the time I had wasted, I wished I had grabbed my ""second chance"" and put it aside early on.Do yourself a favor. Read another reviewer's comments titled: Spoilers/Time Savers. The author nails all of the ridiculous flaws. This will save you a lot of time and frustration."
4,No Second Chance,"For twelve days, Doctor Marc Seidman, a reconstructive surgeon, lie in the intensive care unit hooked to an IV, head covered in bandages. After awakening, Marc finds that he has been shot, wife Monica murdered, and four month old daughter Tara kidnapped. A ransom letter along with an untraceable cellular phone was sent to his father-in-law, Edgar, a very wealthy man of the community. The kidnappers are demanding two million dollars. They demand that Marc deliver the ransom and if he contacts the authorities or is followed by anyone, he will never see Tara again. Throughout the investigation, they come up with one suspect, Dr. Siedman himself. This book is a story of mystery and suspense. To find put who committed the crime and if Dr. Seidman ever gets his child back read No Second Chance by Harlan Coben."
2,Oops: a character glitch,"Only a few weeks ago I discovered the author, Coben. I read each new book in less than a day and loved how the characters rang true and believable. Then the woman in this book appeared. Do any of you readers agree with me that there is a loose thread at this book's end that must be attended to?"
3,"""No Second Chance"" not up to author's best!","While the author is an excellent writer, this one took too long to get to the ""heart"" of the story. He did not build suspense as good as usual, however, I am not ready to give up on this remarkable writer yet, and am willing to give him a ""second chance."""
2,Fast-paced but prepare to suspend ALL disbelief,"The strength of this novel is that it is an extremely quick read with a compelling plot. Unfortunately it falls prey to one of my biggest pet peeves with thrillers -- the main character does things no one would ever do, just to further the plot. SEMI-SPOILER: This might not be an issue with you if you can imagine a stranger from your past saying ""you know who shot you, don't you"" and you responding along the lines of being faintly puzzled and letting them wander out of your house without asking them for a clarification, even though you have no idea who did the deed and the answer to this question could help you unravel the mystery and possibly find your child. Just absurd. The ending makes only slightly more sense, and the author left some pretty thick loose ends just blowing in the wind. It was a pleasant enough way to pass a few hours, but I'm happy I picked it up at a garage sale, and I won't hesitate to send it on its way again."
4,"Another Page Turner, but implausible ending","I am on a marathon of Coben's book - I like the ride, his books are hard to put down, they get you caught up quickly. I think this one and Just One Look have one thing in common. They have a lot of bad things happening, including the violence, for not ""enough of a believable reason"" if you may. In other words, the means doesn't justify the end. But that is fiction, and he is good at it. You don't know this until the end however, and getting there is mesmerizing, so if you like the ride, then this is for you. There's lots going on and it is not boring.I will still keep reading him. I have liked Tell No One so far the best."
4,A bit convoluted...both an intriguing mix of ethics and love,"Coben may not be the best at this stuff, but I keep reading his books (another 3 word title--another 30ish NJ doctor with family and relationship issues). However, it is impossible not to like Dr. Marc Seidman. The book's plot is a bit convoluted--but not so crazy that you want to scream like Gone for Good (which oddly I still enjoyed). It was fun to see the return of Joe Pistillo, if even for a moment. The characters in here were nicely drawn. The themes of love, family, loss and the choices we resonate. It is good read and not an easy (as in neat and clean) end. Might be Coben's best to date."
5,no second chance,"Coben is as good a thriller writer is there is on the market today. TELL NO ONE kept me up all night. NO SECOND CHANCE did the same. In fact, have recommended it to friends that are not consummed with thrillers, or even reading, and they have forfeited ""manic Mondays"" at the office to finish. Can't wait until the next one!!!"
3,Snoozefest,"What a painfully boring book. After reading a lot of positive reviews about this book, I figured that I'd be in for a real treat. Wrong!Plastic surgeon Marc Seidman wakes up only to find himself lying on a hospital bed. His family life ended with two shots into his body and another into his wife Monica, leaving her as dead as Marc was supposed to be. He learns that his baby girl Tara has disappeared from his home as well. There's a ransom demand, and Monica's wealthy father is happy to pay the demand. Marc ignores Edgar's wishes and tips off the police and the FBI, and loses the money, any hope of recovering Tara. Eighteen months later, the kidnappers give Marc the second chance they swore they wouldn't: For another $2 million, they'll return Tara, whose hair samples they've already sent to her grandfather. This time Marc has a new ally, his college girlfriend Rachel Mills, a former FBI agent who just happens to have turned up."
3,"Okay, not what we were hoping for...","This book is good and if it didn't have to be compared to Tell No One and Gone for Good I might even say it was very good. However, Coben has raised his own bar and this just didn't make it in my book (no pun intended). It's worth reading, just not what I expected after the last two."
2,Not Nearly as Good as Coben's Others,This book simply does not compare to the other Coben books that I have read. The main character is annoying. How many times can one character make reference to the fact that he is a plastic surgeon? The ending is just bad.
5,Great stuff,"Coben is the master of the ""hook and twist,"" says his friend Dan Brown. Well, he got me again with this one. This one is not quite as good as ""Tell No One,"" but what is? This is a darn good thriller with twists and turns till the very end. Plus there is a nice happy ending. Great stuff."
2,Poor ending,I would not recommend this book if you've read 'Gone For Good'. They're both filled with twists and surprises that makes them thrilling and enjoyable. But the ending of this one is a disappointment. I felt that it's Coben's poor shot at trying to make the mystery unravel with a bang. It did not make sense.
3,Not his worst but spoiled by the ending,"This is Harlan's typical generic thriller - person goes missing, police are useless, bereaved father/husband recruits friends to help, last minute surprise plot twist etc. I actually enjoyed this more than 'Gone for Good' - it was fast paced and I was intrigued by how he would tie all the loose ends together. The characterisation as usual was weak - I never really felt the urgency of Marc's quest for his daughter, or his feelings for Rachel - but I kind of expected that. What lost the books a star was the truly horrible ending which was completely contrived and depended on a previously cool and rational character behaving in a completely irratic way. I'm sorry now that I stayed up late to finish it ..."
4,A great read!,"This book was my first Coben and from the beginning, I couldn't put it down. The way he starts out with a bang is great and involves the reader immediately. You don't have to suffer through 100 pages of background like in some Clancy books to get to the goods. His character development is wonderful, much like Patterson does in his Davenport novels. Pick this book up and you won't put it down until it's over."
3,No Second Chance,"This story starts out with a baby being kidnapped and her mother dying. There are too many ""twists and turns"" and too many evil characters involved in the kidnapping. It is very slow moving with a lot of ransom activities that only make the storyline boring and you have to skip pages hoping that it will get interesting again. This is the first book that I have read by this author and it will be the last. Mr. Coben could have cut out at least fifty pages of nonsense."
4,Entertaining,this book was a fast paced thriller with many twists and turns taht will keep u shifting on your chair until the last page!Coben did it again !I love his books !
3,Good read,I read Tell No One before this. I thought the other book to be a bit better but this is definitely a decent story.
1,Meandering and dull,"This book spends way too much time chasing its own tail. The writing is overly expository and bland with characters that don't act up to the things attributed to them. The premise was good, some of the plot points are good, No Second Chance just suffers from lack of passion both in the storyline and in characterization."
4,A worthy effort,"Coben creates brilliant plots, plots that are unpredictable, entertaining, and complex. The twists and turns cannot be anticipated. When the protagonist sustains a gunshot wound to the chest in the first paragraph and clings to life in a coma during the first 1/4 of the book, only a finely crafted bit of writing can cultivate interest and keep the reader focused."
3,Endless spinning,"I am not a big fan of thrillers. Thick, slowly unraveling procedurals or spy novels are my cup of tea. Even so, I read few of crazy, endlessly spinning books by Harlan Coben the master of this lowbrow genre.The trouble with thrillers is that you have to suspend or completely freeze your logic or thought process. They jump and jerk and leap, but it has absolutely nothing to do with reality.Mr. Coben writes quick, adrenaline pumping books, and he does it well.For that he has my respect if not my admiration."
4,Another Great Read From Master Storyteller,"There haven't been very many books that have made me experience so many emotions at once! This morning I opened this book, and 4 hours later I finished it. This book actually made me cry a couple of times! The main characters are as interesting as Myron Bolitar and friends, and the ending will shock as well as satisfy! Bravo!"
5,"Fast ""whodunit""","I'm very picky about my books, and not since Sydney Sheldon's early books have I found an author who has entertained me enough to call myself a loyal fan. I have a very busy life and it usually takes me at least three weeks to finish a book of this size and print, but I finished this one in five days. I found myself carrying it with me constantly - reading it at the airport, at stop lights (bad, I know), in doctor's offices - basiclaly any chance I could find. Its an absolute pageturner that leaves you dying to know who did it. Contrary to some of the other readers comments, I don't think Coben was desparate in the end to wrap it up. Instead, I think he knew from the beginning how and who would be the ""bad guy"" in the end - otherwise, how would I have figured out who did it seven chapters from the ending? Don't let me scare you though, I'm really good at solving mysteries. If you haven't bought it already - go get it!"
5,Excellent!,"It's a third book by Harlan Coben I've read and all of them are examples of great thrillers. This book together with 'Gone for good' and 'Tell No One' are very similar in a sense that all three are fast paced, have excellent (and what's very important, logical) plot, well developed characters, suspense, unexpected ending. I can't wait to read a next book by this writer."
5,Good read.,"I like the Coben books, and this one is just as good as the rest. Enjoyed it. Once you start reading, it is hard to put down."
2,Well-written but completely derails at the end,Coben can really write but that makes the disappointment all the worse when he runs off the rails at the end. Many authors can paint themselves into a corner with a complex plot; all you really ask for is a half-way reasonable explanation as they bring it home. No Second Chance ends on a cheap note when Coben changes a character completely just to wrap up the plot.
5,Can't Put This One Down,"This book is what we have come to expect from Harlan Coben - a mystery that wrenches in your guts, people you love unfortunately die, and just when you think you have the whole thing figured out he cuts a hard left that rolls you over into a new direction. I like these stand-alone novels a lot better than the Myron Bolitar series of books, and Coben is one of those authors who snares you pretty fast and has you thinking about the book even while you're not reading it. Well done, and I am looking forward to more!"
5,Great Cable,"I agree with the other reviewer's pros, but I haven't experienced his cons (my unit is labled directly - not with stickers, and after a couple of years of use I haven't managed to lose the 4-pin piece {though I don't think I've ever used it}). If you hate tangled masses of cables the way I do, this is great."
3,Was really looking for an upgrade,I too was looking for an upgrade. I was not able to import some data that was entered on a new edition of Family Tree Maker from a relative until I also got the newer edition.I am flabergasted that the company does not offer an upgrade over the internet for a lower price.This is my 2nd attempt to buy the software: I had ordered directly from the company. It never came. Amazon's price is lower for the identical product and includes free shipping. Hurray!!! Should've checked here first.
1,Didn't work for me,"The firewire ports would not work, but the USB did. Since I also received two FW/USB hard drive enclosures (1 with the hub and 1 replacement) with non-working FW, I chose to return all items and try another brand. I am a Mac person, and expected ""Mac""-ally products to be more reliable."
1,This thing stinks!!,"If you want a device to make your computer to freeze, and not startup, this is the device you are looking for! Oh and did I mention that some of my devices didn't even work on it? And it is UGLY! This is my first and last product from ""Macally""! Don't make the same mistake I did!"
3,Average,"The Guess who had some brilliant moments. A couple of them are here but as far as Guess Who albums go, this was very average."
3,great product terrible price,I have a 60 Gig that I absolutely love...that being said the price is too much. way too much. you can go to apple and get a 160 gig for $350.
2,Pricing Ripoff,"If you visit the Apple Store web site, they're selling the latest generation refurbished ""iPod Classic""(lastest generation, with video and pictures, and a nicer look) for $180, which has 80gigs.This refurbished ""iPod Video"" (previous generation with everything but a nicer look and less battery life) Amazon is selling at $200 for only 60gigs.Let me be clear with you; if you buy this iPod, you'll be paying for 20gigs LESS SPACE, for 20 MORE DOLLARS.Something is not adding up, eh?"
4,Were they sleeping when they typed in the price???!!!,What does Amazon think to price a refurb 60Gig Ipod for $599? Whay would anyone would ever want it at double the price of a new for a refurb. I hope it is a genuine mistake and they correct it. I guess it should be $199 for the refurb
3,Great performance from Jesse Bradford and Jordan ......,"This movie was a ok movie with excellent prefomance by Jesse and jordan,Jonathans preformance lacked interest, his character didnt need to be in the movie, this is the first movie where i didnt like his preformancethe only thing remotely gay in this film is the language nothing else so it lacked therethe romance or lack thereof with jesse and jordan kept you wanting more this is a must see movie however dont watch if the only reason is Jonathan he is ""hot"" but not in this movieif you want jonathan playing a gay character try ""Common Ground"" he did a absolute EXCELLENT preformance with that movie"
4,Well done !!,This film was well made and enjoyable. An excellent story and very well made. Gus has done it again. The acting was good and well timed lines worked powerfully. A good movie investment.
2,Typical outcome,"I wanted to like this movie. And I did like the actors and the technical aspects, but the story...the story is typical Hollywood.I always ask myself after seeing a movie, ""what have I gained by watching this movie?' I also asked myself ""what did the characters gain from living out the story in the movie?""My answer to both questions is pretty much the same. Johnny, the boy who wants to be a racecar driver, would have been better off if he never stopped in Las Vegas. Johnny makes it to North Carolina despite the people and experiences of Las Vegas...and that's a miracle. I'm all for new and unusual experiences, but this movie and it's story is best viewed once and forgotten."
2,Typical inane movie that barely entertains,"Skip this movie if you're looking for characters with depth and a film that doesn't delve into the stereotypical ""young kids hate older guys"" kind of fare. So much of this movie grated me I found it tough to watch the whole thing. The fact that the ending is predictable doesn't help redeem it in the end. This movie accomplishes nothing and only gets 2 stars because the dialogue between the gay and straight guy was fairly believable. Other than this, this is a can miss."
2,What? Huh? I didn't get it...,"I didn't get this movie. I didn't feel that the characters were very well defined, they seemed two dimensional at best. I wouldn't recommend this and I am sorry that I spent my money and time."
3,Jonathan Taylor Thomas,"Being a big fan of Jonathan,I was kind of dissapointed to see so little of him in this movie. But it was cool seeing him as ""a not so nice guy"" Probably helps being gay when you watch this movie. It is a SAD love story. Left me in tears."
1,Skirting the issue,"This is so typical of American film making. Giving the viewer a glimpse into a really horrid world, and then glossing over the subject. Please please if you are the least bit interested in this subject, look at Mandragora instead. I can imagine a teenager looking at this film and thinking its okay to go on the streets, but the reality is so far away.The acting and film making attributes were extremely good, but skirting the issue makes it a flop. My private Idaho was better, but bite the bullet and get Mandragora."
3,why,this is what you think it is not you have a movie that just makes you want to shut it off every five seconds
2,Misses it's mark by a longshot.......,"This movie is not that good. There are plenty of reviews that describe perfectly where this movie fails and where it succeeds.Unfortunately; it fails more often than not.There are good performances mixed with bad performances- cliches mixed with some truth- and a weak script with a few high points.Overall, the film just isn't edgy or honest enough. The characters and performances (with the exception of Jordon Brower) just arent fleshed out realistically ...and others are just downright annoying.One review states that this movie should be watched with the directors commentary on. I think I may give that a try....since I've already suffered through the film itself.For everyone else out considering this movie....""SpeedWay Junkie"" is worth passing on more than it is worth watching."
4,Coming of age in paradise.,"I found this book challenged my senses more than Blu's Hanging in that the rawness of the discriptions against Hawai'i's beautiful back drop was a roller coaster. I understood Wyatt although all men would rather be Maverick, the in your face dark side of Wyatt holds you. Toni is captured perfectly as the potentialy good daughter who does all the things that a parent hopes thier daughter doesn't do, but she comes out of it bruised yet on her feet. I now know what's behind kalua pig and why it's such a big part of Hawaiiain cuisine. The characters were all fantastic. Mahalo."
4,Heartwrenching yet wonderful portrayl of local life in Hilo,"Heads by Harry made me cry with homesickness for the beautiful Big Island, ""local kine"" food and the sound of pidgin English. The characters, from Toni, whom the story revolves around, to haole-hating Wyatt and the mahu Shelly - all are so real, so like Hawaii. Thank you Ms Yamanaka for presenting life in Hawaii in such an earthy, moving and realistic way."
3,Peaches and Herb sound better,"I bought this CD for their version of ""Love is Strange"" that I remember from decades ago and was in the movie ""Dirty Dancing"". The CD contains a number of songs that were not hits at the time of original release. I have a classic Peaches and Herb CD that I like better."
5,Living -- And Lively -- History,"""Parade"" is a musically sophisticated, stylistically varied piece of musical theater. At its simplest level, it has memorable tunes and clever lyrics; at a deeper level, it is a thoughtful examination of prejudice and hypocrisy that encouraged me to research Leo Frank's life."
5,"Fantastic Score, Fantastic Show","Parade did not deserve to close as soon as it did. Fortunately, RCA has released an incredibly well-produced cast recording that really captures the depth and complexity of the show. Buy it NOW. You won't regret it."
5,Absolutely Incredible!!!!,"I recently purchased the recording of PARADE, and several listens later, came to the conclusion, that if there is any justice at all in this world, Jason Robert Brown will win the Tony Award for Best New Musical Score! It is an incredibly powerful score, full of emotion and depth. What a far cry from what Broadway has been subjected to so far this year! I became a huge fan of the composer, Jason Robert Brown, after hearing his score for, SONGS FOR A NEW WORLD. PARADE made me conclude, that he is definitely musical theater's best hope for shows that contain sweeping scores and insightful lyrics. If you haven't purchased this yet - what are you waiting for!!!Best Wishes, Steven"
3,I wanted to love this.,"I really do want to love this musical. I got the CD when I found out that my College was doing it. I soon became hooked on the show...but only because of about 4 songs that were amazingly addictive to me.The show's wonderful but can be lyrically week at times and never draws a musical theme out long enough for the listener to grow close to it.Numbers like, ""The Old Red Hills of Home"", and ""The Factory Girls"" are inspired and gorgeously written. But then the show drops the ball. When listening to this show I have to hit the skip button way too many times. This, however, does not diminish my appreciation for how wonderfully sculpted Brown's music is. He is going to be stunning in years to come.I also agreed with some points made by previous reviews regarding staging. This show smacks of ""Ragtime"" in its choreography and relies too heavily on the charisma of the performers and not enough on the pure craft of its musicallity."
4,An old show for a new Broadway,"I cannot believe that a show as beautiful, moving and gripping as Parade would close so quickly. The failure of such a show causes me to wonder about today's audiences. Would they much rather see a show about dancing cats than about human characters with human problems? I think Parade will forever be one of those wonderful colt shows that can only be appreciated by those with good taste."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"It was tough for me to find the cast recording for Parade. It seemed no place here in southern california had the CD. I finally found it, and boy am glad I did. It is amazing. Brent Carver is wonderful as it Carolee Carmello. The whole ensemble is great too and I love the whole court room section of the CD. I am glad I found this recording and it ranks right behind Ragtime for my favorite cast recording. Hopefully Parade will win every major award it is up for, including the Tony."
5,Better on CD than in the Vivian Beaumont,"I was one of the many fans who saw ""Parade"" and was ""underwhelmed"" by the score during and after the show. Perhaps, I was so caught up in the performances and Prince's brilliant staging that I just didn't pay enough attention to the music. I LOVE the recording, especially ""All the Wasted Days"" and the opening number. It still ranks behind ""Ragtime"" (a CD I will NEVER tire of listening to) in my book, but that's a pretty big show/score to have to surpass. Carolee Carmello is beyond superb!! I hope it racks up at the Tonys."
1,"Sorry folks, but I didn't like it","Despite all these really enthusiastic reviews by other listeners, I have to admit: I hate Parade! Sorry folks, but that Dixie sound gets on my nerves, really. But I have to admit that I am not quite fond of Sondheim, mentioned by some of you, either. I prefer this classic style like Les Mis etc. or music out of the pop sector (I loved 'A new brain'!)."
1,dull dull dull,"the only thing more painful then listening to this tedious score, was actually sitting in the beaumont. seeing a photo of leo frank had more impact than the two and a half hours spent in the theater. five minutes after seeing it i couldn't recall one note. i think if something is perceived as noble it is said to great. the nasty little secret about this show is that people really didn't like it."
5,A MASTERPIECE,"PARADE is the essence of all that musical theater can offer. Jason Robert Brown, I've said it many times over, you are a genious. PARADE is just one of those pieces that digs into your soul each and every time you listen to it. The story line is amazing, as it is also very real, and the score that Brown has so generously written turns it into something more. PARADE is brilliant all the way around. I can only hope that Jason Robert Brown will soon put out his newest creation! The future of Broadway theater is right here. This is it! PARADE is a masterpiece and should be taken in by all. BUY THE FUTURE OF BROADWAY AND TAKE IT TO HEART. PARADE IS AMAZING!"
3,"It's Okay, But...","Being somewhat familiar with the story and also liking Carolee Carmello, I anticipated hearing the CD. I was a bit disappointed. None of the songs really stuck with me except ""The Picture Show."" That said, I do plan to see the show when it comes to Green Bay. Perhaps my attitude may change after seeing the show, but, if you have not seen the show, I would not recommend the CD at this time."
4,a GRAND Parade,"Hooray for Jason Robert Brown...an intelligent, witty, moving, memorable score on Broadway? And it isn't by Sondheim? I would have thought it impossible...but THIS is a keeper; superb renditions of wonderful songs! ""Rumblin' and a Rollin'"" is probably not on the same par with the others, but I just want to cry sometimes when I listen to ""All the Wasted Time"". Wonderful liner notes, as well."
5,An American Masterpiece,"Don't believe the critics. If you pass this cd up you are missing out on an amazing musical experince. I bought it yesterday and, haven't turned it off. I totaly fell in love with the song ""It Isn't Over Yet."" It is such a moving song. I listened to it over, and over. Carolee Carmello moves me to tears when she sings ""DO IT ALONE"" When you combine the two you get songs like, ""ALL THE WASTED TIME."" This is the first musical since RAGTIME that kepy me listening for hours. If you are a true die hard theatre fan, you must buy this magnificent work of art. Jason Robert Brown is the next Sondheim/Gershwin of our time. I have a feeling that this musical will be back on Broadway soon!"
5,Wow! So incrediblely amazingly fastastic!!,"Considering Parade was the only new musical to open that wastechnically a musical and written directly for the theater, I boughtthis a month after the release (because I couldn't find it!) and had to get used to it first, but after I did...WOW! It's hauntingly gorgeous. Parade is an awesome musical which will not be forgotten! However, I fear Civil War will, as will ""Blues"".BUY THIS CD!!!!"
5,Magnificent,"If you have to choose between either Parade and another Les Miserables Cast Recording, Parade is the only way to go. This is quite simply one of the greatest examples of musical, and lyrical work that the Great White Way has ever seen. Parade is a tribute to America. An illustration of the darkest shades of our Nation and a portrait of our brightest colors. The actors give you their souls and voices. The musicians must have sold their souls to the Devil to play such beautiful music and Jason Robert Brown is the new Sondheim. Expect great things!"
4,"A well-produced recording, but beware the potato chip score.","You simply can't listen to Parade once. It's that simple. The score is excellent, but it's very complex, and most of it isn't the traditional Broadway milieu. If that bothers you, don't bother with the disk. A ""post-modern"" musical of sorts, Parade has lots of very dark subject matter, with a modern and unique score to match. Each performance--particularly Carolee Carmello--is excellent, so you will probably want to come back for more. But unless you're willing to be challenged by the music and the story, this is certainly not a recording for you."
5,"""The"" Beau Brummels","Play it to death, in the car and at home.Smooth, would only scratch the surface of this group. Listened to the lp many years ago, and was very pleased to see that the album had made the transition to cd. Sal is a ""crooner""? Yes! And, the rest of the group only enhances his vocals. The little bit of instrumentals only highlight the professionalism and talent of these guys;a good sound system will really show them off..."
2,Very Disappointing CD From A Usually Great Artist,"I am a big fan of Omar Faruk Tekbilek. His recording with Brian Keane 'Beyond The Sky'is the finest Middle Eastern instrumental recording ever made that I am aware of. After so many great CDs like 'FireDance',' Beyond The Sky',' Mystical Garden', and 'Crescent Moon', this CD is a major let down. 'One Truth' just doesn't possess nearly the musicianship, passion, or even recording quality of his earlier releases. I hope that Omar Faruk can rebound from this, his very worst record, and return to making the incredible genre standard setting recordings that he has made in the past. I would advise anybody considering buying this CD to spend your money more wisely on any of his other earlier CDs."
5,Meditations on the Ottoman Empire,"Omar Faruk Tekbilek is a talented, virtuoso artist who has made a transition from playing Oriental themed bellydance to more traditional Sufi music and classical Turkish traditions. This album continues that journey, highlighting the beauty and grandeur of the former Ottoman Empire. The haunting melodies and driving percussions on tracks like 'I Love You,' 'Tahir Raks,' 'Roman,' and 'Ara'ya' call to mind the ancient city of Istanbul, while 'Red Skies,' which features Flamenco guitarist Adam Del Monte, drifts further west into the golden age of al-Andalus. Over all, this is excellent atmospheric music, very firmly rooted in the traditional culture of Anatolia. If you want an accessible introduction to Ottoman Turkish music, Omar Faruk Tekbilek is a great name to start with. This album, 'Suleyman the Magnificent,' 'Fire Dance' and/or 'Alif: Love Supreme' are all great CDs well worth adding to your collection."
5,Excellent dance music,"I am a belly dancer, and I found this CD to be an excellent source for dancing music (both for practice and performance); it is also wonderful to listen to. Omar Farouk is an outstanding musician, and his talent really shows on this CD."
2,The Truth is....,"This is a substantial disapointment for Omar Faruk Tekbilek's fans.Tekbilek is a great musician who has made some amazing albums, this just isn't one of them."
2,A good CD but too many lyrics,"With no doubt, Omar is one of the best musician for the true middle eastern music. He makes music that is so wonderful to anyone to listen regardless from what region in the world the listener from. Unfortunately, this CD contains too many songs with lyrics. I enjoy the sound of relaxing and touching music, but when I hear lyrics that I don't understand, I try to ignore or just skip it. This CD I ended up listening to one piece only over and over ""One Truth"". It does have lyric, but in English and it is worth buying the CD. Other songs are ok."
4,"as,described, worked good","no problem with quality, worked ok for what i needed. used to connect my pc to my plasma tv."
4,We don't need no stinking monsters,"Bought this item for the occasional viewing of TV downloads from my conputer. Also use from the desktop to moniter. Does exactly what I need for about $200 less than the name brand. When viewing on the TV (50"" LCD HDTV), just unplug from monitor and into the side of the TV from computer center over the TV on the wall. Well worth the cost."
3,They were good... for awhile,"I purchased this hdmi cable a while ago. They worked very well for awhile, but after about 6 months the wire broke right at the head. They still worked for a while while it was broken but the picture started to cut in and out, had to get another one eventually."
2,OK when it works...,I purchased 2 of these cables. One worked briefly then stopped working and the other seems to work fine. I can only guess that the one that broke had a wire inside the cable that broke shortly after un-coiling the cable. 50% success rate is not too good. now I have to deal with the hassle of returning one.
1,Low Quality,"Like another reviewer, the cable I received was 25' not 30'. In addition, the cable was nothing but trouble right from the beginning. Had poor connectivity and frequent disruptions. This cable is half the thickness (read cheap) compared to a 30' cables unlimited pro cable that we used to connect the receiver to the projector. This cable was intended to connect an extra HDMI input to the receiver (very infrequent). It has now died completely after about 8 months of negligible use. The Cables Unlimited cable (30') has had no glitch by comparison after 1 year of heavy use. In hindsight it was not worth skimping on the $30-40."
1,Don't order cord from Eforcity!,"Ordered this product through Amazon from Eforcity. They sent a 25 ft cord instead of the described 30 ft cord. 25 ft is not long enough for my application. I emailed Eforcity about two weeks ago using the link provided by Amazon and have received no response.Works fine, but it is not 30 ft long!"
2,25 foot hdmi cable,The hdmi cable I received did not work when I hooked it up from my blue ray player to my projector please send me one that will work thank you s.h.
1,didn't work,"This cable would not work between my computer and asus monitor. It did somewhat work between a powered hdmi splitter and the monitor, but the screen was full of green artifacts."
4,"GBA rocks, but I would prefer Nintendo DS","Gameboy Advance is pretty good. Ive had mine for about 2-3 years. Ill write some Pros and Cons about it.Pros:Great GamesOkay GraphicsPretty SmallNice ColorNice SoundMultiplayerFunCons:You have to buy a light for it if you play in the darkFor multiplayer games you have to buy a cordGames I prefer:Pokemon Ruby,Saphire and Emerald.So,this system is pretty good but if you have the money, you should really look at the Nintendo DS."
2,Great but bad,"I would give this game a perfect 5 but I'm amazed at how dark the screen is! When I first turned it on I could barely see anything. I had to sit next to a bright light and awkwardly hold it up. This is a MAJOR flaw. No matter how good the game is it will never live up to it's full potential thank to the GBA's poor lighting. That aside, the GBA's graphics are amazing after playing the old Game Boy. The Super Nintendo graphics are still welcome in the hands of gamers and the audio is surprising good. The screen size should be bigger but with color and great graphics the picture is still easy to see. That is, if you've got a bright light to sit next to."
3,"Great, except one big strike against it.","The new GBA is fantastic except for one glaring fault -- the LCD screen is not backlit. This makes it difficult to see what's going on. Even if you get a light to attach to it, it's still not the perfect solution because it reflects off the screen -- so you have one too-bright circle on your screen and the rest is still in the dark. So far it seems like playing in full sunlight gives the best light, but even then you still get some glare off the screen. It's a really annoying problem that could have easily been taken care of if Nintendo had just backlit the screen. There are some backlit kits you can buy yourself, such as Afterburner, but for most people, opening up the GBA and trying to solder stuff together is not an option. It also voids your warranty. If you want a backlit screen, you can find places online that sell GBAs with backlit kits already installed."
4,The original GBA was a good start.,"Now we have the GBA SP, with a light built in that is much superior. Fuchsia was an interesting choice for Nintendo, in which to produce a system. No little boy wanted the Fuchsia one, and the little girls were hesitant as well. However, when all the other colors were bought out, this was an attractive option to the kids who wanted a GBA right then.It's not a bad color, and some people love pink. Buy this for those people. Other then that, buy a GBA SP to save yourself money on accessories i.e. a light and batteries."
4,Not So Many Great Games,Although Game Boy advance is fun you can't get that many great games (this is from a girls perspective). I can't find any games that I like besides Tetras.
5,GBA in fuschia,"ooooo! i love GBA! it is so cool. if u buy it, u should buy mario kart super circuit! i love that game! this is a great present for a loved one :) i love pink!"
4,Great! Good Investment!,"Neat gadget for everyone whose a gamer! I just bought mine today from Toys ""R"" Us and know without question I'll be playing with this thing for years! The only thing you have to get use to, if your like me, is the small screen. Other than that it's great! Buy one."
3,Didn't look new,"The description said it was a ""new"" product without original packagaing. When it arrived, it looked very old, the box was crushed and the tape was ""yellow"" looking like it has been on someone's shelf for a very long time. It is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and I am going to attach the packing slip showing ""this product is new"" because otherwise she will think it's a used game boy advance. Would have returned it, but didn't want to go through the trouble of paying for shipping."
4,A nice view of the Romulan Empire,"I got this book a week ago, and I must say that this view of the Empire is fantastic. The depth of details is awesome. I like the military setting in particular. The whole conception of a militarized society, living for a common dream: reaching D'era (the Endless Sky) as the goal set from Vulcan times and fulfilled since the diaspora.The art is somewhat lacking, but it's heavily compensated with the adventures and the detail in Romulan character creation, rounded up as any Starfleet officer."
5,"""I hear voices.""","Words of Jerry Goldsmith while writing the score, and the perfect thought it was. This is my second Goldsmith score after The Secret of N.I.M.H. It took me a while to get this soundtrack, but after seeing the movie four times then I couldn't resist. My favorite tracks are 3, 5, 8, and 10. There the ones with the most tension in the music. I was dissapointed about one thing though. The soundtrack didn't have the music of when Damien flips out just from the sight of the church. That music was one of the best parts in the film. A soundtrack I'm also trying to get by Jerry is Psycho II, but it's impossible to find. Jerry makes some of the best horror music ever. It's sad that he hasn't gotten more academy awards instead of just one for this score. Lionel Newman brings out all the tempoes just right in the music that it almost sounds like Jerry is conducting. I hope someday they give a full version of the score."
2,2 stars for 2 Good tracks,"Track 1, ""Ave Satani"", and Track 12, ""The Altar"", are the highlights of this soundtrack. Everything else in between is either too mellow, or too much out of sync. Jerry Goldsmith (finally) won a music award for this soundtrack, but it must have been based soley on track 1 & 12, which seem to be the most recognizable tracks that I recall from the actual film. The tracks where there is choral voices seems to not blend in. There are male and female voices that while performing, just don't follow each other's pattern, and that takes away from the threatening, scary atmosphere that the music is trying to relay. Listening to this CD with headphones is a must! Although I'm a tad disapointed with the CD in it's entirety, I'm glad that I own it. There's also a nice little biography on Jerry Goldsmith printed on the inside of the CD jacket."
5,Loved this book!,"I loved this book and every other book in this series. I could not put this book down - it was the same with all the McRae books. I really liked Zach and Julie and how they each had demons to battle, but were there to help each other out through all their messes. It was really a sweet love story! Would definitely recommend this whole series!"
5,Bed of Lies,I've really been enjoying this series. Want to keep following it. This book really explored howto learn to trust someone's love would stay.
3,Technically giving this 2 1/2 stars,"Ok. So in comparison to some pretty badly written books I have read (freebies) this book was much better but compared to her previous two books in the series it was badly executed. I get that both H/h were not perfect and were dealing with emotional drama that affected them greatly but, man, it just dragged on and on. There was way too much internal dialogue with themselves and not enough interaction with each other. The weaving of the tale of how and why the fell for each other is not there. There was one incident that resulted in them sleeping with each other. They felt a connection but there is no development or exploration as to why. Next thing we know they are in love and fighting their inner demons to be worthy of each other but of course all we read about is how they think about this over and over. Ugh long story short the book was boring. A far cry from the emotional roller coaster of the first two books and angsty love story of Emma and Rye."
4,Loved it!,This book was as good as all the other ones but when I read the reviews for Five days Grace I was a little disappointed they weren't more intertwined.
2,not worth it,"this toy is not worth it there isnt much to do, the music is annoying and some stuff she cant even do its to hard"
4,"good toy, ridiculous price","nice toy that has two sides for entertainment, plus can be attached to crib or just played with on the floor. however amazon is taking advantage of the fact that there are no activity centers available for the crib out there except this one. they have it marked up to a ridiculous amount...it would be nice if other companies would make activity centers once again. generations of children grew up with them in their cribs and actually learned how to entertain themselves there"
3,Good but not great,"I'm giving this 3 stars because I bought it as a crib toy and it doesn't attach to the crib rail securely. My baby kicked it off once and I had to tie it on so it didn't happen again. I do love that it has an ""off"" switch for the music ... that is the best feature by far!"
1,choking potential,"I would not recommend this toy. My 10 month old son was able to break off one of the 4 knobs on the bottom of the toy. I found the piece clenched in his hand while he was asleep, we are very fortunate he didn't put it in his mouth. These knobs when broken off are a choking hazard."
2,Dangerous Crib Toy,"My daughter is 10 months. This toy is in her crib and she often kicks on the music with her feet. Today when she kicked it, the toy fell on her. It is a heavy toy that only hangs on the crib with plastic hangers. I would recommend the toy for floor play but not for the crib! Needless to say, this is no longer in her crib!"
2,Disapointed and too expensive,"I bought this for my daughter at 3mo and now she is 11 mo and she has barely played w/ it. My baby bumps into it constantlywhile in the crib and like another review said, the pull bell is too hard for her to pull and the squeeky button is too hard to push. Also, the music feature has never worked right. It sounds like the batteries need to be replaced when I have installed new batteries. I feel that this toy is too expensive also. I mainly bought it b/c it is attractive w/ its bright colors( she liked looking at it when i first showed it to her but never really held her attention for to long)and i thought the 2 sided feature would be a plus BUT do not waste your money...."
5,Exactly what I was wanting!,I purchased this for my nephew but my 3year old had a blast playing with it as well. I haven't given it to him yet but there is plenty for him to keep him occupied so that his mama won't have to rush to his crib after he awakes from his nap (both sides have things to play with). It's exactly what I was wanting!
4,Very nice toy!,Our 3 month old son loves this toy. He hits it real hard and looks at what he's done. It is a cause and effect toy. Would highly recommend it to others. It is lots of fun to play with it.
1,hazardous!,"I thought this was the best toy - my kid loved it and it kept her entertained - BUT - today I found her holding one of the loops from the toy which is attached to a long, thin piece of plastic (about 4 inches long) - not only could this have choked her but she could have stuck it in her eye, nose, etc. The toy is still somewhat functional but now I worry about the construction of the rest of it so it's going in the trash. I expected better from this company and from the price of it but it seems everything now is made cheaply. Judging from the other reviews it looks like this should be recalled."
4,"Tiny Love Toy not unique, but holds attention","As a first toy in a baby's crib, this is a good attention getter. The small handles allow an infant of only 3 monts the opportunity to grab and make a first cause and effect relationship. As the child grows, so does the range of activities he'll enjoy with this product."
2,"OK toy, some problems","There is some great activities on this toy, but there were problems on both sides. On the first side, the only way to get the face to light up and play music is to press hard, and hold the face for a second--what infant does that? Also the squeaky thing is hard for even me to press. My 8 month old liked the spinning flower though, if it is the only toy around.On the older side there are much better activities. He is enjoying those more, but the pop-up feature won't work. It does not stay closed. If I do get it to close, just touch it and it pops up--you are supposed to learn to press the button. I found this toy in a local baby store after buying it, and 8 of 10 had the same problem. I haven't seen a better crib activity center, so we are still keeping it (mostly because I am not a returning type)."
1,Take A Pass!!,After reading the reviews here I thought the Activity Center would be a great item to register for. I could not have been more disappointed. The first problem was that it didn't work. Fortunately the store allowed me to exchange it. The next problem was finding one in the store that worked. I had to try 8 out if 9 of them before finding one that actually worked. Don't waste you money on this...keep looking for something else. I finally purchased the Ocean Wonders Aquarium by Fisher-Price and couldn't be more pleased!
2,Be Careful!,"I used to let my son play with this toy in his crib. One day after his nap, I went into his room and saw that he had ripped the squishy ball off the toy. It was laying on the floor next to his crib. I'm just thankful he didn't put it in his mouth. I have contacted the company and the CPSC about it."
3,My daughter likes this when it's not in her crib,The gadgets are neat.It's very colorful. The music is horrible. I purchased this for night time entertainment while my daughter is awake in her crib....so my husband and I can sleep. Well-- She is only interested in playing with it outside of the crib. I would not recommend this product.
2,Wasted Money,I too live in Europe and paid 80 euro for a toy that my son glanced at for a second but has yet to even touch it. I've tried to inspire him but he is uninterested. I hope side two might be better but I'm not sure. My son is 6 months and when he goes to his Grandma's she has a very old Fisher Price activity center that he loves.
4,Not a bad toy,"I bought this for my 7 month and it is a pretty nice activity center with lots of different knobs and switches that babies like. I like the idea of two different sides of play. The only problem I have with this is that I have trouble hanging it from crib, it really isn't designed to hang from the side of crib, just too bulky. Overall a pretty neat baby toy that my son can grow with."
3,Baby bangs into toy....,"First off this toy is great if.... your crib is set up so your baby can reach it (especially if he isn't sitting up), second, if your baby doesn't mind banging into to it all the time. The toy is heavy duty plastic, I thought it would be padded or rubber.Other than that...it is graphically stimulating and has enough on it to keep the baby interested, however I've removed mine from the crib and plan to revisit this toy on the floor with the red legs on.Citychick to a 6.5 month old."
5,Happy Morning Baby,I have twins and purchased this crib toy for my early riser. He loves to sit in his crib and happily plays until brother wakes up. Its been wonderful to keep him busy and happy so everyone else can catch a few more z's.
1,Forget it if you run XP,It doesn't run on windows xp. I tried it on windows 98 and it wouldn't run because my processor was too slow on that laptop. Be sure to look at requirements and make sure it matches up or you'll be wasting your money.Randy T.
3,"Great Game, but only if you have Windows 98","My kids loved this game. It was amazing to hear my 6 year old making comments about topics such as potential vs kinetic energy. These were not just buzz words, he really seemed to understand the concepts. He learned a lot at an early age and had lots of fun. In the game, you go thru an entertaining tutorial on a topic, then answer a few questions. For each correct answer, you get a part for the pinball machine. The parts do funny things that make the kids laugh. Once you have enough parts, you build the pinball game onscreen by placing the pieces. Then you get to play pinball. Lots of fun. Unfortunately, it will not run on any other version of Windows, just Windows 98. I tried Windows 98 compatability mode on Windows XP, but no luck. I even built a Windows 98 virtual machine (using VMware), but it would fail to recognize some of the required hardware (CD or sound card, I forget which)."
4,Gloria Lynne is an excellent live singer,"Uh well, I just wanted to point out that Gloria Lynne is great live, at least based on this album-pair. Her voice sounds great, and is filled with a sort of optimism...the album is very upbeat, not my favorite Gloria necessarily, but definitely worth having, and she owns ""Fly me to the moon""."
1,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"This product did not work for me and when I got in touch with the customer service, they are not ready to help.If you really want this product, same model; I suggest that you buy it elsewhere because if you buy it from this seller and by any chance the product is defective, they will NOT accept returns or give you any refund OR EVEN EXCHANGE IT!!!( I was ready to pay a little extra for better quality but I was obviously wrong )It was a complete waste of money and besides, this product is more expensive than many other very good ones in the market!Their policy is ""once you have used it, we do not take it back"" !!!!If the buyer does not try to use it, how will she know if it works fine or not??? !!!! BEWARE!LOL"
3,piece of junk,"Sounds a little rickety and rattling right out of the dirty box... I expect it to break soon, as most of these hot air contraptions do... Sounds like there is something in the fan..."
2,Mostly old and out of date images but some decent as well,Images of people and computers are really dated. Forget using any of the technology related images unless you want to picture stuff thats over 6 years old. If you need basic images of flowers and animals this CD will work for you.
5,Great filters and GREAT sellers!,"It's wonderful news when both the product AND the sellers are ""tops"" in their field of work. (Not to mention the great price!) :-)These filters work great on our Lennox AC. And we've tried several! What I liked about this seller is: when our order arrived in a torn box/ was damaged during shipping, these people went ""ABOVE AND BEYOND"" to make things right for us. They were also courteous and quick. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
5,Terry Dolan's Hiberno-English,"This is a pioneering work which belongs on the shelf of any linguist, any student of Ireland, and anyone interested in gaining a knowledge of 'Irishness'. It is an invaluable source of knowledge and renders important insights into the state of the English language in Ireland. English, as Joyce described it, is both 'familiar and foreign' to Ireland; Terry Dolan's work demonstrates how the Irish have made what was once a colonial imposition a tool for their own use. This is a fascinating, detailed and original project, I recommend it with great enthusiasm."
5,A great resource,"Since I bought the book, I've found myself looking up one expression or other again and again. I've used it much more often than I expected, and I've found it to be a great resource. I had no idea how many differences there are between American English and the English spoken in Ireland! Many words from the Irish language found their way into American English, but even more (understandably) became part of the English spoken in Ireland.The definitions, or explanations, include a fine range of examples of how the term as used by speakers in different parts of Ireland (city and countryside), and the term as it is found in works of literature and drama by Irish authors. The definitions also give, briefly, the word's source (often from Irish). I would recommend it to anyone with interest in Hiberno-English, or who is reading plays or novels by Irish authors (in English). Might be very handy for a visitor to Ireland, too!"
3,Current Catholic Reading,"This book is heavy reading. Having been involved in teaching Catholic faith for over 10 years, it's something I value. However, there is a lot of information to digest and it has to be read carefully. I shared it with my education committee and most of them did not like to read it and therefore didn't. This is for the serious educator and is read easier in a like group who can discuss it."
2,Dense Book; Better Resources Online,"This review is coming from the President and CEO of CatechismClass.com. We are an online company that strives to provide catechism resources to parishes, families, schools, etc. I read this book thinking to may help me better promote my products but this book was not helpful for that purpose. I did not feel that it contained practical information. After reading this book, I will not be making any changes to the online, interactive catechism programs that my organization provides."
2,Go for the Taragon piece,"This CD basically contains the ""I Will Follow Him"" album with six ""bonus"" tracks among which are the remaining three top-100 singles achieved by March. With the bonus singles thrown in, it stretches to a ""greatest hits"" collection.These album tracks are in stereo and good, not great, sound. The bonus tracks however, were apparently thrown on from whatever inferior source that may have been laying around the BMG vaults. They are not in stereo and not the quality they should be for a CD reissue.This leads to the fact that these other tracks are available on Taragon's ""Very Best of"" compilation with its vastly superior sound. If you must have the entire ""Follow"" album, then this is your only choice. If you want a more comprehensive, far better-sounding compilation of March's RCA work, go for the Taragon piece."
3,I Will Follow Him,"Although Peggy March has been one of my favorite artist for several years, this CD hardly showcases her unique talents. It is a compilation of her first album. It is a good example of how producers Hugo Peretti and Luigi Creatore stifled this artist's tremendous ability (Probably one of the leading contributors of Peggy's inability to get firmly established in the USA). Despite this she manages to make several of these tunes quite enjoyable. If you would like to hear Peggy at her best try her 1968 album No Foolin' or listen to her German work. If you like oldies try Tarragon's The Very Best of Little Peggy March. It has some of Peggy's better English RCA recordings."
5,True Stereo and Great Sound Quality,"This CD contains all songs found on the original 1963 RCA album of the same title. There are several catchy songs by Peggy March using her unique high pitched cute voice. If you liked ""I Will Follow Him"", then you will like the other songs on this CD. All songs originally contained on the album are in true stereo on this CD. Sound quality is good enough to have come from the original master tapes, although there is no mention of this on the CD. Only the six bonus tracks are in mono. I searched many years to find a mint condition stero copy of the original album. I don't have to look any more."
5,Great Music From The Past,I am so elated that I ordered this CD. I remember all the songs especially the onethat struck a chord with me. MEXICO. I was around 8 years old when this song wasplaying on the radio. What childhood memories I have. I listen to the CD all thetime in my car. Great choice of songs.
5,"Bob Moore ""Mexico""","The first L.P. I ever bought was Bob Moore's ""Mexico"" That was a while back. Well a little. With moving House a few times since then it kind of got lost. I decided it was about time to treat myself and replace it so was real pleased to find this C.D.. Having bought it I am certainly not disappointed. Great to hear Bob Moore's music again after so long, and great quality. Just enjoying it.Mexico"
4,"Beautiful orchestra sounds, no words.","Inside cover has adorable original liner notes from both musicals. Begins ""Camelot, the fabulous new musical..."" Did expect words as well as music, now I'll have to buy another CD before I see the show next week."
3,"OK, not the greatest.",My 2 year old was kind of bored by this. It's obviously a bunch of snippets from Kermit on Sesame Street. It seemed kind of dated.
4,star on the rise,"IF YOU ARE A FAN OF BLUES/ROCK AND SOUL THIS CD AS IT ALL AND IT IS ALL GOOD. GRADY SOUNDS LIKE A YOUNG ROBERT JOHNSON WITH HIS SOUND POWERFUL VOICE. BEST CUTS ARE ""DONT START ME TALKNG"" OLD SONNY BOY WILLIAMSON SONG ABD ""SOME KIND OF WONDEFUL"" OLD GRAND FUNK TUNE. THE MOST POWERFUL SONG IS ""GOIN DOWN SLOW"" WHICH STRESSES THE CONSENQUENCES OF UNPROTECTED SEX. GRADY SINGS AND PLAYS HARMONICA."
3,good music but who told the guy he could sing?,"Grady Champion was a new name to me, having bought the CD on the basis of an Amazon recommendation. The album has it's moments and the music's great but when it comes to singing, Grady should stick to playing the harmonica."
3,Not for those in the throes of major depression,"This is a book with some good lifestyle ideas, and could definitely be helpful in helping those who go in and out of depression to maintain a healthy lifestyle that could keep that next episode at bay.However, I would say that this book isn't much help for those who are severely clinically depressed.Read this book after you're out of a depressive episode. It won't do much good before."
5,a great collection from a guy who makes real good music,Gary Puckett makes really great music. Some of his songs are so enjoyable even after so many years. Not too many performers like him these days.This is a great selection of his best songs.
3,Something's missing,"Very quickly .... How can you a Greatest Hits or ""the best of"" without the song ""Home"" get real..."
5,This thing is great!,"It holds all the tools I own! (not that I have that many...) This has so many pockets I didn't have enough tools to fill it. If you are looking for something to organize your tools and keep them all in the same place, this is the ticket!"
3,Good to sit on a shelf but really that much fun? Maybe.,If you are a collector and want a good addition to your spiderman set then this one is really good for you. I told my 5 year old son to pick one toy at [local store] the other day and this is the one he picked. He got it home showed it to his friends and it has since been running in my feet ever since due to it laying on the floor. If he plays with it it's when I'm not looking but he does like it. Good toy but not great.
3,not very good,this toy is not very good. the arm broke off a week after i got it. and then my daddy glued it for me but then it broke again! it doesn't pose in very many places.
3,"Nothing big, really","All this is is a bunch of their songs from Firme in Spanish instead of English as well as a few other ones that were Spanish to start out with, and El Coo Cooi in English. It's got two new songs in Spanish too. Not really worth spending a lot of cash on but if you're a big fan it's nice to have. I hope this isn't classified as their new album, though."
3,Don't have $600? Here are most of the songs...,1. Song To the Siren - Tim Buckley2. Wedding Theme - Johnette Napolitano3. Obviously It Was a Big Dope Weekend4. Slowly - Amon Tobin5. We Can Really Do This6. Ultrasound - Good Buddha7. We're Not Feeling So Great Now8. We're Thinking of Moving Up the Country - Rodriguez9. Sugar Man - Rodriguez10. Candy Went Missing11. Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten - Arvo P√§rt12. You Look So Beautiful13. Song to the Siren - Tim Buckley14. Once Upon a Time - Abbie Cornish
5,"Excellent, the best book I've read!",This is a great book. I recommend it to anyone who likes medical books or ones that leave you wanting to read more. I read it in about three or four hours.
4,"If you like books about medical stuff, read this book!!","Virus is a good book, but sometimes hard to follow. I enjoyed the story, but couldn't figure out some of the conflicts. Some of the things about Will and Susannah made me slightly confused and had to look through the book to understand. Overall, it was a good book"
5,Great Book!!!,"I think that this was a great book, that kept me always wanting to know more. I am definitely going to read the other books in the series!!!"
2,"small books, too few pictures","I ordered these books mainly because it said they were by Beatrix Potter. Not sure where she factors into these books because when they arrived it states they are by Derrydale Books. I figured if they were written by Beatrix Potter it would say so on the book- no where does it mention her name. Second, these books are pretty tiny.I guess good to throw in a diaper bag, maybe? My 18 month old loses interest because the left side of the page is several paragraphs and the right side is a picture. Right now this is just too many words and too few illustrations. Maybe better for older kids."
4,Progressive 'Nap,"A comment on the band. I remember these guys from the East side of Indianapolis, the ""In Crowd"" night club, circa 1974-5. Knew Kenny, too. But it was the BAND, Manchild, that was as progressive as they come, real ""Cool People."" There should be more honest-to-goodness bands like that doin' it in the clubs today.--Majok"
4,PUSH AND PULL GOOD IDEA,THE EASE OF THIS TOOL COMES FROM THE DEEP JAWS AND THE QUICK TURN AROUND HANDLES. THIS TOOL MAKES IT EASY TO CLAMP WOOD TOGETHER TO GLUE UP BOARDS OR IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE YOU CAN TURN THE MOVEABLE JAWS AND PUSH ITEMS APART TO FIX OR REGLUE.
4,Storage Cube,"Well as a 50+year old, yes I still own some vinyl, record albums that is, albums fit perfectly in the cube, I bought two, they look great side by side but I suppose you could stack them as well. I found that they are light weight yet strong and besides that they look neat & clean. I highly recommend them, plus they're not that expensive! Who said vinyl is dead ?"
2,Poor Quality,"I purchased this as part of my toy chest that I was making for my son. This was the biggest partition/module that i was able to find that could contain some big toys. The end result looks good as my husband made lemonade out of the lemons. The dowels don't fit at all, the holes don't line up and generally it's very poor construction. If you are a handy person then it will give you a pretty good end result from a distance."
2,Not Very Sturdy,"The item is not very sturdy. I does work partially work for what I needed it for, but I would not suggest putting much weight on it or stacking it."
3,Worked well for my needs,"This is easy to assemble. Quality is reasonable. It really deserves a 3.5. Purchased this to store old LP's. For those of you who don't know what LP''s are, they are vinyl 12 inch records, also know as ""long playing"". Many cube type storage cabinets are too small for LP's. They fit perfectly in this cabinet. I keep my records stored in the closet so looks don't really matter although the finish is acceptable but not high quality furniture."
5,Childhood Favorite,My grandmother read this book to me as a child. A hardback cover was hard to find - this seller had it! THANK YOU!
4,"gloria lynn vocals at her best, live performance",Years ago I heard a great jazz version of The End of A Love Affair by Gloria Lynne. I purchased this CD to enjoy the long forgotten track. The whole cd is a fun record of that earlier jazz era.
2,Stick to the Instrumentals Please,"Why oh why must so many guitarists try singing? Roger Trigaux (founder & erstwhile guitarist) sings weakly and off-key through the majority of this disc. The band is still a tight and tasty unit but it's impossible to ignore the sub-par vocals.Why Roger, why?"
4,Band Saw Blades: What's to like if they work and the do.,"A simple product that either works and holds up a reasonable amount of time or they are poor quality junk. These blades are of the first group. Nothing exciting, but the seem to work well and have lasted as well or better than others I have tried."
5,Breathtaking,"The illustrations and colors in this story convey so much of the mystery and wonder of the Easter story. My toddler son is captivated with the book and the little donkey, through whose eyes the story is told. I can't think of a better way to introduce a small child to this story. Admittedly, he doesn't really ""get"" the real story but we name the apostles and he describes what the donkey is doing and he calls Mary and Mary Magdalene the ""princesses""; I feel that he may ""get"" it more than I do."
5,And The Family Clone!,"What IS the Family Clone?It's Johnny Guitar Watson playingevery instrument on this 1981 recording.And when the vocorder comes in on ""Come Dance With Me"" it's the capper on a truelybizzare production from an artist noted for them.Watson'sscewed understanding of bluesy funk is on full throttle and evenat it's most bizzare moments,'Presents The Family Clone' has avery home spun quality for it's time and is one of the manyexcellent offerings cooked up by Watson over the years!"
5,Very Essential,Johnny Guitar Watson Was No Joke.He Could Do So Many Styles.His Guitar Playing was His Trademark.this DIsc Showcases His Greatness.He Grooves on Ain't Movin.One Of The Baddest Instrumentalists Ever.The Man Was Amazing On Different Instruments&Styles.this is a Must.
5,Noteworthy and Sophisticated,"As the now definitive scholarly work on Buibert of Nogent, Rubenstein's delightful insight into Nogent's life is a well-written and thoroughly researched book that deserves a place on any scholar's bookshelf."
5,Great Action Figure!,"This was by far the best of several Spiderman action figures we purchased for our 4 year-old. The super-poseability was truly amazing, my husband and I couldn't even believe all the ways the figure could move. Seems sturdy, has held up to a lot of throwing and dropping so far. Highly recommend!"
3,Table toy,"This only attaches to a table top which is no place for a toy. It did not take but a week for my 4 year old to break the line, and all spiderman does is hang on it. You pull the string down and a button pulls it back up. That's it!!"
5,Incredible poses,"This figure has incredible detail and is excellent to pose. It's only slightly more posable than the older ""Spider-Man Classics"" comic-based toys but much more detailed and better-looking. Not only do kids love it, but many artists I know have recommended it as a model. It's far easier to pose and draw from than traditional wooden models!"
5,The best action figure.,I own both the Spider-Man the Movie Figure: Super Poseable Spider-Man and the Spider-Man the Movie Figure: Super Poseable Green Goblin. They're both awesome. The Spider-Man is my favorite one and has awesome articulation (not that the Green Goblin doesn't). He is about as poseable as a real person. He's very durable. The only problem is that with mine the head is kind of wobbly. I doubt all of them are like that though. Probably just a mistake in the process of making it. Also the gargoyle ledge is awesome too. It has a zip-line so Spidey can rise up. I would definately recommend this action figure.
5,My album of the year for 1999,"This may pick up some critical raves at year end, but will probably escape widespread attention until the history books are written. An outstanding and eclectic blancmange of American gothic, eccentric instrumentation and wonderfully scary stories, Johnny Dowd's influences are plentiful but his voice is his own. The highlight is the awesome ""No Woman's Flesh But Hers"" which is in the grand tradition of the classic car-wreck songs. The twist in this one is that our hero was drunk when he crashed and his wife is now a vegetable. This is his poignant vow of faith to her. Mighty (weird). Reference points for the curious would include Hank Williams, Tom Waits and Nervous Norvus."
5,LOU REED MEETS VIC CHESNUTT,"Strange, demented off-beat southern roots rock with a guy who sounds like he completely lost his bearings. Johnny Dowd's a real beauty with his songs of love gone wrong, hangings, death and insanity. This disc is more or less slow moving with an eerie circus-like atmosphere to it. The woman helping him on vocals is brilliant. It doesn't get any better, or stranger than this!"
2,6 inches was too much,"The product is fine, but the height of 6 inches made it too difficult to get into and out of bed. I took them out and put them in the closet."
3,Superhero Novel Doesn't Fly,"I must admit the rewrite of the '30s crime novel was fairly well done, although the frequent use of the ""F"" word struck me as jarringly out of place. My problem with the book was that the protagonist, Harvey Gander, seemed so out of touch with what was really going on. Mainly I had the impression throughout that he didn't have a clue and that any progress he made in his ""investigation"" was luck more than anything else. The book wasn't all bad, of course, or I wouldn't have made it all the way through."
5,read in one sitting -- a complete page turner,"Got an advance copy of this book from a friend of mine at a publishing house in New York. He claimed this book was the next big one, a huge hit in the waiting. I had serious doubts, as I always do when people proclaim the next big one. But I will tell you now, and listen up good -- The Superlative Man is one of the best books I have ever read. From the moment I started, I was capitivated with story, descriptions, and surroundings. I was up til 3 in the morning on a workday, I could not put it down. I have not had the pleasure of doing that since my college days. I read the future of fiction writing last night, and his name is Herbert Thomas"
2,Disappointed,"I was extremely excited to hear about Kevin Toney and rushed out to buy his CD, but was disappointed with it. All of the songs sound like what we have all heard a million times, and I couldn't stop myself from thinking somebody else could have done them better. Sure Mr. Toney has talent but this CD doesn't display it very well or remove him from the pack of other average musicians."
5,An End to an Excellent Series,"This is an end to a very excellent series. I started the NJO series only a couple of years ago well after Vector Prime was out in paperback. Some of the books were slow, but others just cooked.The Unifying Force is one of those that cooked and twisted me around. All of the major characters are in this book as mentioned in the other reviews of this book. Some are mentioned others have camio appearances. There were several spots in the book where it felt like it could end, but I didn't want it to end, then I realized that I still have another 300+ pages to go.If you haven't started the NJO series yet....DO NOT read this book until you've finished off the other major novels in the NJO series. I'm very happy with the way the series is wrapped up."
4,I suppose it has to end at some point,"The ending of this series was a little disappointing. It wasn't quite as dramatic as I'd expect, and it didn't evoke any emotions like I thought it would. It just ended. I'm not into giving spoilers for those that still haven't read it, but I can say that you'll enjoy it if you like Star Wars. It does have the same Mega Bad Large Super Duper Space Battles of the other books, but it's tastefully done and Luceno does a good job keeping it interesting. I was just hoping for closure, and found a little less than was presented. The writing style is good, the story is just lacking a little. The plot seems to whither away at the end. Oh well, I still enjoyed it, although I won't dare you to read this though. If you like Star Wars it'll be nice to say you've read it though."
5,Great Ending,"This book was the perfect tying up of the New Jedi Order series. I have been following it since the first one came out in 1999 and got very emotional about this book. It is well writen with intrigue, suspence, and humor. Buy it, you'll like it"
5,"Good, but better","I have been a long time fan of star wars, I was very excited when NJO came out and as i'm sure happened to all of you Vector Prime rocked me to my very core, The bubble was gone, hero's could in fact die. Every book i read after that i expected a hero to die. The unifying Force was a good book, not as good as Vector Prime or Star by Star, but good. I thought the ending was almost to abrupt, I don't know if there will be anymore Star Wars books but i found myself lacking at the end, the conclusion to the war was satisfying, but the after effects left me wondering...what next? The battles were fantastic, I loved the inclusion of a certain Bounty Hunter that definetly satisfied me. All in All it was a good book....but i gotta ask..Whats Next?"
3,Pretty Good,"The book was pretty good.But not Great.The ending was definately a surprise....The action was good and plentiful...But somehow this book left me not completely satisfied.The best NJO book to me is still ""Destiny's Way""."
1,Thank God that travesty is over!!!,"The NJO at large is terrible, with one or two good books in it; unfortunately, the series ended in a very bad way. Hopefully the next series will be better."
5,I couldn't put it down! Which is very pleasing!,"This book is the best of the entire ""NJO"" series, it's gripping and fast-paced. The first thirty pages are a little dull, but if the reader will have patience, the book gets much better and ends up in a way that is satisfying but still leaves room for much more expansion of the Star Wars universe. One particular scene near the end was so exactly what it should have been that I got all teary-eyed, which never happens to me. I recommend this book to everybody!"
3,B+ ending to a C- series,"This novel is easily the most well written and entertaining in the series. However, they visit so many people and places that you really don't get any details on anyone. What happens to Tahiri? Dunno. What happens to Danni? Dunno. Han, Luke? Dunno dunno dunno.Also, the cop-out ending is far too convienent and contradicts nearly everything you have learned about the Republic, the Force, and the Vong. At the end you'll be saying ""I read 19 books for this cheap ending??""My overall impression is ""Thank god it's finally over."""
4,A great finale,"This book is amazing. The detail that went into the scenes was amazing and you could almost picture yourself with a lightsaber in the battle.James Luceno did an excellent job of tying up the loose ends but was in a kind of predicament because he needed to follow what other authors gave him. (This is why I think that another book was needed plus it would make the series an even 20 books)However, there were flaws in the story. Some scenes seemed a little rushed and other that needed more pages. Some of the dialogue was flat or non-existant. Luceno also did not seem to have the courage to kill any major characters so the losses did not seem as bad as they could have(hence the 4 stars).Other then that, it was a good read and I would recommend the NJO series to any Star Wars fan or Sci-fi reader."
5,A Fitting End,"The war with the Yuuzhan Vong is reaching its climax. Both sides are putting pressure on the other's ""base world"" and the jedi are spread out, some are even missing. The war is at its breaking point, the only question is who will crumble first.This book does a wonderful job of building up the anticipation that has been growing since the fall of Coruscant and the death of Anakin Solo. The ending of this book was a massive surprise as we finally have some big questions answered for us. We find out why the Jedi cannot sense the Yuuzhan Vong and we find out who is really running the Yuuzhan Vong war machine. An outstanding end to an outstanding series!"
4,Not much Variation neither a lot of Mule,"Ok I must admit it, it's not ""his finest hour"", but even so you won't regret the money, there's a couple of fine tunes around, cool lyrics and cool cover art. If you 're a beginner in Tom Waits music, this album will make you look for more..."
1,Don't spend the extra cash,"If you are going to buy Mule Variations, one of Waits' weakest albums, don't waste the extra money to get this import. It has two extra tracks: ""Buzz Fledderjohn"" and ""Big Face Money."" The first is one of the better songs on the entire CD, but that isn't saying much. The second is 39 seconds long and sounds more like a clip from some longer song. I don't understand all the great reviews Mule Variations has received. There are a couple of amusing tracks, but they lack originallity. In my personal opinion, the best thing about this album is it's cool Dave-McKean-esque artwork (which again lacks originallity as it is mimicing the style of another artist) I recommend Mule Variations only to curious fans and this import should be purchased exclusively by those obsessive completists."
1,DISAPPOINTMENT,"AFTER MANY YEARS OF SMOKING AND DRINKING, THE AFFECTS ARE SO CLEAR THRU THE PASSAGE OF TIME, TOM HAS LOST HIS VOICE. THIS CD WAS SO POORLY CONFIGURED AND EXECUTED THAT THE SINGER SOUNDS AS IF HE IS CRAWLING OUT OF THE GRAVE! HE SOUNDS WORSE THAN LEONARD COHEN THESE DAYS! I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS SAYING, OR CARE TOO. THE MUSIC IS JUST PLAN AWFUL AND LACKS ANYTHING ORIGINAL. HIS EARLIER WORKS ARE SO SUPERIOR IN EVERY WAY."
2,Horrible Music,It was 2:00 a.m. I heard a horrible sound it was my older brothers radio blaring that horrible horrible music told him to stop that music. It was Horrible.
3,"IT'S 7 INCH, IT'S ELECTRIC, BUT IT'S NOT THAT SILENT.","i wanted a quiet flat-profile fan to place behind my flat screen tv which heats up quite a bit, in hopes of cooling it down and extending its life. this is a good little fan with plenty of power, but i would not consider it ""silent"" by any means. i wish it had one more slower speed which would then probably fill the bill for my usage."
2,Not as quiet as lead to believe ...,All in all ... its a desktop fan. I was looking for an ultra-quiet fan ... this is not it.
2,Thumbs Down,"I purchased this fan through Amazon in March 2011 and it has been a big disappointment. At first, it circulated air fine, although NOT notably silent. I purchased it for the master bathroom to keep air circulating with all the lights on and the blow dryer blowing, etc., just to keep things extra comfortable while getting ready for work. Then over the course of a couple of months, it didn't seem to move air hardly at all, regardless of fan speed. Even if I stood directly in front of the fan just inches away, there was no discernible breeze. Initially, I chalked this up to the hot, hot months of summer in AZ, although I am liberal with my ac usage. But as summer passed into fall, and fall into winter, I really cannot tell the fan is on (if it weren't for the noise.) Bummer - now I am online looking for a new fan for the master bath, which won't be a SPT brand."
1,Not silent,This fan is labeled as a silent fan. It is very loud on its lowest setting and the fact that it is advertised as silent is false. The entire fan is plastic so it looks extremely cheap.
2,"Not Silent, decent airflow","This fan is not silent. Quieter than normal but defiantly not silent, even on the lowest setting. I work in cubicles and the lady in the next cube can hear when it is on. It has decent airflow though for it's size.PS the fan does not angle straight or down. Sitting on it's stand the lowest it goes is pointed slightly up.Edit: It has gotten louder now that it is older, thinking of getting a new DIFFERENT fan."
2,Nothing silent about this fan.,"We were disappointed by this fan. It is listed as a silent table fan and it's anything but silent. High-pitch fan noise! Great for an office work area but not for a bedroom.Also it doesn't tilt further forward than what you see in the photo. It tilts back more - pointing to the ceiling. So you cannot aim this at you from a dresser.Thank heavens AMAZON accepted it back due to the inaccurate listing of this as a ""silent"" fan.We purchased this fan and we are EXTREMELY happy with it. Compact, oscillates and is nearly silent.Lasko 4000 Air Stik Ultra-Slim Oscillating Fan for $27.99Lasko 4000 Air Stik Ultra-Slim Oscillating Fan"
1,Not a Silent Fan,"I bought this fan expecting a very quiet fan, it's not quiet. There are much quieter fans out there, and for cheaper prices.If you're looking for a medium sized fan, and noise isn't an issue, get this, but otherwise, stay away."
3,this is okay...,"Im an impulsive person, I bought this album just by listening to the 10 second clip of ""where the lil soldiers at?"" I wish I wouldnt have bought it unless it was a single 4 that song, some of the songs had a really good catchy chorus to them, but these raps are horrible! they rap about girls that have clean rooms, mama needin a new blouse, favorite snaks after takin a nap, gosh, how corny is that? Of course there only like 7 or 8 yrs old, but duh! its horrible, close2you is a good track though, they sing it to there moms. Dont buy this UNLESS youve previewd it 1st!"
3,OK,"this is ok, but one of the songs I don't get at all! cuz right now there only like 7 or 8 yrs old and in one of the songs they go ""you first heard of us on the mean green drink they call HI-C we was here many years ago..."" duh they were around many years ago! they havent even been around for many years! how stupid!"
1,8 & 6 year olds can't rap,"as many of us know little kids can't rap. they dont even have a parental advisory, they suck, i've heard a couple songs, don't buy this CD."
1,I think it's going to be weak,Their weak on their no limit compilations. No limit is tight but you don't need little 4 year olds with you. They don't even know what their rapping about
1,Don't rush into things...,"I heard these kids, and they got talent, but 8 and 6 year olds CAN'T RAP they defenetly have a future, but signing them now was probably the biggest mistake No Limit Records will ever make (probably the only mistake No Limit will ever make) But props, they got a future, they just gotta wait for their turn 2 shine."
4,ITS THE SHITZNIT!!!,"This is a good CD. I expected for it to be better,but its still pretty good. BUY THIS, BUT IF YOU DON'T IT WON'T BE TOO MUCH OF A LOSS! I like ""School on lock"". It's the best song on this CD!!!!!"
5,LIL'SOLDIER IS TEAR N THE ROOF OFF!!!!,"THIS CD IS TIGHT ,PLEASE GET THIS CD IT ALL THAT .THE FIRST SONG IS OFFTHE HOOK ""YA HEARD ME""."
4,young soulja,this ia an tight no limit album for the youngens I think they will be even better in the feature but they did the damn thing next album is coming out in aug 2004 on Tru Records and thats Tru
1,Is this a joke?? I Must Be On Candid Camera!! Right???!!!,"Oh, God, this made me laugh so hard I can barely type. Two little ghetto chiljin, no older than the wee age of 7, decide to release a dirty rap album with explicit lyrics....oh god..........our world is eighty thousand times more f**ked up than I thought it was....dear God....(...)!!!!!!! Is this a JOKE??!! Did this album actually happen???!!!! Did people REALLY spend time MAKING this???!!! Oh, God, these are some lucky-ass little babies with some stupid-ass parents."
1,plastic gloves with cut middle finger,"Bought this in a store. One of the plastic gloves inside had the middle finger cut which made it unusable; it was a pain using only one hand. After checking the label, I noticed it was manufactured in Brazil. I wonder if the cut middle finger isn't a message from the assembly line workers regarding how well they are paid/treated by this company. Otherwise why the sabotage?Oh yeah - and just to elucidate the one-star review: the color was blah and it went away in the shortest time I've ever experienced."
1,attractive watch; poor quality,"This watch has a comfortable soft band and pretty feminine styling. Unfortunately it doesn't work. After two months it stopped completely. I sent it back for warranty (which cost me the price of shipping plus a ridiculous $25 for them to ship it back to me.) Two months later they returned the watch to me, saying the second hand had been stuck but now was fixed. Sure enough the second hand works now, but only intermittently. The watch doesn't keep time - it loses an hour or two each day. I called Invicta again and they want me to ship it back to them a second time at my expense. The quality of the watch is quite low & the customer service only slightly better. I would strongly recommend against purchasing this watch even though it is pretty. You'd be better off buying a pretty bracelet and checking your cell phone for the time."
3,Misrepresented Toy,"If a product description says ""Phil Hartman as Troy McClure,"" one would think that it used Phil Hartman's voice in the toy. You would simply push the button to hear the thing say, ""Hi, I'm actor Troy McClure. Perhaps you remember me from such films as P is for Psycho"" and ""The Revenge of Abe Lincoln"". Non?It doesn't!I plunked down the [$$$] for this product EXCITEDLY as I couldn't wait to hear one of my favorite comedic actors do his Troy McClure schtick. I was disappointed to learn I have to purchase the Simpson's Kitchen or Krusty Burger ""Interactive Environments"" to here sweet Phil do Troy. And it costs an extra [$$$]!How about some truth in advertising: mention you need to buy the dang ""evironment"" to get the toy to do what made you purchase the friggin thing in the first place."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"I needed a bed cover that would mostly seal the bed, but was easy to gain access to the bed when needed. I looked at several models, but decided that based on the reviews, the TruXedo was the best option. I'm glad I paid a little extra for a well-reviewed product. It worked out great. I would highly recommend it to anyone!"
2,Not so amazing art duffle bag,"It would appear from the picture of the ""amazing art duffle bag"" that it is chock full of fun art supplies. This is not the case. The bag consist of a pack of 8 fat markers, a pack of 8 skinny markers, a box of 16 crayons, a 6 pack of fat chalk, and a thin writing pad. You could easily buy the items strategically placed on the outside of this bag for about $9.00- The entire middle portion of the bag is empty! There is nothing amazing about the art duffle bag except the nerve of Crayola to mislead people. Save your money!"
1,Missing pieces,"I am very disappointed with this product. The amazing art duffle bag came in almost empty. Promised bags of modeling clay, stamping markers, stickers and the activity booklet was nowhere to be found. Then I started reading the other reviews about this product and sadly realized that I was not the only one... I can't believe Crayola continues to ship the product half empty. It is about time that someone takes an action..."
1,Disapointed Customer,"I was very disappointed when I opened up this package. I had bought it for a Christmas present for a close relative. The duffle was missing the stampers, model magic pouches and activity book. Instead of those items being there, a large piece of cardboard filled up the space. I don't know if it was a mistake or not, but I must say that I am very disapointed. The picture and description of the duffle are very decieving."
1,Broke in less than 6 months,"It worked well for about six months. It still read CD's but won't burn them. Don't buy especially for the price the sell for. I read some reviews of some of their older products, apparently their older burners were good, but this one is junk. Save yourself a bunch of grief and buy something else."
1,Never Worked. Horrible Support,"I bought this drive several month ago. It never installed properly, and I have been chasing a ghost of a support staff ever since. I have made phone contact on 2 occasions and email contact on 2 occasions. No one is ever there when I call or on there supposed ""live"" web support. Do not buy this product!"
1,PIECE OF SH*@!!!!,"I bought this product and I have never had it work. It will read cd's but it will not write or rewrite anything. I thought it was just that I didnt have the right software for it so I didnt send it back. I wish that I had sent it back. I would only recamend this product as an expensive paper weight, or as an automatic computer cup holder. Oh wait scrach that, now it wont even open up. WORTHLESS... AHHHHH!!!!"
1,Worst support I have ever seen,"I bought this burner, and it was broken in less than one year. I tried to contact the manufacture, but I could never be able to talk to a human being. They only have one telephone number, but never answer the phone calls. They don't let you wait, they let you leave message, but nobody returns your call. This is the worst service I have ever seen !!"
1,Don't bother,"Burnt about 3 CD's before it died. Contacted their customer service web page several times - no replies. Cannot read mini-discs, even though it has the slot - it hangs the OS (running Windows ME). Ended up tossing it, since it only cost $9 after all the rebates, it wasn't worth pursuing any warranty claim."
1,Bad joke,"This book waste a page to explain: download speed = file size/bit rate even with ilustration (WOW). The rest of the book has the same technical level.Amazon, dont you check what you sell?"
5,Lynn Anderson -- 2 GREAT LPs,"When I was a kid, these two LPs were literally worn out by too much use! BOTH albums are Lynn at her prime as a vocalist, and a hit maker. To have both, with remastered sound, PLUS bonus tracks, is really a find. Don't let this pass you buy. You will find a LOT more than ""Rose Garden"" to love. Like ALL the rest as well!"
3,"Sometimes handy, but too expensive to just sit on shelf.","Usually wide clamps are for gluing up panels. Sometimes they are used for holding wide projects together, but not usually. This clamp is designed for specific projects, and unless can think of a specific project that this clamp is especially useful, dont buy it. Use a cheaper pipe/bar clamp for the project. The money that you save from not buying this will allow you to upgrade somewhere else in your shop. PROS** Non marring** Lightweight** One hand clampable. (you can hold the piece with one hand and clamp with the other.CONS** Really expensive** Doesn't exert the force of other types of clamps. (dont plan on gluing up)"
4,"An IMMENSELY long read...but oh, WHAT a read!","I will agree with some of the previous reviewers, in that this book dealt almost exclusively with the negative side of the human experience (and in some cases that's putting it mildly). But Ms. Morris knows how to write, and does a superb job here. She never failed to hold my interest - though the plot started to sag a little bit at the end.The dialog was a bit stilted, and some of the characters (mostly the secondary ones) were a bit unbelievable (Sam Fermoyle's shrink at the institute, for one) - and does anyone actually KNOW someone who says ""Yah"" instead of ""Yeah""? But at the end, it does seem as though the Fermoyles are starting to turn the corner - and I wish them all the best."
2,Oprah's book club gone wrong,"I finished this book for the sole reason of lack of anything better. I found myself skipping over large chunks that simply weren't worth it, opting for sleep instead. This is not one of those books you can read in a weekend, it's one that you pick up in between others. I do not recommend this book. I would rather promote reading the back of the cereal box. that's a joke. ha ha."
5,Lyrical prose,"I find it so hard to believe that there are readers who don't like this book! It is one of the best I have read in years. The book reflects life for one whole stratum of our society, one that is infrequently portrayed accurately in the media. The characters face difficult choices and do not always choose well, yet they engage our interest and our sympathy. The book starts with a twist and grabs our attention. The prose is a joy to read - and to reread. This is a book to read more than once."
2,Get Out The Razor Blades,"This is THE most depressing book I've ever read. Seriously, I went into a major funk for the two days I was reading it. I suppose it's well written??? That seems to be the majority opinion. But I guess I need to see some character in the book that I can at least like. None here. Read this only if you have a great need to fall into a major depression."
4,Spellbinding!,"To me, the book was hard to get interested in at first but the more I read it, the harder it was to put down. The author did a superb job of showing how hard it is for a woman raising a family of her own, letting the reader know of the struggles the mother went through to raise her children. How true to life it is because some women seem to attract men who want to set themselves up in their lives only to take advantage of their good natures."
4,"Hard to put down, but...","If you are looking for an engrossing story with great characters, this is a must read. At first it was a challenge to keep all of the characters straight, but I grew to like the quick changing of points of view. The characters made me laugh, cry, and worry about them. I just wanted to give Benjy a hug! The end was a bit disappointing for me because I felt cut off too abruptly from the plot. I was left wondering what happened to them all..."
5,WHAT A WONDERFUL BOOK !,I absolutely loved this book and became increasingly sad the closer I came to the end. Morris does it again - her wonderful characters who you love to hate and who you hate to love and who in the end no matter how despicable or disgusting or disagreeable engender your empathy -how she does this I will never know. This is truly one of the finest works of fiction I have read in the last few years and I cannot wait for her next novel.
1,"It's a ""love it or hate it"" book","Songs in Ordinary Time isn't a hard read because it's long or unique or sophisticated or suited only for highly literate tastes. It's a hard read because there are too many characters and points of view, some of the story lines go nowhere, and all of the characters continue to make bad choices throughout the novel with no sign of enlightenment or hope of redemption. If you're a reader who likes unmitigated dysfunctionality painted on a large canvas, you'll love this book. If you're a reader who wants to root for the characters or rejoice in them learning from their mistakes, you'll hate this book. I'm in the ""hate it"" category."
1,Full of the most forgetable characters I have ever met.,"I am advising all my friends not to read this book. Every character is pathetic. Every situation is hopeless. Who would ever want to meet or be interested in a person like Marie Fermoyle? Omar Duvall is truly a villain, but it shouldn't have taken 740 pages to tell us that. Ms. Morris' writing is not extraordinary in any way. There were many many scenes that could have been deleted from the story and never missed. I wished I had never started to read this one."
2,"Dull, quiet Vermont town filled with characters worthy of it","Slow, dull-witted plot woven around a group of characters that can only be described as pathetic. It isn't that the story is bad, but that the story meanders like cold molasses and for what seems like an eternity. The stock characters include a pathetic woman, acon-man, a lust-tainted catholic priest, a small town, poor black victims of murder. Trite and unconvincing not a novel worthy of all the hooplah."
5,Wonderfully rich,"Many other reviewers mention the slow start of the book, and that the language and the many changes of who's thoughts are being broadcasted seem confusing, but that's a type of writing style I admire. I honestly didn't even notice the slow start because I love Morris's usage of descriptive language. Using descriptive language, especially in this case, lets you get closer to the characters, and all of their experiences were made more heartfelt."
4,Begins and evolves as ordinary..but !!,"An extraordinary book, that begins and evolves slowly and as the story unfolds it seems terribly ordinary as in the title. But beneath the prose lies an extraordinary understanding of her characters that claims your attention so that you must continue and finish reading the book to discover where they end up. I'm satisfied that I completed reading it, but at times I found it hard going. If your looking for suspense or thrills, forget it for this is an awesome book about ordinary people that live in an ordinary town living for the most part ordinary lives. One vulnerable but fascinating family have the misfortune to encounter a life sucking salesman that they can't seem to shake off. But it ends beautifully in the end, it just took quite some perservarance to get there. Worth the trouble though so I gave it four out of five. Writer perhaps has her best writing ahead of her."
1,I wish I could give it no stars!!!,"When I was choosing a book to drive cross country with, I picked up this book thinking - it's long, the synopsis showed potential and Oprah thought it was good. It was the only disappointing aspect of my trip! It was an easy read - fairly interesting characters and evoked disgust and utter frustration at Marie's unwillingness to see what Omar really was. The reason this book was so awful was the ending - or rather the lack of an ending. I truly thought that a chapter had been left out of my book. It almost as if the author got tired of writing and just sent the book off to the publisher with out finishing it. I would have liked to see some sort of resolution or closure, but there was none! I am disappointed that I spent so much time and money on this book and my mission is to make sure no one else does the same!"
2,Disappointing,"I was ready to put this down after 150 pages because it was SO depressing, but I stuck it out on principle. After about 350 pages I decided to finish it just because I already had so much time invested in it, and I was curious to see how all the plots would come out in the end. Well, nothing was tied up neatly. I was hoping for at least one of these sorry characters to have an uplifting experience, but alas it was not to be. This was the first book I have read by this author, and I believe it will be my last."
2,Unworthy of Oprah's endorsement,"I agree with the first three reviews I read...simply not worth the time. Maybe Oprah saw something I didn't, but I can honestly say I've never been so frustrated by ANY fictional characters as I was with the entire Fermoyle family. What a bunch of losers! Usually I can empathize with downtrodden characters, but Ms. Morris took these past my limit. I finished the book only because I kept hoping it would get better."
1,A Waste of Time,"I have never before read about such a bunch of misfits in my life. The characters were so outrageous, not even close to anyone I could relate to. I think Oprah needs to look into more upbeat readings."
2,Get a new editor at Penguin!,"Although this book has a few good moments, they are unfortunately few and far between. One problem: the sense of time. It reads as if she just wrote it in ""any time"" and then decided (with the help of her editor?) to set it in 1960. As a result, most of the story reads as if it's anytime, except that every now and then Morris waves a little ""1960 flag""--like mentioning a particular song on the radio or putting someone's bank book in the typewriter to enter a new balance. Very distracting! Also I believe that she truly WANTS us to feel compassion for her characters, but there are simply too many in this book--resulting in half-baked portraits of many people rather than fully presented characters whose motivations we can understand and appreciate. These are problems that should have been cleaned up by a talented editor at Penguin. Too bad she didn't have one."
1,Songs in Ordinary Time lacks plot,"After reading Morris' ""Songs In Ordinary Time"" I was greatly disappointed. The book didn't go anywhere. Nothing happened. The story line was bland and incredibly unexciting. The novel just seemed to have no plot. I do not reccommend this book to anyone."
2,an annoying chore.,"I have for the most part stayed away from Oprah's book club selections. I have found in general that the story lines are as follows....I was raped, I was poor, I was raped again and then somebody died. I decided to ignore my instincts and gave Songs in Ordinary Time a go. This book should be re-titled ""All the Things That Could Go Wrong In a Small Town For 800 Pages"" This book was relentless almost to the point of being humorous. There was no pinnacle, no point and then the book was done. I suppose life is often that way too.....so if you live a life of miserable and quiet desparation and you would like a little more of the same read this book."
1,Do not waste your time,"First, as a native, there is nothing more irritating than reading (or hearing) what is purported to be a central Vermont accent. In as much as Ms. Morris lives in Massachusetts, she ought to know there are more than a dozen spoken dialects in New England. Not one of them 'sounds' anything like what she's written.Second, as a reader, one shouldn't have to spend the first 40 pages of a novel writing down twenty-plus characters' names and relationship in order to follow the storyline. Then again, it would be a gross exaggeration to say there is a storyline in the first 100 pages.Speaking of names, what the heck is with the odd names? First names: Jarden, Jozia, Grondine, Astrid, Renie, Omar, Laydee- in VERMONT?! Puh-leez...I only wish this novel had a hole drilled through it so I could hang it next to the commode with the almanac. Instead, it's headed to the kindling box so as not to inflict another reader with rubbish."
1,I can't believe I wasted many hours reading this book!,I bought this book because it was in Oprah's book club. Waste of my time and money. I should have read the reviews before I bought it.
1,A snow-covered dung heap,"Mrs. Morris is undeniably a fine writer; one wonders why she squanders her talent on such a convoluted, squalid, unbelievable story. The characters became caricatures as they smash up against one crisis after another, intersecting each other's lives in confusing, random and often depraved ways. I wanted to shower after each bout with it. A deeply unsatisfying read."
4,This book really hit home.,"As the eldest child raised in a ""single-mom household,"" I felt Morris really captured the intimate feelings of the entire family. It was entertaining, enlighting, and an emotional adventure."
1,Disturbing!,"If you're considering reading this book, don't be misled--1 star is as low a rating as is allowed for these reviewsIf you're looking for entertainment, this book isn't it. Zero stars is my rating."
1,"Uninteresting, unnerving at points, depressing and dull","There were definitely too many uninteresting characters. I was finding myself relieved to get away from Marie Fermoyle every once in awhile, just to get involved with someone else with depressing problems. There was not one light-hearted, nice, smiling character without huge personality flaws. It was quite unnerving at points. It was definitely not an enjoyable read."
1,"Proves that well-written books can be awful, too.","I felt like I lived in the slough of despair while I was reading this dreadful book. If it had not been my next book group book, I would not have read past the scene with the 30-hours-dead judge in the chair at the boarding house. What was the point of that scene? It certainly wasn't something that would happen in ""ordinary time,"" and I can't believe that kind of thing is customary in small towns, or towns of any size. The people involved turned out to be very minor characters. It was there just for the shock value. At the beginning of the book, the author could have said, ""All of the people in this town have led, lead, and will always lead miserable, depressing, horrible lives,"" and made the book 500 pages shorter."
1,Boredom interrupted by brief intervals of depression,"I thought this book dragged. I have never read about a more miserable bunch of people in my life. Dysfunction was the theme of which there was no escape and no happy ending. I couldn't believe Oprah liked this. After reading this book, I now browse thoroughly the books she recommends before I buy them."
2,Hanging in there !,"I couldn`t seem to get into this book. I`m going to continue ,only because I`m on page 502. I`m starting to think I should have put this book to rest long ago. I`ve read 5 other novels in between this one since the beginning of june. I will persevere only because I`m sure in the end I`ll be glad. Maybe ,just maybe ,there will be some kind of life lesson to be learned. Although I see none in sight ! Laurie Marchand"
2,"If you really want to read this, buy it at a garage sale!","To summarize: I wish that I had not spent my money on this book. The characters went nowhere, the writing was substandard and displayed neither creativity nor imagery; sure it was a semi-interesting story, but I expected more."
1,Terrible!,"This was by far the worst book I have ever read. I kept reading because I figured it couldn't get any worse--but it did. It was depressing, and the skipping around of story lines made it hard to get into. I forced myself to continue figuring something good had to happen to somebody at some point--and it didn't. I'm sorry I wasted my time."
1,Help! Save me!,Often I enjoy reading off-the-wall tales of off-the-wall people leading off-the-wall lives. I did not enjoy reading this book. The characters are ALL so unrelentingly neurotic/psychotic that by page 400 I couldn't stand to read another word about them and thankfully gave myself permission to quit reading the book.
3,Was any of her other novels any good??,"There is so much information to soak in, the characters, their individual personalities, their relationships, that had me anticipating an exciting ending. Needless to say that did not happen ... Did she run out of ideas??"
2,Could have been 300 pages shorter...,"I really trust Oprah's taste in books but I think she sorely missed on this one. (Badly enough that I'm taking time warn others in this review). I felt as if I'd read this story in some other grade B book or movie along the way. I plugged along right until the book's end, hoping it would get better but it never did. It was very hard to feel any sympathy for Marie Fermoyle who was simply pathetic. The characters were exaggerated and cartoonish in their words and actions. I felt insulted by them. Save yourself 700+ pages of agony and read something (just about anything) else. I don't think there was one character in the book who was realistic enough to like. I was sorry I used so much time trying to get into it."
3,Not her best,"Even for end of the day, escapism after work type reading, this novel failed to keep my attention. The structure feels as uncontrolled as the meanderings of the town drunk who stumbles into everyone's lives. The characters all seem doomed from the beginning from a combination of their own human failings and the outside forces -- poverty, family, reputation -- that work against whatever hopes they have to rise above their current squalor. When they make the effort to penetrate one another's misery and be of comfort, only fear and hostility result.Morris' ""Vanished"" was one of those books that when I read it I was astonished at how the language lay over the story like clear water, no distortion at all, just magnification and clarity, like a fantastically vivid dream. I couldn't put that book down -- this one I couldn't pick up without a sigh of ""Jeez, look how LONG it is...""."
2,A Snoozer,"This book was very difficult to keep my interest. Aside from it being a depressing story, it had too many characters. I often found it difficult to keep track of who was who. This book was not the worst I've ever read, but it did not keep my attention. I usually like to finish a book once I begin reading it, but this book I had to put down. It was more like a bedtime story opposed to an interesting read. I definitely would not recommewnd this book to others. Honestly, I have read other Oprah's book club picks and this is the first one I did not like at all."
1,"Beautifully written but boring, with unlikeable characters","I have trouble understanding why this was an Oprah book. It is twice as long as necessary. The characters are weak, stupid, and unlikeable. Alice was OK, but the rest were disgusting. There are some beautiful passages, but there's not much plot. The whole thing is just a bore. If the universities keep giving tenure to people who write stuff like this, we'll just get more and more of it."
1,"If you don't like the characters, you won't like the book","Although very well written, and so compelling I couldn't give up on it, there's not one likeable person in this book! They're all whiners and users and the most sympathetic character is the chief of police who is having an affair with the sister-in-law of his dying wife ... and it goes downhill from there. DEPRESSING!!!"
4,re: cassette edition,"For those of you who listen to audiobooks, I thought this was very well produced and narrated. Often for me, this will make or break an audio, no matter how well written. Kate Burton does a fantastic job of character impersonation and southern and northern dialects. I was quickly swept up into the story - and yes, I found the story sad, frustrating, and powerful. For an audio to evoke those emotions means it's well worth purchasing."
4,There must be a sequel!,"I enjoyed this story, the little town, the well developed characters, but what happened in the last chapter?? My first thought was that the author's agent knocked on her door and said hand me the book -NOW! There must be a sequel coming right? Say it's so - Mary!!"
3,What does the title mean?,I am still not quite sure if I enjoyed this book. I agree with the comment that the first half of the book seems long. The end really makes you wonder... I feel up in the air still.If you like lots of descriptions and good character development then I think you'd like this book. But what does the title have to do with the story?
2,Songs in ordinary time took too much of my time,The story was totally unbelievable with the characters shown as being gullible and weak. The beginning of the book was confusing with too many characters being introduced too soon. But once you finally figured out who was who you wanted to forget them. Definately a must miss in my book
1,Please don't waste your money!,"I don't think I have ever read a book that left such a bad taste in my mouth. To start, some of the author's descriptions should definately not be read while eating. It is possible to be graphic without being gross, but Morris must not know this! Also, every character in the book is bitter and/or disturbed. The only person I liked was the bad guy - he was the only one not continually complaining! Lastly, the book ends on what should have been a turning point for the most bitter character, but true to her nature, she ruins not only a potentially beautiful moment, but the end of the book as well."
2,A difficult Read,"I found this book a very difficult read. It was interesting only in the beginning, but as you went on and discovered more and more characters and plots it became difficult to follow, uninteresting and depressing. I kept hoping for the mother to redeem herself with her children as she kept begging forgiveness from God each time she harrassed and mentally abused them. This redemption never came and it was very disappointing. Omar Duvall was shallow and easy to see through and although all of the characters repeatedly realized this, they never made a move. Not worth the effort of wading through such a long book."
1,THIS is a NY Times Best-Seller???,"I am disappointed, to say the list, that this book reached the NY Times best-seller list and has maintained a #1 position for as long as it has. It is a slow-moving, boring, overly-long book centered around a group of very shallow people. Couldn't this have been done in a LOT fewer pages?The only reason that I made it to the end was because I was reading it while riding in a car, without another book in sight!"
2,"Boring. Very ordinary, struggle to read","Uninteresting, shallow characters who are rather stereotypical. No great shakes, which is okay, but I thought there would be more character development. Too many flowery descriptions, but no real insight to characters, who they are, what they want, etc. It's a character driven story, with no character development"
2,Like watching a 740 page car wreck..,"...and afterward, the best thing that you could say about it was that some of the explosions were lovely and a few of the people weren't too horribly maimed.The prose was well executed, which is why I'm giving this book two stars instead of one. There was sort of a terrible beauty to the way that the characters lives interacted, with one tragedy creating a series of others. It was also engrossing. I read until sunrise more than once. Mostly because I just wanted to get it over with. I wasn't looking for some sort of a fairy tale ending, but you do come to care about what happens to these characters, especially the kids, and some sort of resolution and/or growth may have stemmed my frustration with this long and very sad book.Another reviewer said it well: Only read this book if you have too much happiness in your life. This one goes back to the thrift store from whence it came."
1,One of the worst books ever!,"As I lurched through all 600-plus pages I kept hoping any of the characters would at least have one good day! I got tired of the characters expressing themselves mostly in gasps, moans, cries, or hysterical laughter. They seemed always on the verge of complete breakdowns, even when situations didn't warrant that behavior. The story would have been more believable and the characters more real if at least some of them had less hysterical reactions to everything. There were too many characters in the book, and as one reviewer noted, most of them were not developed enough; the reader often was left dangling about their motivations, personalities, and especially their fates. I suppose the author was going for a ""real life"" feel in the book, but if that is real life, let me fall on my sword! This is a terrible book and I'm annoyed at the time wasted reading it."
1,Not one likable character in the entire book,"This book really annoyed me. I am normally not bothered by long books, but this one seemed like it went on forever. None of the characters had redeeming traits - who were the protagonists supposed to be? Certainly not ignorant Marie - even her own kids could see she was being swindled. Worse yet, none of these pathetic characters seemed to learn anything from their mistakes. I kept hoping it would get better; it didn't. Seems like Oprah is making some pretty poor book choices lately."
1,This story didn't need to be told in over 700 pages.,The reading group I belong to chose this book and most of us really disliked it. The characters are not interesting enough to merit 700+ pages. The ending was disappointing - it ended because at some point it had to. Lame. Negative story without interesting characters. We all agreed - why? A waste of paper in my opinion.Lisa in Philly
5,Amazing!,"Though it was a long read, the intricacies of this distraught family's day to day life intirgued me. I could barely put it down! Marie's struggle, her new found confidence in Omar, Norm and Alice's hatreed and mistrust of Omar and Benjy's need for Omar to make his mother happy again, as well as the other characters kept me coming back for more. The side stories of different characters all wind in together so that the story centers on the Fermoyles but every other charcater and side-plot is careful weaved into it. I would recommend this book to everyone ti was fantastic!"
3,if you can get through the first half,"If you can get through the first half of this book, the second half is your reward. The closer this book gets to the end, the better it gets. The first half lacks plot entirely and is almost entirely about the characters and all their misery, suffering, etc. Generally a book needs a plot to be interesting, unfortunately it is not until the second half of this book that this happens. Read Vanished by this same author--now there is a 5* book."
2,Disappointing,"The action and intrigue in this book, like the words of its evil character Omar Duvall, are just promises. The reader is set up again and again expecting a worthwhile resolution and continuously disappointed. As such, after spending weeks with these miserable, self-denying townsfolk, the ""happy"" ending offered in not believable - it is incongruous with the author's 700 pages of character development. Skip this book and avoid the feelings of disappointment so well illustrated through the characters in Songs in Ordinary Time."
1,"Long, Long, Long",I have a policy to always finish a book once I start it. This book was almost enough to make me break my policy. After 800 odd pages I could not have cared less what happened to any one of these characters. The book was not at all gripping at any point and I plodded through each page. Another book like this and I will seriously reconsider my book reading policy as this one never came up with one redeeming quality.
1,Songs In Ordinary Time,"This book was indeed hard to get into, but once I figured it out, it went more smoothly. I read this book in about a week because I have lots of free time. Why did I read it so fast? Was it enjoyable? No, no, and no again. I didn't like the book because it was a story of a family who I wouldn't want to know, living in a place I wouldn't want to visit, doing things I didn't care about. By the time I was about 1/3 of the way into the book I started disliking it. The author uses so many words to get to the point it becomes rather tiring. Towards the end, I would skip lines just to get to the point of that ""chapter"". This was the first of Oprah's book selections that I didn't like at all. The reason I read it to the end? I thought it would get better. It didn't"
2,748 looooooooooong pages,"A co-worker, when she saw this book laying on my desk, told me to keep at it, ""it eventually gets good,"" she said. She lied. She suggested, when I finally got to page 300, that I skim. I read a paragraph of each page and finally got through it. I never connected with the characters, except maybe for Benji, the youngest child of Marie, a psycho mother who blames everyone but herself for her pathetic life. It centers around a scam artist murderer who charms his way into Marie's life and Benji who knows the man's secret but won't risk his mother's happiness to tell her what he knows. Save your time and your money."
1,worst book I've ever read,"We read this for our book club and it was voted the book we would most like to burn. Which we are actually considering for the torture it put us though. (There was, in all honesty, one person who liked it.) If you want to be totally depressed I would highly recommend this book. The characters, especially the mother, were pitiful stupid creatures. If some of them had died in the end I would have felt a little better about it. I love to read and this is the first book that I have ever read where I literally hated reading every page. I can't wait for the bonfire!"
1,Snooze Fest,I regret ever picking up this book and I wish I had the sense to give up. I kept waiting for something to happen. And it ended so abruptly! I was so angry I put it in the recycling bin.
4,If you have patience...,"If you can get through the first 150 pages, you'll be happy you did. With a slow start, that's when the story really starts to pick up & you start to remember the characters, there's a lot of them! I agree with an earlier reviewer in that there were too many sub-plots & characters.I did end up liking the book, and I was VERY close to putting it down & not finishing it. I am glad I stuck it out.The characters are memorable. Their plights, long & hard.You will cringe with them when things go wrong. It's a story that is so believable it feels real. I see why Oprah picked it.Just remember, there are many books that start off slow, but they don't always have such a rewarding ending."
1,A good book to read if you don't have a life of your own.,"Talk about a con job! I agree, too many characters. It doesn't feel like a full novel; it feels crowded, and that's a big difference. And how in the world can we appreciate any of the Fermoyles when they are so busy flip-flopping between rage and mindless affection. Morris tries to write it in different voices, but the third-person narrative doesn't work for this. Any interesting characters (like Father Gannon or Renie LaChance) just get dropped. Feels like the author is vastly out of control of this book, and it doesn't feel like that was her intention. Even the few good sections get drowned out. I read the whole thing, hoping that someone would learn something, and I was very disappointed to find that not a single person in the book changes at all. What a long story to tell about people who never learn or grow or change. The bad news is that it will probably get made into a movie."
1,Boring,"I was not planning to review this book as I am still trying to make my way through it (I am approximately 3/4's of the way through it and am determined to finish) however, I was reading through the other reviews and saw several which said that the people who don't like this book only want ""happy"" books and don't enjoy good literature, etc. I feel compelled to say that while it is a dark and gloomy book, the real problem is that it is boring. It fails to hold your attention. I started this book in the middle of October and have had to force myself to read it. It is taking forever. This book is the story of a mean, dysfunctional mother who can't be nice to her own children (for their own good, of course) and yet seems to be blindingly trusting of the only con man in town. None of the characters are likeable, including most of the children. Do yourself a favor, don't read this book. While the story seems to have potential, it's just not worth the effort it takes to read."
2,Disappointing/Sad/Depressing,"I was so pleased to read other reviews of this novel that echoed my own opinions, formed while reading -- and ultimately throwing -- the book. While I understand the importance of the ""shared human experience"" this is not the type of story I want to read in the few precious quiet-time moments I have for reading. Where is entertainment, laughter, joy in this book? Marie may be strong but her life of unremitting disappointments and struggle and screaming at her children (what is that about?) is not what makes me happy to belong to the family of man. Sorry I agree with another reviewer who said this may be my last Oprah recommended read"
1,Who are these people?,"I cannot believe that I actually finished this book. I will admit that it was somewhat well written, or I would not have gotten to the third chapter. The characters were so annoying. I could not relate to them, nor did I even want to get to know them. I just kept thinking that the book HAD to get better, and I am sad that I was so wrong"
3,2 weeks to get to nothingness,"I have read all of Oprah Winfrey's books she has recommended during her Book Club. I think after this one, I'm going to stop. This was long, drawn out reading to finally get to an ending that wasn't. I was disappointed. The story itself could have been condensed and the ending elaborated on"
3,Did I Miss Something?,"OK, I admit...I'm not a literary genius! In fact (shudder) I even read for pleasure. But I failed to find the deep meaning in this novel. For me, Songs in Ordinary Time was..well, ordinary.The book provided a colorful and intriguing description of life in a small town. But, I found it really difficult to have any sympathy for Marie. I'm certain it was a struggle raising three children, on a limited income, as a single mother. Wait, was this novel set in 1997?The only character to arouse my sympathy was Benjy. I'd love to be his mother!!"
2,Songs in Ordinary Time,"This is not a great book by any means; the characters have very few redeeming qualities and for the most part you don't really like them. But, strangely, I was drawn to finish this book to see what happened. I could not read it for very long without having to put it down, though, because the characters and their existences are so depressing. I was especially disturbed by the mother, Alice, who can't seem to see that her troubles are of her own making, and who psychologically and verbally abuses her children. The whole Presto Soap scam was so implausible that I felt certain that Morris must have had some other intention in dragging it on for so long. You kept hoping that Alice would get some sense and finally see what was going on. Her youngest son, Benjy most depicted the result of Alice's psychological and verbal abuse on the children; very scary. All in all, I have to say that it was a fascinatingly disturbing read."
1,The Absolute Worst,"This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. The characters were all weak, mean, stupid, deceitful, or a combination of all of these. Not one of the characters was in any way appealing. It was a real waste of time .... I threw it away because I didn't want to contribute anyone else's being taken in by Oprah's recommendation. This book caused me to decide that Oprah must not read the books she recommends."
4,A Touching Slice of Life,"I was so suprised to see so many negative reviews for this book. I enjoyed it immensely. The author creates characters so real I felt like I really knew Marie and her children. I will concede that the book was somewhat depressing, but at the same time I found it so engrossing and lyrical that I could not put it down. For a book to elicit such feeling--be it depression or not, is a credit to a gifted author with a special ability to touch her readers. Benjie tore at my heart strings and I feel the better person for it!"
1,Awful,"I just saw all these reviews and I must say that I am very happy to see that I am NOT the only one who thought the book was/and still is (I haven't finished it yet) a boring, depressing read. For the past couple of years, I've picked up the book over and over again, just to make it only to page 120. I've come to realize that about 120 pages is all I can take on reading about other peoples' depressing lives. Maybe one day I'll finish it.........probably not."
5,A great book any way you look at it.,"I truly enjoyed this book and I am sorry it is finished, I cared for this family and as the plot thickened I grew increasinly uneasy about their possible futures. I was frightened for Marie and her children. I was almost afraid to turn the pages at one point. There are more families like this than we would believe, stuggling against the odds and someway finding a way to go on the next day and the next week and the next year.As for the ending it was realistic, I did not feel let down but relieved there would be another day for them. I also enjoyed Dangerous Woman and plan to read Vanished"
5,Far from Ordinary,"Initially, Songs In Ordinary Time seems to be confusing--a mass of characters and relationships that are difficult to connect to one another. However, as the reader is drawn more deeply into the novel, he/she begins to recognize Morris' uncanny ability to expose individual lives in relation to a collective soul. At times reminiscent of Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio, Morris' story delves into the consequenses of lapses in communication, the intricate connection of individuals' experiences in small town America, and the results of poor decisions and misspent lives. What marks the novel as extraordinary is the author's amazing ability to make the reader an intimate part of so many diverse lives and emotions. Experiencing feelings ranging from joy to sorrow, rage to apathy, no reader will emerge from the experience unchanged. Songs In Ordinary Time is the story of unfortunate circumstances and the ability of the individual to rise above them and find the joy in the everyday"
3,"slow moving, but interesting","When I first started reading this book, I thought Oprah was out of her mind. It takes awhile to get anywhere..and I am still not sure where it went..the only part of the book I enjoyed was the relationship between Marie and her children. I felt everyone's frustration. I wished that Marie hadn't been so gullible"
3,Engaging but wouldn't recommend it to others,"I very much enjoyed the writing style and the characters but it completely left me hanging. I like closure. I like to feel that I've learned something when I've finished the book. Anyone from a small town can relate to a lot of the feelings in the book, but it does seem that it was all set in 1997 - not 1960. Maybe the book would have been too long if Ms. Morris decided to draw any conclusions and so she just decided to write a sequel"
4,Songs in Ordinary Time,"I find myself joining the horde of readers following Oprah's recommendations [I just loved Stones From The River].Songs in Ordinary Time drew me in to the Fermoyle family saga and their quest for an identity they could triumph over, and then it left me flat with its unclimactic ending. I don't expect every book to discard the black cloud of despair and reveal a glimmer of hope at its conclusion, but for me Ms. Morris built a staircase of hope, false as it might have been and stunted me with the reality that not all things in life are stitched at the seams with a silver lining. I personally am not used to books leaving me feeling empty and sad, though I now realize this was Ms. Morris' subliminal intention [thanks to Cardinal15's astute review]."
1,A horrible waste of time,"This book is one of the worst I've ever read. Somehow the storyline does not hang together so the reader is compelled to finish this very long, surprisingly dull book. Do yourself a favor, read something else!"
1,the unfinished novel,"No this book did not leave off unfinished, well it may have, I'll never know since I cannot bring myself to pick it up again and I'm only about halfway through it. One reviewer said if you could stick it out through the first 150 pages you'd be glad, but I felt that reaching that point did not signify any speeding up of the story after it's sloooow start. The only reason I stuck it out as long as I did was due to a lack of anything else to read at the time, but since I have replenished my reading materials, I feel no need to continue further. This book is miserable and stays that way. I can't imagine even wanting to see a happy ending for it, as the characters being so miserable themselves make them very unlikeable for me. I like escaping into the lives of ordinary people, but not to become miserable, I need no book to do that. If you're looking for something along those lines try Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres, but avoid this book if, well, just avoid it really."
3,"Despite all its flaws, a readable book","I really, really wanted to dislike this book. Few of the characters were likeable, there were far more subplots than necessary, and as a previous reader noted, it could have easily been 300 words shorter. But somehow, the story of a small town in 1960, with all its meandering plots, its residents' twisted lives, secrets, desires, and blind spots, pulled me along. As unlikeable as the characters were, they were believable, and ultimately, that is what kept me going through 740 pages. At least they were 740 relatively fast pages. The one exception to the believablity quotient was that Norm, after 650 pages of hating Omar Duval, suddenly fell under his spell for about 50 pages. The sudden change of heart made no sense and seemed entirely plot driven. At least Norm did come to his senses pretty quickly!"
2,Uh....,"I only managed to get about a chapter and a half into this book. I set it down to answer the hpone, and never bothered to pick it back up. It just didn't grab me, I didn't care about any of the characters enough to want to read any further."
1,Just one more disappointed reader,"I cannot recommend this book to anyone. I didn't like a single character. At best the characters are weak and pathetic; at worst, they're vile. I kept hoping that someone in the book would grow into a person I could admire. By the end, none of the characters has grown. They're all still pathetic people that I would never want to know in real life. This book was a thorough waste of time."
2,The best description is zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.,"I admit, I read to escape, I read for entertainment. Oprah's books are full of the most dysfunctional people ever. Such depressing charactors. Songs just adds to her litany of boring, depressing stories full of dysfunctional people. I never thought it would end, but was glad when it did."
1,Songs in Ordinary Time -A long dreary book,"I devoted a week to reading the 740 pages of this book. I can't remember when I was more disappointed by an author particularty one selected by Oprah's book club. The book is without a character with redeeming qualities and filled with despair and self pitying adults who continue theit self-destructive bahaviors without acknowledging them . Even the children fail to engender any sympathy or much pity. The few characters the reader has some hopeful feelings for ( Sam,Blue,Norm) are left incomplete by the author. Mary McGarry Morris has written a depressing book."
1,What was the point?,"I'm an avid reader so I don't give bad reviews (like I'm about to give) lightly. I haven't read all the books in the Oprah book club, but I've read a number of them and this is by far the worst selection. Compare this book to greater books like Stones From the River by Ursula Hegi, Song of Solomon by Toni Morrison, and Ellen Foster by Kaye Gibbons and you'll see what I mean: negative characters with little or no redeeming qualities in a story that meanders from pointless situation to pointless situation. The only emotion I registered was boredom and I left the book wondering ""Why did I bother?"". I understand the premise of the title ""Songs in Ordinary Time"" meaning that we'll look at the smaller more ordinary moments of life and not at great achievements or transcendence. A little hope would have been nice but even that wasn't necessary. Ordinary moments can be illuminating in fiction but that was simply not accomplished in this dull, lifeless novel."
2,Apparently I'm not the only one who was disappointed!,"When I chose this book, I thought ""Great! Oprah likes it. I respect her opinion."" But what a disappointment. The story-line was fragmented and the prose unremarkable. It appeared to me that the author, in trying to develop this ""cast of thousands"" into multi-faceted characters, was only able to manufacture caricatures of real people. The entire book seemed superficial and unreal. In the end, I had to force myself to finish reading this tome. At first I thought perhaps I had missed something, but, I see from the other reveiws that I am not alone. Phew!"
3,The jury is still out!,"Finished this one yesterday-and have mixed feelings which may be the one redeeming feature of this long and sometimes depressing story. Am I really disgusted with these people? Or is is just that after such a long and arduous journey the author seemed at a loss as to how to finally end it. I appreciate the complexity of their lives and struggles, but there are just too many lives and too few successes-not to say too much screaming. And I must take issue with the other reviewers who claim that those of us who question the whole thing should stick to Danielle Steele-rather presumptuous, dont you think? I am extremely well read as I am sure are others-perhaps I might recommend something by Reynolds Price or Wallace Stegner? Bye bye Oprah-after Rapture of Canaan and this one I believe I'll select my own."
1,Depressing!,"I wanted to believe Oprah, she has such good taste! But all I felt after finally finishing this book was depression. It was a good story with interesting characters, and Ms. Morris did an excellent job of weaving them throughout the story, but there was no triumph, no lasting impression of what the book was about. I didn't expect a fairy-tale ending, but I did expect a purpose for the book being written, and for me reading it. This book made me feel like I had wasted time reading it expecting to learn something"
2,Terrible Negative characters..Doomsday writing..,Characters all negative..book fizzled out at the end..nothing said about the 2 sons and their problems..and how they were helped..only daughter entering college..but with what money when mother was without monies..book just didnt hold up..only sorrow and misiry all the way through..very depressing to read..won't read any more of her books
1,A Depressing Vicious Cycle,"A clear depiction of how the average person deals with negative situations. In this book, they learn nothing from experience and continually spiral downward. I continued reading, thinking the situations would improve. They worsened. I completed the book but only because I prefer to finish what I start. This story is depressing, frustrating and annoying in the lack of intelligence given to or shown in the characters."
2,Songs in Ordinary Time is a waste of time,"The author tries to explore too many characters indepth and it doesn't work for her readers, or maybe it just doesn't work for me. I found the plot to be tedious, the characters too predictable, and the novel itself too long. She could have have a good novel if she hadn't tried to include the whole town's point of view!"
1,The Worst Book I Have Ever Read,If only there were ZERO stars to award a selection.This book took HUNDREDS of pages and many hours out of my lift to say next to nothing. Characters who offered a glimmer of hope slipped and fell back into the abyss. I am astounded at all the favorable reviews this awful book has gotten from amazon readers.Just because a book is long and boring doesn't mean it's good.
1,Get a Life!,"I could not fininsh this book. Each time I picked it up to continue to read, I wanted to throw the book through a window. The mother needed to get a life. She put her misery onto her children, and insisted on believing in lies. To be honest, I could not finish it. It is currently holding up my computer monitor."
3,Glad to be finished,"This book had a very touching story to be told but the author would go on and on to get to the point. Trudi, the main character, was a courageous child who became a strong, giving adult. I wish something nice or wonderful would have happened in her life at some point. This book depicts the Holocaust Era like no other fiction I have ever read, but again I think the author throws in words just to make this book almost too long for anyone to finish. The book gets better around page 275 but up intil then you have to convince yourself over and over to keep going."
1,I thought I was losing it!,"Two weeks ago I read some of the reviews and decided I must be reading a different book, but today I see others had some of the same problems I did with this long , depressing book with no end. I also finished it because something good had to happen, but of course it never did. Except maybe for the author who will undoubtedly write a sequel. Count me out. I don't care what happens to the Fermoyles. The book club I belong to has the same general opinion. Some do appreciate the fine writing, but the question remains why. Why did she write it and why did I spend so much time reading it"
3,Agonizingly long and slow moving!,"This book could have made all the same points in about 250 pages. Deception and duplicity pervade every character to the point of numbness. They are paralyzed by each other. I feel that Morris leaves a lot of loose ends. At the very end, I felt that the author was given a deadline and just threw the ending together to get the manuscript in on time. I won't recommend this book to any of my friends. It's tiresome"
4,Great book.,"Captivating, realistic, couldn't put it down till the end. I only wish it had a stronger ending."
3,Disappointed,"Although difficult at the beginning to get into, I did find myself wanting to see what was going to happen next. I truly expected things to get better for Marie & her kids....but much to my disappointment that was not achieved...... I was also disappointed in Oprah selecting this as one of her ""Book Club"" recommendations."
2,Had hoped for better,"I would never have written a review on this book until I read what others had felt. I felt that I was totally inadequate to do so because I was sure that something must be wrong with me since I found this a hard book to want to read. From page one I found it difficult to follow and it took a while to figure out exactly who the characters were and how they related. Not to mention, why they were even discussed! I did, however, finish the book but only to be disappointed in the ending because of it's so unbelievable finish. For such a long story, it certainly had a hurry-up ending. I have read all of Oprah's bookclub list and only hope that the next selection has a lot more substance"
5,I absolutely loved this book,I found the characters in this book rich and realistic. I knew a Omar Duvall and Mary Garris Moore obviously has too. I found the ending disappointing until I put the book down and thought about what my reaction to the turmoil of Marie's life would of been - I would have thrown my head back and laughed too. If you read only for entertainment and a fairytale ending this book is not for you. If you have known hardship and alchoholism it will grab you. Beware - Pollyanna
1,Smell does not last,"Easy to install and smells really nice once out of the package, but it carries the small though the AC for about half an hour. Waste of money."
1,Useless,"The gel smells really nice when you unpack it, yes. After installation, the AC carries the smell for about 30 min... Really disappointing!!! I would return if I could!"
3,Great while it lasts!,"This air conditioner freshener will make your entire house smell great, but the smell doesn't last more than two days. I enjoyed the product because it didn't require much to install and it doesn't overpower your home. I think that this product will do the job if you only want your home to be extra fresh for your guests."
1,Lame product,"I hanged this on my air return and I couldn't smell anything. Also, as the gel shriveled up, little pieces fell on the floor where my kids and dog could touch it or eat it."
2,Love them but to much money,These work good in my house roughly about two weeks or more but I found them at my local wal mart for 2 dollars. So i think they need to come down on there pricing
2,Wrong product,I thought it was a scented filter. Not a scented pad to put on a filter. It is too cheap to return.
3,Lasts 1 week,"The main problem with this product as already pointed out by other people is that it lasts only a week. If you live in a small apartment, the smell will be very intense. You might consider to divide it in four parts in that case. I did so."
3,Limited Life,I agree with the other poster. It was strong (really strong) within minutes after i put it in. After a few days it dissipated pretty quickly. If you need something to ensure that every room in your house smells good and need it for only a week or so (maybe a party or house guests) this would be a good idea. At a minimum you will need to change this every 2-3 weeks which will get expensive.
4,Gardenia is their best scent IMHO,"Love this scent. It is strong for the first 3 days and is minimal for a few more, unfortunately. I wish they had something that would last longer."
4,Good for beginners sort of,The book is very organized and informative sometimes it grazes the structure of typical organized religion but it is a good stepping stone for beginners. I find it's a good book if you want to learn how to practice but as for the history of wicca it only delves in a little.
2,Earth Magic,"The title of this book is very misleading. It has very little to do with the Earth at all. I was very disappointed because I was expecting it to focus more on Mother Earth. If you are looking for a book on Mother Earth and nature, this probably isn't the book for you."
5,Perez Reverte- Maestro of mystery,"This unique mystery by Perez-Reverte yet again demonstrates his ability to combine beautifully descriptive imagery with a plot that is intellectual and gripping. Amidst the political turmoil of late 19th century Madrid stands Jamie Astarloa, fencing instructor of noblemen and fighter of lost causes. When he is reluctantly made the central link of a conspiracy, Don Jaime is forced to fight for the old ideals he still believes in. This is one more in the descriptive style of the Seville Communion. The plot is not as intricate as the Club Dumas or Flanders panel but still brilliant nonetheless- ends fantastically. A must read for anyone wanting an escape from the standard crime format."
5,Really good read,"Although I am late to the party, this book has already been well reviewed many times, I still wanted to put in my two cents. It is a great little book. The two principle characters are fascinating, there is only one really large suspension of disbelief, and, at the end you care about what has happened. It is helpful to know something of fencing, after all that word in the title is why I bought the book, but not essential. The book is a character study in the finest sense of the phrase, not a fencing manual.If you have a three hour plane ride - this is a perfect companion, unless you read slowly and find that you missed your stop."
5,"Great Book, lots of action scenes involving fencing","This book is a great page-turner, especially for those interested in fencing."
3,a mystery thriller that has you guessing til the end.,"A well written novela, gives historical insight to the changing of the guard in 19th century Spain. A very relaxing read that entangles the reader with curiosity of each character. Three seperate mysteries are solved within the text. I would like to have had a glossary of fencing terms to identify some of the verbage within the book. I throughly enjoyed this novel."
3,Fencing,"Although the ending to this novel seems rushed,in my opinion, the build up to the final confrontation was cleverly done and left the reader with no clue until near the end who the prime subjects really were,though the final fencing pair were obvious. The author clearly understood the art of fencing. The cafe scenes could have been more political and the hero surprisingly naive for his advanced years. All told,a good read and hard to put down."
2,More Boring Than Expected,"This is the fourth book I have read by this author, and it is the most boring. The book is rather thin in overall character - the plot is rather simple and there is little to no suspense in this so-called mystery. Perhaps someone interested in Spanish fencing masters of the mid to late 1800's or interested in Spain would be more moved by this book. I was just looking for a good read - and this was not it."
4,A novel of texture.,"Arturo P√©rez-Reverte's 1988 novel, mystically casts interesting lights and shadows on the characters of Don Jaime Astarloa, the aging yet regal fencing master and the femme-fatale, Do√±a Adela de Otero. The story's uncomplicated thread of historical cause-and-effect regarding Spain's social and political mores of the period will keep the reader captivated. Don Jaime, lives to some degree, in all of us."
3,Not his best but VERY good!!!,"Fun to read story set in 19th century Spain , with a strong plot and elderly fencing master who can't fit modern times as an old school honorable gentleman . No esothery here, boys and girls."
4,The Woman and the Sword,"Again Perez-Reverte has created a wonderful novel full of creativity and rich in history. During a time when chivalry and honor are at their end, a single man exists that still remembers and lives in the times of the past. Unfortunately this man is forced to live in the times of the present by unknowingly have been a part of a plot that includes murder and the monarchy of Spain. The cunning and charming exploits of a woman, a woman who has the knowledge of the sword, are enough for him to reveal one of the most powerful and secret sword thrusts known to the art. With a surprising end and the discovery that the fencing master has been searching for all his life, this tale ends with a calm and serene victory over evil and fencing."
3,"Nice, but P√©rez-Reverte can do better","Nice book, but I think that a writer as P√©rez-Reverte can do much better: as seen in ""The Seville Communion"" and ""The Club Dumas""."
2,"thin, wan, weak fluff","This book was easy to read and follow, which is great for light reading on the way home or at bedtime. But I find the glowing reviews on quality of the content, style and translation astounding, considering how one-dimensional the characters were, and how flimsy the plot. For starters, sharing more specific intrigues of the political crisis would have made the novel and certainly the wrap-up more satisfying."
2,"Nice story, could have been better.","The Fencing Master is a nicely conceived story, with a beginning,a middle and an end. Unfortunatley the middle comes about 90% of the way through the book, long after you've stopped looking for it. The ending is then too abrupt and the conflict not well developed enough. This could have been a great book. Truly great. But as it is, it is only okay. Great fencing scenes which make one want to learn how to do it. If only there were a fencing master of great quality around."
4,A splendid book -- Perez-Reverte's debut,"Actually, THE FENCING MASTER is Arturo Perez-Reverte's first book -- not his latest. He wrote it before THE FLANDERS PANEL, THE CLUB DUMAS, and THE SEVILLE COMMUNION. It is a wonderful book, far more than a murder mystery; a character study, crafted with meticulous attention to historical detail and the complexities of human emotion."
5,Another wonderful accomplishment by Arturo Perez-Reverte,"To write a review that does The Fencing Master justice one wishes for the talent of Perez-Reverte. Beautifully crafted as all his books are, the Fencing Master draws you into the life of Don Jaime until you find yourself walking straighter and feeling for the sword at your side! So clearly does the author define the art, that you find yourself thinking like a fencer joining Don Jaime in trying to solve the mystery like a fencing match. Characters jump off the page into your life. No book by Mr. Reverte ever disappoints, this one is no exception."
5,A Jewel,"I was impressed by this uncomplicated and poetic treatment of a man whose profession has become obselete. What a message for those who ponder the meaning of it all when their society doesnt need them anymore. P-R takes an intentionally simple story line and paints it like a Velazquez portrait.One should feel that something has been learned after reading a novel, and I feel that I have a better sense of the Spanish mind and its values of tradition, pride, and discipline."
2,A dissappointment,"I fell in love with The Flanders Panel, enjoyed The Club Dumas and The Seville Communion, but the latest from this author has me scratching my head: was he forced by his publisher to quickly churn out another novel? Did he run out of ideas after writing several good novels in a row? While he accurately evokes the spirit of the times, I found the reading tedious, with no apparent plot until about 150 pages. Even then, the plot is very thin, and the politics that are described, and around which the plot centers, are described so sketchily that one doesn't really care what happens to these people. I found myself turning the page not because it was so good, but because I was hoping that any minute now it must be getting better. After turning the last page, I unfortunately realized that this would not be the case. This book will make me think twice about rushing out to buy the next book of Arturo Perez Reverte. Sorry."
2,Not worth it,"I could not find a description of the product and I did not realize that the candle is made with water and oil. The bottle of oil in the package was leaking and was nearly half empty. My son was happy anyway because this is his personality, but I was not happy with this purchase."
1,Worthless,"The plastic ""wick"" melted on top, I would have had better results burning the money in a jar than spending it on this product."
3,"Badly organized, chaotic, and not all that terrifying!","Let me clarify - the crimes detailed here are horrifying, but the author's way of relating the tale is almost boring. I found myself skimming large portions of the book, and no, I wasn't looking for the ""gross parts."" Unless I'm totally missing something, it seems that the stories of multiple victims of this monster are left completely untold. The author seems to mention only a few in any more than passing. I just think this book is sort of a big mess, as if different people wrote each chapter."
2,this book was not that great,"I found this book to be pretty disappointing. It seemed poorly organized and lacked good ""flow"". There are some details here but they are all jumbled up and not very powerful in the end. After seeing the Hard Copy story on these two nuts, I was scared & slightly curious. After reading this book, I am just disappointed. Hard Copy did it more effectively in 13 minutes. Sorry, this one's a strike out in my opinion. I reccommend Philip Carlo's ""Night Stalker"" or anything by Harold Schechter instead. These guys know how to write."
2,Die For Me,"The book was not that great. It goes on and on, but doesn't get into the details when they murder the victim. I like more of the step by step process of the killings. I've read better."
1,Poor quality,"I'm an avid true crime reader & was looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, the author never connects you to the character. Their manner of writing seemed textbook like. With the exception of 2 victims, they totally left out what happened with the other victims. I couldn't finish the book, it just wasn't worth my time. IMHO, it's a waste of paper. I wouldn't waste your money on it. You'll only be disappointed."
3,Scary What Fate Can Do,"I am not a big fan of true crime books. Most read just like the True Detective magazine stories. I guess when you are writing about true life crimes probably based mainly on court records, trial transcriptions and newspaper articles it is bound to come out with a textbook feel to it and in fairness to the author here he is not as textbook as others I have read. The scary part of this book is that something as simple as placing an ad in the paper to sell stereo equipment can lead to your death. Overall an interesting read."
2,"Little on Detail, Big on Boring","I love true crime and that's probably the only thing that kept me reading this book. This book provides very little detail on the actual crimes and concentrates more on how Ng was a sadistic, manipulating know-it-all that liked to play games, but didn't like the consequences of such.I generally can read a good true crime book in 48 hours or less, but this one took me almost a week. Instead of forsaking everything else to read; this time I read when there was nothing else to do."
2,A Little boring,I decided to read this book after seeing a documentary on TV about Ng and Lake. The book was a little borning and took me over 2 weeks to finish it {lost interest}. Some parts of the book did keep my interest and worth the read but not quite as much as I had hoped.
5,"Scratched, but still awsome!!!","This toy is great!!! The detail on the figure Is exactly Like In the movie! The paint job isn't exactly perfect, and his muscles look wierd somtimes when you pose him. But all in all, this is a great toy. Spidey fans: this is reccomended"
5,Spider-Man,We are pleased with the purchase.The product corresponded to our expectation.We recommended to all interested in the same !!!
5,Twins love it,"I have twin three year old boys, and they love Spiderman. This is a great action figure, it is extremely poseable and the perfect size for little hands. The only thing that I wish is that it was a little easier for the boys to attach it to the ""stand"" that it comes with, I have to help them with it."
5,The best I've heard in a long time...,"I've always been a fan of Abba but I've also always been a fan of Bananarama. I've only heard a few songs but all of them are good. A personal favourite of mine, the remake of 'Waterloo' is pretty much my motive in buying this. A definate for Abba fans as far as I think..."
2,pointless,"The existence of this album just goes to show how unique was ABBA's sound, because none of the covers on this album remotely approach it. The most creatively satisfying are the two versions of Dancing Queen, although as another reviewer has said: you should have used the full version of Bridal Dancing Queen!! It's a spectacular arrangement, unlike the dross on the rest of A Tribute. The Swedish version - The Tribute (1992) - is far more consistently interesting."
2,MEDIOCRE- NOT WORTHY OF ABBA,"My Love, My Life"" by Bike, should have been included as the #1 song on this album. It is perhaps the best tribute song to ABBA ever made. The songs on this album are poor, with the exception of Erasure's version of ""Take a Chance on Me"", (Lemonheads)Evan Dando's version of Knowing Me Knowing You, and Muriel's Wedding ""Dancing Queen"" instrumental. For fans of ABBA, at least Frida and The Real Group (a Swedish acapella group)sing a unique verion of ""Dancing Queen"". The rest on the album is trash!"
3,"Points for trying, points taken away for failing.","I personally like this CD. Unfortunately the spirit of ABBA is lost by some of those so-called artists out there. Some honorable mentions are E-Rotic's ""Money, Money, Money"" Bananarama's ""Waterloo"" and CoCo Lee's take on ""Dancing Queen."" Evan Dando's version of ""Knowing me, knowing you"" is mediocore, as well as Ash's ""Does your mother know."" The songs aren't bad, it's just, it sounds like the singers aren't even trying very hard. Some of the tracks sound like they were made in a matter of minutes, while others have careful attention paid to every vocal arrangement. That is why I scored the CD as 3 stars. Some songs are great, some aren't. It's a case of: either you like it, or you hate it. Which is a shame, because ABBA is a group that needs to be celebrated, just not like this. Anyway, I would rather spend the same amount of money on an actual ABBA album, than compared to this CD. Honestly, ABBA has so much more to offer."
4,A real mixed bag,"This album is a strange mix of Abba covers, some easily available and many not so. Whilst some of the early tracks feature on the Swedish Abba tribute album we are soon moved on to other interesting takes. The highlights for me are Sofia and Michael B Tretow's ""Honey, Honey"" and, like many of the other reviewers, The Real Group & Frida's acapella ""Dancing Queen"" - a true gem. A shame that a few of the tracks are too similar to Abba's orginal versions to be interesting. The sound quality is generally good although I'm rather mystified by the crackling throughout Mike Love's ""On And On And On"" which makes it sound like it has been sourced from vinyl. Sloppy editing of Magnus Palm's liner notes leads us to believe the CD includes Svenne & Lotta's ""He Is Your Brother"" which is in fact exclusive to the cassette release (a blatant marketing gimmick as there is plenty of space for this on the CD). All in all, though, quite a good compilation which I would recommend to all Abba fans."
5,Breathtaking!,"This is P√§rt like we have not heard him before: bold and expressive, yet still thoughtful and meditative. As long as I have been listening to his music, as familiar as I thought I was with his style, I simply was not prepared for this recording, which is stunningly impressive.Things start off in familiar form, with the Hilliard Ensemble intoning Da Pacem Domine, which sounds like you might expect for a vocal piece by Aarvo P√§rt. Very nice stuff.Then, bam! Lamentate blasts forth from your speakers, and you find your breath taken away by the power of P√§rt's musical vision. With pounding percussion and blazing brass, this is no exercise in quiet minimalism. Pianist Alexei Lubimov plays expressively, even tenderaly in places, and there are moments of quiet introspection; still, Lamentate is a powerful piece, the most powerful piece that P√§rt has ever penned. This new release is a must-audition for lovers of contemporary classical music."
4,A Delightful Read!,"What a charming book. I was wandering through the library, looking for something to read when I picked up Bobby's Girl. The blurb on the back, which by the way is wrong, looked interesting. According to it, Kathy the alien, was here on Earth hiding from her enemies, and no one on Earth knew that she was an alien. The reality is much more interesting. Her friends know that she is from another world, but they love her so much, they just don't care. They help her settle in to a life in LA and are prepared to defend her. The book is engaging and humorous. I read it in a single sitting, and boy is my behind tired! :-))).I would recomend this to anyone looking for something a little different."
2,Aggressively mediocre,"It takes a lot for me to choose not to finish a book, even one this short. I just couldn't care about this story or the characters in it. Way too much happens to the main character way too easily. Surgically altered to look human and dropped onto an alien planet, she's taken in by the sweetest, nicest people who ever lived, and then falls into a high-paying Hollywood job (non-union shoot, apparently).I think the author forgot that characters need to struggle in a story."
4,DJ Rogers Beula Jean,"This message is for Camille Brooks, who's been searching for Beula Jean on DJ Roger's album. It's a hard search, but my son found it downtown around 42nd Street at a record shop, (sorry I didn't get the name, but I too have to go seaching for it again because it was taken) but.....the name of the album which I had in cassette was D. J. Rogers, ""Say you Love Me"" by Old School Series, Soul Classics it was digitally remastered but sounded great to me.....I'm on a mission to find it again because he is one of the best soul singers around, and Beula Jean is one of the most soulful, heart-stirring records to date.....wish you luck and hope you find it. Also try DownStairs Records"
4,Great Find,"My Dad suggested that I get this cd and give it a try and he was right. I had never even heard of this guy, but this was a ""great find""! The cd is worth the purchase if you like good music and lyrics."
4,A Must Listen Too,I really enjoyed listening to this music again. Its not on the music being sold on the current compilation albums
2,Not for Use wtih Intel-Macs,"Nice looking keyboard but fairly useless with Intel-based Macs as there are no drivers for it. E-mail from Macally (November 2007) states that Macally ""has no plans to make Intel driver for this keyboard"". $35 down the drain."
1,Lack of information.,I ordered this item not knowing that it was for MACs only. A little more information on this product would have saved me a lot of time and trouble.
5,Totally Awesome,"For those who only thought they were Mott The Hoople fans! Until you experience the raw power of Ariel Bender's guitar live, you will never understand the extent to which they influenced the following onslaught of the Punk Era. This album is raw energy highlighting the best rock band in the world at it's very peak. While Ian is horse through some of disc two, the music more than makes up for this shortfall. They don't make music like this any more, and it's a shame!"
3,"43"" clamps will only handle a 40"" panel, the 49"" will only handle a 46"" panel.","Note before you buy:I bought the 43"" clamps thinking they will glue up a 42"" top. Wrong. The max width you can glue is about 40"". You would think as I did the 43"" are for 42"" widths, the 49"" clamps are for 48"" widths.No where on Planos Color PDF Brochure do they state how wide a panel they will glue up.I think its misleading calling out 43"" clamps that will only clamp 40"". Or 49"" clamps that will only clamp up a 46"" panel. Whats the point of the 43"" or 49"" name."
4,"Works well, but a bit pricey","As with all Quick-Grip products, the only thing wrong with the Powerpress is its price. The clamps work very well, and it's great being able to position them anywhere on the bar - you don't have a bunch of pipe hanging off one side of your project. The built-in pads are fairly effective, but they will dent soft woods if you really crank them down. Even with a 3-foot bar, the clamps are a bit heavy, but they provide plenty of pressure and are easy to re-position."
4,A very wonderful book about a close relationship with 2 sons,"This book is about a black man and the close day to dayrelationship with his 2 sons. It shows the need for a father to be arole model in their children's life on a daily basis. It is a subtil story teaching the values of having a father you can look up to, the kicker being that the father is 6' 9"" !"
5,No brown spots in the lawn!,"We have used this product for 4 years now, and I can tell you that it works - we have a 65 lb. german shepherd that could be ruining the lawn, but it's as green as can be..."
5,Unimaginably Manly,"I grew thirty miles of beard when I read this. It took me weeks to crawl out of the tangle, but with The Alphabet of Manliness as my survival guide, the wild was no match for my masculinity."
5,This Review Needs No Title.,"If you shave and then read this book, you will immediately grow a beard rivaling that of two members of ZZTop. This book is that miraculous and awe-inspiring. However, if you're a politically correct piece of trash who's not even worthy of the airspace you've been allotted by the almighty Chuck Effing Norris, you will immediately die."
3,Crudely funny,"Lots of easy-to-take-offense-at comments about women, but surely no one can actually have that attitude today (or can they.) Or at least live to tell about it (much less write about it.) Lots of vulgarity and scatalogical humor, too. Author has an acerbic sense of humor that is very funny in small doses. Not recommended to be read cover to cover in a short time, though."
5,A+++ Work,"This is the best book I have ever seen in my life. I have yet to read it, yet its manliness and awesomeness radiates from it. No one, not even God himself could ever write a book even close to one-sixth as good as this book! Infinite thumbs up, A eternal +, etc."
5,AMAZING.,"All I can say that as a woman, this was so much fun to read. Absolutely hilarious. Would recommend it to anyone (especially my feminist friends)."
4,Review - The Alphabet of Manliness,"Well, what can you really say? Anyone who knows Maddox's work will certainly enjoy this book, and it's definately packs a punch to the ovaries for people who pick it up just for a browse. Crude, direct, and well written, Maddox delivers his particular brand of humour with his usual panache. Although it seems to be slightly more tame than his website, I just put that down to publisher constraints. One thing I did miss was the old fashioned ""MS Paint"" artwork that Maddox uses in his posts. Although the professional artwork was done well, I think it took a little something away, and in conjunction with my previous point, it loses a star in this review.I'll never look at my alphabet soup the same way again."
2,Childish,I bought this after I stumbled upon Maddox's website.I thought the idea of him paying and running his own website was pretty cool. I also enjoyed his wacky opinions.This book is pretty childish. Rude words are funny as a kid but you get used to them as an adult.Buy this for a boy in primary school.
5,Hadoken!,Just to learn the proper technique for a Hadoken! ; this book is worth buying.ohh pitty the poor poor co-workers...for now they show know Fear!
3,"Love the web site, not so into the book...","I think ""The Best Page in the Universe"" is great, love it! I could go on and on here about the different things Maddox has written that I think are funny...but instead I will focus on this book. I got it from Amazon, and was excited to crack it open. However, I think it's a little too...oh no...juvenille (spelling...hhahahehae), and not quite as cleaver as A LOT of his other work/insights. Compared to his pieces on kid's art, immigrants, star wars, etc... this is less...""yay, right on!"" and more just toliet humor and silly. I guess I like Maddox for telling it like it is, and this is more just being dirty. So if you like toliet humor and sexual humor that borders on really silly, you'll probably like this book...for me I go to Robert Hamburger for that: down with the Pirates.SK"
2,For Suburban 16-year-olds.,"I am an avid reader of ""the Best Page in the Universe,"" and bought the book in Manhattan and had Maddox sign it, but I was disappointed. His website has actual satirical merit, but the book has very little. If you are a 16-year-old, with maybe two friends, from the Midwest, and feel spoiled yet sheltered by your parents, you would love this book. The jokes are disappointing, and the overhyped edginess never really comes through. The book could have just as easily been written by a second-rate writer for Mad Magazine. Save your money and take it out of the library when the time comes."
2,Overrated,"Honestly, even though he barely ever updates it, Maddox's website is much better than this book. I found the book to be a huge letdown. A lot of the content just wasn't that funny. I wouldn't recommend buying it."
2,Not that funny,"Okay I understand maddox has a strong loyal following, hell I used to be part of it, but he just isn't funny.Check out his website if you don't agree. He just wrote a new article today about macs, and it sucks. The last article he wrote in November, which sucked. Before that? July - sucked.The alphabet of manliness was completely hit and miss, some of the articles were hysterical (circa 2001 maddox) but a lot of it was just lame.Maybe someone can explain this to me, but how is it that he's so famous right now? He writes unfunny articles for his site, now every 4-6 months, publishes a mediocre book, and writes unfunny articles for cracked. There are writers on websites cranking out stories that are funny as hell on a weekly basis, but still people are hanging on to maddox."
3,Not as good as the website,Maddox is at his best when deriding something topical. I love his site but found this book to be predictable and boring. It's probably good for a laugh if you're a pre-teen boy though.
5,5 stars aren't enough for a truly pirate-worth book !,"-If you can't decide if you should buy the book, don't,because you are probably not ""man"" enough to read it!Infact, for reading this review, you should buy it as anappology for not trusting in the great art at first sight!Probably the best product that has left Idaho since itsestablishmentGreetings from Germany!- C.Grog"
5,Shockingly Offensive,"Base, crude, disgusting, and all other forms of horrible you can imagine;I LOVED IT!I just bought a second copy for my brother-in-law."
5,Maddox rolls on twenny foz,This is the greatest book ever written. It blows away other books such as the Bible. Read it.
4,"Great book, hilarious","This was a very funny book. I normally am not a big fan of books, but this one was very cool.Every chapter was great, the only problem was some chapters seem to be Maddox just trying to think of something that starts with that letter. Besides that, most of the chapters were really hilarious.For any fan of his website, this book is a must-buy. For those who have not seen Maddox's work, will be probably shocked at some of the stuff he says though I imagine.Anywho, a great book, I do recommend it."
5,Sun Tzu's Art of War has been talked about for ages. Maddox's book will be talked about even after the Sun burns out.,"This book is so amazing I even gave copies to my best friend, my worst enemy, a poodle and a rock. After reading it my best friend became my worst enemy (by simply saying he thought it was ""alright""), my worst enemy became my best friend because he tried beating me with this book. Sadly he didn't realize merely touching the pages of The Alphabet of Manliness will only strengthen a person, he turned me into a demigod. The poodle exploded instantly and the rock grew a pair and humped everything in site, including my ex-best friend. This book is so great you should read it to your children every night."
4,You read this book or I cut you. I cut you good!,"This book is really funny. There are some parts that just go on a bit longer than they should, but its still pretty funny. You really will enjoy this book which at its core is meant to make you laugh perhaps by being a bit too masochistic and over the top gender-racist.It gives you some points to ponder and is pretty much guaranteed to upset any and every kind of person imaginable on at least one page throughout the course of the book.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will be looking for similar ones. The author apparently has his own website which is in similar vein to this book which is now my new favorite website ever. Get this book you will not be disappointed."
5,this book is AWESOME!,This book has everything you need to know about being a man. It is the most humorous book I've ever read.
5,A is for Awesome,"It's not Manly to hate this book.While Maddox's crude humor styles will only catch the scorn of females, as the book title might suggest, this is geared towards guys, very sexist, crude, hairy, guys.The book itself is hillarious, and the pictures add to the humor.Worth the buy."
5,Pure Hilarity,This was one of the funniest books I've ever read. It's even better than his website and is all new material (unlike some web comedians that merely write a book re-hashing the same tired stories).
2,No where near as clever as the author's website,"I'm a firm believer that if the first chapter doesn't grab you, then the author doesn't deserve your attention. The first chapter about punching someone in the balls is material I laughed about in elementary school. Maddox is definitely in better form when he's writing scathing commentaries about popular trends (e.g. iPhones and Crocs), not this grade school garbage. I've been a huge fan of Maddox's site, but this book is no where near as clever as the writing on his website. Maddox should take his own advice and learn to self edit."
2,Not very manly,This book was only slightly fun to read while doing my business on the toilet. I was expecting more from the book.
2,Not Funny,"This book is offensive just to be offensive. It is nothing at all like other clever parodies of modern issues which this book strives for. Tries to make up for a lack of wit with crass. I don't mind crass humor at all, as long it has some wit to it, which this sorely and severely lacks."
2,Was expecting much more- great for 15 yr.old boys,Maddux is a funny guy- some of the stuff on is website is the best I've ever read.This book is disappointing. It's really just potty humor that's aimed at sophmoric 15 year old boys.
1,Wake me when it's over,"I picked up ""The Alphabet of Manliness"" on my way out of a bookstore as an impulse buy. I have to learn to curb my impulses. Once suspects that the author, Maddox, actually wrote this in the tenth or eleventh grade, saved the manuscript and corrected the language later, when he finally learned to spell words other than those that have four letters. A complete waste of time on the subject of manliness and masculinity. It's obviously designed to be over the top, crude, etc., but it's ultimately a depressing read and nothing you'll ever want to revisit. This is the book that sits on top of the toilet tank and eventually gets covered by catalogs from reproduction car model makers and the Nifty Nickel. I threw my copy in the trash, which seemed like a badass thing to do. If you must visit this subject matter, look for the ""Big Book of Sheer Damn Manliness"" by the Von Hoffman Bros. It predates this junk by a decade and is still funnier in every way."
1,Blows,"This book blows! When reading articles on The Best page in the Universe, I can't stop laughing even after reading the articles for the fifth and sixth times. This book however, has failed to make me laugh once. What happened Maddox?"
1,"Although this was restroom reading material, I still feel I've wasted my time.","If you're 12 years old this book probably seems hilarious. If you've been exposed to anything comical via television, internet, magazine etcetera you'll find this book to be a regurgitation of all the trendy ""funny"" topics of the past decade sprinkled with some unfunny classic-cliche-machismo garbage. This book is really a complete waste of time. I don't feel compelled to write a more comprehensive review and would suggest reading some of the more in-depth bashings posted by other users. Better yet, stick to the blog. It actually contains some intelligent humor. I say ""Up yours, Maddox,"" a statement sharing an equivalent lack of originality with your book."
3,M is for Misogyst,"Or [...]. You can't take this stuff at face value. It starts out pretty freakin' hilarious and then it goes to pretty freakin' offensive to pretty f@@#king stupid. This book nearly found its way to my trash can (not bookshelf material) but instead I'm going to give it away. If you are at all successful with women, this book is not for you. If you obsess about pirates, chuck norris and lumberjacks, you can't be getting laid."
1,What the...?,"I can't believe this dude who preached about shameless, self-promoting sell-outs has turned into one himself. And what's worse, is that his book isn't even good. If I could write a summary for the book it would go something like this, ""Me me me, me! Chuck Norris and me! yay me!"" The end..."
3,D is for Disappointed,"Ive read Maddox's site for years. I've laughed out loud with glee and sent articles and postings to all friends and family. He's not a constant updater, but I'm a constant checker, always checking away to find a new post. His website is gold.The Alphabet of Manliness is a different story. I'm 25 and this material isnt new information. Urinal etiquette? That's hilarious...in 1998. Chuck Norris-- a real knee slapper...back in mid-2005. All material just seems so dated and so not Maddox. The only piece I laughed out loud on was ""obedience."" I've already laughed at everything else when it was funny a long time ago."
5,Greatest Book Ever,"I have not read many books in my life as there are movies so books seem kinda outdated and boring to me, but out of the books i have read this is easily my favorite book of all time, its a great book for any man to read.....women will get offended (they cant handle this book)"
3,Good ... But not as good as the website,There are some funny things in the book but a lot of it has too much polish and lacks the spontanaeity and thus humor that Maddox's website offers. There's nothing surprising and nothing new to offer if you're familiar with Maddox's website. That isn't to say there isn't some funny bits of humor but I wouldn't spend 15 bucks on it ... borrow it from a library or skim through it at Borders or something.
5,The best damn book in the universe,"Metros and wimps read up, so Maddox can show you what a waste your life has been by not being a true man"
3,"Nah, not as neat as I thought","I would say check out his website first. The book isn't any better, makes a good bathroom book but in the end it's just silly. I knew that when I got it so don't really regret the purchase."
3,Eh...,"I was fortunate to nab a copy before the official release date. It's pretty funny in parts, but I had to skip right past ""N is for chuck Norris""...seriously, enough of the chuck norris [...]already. I would have to agree with the person who said the website was funnier. I still re-read a lot of articles on there. If he would have packaged those in a book and sold it, I would buy, just because you can never have too much tearing-apart-bad-movies and the ""looking for a safe stance on abortion? Me neither"" article has me pissing myself every time I read it.Book is alright, website is better."
4,Still hilarious,"This book is still funny even after the third time through. THough not as good as the website, its great in its own right. 'Cides, I think its time Maddox cashed in a bit."
5,The only book that won't bore you,"Awesome. The only word to describe this book is ""awesome."" From the erection at a sleep over to the lesbians, this book has everything. Tons of pictures, that would be funny enough to have a book of their own. Great buy."
5,"""A"" is for ""Almost Perfect""","I borrowed this one from a friend and laughed so hard I had to buy it. While a few of the entries at the end are less than great, hell, my face hurt after reading it the third time. Maddox has completely changed my views on lumberjacks and pirates. Mind you, some people will find this book offensive. Those people do not understand satire.Those people suck."
3,Not bad...,"I enjoyed reading this book as I've been reading Maddox's rants and raves for a few years now. Even if you are not familiar with his work you've probably received emails of things he's written and were unaware. My favorite has been when he rated the drawings of children and gave them a letter grade for their work. Hilarious.The book however wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. It does certainly have it's comedic moments especially when I read the term ""ovarian delight"" and the chapter about boobs was great. Maddox has actually done funnier stuff than this in the past but I guess all that funny somehow didn't make it to the book. I have to say I was slightly disappointed.When I read ""I hope they serve beer in hell"" it was a nonstop laugh fest. The Alphabet brought some strong chuckles but nothing too gut wrenching. But if you're a fan of the genre and the author by all means pick it up. I personally was just expecting more with Maddox's name on the cover."
5,Maddox delivers,"While I would have preferred that he updates his website once in a while, I am not too unhappy that he has been working on this book instead.Truly very funny. If you don't this this is funny, there is something wrong with you. Of course, Maddox is a one-trick pony. But he is very good at that.I hope he runs for president one day. And wins!"
1,Horrendous,"Not sure what I thought I was ordering but this is grotesque. Make sure you know what you're in for.If this rating system permitted, I would have given this zero stars."
1,Yuck!,"I bought this book for my father; a national review I had read made me think it would be funny and a little crude, a good guy book. I can't give it to him! Way too many ""F"" words, just nasty in places. I don't know...I think guys at a stag party would blush if they read it!"
3,Not as funny as the website,"The book is pretty childish and superficial, and doesn't have the entertaining wit and sarcasm that The Best Page In The Universe has."
2,Falls Short of expectation,"I thought this book would be hilarious, assuming that the guy that wrote post after post of side splitting rants on his website would be able to translate that wit into book form. i was wrong. most of it sounds forced and a lot of it is so sexist that even i, who revels in offensive humor, was bored. i hardly laughed once throughout. a shame because Maddox is usually a funny guy."
3,Entertaining,"To start off, this book is funny. It's not quite as good as the website consistently is, but it has a lot of funny things that most people have come to expect from Maddox.However, a few irritating things stood out to me as I read it. The first is that Maddox absolutely LOVES to try to make himself sound smart, which he does primarily by using semicolons ad nauseam. It wears pretty thin after 50 or so pages.Second, Maddox's raging insecurity permeates every sentence in the book. The premise, though funny, is designed entirely to make Maddox feel more manly. It's pretty annoying as well, especially because he habitually ridicules insecure self-promoters on his website but does it himself.While a lot of the ideas in his book aren't original or particularly insightful, they're very funny and it's a good light read as long as you don't mind Maddox's sometimes abrasive writing style."
5,Great Story!! Surpisingly Hilarious!! Do Not Miss It!,"I only watched this movie because I like Doctor Who which starred Peter Davision and I wanted to see him in a role other than the Doctor. I knew the plot so I actually expected to be bored. Because I expected to be bored the humour caught me by surprise. I laughed out loud often. What a delightful story! Good plot and story with no swearing or car chases or blood and guts. I can't say enough! If you are looking for a good story with laughs and a good cast, you have to buy this video."
2,Two Maxtor EHD drive failures in two years,"I had a Maxtor 60GB Personal Storage 3100 External hard drive I purchased about three years ago. It performed exquisitely-- very fast, very convenient. I talked my wife into getting an identical setup for her computer. In time, all my laptop backups and all of the home movies I created were on mine.When the wife's failed a year ago, I ignored this, thinking it just a fluke. She has bad luck with computers. I knew mine was treated with TLC and would last forever, so I continued to use it to back up my laptop and to store all my home movies. Then last week mine failed. Whenever it's connected to my computer it just goes ""tick... tick... tick... tick... tickticktickatickatick"" then starts again. All my stuff is gone.That's a 100% Maxtor failure rate. I'm going to purchase another brand."
1,What you see is NOT what you get.,I did not receive the album shown here. I received an album that would be more appropriate for a baby shower. I emailed the vendors customer service department and did not receive a reply. I would not recommend purchasing from this vendor.
1,You do not get what you order!,"Instead of the nice artistic floral covered photo album, as per the photo, you receive a cheap solid color covered album."
1,Album looks NOTHING like the picture!!!,"Just go to Wal-Mart & pick out the one you want. I wish I had, instead of wasting the money on that piece of crap. I also could could have saved on shipping."
2,not quite what I expected,"The Photo Album is a good price and it was the style I was looking for. But...I thought I was ordering navy blue like the picture shows and when it came, it was green. In small print I finally found somewhere that it says the color may vary, in other words, you have no idea what color they are sending you. If you do not care what color you get, it's a good deal and a quality product."
2,"Product OK, but company blows",I ordered two of these albums. As shown in the picture one was dark blue. The second was teal with flowers. What are the odds I'm going to want those two albums side by side on my shelf? Idiots! I contacted customer service (nicely) and NEVER received a response.
1,poor quality,I wish I read the other reviews before placing my order. The cover design looks like baby shower stuff and the book quality is poor. Pages are flimsy and there is no place to write captions.
2,photo is decieving,"I ordered this photo album thinking I was going to get something pretty with flowers or some other design. What I got is simply a plain, black fake vinyl binder with photo pages. I could have done better at WalMart."
4,Worked great,This was labeled solid color covers and it wasn't. Luckily I didn't care what the cover looked like I just wanted to use them for temporary storage. I feel they are a good value for my needs. But beware you won't know what the cover looks like until you open your box. You can always use your creative abilities to recover the album if you want something special. They were also shipped fast and I had them in my hands in just a couple days!
4,Christmas Presents,"I had a lot of extra pictures of my kids and wanted to do a photo album for them for christmas, there was plenty of room for the pictures I had and they still have room to add more."
4,Awesome Product,"Pioneer Classic 3 Ring Photo Album with Assorted Colored Covers, Holds 504 4"" x 6"" Photos, 3 Per Page.I loved this photo album. It was exactly what I was looking for as far as style and size. My only issue was that is was rather difficult getting the pictures in and out of the album but with a little extra patience, it was wonderful!"

1,A Shame,"It is really a shame that they sell this video to people who are looking for guidance in such a sensitive and important area of life. This video is a real discredit to the instructional genre. There are some truly great videos out there that teach everything you need to know about the G-Spot. The best ones I would recommend are ""New Sex Now"" or ""Goddess Worship"" if you are mature and adventurous, or ""New Free Sex"" if you are a prude. Don't let this weak Better Sex Video turn you off or ruin your experience with instructional videos."
1,Ridiculously Bad,"It's funny how it seems that most videos by Sinclair are just outright poor in pretty much every way according most reviews... This is no exception... Poor quality production value, very UNATTRACTIVE couples, crappy looking sex, simply all around unpleasant. If you actually do give MONEY for this, remember this review. Why you did'nt believe I really meant *EVERYTHING* is bewildering..."
2,Irwin Quick-Grip not as good as the original Quick-Grip,"I have several original Quick-Grip Mini bar clamps that I bought in late '90s, early 2000.On the original Quick-Grip Mini bar clamps, the two pads are very close to be parallel - the clamping force is therefore uniform; as it should be.Now, today's Quick-Grip bar clamp are made by Irwin and the quality is not the same. The two pads are not parallel anymore. The tips of the pads contact each other first - the clamping force is not uniform. I cannot use them on my woodworking projects.The original Quick-Grip Mini bar clamps made by American Tool Companies in the USA were of high quality.Today's Quick-Grip bar clamps are made by Irwin in China, they look similar to the original Quick-Grip, but the quality is just not there."
4,"Quick-Grip, good product","It was a fast delivery and the grip was as indicated, except for one thing. The 546 grip is supposed to give 150 lbs of pressure. On the carton it is indicated 100 lbs and under the picture, it is written Up to 150 lbs.I can't test for the real pressure it give, but they work well and I am satisfied.Andred"
5,"MORE,MORE","I wrote a lengthy review on another Robert Goulet CD so i'll keep it brief for this one. But i do have to say they did good putting these two albums together because they are 2 very good albums of his, songs like, I TALK TO THE TREES, THE NEARNESS OF YOU, ANOTHER TIME ANOTHER PLACE, POINCIANA, THE MOON WAS YELLOW, YOU STEPPED OUT OF A DREAM, from the album, SINCERELY YOURS. I have this album in mint cond. & still have the picture poster th@ was given to you w/ the album, inside. The other album on this CD, MY LOVE FORGIVE ME, and the title song of the same, was a very big hit for Robert, and absolutly one of my favorites, just writting about it makes me wanna sing it.My Love Forgive Me...I Didn't Mean To Have It End Like This, and so on and so on. Ok, sorry, Please Forgive Me.Goulet Fans, this ones a must. Happy listening.Michael B. VA"
2,"Low quality video and sound, but unique","The quality of video and sound of this DVD set is low like of its VHS original of 1986, but its unique scenes showing Picasso are not available else. Remastering would be beneficial. ""Picasso: Magic Sex Death"" is by far a better choice."
4,The Backbone of My Research,"On Seas of Glory by John Lehman is an excellent, scholarly work written by, whom better then?, a former Secretary of the Navy. I found this book to be most useful while writing my Masters' Degree thesis on the Economic and Military impact of American Privateers during the American Revolution and the War of 1812. On Seas of Glory quickly became my primary resource among the twenty-three that I had used.I highly recommend this book to any person that is interested in U.S. History; Naval History or just have the desire to read an excellent non-fiction title. It was clear that John Lehman not only approached this work as a labor of academic endeavor, but it must have also been a labor of love.If you enjoy this book and you are interested in other pirate related books, movies and games, visit me at my website: (...)"
3,Mistakes ruined this book for me.,"I really enjoyed reading about the early history of our Navy and the men who created the traditions of excellence. It really had me until a couple really glaring mistakes called into question the accuracy of everything in the book.On page 388, "" the Eighty-second was assigned to make a textbook parachute assault on the Salinas airfield."" The 82d Airborne WAS NOT assigned the Airborne assault, the 75th Rangers were. There is a huge difference between the two units.In the epilogue, the date of August 2, 1991 was given as the day Iraq invaded Kuwait. With the war beginning on January 17, 1992. Even my girlfriend, who knows nothing about the military, knew those dates were wrong.To me, this calls into question how accurate the rest of the book is. I'm disappointed."
1,I'm going sane in a crazy world.,"I really must have misses something in torturing myself with this film. I just don't get why more and more movies are being produced with characters that deliver dialogue that makes absolutely no sense. This movie is just chock full of mental patients that really should be locked up for their own protection and the protection of others. And it frightens me to think of the viewers who enjoyed it.Someone please get script writers into rehab, cause they surely need to get clean and sober."
4,Not Exactly Like Hughes,"Previous positive reviewers have praised Bandslam as reminding them of an old school John Hughes flick and I can see some definite similarities between Bandslam and Hughes in some of the shot compositions and lighting, but Bandslam definitely came out in 2009. Really harmless way to kill two hours and unlike the promotion done by Summit Entertainment really may flop badly with the High School Musical crowd. Yeah it has the typical teenage sexual innuendo moments, but there's also this very intriguing plotline about being something different both in the characters of Will and Charlotte, and the consequences of such behavior. There's also this really sweet endearing message about the power of music to unite people of diverse backgrounds and bring about something truly beautiful. Even though I'm outside the target audience of the movie at 23, I enjoyed it and glad I bought it."
4,"Bandsla,","Had seen this in the theatre with my ten year old daughter last fall and really liked it. It is not a ""perfect"" film but very entertaining with endearing characters. And it has some very valuable lessons too. Dialogue was quite good, and unique. I was disappointed it did have more success in the theaters. We purchased it to show at her eleventh birthday party (sleepover) and all the girls applauded at the end. They actually thought it was ""cool!"" Hope you enjoy it too."
5,Bandslam (DVD),"Corny Movie...but I loved it.I am a fan of Aly Michalka and I saw this movie just to see her in it. I thought it was really good in the end. It had a good meaning. The acting was alright, except Vanessa Anne Hudgens isn't very good, actually she was horrible. But if you want a good (live-action) kids movie then check out Bandslam! It's one of the only good ones out at the movie (w/o CGI), don't even bother checking Furry Vengeance!(Highly Recommended)"
5,Needs a Blu-ray Release,"Excellent Movie ... In my Humble Opinion...But Summit has to get over their ""Only for Twilight"" love affair and start treating their other releases with a little respect...This really needs a Blu-ray Release!"
1,Do not buy this fountain. It is a piece of garbage,"After less than one year of owning this product, the sides began to crumble. It is not made of slate. It is made of cheap cardboard. When I called Beckett's customer service department, the woman told me that it was made in China and that the company was not responsible for what was done there. This is a good example of US businesses wanting large profits and cutting corners to produce substandard products that they will not stand behind. Do not waste your money. Look for a fountain that is actually made of slate and do not purchase anything by Beckett, as they do not stand by their products."
3,Sprtizer is just ok,"I have used this to set my makeup in the morning. But, honestly can not tell a difference. It is just ok. Will probably not reorder. But still love Colorescience."
5,it's some good stuff thrown together on one.,"i started off thinking ,if i should buy it or not. my decision was a good one. there is some tight stuff on this album, and that is what is so good about it, it's all on one c.d. . you can't get something like this all on one c.d. very often, . i rated it a 5, there are good beats to go with some of the best rappers in the industry. the c.d.n is tight, so get it. starts off hype and ends with a bang. you can't beat that."
5,"Great for Musicians, Helpful for Practice","Why purchase another music sheet again? With Notation Musician, you can turn a MIDI file (there are hundreds of free MIDI online) into sheet music.This will print music sheets for you. (If you want to be able to edit music sheets, get theNotation Composer by Notation SoftwareAnd this software does other things for practicing that's just amazing (too many to mention) check out http://www.notation.com/ and click on tours and see what else it does.I'm trying out the 30 day free trial, a great way to see if it works for me."
4,Giants is a good game,"I rented this game and wasn't sure about it at first, but let me tell you this game is a great game. I played it almost non stop scince i rented it. I think this is a game that you might consider renting not buying because it is about medium in length so you can easily beat it in like 3 days without playing all day."
2,Not at all worth buying!,"I see a few reviews on here from people who have played the PC version. The sad truth is that the PS2 version doesn't live up to how great people say the PC version is. The graphics are extremely poor - they look like a PS1 game! - load times are painful, and the gameplay itself is disappointing at best, downright tedious at worst - there are far too many places in the game where you have to do things just exactly right, or you die and have to start over from the start of the level. It seems like it was written by a bunch of english 'lads' who were just having a fun time, goofing around, trying to see what it would be like writing a video game. DEFINITELY rent it first - because you won't buy it after that.If you want a GREAT game in the same genre as this (albeit on a different platform), pick up ""Starcraft""."
5,Perfect for my voluptuous figure,"As a woman of larger proportions I find it quite difficult to find gorgeous, comfortable panties that hug my physique. These panties are GORGEOUS. I have recommended them to all of my pals who are of similar statures."
3,Heidi's Review,"I didn't know what to expect when I purchased this book. I thought it was going to be a ""dictionary"". There was a lot more to this book. McPhee had examples of dreams from his radio show and website. This book made me realize that dreams can be easily interpreted yourself, that you don't need any other kind of dream dictionary book. Every other dream dictionary book I've read said if the dreams were warnings and acted as if dreams are premonitions. However, this book is different, it's more down to earth and fascinating. A great tool if you want to understand your deepest or not so deep dreams!"
3,It isn't comprehensive,The book gives a few examples of types of dreams and how they relate to what's going on in the dreamer's life. I learned more about dream interpetation from Betty Bethard's The Dream Book.
3,The best dream interpretation book I've found!,"I've got a hobby of dream interpretation, and McPhee's method is the best I've yet found. He doesn't claim the symbols in dreams are predictions of anything, just that they represent feelings and concepts going on in your mind. He supposedly has determined the meanings so that they apply universally to all people. Perhaps that is the reason his book has so terribly few symbols! I find he's always been pretty accurate but I do wish the book had more symbols interpreted. Thus the 3-star rating."
4,Dreamy...,"I have listened to this man on the radio (he had a show in Santa Barbara) and he is a genius when it comes to decoding the symbolism in dreams. He has transferred that same genius into this book, making it so much easier to understand why you're dreaming what you're dreaming. One of the best dream books I have ever owned."
3,"Sex, Trash& Rock 'N' Roll","""Backstage Passes"" is a fun read, but certainly not a quality one. I enjoyed the glimpse of Swinging London Angie provided, but I really found most of the stuff she wrote hard to believe. If you are looking for a good David Bowie bio, I'd reccomend you go elsewhere. Angie spends much of the book bragging about her crazy life and sexual exploits with rock stars, which gets old pretty quick."
3,Insightful but not a fair acknowledgment of David's Talent.,"It was very interesting to read all about how he got his start and who he met along the way. It got a little ""OLD"" to constantly read how Angela felt she was responsible for David's accomplishments. Please, during the ""Let's Dance"" era, when his tours and album sales were skyrocketing, Angela was nowhere in sight. How did he do it without her? Hmmm.... I wonder . . Talent maybe???"
1,"Trashy, biased","Of the many David Bowie biographies out there, this has got to be one of the worst [though there are others that are competing for the title--ie. Alias David Bowie by the Gillmans]. In it his ex-wife--a horror through most of his life--simply bitterly airs all his dirty laundry while inserting many lies inside the mix to produce a very trashy, vulgar product. This work slanders without having any redemptive value. If you read other biographies, you will not only get info into this dark period of his life, but also on his coming out of it and moving on. I cannot stress how low this book has fallen, and have to recommend that it stays on the shelf."
2,Take It or Leave It,"I read this book some years back when it was first published. Although it wasn't so dull that I put it down, it by far wasn't the most gripping of stories. Angela tends to talk more about herself and her experiences while married to Bowie than about the man himself. When she wrote this, she was not a happy woman."
1,self centered bitch,This book is absolutely worthless. Nothing special is learned about David Bowie and his amazing career during the 60's and 70's. This woman makes Yoko Ono look like mother Theresa. She seems to want to take all the credit for Bowie's success and insists throughout the book that he would not have gone as far as he would have had she not been involved in his life.This woman is self centered and egotistical and it shows in how she writes the book. Do not waste your time of money buying this crap!!!!!
5,I love Angela Bowie!,"I've enjoyed reading Angie's essays on her website. She's actually a very good, witty writer. She really knows how to dish too. This tasty memoir made me laugh out loud at times. I definitely believe she was a huge influence on David...her brashness definitely rubbed off on him, in a good way! I liked reading about the ups and downs during their wild, crazy marriage. Although David probably wishes the gag order lasted forever!"
4,Bisexual Chic in the Glam Era,"Angie and David Bowie broke the worldwide 'taboo' on bisexualtiy, bringing to the forefront the real meaning of 'free love', and Ms. Bowie and Patrick Carr send us off on a rollicking sexcapade across the decadent 70's. Velvet Goldmine only touched the surface of this exhaustive Glitter Goddess and her Thin White Duke. Backstage Passes propelled me from chapter to chapter in logical fashion (Thank God) and left me wondering about 'Backstage Passes II'. Worth finding a copy or getting the paperback reissue, circa 1999."
4,Steamy!!!!!,"This book is so much fun to read. Angela is definitely a little bitter about the lack of credit she received for helping to establish the Ziggy persona, but the factual information dealing with Bowie's rise to the top is accurate!"
4,The Other Half of David,"Angela Bowie may be a little bit bitter, as most ex-wives are. Still, I liked her book better than many others written about David Bowie. She is sometimes vulgar, but also very witty and funny. It was a trip just to read about England and America during their days as a young, married couple. Angie was there, so she ought to know. Some of us were too young to see this time period. The song "" Golden Years "" really does describe her. Angela and Tony Defries did help get David where he is today, since both pushed him when he needed to be. No, I don't think she was some evil bitch. Many times, in this book, she says she will always love him. Yes, I am still a Bowie fan after this book. Diamond Dogs is still my favorite Bowie lp. Until David writes his version, this will serve nicely. Again, 4 stars for her sence of humor.By no means is this book boring."
3,Where The Bowies Are,"If you never paid much attention to David Bowie - and I confess I did not - then this kiss and tell by his ex-wife may make trashy reading. She certainly takes you back to the late 60s-early 70s London music scene when creativity seemed to be bursting out all over. Theirs was a sort of marriage of convenience, in this version, with Angie a glorified go-fer, doing anything to promote Bowie's career. She makes him out a cold fish, which is certainly how he looks. Their 'open marriage' meant both were free to dally with whomever they wanted, and she says Bowie dallied with Mick Jagger at least once, gossip that made headlines years back. It seems plausible. This may be the ""Angie"" in the Stones song, she contends. Bowie's music always left me cold, though a few of his bigger hits have held up. This book is a trippy look back at a time now long gone, though you'll wish you could have at least observed it in full flower."
5,interesting book review from a 28 year old.,"hi, all , my name is jon-michael. as a huge bowie fan, i must say i for one liked this book, it really is about, two people that loved each other deeply and then of course what happened along the way. fame is really tough and takes its toll, but i liked this book, it shows two strong people, and what they went through.the main focus of the book, is thier life, i mean those were the times then, you know, in the end, you learn about how, learning to really love each other more, through out what happens to you, even if it doesnt work out. well wriiten book."
2,...Poorly made...,"This is simply NOT a precision tool. It seems that their design and manufacturing is not conducive to consistent accuracy. My unit is also off 2 degrees in the vertical. The blade is allowed to wander between the vertical posts by design. As noted before, there are NO adjustments of any kind outside of the ability to lock down any angle via an allen screw. The clamp is awkward to use, moving it from one side to the other involves unscrewing and re-mounting a rod. Holding the blade above the work requires using tiny wingnuts that are, again, awkward to reach...Buy the Nobex Proman or Champion - get a real tool!"
1,"For rough miters ok, but PRECISION should NOT be in the name","Same problem as others, miters are off enough to make precision cuts a frustrating process unless you are very nearsighted or have lots of wood putty to fill miter gaps. Operating a manual miter takes some finesse. But no matter how you handle this saw, grip it, adjust it, bend it, or stroke it, the saw refuses to cut a true vertical 90, making this a unintended compound saw and the folks at Jorgensen don't even charge extra for this ability, lol. Stanley is worse, and Nobex still reigns supreme. Thank God *someone* can make a decent miter saw! There was a time Jorgensen saws were pretty accurate, but that time has past."
1,good saw / wrong materials,"When I first got this saw, I liked it a whole lot. It cut very well. It could use a couple more clamps though. Then the handle broke, sort of just snapped in half. The handle appeared to to made of aluminum or maybe magnesium. I searched for days, then finnally found a number to call. They sent me a new handle which broke about a week later. I am very dissappointed and I will now buy another brand"
2,accuracy,"I agree with previous reviews. No accuracy and saw cannot be adjusted. I cannot find a web page for mfg. or a method of ordering a blade with a finer cut. The number for the blade is #68081, but where does one order the thing?"
2,poor mitering,"the saw started-out working fairly well, but the cuts are no longer perfect. it seems there's too much play between the blade and the guides, because the cuts are NOT as perfect as they should be. or, it could be that the blade is too flimsy.if you're cutting VERY thin wood, you'll be fine. BUT, if there's any thickness to it, or if it's a hardwood, the cuts will not turn out perfectly.i'm looking to contact jorgensen about this, but i can't find a website, phone number, or anything . . . any help with contact information would be GREATLY appreciated!"
2,Not a precision tool,"This saw is simply not, as its name implies: ""Precision"". I was unable to cut accurate 45 degree miters. The 14 TPI blade was dull, or at least slow, when new and quickly deteriorated. I have been unable to find any store that sells replacements. Both Home Depot and Lowes have discontinued the blades. Lacking precision and replacement blades the tool is useless."
2,No Good for Accuracy,This saw has no precision. You will get tapered cuts. I am having to bend the posts in order to get a decent 90 degree cut. UGH!! Not worth the effort!!!
2,blade replacement,"I recently purchased the Jorgensen precision miter box and it worked very well for cutting moldings. When cutting heavier material, however, the cuts were several degrees out of square. I am guessing the blade which came with the miter box has gotten dull and needs to be replaced. Unfortunately I cannot find the 14TPI blade. A 24TPI blade which cuts metal is available and a longer blade for the professional model is available. Unless replacement blades can be easily located, I am sending the box back and expect to receive full credit.I will continue to look for a company address and the name of the CEO.If you know the address please list it for me."
2,Poor quality control,Received disk in record time. Everything went well until last song. Half way through This Land Is Your Land disk sounded garbled and stopped. I tried two different players with the same result. I would not recomend buying this disk.
2,Golden Classics Edition:,They need an age tune up so they can sing again poor stuff as far as quality!!
5,Great Classic Album,The Christy Minstrels were one of the finest of the folk groups from the 1960's. This album contains much of their very best work. I Highly recommend it to anyone who likes folk music.
5,Golden Classics Indeed,What can you say about the New Christy Minstrels. Their music is a slice of America. The songs tell stories of our nations past using both humor and pathos. Would I recommend this? An emphatic yes!!
3,I Liked Just a Few,"There apparently are only a few songs by the New Christy Minstrels that I like and this album has them. Since I used my credit card points to purchase it, I can say those 2 or 3 songs are worth the money for the whole album."
5,Fabulous recipes,"What I like most about this book is that I can prepare sophisticated meals with it without committing my entire day to the menu. I have the French Laundry cookbook, for example, yet I don't use it because of the enormous time commitment required by most recipes. Although none of the recipes in Samuelsson's book are meals-in-thirty-minutes, I can actually prepare them in a reasonable amount of time but have the kind of entree that I would often order in a restaurant. The outcome so far has always been wonderful and impressive.I agree with other reviewers that the recipes in this book are more Asian fusion than Scandinavian, especially with such ingredients as rice wine vinegar, miso, and cardamom pods. Still, the recipes are fantastic, especially the seafood recipes. This book is a must for anyone who enjoys modern California and Asian style cuisine."
2,aquavit,I was a very disapointed in the book. It was a large book with very fine print. The recipes were hard to read plus they were too fancy for the average person
1,Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"I loved this move as a kid so I was excited to show my own kids. When we started the movie it was all wavy on the screen and had a blue tint. The sound was messed up as well. I wonder if it was a boot-leg copy?? It was delivered to my house all wrapped in newspaper for protection so maybe it was damaged in transit? There was no return address or instructions for sending it back, so I couldn't even return the movie. I paid over $40 for this movie - I guess buyer beware!!"
1,Defective skates that they won't exchange,"Sadly, these skates don't roll and the company has refused to exchange them. Too bad because my daughter loves the look and feel of the boot, but she also would like to skate. Save yourself the trouble, buy something else."
5,These Skates are Great!,I purchased these to teach my daughter to roller skate-I loved the comfort and they are cute too :0)
1,Late delivery and no notification,We're disapointed with the speed of processing and communication provided on this order. Shipment will arrive 12/31 when the product was ordered 12/8.
3,Cute but slow,"Skates are super cute with pink and periwinkle wheels. My daughter is 7 and skating lots- asked rink to loosen wheels so they go faster, said they can't go any looser...and that is why they are inexpensive. Good for beginner skaters but would not recommend for kids who will skate frequently. After a month I already feel she has outgrown the ""speed"" of them."
3,"good skate, but with quality issue","Got this skate for my 6 year old, she loves it. It rolls well and she almost skated everyday. We used it for about a month, and one of the wheel does not roll anymore. Not sure, if it's the quality issue, or she just used them too much......? Anyway, she absolutely loves the color."
5,Great skates,"I bought these skates for my daughter's 1st birthday and they are great. She is still learning to skate so they are perfect. The wheels don't roll too fast for her so she can keep her balance. If you are buying for an experienced skater I wouldn't suggest them because the wheels don't roll freely for speed, but indeed perfect for kids. I bought 1 size too big and she has some room to grow but there is good ankle support so the loose fit doesn't bother her. Oh and by the way, they are absolutely cute especially paired with some good tube socks. Your child will be the envy of the roller rink."
1,Poor Quality,Purchased for my granddaughter in June 2011. Frame cracked after about 10 uses. I would expect a product like this to last until she out grows them.
5,WORKS WELL!,"THIS ALL IN ONE WORKS WELL. THE LIGHT IS BRIGHT THE CLOCK AND ALARM WORK WELL AND THE RADIO GET VERY GOOD RURAL RECEPTION. NICE COMPACT SIZE,LARGE NUMBERS EASY TO READ. RECCOMENDED."
5,Cool toy!,Cool Green goblin toy.It is very cool when you take the mask off.Also the costume is also cool!This is a must get one for every kid!!!
4,Mo B.Dick is a smooth cat,"Mo B.Dick CD Gangsta Harmony was a nice cd this is for all the people that game so if you don't thats probaly way you don't like this cd check out songs #1,3,7,8,11,13,14,17,18 these are smooth songs and some dance songs"
4,mo b(eats) tight cd,"mo b came wit some tight beats on this one. this isnt really a rap cd. its r&b mo b just sings and has rappers featured in some of the songs. i know no limit has been comin hella weak lately wit silkk, big ed, c-murders new one etc., but mo b dick brings back some decent no limit music. the good no limit music came out before ghetto d. this is easily one of the top 10 no limit cds"
1,I THINK THIS CD IS GOING TO SUCK,"THIS CD WILL BITE JUST LIKE THE REST OF THE NO LIMIT CDS RELEASED LATELY. THIS ALBUM WILL SELL LIKE SONS OF FUNK NEXT TO NOTHING. SEPT 1 WAS THE LAST TIGHT LIMIT CD DROPPED AND THAT WAS BIG ED, EVERYTHING AFTER THAT HAS SUCKED. BEATS BY THE POUND BETTER GET ON THE BALL OR P WILL LOOSE FANS SLOWLY. HE IS ALREADY LOOSING ME. HERES SOME ADVICE P SLOW DOWN."
2,I.....a true No Limit fan waited long for this!!!!!!!,"I am a true no limit fan. I have close to all of the Original Member CD's. On cover after cover, I saw ""coming soon"" for Mo B.Dick, I waited impatiently, becuz this had to be the best No limit R&B CD ever. All the numerous soundtrack appearances made Mo B. the tightest ever to me. But when I bought this CD I could not feel anything here, like I could on the soundtracks. This was a dissapointment to me. I've waited all this time for this, (to be honest I tried to take it back to the store to get my money back). I ain't no hater and I still love Mo B. and No Limit but this was a dissapointment. Two stars for him being Mo B. the one that put out all the tight R&B songs on the No Limit soundtracks."
3,If you Andre 3000 sangin'......,"Unfortunately the tank was running out of gas when this album came out. It was actually good but at the time it didn't get any publicity. This is one of many slept on No Limit albums that came out between late fall of 98'- present.Guess what big name artist stole an entire song off of this album and made it into a hit.1,2,3, HIT IT...."
4,Pretty sick,"This is a sick CD. If you liked LSG - black album, then youl'll like this. This is like deep melodic trance with a little touch of house. Those who have every oliver lieb album out there must buy this. As we know oliver lieb has like a million aliases (i.e. paragliders, SOL, LSG etc) so he probably makes or comingles with other artists in probably 8 of the tracks. It's nice to see that he's still producing tracks."
2,Interesting material but disappointing,"To me this book promised more than it delivered. For a start itwas written in a journalistic style, for example sentences thatwere regarded as important were shown like headings in bold typee.g. ""in a journalistic style""I for one found this annoying particularly as the author is aprofessor and should have written a more scholarly book.The book deals with all of Hitler's life. It tells how he rose to power and once he became Fuhrer dealt more and more severelywith any real or imagined opposition. The most famous oppositionof course culminated in the July 20 1944 bomb plot. His coverageof this is quite good and he shows that even though Hitler wasnot killed the conspirators might have seized power if they hadnot hesitated and waited for others to act.There is a good selection of black and white photographs."
5,brother bass,"MAXIMUM BOOM VOL. 3 IS THE BEST BASS ALBUM NEXT TO THE PREVIOUS MAXIMUM BOOM ALBUMS. I'M A TRUE BASSHEAD. MY FAVORITE SONGS ON THE ALBUM IS VOCODER BASS, NU JACK, BELOW ZERO, NUMBERS, RICOCHET, QUAD INFINITUM, TRIPPIN ON THA BASS, AND SMOOTH N' LO. I LOVE BASS BECAUSE I CAN SING. I HAVE A VERY DEEP VOICE AND I SING BASS/BARITONE AND SOMETIMES WHEN I LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM, I COPY THE BASS TONES THAT'S BEING PUT OUT. YO, THIS MIAMI BASS GAME IS REAL AND I RECOMMEND ANYONE WHO LOVES THE MIAMI BASS, AS WELL AS THE DIRTY SOUTH BASS, TO BUY THIS ALBUM. I'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE RELEASE OF MAXIMUM BOOM VOL. 6. I LOVE THE SOUTH. MAN, THIS BASS GAME IS REAL!!!!"
5,Good CD,Excellent CD. I use it to relax my clients and all have commented how much they enjoy the ambient music as well. Very soothing!
5,My soul is touched with Beauty,"To listen to Touching Beauty is to listen to a calming Sea.The songs go from one wave to another capturing the inner beauty of my soul.Stop,listen and feel! My two most favorite songs are Unspoken Words by Hiko and K'un by Frank Steiner.Hiko's song allows me to hear my own soul. Thank -you for putting together a CD that gives one the chance to do just that."
1,misleading and very disappointing,"Don't waste your time or money on this. I'm not very demanding when it comes to film, but for the most part, this is material that had me figuratively slapping my forehead wondering how anyone ever decided to film this, much less distribute it on DVD or other media. Except for the black and white spoof on gay reorientation techniques, and a slight nod to the anatomically incorrect dolls in the first vignette, I have rarely seen [anything so bad]."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I was somewhat disappointed with this book. I felt it could have been a bit more in-depth and maybe more focused by removing the section on windows forms and concentrating purely on ASP.Net (and renaming it ASP.Net). One feature that really annoys me and is commonplace in ASP.Net books is how the author states the obvious that codebehind is a great feature and should be utilised, and nesting code in aspx pages avoided if at all possible. Then all the examples are shown as aspx pages containing nested code blocks. Arrgghh!On the good side Jeff Prosise has a good clear writing style, his description of 'background info' is good, and the book is really well presented in choice of fonts, layout etc. Also it's good that the examples are in C# only."
4,Good asp.net and an okay .Net book,This book concentrates more on asp.net and more over the first part is just a poor rehash of Jeffrey Richter's .Net Framework book. Two chapters - one on multithreading and another on remoting - can be considered advanced for the asp.net programmers. Expected lot of depth from the MFC Prosise but the book just left me looking for other better books..!
3,"Fair to Good, but panders to MS","This book is informative and easy to follow. Jeff Prosise is a proven writer for windows technologies.However, my biggest complaint is his constant pandering to Microsoft. I have lost track of how many times he writes how Microsoft revolutionized such and such industry, with such and such product. I am left with the distinct feeling that any short of shortcomings in the .net framework will be glossed over. It is unfortunate that I run into this so often when using Microsoft press publications."
1,Inane,"I never cared for the 1973 stinker, ""Playground in my Mind"" and thought the lyrics quite inane.""My name is Michael, I've got a nickel, I've got a nickel shiny and new. I'm going to buy me all kinds of candy, that's what I'm gonna do."" With a nickel? That didn't go far even in 1973, the year following the Watergate Scandal and the year of the Energy Crisis.""My name is Cindy, when we get married we're gonna have a baby or two. We're gonna let them visit their grandma, that's what we're gonna do.""How inane is that?While Mr. Holmes has a nice voice, the sheer inanity of this song proved costly."
3,Candy Coated,"Picasso: The Man and His Work (Parts 1 and 2) is a candy coated version of a the life and work of a volatile genius. Little depth is given to the relationships with the women in his life - just the vague notion that used them as models. Some of the film was repetitive or went on too long, some important aspects of the work are not even mentioned. I had a hard time deciding who would be an appropriate audience; adults who have had any art history will be disappointed in the glossing of reality, high school students will bored by the repetition and younger kids will lose interest."
3,I EXPECTED SOMETHING BETTER.,"This documentary really didn't grab me like I hoped it would. The interviews with surviving cast members from both shows were shallow. And most of the narrative wasn't anything you haven't heard before. But according to this documentary the reasons both shows were cancelled, are you ready for this? Here comes the SPOILER. Read at your own risk. Because the networks wanted their respective shows to start filming in color and the studios couldn't afford to do so. Other VHSs You may want to consider are The Addams Family and Friends, The Munsters: The Lost Episodes which is a documentary, or Addams vs Munster Family fued which combines the first two mentioned on one tape."
5,Holly's Angels,Author Holly Harrison has put together a wonderful and diverse collection of angels crafted by artists from across the country. The dozens of beautifully photographed angels come with clear instructions and patterns. My favorites are the simple Kitchen Spice cinnamon-stick angel and the elegant stained-glass Blue Angel. A great book for craft enthusiasts of any skill level.
2,angels,Receive my copy this morning and am pleased with it not the usual boring angels one sees. So it was amazing that someone let go of their copy so cheap.Good for inspirartion.Check out the Elvis angel hardly run of the mill angel if you're into him
5,"Through his songs, I have felt every tear of his life.","Mac is a wonderful entertainer as well as writer. He brings you into his life with each word. I felt as if I was there during relationships, breakups and the joy of his children. He has no idea how much joy he has given to us as we listen and laugh and cry with him."
3,Just ok,"I liked his hits like ""Baby don't get hooked on me"",Hard to be humble and ""whoever finds this - I love you...which has wonderful lyrics.But the rest of the tracks are average I would say."
4,More Mac For Mark,"I love all of Mac Davis' tunes & albums. But the one album that I really need to get is ""I Never Made Love {Til I Made It With You}"". Every song on that album is great, exspecially ""A Special Place In Heaven"", for that is my wife's & my wedding song & I really would like to play it alot more often for her than I can. Maybe if some of you viewers out there can help me get them to put this album on CD I'd really appreciate it [I'm sure my wife would too]. So if you can, please help! Thank You!!!!!!!"
4,Very Interesting,"It is quite obvious that Mr. Gregory has done his homework here. There were several interesting details which I had not read before. He is very anti Al Fayed. But he did strain his credibility with me when he twice mentioned that JFK was assasinated in Houston. Mr. Gregory must be very young! I enjoyed the book. He argued his ""case"" very convincingly."
3,Interesting book but he sure hates alFayed,"I'm still in the process of reading this book but two things are already apparent to me. 1. Mr. Gregory seems to have a powerful dislike for Mohamed al Fayed. 2.Since the wildest conspiracy theories don't hold up he seems to think that means none of the rumors could be true. I agree that the Princess likely did die in an accident but to absolutely rule out foul play is going too far. Many of Mr. Gregory's debunkings seem very well thought out and informative, even probable, I just have a feeling that something is missing."
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"Martyn Gregory's account of the couple's final journey is riddled with inaccuracies, distortions and falsehoods."
2,"shipping was great, but product does not work well","shipping was quick and successful, product packaged well. However after dying my hair with product (it seemed to work beautifully) i am unsatisfied, since the product washed out of my hair within two washes!!! I loved how it went on smoothly and perfect during the application, and after it was applied. I really do wish the effect did stick around! I am only sad that it washed out, and my money and hopes went literally, down the drain. Thanks for letting me try it out!"
4,pretty good,"For me it seems to take more steps at first, but I hope to get a hang of it soon. Nice smell--just wish the color stayed a little longer. Will anyhow buy again."
4,soft and shiny,"I was a little worried about using this product. However, I couldn't use more chemicals because my hair was already in bad shape from bleaching and perming. They are right, it doesn't go over highlights well, but I think it looks good anyway. I love the color, it is so natural looking on me that my kids didn't even notice. My hair is soft and shiny and looks in better shape.I rinsed it well for a long time and the color was still running. I hope this product stays in my hair a long time. I will use it again, and perhaps use the neutral powder for my daughter's dry hair."
5,Great Results,"This henna works really well, gives great saturated color, and is for the most part chemical free. I hope Amazon gets it back in stock soon."
4,"The first Review is inaccurate. I say: Excellent Coverage, Pretty Color just wish...","...it lasted longer. I have been using for about six months. But have to refresh every week. Aside from that, it does leave my hair soft and full of body. The color has a slight reddish tinge in the sun.As of 5/12, I do not see the dangerous ingredient she mentions on the package. The list of ingredients may have some non organic dyes, but no where is there listed the dangerous ingredient she mentions, and I have looked."
4,Natural look,"I tried this product for the first time about two months ago. It is a lot less messy than the Henna powder and I felt that it lasted almost two months. The only thing I don't like about this product, is that it made my hair dry and hard to comb through. I recommend using an intensive moisturizing treatment after you color your hair."
4,Surya Henna Mahogany Cream,"Bought this for my girlfriend, since she likes her hair random colors at timesthis does the trick when going back to her ""normal"" hair color without the funky chemical smell"
2,Surya Henna Disappointment,"I purchsaed two bottles of this Surya Henna, followed their directions and none of my gray hair was colored. This may work for other women but not me!"
1,doesn't cover stubborn grey,"even if left on 4 hours, did not cover roots and washed out very quickly and then rootsturned red/purple and had 2 different colors going on. have allergies to hair dye but this is not the solution. just doesn't do the job as well as i would like it to."
5,A Great Product,"My hair is off white, naturally. I didn't want to use amonia products so decided to use this product and it worked like a charm. It does fade but just touch up and you're good to go."
4,Beautiful,"The color is very bright and pretty. After a couple of washes it fades, then almost disappears, but still leaves a nice tint on gray hair."
1,"If you like pink/purple hair, then go for it.","I used this product once and it will be the last. The good thing about this product is that it doesn't have an odor and it did color my grey. However, the covered over grey came out pretty reddish at first (along with my scalp), but then the hair started to take on a shade of pink and then purple. For the hair that wasn't originally grey, the color was too dark and very flat / no sheen. I have colored my hair with true henna powder several times and got much better results. I will not buy this product again."
5,Love this stuff!!!,"I saw a review of this product on youtube when I was desperate to find a hair color that would cover up my awful grey hair. I have dry, relaxed color treated hair, and for some reason I have lots of greys on my hair line and on my temples. At first I tried the chocolate which was ok but it left me with grey hair that was now chocolate, it looked ok and did the job. Then I tried the dark brown and tada! it covered everything nicely. I dont use heat on the color so I dont know if it could have come out more brown, but I'm happy with the results."
2,What it DOESN'T DO!,Although your hair will FEEL great--it will still be gray as gray can be. Doesn't turn gray hair silvery at all.
1,Don't Believe The Hype!!,"This product is very promising! Even comes with a plastic shower cap, plastic gloves and instructions; unlike, the powdered henna. However, the results are very diappointing! Unlike some people, when I purchase a new product I'm not familiar with, I use it according to the instructions only; just as I did with this product. According to the instructions, 30 minutes gives light brown hair and 45 minutes gives reddish brown. I left the product in for 45 minutes and my hair hadn't changed AT ALL. I certainy will not purchase this again. Dont believe the HYPE people!"
1,THEY SUCK,OVER 16 DAYS AND I STILL HAVENT RECIEVED THE PRODUCT... THEY DONT ANSWER UR EMAILS AWFUL COMPANY TO DEAL WITH...
1,UGHHHH!!!,"ok let me start by saying it felt nice in my hair and washing out my hair, if your looking for something to condition more than color than this is for you. if uh like seeing the product on your towels each time your hair gets wet after rinsing it out properly than feel free and buy but if yuor like me and enjoy stain free towels and you want color in your hair then dont waste your time monmey &energy"
3,its okay product,"First, if you have longer hair get two. One is not enough. I have naturally black hair but I am starting to get a few lighter strands after child birth. I wanted to intensify my hair also because it gets a red tint after being in the sun. This made my hair soft and it does cover the silver only if you leave it in for a long time. i believe it says thirty minutes but leave it on an hour. I don't trust the potency either of the henna. It begins washing out immediately. When I use real henna infused with indigo and mix it myself it lasts a lot longer than this."
5,great product,"The color lasts and lasts. It covers grey very well. It doesn't sting or smell bad. It does stain your ears, and scalp, just like the harsher peroxide based dyes. The stain does come off very easily with regular shampoo. I'm glad I found this."
1,This is NOT henna!!,"This is certainly NOT henna! Henna can only stain hair in one color: red-orange. Real henna comes from the Lawsonia Inermis plant and it only comes in powder form. Its ingredients are Lawsonia Inermis leaf powder and NOTHING else!!! This is purely compound henna, which is not henna at all and it does contain metallic salts which are carcinogens. I definitely do not recommend this product as it is not henna, but just an advertisement. If you want to buy henna, make sure that it is in powder form and that the ingredients list Lawsonia Inermis. Anything other than Lawsonia Inermis leaf powder if NOT henna!!!!"
3,Natural color--semi-permanent?,"The color came out really natural! My natural hair color is light-medium brown, and the color came out a darker medium brown with a warm reddish tint. I love the color. It lasted only 2 and a half weeks for some reason. The item description really didn't specify how long it's supposed to last... But! the coloring looks natural, it's easy to use, natural and no animal testing! I bought two boxes initially. If you are looking for something permanent, I'd stay away."
4,Henna,Conditions hair at the same time as colors. The grey hair colors into auburn highlights. Only lasts 2 to 3 weeks
4,"Not magic, but great.",My hair is around a level 7 dark ash blonde. Getting ashier every year.The coverage of my color that isn't white (ie: loosing color) was great.The coverage of my hair that is already white/wiry is not so great.I would definitely purchase again. Much more convenient that other henna products I have used in the past (the powdered kind you mix with water)
4,I like it...,"I like it... I use it every 3 weeks... the color is beautiful and rich in the beggining and washes out gradually. It's better than using regular dies, though its not 100% natural either."
1,Check out the ingredients,"I am a breast cancer survivor and am looking for a safe hair color to cover my gray hair. Unfortunately this is not the one. It contains a few natural ingredients and synthetic ones. I checked this brand out on the Eviromental Working Groups Skin Deep cosmetic date base. You type in the name of the product and it is rated for safety and all the ingredients are listed and broken down into what health hazards they can cause. This product did not do very well. As a cancer survivor I will not be using, or reccomending this product. I encourage everyone to get on line and check out the Skin Deep cosmetic data base before purchasing or using any product!"
1,Things are not what they seem,"I tried this ""henna"" b/c I get dizzy with any type of hair coloring. The chemicals and me just don't agree. This chocolate cream made me have the same reaction so of course I had to rinse it quickly and for a long time. As you know this take forever. Now that my hair is dry... the grey is yellow. Thanks for nothing Surya ""Henna"" Cream."
4,Great,"I'm not sure why some of you would only leave it in for a few minutes, but I do know if you leave it on at least an hour it lasts 2 - 3 months. I love the Surya line...I've tried the dark and light brown and pleased with both."
1,wasted money,. I think that I wasted my money because this Henna Silver Fox just didn't do anything to my hair. I am very light blonde.
5,Surya Henna Dark Brown Cream,"This stuff is great!! It covers my roots beautifully as well as the rest of my hair and the color still looks great after several shampoos. Will never buy a commercial hair dye again, only Surya for now on."
5,Always Ideal Alternative to chemicals,"I love Henna. It is an ideal replacement for chemicals in the hair and covers grey fairly well, if you don't have that much, or just want softer, shiny hair. My hair is very dark and I use the Dark Brown. It covers the grey that I have underneath my hair, and it works for a couple of weeks (3-4) and my shoulder length hair gets two uses out of one bottle."
3,OKAY,It does not harm the hair in anyway. It is very safe for overprocessed hair. The downside is that is does not last long.
3,"Great softening properties, no color hold.","My first experiment with henna was withGodrej Nupur Mehendi Powder 9 Herbs Blend, in which I liked the result but not particularly the mess associated with mixing and applying henna. I tried this on a whim because it combined color. I applied it exactly as directed and for the 60 minute time as noted in the insert. When I went to rinse it out the mahogany color went down the drain as well and stained my scalp mahogany. Obviously I am disappointed with the color hold, but the ease of applying the product and the softening effect it left on my 4b natural hair was amazing. For me the color rinsed off my scalp with two shampoos ofKeracare Hydrating Detangling Shampooand a 20 minute conditioning treatment withKeracare Humecto Creme Conditioner. I also remember my hairdresser telling me that some people's hair will not hold color well, I just may be one of those people."
3,It's okay,Nice color but pretty basic and looks like your typical hair coloring product. I would check out other henna products as I don't think this is totally natural
1,This stuff sucks!,Bought 3 bottles and followed directions exactly as stated. It does not cover gray hairs at all! Big waste of money and an even bigger waste of time. I sat around for 3 hours on the last treatment with a plastic cap on my head for nothing. My hair was clean and dry and even rinsed it off with cold water and used no shampoo. What a useless product!
4,"Deep color, soft and shiny hair","Great product. The result was a deep brown color with lots of shine. Have gotten several compliments on my hair since using it (this is my second box). This is a temporary color; it stains the towel and fades over time. But dry hair does not stain the pillowcase. Easy to apply, not toxic-smelling which was why I made the switch from Perfect 10. I'm not going back to regular hair color."
4,Product fresh through Amazon,"I have bought Surya Henna Cream at health food stores, and they have often not covered my white hairs very well at all. I suspect they had been sitting on the shelf too long, because the boxes I've gotten through Amazon have done a really good job. I used ""Dark Brown"" last time, and might go back to it because the color of my white hairs turned out less red than the Light Brown. I might try Golden Brown again, too. With this variable of freshness it is hard to compare the tints. I don't have a new box at home at the moment, and I don't remember if there are ""use by"" type dates on them, but if not, I think there should be."
3,Didn't cover my grey hair!,"Could be a good product for me, if it covered my grey (my original hair color is medium brown, I have around 15% grey hair).I tried all blond shades, and they didn't work on me for grey hair coverage.The maker advice to use Golden Blond for grey hair coverage. Didn't work either. Works well as a conditioner."
4,Love the coverage hate the drip,"I love the way this covers the gray, but I have run-off color for the first 7 - 10 washes. It's easy to use and the color is wonderful."
1,Does NOT cover gray hair!,"The product is easy to use but it does not cover gray hair. I have a lot of gray at my temples. I tried this product 3 separate times. I left it on over an hour and re applied warm towels over it and still the gray hair came out red. The color was not a pretty red either, it was a Bozo the clown red color. Absolutely horrible!!!I'm so disappointed. I was really looking for a natural, easy to use product to cover my grays. This is NOT it!"
4,Love it!,"I love the color and it was a very easy process. Clean up was very easy, no stains on my skin or my sink. My only complaint is that I feel the color chart is a bit misleading. My natural color is darker than that of the henna results color pictured on the chart, so I doubted this would have much effect on my hair. It gave me a beautiful rich brown color. Surya also left my hair feeling soft and healthy. It was just a lot darker than I would have guessed based on the info in and on the package. I will definitely order this product again, I just thought that warning was worth posting."
2,more fiction than fact,"The title and reviews give the impression that this book is a collection of the black arts and secrets of analog design. It isn't. 80% of the chapters are old-timers' ""when I were a lad"" stories. It's not necessarily a bad book - it's highly entertaining and well-written, and new graduates will find the real-life hints and caveats useful, but if you have more than a few years of experience in the industry, don't expect to be educated."
3,Good Writing,"I have just recently started listening to Dave Moore.I find this cd quite interesting for a number of reasons.In Sharks dont sleep it sounds like a nice riff from a dire straits tune in the electric guitar work.In much of the singing I could have sworn I was listening to John Stewart of Kingston Trio and latterly California Bloodlines fame.The writing is really quite intimate (Big Drafty House,Painting this Room) but not maudlin or so personal it should have stayed home.I am really enjoying this cd and suggest it to anyone who is in search of good songwriters."
5,Who's Dave Moore ??,"I have to admit until a few weeks ago I had never heard of Dave Moore but I was browsing through 'Amazons' massive store of CD's and came across the album 'Breaking Down to 3' ""wow"" I was moved - I've been collecting music for more years than I wish to remember and I don't know how I've missed DM - but I knew I had to have a copy of this CD - I now have a copy and boy I can't stop playing it - it really is a wonderful collection of songs, beautifully performed and accompanied by superb music played by excellent musicians (I don't know them but they sound great)- if you like cool folksy music I would say - go get it"
1,Not Worth Buying....,"I initially purchased the Sinclair Better Sex Videos that are advertised on TV, in magazines, and online. They are practically everywhere. I figured that why not.When they arrived, I we were turned off by everything that was shown. The couples are not attractive, the information provided was not helpful, and they were vague when it came to the positions and what to do.if I can give this video a 0 I would. Don't be fooled. Stay away.If you are looking for a great sex position video, try: Sex Essentials Videos: Seductive Sex Positions."
5,I HAD WILD SEX WITH THIS DVD!,"(...)With this video, it showed some extreme locations and position to have sex, and just one of them was the shower. She personally likes the missionary position, but there is about fifteen other positions in this video that will also help. Honestly, buy this video! The night you recieve it, I guarantee you that your sex life will immediatly kick into action, as soon as you pop this baby out of your DVD player. Guy's, your lady will be shown how to make your little john feel more pleased than he has ever been, and ladies, my wife says that your vagina will never feel the pleasure her's has after this video. So if you want the best sex you've ever had, EVER, then buy this DVD right now!!!!"
2,Get a book instead,"Better Sex Video: Sexual Positions For Lovers - Beyond the Missionary Position DVD...Well, the video does talk about the above subject but it a boring way.They use a very dated panel of people sitting in a talk show dialog and have rather boring subjects to interview. It would actually be better to just read a book on the subject..."
1,"BORING, CONTRIVED - WASTE OF MONEY","This pretentious program is old, boring, and teaches absolutely nothing new. Ugly couples, contrived scenes, irritating ""experts."" I would give it zero stars, but the lowest rank is one star."
5,5 estrellas CD,"DEFINITIVAMENTE ES UNO DE LOS MEJORES CD'S DE EROS RAMAZZOTTI DESPUES DE SU REGRESO EN EL 2000. ES UN NUEVA EVOLUCION DE SONIDOS Y MESCLAS DEL NUEVO SIGLO VVI.FUOCO NEL FUOCO,IL MIO AMORE PER TE, IMPROVVISA LUCE AD EST, Y AMICA DONNA MIA, SON MIS CANCIONES FAVORITAS. RECOMENDADAS."
4,Stilelibero,"The music on this cd makes me feel good while I am working at home in my kitchen or when I drive my car - alone or with my family. I can think about the famous country ""Italy"", the sun, the sea and the people, who spend more time outside than we do in Germany and for me this is a feeling of freedom. The man's voice is excellent and I saw him two years ago in Munich at ""K√∂nigsplatz"". Since then I like his music, because it makes me feel good."
4,A guilty pleasure I fully cop to!,"I'm not a pop music fan, and when a French friend insisted I listen to this, I thought ""Great...Italian pop recommended by a Frenchman!"" I was absolutely floored. The duet with Cher had me dumbstruck, their voices just flat-out beautiful. It's very, very romantic, as one might expect, and I'm completely sold on this young man. Buy it, buy it, buy it!"
5,Good Paint,"I don't have this ""can"", but I do use this paint. It makes very vivid colors on paper and is easy to clean up. My kids always ask for ""goopy"" paint over water colors or finger paint. Sometimes we just paint a plate and wash it. Saves paper."
2,Cheesy,"If you're considering this book, pick it up and read a section of it (some are under a paragraph long). If you think its stupid, you'll think the whole book is stupid. If you like one section, you'll like the book. Its cheesy. It tells nothing about where these urban legends started. Its a loose collection of urban legends. It made me smile a few times but it never made me laugh. Its good to have to sit next to your toilet for reading to pass time. My kid didn't like it really. She came to me a few times because she didn't understand what was so funny about a story. And I couldn't find it. Kind of a waste of time. I give it a two because i think if you can't get your kid to read anything else, this might be the kind of reading he or she would want to do. I picked it up for us thinking it would be funny and it wasn't really funny at all."
4,I'm not the only one who knows about these guys!,"I got this completely by chance. I didn't even buy it. The album was bought for me by my gran who doesn't exactly share my taste in music because she thought I'd like the cover and she thought I was into robots (I'm 20 so I'm kind of over that stuff). They are really cool, I made all my friends listen to them. Their music is unique and whats more you can actually call them indie. I think the internet would've really been good for these guys pity, maybe the'll read their reviews and revive the band. Take a chance its only 1 cent attach it to another order, you won't be dissapointed."
1,don't waste money,My daughter received this camera for her 4th birthday. She loves taking pictures. We found the film to be difficult to load and as another reviewer pointed out...the rewind handle broke and I had to take camera to a store to get pictures rewound and developed. Spend a little more money and get a camera with automatic film loading and rewinding.
1,Does Not Rewind,"As mentioned in the previous reviews, this camera works until it is time to rewind the film. Very disappointing to my four year old daughter as she had taken special pictures of different family members at a once-in-a-life-time type family reunion."
1,Total waste of money!,I bought this camera for my 5 year old last year for her birthday and it was a complete waste. She was so excited to have a camera and it didn't even work. I had to return it and ended up wasting a roll of film. I'm waiting for the Fisher-Price tough digital camera to come out.
2,Cheap,"My daughter very much enjoyed this camera while it lasted! It has a manual rewind for the film, which is the worst part. It ended up breaking on the second roll of film...we just trashed it and bought a kids digital camera, which was a much better investment. Do not waste your money on this product."
1,Disney Princess 35mm Flash Camera kit,"We bought this camera for my 5 year olds Birthday. We had trouble from on get go. The camera is difficult to rewind and the film continues to get stuck in the camera. We have wasted 3 rolls of film and counltless memories. We would not buy nor recommend this camera to anyone. It has been a total disappointment!Sincerely,An unhappy customer"
1,This is a really bad book,"Making your way through this book is a difficult process that requires a great deal of patience and probably a dictionary. Unfortunately, the awards are few, made apparent when you realize the points that the author tries hard to obfuscate are superficial. Not only is the writing style nearly impossible to get through, the book lacks any deep analysis of culture or economics. The visual tools that the author uses to illustrate his theories are made up of huge oversimplifications of international economies."
1,One of the worst books I' ve ever read,"This book is really one of the worst books on economics I've ever read. First, the conceptual approach of comparing economic systems is a joke - how useful is a dyadic system if ALL cases to be explored end up in one of the categories? Second, the book lacks any reference to the ongoing discussion about ""new comparative economics"" or neoinstitutionalism - both tools that could be very helpful to compare economic systems. The author either does not know these discourses or chose to ignore them. Third, the ""analytical"" results presented in this book are nothing more than the usual general prejudices about economic systems. The ""overviews"" over certain countries are a collection of platitudes which are really breathtaking in their oversimplification. Fourth, the style of writing is bad. Fifth, I have no idea why this mediocre book is so expensive."
4,another great toddler teaching tool,"The best thing about this book is that it fits a toddler's attention span perfectly. Words are used sparingly and the phrases rhyme, making it more fun for a little one to ""help"" you read it. We have all four books in this series, and our two year old son loves them. Great for teaching shapes and colors since the illustrations are so vibrant, and the pictures are familiar to kids who watch the tele show."
2,Read this in high school,"I read this when I was a teenager. It was very inspiring to me back then. Since then I have learned that men and women, as human beings, are not so simplistic as the book assumes. Whether a man loves a woman or not is not necessarily only because the woman is doing the techniques/things that the book teaches. (At the very least, I wouldn't want to marry a man that is that simplistic and ""manipulatable"".) The theory can be seen as part of the whole picture, though, and it certainly is an interesting theory at that. The book is an especially interesting read if you are in the ""boy crazy"" stages of your life."
2,Her methods sound hookie!,"She does have an interesting theory that every man is either a ""seeing"" ""Feeling"" or ""hearing"" man and depending on which they are is how you communicate with them. Since I have not applied her methods I am not going to say it doesn't work, but ""Make up, Don't Break up"" makes much more sense in understanding men & being able to get closer to them."
4,A-Z Dating Do's and Dont's,"After breaking up from my relationship i was told about a book called ""the rules."" I searched long and hard for this book, and once finding it, everything i read; i related to. This left me wanting to know more about this subject. I found ""How to Make a Man Fall in Love with You : The Fail-Proof, Fool-Proof Method"" a very learned read! I found interesting the debth of which the author has recorded seeminly every single little mistake that most women make once in a relationship.I refer to ""the rules"" as my bible and ""How to Make a Man Fall in Love with You : The Fail-Proof, Fool-Proof Method"" as my A to Z dating do's and dont's. I really beleive that these two books complement one another and should be recommended reading for any pre-teen, teen, young adult or mature aged woman both single and or committed women.This book is a fantastic read in which I highly recommend!"
3,There is always something to learn,An interesting read with pointers for those who enjoy learnning how to improve communications between beloveds or future beloveds. I read it in an evening and managed to watch for some key points when dealing with members of the opposite sex.
3,Interesting but hard to implement information,"This is a decent read for broadening your psychological knowledge. It has some good points and ""emergency"" tactics. But some of the tactics that are recommended to be implemented regularly are quite hard to do for several reasons. First, you always have to be self-cautious of what you are doing, like watching your own every move, which doesn't let you relax and enjoy and is quite unnatural. Also, trying to implement some tactics made the guy feel uncomfortable, he sensed it wasn't the ""real"" behavior even though i had somebody else watch it from the side and they didn't notice it being obvious or me not doing it well. And also, it makes you concentrate on you and your own behavior and tactics and not on the person in front of you. I would much rather watch them and analyze their behavior than having to be fully conscious of my own. Good read, has some great points, I would recommend to read it once, but wouldn't use it as a reference book."
2,Great service,"This is a fun read. I knew a lot of what they suggest just by having common sense. The book doesn't say anything profound and I recommend ""The Rules"" instead because I still revert back to that book every now and then. This book doesn't really give you any good tips to think about."
1,I can't believe this book has been re-issued!,"My friends and I had a secondhand copy of this in college (there must have been an earlier edition, because the amazon listing shows it as having been originally published in 87 but we were definitely reading it in the dorm in 85) to howls of amusement --which is NOT to say we didn't try some of Tracy's tactics. I vividly remember an evening at the ice cream shop near campus, my eyes riveted to the man of my dreams across the table, mirroring his every gesture and move -- my friends around the table cracking up because they had all read the book and all knew exactly what I was up to.For the record, it did not work. It does not work. Any so-called ""scientific"" or ""fool-proof"" method to ""make"" someone fall in love with you DOES NOT WORK. Get over it. Save your money."
4,Read this in the 80's and Boy did it help!,"Because of the title I was embarassed to even buy the book but it provided a great lesson in what I had been doing wrong in relationships. I applied the lessons in the book and have been very happily married for 14 years. Like any self-help book, you have to sift through what is good for you but it really gives you some great pointers on how we communicate in life not just with a potential spouse but with everyone. Another good book I read back then was ""Love Signals"", I don't know if you can still get it but it was great too."
3,Applied Neuro-Linguistic Programming,"This book gives an overview of the different styles of communication used by various people and how communucation can be made easier and more effective once those differences are identified. The claims made in the book are a bit overstated, but the premises are accurate."
2,Meh,"This book isn't worthless, but it's not very good either. Cabot encourages women to be positive, specific and proactive in their approach to men, which I appreciate. She devotes a good portion of the book to the ""love languages""--auditory, visual, and feeling. This information, so long as it's not pushed to the extreme or used by a manipulator, is interesting and could help people in any sort of relationship. However, ultimately, this is still a ""man-hunting"" book, with all that that phrase implies. I think that Cabot's approach requires a bit of tunnel vision, a bit of obsession about men, and a lot of manipulation. Take what you can from it, but I think that Sherry Argov's Why Men Love [...]is a better investment."
1,Heard it all before!,"I would say, don't bother with this book. First of all it's jam packed, the print is tiny and its just an endless stream of sentences so you get bored and loose track and its just a pain! Then the information in the book is pretty useless It has a lot to do with old fashioned seduction techniques which men see through a mile away and has absolutely nothing to do with the magic ingredient that actually makes people fall in love with each other. I think to be honest if someone ever found out what that magic ingredient was they'd bottle it and be world famous by now! The truth is, you can seduce anyone into liking you or fancying you, but 'love', 'real love' I don't think so! Obsession and dependence perhaps... but do you really want that?"
2,Too complicated!,"In my opinion, the advice given in this book is too complicated.You have to find out to what category a man belongs (it explains how to find out) and then, according to this category, try to make him fall in love with you. I found it very difficult to put into practice."
1,what a piece of junk,Using this to help assist me with building braces 4 encaustic supports. The center bracket assembly would get in the way makin this item totally useless
4,A good book to learn and practise Tai Massage by yourself,"As a Chinese doctor, I know 2 most popular massage in Asia: Chinese and Tai Massage. It's not easy to learn all meridian points (several hundreds in all) for good results in Chinese therapeutical massage. Just following the book, you may learn and practise Thai Massage. It seems easier for most people."
2,This chair is impossible to assemble,"This chair is impossible to assemble. The holes for the screws are too narrow such that we have been unable to fully screw in half of all the crews despite getting blisters on both hands. In the attempt, the ""screwdrivers"" provided by the manufacturer have blunted before we managed to assemble everything (normal screwdrivers cannot be used). We have therefore not been able to assemble the table that comes with the chair. Finally, the assembly instruction are a series of blurry pictures that are difficult to decipher."
4,Durable and Safe for PDA,My husband loves this for his Palm Treo. The case is a little large but he used to drop it or it would fall off of his pants and this case closes and is durable. He wore the first case out after 4 years so I was glad I could find this one.
4,Good for some uses,"My children had given me a Bucket Boss holder for a vell phone several years ago. I bought this for my Blackberry, which I usually keep on vibrate. It does hold up like Bucket Boss stuff does, but it dampens the effect of the vibration. So, I've had to turn the ringer on. But, I can put the Blackberry holster inside this one, which does work out well."
1,Get what you pay for,"I was looking for a cheap portable radio to listen to music and ball games while I worked around the house. This seemed to fit the bill.While I realize that this was only a couple of dollars, I do expect it to work. Unfortunately, one of the clips holding the neck rope broke while setting it down on a table. Really! I cannot get one AM station to come in no matter what I try, where I stand, or how I postion it. There are several powerful AM stations in the city I live and in nearby cities. FM stations do come in but slight movements and repositions can cause some fade in and out. Overall, I wish I spent a few more bucks on something better. This will likely be in the trash can in a couple of days as it would cost more to return it than its worth."
1,Junk,"I purchased this about 3 months ago and the arm rest/back rest is already broken. This unit gets used about twice a week by a person who weighs far less than the rated capacity of 300 lbs. The snap together construction is easily broken as it is made of a brittle plastic. Big, big disappointment."
5,Excellent Product,"It is sturdy, yet light weight and can easily be moved up and down stairs if necessary. A cinch to put together (didn't even take 5 minutes). Great portable commode for the price!"
4,New space rock- or at least new-to-you...,"For fans of early/classic period Tangerine Dream, Ash-Ra Temple, Klaus Schultze, Hawkwind, Amon Dull II, and the like. This double-album serves as a best-of into disc to US fans likely to be unaware of Radio Massacre International. The 1st disc is culled from their non-domestic releases, while the 2nd disc was recorded live in the USA in May, 2004.Highly recommended to all space fans."
1,I COULD NOT REVIEW THIS BOOK I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT,NO SE SI ES QUE YO NO ENCONTRE LA MANERA O ES QUE USTEDES EN REALIDAD NO DEJAN QUE UNO REVISE EL LIBRO ANTES DE COMPRARLO NO PUEDO OPINAR NADA ACERCA DEL LIBRO.aTTe:MIGUEL A HERRERA
3,Open Sesame Understanding American English & Culture through,"This book contains exerpts from famous folktales and stories in American Culture for ESL students. The exerpts are short and manageable for most intermediate to upper-intermediate students. At the end of each story, there are comprehension questions and vocabulary exercises to support the story- This book is a great supplementary tool for the classroom, or for students who are trying to understand the basis (and Background) of many American Metaphors and analogies. I was a bit disappointed by the book, because I was looking for a course book, and not a suplementary book."
4,AWESOME!,"Eric Benet first came to my attention about 18months ago,quite by accident,It is no accident however that this album proves his immense talent and shows we have many more years to look forward to his work and be graced by his talent. His live show is beyond words,go see him and fall under his spell."
2,"Eric, What happened?","Eric, honey, I'm afraid my money would've been better spent elsewhere. And what's up with that ""lovin' your girlfriend"" mess? Where's the sensitivity, the respect, the love I felt with your first effort? I was one of the first to notice and feel the appeal of Eric Benet when he appeared on the scene with True to Myself. But Eric, I'm really disappointed with this new CD. I enjoy three songs on your CD: the first, second and last. Brother, you've got the voice, the sound, the style, now let's mix it up and come correct with some originality, some purity and some of your heart, the same way you did the first time, and mama will give you one more chance. (I had to give you two, because if I gave you just one, then I would look like the fool for paying 13.99)"
1,Moderately good,"Eric definately had an agenda with this album. In other words, he clearly wanted to go commercial, but to me he shot himself in the foot. His music is lacking originality. I always mix-up ""Georgy Porgy"" with ""Sooperman Lover"" by Chico Debarge, and it's true that Eric does sound similar to Rahassan Patterson. Eric, bring it back to yourself!"
5,Joining the stampede,"Hate to say that I am also going to join the stampede....great album. I was waiting for this album since I had heard a sneak preview a few months ago. It has stayed in my CD player since I got it, and copies have made their way to girlfriend, friends and whoever else likes good music"
5,A MUST HAVE FOR REAL MUSIC LOVERS!!!!!!,"Once again Eric has managed to reel me in with his smooth, strong and sexy vocals and soul-stirring lyrics. This is a masterpiece that will take the listener on an intoxicating journey filled with funky twists and turns, silky riffs and rhythms, and melodies that will stay in your mind. Every track is a winner from #1 to #13 with social, spiritual and sensual themes throughout. It's perfect for bouncin' in your ride or chillin' in the comfort of your favorite place. Now, if I can only catch the LIVE show! But for now an ice-cold glass of water will have to do because Day In the Life is truly a scorcher! Peace and respect. CLB. PS. Eric---you still ""true to yourself?"" *smile*"
5,"Off the Hook, a must have cd","I have an advance copy of this cd, and I am excited for this project.Mr. Benet is going to take us into the 21st Century will an awsome cd!"
2,'hope the next will be better.,"this is the second efforts of eric benet.but i prefer eric's debut""true to my self"".after i listened to the whole music on this album,i think he has lost his directions in making music.he is no longer ""true to thim self'in making music.i think he had too much of""so called neo-soul"" syndrome in his mind.maybe he was confused whether to make this album to be HYPE or HONEST.therefore i think his debut is much better compared to this one,it's just too bad that""true to my self""wasn't promoted properly.but i still find the first two songs of ""a day in the life"" made my day.that's just my way and his version of gorgy porgy is dope.but after that first two songs,i just always had to skip my cd changer to sumthin'else."
3,Not a huge fan,"I am not a huge fan of Eric Bennet. I didn't really like the songs played on the radio. When I got the cd I liked Just My Way, Lamentation, Ghetto Girl and Love The Hurt Away reminds me of D'Angelo. When a friend took me to see him live I realized Eric Bennet can perform Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. His stage presence is phenomenal. His sex appeal is through the roof. If sistahs aren't feeling his cd, check him out live. He gives a great performance."
1,Eric lost himself,Eric should have remained a little more true to himself on this album...in my opinion his first album was better...I only like his two hit songs on this album...and they include featured artists. To me Eric is starting to slack by trying to go commercial...and yet he still has not gained superstar status...Maybe Halle will help him.
2,Disappointed,I was very diappointed in this CD.....I only like 2 tracks....and those are the 2 that are played on the radio
5,Spendin' My Time w/You,"This album is well done and worth purchasing. If you are not an Eric Benet fan, this album may make you change your mind. The album is laid back, funky, romantic and mellow. Most of the songs are memorable and you find yourself singing along or humming the melody. His collaborations with Faith Evans and Michele Ndegeochello are fabulous. Even more so was his duet with Tamia ""Spending My Life"". It is such a beautiful song sung with heartfelt emotion and is great for all romantics. If you like mellow R & B and can appreciate hearing a nice voice behind slick grooves and melody, this is just the album for you!"
4,A Day in the Life - actually 4.5 stars,"I bought Eric's album after hearing his beautiful duet with Tamia then hearing the ""slamming"" remake of ""Georgy Porgy"" with Faith Evans. IMO, this album should have set his career on fire and did to a certain extent but sadly, the embers are dying due to this looooong gap between this project and his new one.Eric's voice is amazing, the songs on this album are perfectly suited to his style and voice. There really isn't a bad song on it just a few that really stand out:Georgy Porgy - such an excellent remake, it almost makes you forget the original with the inimitable Cheryl LynnSpend My Life With You - dreamy ballad, the blend of Eric & Tamia's voices is genius. Beautiful song.When You Think of Me - jazzy ""why did you cheat on me?"" grooveWhy You Follow Me, Come As You Are & Love of My Own - beautiful mid-tempo ballads.Overall, I would highly recommend this album to those who like smooth, soulful r&b grooves. You won't be disappointed!"
4,This one was much better in my opinion,"My first experience with Benet was off his first CD, back when he was opening up for Eryca Badu. He came off as a wanna be rock star who's stage act was too loud. On this CD he came clean with serious versus and excellent production. I don't listen to many male singers (I only fanaticize women singing to me) but this one caught my attention along with Maxwell, Olu,Omar & D'Angelo. This CD has had it's share of play in my CD player and is a great buy for my vast collection of music.oNe"
4,Slow Grooves,"I cannot believe that I searched for ""That's Just My Way"" for weeks and didn't know it was Eric Benet. This is certainly a smooooth CD. I especially grooved on ""When You Think of Me"". It really makes you think of people you have known who didn't think you'd make it. Whether male or female, the words of this song speak the truth."
5,GREAT CD,"The first CD was great, but this one tops the first! Go and get it NOW! One of my favorites."
2,Disappointed,I hate to compare artist to their last project. I was expecting alittle more of Eric Benet's originality. What I found is Eric trying to keep - up with the rest of today's artist with the same sound. I think Eric should have been more true to himself and kept it real.
1,Sorry I don't like it......,"Sorry, but I don't think Eric Benet's Cd is all that. He needs other people to sing his songs. He doesn't do it for me."
2,Will success spoil Eric Benet? True to yourself?,"On a lotta the romantic male singers, I have what I call the 'Wife Test'--if she likes something, pay attention to it, if she really, really likes something, I better run out and get it and give it to her ASAP, no questions asked. I thought Eric's new album was ok, when I heard tracks on it...I mean, what can I say? If you have read one of my other reviews you know I'm pretty much an ol' skooler--it takes something very exceptional to move me sometimes. My wife, however, really did not care for Eric's new one...""Not like the one 'True to Myself'. Now that one was really nice and sexy in a smokey, lazy kinda way. This sounds too much like all that other stuff on radio."" Then she said ""I thought he said he was gonna be true to himself"". I dunno, but all I can say is that I thought the original ""Georgie Porgie"" was already a great tune....what do you want me to tell my wife, Eric?"
1,E......What happened?,I totally and completely wasted my money. I probably will sell it to CD warehouse. Better than collecting dust. I'll buy the single with him and Tamia and him and Terry but that is it!
1,IS ERIC BENET ANOTHER PUFF DADDY,"I'M A MUSICIAN FROM MEMPHIS TN, WHO IS TIRED OF PRODUCERS USING MUSIC THAT WAS ALL READY RECORDED BUT DID NOT MAKE IT TO THE MAINSTREAM AND THE SAD PART IS MOST OF THE LISTENERS ARE TO YOUNG TO KNOW."
1,Save your money,"I was quite disappointed when I played the cd. I was hoping for the original soundtracks, but its not the same. Most of the songs sound like they were played on a Casio keyboard set on harpsichord. If Mike Post was actually involved in the making of this album, I would be surprised. Mike has created the BEST themesongs on tv to date, so I was excited to see this album released. The deep bass notes are nonexistant in any track, and the theme from Hardcastle & McCormack is missing the vocals. The cd says the tracks are ""Original Sound Recordings"" by Michael Jones Productions, but they sure don't sound original. Not worth the cd it's recorded on."
1,Not the original recordings!,"I've got to agree with the above reviewer - this is a pretty poor CD - not the original recordings! My wife and I have 9 month old triplets, and they love the theme from Law and Order - they stop what they're doing and watch the screen whenever the theme song is on - and we hoped to get the CD to use in the car on long trips, but they don't pay any attention to this copy. There's none of the driving bass so prevalent in Mike Post's music."
4,"""yesterday and today's popular TV themes""","Silva Screen presents some of yesterdays and today's most popular television themes from composer Mike Post. This CD contains the arrangements and performances of Mark Ayers and Daniel Caine, not the original music heard from the soundtracks. Ayers and Caine have captured the mood and style of Post, which is a great listen and very entertaining.Some stand outs - LAW AND ORDER starring Jerry Orbach & Sam Waterton - MAGNUM P.I. with Tom Selleck - ROCKFORD FILES with James Garner - THE A-TEAM with Mr. T and friends. All of which still pack that music punch which opened each show every week, so we could lose ourselves in the world of adventure and make believe.Total Time: 43:52 on 15 Tracks/ Silva Screen Records - STD 5022 (2000)"
1,"Once was Enough, Thank you!","I think this book should have been permitted to die with the author. It never should have been published because it's a mess.The characters are so cardboard and one-dimensional: Dolores is a cold, sexless flirt who cares about nothing but money and maintaining her jet set lifestyle. Her sister Nita comes off like a promiscuous tramp. Their mother died calling the name of an ex-husband who did nothing but cheat on and humiliate her.Dolores' friends are empty-headed and shallow (I mean, having a litter of puppies put down because they are cross-bred, as opposed to purebred? I wanted to strangle that particular character). The men with whom she becomes involved are empty suits.Her in-laws come off as bloodless parodies of the Kennedy family with none of the family's humanity....all faults, no virtues.I read the book once....and once was more than enough for me, if I may paraphrase the title of another book by the same author."
2,Not a good read,It was a very poorly written book. I do not recommend it. There is no substance to it at all.
3,Jackie on Jackie,"Having just finished a biography of Jacqueline Susann (Lovely Me), I wanted to try a Susann novel. I had never read a one before, and was curious to see if my impression of her writing was correct. This one may not be typical. Like all her novels, this one was heavily edited and may have been added to. Since this one was published after her death, she did not get a final say. I chose it merely because it was short.The book is a thinly veiled take on why and how Jackie Kennedy became Jackie Onasis. It appears that Susann transfered the values of the characters she created for her novels (mostly based on friends and acquaintances in the entertainment world) and put them in these new characters, mostly based on the Bouvier/Kennedy/Onasis families. Women in this novel seek love, but never get it. The men in this novel may be re-creations of her philandering father. Money is a motivator for everyone."
5,Carex round Shower Stool,"The product is a very good value: reasonably priced, good quality. It's small size fits well into a small shower space, and it's light weight makes it easy to move."
3,"Nice size, adjustable, can be used anywhere.","This little stool is light-weight and just the right size to use in a small shower stall. It was easy to assemble and adjust. I am mainly using it as a stool for my dressing area. Set at it highest level, it acts as a perfect seat for putting on make-up, curling hair, etc. When I need to use it as a shower stool, it is easily moved and lowered to the lowest point. It does seem a little wobbley when used in the shower, but as a dressing stool on the carpet, it works fine. I think it probably can rust if left wet for any length of time, but for a low-price seat, it can serve a two-fold purpose of shower and dressing stool."
2,Being cautious wasn't enough,"I had read reivews so I coated the bolts and washers with clear acrylic to prevent their rusting. I also enlarged the very small openings in the rubber caps for the legs, to allow water to pass through more easily. However, after a few weeks rust started showing up where the legs were draining. The legs are made of aluminum and wouldn't rust, so I guess it must the springs inside them allowing the legs to be adjusted causing the rust. I'm not sure, but rust was there. I finally threw it away yesterday."
3,Almost comfortable,"The Carex Round Shower Stool is a good fit for a normal size bathtub or shower stall.I like this product however Carex could make this into a great product instead of a just OK product by making two changes.1. The Carex Round Shower Stool is a little bit flimsy. By adding crossbars to the legs of the stool would give this product a much more secure feeling as well as being able to support more weight.2. The seat is molded plastic which is fine but there are no holes in the seat for water to drain from. So when you sit on it when wet and then stand up, the standing water on the stool acts as a seal between the plastic seat and your butt and the stool (because it is so light weight) tends to stick momentarily until the weight of the seat breaks the seal and falls back down. The recommendation here is for Carex to add some water drainage holes.With those changes this would be a great product. The product as currently designed is adequate."
3,Right Size / Shape - Construction Worrisome,"I haven't had this particular stool as long as some who've encountered the rust issue, but I have already noticed the push stops are made of a material that is causing them to corrode a bit and it's already becoming less easy to re-adjust the leg lengths. But adjusting the leg lengths was a bit awkward to begin with as the legs can rotate freely out of alignment from the push stops. For the price, I wasn't expecting anything too impressive, and for the price they weren't probably expecting to get impressive feedback either. So I'll go with the 3-star ""it's okay"" rating because it's thus far the dimensions and features I wanted... and the price I was happy with."
2,Carex stool,"I am using shower stool since 1 month, i have noticed that rust is forming around screw of seat.Why rust should form when it is supposed to used under shower?"
5,stool,WE HAVE A VERY OLD TUBE BUT I CANT SIT IN THE TUB SO I NEEDED A STOOL AND I HAVE LOOK AND LOOK AND OTHER STOOL I HAVE GOTTEN I HAVE TAKEN BACK BUT THIS STOOL FITS JUST WRIGHT THANK YOU AMAZON I CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON YOU TO FINE WHAT I NEED
4,Quality stool but pricey,"This is a well-built product. I used this when I was recovering from ankle surgery and could not put any weight on my foot. The adjustable seat height is nice, and it stays where you put it. The only thing that would've been nice is if there were small holes in the seat for drainage, under the shower head water did pool on the seat when I wasn't sitting. Also, the price could be lower. This is essentially just like any other little stool except it has rubber feet, but since it's a ""medical device"" it costs twice as much. But it also has the adjustable seat height which is hard to find in a regular stool. Overall I am satisfied with it."
4,"Aaaah, knees below hips","make it easier to stand up. I have a tiny shower, the higher I sit the less space I take up."
5,Great Stool,We received the stool and my auntie is very pleased with it - it really helps with her bathing (along with the bars we installed). Thank you.
4,Very Good Stool,"Carex Round Shower StoolI ordered this stool in September 2007 to take on vacation. The stool is a perfect size to fit in small tubs and showers. It is easy to assemble. I have no trouble adjusting height of stool.Once the seat came off when I picked up stool by the seat. I tightened the screw by using a wrench and pliers. No problems since then.I paid $28.50 + $6.88 shipping. I could have free shipping but did not have time to wait the extra days. Current price is only $21.99.Amazon's $6.88 shipping price was reasonable. I paid $13 to ship home the stool because I did not want to carry it on the airplane.I highly recommend this stool, especially at the current low price. I meant to give it a five-star rating but accidentally clicked on four stars."
1,"Nice small unit, but came without all the pieces!","Frustrating -- when we tried to assemble it there were supposed to be 5 nut and bolt assemblies and there were 5 bolts, but only 1 nut in the package. It is still in the box waiting for someone to find the right sized nuts."
3,Fits in small shower,"We have a little stand up shower, and MS has made it very difficult for me to stand up for a shower for long. The seat helps, but it tends to wobble, which throws my balance off. It would be perfect if it didn't wobble."
4,It's a decent product,"I have a prosthetic leg and use this stool to relieve the stress on my good leg from standing the whole time. The stool is fairly sturdy and certainly does the job, but keep in mind I only weigh 160. It's very easy to assemble and adjust the seat to different heights to suit your needs. I rated this product a 4 because it probably could be made with better material, but for the price, it's a good product, no complaints."
1,Filth in the Fast Lane,"Sorry, I couldn't make it past page 100. Full of vulgar back and forth conversation, supplemented by some ""insider"" tour lingo? which does anything but make one laugh.This is not representative of the good golf fiction that's out there. Sure there is a market for this stuff. Some of us opt out. Jenkins sure will be off my author to read list.If this represents reality of big-time tour golf, shame on the whole lot. Society is beginning to tire of heroes that are anything but."
2,Disappointing,"Fans of the Dan Jenkins of old will be disappointed in ""Money-Whipped Steer Job....."" and its sequel, ""Slim and None"". The old Dan Jenkins poked politically incorrect fun at everybody and everything. The new Dan Jenkins has sacred cows. Unless you, too, think very highly of Fort Worth, TX, you'll find little to connect you to these books."
2,Double bogey,"I started the book with great expectations and it continued to disappoint. I never got the point - mildly humurous but not really very interesting at all. After reading ""A Good Walk Spoiled"" and ""My Usual Game"" I was probably looking for more than Jenkins could deliver with this wandering tale of a year on the tour. His history of the golf architects and courses was the most interesting part of the book. I couldn't wait for the season to end."
2,Not Jenkins' Best,"I eagerly waited on the release of this book, but it turned out to be not very good. Jenkins had me laughing once or twice, but not near as much as in You Gotta Play Hurt and Dead Solid Perfect. The narrator was 40, yet always made references to movies that a person would have to be 60 to remember. It was like Jenkins was too lazy to properly date his lead character and instead used references that someone in Jenkins' generation would connect with. I agree with the reader who said Missing Links is much better. Someone looking for a good golf novel will also enjoy Troon McCallister's books."
2,You can't always go home again....,"As some have noted, Dead Solid Perfect was a dead solid hit among golfers and has been the standard by which other golf novels are judged. Unfortunately, the author who created the standard has failed to measure up to it. The story is mildly entertaining, but just not up to what we have come to expect from this writer. Having recently read The Green and A Mulligan for Bobby Jobe, I am aware of how good a novel can be woven about this enchanitng and maddening game. This isn't one of them."
4,"Worth reading if you like Dan Jenkins, but not his best work","I like Dan Jenkins' humor a lot. He seems like a guy you'd love to spend time with and I have enjoyed reading all of his work I've read. And, I enjoyed this book. But, I can't say I found it to be close to his best work (I really liked Baja Oklahoma, among others). It just didn't quite seem like Dan's heart was fully into writing this one. It took me quite a while to finish reading it, even though it's a short book stretched across 261 pages. The characters weren't all that interesting and there wasn't really much of a story, so all I had to savor was the humor and use of language. That's enough for me to read it, but it needs more to be a 5 star book."
1,"A Reheated, Quick Copied, Amateurish Rush Job","So Dan Jenkins transcribes a bunch of not very funny observations about the PGA Tour and all his half-literate acolytes can't stop spitting their beer through their nose. What a con job this one is. Dead Solid Perfect slightly re-written to cash in on the ""rising tide"" of golf popularity. Don't be fooled. Try Reilly's ""Missing Links"" for the real deal."
3,Good CD-Rs for a Good Price,"For one thing, these CD-Rs are better than Imation. They're just as thin, but Imation cracks if they are stacked up in a pile.These CD-R's are 99% error-free. Some errors might occur if you are over-burning more than the capacity or if your software has an error.The only problem is that the silver might peel off and it's not a good idea to put CD covers because CD-Rom drives would have a hard time reading them. With a CD cover:1. After 40 minutes, my DVD-drive fails to read the CD.2. My CD-RW drive won't read the CD after 50 minutes.3. In a laptop drive, the CD makes flapping noises.4. In a CD player, the players does not read it after 5 minutes.If you want more durable CDs, buy at local stores. At least that way, it would be easier to return them."
1,The content did not live up to the title.,"Despite an intrigueing title, the book read like a doctoral dissertation. It was full of important schoolarly references, but hard to follow and dry. I would have prefered the more informal style the title implied."
5,What an uplifting book,If you are searching for peace and a love-filled heart this book is a good starting point. I like James Allen as an author and always find his writing
3,One merry album.,"I actually saw this band in Columbia Missouri, circa 1992. I can't remember anything about the show, but I remember liking their music. The first song from this disc ""Black Halo"", is easily one of the best tracks here, and the reason I bought this used just recently. Ah memories. Anyway, as much as that song nearly rocks, the next track is very simple. However I like it almost as much. Other stand-outs to me are ""Solucinations"", ""Which Dreamed It?"", and ""Rejected"". Maybe it's just the vocal, but this group reminds me some of Throwing Muses. Overall, a nice listen and I think their only album. Well worth the used price here."
5,Quick and Easy,"Although more expensive than bar clamps or pipe clamps, the Quick Grip clamp makes up for it in its ease to use, non-marking rubber contacts, and easy adjustibility. I make specialty wood products and typically finish my products before the final assembly stage. Since I do not make fixtures for these, as the low volume does not justify it, these clamps allow me to use one hand to hold the wood and the other to work the clamp. Not possible with most conventional clamps.Also, I've made the mistake of buying the lookalike clamps. They work okay; however, they do not deliver the same clamping pressure. I only use them as supports to the Quick Grip clamps.These clamps are strong enough to clamp glue joints without leaving gaps. I use the ones I have before I resort to my other clamps.I cannot say enough good thing about them. I recommend these to all wood workers."
4,I finally found it!,"I've heard Our Winter Love over the years but have never been able to find out the name of the song or artist. Lo and behold this morning, our radio station FINALLY gave the name of the song; my previous calls to the station were nonproductive!! Now I can order the CD. I agree with the other reviews that it is a most beautiful and haunting arrangement. I could, and probably will, listen to it over and over again!"
3,CLASSIC INSTRUMENTAL,"I FIRST HEARD THIS SONG AROUND 1975 ON AN AUTOMATED SOFT-ROCK STATION IN SANFORD, MAINE. I WAS 15 YEARS OLD. I LOVED TOP 40 RADIO AND ITS MUSIC. I LATER BECAME A DJ AND MUSIC/PROGRAMMER.THIS SONG IS SO UNDER-RATED AND UNDER-PLAYED IT BOGGLES MY MIND. IF IT WERE PLAYED ON A CURRENT MOVIE SOUND SCORE OR USED AS A BACKDROP TO A 60'S ERA MOVIE, THIS SONG WOULD SHOOT TO THE STRATOSPHERE...WHITNESS WHAT THE MOVIE ""GHOST"" DID TO UNCHAINED MELODY BY THE RICHEOUS BROTHERS. IT RECEIVED MAJOR RADIO AIRPLAY, IT WAS HEARD ON BAKGROUND MUSIC IN STORES, IT WAS HEAVILY REQUESTED AT WEDDING AND RECORD HOPS...HOPEFULLY, THIS WILL NEVER HAPPEN TO THIS SONG. I FEEL CERTAIN SONGS ARE BEST LEFT UNTOUCHED BY THOSE WHO MAY OTHERWISE RUIN THEM (INCLUDING SOME RADIO PROGRAMMERS). IT IS RARELY PLAYED ON OLDIES STATION, AND HARLDY PLAYED ON ""MUSIC OF YOUR LIFE"" OR MOR STATIONS. BUT, BUY THE CD AND SPREAD THE WORD TO YOUR CLOSEST FRIENDS, THEY WILL FOREVER THANK YOU FOR IT!"
4,"Yes, it is the original","Like most people looking for music that is 40 to 50 years old, I am leery of purchasing ""oldies"" CD's because many are (bad) remakes by different musicians. This one is the real thing. This is a pretty obscure album but I found it on Amazon."
4,"nice high chair, modern yet normal","I was debating between this and the stokke and some other fancy adjustable high chairs. I like that it looks like our regular furniture and will look nice for a long time, since everything for babies is plastic, I wanted to avoid that for the dining room. I really like the high chair. I'd use a different alan wrench as the one it comes with will strip the bolts over time. But I like the chair very much. Kettler makes nicely designed well thought out products."
3,Great theme discussed in an academic language.,"The theme of truth is essential for the growing of all Christians. We cannot forget that the Word of God is the truth we all have to understand. This book, even though, describing the subject in a deep level is, certainly, destined for the academic. The lay person will feel more comfortable reading a book like ""The Truth War"" by John Macarthur (not that the message is different, but presented in a simpler form). Dr. Albert Mohler's chapter is the highlight of this book, not only for the message, but aldo the language used."
4,used issue of cleto,Was like New! I was suprised to see it in such great shape!. We watched it right away and laughed the entire time. I would recommend this to anyone. the only thing is I wish it was longer than what it was.
3,"Some very good sections, solid overall","The beginning on Oppenhiemer and Teller is fascinating as is some of the stuff on Truman and Eisenhower however the sections on pop culture feel rushed and underwritten. Also there are alot of typos and other editing problems. Obviously it is extremely hard to adaquately cover all of the things that happened in the 50s and individuals will differ on which issues merit more or less coverage. The international events distract from the domestic narrative IMMO. It feels like it should have been two, more complete books, US domestic events and US internationally in the 50s."
4,A GREAT INSIGHT FOR ANYONE WHO DIDN'T LIVE IN THE 50'S,"I learned so much about the decade of the 50's in this book! Everyone knows a lot about the 1960's, but the 50's also have some great stories to tell. From politics, McDonald's, and Korea to the beginning of TV, Halberstam covers it all.If you like non-fiction, this is a good one."
5,Wonderful book!,"As someone who was a teen-ager in the 50s, I can say this book is outstanding. It covers all the issues thatdefined that time in our history, and it covers them in a manner I can readily remember and identify with. I couldn'trecommend it more highly."
4,The Soil of the Counter-Cultural Revolution,"A thorough, in-depth investigation into an era that gets too much credit for being another era of the ""good ol' days"" when there was much social, cultural, and political turmoil that is responsible for founding the counter-cultural revolution of the sixties."
2,Were the fifties this boring in real life?,"Ugh! Well-researched, but ultimately poorly written historical account. In fact, this is one of the most overrated historical works I've ever encountered; there is nothing readable or memorable about the sluggish prose, which trails on for 700+ agonizing pages. On the bright side, now that I've read this ""seminal"" account, I never have to read it again."
4,"good book, a little slanted","I light history of selected events that took place in the Fifties. The book tended to try break the common memory of the fifties as being a perfect time. That purpose got into the way of some of the stories. The slant was just a little too much for me. Being rather young, I did like hearing about the way things were back then. I wish there was more information on culture and less on politics. The politics can be found in most history books. This book caused much reflection of what I remember about the seventies. I now regard the past in a more objective manner. Good but a little disappointing."
1,Can't be trusted,"I picked this book up, and read the first few pages, getting to the point where Halberstam mentions the perjury conviction of Alger Hiss. Now, as Herbert L. Packer once wrote inEx-Communist Witnesses:Four Studies in Fact Finding, the trial proved Hiss's guilt as thoroughly as a legal proceeding can prove anything. And Allen Weinstein, inPerjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case, found even more evidence of Hiss's guilt. For a historian to pretend, as Halberstam does, that there's some doubt about Hiss's guilt, and not give evidence, tells me that he's writing propoganda rather than history. When he adds in gratuitous gay-bashing (Whittaker Chambers was bisexual. What's that got to do with Hiss's guilt or innocence?), I drop the book in disgust. Your mileage may vary.So read this book if you want, but remember the author is a liar, and don't use it as a reliable source. Check other sources about anything he says, including ""The sky is blue,"" because he isn't honest."
4,I didn't read this book. I don't know how the review got posted with my name!,"UPDATE June 2010: I didn't write this review. I don't know who did and I've never read this book. I did a search of my reviews and found this under my name and now I'm wary of any reviews I read on Amazon.Halberstam tells a great story of the fifties and the lead into the sixties via great stories and ancedotes. Easy reading and engrossing. A great history book and fun to read, very insightful as well. Typical Halberstam an editor would be a good idea."
5,"To Understand America, Read This Book","So much of what America became famous for is explained in this book. The 50s were so defining for America's development. Halberstam talks about everything that started then and more: highways, hotels, Mc Donald's, Elvis, politics, the anti-baby pill, suburbia, racism and so much more. There are great photographs in the middle of the book, too. And Halberstam's ability to tell history in an anecdotal way makes it an easy and entertaining read. Great for the classroom, too, but probably quite neglected. This book explains so much of which we only know so little. GET IT!"
