2,Disappointing,"I awaited the arrival of this book with much enthusiasm. However when it arrived I was disappointed. I prefer Glynis McCants' take on numerology. Her book ""Glynis Has Your Number"" is much easier to read and to understand."
5,Great big dog toy,Sent this to my son for his Old English Sheep dog. Huge dog --he loves it. Very strong material. Great toy!
4,Blows away the comp.,This frisbee is way more stout than others! it's 2 months old and is showing no wear.
5,durable for tons of fun,"My dog Gracie is addicted to this toy ... she goes through about 1 every 3 months. Every other dog toy we have found lasts about 3 hours. This is well made, and stands up to the most aggressive teeth, and flies well to boot. Highly recommended, especially for big dogs."
5,Excellent and tough,"I am purchasing another one of these-not because my dog destroyed the first one but because we ran over it with the lawn mower. Here is the amazing thing-dispite a riding lawn mower attempting to chew it up (the blades on the mower are newly sharpened), it only made a minor hole. The frisbee still flies but isn't as predictable. We have been through numerous other frisbees and none hold up to my german shepard-only this one has. We have tried the flying squirrel and the kong-both of which he prefers but the flying squirrel is destroyed in less the 1 week and the kong in about 4 weeks-that is too expensive of a habit. And he likes this one perfectly fine if the other choices aren't available. He will not use any type of plastic frisbee.So, if you have a dog rough on frisbees try this one-it really is tough!!! Even John Deere couldn't put it out of commission!!Tami"
5,Best frisbee ever!,Love this Frisbee! It's fantastic! My dalmatian who can chew through ANYTHING can go about six months with one of these before he finally gets to the paper in the center. Well worth every cent I've spent on them. (I've gone through about 6 of them in a 3 year time span.)
4,Better than the rest,"I have now had this for a month or two now. The product is still in one piece, with no holes chewed through the middle. My dog's chewing has frayed the sides of the toy. Usually by now, a disk toy like this has been completely destroyed, but this one hasn't. It still flies and does it's job.Update- The toy is now completely destroyed. It is only half the size, but surprising still flys a little bit. My dog has completely enjoyed destroying this since it took longer than usual!"
4,Excellent product... my dog likes it !!!,"As advertised, this flying disk is very soft and pliable yet seems extremely durable.... plus it flies really well. Very satisfied overall and definitely recommend this product for dogs that like to catch frizbees on the fly."
2,short-lived,i would not buy again. i purchased it for commercial use and it just did not stand up to the challenge. not a bad product when new but quickly failed in functionality. plastic grip and sprayer are too fragile for commercial use
2,HGR271,it only works with its propietary application. Trying to use it with other GPS enable application is a waste of time.
4,Fast fix and recognized immediately by TomTom on Dell X51v,"I bought this for my Dell X51v, flashed with WM6.1, using TomTom gps software. Tom Tom recognized immediately, no driver installation is required. Once i had problem with No-GPS while driving, after i restart my pda, everything works fine.Now i can carry just dell x51v and car charger, design simplified.I also had bluetooth holux gps it works fantastic.Good pcmcia gps.Many ppl comment about documentation. As long as you know what you do, i dont feel the need for much documentation. It is nice to have better documentation.Over all i am happy with purchase."
5,more than an introduction,"That's how I look at this masterpiece, Charles Mingus allow us to be part of the band, one of the guys while listening this cd. I am not going to make the terrible mistake of writing about a track in particular because I do not believe that's fair but I have to say that none of the track are alike.A masterpiece to have."
3,Just ok,I was backpacking in Europe and can't say this was very practical. The elastic stretched and I didn't really use it. Just kept my passport and money inside it and kept it in my pack.
3,Does its job,Title says it all. Dont expect anything more from this belt. It gets the job done! One size fits all and the straps felt baggy on me and I have a 28 waist.
2,Cheap Strap and Buckle that doesn't stay secured,"I ordered this money belt with confidence after reading the reviews (4.5 stars with 44 reviews). I was disappointed when the money belt arrived. The pouch itself is great--it is a good size and well constructed. However the strap is really stretchy and cheap and the buckle is so flimsy and cheap. The strap doesn't actually stay tight in the buckle and needs to be secured with either a safety pin or a knot. It slips off VERY easily, not exactly the security most people are looking for when carrying their valuables.I don't usually write reviews, but I felt that if I had read more reviews about the cheap straps and buckle, it would have prevented me from making this mistake. I'm really surprised how many people gave it such high marks..."
5,Perfect,"I carried this in the Philippines for 3 weeks. I kept the credit cards and large sums of foriegn currency in it. The inside stayed dry and it was humid over there. You might want to hand wash it before use to get the color or chemicals out? I got a small rash right below the BB the first week, but it cleared up and no further problems. As for the long strap, I doubled it over and sewed the extra together, no problem. It could be cut, but I opted to just sew it.Very light and nicely constructed. It has two pouches with zippers on both. I looked around alot and this is the best!Recommended!"
2,Poorly made strap,"This travel belt is good in theory, but it is too wide for comfort especially when seated. A design problem is that the belt is not secure. It easily lengthens during normal wear so that the bag is not snug against your body. I do not recommend this bag!"
3,The clasp was iffy,"I have used money belts and similar products while traveling in 3rd world countries; I have ample experience using these products. I just got mine out of the box and the clasp simply doesn't work. It is flimsy, and would not work in the strains of travel. I am reluctant to use this product to store my valuables.UPDATE: For some odd reason the clasp didn't work as first, but after a few tries it was solid - I've used it since and had no problems."
1,Contains antimicrobial additive,The product itself is ok but it contains an antimicrobial additive. The origin of this additive is not indicated on the packaging so there is no way to know if it represents a potential health hazard. Better safe than sorry.
3,Eagle Creek Travel Gear,"We recently traveled out of the country. We were advised to obtain a money belt. The Eagle Creek Travel Gear was purchased. I used it for one week to hold money, passport (or copy of the passport) and credit cards. It had appropriate compartments for each. The zippers worked well and were recessed when closed for comfort. After reading other reviews I was concerned that it would slip or not be comfortable. I found the elastic band was adequate. I did not like having the gear in front of my body or on the back. I preferred to wear it on my left side under a shirt, which I left untucked, and partially pushed down under my pant's belt. Sometimes I wore it inside out to cover the zipper next to my body. It was more comfortable wearing an undershirt between the gear and my body. I would definitely recommend it for the price and usefulness."
1,disappointing,This item was disappointing. The belt size did not hold and I was not able to wear it around my waist. It wound up in my purse which was what I was trying to avoid.
3,"Solid Drive, software questionable",I don't know about longevity because I just bought it but my PC had no problem rcognizing this drive. The bundled software used to copy my old disk to this one isn't working however and so I will probably have to go with some 3rd party software to switch disks completely. If you are just looking for some reasonably priced extra room this is a good bet. One more star if I get my rebate.
2,Laminating Pouches,I returned these. I don't have a laminating machine and didn't realize these pouches require one in order to seal them.
1,NOT 4 MM,"Altough these are advertised as 4 MIL laminating sheets, they are NOT! More like 2 or 3 ML. Very disappointing!"
5,Translation of Arab Christian Philosopher,"Yahya ibn 'Adi is a little known (in the West) Arab philosopher and theologian who lived in medieval Baghdad and was a student of the great Abu Nasir al-Farabi. While he wrote in Arabic, he was not a Muslim, but rather an Syrian Orthodox Christian. He is an important figure in medieval Islamic philosophy as he translated Syriac books of philosophy (themselves translated from the original Greek) into Arabic, thus making figures like Aristotle accessible to later Arab philosophers.This book, while short, provides an excellent introduction and summary of Aristotelian ethical philosophy. The translation is very good (and provides the Arabic original as well) and the introduction by Professor Griffith gives a very clear picture of Yahya ibn 'Adi and his ideas. For anyone interested in medieval Arab philosophy, the history of Eastern Christianity, or Aristotelian thought this volume is a must read."
4,Straight to the point,"The title of this video validates its content as it is a well put together and does not waste time. I would recommend this video for anyone interested in massaging their partner. It has an introduction that made me subtract one star along with the fact that the footage seems old (based on the hairsyles of the actors/participants). However, the techniques are good."
3,good but could have been better,it had alot of good techniques and instruction but i wish he would of spent more time on instruction and technique and no time on the history of massage or the attempts at humor(those parts were just a waste of film)
2,Made in 1989? I don't think so!,"Unless Gordon traveled in a time machine back to those good old hip-hugging, bell-bottom days of the 70's to make this film I don't think this was made anywhere close to 1989! I had seen the original but was dissatisfied with the quality of the cinematography (not to mention the very hairy models). When I saw the date on this video I assumed Gordy had re-done his 70's wonder. Sadly it is not so."
2,unnecessary background which takes away from massage itself.,"I felt too much time was spent on unnecessary background and not enough time on technique. Different kinds of strokes could be mentioned, even getting more into the ""sensual""."
3,"Light, fun, efficient and understandable!","Gookin presents Windows 2000 Professional in such a way that the reader will remain interested in learning all the necessary skills to navigate and employ this OS successfully. It holds your hand as you explore the Desktop, the Start button, and teaches you essentially what all those gadgets do and how to change things to work your way. The easy way. After all, isn't that what a good OS is for? - This is not for advanced users or MCSE candidates. If you dread reading technical books, this is for you!"
3,Fast but lacking...,"This flash drive may be fast, but it lacks several important features. First, it has no LED light to show you when it is ""thinking"", running the risk of damaging files if you remove it while it's working. Second, the drive comes without a wrist strap and clip, an inconvenience. Finally, it's light and tiny, which some would consider an advantage but it's almost too easy to lose. (The SanDisk Cruzer solves all these problems.)"
4,poor customer service,"Nice fountain however, it did not have variable settings as stated in the advertisement. When we called/emailed the company for clarification, we did NOT get a response."
4,Blissful Pop!,"Wow is really all I can say on this one! This album was given to me as a gift last week and I can't seem to get it out of the player--it's got perfect songs for nearly any mood and the girls' vocals are just shimmering on each one. My personal favorites are ""Last Thing"", ""Nice Day"" and ""Saddest Day"" (funny they have a song for each type of day but the sentiment on each is just right!) Definitely an album I'd whole-heartedly reccomend!"
3,Overrated,"We bought one of these because they looked cool. But, it did not work well when bowed and was more of a pain than it was worth. Instead buy a cheap Korg tuner and a cheap clip on pickup for your bridge. Even with an entire orchestra class playing, they still work great."
1,Pathetic,"I have owned (2) of these-they both ate batteries, and the second one had a connection problem. Neither registered the low ""E"" well at all. Never again."
4,Not actually about black people...,"Yeah, I'm surprised too! You'd think with a title like Black Legion there'd be a ton of black people running around doing stuff, but not so much. Bogart is good and his hair is combed very carefully, but he interacts with exactly zero negros. LAME."
3,A True Story,"This movie is a gripping account of a very real problem that affected the Detroit automotive industry in the 1930's. The editorial review states that ""the script conjures up."" This movie is no conjure job. It tells a true story. My father, originally from Kentucky, went to Detroit to work in the automobile factory in the 1930's. While he was never in the Black Legion, he had enough stories to tell about it. I recommend that everyone watch this movie once."
1,Not worth the $$,Smells great! Although it attracts mosquitos. It still leave my hair slightly tangled. I have fine thin and long hair and was hoping for something great. This is not it.
5,Use on my toddlers... I love it,"I've been using this on my children since it didn't really work on my hair (too thick, too much) since they were about 18 months old and it's perfect. The only ones they have on sale for kids are too Spongebob or BERRY-tastic for my taste. I've also used other detanglers on my kids that work on my hair and their hair gets too sticky too quick."
2,"Smells great, not for my thick hair, though...","This product smells wonderful! Like fresh pear juice. I could almost drink it. Almost.It doesn't function, unfortunately, as well as it smells. At least, it doesn't work for my thick, shoulder length hair. After shampooing and conditioning my hair as usual, I sprayed this liberally over my wet hair. I did not notice any discernible difference while brushing my hair with the product on as I did without using it at all. It still took me nearly 10 minutes to completely brush my hair.It's not a complete loss for me, though, as I am able to use it on my 3 year old daughter's hair. The scent is refreshing and not overly perfumed and I love that it's organic. She has very thin, short hair that's easy to brush anyway. I do think it adds some shine to her hair and she likes having some pampering time getting ready with me. However, it's an expensive detangler for a three year old."
4,Truly detangles and smells great!,"This spray has a wonderful scent and works well to detangle wet or dry hair. We haven't had any trouble with the pump and are pleased to know that it is made from natural, organic ingredients."
4,Super scent!,"I love this product. It does what it's supposed to do, and it smells wonderful! Being sensitive to strong fragrances / scents I was happy to find that this product has a very light, natural pear scent that is really nice."
2,the smell is too much,"i bought this product assuming it was all natural, since it contained some organic ingredients. then i saw on the product ingredients containing FIVE paraben preservatives and some other chemicals.but what troubles me the most is the over-powering scent, which is mostly from fragrance/parfum. for the average consumer this would not be a problem. but for someone like me, who has been using all natural products and eating all vegan, i'm extremely sensitive to smells, especially synthetic ones.other than these two irritations, it works great as a detangler, makes brushing my hair after the shower so much easier. but i don't think i can use this product because of the smell. i had difficulty going to sleep last night because my nose felt so congested.i really wish the company would reconsider and making it preservatives free, and chemical free. i'd definitely reconsider."
4,Hard to find,"Both my daughter and I love this product and we used to be able to purchase it at my hair dresser's, then over-the-counter. No one seems to carry it anymore so it was great to find it online."
2,Not for us,"It has that very typical leave in conditioner smell. I dont know what it is but almost every leave in I have tried has this same smell, and I HATE it!!!. Other than that it is fairly nice. It detangles but is is just average to me."
4,Hot Blooded Kylie,"Despite a lesser reception for the overly underrated Body Language, there's no denying, on closer inspection that the album is one of pop's best for 2003. Red Blooded Woman is one of the songs on the album that follows a hip-hop/urban sound and to much surprise, Kylie works it effectively. In fact, I would say that Kylie does her hip hop more credibly than Jlo and Janet Jackson.Though not exactly your 8-octave lung-busting singer, Kylie has cleverly used her sensual voice to great effect here. The result is a female verison of Justin Timberlake's Cry Me A River that's not produced by The Neptunes.The othe suprise on this CD is the Chemical Brothers' remix of Slow which essentially mask the sensuous song in trademark Chem Bro electronic stutter and beats.I am looking forward to Kylie releasing the ultra-orgasmic Chocolate."
2,Careful...,"""Red Blooded Woman"" is not Kylie's best work. It sounds too much like something Britney would do! ""Cruise Control"" is a little better, but not much. Now we're stepping into J-Lo territory. The video for ""Red Blooded Woman"",like the song, is very mediocre. It seems like the director and choreographer couldn't come up with anything. The Chemical Brothers' remix of ""Slow"" is nicely done. But overall, only Kylie's die-hard fans will find this one enjoyable."
5,Great,"I bind a lot of small books for my kids for homeschooling. The 3/8 in comb is a nice size. In general, I find that I can fit a lot less pages than the maker states, so I'd recommend choosing a comb one size larger than you think you'll need. It will make the binding process easier and the pages will be easier to turn."
3,Not my favorite,I think that this shampoo is made for people with thicker strands of hair. It didn't really work well in mine.
2,Don`t like!,"My hair got worst with this shampoo: became my hair too dry!!! I expected the opposite effect! Before I use another shampoo of Loreal (Evercream, absolut repair) and I like."
5,This is the best shampoo for your weak hair...,I have been useing this for about 6 years and it really helps your hair get stronger and stops hair loss....i am very very happy about it...
3,Too many damaging sulfates,This shampoo works good but It has too many damaging sulfates. I bought the hair mask and leave in hair milk those are amazing! I would not purchase this shampoo again I would rather use an organic shapmoo with no sulfates. But I will purchase the hair mask and hair milk again.
2,doesn't do anything,"this product is overpriced and is not worth the money. I've experienced just as much or even more hair loss and the shampoo leaves my hair brittle. also, there're a LOT of harmful chemicals in the ingredient. I should have thought twice before purchasing this product."
5,great elementary intro to presidents,"My 7 yr old daughter is in 1st grade. She got this book after she had already learned the names of the presidents in order, along w/several facts (some trivial) about each. Still she poured over it to compare what she had studied w/what the book said. The small size, paperback nature, reading level, & casual drawings (like an elementary class project) make it VERY KID FRIENDLY. I understand that some adults might disagree w/which key details of each presidency were included or excluded, & that some info might be too simplified. I think the point is to understand the target audience for this book is elementary school children who will have a chance to study/grasp more in depth material later. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it for the right audience."
4,Likely best for collectors,"This would probably have a five star rating if it was made with die-cast metal as it's title suggests. My item was completely made out of plastic, but it's not all that bad. The detail is perfect and it has a plastic display stand. The barrels turn and you pull the hammers back, although I can't say I'm thrilled about it. I would handle it carefully because since it's plastic and only around 7 inches long, it's likely to be fragile. Bottom line, it's a good display and accurate replica."
4,Yea its plastic but it looks nice,"I have been a fan of final fantasy since I was a kid. So, I have always collected their replicas. I purchased these to add to my collection. Though they are made of plastic they are a nice addition to my collection. As long as I do not mess with them they should last."
1,Not the same at all...,"Sadly, friends, this one is not the same as the one offered by Square Enix at a lower price. The Square Enix model does contain die cast metal (along with some plastic). The Square Enix model is roughly the same size (5.9 inches). Also it is not discontinued by the manufacturer, in fact you can still buy it at the Square Enix store."
5,Wonderful Spiritually Juicy Book!,"This book is an inspiration! On every page, in every section there is something to draw on to expand one's spiritual and artistic expression. The mandala information is very good. The pocket shrines are also wonderful to make with or for children. They really respond to them. I was encouraged, uplifted, and inspired to create more art, and as a result learned more about me in 40 days, than I have in 10 years. If there was one art/spirituality book (that wasn't a single technique) that everyone needs for their bookshelf...it is this one. Don't miss it!"
2,I was hoping for more.,"I think most of these books are written for art therapists whose job it is to guide others. I truly would have preferred a book written which includes projects to help you progress, step by step, in drawing (or painting or whatever) for theraputic purposes. Peronally, I'm an artist with some skill, but I have a hard time coming up with images of my own imagination. I can draw from photos, and can draw from life, but I still don't know how to draw from my heart."
5,The Champagne Addict's Definitive Guide,Surely the most delicious book ever written on the fabulously glamorous subject of Champagne. A thirst quenching encyclopedia that answers all your questions and guides you through the sparkling world of this fizzy French drink. The layout is elegant and the text is on-the-dot clear. It is a beautiful book and it makes a great gift to all and everyone who wishes to indulge in Champagne know-how. A definate must-have for those who enjoy good food and good drink!
1,"poor work, instructor is too inexperienced","this is a poor quality exercise video; i was hoping the prenatal activity would be better, but its hard to do with the inconsistent instruction from the teacher, who is nice, but she doesn't exude much confidence and doesn't seem very polished at being in front of the camera, which makes a video workout hard to follow...I'd recommend Fitmama or something else, this is not very good."
2,BORING!,This is a well done DVD but what a snooze fest! It takes so long to get moving and feel like you are really exercising. I felt like I could fall asleep during this workout. As a mother of 1 with 1 on the way - I want to cut to the chase and get a good workout during my 22 month old's naptime! Buy FitMama instead - you'll get up and moving and be done before you know it!
2,Let's just say I won't be doing it again.,"This DVD is not awful, but I certainly won't be doing it again. I agree with the other reviewers that it was boring, and not a great workout. I hardly even feel stretched out, much less worked out. The arm sequence was probably my favorite, but even that was both boring and too short.Finally, she asks those of us in our third trimester to watch ""Cassie and I"" (not the real name). No - it's Cassie and ME. The bad grammar was actually really distracting. Maybe it's just because I'm hormonal, but it drove me nuts."
2,Poor Audio,"The audio on this DVD was so badly done I couldn't even bear to watch more than five minutes, let alone do any of the workout. I was really looking forward to it, but the white noise in the background is so distracting and unnerving it wasn't worth the annoyance."
2,Blah!,"I was excited to see another pilates exercise tape on the market since the other ones got such bad reviews. But this one seems like it must be as bad. First of all it is excrutiatingly boring. The instructor is boring and the exercises are boring. It seems to take forever for the instructor to tell us about the exercise, then she can't even figure out her left from her right. Yikes. I too am a mother of one with one on the way so I have to do my exercises right before bed, I don't have a lot of time to waste. It's too bad that I wasted my money because I dread doing this tape, but make myself do it since I paid for it.The other tape I use - and love - is the Perfect Pregnancy Workout. Look for it, use, love it! Don't bother with Leisa Hart's fit mama, that is horrible too.Happy working out!"
4,"Long, slow paced workout","As an avid pilates person, I bought this video to keep doing some of it during my pregnancy. This video is LONG, and it incorporates a lot of yoga-like moves (slow and deliberate). The stretches are wonderful and I feel very good after doing it. It is just time consuming (57 minutes) and forced me to rearrange my workout schedule just to get this in once per week. You can see how some of these moves will definitely help with the birth and recovery. This video does focus on the whole body and is easy to follow. Gianni is so pleasant I almost feel bad about complaining about the lenght of time it takes. All in all, a thorough full body workout that leaves you feeling energized and relaxed."
3,50/50,"While I did like some of the exercises, I wouldn't recommend this for a beginner as I don't think she instructs to that level. You really need to know what you're doing or you might do some poses incorrectly. I felt like the breathing was backwards to what my yoga teachers normally teach, which was strange.I was really disappointed that she wasn't backed up with other pregnant ladies. Who wants to be 8 months pregnant watching skinny minnies doing the exercises? There are some good exercises in there though.I would say get a couple of other DVDs and mix it up. I've got FitMama and ZenMama.Just for reference I've done yoga for around 7 years and have exercised regularly most of my life."
2,Very little challenge for women who are active pre-pregnancy,This workout has some great stretching but was not a challenge for someone who is newly pregnant and already active. I was looking for something that would make me sweat or really tone muscles enough that I could feel a difference.I would recommend this workout for women in their third trimester or women who did not workout before pregnancy.
3,Not for beginners,"I'm sure this is a great video for someone who is already comfortable with yoga. It was more yoga than pilates to me, and I am used to pilates. Also, some of the moves were uncomfortable for me. She narrates for 1st and 2nd trimesters to do certain moves and 3rd trimesters a more modified version. This could have worked in my first pregnancy since I didn't really start to show until I was around 5 months. However, this is my 2nd and by 5 months my belly is already quite large, making some of the poses quite difficult and uncomfortable. The dvd also requires props, such as a dowel, some free weights, and a chair. I could find a chair in my house that would work, but was disappointed that I had to go purchase other things because that was not written on the dvd cover. Or if it was, I certainly couldn't find it (I checked). However, if you are experienced with yoga and already have what is necessary, I am sure that you will enjoy the workout."
1,good for...well...nothing!,"This tape is good for nothing. A huge waste of money, wont be buying anymore of these. these moves are not enough to keep the blood flowing or help maintain weight during pregnancy."
1,Look elsewhere,"If you currently do pilates than this is NOT the workout for you. It will seem very slow & ineffective. I wish I didn't need to listen to the instructions throughout the DVD every time and wish there were options for a 10 or 15 min workout. Between being tired with the pregnancy, working full time and having a toddler I just can't fit in the full hour workout."
2,Save it for third tri-mester,"I found this dvd extremely boring (maybe because of the dull yoga elements), but it may be helpful if I can't keep up with Winsor Pilates in the third tri-mester. The program is long (no way you can do this before work) and requires a lot of random equipment that will send you combing through your house for an hour."
1,Not the typical Kerastase,This product simply seems to separate the hair and make it stiff. I have not noticed any instant or long-term benefits. I was surprised since I have used Kerastase for years.
1,I spent how much for this sticky mess?,"Oh please tell me I didn't fall for the hype, but I guess I did. Very disappointed. Saw the five star review and thought, yes! But no, this product is just ineffective. Nutri-sculpt simply does not do anything...nothing. Truly, nothing. It's actually quite stunning. My hair is stickier but who wants that? Buy something else. Their shampoo is good, but this stuff, a real waste. Wish I could send it back and demand a refund. Can I do that?"
5,Nothing like #30!,"I don't understand most people who have reviewed this book! THey might sound a little similar, but #30 and this one are nothing alike! This book was really intresting and moving. I liked it because it didn't have really big and boring battles, and was much more subtle and undercover. I thought the animorphs thought of some really intresting plots in this one, instead of just doing the same old thing. Jake's grandpa's death was woven into the story, with comparisons between the battles that his granpa was in and the battle Jake's fighting now, instead of just being there to make the plot work. This was one of the best animorph books ever and definitly the best Jake book ever."
1,I've lost my love for Animorphs now...,"I totally agree with the reader from Florida ( June 17th ). This is getting ridiculous. Every book has a great plot when you hear it and then in the ending, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING CHANGES!!!! It's so boring now - K.A. Applegate can't keep doing this. Her first books were utterly no doubt amazing but now you have to admit, it's just for the money now. We have to pay almost 8 bucks ( here in Canada after tax ) for one book and it turns out to be lousy. Tell me when the last book comes out - THEN I'll read it."
1,Too familiar,"I normally love Ms. Applegate's writing ( I mean, obviously since I have every Animorphs book ) but this one was kind of boring. It was too close in dialogue to number thirty except that it's Marco and his mom instead of Jake and his dad. I just didn't find that it appealed to my interest very much. I hope she can do better and create new ideas because as long as the books keep coming, I'll read them."
2,Just like #30,"Y'know, when I first heard about #30, I'm like ""cool,"". I bought it (I buy every single one, whether it sounds interesting or not) and I read it. Sure, it had it's funny moments, but I wasn't exstatic about it. Sorry, I usually love Animorphs, obsessed, even, I really do (hehe, you should see my walls, Aniposters GALoRE!), but that was just...boring! I became angry when I read #31. It was the same thing! The only real differences was that the main character was Jake and the parent-in-danger was his father and wasen't a known-controller. Ms/Mrs Applegate. If you're reading this, I'm really sorry. I understand the message you may have been trying to give (family is importent, things are harder when you're so closely involved etc.) and you did it, but those books just didn't live up to the other Animorphs books. I must admit, however, I am looking forward to #32 The Seperation. It's a completely different plot. :-)"
1,The book is badly written and has huge gaps.,"Prospective readers should heed the following warnings:(1) The term ""cellular"" is used here in the restrictive sense that excludes the PCS band.(2) The author may know his subject, but his grasp of English grammar and syntax is pathetic.(3) Much of the material piled together here was already obsolete in the first edition, let alone the second."
4,Better than I expected.,"A pretty good western I ended up watching again and again.George Chesebro, usually seen in lesser roles as a bad guy, steals the show here in a most heroic way and even tugs at the ol' heartstrings. Another big plus was the casting of a number of Arapaho Indian survivors of the actual Little Bighorn battle. That moved ""Custer's Last Stand"" w-a-a-y up on my list of must-have serials."
2,It could have been a great book but.......,"I wish I could have had the ability to cut and paste on this book.When it did get around to covering the actual material it was great. However it took so much to wade through the ""fluff"" and I have to agree the zen stuff was a bit much. I guess I have to say it's like plastering makeup on a beautiful woman..it just takes away from everything."
2,Bloated but usefull,"The book is pretty mediocre...Discussion of concepts is thin and padded nonsense is vast. It is, however, reasonably useful if you are going specifically for the CNA exam."
4,"It'll get the job done and then some but,","This book is an excellent source to study and prepare you to pass the CNA exam with a minimal amount of effort, it's just probably not going to be opened again after you pass the exam. A reference/resource kit for future use it's not. Do yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks and get the CNE study guide. It has the same content and then some, and it's a great sidekick for reference on the job!"
3,"A great study manual, *BUT*","The narrative is fabulous and covers what's on the test and more. There is a great deal of real-world information and preparation that will put you one step ahead of the ""paper CNAs"" However, It is not great for after-the-fact reference. I also feel that you would do better getting the CNE guide by the same author and receiving a better value. Virtually all of the CNA test is WORD FOR WORD in the CNE book, and sometimes the texts refer to each other's certification. Also, I LOATHED the testing software. Still, the 5 reflects this title only, not the author and not the CNE Guide."
1,Looking for another book!,I didn't log on to review this book but to search for another. I have to agree with most of the other reviewers. I haven't taken the exam yet because after going over and over this book I have no confidence that I can pass the exam. All the extra fluff was terribly distracting! I couldn't keep track of where he was going most of the time. I passed my MCSE self study in 4 months. So I don't think its just me. I going to try another author.
1,Is it bad comedy or certification material????,"This is the worst series of books I have ever used in any certification program. You get to read quotes from Jerry Seinfeld, but I doubt that he could set up a Novell Network, what is the point??? The same info over and over and in no particular order, the author jumps back and forth and never fully explains any one topic. . . Save your time and money, either get some real world experience or find a class because this is not going to help you certify"
4,Good enough to pass the exam,"This book was designed for you to pass the exam. It is well written, organized and the examples and case studies are plentiful. The Clarke Test 3.0 is a good bonus that comes with this book however is not sufficient. You should get the CNEQUIZER as well to ensure success. The CNA module is inexpensve (far cheaper than the Big Red Test). The Clarke Test, CNEQUIZER and this Study Guide is all you need to pass this exam. It sure did help me."
1,Disappointing,"Although it was all I used to pass the test, I was not impressed by the style. Following the course objectives in the appendix caused me to read the book in a strange order and often needlessly cover the same material several times.The Zen more accurately could be termed Zit (Zero interesting trivia).Get rid of the trivia, reorder the material, and supply sample tests that accurately reflect the Novell exams and you'll have a textbook."
3,Some verbal instructions would be helpful,"This is a good video to watch in tandem with the book of the same title. It makes the moves a lot clearer. The problem is, you need the book to be able to get an idea as to how to do the moves yourself, as there are no actual verbal instructions on the DVD. So, if you want to learn this form, buy both the book and the DVD."
4,Perfect,The parts were exactly as ordered and nicely packaged. They cleaned up for soldering and heated the same. Should be packaged with the pump and not sold as a separate item. Need to think this through from the pump manufacturer view point as I had to wait on the pump to arrive before I knew for sure if the unions were a part of the pump package. 4 Stars for that.
3,Mein goodness! Ass meat for the conoisseur!,"This is the most comprehensive available review of ass meat and other edible offals available in today's ass meat market. The more you need to know about ass meat, the more you need this book."
4,Another Winner,"""Tarab"" is another very good album from Rabih Abou-Khalil. It is a blend of middle-eastern music with jazz. The solos by Rabih Abou-Khalil (oud) and Selim Kusur (nay) are excellent, supported by the rhythms from Nabil Khaiat (frame drums, percussion), Ramesh Shotham (South Indian drums, percussion), and Glen Moore (bass). The album starts with ""Bushman In The Desert"" which builds wonderfully, and it concludes with the wonderful ""Arabian Waltz"". Other interesting pieces include ""Awakening"", ""Haneen Wa Hanaan"", and ""A Tooth Lost""."
5,One of the wildest rides ever...,"Framed is one of the wildest stories of fame, fortune and destruction I've read. It's a similar story to Bruce McNall's book, It Was Fun While It Lasted. Every page has gems that can only be learned by going through the school of hard knocks on both coasts. It's also a crash course for anyone considering buying art or collectibles because the prices and values are illusions that are seldom based in reality. Volpe generously reveals the inner workings of the art world, which is largely revealed as a pool of fraud."
2,Unmasked,If ever there was an argument for the appointment of a ghost writer this book is it. An interesting tale told appallingly and in a self serving cringe enducing manner. If you feel you must purchase the tome wait for the paperback edition. The book and its contents will not have mellowed with time but you will save a few dollars
1,Sad Journey,"Framed is a painfully sad and unsatisfying slog through the underbelly of the commercial art world of late 20th century New York. Painful, because Volpe's quest to seal deals at any cost (usually to his reputation and dignity) is described in the semi-literate prose of someone (and his publisher) who could not be bothered to write for a reader's understanding. Unsatisfying, too, because even if readers were able to look beyond the arrogant jargon they likely may not feel any of the promised remorse for deeds that led to a jail sentence. It seems a hollow mea culpa of convenience. Worse, one cannot help feeling that memories of the company of celebrities is what Volpe clings to yet as solace for a career of deceit. I confess I could not finish reading this book."
2,You Think The Man Would Know How To Spell Georgia O'Keeffe,"But alas he does not. (And I checked the index, to see whether it was just a typo. It's not.) And he tried to go against some federal prosecutors and the FBI? The sloppiness of the book and the ego on display makes for pretty easy insight on how he wound up in prison. Spend your money on a book about either art or business, or even about criminal justice, but not this-- it misses a mark on all three."
5,Amazing,"Length:: 2:17 MinsBe warned, the two disks are not alike. Just when you think its a smooth ride, up comes the hill that never ends. These videos take you right into it. You feel like you are there too. A lot of fun, but you can feel the intensity. Great."
3,Perhaps the best of the James Horne serials,"Watching this serial can almost give almost the same pleasure as watching a good Laurel and Hardy short. One of Horne's techniques was to use the villains as butts for some humorous jabs. James Craven (head villain) is a hoot as he rants and raves against his blundering underlings; when he isn't doing this he is correcting their English or juicily dreaming up some more deviltry. Sarcastic end of chapter narrations also add to the fun--""Is Bellamy giving his gang a pep talk?"", etc. Hilarious last shot in chapter 15: Victor Jory while going upstairs suddenly clutches a shield and covers his derriere to protect himself against the arrows of a future green archer."
5,R. Carr,"Ms. Carr has again created another wonderful story.In my mind, she is the best. I keep buying her books."
2,Big disaster,I have read every book written by Robyn Carr. I wait until they are out and rush to buy them. This book was one of the worst books I have ever read. In trying to profile each character in the book she wrote a very long and drawn out boring book. I felt like I could not wait for this book to end. She had some great characters but did not seem to know what to do with them. There were parts that I thought Robyn Carr was back and it was an okay read. And than it would drag on and on. I would not ever tell anyone to read this book.
3,Robyn Carr's House on Olive Street,I love Robyn Carr's Virgin River series and the Grace Valley series.This is book is one of Robyn's older ones. It was slow getting started. There are a lot of characters to get to know all at once. It seems a little disjointed. It lacks some of her clarity.I haven't finished it yet; but I will. I am hoping it starts to flow a little better.
3,not as good as most Robyn Carr's,"I just Loved Robyn's Virgin River Series and am keeping those books, which is rare for me. Plan to reread them in the future.I usually give books away after reading them.I was so looking fwd to this one, kept thinking it'd be more interesting, but never got to that point.disappointing to not be able to love it !Looking fwd to the new books she has coming out ~~~"
5,It just gets better...,"Honestly, I had a difficult time getting into the book for the first few chapters, but suddenly I was hooked and by the middle of the book I couldn't put it down. The characters are all so complex and you find yourself really pulling for them all. Like other Robyn Carr books, I find that The House on Olive Street gives a well-rounded picture of many different characters and their lives. It is not just centered on one or two major players. Definitely recommend."
1,Boring,"The only Robyn Carr book I've ever closed up after a few chapters. I, actually, deleted this book from my Kindle. I have so many of her books that I really enjoyed. She must have needed to send something in fast when she wrote this YAWN!"
3,The House on Olive Street,This was not one of my favorite Robyn Carr books.....have read several of her works and this was my least favorite.
2,I thought the book was very boring and difficult to get into. It took a long time to read this book. Would not recommend.,"I usually enjoy all of Robyn Carr's books. However, this book was very slow and rather boring from the start. It took a longtime to get into the book. I would not recommend this book to anyone to read."
4,I quite enjoyed this story.,The novel was realistic and I could identify with segments of the story! The only thing I did not like was that the story was not quite finished for some characters...maybe a follow up? The ending as in many of the novels lately was rushed as if the author was tired of the story!
4,Entertaining Read by Carr,"This is not one of my favorite Robyn Carr books, but it held my interest after the first few chapters. For me, the start was a bit slow. I wanted to get right into the main characters' stories a bit more quickly. For those of us with children, there are some laughable""I can relate"" moments between Barbara Ann and her family. Despite the slowish start, I would recommend this book for Robyn Carr fans."
5,The Power of Friendship,"This is one of the best female friendships stories I have ever read. Four women, Elly, Sable, Barbara Ann, and Beth are drawn together by the death of their friend Gabby. All four women are writers, and all four women are experiencing difficulties in their lives. As they spend the summer sorting through Gabby's personal papers, they come together in friendship and support.This is a wonderful story, as each character's story is presented separately, yet they are connected tightly throughout the novel. Each character has a secret, but until they can admit to the truth in their lives, they cannot move on."
5,Penthouse 2000 Winner= High Quality DVD,"First of all Penthouse and General Media have outdone themselves with the most explicit and ,yet top notch quality(models,various backgrounds,directing,camera angles)with Penthouse class to add to the viewers keen sense of visual imagery. Secondly Juliet has to be one of the most glamorous models I have ever seen(natural brunette,with blue eyes,very exotic looking) and also the Penthouse Runner-Up /Alexus Winston is a major cutie too(blondish/brown hair,green eyes,killer body),however the last model was fairly plain especially when compared to (Juliet and Alexus)she is plain but ok I suppose. Lastly Penthouse did a great job with the extras(Photo Galleries from the actual Penthouse magazine layouts)which makes for a spectacular DVD all together.In Conclusion please don't cheat yourself by not buying this classic Penthouse DVD before it goes OOP and becomes hard to find. Reviewed By Thantos"
5,EROTIC ART AT IT'S BEST .......,"THIS D.V.D IS ONE OF THE MOST EROTIC AND SENSUAL PENTHOUSEHAS EVER MADE. JULIET, ALEXUS AND AIMEE SWEET LOOK AMAZINGIN WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A MASTERPIECE.THE SCENES ARE LONG, AND NOTHING IS HELD BACK, AS THETHREE GIRLS SHOW ALL OF THEIR FANTASTIC BODIES IN THISWONDERFUL PRODUCTION. THE PICTURE QUALITY IS SUPERB.THIS IS EROTIC ART AT IT'S FINEST. A PENTHOUSE CLASSIC.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. ( IF YOU LIKE THIS, YOU WILLALSO LIKE "" PETS IN PARADISE "" )"
3,Not What I Expected,"The video features - 2000 Pet of the Year, Juliet - First Runner-Up, Alexus Winston - Second Runner-Up, Aimee Sweet. I guess it's true what they say; Penthouse videos are more revealing than Playboy videos (i.e. you get to see more flesh). The video itself was good; I didn't like Aimee Sweet's performance, however. Aimee Sweet acts like a porn star in this one - she opens her mouth and moans as if she's enjoying it - and ruined the video for me; if I wanted to see that kind of acting, I would've gotten myself some hardcore porno (which I'm not into)."
2,Not what I expected,"I feel that this video was a waste of my twenty dollars. Most of the video consists of solo scenes of the three women. There is only one scene with Aimee and Juliet and only one with all three of them. There is no hardcore action here. At the end of the video I was left with the feeling ""that was it?"""
2,Pet of the Year 2000,I was very disappointed in the DVD. I really like Juliet and think she is beautiful and of course she is that and the other two Pets are nice looking also. The problem I have with the DVD is that it's boring. You can see how fake the scenes are with the girls together and all they do is touch tongues. I was fast forwarding throughout the DVD hoping to find a good part. I'll never purchase another Penthouse DVD again. I'm giving it 2 stars only because the girls are good looking.
5,Excellent,"This ""Pet of the year"" DVD is really good. It features Juliet Carriega, Alexus Winston and Aimee Sweet. The three girls, and above all Aimee Sweet, are really beautiful. The scenes are long enough, and it is a pleasure to see those threes beauties evolving in different sceneries. Once again, Penthouse shows us how gifted they are to film beautiful women (this has nothing to do with a playboy's DVD ..."
2,On the Ground Looking Up,"This is a pretty good DVD especially if you are into the war scene. Having been in Vietnam I only saw the air war from the groung looking up. This gave a good perspective of what the air war was all about. Having Charlton Heston narate is a nice touch. All in all, worth the money."
5,Get's the job done,"It's just a normal mouse pad, not too big, just the right size for my needs really.I'm not so sure about all the antimicrobial stuff goes, I just wanted a cheep mouse pad, and this one fit the bill. Works fine with my Microsoft wireless optical mouse, no jumping issues."
2,Not too good for Laser mice,"If you have a laser mouse, this is a bad product. The mouse pad was built for roll wheel mouses. The mouse pad makes the laser inaccurate, so it is harder to navigate around. So this mouse is good for all mice except for old laser mice."
2,Great mouse pad.... for a little while,"I bought one of these. Loved it. Then bought 2 more based on my experience with the first. Now that it's been in use for exactly 3 months and 1 day, the fancy cloth cover is coming off. It has had medium to heavy use as the pad for our main home computer, used by myself, my wife, and my 2 older kids. To pay this amount for something I can only use for 3 months just isn't acceptable. I was hoping it was an anomaly, but I also noticed that the one that I took to work is starting to come apart at the edges. I guess it's time to look elsewhere."
3,Good,"I got this, then gave it away. I forgot why I gave it away, but I think it was because it was too thin and unstable. I replaced it with what I recollect is a Belkin, and it is fine. It does not move when I move my mouse, fits better next to my keyboard."
1,Warning eats desk finish,DO not buy this pad if you have a wood finish surface. I purchased the Microban mouse pad six weeks ago. To my horror when I removed the pad there was a clear outline of the pad in my new $7000 desk Apparently the black non stick-surface of this pad can react with certain wood finishes. I can't recommend this pad unless your desktop is a non wood surface.
5,better than the one it replaced,"The other mousepad was a quarter of an inch thick and and all the corners were raised up.So this mousepad was well worth the money,and is working great.It's made from rubber so I dont think the sides coming apart or rolling up will not be a problem.Thanks"
1,IntelliMouse Explorer 2.0 Will Not Work Properly With Pad,I have a wireless Microsoft IntelliMouse Explorer 2.0 optical mouse. The mouse pointer will not move properly with this mouse pad. I will slide the mouse down 2 inches and the pointer wont budge. I tested the mouse pad I'm replacing and the mouse pointer moves fine so it's not the batteries or the wireless connection. The surface of the mouse pad must not be reflective enough. Or maybe it's the blue color?
1,Size listed is WRONG!,"Good ol' Amazon screws up again. The mouse pad is not 10.8"" x 9.5"". In fact, the pad is 8 x 9. Otherwise, this is a typical mouse pad which probably cost $.12 to make."
3,Decent Mouse pad,"if had it for a few months now and everthing is working fine, no signs of bacteria anywere !"
4,Nice but a bit small,The item arrived on time and is as described but I was a bit disappointed when I received it because it is a bit small. Next time I will go for a larger mouse pad next time - larger by an inch or two on either side.
4,Nice Scratch Album...if only that's what was focused on,"Rob Swift kills it with the hand skills, Akinyele and Prints Haze have the tightest rap track on the album with ""Holy Trinity"". My only issue with it is it's too short. 8 of the 16 tracks are just audio snippets promoting the theme of the album. I get the fact he's trying to relay his views on the Iraq War, however I would've liked to hear some more of the stuff that made him and The X-Ecutioners famous..."
4,Definitley feeling this one.,"Two tracks in particular I can not get enough of: Terror Wrist & Vietnam. Terror Wrist immediately shot to the top of my ""favorite scratch records"" list. Incredibly clean, quick and precise cutting (wouldn't expect less from these two) without trying to overwhelm you with ""look how fast I am!""."
2,text book,"There is alot of information in this book, but it does not read very easily. There just is no emotion. If you want a personal account of a few battles then this is it. Overall there is not enough to keep me interested. Though it is packed with info, it lacks any kind of depth."
1,Don't waste the money,"This 6 page summary is a complete waste, offering an over simplified summary of existing public ionformation. Data is incomplete, technical information is sorely lacking (actually non-existent), and real competitors in the sector have been missed. An item of this poor quality should not be listed at Amazon. Faulkner should be ashamed for offering it and Amazon should be ashamed for selling it."
1,Can't get the Amazon MP3 software to work,"I was really excited about this soundtrack, but still haven't been able to listen to it, since I can't get the Amazon MP3 software to work. I emailed customer support and got no answer. Too bad."
5,"Hey, Hey, Hey","Fat Albert fans can rejoice that this is still in release. It has 7 good stories from Bill Cosby's on stage comedy, 3 of which are about Fat Albert and the gang. This album came out one year after the first episode of the ground breaking cartoons series that was the brain child of Bill Cosby."
5,sweet funny memories,"I have had this LP since before I can remember (not sure how i eneded up with it) and it ALWAYS brought a smile to my face, and my parents.Its good, clean HALERIOUS fun.....buy it;)"
5,Bill is the Best,Bill Cosby usually has hillarious and especially clean material. This is no exception. It's great for both parents and children.
5,Cosby is great,Bill Cosby is the last great comedian that can make you laugh without resorting to using a lot of profanity.
2,Leaky Product,I love Nutella but these small packages turned out to be terrible. Out of the 96 small packets 21 of them were leaking all over the box. Some were perforated on the top but most of them actually had a broken seal around the edge of the foil indicating poor manufacturing. Top it off with the fact that they were all just clustered in a big box instead of in a neatly organized manner and this package was a nightmare!
5,Excellent jazz-fusion-hard rock,"Great musicianship. All instrumental. Sounds like some of Manfred Mann's Earth Band early 1970s work. Tight, fast-paced songs. Also, another 1970s band, Energy, that featured gutarist Tommy Bolin, is akin to Zeroesque. Overall, this is a fantastic CD. Keyboard/guitar work is outstanding. Bass and drums/percussion are all excellent. The band has a polished, well-rehearsed, tight sound."
2,Ooops!!!,"""Red Blooded Woman"" is not Kylie's best work. It sounds too much like something Britney would do, and has a very mediocre bridge, with those annoying ""la-la-la's. Kylie sounds like a chipmunk! ""Almost A Lover"" manages to save this single. It's the better material here."
4,A believable alternative history of World War II,"If you liked Len Deighton's detective thriller, ""SS GB"", set in Nazi-conquered England, you might enjoy ""It Happened Here."" To my way of thinking, this black-and-white film has the feel of a documentary. Its story of one person's realization of the creeping social evil in which she now lives is at once riveting and chilling."
5,"Fairly Amazing ..""What If "" Scenario in WW2 Britain..","If this was done on a shoe- string budget 39 years ago, one can only wonder what an updated version, in color, could be done nowadays. This 95 minute grainy black and white is sometimes just slightly hard to follow, probably only for a State Sider dealing with the ""Brit"" accents. Partly in documentary style, partly following a fairly naive, but good hearted nurse who finds the only way to assist her countrymen is to join the SS sponsored nursing service. Needless to say, some of her innocence is shattered. Some realistic fascist oriented discussions, funerals, reenactments of the Great War Christmas truce between the Brit and German soldiers, and some very daring battle and partisan scenes make this among the best War films ever. Shame it's not better known!"
3,Great Alternative History,"Alternative history is a very challenging exercise.Contemprorary filmmaking han easily handle it then it was when the ""It Happened Here: History of Hitler's England"" was made.This movie does not tell full background itself but it is definetly great for those who know British history well.Whoever, though, put the movie into VHS format did not ""modernize"" it--there are NO close-captions, or color. Re-creators of this movie probably could not emagine the DVD ""extras"" that tell the full background of the story."
3,Potting Bench,"The potting bench arrived over ten days beyond the delivery estimate. The assembly instructions were hand written on an index card. No picture or diagram was included. The photo of the item on Amazon is not 100% accurate. In the photo, there appears to be a cross-board in the back below the table surface. The bench I received did not have this board. The missing board probably would have given the bench greater stability."
1,This is a very Lousy Company,"Order was cancelled by them after a few months of waiting. No reason, no apology, absolutely nothing but great disapointment. Don't waste your time with this company!"
4,A look through Ginsbergs' camera. Insightful.,"This video is a rarely known about treasure for beat fans. The footage was shot by Ginsberg himself with a tender, direct and exciting tone, much like his own writing. Watch the godheads of the beat movement in apartment conversations and poetry readings."
4,It's cute,I love the Happy Bunny. It was purchased as a gift so hopefully the recipient will like it as much as I did.
5,i loved this book,this book was the best book ever!i love happy bunny and now that Jim Benton made a book i love happy bunny even more
4,GO FOR THE LONG TRACK,"I was happy to receive the four sections of 30 inch Lionel FasTrack to expand my model train options. A train only looks like a true train if at some point in the loop it pulls itself fully straight, not constantly in a turn. Adding the long sections is superior to patching together three 10 in sections, and the price is better."
4,Great album and a great performer,"I saw Robynn perform at the Fleetwood Mac show in Hartford, CT in June, 2004, just her and her guitar and she was fabulous. In fact, I wish more of the tracks on MAFG were acoustic so that you could better appreciate the skill of her playing and the beauty of her voice. I bought MAFG from her that day, and I'm glad I got it signed because she's going places. I wait anxiously for when I'll be able to hear her play live again."
4,blast from the past,"grew up listening to this and got very excited when I found it for my own kids. Not a fan of the speaking portions, but the songs are AMAZING classics that teach a good moral that will stick with you and your kids for life."
5,So glad I found these!!!,"I grew up listening to Bullfrogs and Butterflies on record. I had a baby last October and since have carried on the tradition of my family's favorite songs: Bullfrogs and Butterflies, Good Morning, and of course Patience. In fact, Patience is the only thing that can calm my son down from crying. As soon as I start singing it, he stops crying and just stares at my mouth. Eventually, a huge smile displays on his face. At first I thought it was a coincidence, until I tried it again and again. Too funny! I highly recommend these to any parent wanting to open their children's eyes to God!"
5,Love it!!!,I had the Vinyl record when I was a child and wore it out. Now that I have my own child I really wanted her to love the same music. She loves it and wants to buy more for her friends. Very pleased with the quality and the price.
3,Ahhh... brings back childhood,"This was my favorite album as a child in the 70s. It is still a good one, though a little dated (obviously). I was impressed with the quality of the recording and also the songs are very ""sing-a-long-able"" if that makes sense. Overall, a good one. My child is only six weeks old so I can't say whether he will like it yet!"
4,Used this with my desktop,"Couldn't simply plug the hub straight into one of my desktop's USB ports to use it that way as the keyboard would function off of it but my mouse would not. However, it comes with an optional power adapter which helps it function perfectly. Its compact, unobtrusive size combined with the ability to use four additional peripherals makes it A-1 in my book. Would definitely buy another one, if needed.Gail StrumbergerAuthor, ""Shock Therapy: Planaphobic""Shock Therapy: Planaphobic (At Last! Writing a Business Plan for Your Haunted House or Halloween Event Is Less Painful Than a Lobotomy)"
2,dry...very dry,"Although the book covers the basics needed for effective career counseling, the authors need to work on spicing up the format and presentation of the material. The topics were difficult to read at times because the material just seemed to drag."
3,stunning camera work & fascinating history,"a strange hybrid of documentary and travelog and potboiler docudrama; its clear that genres were still defining themselves when this movie was made. while much of the ""plotline"" is dubious, the heroism of the figures involved is not, and the camera work under undeniably terrifying conditions is nothing short of spectacular. i wont call this a great movie but id recommend it to anyone."
3,Work OK,These are as advertised. But you have to leave a wide border all the way around because it will come loose.
2,Ok but no for Medicare Card,"Didn't work on my SS card, fell apart in a week? Had to tape up Medicare card in Doc's office when it fell apart."
4,Easiest way to laminate small paper products,I bought it to laminate my Medicare card worked well. I plan on using it for some photos I want to carry in my wallet as well.
4,Larger than listed,Item PL903G is actually 2 15/16 X 3 15/16 so I was able to laminate a card overlapping the plastic for better sealing then trim it to fit my wallet. Was able to buy locally (W) for just under $2.
4,great read...makes me want to go to Africa,"I saw Ross on Nat Geo's ""Locked Up Abroad"" and the story of his safari group's abduction peaked further interest. Upon reading Ross' book I learned a great deal more about Africa's wildlife and people."
1,Tiresome Tripe,"Definitely not worth its price. I kept waiting for the book to start, to inform me, to entertain me, to even tell me something which I already knew in a fresh manner or from an engaging perspective. I came away thoroughly disappointed. I would return the book in a flash if I could muster the energy.Those interested in this genre would be much better served by anything written by Peter Hathaway Capstick or even the more recent ruminations of Philip Caputo in ""Ghosts of Tsavo"".This book is not beautiful; it is silly and self-pitying."
5,Sawa Sawa,"On January 20th, 2003 a 10 ton elephant gave chase to our Range Rover in Samburu National Park. In the days that followed I photographed rhino as I lay motionless in the grass 10 feet from the endangered animals, witnessed the birth of 3 wildebeest and the death, the same day, of 7 calves who dared venture too close to a pride of Lions in the Serengeti. Mark Ross,the author of Dangerous Beauty, was our guide, and it is hard to imagine a person more knowledgeable and passionate about the flora and fauna of Eastern Africa than him. While the book documents the depths to which man can sink, it is also a testimony to a continent and a people in grave danger from AIDS, poverty, poaching and war. Marks love of the people and wildlife of East Africa is apparent on every page."
4,Great stories from Africa,"Dangerous Beauty is a great storybook. Mark C. Ross shares his incredible life stories in this book, and their fascinating. The way he encounters the same animals again and again and creates special bonds with them, even babysitting their children, to me is amazing. The book is impossible to put down because there is a new story with every five pages or so. The book leaves you breathless, wanting more. It's an awesome book, read it!"
2,Wasn't what I was looking for,"OK, I only watched 4 of the 15 chapters, so this review is probably not the final answer. You will like this serial if you enjoy watching indians attack white people in wagons. Endless scenes of indians chasing wagons, horses running and guns shooting. Wagons crashing and burning, over and over and over. Sorry, but I had to turn it off. Here we have the standard story line of white men posing as indians, making the indians look bad. I really wanted to like this serial, but the truth prevailed--not all serials are good (or worth watching)."
2,Another of Universal's sloppy serial production,"Universal serials, especially westerns, have the same vices and virtues; a good cast and good concept. The delivery is noisy soundtracks, sloppy film editing, 40% stock footage, repitition os such footage, and poor contunuity. The title music is the same as in Winners of the West, and is very memorable, but wasted by the above mentioed production flaws. Serial fans are very tolerate and are not expecting Hamlet, but this is a sound and a fury signifying nothing."
2,I'm not good at bad reviews,"I feel like I should apologize to the spirit of Lon Chaney, Jr., but hey, he just comes out so completely wooden as the hero in this run of the mill western serial. The pacing seems pedestrian, and I'm sorry, but the only way I can recommend it is for dyed-in-the-wool Chaney, Jr. collectors and for those who are interested in Noah Beery Sr. & Jr. Noah Beery Sr. is a passable bad guy and his son is a good enough comic sidekick. However, if you're building up a collection of western serials, I recommend the Red Ryder and Zorro serials along with some of the classic cowboy actors such as Johnny Mack Brown before purchasing this one."
5,Gloves,Came on time. Works wonderfully. Even used them to make some hand balloons. Keeps kids hands clean when doing arts and crafts stuff
5,Eydie Gorme is attractive with a genre of screen music.,"Her song is very wonderful in not only Latin music but also other fields.She sings ""The Days Of Wine and Roses"" not to betray my expectation.Besides, ""As Time Goes By"",""The Way We Were"",""Secret Love"",""A Time For Us"",""It Was A Good Time"" are very good, too."
2,Mildly entertaining,"You'd expect some type of hard evidence after all this time. No photos are given of vast underground tunnels (some were allegedly under the WTC in NY) that exist in many places throughout the world. With seismic equipment they would be simple to find. No photos of aliens or alien hybrids, etc, etc.No pieces of advanced alien hardware, no funny footprints, no medical documents that would reveal the aliens in human shape were really aliens. There's really nothing but a few people claiming weird things.David Icke combs through thousands of years of human history to try to prove his point that the aliens have been controlling us for years. The trouble is if you can gather bits and pieces of anything throughout human history to prove just about any theory.His case just isn't strong enough. I wouldn't reccomend buying it. I read most of it in a few hours in the bookstore."
3,"Maybe, Maybe not","If Mr. Icke believes that the world is controled via a small cabal of reptiles why was this book alowed to see the light of day in the first place??? Why didn't these beings get a hold of the manuscript (since they control everything, access to the publisher should have been no problem) and hunt the author down??? Or better yet have him die in some freak accident???I believe we are controled, but not by reptiles. ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX and CNN, control almost all of the media outlets, i.e. newspapers, radio stations, TV and all of the major ISPs. I have yet to see a news station do an entire broadcast with no human intrest stories at all. News devotes little or no in depth coverage of goverment or business scams and instead focuses on the major car accident on RT 45 that cloged up the drive home or the major storm that is headed our way."
4,children of the matrix,"I ordered several used books,as we were having a book review, the price was excellent, it was a shame the shipping cost so much.The books were delivered in a timely manner, and came in excellent shape, I would order again from this vendor"
3,Dungeons & Dragons Conspiracy.,"Persecutory Delusional people, like people who are stoned or very drunk, tend to write the most imaginitive works of science fiction & fantasy, but it wasn't entirely original.It reminded me highly of chapter 3 of the Neverwinter Nights video game that came out a year after this book was first published. NWN uses the Lizardfolk's smarter ancestors from Dungeons & Dragons, which is older than this book, but instead of having Bipedal Sarruks out in the open enslaving humans as an inferior race in medieval times, it has them hiding amongst us, pulling the strings from behind costumes in various time settings.So I guess if you really enjoyed this book, you should try playing Neverwinter Nights too."
1,90 % useful information - 10 % schitzoid paranoid denial,"Too bad David Icke has not grown out of seeing boogie men in dark closets. Other than his paranoia about repitilian space aliens controlling everything he is quite valid (metaphorically). He makes a nice subject for review though. He is a great example of what happen to all of us in the dark corners of our own repitilian consciousness. If you want to read a more precise and compelling view of what this is all about then read anything by Ken Wilber. Expecially Up from Eden where he anthopologically disects human consciousness and ""its"" tendancies to fantasize in themes that match our evolution. Much like David Icke is doing now and like our ancesters did when they wrote the metaphorical stories that have become fertile ground for Mr. Ickes imagination."
3,Funny!!,"Trust no one! May be he's one of lizard army from another dimension. Your government, your king or even your religion leader are part of them. That's main idea of this book. Warning!By admiting this theory may change your life to be a jerk amongst your friend. But who knows? Everything may be possible. Anyway, please report me asap if you find someone transform himself to a lizard :)"
4,AMAZING!!,"I was so amazed to find a book that validated every ""TRUTH"" that I had held in mind for such a long, long time... unlike David, however I went to school, passed all my tests and went to University... my biggest gripe about the book... Children of the Matrix, were the typos... I wondered how so many typos had gotten past his editor? I must admit, before finding this book I was beginning to think myself terribly paranoid, as the majority of my acquaintences and friends do not subscribe to my extremist conspiracy theories... but this was exactly the validation I needed!! This book most definately will change how I conduct and live my life! I do have to admit that while some of the information was a little hard for even me to swallow... I cannot discount it... I have not been able to put this book down since I've gotten it... and I read excerpts to my husband and friends every chance I get! Perhaps ignorance is bliss... but Knowledge is power!"
5,This is absolutely amazing stuff,"Funnily, while other contributors appear to have problems accepting the reptilian connection in Icke's expositions, I find them very easy indeed to believe. Perhaps its my African culture which has long recognised the existence of these other realms and dimensions. But I don't at all find it hard to believe that ONLY NON-HUMANS - demons to be precise - are morally capable of unleashing the enormous, vapid cruelty that has for so long characterised our existence on earth, from the orcestrated wars which kill and maim millions, to the immensely odious, indeed, satanic economic policies of banking, 'globalisation', debt, monstrous military arsenals and horrendous, manufactured diseases such as AIDS. Truly, could a few REAL HUMANS on their own ever have conceived and devised such a global compendium of misery and death for the sole purpose of thwarting their own kind? That's what I find impossible to believe."
1,Not as funny as you may think,"Ok, the idiot theory that Zionists engineered the Holocaust solely to oppress Arabs has been bandied about Nazi circles for years, but the one about them being pawns of the lizard kings is kind of funny.Sadly it doesn't really stay funny and the anti-semitic rantings of a man that should have been taking anti-depressants rather than LSD needs pity not encouragement."
3,Martin Simpson in Concert,"Martin Simpson is a fantastic guitar player and I like most of the songs he did, but he talked more than I would have liked and it was a little slow"
5,FINALLY PLUS SIZE RINGS,"I AM SO GLAD SOMEONE FINALLY STARTED OFFERING WOMEN'S RINGS IS PLUS SIZES, LIKE 11, 12, 13, ETC.THE ONLY LARGE SIZES OFFERED IN THE PAST WERE MENS AND THEY WERE BIG AND BULKY - NICE QUALITY TOO!"
2,"Looks nice, but doesn't hold up well","I recieved this ring as a birthday present several months ago. After only seven months of regular wear, the ring developed a crack in one of the two bands. This eventually wore through and now there is a break several millimeters wide with a sharp edge that digs into my finger. Quality jewelry should NOT break under normal stress."
1,Don't buy Sony TV's....There are plenty good brands out there instead,"Bought the Sony projection TV 3 years ago and low and behold...it has the"" blue streak on bottom of my SONY TV MODEL KDF-E42A10"" issue documents all over google, etc.No excuses for inferior products and lack of support to resolve. Samsung makes a GREAT lcd tv that I will buy instead. If you don't care about wasting money ( e.g. work for a US government agency) then buy this TV....."
5,manual,"The manual for this product is the same one you can find at amazon under kdfe50a10, the 50"" model"
1,"GREAT TV, BUT BROKE AFTER 2 YEARS","NOT RELIABLE SONY PRODUCT AND HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, PLEASE STAY AWAY AND SAVE YOURSELF A HEADACHE!"
2,Not working right out of the box !,"I picked one at Best Buy yesterday after waiting 4 days for it to come in. I plugged the projection TV and press power button. I saw the initial setup on the screen momentarily, then a clicking sound and then it shut down. Then the red light blinks 4 times repeatedly. I tried again several times, unplugging the tv completely, doing the factory reset as mentioned in the manual but still the same. I will return this TV today and get a new one, it's too much of a hassle. I was dissapointed this happened to me after finally deciding to get this TV based on excellent reviews. I am now worried and doubtful if this TV will last for a long time after getting a DOA right out of the box. The TV was manufactured DEC. 2005 printed at the back."
1,SONY LCD REA PROJECTION TELEVISIONS,"I purchased my tv in Dec 2004. I did not purchase the extended warranty. These sets are have all kinds of video problems. Myself and other LCD owners have called for in home service. The service company is QUALXSERV in home service. They want $350.00 to come to your home if you do not have the extended warranty, and can not guarantee a fix. Take it from me buy some other Brand"
4,Very Good TV,"I'm very happy with the set. Although not listed in the specs, it must have a QAM tuner, because I am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all I have is basic cable. I was thrilled when I made this discovery. Watching football games in HD, without paying for digital cable, almost made me weep with happiness.The picture quality for analog channels is only so-so. I really wish the remote was illuminated. Also, Amazon took much longer to deliver the TV than was promised. Other than these negatives, I'm very happy."
2,Optical Assembly,"I agree with all the reveiws that this TV produces an excellent picture; when it works right. We purchased a Sony KDF42WE65, this is not the same as the KDFE42A10. However the repair shop said that all Sony rear projection LCD's use the same optical assembly. Our optical assembly went bad after 13 months. After over $1,100 in parts/repairs, it still does not produce a balanced color picture. Sony makes excellent products but no longer should get a ""free pass"" on quality. Evaluate other manufactures and consider purchasing an extended warranty. LCD rear projection technology produces a wonderful display, but is still a relatively new."
1,STAY AWAY,"Stay away from this Sony piece of junk. Mine started to develope blotchy patches in the middle of the picture. Started to do research on the web and found web site dedicated to this. It seems the light engines fail in many of the Sony WEGA and GrandWEGA TV's after a few years. There are several class action lawsuits against Sony because the light engines are defective, and these law suite claim Sony may have even known about the problem and continued to sell the TV's at retail outlets. Sad thing is, when I got the TV the picture was really outstanding. But after just four years I'm in the market for a new TV."
4,good TV at good price,It was a good experience to purchase this big item on-line. Only thing could be improved is its order tracking. The tracking system of the third party delivery company was not updated very often like UPS or Fedex.
5,"Not a review, but an important question!",How long will the bulb last? And does 3 or 4 bulb replacements (about $300 each) in about 10 years justify buying this TV??
4,Lengthy search results in satisfied customer.,"I am very happy with the selection I made for the Sony 42"" LCD TV. The picture quality is excellent. Since my husband and I are senior citizens, the weight and size of the television was a major factor in the purchase, and we were very happy with our ability to install it. Operation of the TV is easy enough; my husband was able to read and understand the manual without much frustration or complication and was able to easily teach me. The high definition was a factor in our purchase, but we honestly can't see any difference in the HD channels picture quality. We were a little concerned with the delivery process, but it arrived in a timely manner and was delivered by courteous professionals. In researching all the various televisions on the market, this one best fit our needs and we are totally satisfied with our purchase."
1,does not last no tech support,"Purchased about 2 and a half years ago, and got the common problem of multi color verticle lines across the display. Online research points to the B block as being the problem ($400.00 non returnable part), but sony technical support will not confirm it has fixed other peoples tvs. Sony did confirm other people have had this same problem with this tv, but they would not tell me how they fixed it unless I called the 1-900 phone number to be charged 3.50 a minute. The TV does not last and sony will charge at a minimum 400.00 dollars to fix it. Do not make the same mistake I did, do not buy this TV."
4,Lets Cha-Cha !!!,I purchased this cd for my mother because she works at a senior citizens center.They have a version of the cha-cha slide there. My mom loves the cd. She uses the cd as a form of exercise. My children also love dancing to it with my mom. I would recommend this cd for a family gathering or event or just to have in your collection of cds to pull out from time to time to have fun and get a little exercise.
5,Super Fast,Hey thanks for sending the CD as fast as you did. Awesome service. CD is great condition. I have found my new place to shop!
2,Not Very Good,The CD ws difficult to play. We could only get 1 song to play for us - that is three different people could not get their entire CD to play.
1,junk,"I recently bought two sets of these from two different company's. Both sets are junk and are going back.The quality of these are not the Brown and Sharpe of the past. The advertised (Parallel within +/-0.0002"" - paired +/-0.0002"") is not true. The 1.5"" pair has deburred edges that has been done with what looks like a deburring buffing wheel. This has left the locating surfaces with rounded over edges. Also the the height difference betweenthe two is .020""(this is not a typo) and not +/- .0002"". I can by cheap China made stuff that is a lot better.Do not waste your money."
3,Not a bad show...,"Haven't seen any other ""Killer"" video's but I think I'd like to buy another one before I can compare this one. He seems, I don't know, not very happy in this concert. Just my opinion. I don't think he realizes the talent that's on stage with him that's for sure."
3,Ya Wanna See An Old Man?,"If you do, then get this video. It shows an OLD Jerry Lee Lewis struggling to play well, but he doesn't look like he's having a good time at all. He looks upset, miserable, and old. As for the music, it's pretty good if you edit out the slow songs. Otherwise, it's an old man trying to play. Get something else."
1,So what is it?,"There is no description for this magazine. Before now, I couldn't say that I had heard of it. Now, after clicking on the link and seeing there was no description... I can safely say that I STILL have not heard of it. So what is it?"
1,Poor quality,I was not happy with the product. I feel that it was cheaply made for the price they charged. It is made of cheap vnyl with velcrose snaps which with over time will not stick like velcrose does with time. I would never buy anything like that again.
1,Decent but deceptive.,"The pentacle pendant I received was ""decent"" but not nearly as nice as the one pictured. I wanted something simple but beautiful, what I got was a let down. The angles are off and the proportions are uneven, making the design actually look like a mistake. I can't just turn it over because the circle is bowed out too much between two points and the back is also uneven.I decided to keep it because its my very first pentacle and I'm not perfect either. As I transform, I know the perfect one for me will come to me in time.That said, I would not recommend this product. It's price plus what you pay in shipping make it a rip off."
1,Awful!,The item I received is NOT the same as pictured. It looks and feel like plastic. I'm pretty sure it will fade because (and I'm not kidding) it reads 924 instead of 925!!! I almost can't believe it. I'm very dissapointed.
5,Pendant,"Get real how much can u say about a neckalace, It's a very fine quality silver, good thickness,& looks great on me. The Bear"
4,Wonderful text of presidential history/analysis,"Milkis and Nelson do a great job of covering two centuries of presidential history. The history is concise but intriguing and the analysis is enlightening. Particular emphasis is placed on the ""Great"" presidencies of Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, and FDR.An additional note: Milkis is a terrific professor at the University of Virginia. His lectures are fun and engaging - a tremendous scholar and interesting person."
3,You'll have to work your way through this one,"This is one of those books that you think you'll never finish, but you can't stop reading it because it hints at enough to make you want to see what's around the bend. Some parts of it are so convoluted and twisted that you have to keep reading to make sure you understand what is going on. Yes, the book contains mother-daughter incest, but it's presented in a way that you find it more pathetic or sad than disgusting. It finally turns into a lesbian novel, but not until the end. I'm not sure I liked Landy, the main character. She's certainly one of the most complex individuals I've encountered in a book in a while. I'm not sure I liked the book either, though I didn't hate it. I would say that you have to read the book and decide for yourself. It still has me thinking."
1,Give me a break...,"Coming from an abusive household myself, and suffering ALOT worse than this ""author"", she sounds like a whiney liberal who took a few slaps as a child and made up the rest. So what if her mother was crazy, lots of mothers are if not worse. You might find this entertaining if you keep in mind that this is all just fantasy."
4,A quite enjoyable '30's serial,"In the 30's, there was something thrilling about stunt flying, dogfights in the air, and the like. This 12 chapter serial captures all that with some notable B movie actors. Tom Steele was prominent in westerns especially, as was Gunn ""Big Boy"" Williams who plays his sidekick. J. Carrol Naish is prominent as one of the several very suspicious characters who could well be the principle bad guy.There's lots of good aerial footage here featuring the old bi-planes, along with a lot of stunt footage. As far as spotting the villain, well, that's fairly easy in a Mascot serial, but it's still lots of fun. These were made to see one weekly chapter at a time, and if you can limit yourself to a chapter a day, you will get more of the olden day enjoyment out of this and any serial."
2,New dispenser lid needed,"I have tried all types of bands of wipes that come in these canisters. While the product is a good one the dispenser lid is a chore to get to work. The wipes jam in the top or shred, or you get a quarter size piece of the wipe. The makers really need to look into a new way to dispense the product."
2,"Great product, rediculous price though here on amazon","this is a fantastic product but you can find it at your local target or walmart store for $4.00 for the 80-count of wipes...unless it comes with more then one of the containers of wipes and just doesn't mention it in the product description its definitely an outrageous price, which is unusual for amazon they are usually the cheapest on everything."
2,Since I Fell for You,"The album shows off Eydie's great voice, however I found the entire work oppressive at times. Would prefer more ""up tempo""."
1,I have a REASON for only giving a One Star Rating,"My reason for the one star rating is NOT that these are lousy books!! I think these are WONDERFUL books. The stories are interesting, imaginative, moral, fun, and every other good thing for kids to hear. I had them read to me as a child, and have re-read them on my own into my adult life.My complaint against this particular book (and the other two published in 2000: Tales of the Resistance, & Tales of the Restoration) is the ILLUSTRATIONS, which are poor at best. The original printing in 1983 had enchanting illustrations that were as rich and clever as the stories themselves. I would advise that you DO NOT BUY the 2000 publication of these books. Rather, try to find one of the hardbacks published in 1983.I hate to be negative because THESE ARE AMAZING BOOKS, but as an artist, I feel strongly about the illustrations. Thank you for reading."
5,Exquisite!,"After searching for years for a copy of this book, I finally found one in a local outlet bookstore. I was absolutely thrilled. I own the other two books in the Kingdom Tales Series, and couldn't leave the collection incomplete. These stories are wonderful for lovers of fairy tales and moral tales alike. While the basis for the series is Scriptural, the books themselves have an appeal that overreaches religious barriers. I would definitely reccommend this series to anyone with children or who loves fantasy. Particularly nice about Resistance are the stories of everyday people becoming extraordinary, and the art of Jack Stockton -- breathtaking."
4,Beach Reading,"David Robbins writes a fun read. It is certainly not ""heavy"" sci/fi. This series is most closely linked in writing style, plot... to the James Axler ""Deathlands"" and ""Outlanders"". Mr. Robbins, however, does not appear to be a nom' de plume for a group of writers. Read it on the beach with a beer, read it on a flight but don't read it to expand your intellect. A short (255 page), enjoyable bit of throwaway fiction."
4,Good Continuation of the Series,"I enjoyed this book and I am continuing on to read the next book in the series. It is the continuation of Blade and his Alpha Triad's journey after their last attempt to reach the Twin Cities was cut short in The Fox Run. This book takes the three members of Alpha Triad and begins to give them their own personalities and fighting abilities. They no longer are just Alpha Triad, but now they are truly Blade, Hickok and Geronimo. Joshua even comes into his own in this book. The Triad heads off to Minneapolis/St. Paul where they meet multiple friendlies and unfriendlies."
4,Enjoyable hour with a relaxed Cash,He obviously feels comfortable in the church setting and puts on an enjoyable show - June Carter shines in this one. Although it lacks the edge of a prison show - Johnny is not dogging it and having a good time and seems quite happy. Worth the price of admission.
4,Another good DVD by Johnny Cash but with reservations.,"Johnny Cash sounds great in this video although I didn't think the sound quality was that good. The sound had too much mid range but that can be corrected by an equalizer. I also thought that the guitar player did a good job of filling in for Bob Wooten, but I agree with another reviewer who wrote that the guitar player on this concert seemed to be in his own world...playing with his back to the people, which was annoying. He apparently didn't think he was on camera or would be in a video. I still thought this was a great concert however and would recommend this to any Johnny cash fan."
4,The mathematical theory of p- and hp-FEMs,"The number of books on high order p- and hp-finite element methods is limited. This book goes one step further by providing a rigorous mathematical treatement of these methods applied to linear elliptic boundary value problems. It includes very recent advances in the field and it is an excellent resource for both researchers and educators. The only negative aspect of this first edition of the book is the (unusually high number of) typographical errors. Hopefully, this will be corrected in the second edition."
4,"Wonderful serial adventure, brought back great memories","If you are a serial lover as I am this was just wonderful, well done, clear video and sound. Brought back great memories of my childhood as I waited for each new episode, just wonderful."
1,UGH!,"Seriousy?! I would love to know what book the other reviewers were reading because I am having an extremely difficult time getting through this book. Mia comes across as a desperate heroine with no pride as she literally chases after Shanghai begging him to love her. Shanghai comes across as a whiney jerk with a huge chip on his shoulder, holding an irrational grudge against Mia. The dialogue is awful, the plot is a bit ridiculous, and the supporting characters are boring. I also have a difficult time with romance novels where the hero and heroine don't connect until a third of the way through the book (after the prologue, they don't come together again until almost half way through the book). I actually haven't finished the book yet, but needed to add this review before anyone else fell for the idiots who gave this trash 4 or 5 stars (WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!). I should have known better than to pick a book where the hero's name is Shanghai."
1,SORRY CHRIS,"Chris Connor was to me the greatest female jazz vocalist in my lifetime. 'As Time Goes By' was a big disapointment. The uptempo tunes had no sense of excitement. I felt like the artists were just going through the motion. The ballads were excruciatingly slow with no help from the trio. If ever a song was written to swing, it is 'Gone With The Wind'. The unbelievably slow tempo of this song in this CD almost put me to sleep. Sorry Chris, this is a dust collector."
5,Made my 2001 Mustang Cobra ROAR,The HP increased about 12 and the torque set me back in the seat. Very happy with the performance increase thanks Hypertech.
4,Very good serial and from a nice print too!,"I've never been a big fan of the Mascot serials but this one is a good one! Tom Mix is past his prime but still fun to watch (along with his horse Tony of course!). Fine supporting cast headed by Joan Gale as the Indian heroine, Charles Middleton (the perfect villain for any serial!), Robert Frazer, Niles Welch and Jason Robards, Sr. 15 action packed chapters on 2 discs plus some bonus serial trailers. VCI's source material appears to be a fine grain 16mm print and it's very good. Highly recommended for serial or western fans!"
3,Tom Mix Rides Into the Movie Sunset,"One of Mascot's last serials before merging with Republic Pictures, ""The Miracle Rider"" (1935) is best known as Tom Mix's screen farewell. The cowboy legend plays a Texas Ranger in this creaky yet entertaining sci-fi Western - with 15 chapters of hard-riding action and memorable villainy from Charles Middleton. No match for Mix's silent classics, but good fun. VCI's two-disc set remains superior to the numerous public domain offerings."
5,straight shooters always win,"Early westerns attracted some very interesting people. The son of Jesse James became a serial star. Bank robber Al Jennings became a director. Lawman Bill Tilghman became a director. Bank robber Emmett Dalton became a technical advisor. Wyatt Earp became a technical advisor. And (are you ready for this?) months after he had been reported killed in a shootout in Bolivia, Butch Cassidy was discovered living in Oregon writing a screenplay!But audiences didn't respond to their efforts, they wanted to see showman Tom Mix and his super-horse, Tony, up on the screen. There was just no one like Tom Mix. Dressed up in a purple suit, silver-buckled high-heeled cowboy boots, and a high-crowned white Stetson, he stopped traffic everywhere he appeared."
4,Good for wanderers/explorers... but a little outdated.,"I can only think of two complaints for the average Joe. The first is that the M50 is *far* more complete than the map let shows - missed my exit coming across the south because I was (foolishly on my part) waiting for the M50 to change down to a normal roadway... oops. The second was the lack of Irish names for the cities. Especially if you like to get out in the country - you might not know that ""Droichead - Atha"" and ""Drogheda"" are the same thing. I've studied a tiny bit of Gaelic, so it wasn't too bad for me, but keep that in mind if you are an explorer.Other than that, it took plenty of normal roadtrip map abuse, helping us see the real sites of Ireland and have an absolutely amazing trip.Tip: you might just take a Irish-<yourLanguage> dictionary with you on the trip if you are interested in really exploring more.I can't wait for my next visit..."
2,"Great guys, but heinous music!","The guys are great looking (especially Chris Young and Matt Anders), but there's music being played over their voices, so you never get to hear the guys talk. The camera work isn't the best (the close-ups are somewhat out of focus), but the selection of good looking guys was decent enough to warrant two stars. This is softcore stuff, which is fine if you don't play music over the models' voices and know how to focus in for close-ups!"
1,Egalitarian Fantasy,"This book certainly doesn't live up to its title, and is propelled mostly by the author's egalitarian fantasies, rather than the objective science presented in the Bell Curve."
2,NOT a History of the Japanese Military,"The first quarter of the book deals with European military actions in China with the occasional mention of the Japanese.The next half of the book deals with the Russo-Japanese War,almost entirely from the Russian perspective. He skims overthe period between the world wars and finally brushes overWorld War II.It has a number of extraordinarily glaring factual errors and itis telling that his bibliography includes exactly ONE Japaneselanguage source...."
5,"Interesting, informative and easy to read.","I am a collector and student of the Russo/Japanese War. This is the first book, of many, that I could read that was unbiased and actually fun to read. I don't know what the problem the other people who read this book have. It seems like they have some kind of grand agenda or ? Maybe they should try writing, but then again maybe they have...Anyway, I think this is a great book!"
3,Good book like we expect from o'reilly but not titled right.,"I liked this book a lot, most books from o'reilly are superb. It it falls into my one pet peeves, along with the 90 percent of digital photography books. It puts all the emphasis on the digital and very little on the photography. This book will not help you take better pictures with your digital camera, it will help fix and process pictures in photoshop and other program, so really it should be called expert techniques in digital photo processing. That being said, it has some great chapters on digital workflow, photoshop and 3rd party photoshop plugins, as well as retouching techniques. All of these go more in depth then what you find in most photoshop books alone."
5,Excellent for the Photoshop/Digital beginner,Easy to follow and easy to use for the novice photoshop/digital photographer/editor.
2,Poor quality photographs mar book that otherwise might be useful,Is this guy really a pro? I found many of the photographs in this book to be poorly composed or just generally a boring photo. The suggested alterations seems to just be for the point of demonstrating what you can do. Is the author really that short on good photographs that he wants to recompose or enhance?I wish I had seen this book in the store before putting it on my wish list. I would suggest looking elsewhere for a book with better examples.
2,"Not thorough, lacking step-by-step instruction.","I have attempted to learn from this book several times but I constantly find it lacks thorough step-by-step instructions. It reminds me of a set of instructions that have been hastily written. Steps are omitted time and time again. I consistently find myself referring back to other books on Photoshop like Adobe Photoshop CS one-on-one. I think the author has a vast amount of knowledge and much to offer but this book needs to be rewritten. If you're looking for knowledge on how to use Photoshop advance techniques, this book provides only glimpses of how to actually apply advanced techniques."
5,"Great Gift, Very bright...","A lot of Laser pointers you find for under $20 are dim and weak. With this one you get what you pay for. It's very bright and works extremely well. I never had any problems with mine, it was quite reliable. They also make good gifts for anyone who likes gadgets/lasers and the like. Or for teachers/instructors. (They dig these kinds of things)."
1,I AGREE,"I agree with the reviewer that said it was terrible. This is their worst release ever. It kind of broke my heart. I was hoping for another classic with songs like ""In the Red"" ""Work or War"" and ""The Kids Will Revolt"" but no!!! This is horrible. Get any other release but this one.TRASH"
3,"Ok, but absolutely their worst.","What the hell has happened to AGT? Why, oh, why does this album sound watered down? There was once a day when I blasted ""Religion is a Scam"" in my car so loud it hurt. I hoped upon hope that AGT would deliver and give me yet another reason to believe that they are the best band in the scene. Sadly, I have been let down. It lacks the energy of previous albums for obvious reasons. Perhaps they will regain my trust with the next recording. I must believe so, or I would instantly break into tears. Please, AGT, please reclaim your throne in the court of street punk."
5,Traditional Chinese Medicine and Aromatherapy,"Mr. Mojay does a wonderful job making aromatherapy applicable to Traditional Chinese Medicine. While most people understand that aromatherapy can influence the emotions, most books I have encountered are fairly general about how they affect emotions. Lavender, for example, is ""calming""--but so is sandalwood, geranium, chamomile, and any number of other oils. Using the theories of Traditional Chinese Medicine (the same theories that are the basis of acupuncture), you can target an essence more specifically for your body. That he does all this in an easy to read book is so much the better!"
5,Gem of a book,"This is one of those rare books that surpassed my expectations. This is not your typical aromatherapy book and this book contains practically no recipes (it has just a few). What you'll find in this book is about 40 of the most-popular aromatherapy essential oils brought to life. The author does this successfully by looking at the essential oils from the perspective of the Chinese five-elements, and by juxtaposing the essential oils with archetypes from mythology, religion and astrology, helping you to experience the ""personality"" of each essential oil.The author goes over some common psychological and emotional issues that people experience and suggests which essential oils may be most suitable. The book also contains a couple of illustrated pages related to applying massage and accupressure."
4,something different about essential oils,"There are three main sections in this book. The first gives an overview of Traditional Medicine principles. The second part gives a detailed description of the most common essential oils and their effects, not like any aromatherapy book because it incorporates the Chinese Medicine principles as heating, warming, cooling, yin and yang...There is an indication on how to use the oils on some major Chinese acupuncture points.The third part deals with some ailments related to the mind ill healthIt is a very different book indeed, and as an Aromatherapist working with cases of stress and anxiety , I am very glad to have added it to my bookshelf.I already knew that the same oil work differently on different people, now I know why!Thanks for Amazon,their fast delivery and their huge choice"
4,Good Book,"I'm not sure this book is quite what I need. I am looking for recipes. This is nice for a brief overview of aromatherapy, but not quite detailed enough."
3,Variously interesting,"A variety of articles of criticism show up here, of various length and dryness, but most are rather interseting, drawing on ancient mythology or even biblical mythology to prove a point. Some articles are easier to get than others, depending on what the reader has read. Anyone who's read Neuromancer by William Gibson might want to take a peek."
4,X - Ray,"This book is amazing. The subjects used are surreal. The effect Nars gives is futuristic and sexy. His portraits are spectacular. At first glance, the collection may seem overwhelming, but concentrating on each picture made the book very enjoyable to look at. I recommend this to any collection of photography books."
5,Core strength challange,"This gadget works legs, abs and core to keep you strong and challenge your ability to keep the wheel straight."
4,"Different, but good.","I took a chance in purchasing the Power Wheel II and it ended-up working out nicely. It is very sturdy and well-built piece of equipment and it gets me away from the standard, boring core workouts that I've done for years. The dvd that comes with it could have been a little more detailed and maybe even included a structured workout, which would have earned it a five-star rating."
3,Overpriced product,"First, it's not that high quality as it claimed. I broke my pedal in 2 weeks. Ok, it can still be used as normal power wheel.Second, it's not stable at all. I'm not sure if it's designed to be instable for training pupose. But obviously, it's not a good choice for beginer.At last, the price is too high. For me, it's like I paid 4-5 time price to get what it supposed to do."
3,A little disappointed,"The product is sturdy but I found that my toes drug on the ground. Additionally, like previous comments, I wish there had been a workout video with the system.Have mixed feelings about the satisfaction of my purchase and doubts if I would do it again knowing what I know now."
5,Great design,"This really works. It isolates and exercises all the abdominal muscles. The DVD that comes along with the product was very helpful. The product itself is easy to assemble and is made from superior quality construction materials. I recommend this product for anyone who wants to tone up their abs.There are a variety of exercises designed for beginners and advanced users. Although the product is a bit overpriced, its robust design ensures it lasts for a lifetime."
4,good,"over all this is a good product. i have a small room in my house to workout in and this fits well. you get to have more options than you would with just a reg ab roller. the only thing that i don't like about it is the straps for your feet need to be a little longer. im not a big guy onlky about 6' tall and i have trouble getting the straps to go over my feet. also once you get your feet strapped in the back straps don't like to stay on, and it is awkward rolling onto your belly to use the feet. other wise the workouts are great"
5,Great,This item is great! Very easy to put together and use. It really works your all muscles. In half the time that you would spend at the gym.
4,Lifeline USA Power Wheel II,"I like how the Power Wheel II operates, but it takes time to get in and out of. It is a good workout tool."
5,Fisico y Empresario,"Esta es la edicion en espanol de Scientific American, bueno no hay mas que decir, es la mejor publicacion de divulgacion cientifica."
1,WARNING !,"This is NOT the 'horror' version. This is the PG 'children's fantasy adventure' version.MYA really should make this clear on the cover and NOT list it's alternate titles (with added gore; Screamers, Island of the Mutations, Something Waits in the Dark).This has none of the gore inserts and is ninety-nine minutes of pure tedium, unless you want to see a film that's like 'Warlords of Atlantis' but with lower production values and all the action sucked out of it. And no Doug McLure."
1,What A Waste Of Time,"Don't bother with this disc, it's poor quality and when I tried playing it via my dvd boosted to 1080 on my LCD-TV, the picture quality was more atrocious than the movie. To make matters worse I thought or was at least hoping this was or would have Screamers in there somewhere. Please would some good quality company release Screamers as Island Of The Fishmen plays out like a Disney film gone wrong."
5,comfy socks,"I love Thorlo socks and own several different styles for different activities. My feet, especially the heels, are very narrow, and the cushioning really does help prevent blisters. This fitness style is light and comfortable for exercising."
3,Keep looking,It was ok.. would have been better with a zipped compartment. I should have kept looking.
1,Too big.,I wanted something just big enough to hold my passport and maybe a credit card without putting them in my bag. This thing is huge and there is nothing subtle about wearing it under clothes.
3,"Good, but not great","I'm satisfied enough with this purchase that I don't outright regret it. I wish it had more pockets and a longer strap. I thought that since this was a travel wallet, it would have more compartments. It's very basic, and the fabric is a little on the thin side. I purchased this for use when I'm traveling in harsh enough climates that I can't carry a regular purse, so I wanted this to act as the mini security purse around my neck so that I could keep tabs on my money, passport, cellphone, etc. This will do that, but again, because it's very basic with no compartments, I'll have loose change and trinkets jangling around in there, and because the fabric and strap feels very thin and flimsy, this will probably get worn through or snap off my neck in no time."
5,Eagle Undercover Neck Pouch,"I didn't like it at first. I wanted a trifold neck wallet so I sewed some velcro to the back side material and found that the material is very tough and not easy to sew at all. It's a lot tougher than it looks. The neck sash seems flimsy but it's pretty strong also and pretty well attached to the body of the wallet. I can now fold the lower 1/3 part up so it holds on the itself making an ""S"" shape. It's only half as big as it was before and not that much thicker.By making it a trifold, the pockets are now closed (folded shut) and the change and other stuff doesn't fall out plus it fits right under my arm when worn over the head and one shoulder. The bills fit nicely, too. My credit cards and driver's license fit in the zippered front flap and receipts fit nicely in the netted pouch.I really like it and it's perfect for skiing and sports use.I give it 5 stars as a tri-fold wallet. Only 3 stars as a pouch."
2,Travel Purse,I bought for my mother who is going to Italy. She says its just OK. She felt vulnerable still. But I think that's just her...
3,"moderately interesting; less revealing than promised, but...","This performance, the last by Ms. Elke Sommer, supposedly before she did films outside of Europe, has a moderately interesting story, where Ms. Sommer plays a fashion model caught up in a murder and some intrigue in Europe. It has one brief, all too brief, scene, of some topless women and a brief bit of breast, and some bottom, shown by Ms. Sommer, which, I guess, for 1962, was pretty revealing, but less than promised. (...) She's cute, but not worth more than what I payed for it (...)."
1,Not tonight...,"The opening title sequence is cut in half--enough said. Not a good transfer. In my opinion, this is one of the worst film transfers my eyes have ever seen. Wait for another transfer of Daniella By Night to come out at some point, and then purchase it."
1,Poor Workmanship,"I received this item, plugged it in and started to use it. It jammed with my pictures inside! I returned it per the instructions over two months ago and I am still waiting for it to be repaired or replaced.I would NOT recommend this product to anyone!"
5,Wanna knock over a street light? GO AHEAD!,"This game is awesome. The main thing that I found amazing about it is that it is SO interactive... you can knock down street lights, drive absolutely everywhere, do nearly anything that you can think of doing with a car. Flap the doors... or wait... you don't want the doors? Ok, just ram the open doors into an object to tear them off. Squish some padestrians without the guilt... they're just zombies after all. Push another opponent into the ocean then hit the brakes real hard to stop yourself going in after him! This is the kinda stuff you'll never find in games like Need For Speed... there are no rules here, do whatever you want, and the best part is, you'll probably earn credits for it... Very original and a lot of fun..."
3,Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now,"Carmageddon II is a great game if you like driving games, It's very exciting and gory. You can run over people, animals, crash on buildings. You can do lots cool stuff with the powerups. The levels and cars are very cool. The things the car does are quite unbelivable, It can destroy a truck but it's a lot of fun. It is a lot better than the first carmageddon. The graphics are just average. The controls are very difficult, It is a bit hard to drive the car but gets easy after some time. A beautiful game with lots of blood and gory and not for kids or the weak hearted."
2,as clear as muc,"The author had a hard time staying focused on the subject matter often going off on tangents. Trying to extract meaningful information on how to hold a seance, or contact the spirits was difficult at best. This 200+ page book could easily be condensed to 50."
1,This book was so messed up.,"This book didn't make sense. It would have been OK if it was more realistic but the way they wrote it, it wasn't realistic."
2,Very disappointing,"As a dyed-in-the-wool Yankee, I've always been fascinated by Southern women, with their charm, conversational ability and (usually) great style sense, and wish I could learn some of their secrets. Yet at the same time, I don't entirely trust them to be sincere. Anyway, I thought for sure this book would be full of hints and tricks I could use, but it wasn't. A lot of what Ronda Rich says is plain ol' common sense that even we crude Yankee girls know (like, don't be a (...) to your co-workers -- duh) -- and the rest of it is all nauseating, honey-dripping insincerity. If there were a little more humor and self-deprecation in the book, it might be a fun read, but she comes across as SO smug and so ""Our way is the ONLY way to do everything, and we have all the answers.""(...)As some other reviewers said, I had no desire to keep this or to pass it on to anyone else!"
1,What Southern Women....... ad nauseum= 1 star minus,"I have never thrown a new book away without passing itor donating it, but this book, honestly, was so thick w/sticky, goopy syrup that I did not want anyone else tomuss their hands. Ms. Rich is an insult to the southernwoman and I do hope that no one thinks the averagesouthern woman could possibly be that phony. She needsto pour that syrup into a jar and sell it and not try and pourit between pages. As a true southern belle, I am absolutelyappalled and insulted w/ Ms. Rich's interpretation of a southern woman?!!"
3,Mixed Feelings,"Being a southerner myself, I relished reading how distinguished we must be from the rest of the world. I have lived in areas such as Wisconsin and New York and I must say, there is definitely a reason it is called ""southern"" hospitality and not ""northern."" I value things like being polite and kind. However, as much as I would like to buy the idea of this book, that being that southern women is ""nice"", never speaks her mind, and holds herself to a standard much higher than that of the rest of the world, I cannot. There are good people everywhere, just like there are rude trashy ones (yes even in Rich's beloved south). The antiquated belle of the south rarely exists in today's world. If it does, it exists only in that of the debutante's which is not the type of women I aspire to."
5,LOVE IT!!!!,"I don't know how I've missed this book before but a friend just gave it to me for my birthday. I read it through in one sitting and now I read a section from it every day as a little pick-me-up and encourager to get me through the day. I want to be reminded on a daily basis that graciousness and courtesy is important and that without humor, we can't survive this life.Like a glass of ice cold sweet tea on a hot summer's day, this book hits the spot. If you're a Southern woman, DON'T miss this jewel."
1,a mix of good and VERY BAD advice,"The first half of this book was fairly entertaining and interesting, though I disagreed with some points I felt I gained some from it. However, when I read her suggestions for getting revenge I was revolted and put the book down. I don't want to waste my time on really, really bad advice. Why would I want to clutter my mind and heart hanging on to hurts? No thank you."
2,Really?,"Well I can honestly say that I did not finish this book; I put it down shortly after reading about her sister's horrible, disfiguring accident that required attention from the family plastic surgeon: her infant ripped a large, hooped earring from her ear. Wow, not sure if that was meant as humor but I found it, as well as the whole tone of the book up to that point, to be completely frivolous and out of touch. I gave the book two stars because it does advocate using common courtesies and niceties that are often absent from our lives these days. And while some may find the instructions of wearing matching lip gloss/toe nail polish/finger nail polish or red lacy bra and matching thong with a red outfit to be helpful in being charming, I think I will look to other methods to achieve that end goal. Have a great day!"
2,NOT the real 'Steel Magnolia',Sometimes lovely and insightful but mostly silly and stereotypical. There is a great deal of snobbery in this book even though this Southern Lady claims to have had hard times they are more along the lines of chipping a nail or running out of Aquanet. I gave it 2 stars because the great embellishment and novelty of her southern lala land is somewhat entertaining.
2,Funny but Horrible at the same time!,"I gave it two stars because it does have good ideas about manners and being polite, etc...but I really felt like some of the advice was disturbing - especially about sexual confrontations at the work place. I also felt like her advice and accompanying stories were too easy. Things don't always happen as she says they will. Life is not that predictable. Only one or two stories telling how her advice works just didn't cut it for me."
1,I now hate my job,"For those of us who were clueless enough to try Ronda's suggestions, too bad. It's only caused sexual harassment at work, because when a guy flirts with you, unless you don't care for your job, don't do as she advocates and ignore it by laughing it off. I'm left with two sexual harrassment guys at work, but I don't want to report them to HR, because it's just stupid and I'd rather not deal with it. Because of her BAD advice, I'm stuck in an uncomfortable situation, because you HAVE to nip it in the bud. I'm looking for a book on reversing the situation where disrespect toward women is so prevalent! What an idiot she is."
5,"Sweet, Sexy, and Sassy - The Art of Being a Southern Woman","Ronda Rich has created a ""must buy"" for every American woman - and a ""will want to buy"" for every red-blooded man. She has revealed the secrets that southern women hold dear to the heart. We are feminine, but don't let the appearance fool you - we are strong, capable, thriving creatures. We don't manipulate - we coax and convince and seduce - and all in the best interest of others (of course!).The book is a humorous combination of personal family stories mixed with southern life philosophy. Ronda is a captivating writer. You won't put the book down until you finish - and then you'll just pick it back up to start it again. With Christmas just around the corner, I will be buying a copy for every girlfriend I have - southern or not! I'm looking forward to seeing what Miss Rich comes out with next year!"
1,HOGWASH,"I am from the South as were my ancestors for at least 5 generations. I was reared by a wonderful mother who also taught me to say yes ma'am and yes sir and to wear dresses to funerals and wakes and that's just being respectful whether you are from the North, South, East or West, but this garbage about flirting and short skirts and always getting your way by manipulation is bull. We don't all sit around drinking mint julips either!! The days of Gone with the Wind are GONE!! Get over it!!"
1,not pleased,"I still have an open mind about this product, but am not happy with its performance. I am a medical student going into residency and use my PDA all the time to look up drugs and confirm patient care...The battery sticks out about 0.5 cm from the back of the PDA. No big deal. I remove the protector anyway to reduce volume and to not have to deal with cover in my hand. I was willing to put up with the bulky battery. I was looking forward to the extra battery life, but the product does not sit easily in the cradle (not an understatement). This is a problem in getting the device to sync and charge. I tried to charge the battery without the cradle and had no luck. The indicator light never comes on so you can not see if it is charging. Eventually the battery indicator on the PDA showed it was depolarizing. Something is wrong with at least the battery I purchased and I will be going back to the original one I have."
4,Cheesy/sleazy Italian horror movies >>>>>>> everything else,"Oh man, I just love those cheesy/sleazy Italian horror movies! They're just so bad that they're awesome! This movie isn't as entertaining as Burial Ground, Zombie Holocaust, Patrick Still Lives, Hell of the Living Dead, Rats: Night of Terror, Cannibal Ferox, Nightmare City, Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals, Massacre in Dinosaur Valley, Zombi 3, Zombie 4: After Death, etc... It's pretty slow in parts like Anthropophagus, but it has deliciously bad acting, hilarious dubbing, some pretty damn (unintentionally) funny bits of dialogue, a soundtrack that would fit well in an old porn movie and some nice gore scenes! If you enjoyed some of the movies that I mentioned, watch it!"
4,great,great bloody italian slasher film by joe d'amato. doesnt drag like anthropophagous did at times. recommend
2,HORRIBLE IS HORRIBLE,"HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANTHROPOPHAGUS, AND REALLY HAS NO PLOT. A GUY IS HOSPITALIZED FOR IMPALING HIMSELF ON A FENCE, HE HEALS OVERNIGHT CAUSE HE'S A NUCLEAR TEST DUMMY GONE WRONG, THEN HE ESCAPES GOES TO A RANDOM HOUSE AND TRIES TO KILL EVERYONE INSIDE UNTILL HE GETS DECAPITED BY A LITTLE GIRL. THERES NO STORY HERE, BAD GORE, AND TRUST ME I LOVE OTHER D AMATO FILMS LIKE BEYOND THE DARKNESS ECT.. AND ITALIAN HORROR IN GENERAL, BUT THIS MOVIE IS HORRIBLE. ITS ONE OF THOSE YOU WATCH ONCE WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO BREAK BUT IT NEVER DOES, NOT SOMETHING YOUD WANNA REPEAT, DEFINITLY NOT WORTH SPENDING 20 BUCKS ON."
3,Not what i expected,"This book shows the other side of the mobster. It focuses more on his home life and the person he was to his wife and children. It was a decent book but I expected a more detailed story about the ""mobster"" Roy Demeo rather than the ""family man"""
3,Do not read if you want to learn about the mafia,"This is not a true mafia book, its more BS then anything. Im an avid mafia and true crim reader but this book was just bad."
4,A Book Hard to Put Down,"This book is written from the perspective of a son of a top mob man. It's a sad story, recounting the author's youth and the way he finds out about his father. Life isn't black and white; there are alot of shades of grey and this book explores that. The author doesn't find his father's life ""okay,"" yet he loves him as a son would. The father is written about as not only a loving father and husband, but as someone who is kind to animals. It really shows how people like this famous mob man can ""split off"" from their role as a loving father/husband to ruthless killer. A psychological study."
5,Excellent read. Read in 12 hours time,"Very engrossing book. I think Albert did a splendid job on this. I read a lot of Mafia related books and tend to think some stories sound a little far fetched but I find myself to believe everything Albert writes is probably really accurate as opposed to some books. I found myself tearing up a few times while reading this because his emotions really come through in the pages of this book. Just the idea of this poor kid staying awake night after night to see if his father was coming home really hit me. I felt for Albert reading this. I also found it heart-wrenching how people outside ""the life"" constantly judged him for being Roys kid. I recommend this book if you want to see how the families of ""The Family"" had lived. I loved the whole story at the beginning with the rabid squirrel. It would make a great scene in a comedy movie. Anyway, I am glad Albert seems to have found peace and hope he has a very enriching future."
4,Engaging work of fiction,"I had a hard time believing that a child could have total recall of the details of life and actual conversations from such an early age. I read it as an interesting work of fiction, and like most reviewers here found it hard to put down. It's a great read but just a little hard to believe in such a precocious child. 4 stars because I had a great read, but not a book to love."
4,For the sins on my father,I think that this was a good book because it was about life and death being in the mafia. I am not part of a gang but I was excited to read this book. This was a good book because the mobster's son grew up and started to follow his father's footstep but ended being a leader. He decided to live his own life instead of being killed as his father did. He has been through a lot from the beginning to the end of the story. I have learned that the reconciliation of a leader and follower is that the outcome of being a leader will lead to success. I would recommend this book to my cousin because he lives in New York and part of a gang.
4,"A Mafia Killer, His Son, and the Legacy of a Mob Life","For The Sins of My Father was a very good book. I say this because it kept you on the edge of your seat the whole time. It showed you the life of a mob capo and his son (Roy and Albert DeMeo) and all of the obstacles they went through. I think Albert did a good job with taking us through every event that he went through, and showed a whole other side about the mob."
4,"great book,,a must read novel!","The novel ""For the sins of my father""is a great book.it's filled with drama where you won't know what's going to happen next.My favorite character is al because he the character that grows the most during the course of the book.it felt like i seen him grown from a boy in the mafia to a man in the mafia.al's father roy put him in a postion that he knew was going to have to take over when he departed.so that made him grow faster then your average tennage"
2,don't bother,The kid doesn't know anything about his father other then what the police knew. you can find a lot better book about Demeo
3,A family tale.,"This is a good insiders account of the notorious DeMeo faction of the NY Mob. Its a good book and hard to put down. It provides a nice counterpoint to ""Murder Machine"" and ""Iceman"" However, I'm not sure what the author's problem is exactly. He had a good childhood and had everything going for him as an adult, why the nervous breakdown, failed marriage, alcohol problems etc? So your father was a hired killer. So are lots of fathers... Well, maybe not...but I still don't see why the author was so miserable."
4,It was good,I enjoyed it but tv shows seem expensive and HD version looks real nice but I don't believe it is the extra cost nice.
2,Nothing New.,You've seen this plot in hundreds of other horror flicks (mostly in the 70's) and the acting was appalling. I thought this series was sub-par enough that I cancelled my season pass at around episode 4. No interest at all in what happens next.Truly a bore.
2,I don't see it lasting...,"I don't see this lasting but one season. I wouldn't be surprised if ABC canceled it. It doesn't have the longevity that a lot of other TV shows have and the story line is going to get old and boring over time. The first episode wasn't even promising, it was mediocre, maybe because it's on ABC. And I understand it is the first episode, but the first episode is supposed to grab you and make you want to watch the next episode. I was expecting a more spooky and chilling vibe and I was not satisfied. But again it's ABC and they usually run family oriented shows, even if the shows have a little sex in them. I think if it were on another network and were rewritten to match the novel it would be a good mini-series, maybe AMC should have grabbed it. It is safe to say that I will not carry on with the series."
5,Cool but creepy,The series gave me nightmares... and I do not scare easily. But I do support Vanessa Williams. She needs the job.
3,"""Overlook"" hotel is back","Heavily borrowed on the Shining by Steven King, his image of the Overlook hotel in the mountains is sort of transplanted right in to the heart of Manhattan to represent an upscale building with the same dark powers, obviously. May be the hint of the Rosemary's baby in addition, but all in all very entertaining and eerie enough to keep you watching..I stand corrected, if the first episode was promising and intriguing, the second was flat to say the least, disappointed..."
5,One of the Best New Shows,OMG this is one of the best new shows on TV. Can't wait until new season. Please bring this show back for another season. Love it!!!
1,Full of 'huh?' stories,"Going Postal was a big letdown. It follows the trendof most horror anthologies today -- it's chock full of'huh?' stories. At the end of each story, the reactiontends to be ""Huh? What was *that* about?"" The onlyblessing is that the stories are mercifully short!"
4,very informative,"easy to follow instructions and good cultural side bars. It was required for a class, so I didn't compare it to anything else."
3,It didn't have everything,This book all though it had the bind in card from the publisher did not have the book key for quia.com which was what my professor uses. I bought online because I thought I was getting everything for less but it ended up being the same amount as if I had bought it in the school bookstore because I also had to purchase the quia key. So the moral of the story is that if you need quia just buy it at the bookstore and then you won't have to wait for your book.
4,What is your worldview?,"As always, Sproul here is concise, lively, opinionated and learned. He convincing shows that the reigning *Ism* of modern Western culture is secularism. This is not the same as atheism. Less than ten percent of American claim to have strong doubts about the existence of God. But most all of us live our lives as if God did not exist, or was irrelevent. Sproul examines many of the thoughts and movements that contribute to this secular worldview that so dominates American culture. This is worth a careful read for most anyone who cares about the state of the American heart."
4,Chilling Tales in the Jamesian Tradition!,"This collection of six little-known ghost stories was first published in 1919, when the author, a renowned architect, was in his eighties. His antiquarian interests show through in these stories, which are set between the seventeenth century and Edwardian eras in England. While the elements of the supernatural are not as malevolent as in some of the tales of M. R. James, they have nearly the same feel.Recommended to all fans of the British golden-era ghost story."
2,Kind of dry (but not dry enough to start a fire),"I didn't really like this book that much. Nance does show that he is an aviation expert, as he goes into a new realm that is outside the traditional aviation disaster genre, but I just felt like the whole plot dragged and was very predictable. In my opinion, Nance's earlier works were much better. If there was one book of his I would not get, there's a good chance it would be this one."
3,"Seriously, CIA?","For the most part, this book was fairly entertaining and populated by a decent cast of characters. Clark, Karen, and Bill Deason were very likable and saved this book from becoming more or less a giant fact sheet on the ails of wildland firefighting via air tanker.What got me was the CIA subplot (if it could be called that). What that felt like was an editor or publisher's hand in trying to force some unneeded intrigue into what was already a fine book. There would have been nothing wrong with having a story that featured a straight up greedy jerk who was running a shady operation because all he cared about was money. Add in something like spooks and it made the whole story come off as slightly silly.I wouldn't mind seeing another work with Clark, Karen, and Bill featured in it, sans the intelligence angle."
4,Portrays characters as firefighting heros they represent.,"I read this can't-put-down book in 4 lazy Maui vacation afternoons. It's not a documentary nor a textbook; it is a look inside the dangerous but wild ride of initial attack firefighting. I enjoyed the characterizations & the technical edification. The book did a great job giving me enough flight detail to gain general understanding of piloting without losing me in the technical aspects. I took John's advice to visit his website & read further on his link: The National Crisis Behind FIREFLIGHT. I'm sure I represent his target audience whereas some reviewers might not. Did prior reviewers who complained about the technical or moral value of this story chose to ignore Nance's effort to provide the non-fire readership excellent background & understanding of the aerial firefighting issues? Do yourself a favor: buy, read & discuss this novel."
1,BORING,"After reading all of the glowing reviews I purchased this book and was extremely disappointed - I found the characters uninteresting and the story extremely boring...I forced myself to keep reading, but after several chapters I just couldn't go on. I strongly suggest you read a few pages before purchasing, you may save yourself some money!!"
2,Sportslick,"After reading all of the good reviews, I expiated good things. Unfortunately, it didn't really do that much for my feet. They still look & feel extremely calloused. Would not buy again."
5,Perfect lube for distance running,Picked up a tube of his several yeas ago at an expo and fell in love with it. Extremely long lasting which is great for marathons and ultra marathons. My chaffing completely resolved using this and a small amount goes a long way. Extremely difficult to locate at local running store or at recent expos so I was happy to find it here at a competitive price
4,"It's petroleum based and it works OK, but it's a big tube.","This is certainly ""more for the money,"" but I don't think it's anything special. It does have antibacterial/antifungal ingredients, but it's greasy when applied because of the petroleum. I think it's slightly better than using vaseline. This goes double for the feet since that's generally where the athlete's foot occurs.The reason I gave it four stars instead of three is because the tube is much larger for the price than any of the similar products out there.I'll finish the tube as it does prevent chaffing, but probably won't order it again."
1,A review of the Techko C505PZ,This is a review of another pepershredder made by TechKo. Stay as far away as possible. It has stopped working and I have sent it back no less than four times. Shipping costs for sending back faulty equipment has easily cost more than the initial price. Absolutely terrible.
2,Don't buy.,"Simply put, it did not work. Also, the package appeared to have been opened like perhaps it had been previously returned by an unsatisfied customer.I'm really glad that Amazon paid shipping costs for the return."
1,Defective product,"Tried two of these and was not able to get the sound function working for either. Good service and fast shipping, but save your money and time by not ordering this piece of junk."
3,Desire to bake a fruit cake,"A cute romantic adventure involving a very much loved hero who has a great sense of humor. After reading this book, one has a different perspective on fruitcakes. I'll definitely be more open the next time I see a fruitcake recipe or a fruitcake."
2,Dissapointing,"The story really sounded interesting to me: the guys a pilot with a pooch so that would spell some adventure. Shes afraid of flying and a bit of a ""stuff shirt"", quite his opposite. U can do much with this combination but the author chose not to do anything with it! I felt that she was too much in a hurry to finish this book that she skimmed over the entire story. It was not worth what l paid for!"
2,TOO Predictable!!!!!,"I'm very surprised that this book has gotten such good reviews from Amazon readers because most of the time I agree with the overall rating on amazon items.I didn't agree this time. This book was WAY TOO PREDICTABLE which made it BORING!!!! I like happy endings at least as much as most people, but this book didn't have any suspense whatsoever - I just couldn't wait to finish it! I didn't care about the characters at all - they weren't developed enough, and I was very disappointed with this story."
1,Author Can't Give Directions,"Neat hikes - but don't rely on this book to get you there. The directions for about half the hikes are poorly written and sometimes lack information.Often the driving instructions start in the middle of no-place, and then refer to other hikes for further detail - ""Drive the Middle Fork Road to the Taylor River (Hike 16)"". In at least one case you have to consult three different hikes before you can construct a trip plan.Highway exit #'s are frequently left out. Other times the exit # is mentioned, but the direction of travel from the exit is not.Sometimes the direction is given in terms of a landmark - ""drive 436 AVE NE towards Rattlesnake Lake""- which is fine if you know the area in detail - but then why would you need directions in the first place?I don't so much blame the author - as the editor - who should've caught and corrected this kind of problem before going to print.Besides that - the book seems OK. But, if you can't get there - what's the point?"
5,A Family Horrified,"Surviving Murder is a chilling tale about a family who is profoundly changed in the aftermath of a double homicide. Principe's skillful writing style captures each detail describing the gruesome scene of the crime to the grueling trial years later. Emotional and intense, the memoir pays tribute to family loyalty and survival."
1,"Worst Drive, Even Worse Support","I purchased this drive thinking it would be the ultimate laptop add on, it turned out to be the ultimate headache nightmare. Archos does not supply a specific driver for the drive. Archos claims you can use the Windows drivers just fine, however, the PCMCIA Card interface never did work. The tech support person told me to ""just run it on USB and don't use the PCMCIA card, it doesn't work"". Also per the tech service guy, it does not support the 800 mb cd's. Don't waist your time or money buying it only to return it disappointed."
2,To Much $,"I saw this burner in a store, entered my name for the give away and to my suprise I won! It works pretty good,but it cost a lot of money for what you get."
2,How do I make it work all the time??,"Well, I only give this product 2 stars because when it works it's really nice, but unfortunately once I plug it in and works, then I restart and can't even load Windows!!! I have to plug my old setup back in to restart and get into windows, and I really don't think that's the way it's supposed to work. I've already tried installing the latest drivers from Microsoft and different other things but nothing has worked, I'm really getting frustrated with this thing.If anybody knows how to get this thing to work permanently, I would really appreciate it."
1,Modifier Keys Are Broken,"This keyboard has a lot of nice features, but it falls down on the basics. The modifier keys (alt, ctrl, Shift, Winkey) un-press themselves. For example, if you hold down alt and press tab repeatedly, you would expect to cycle through active applications. If you do this long enough, this keyboard acts as if you had released the alt key. ""Long enough"" is variable -- sometimes 2 keystrokes, sometimes 20+.I tried it with Win XP, and the problem showed up. I booted in safe mode, and the problem showed up. I booted another operating system (Knoppix) and the problem showed up.I ran a keyboard diagnostic routine, the keyboard is sending a key-release scan code for the modifier key, even though I am holding the key down firmly.I have two of these keyboards. Each exhibits the problem. Either it is a design flaw, or they have a defect in the manufacturing process."
3,Good product/minor issues,"My Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 4000 has been a nice addition. So far, everything is working fairly well. The strength of the wireless keyboard and mouse are very good. Overall, I am very pleased.2 minor issues are: 1) the spacebar easily gets stuck, 2) one of the rubber stoppers on the bottom of the keyboard was missing when I received the keyboard."
2,Blah,"Keyboard: Great. A solid product, and I have no complaints.Mouse: Poor. Eats batteries like mad. Not smooth or responsive at all; possibly a weak signal, however, mine was only a couple feet from the antenna. Also seems fussy when used with solid-color mousepads. Bah!Antenna: Eh, yet another space-waster. Why can't these things be contained in a smart little dongle, instead of in a big honkin paperweight that sits on my desk and ads to my spaghetti of cords? Other keyboards do it better, why can't Microsoft?Conclusion: I use the keyboard, which works fine for me, except that I resent the size of the antenna. As for the mouse, I THREW IT AWAY (yes, I actually did) and replaced it with a better stand-alone model. In short, if you can buy the keyboard by itself, go for it and just buy a different mouse sepatately."
2,Great functions but to low a range for a wireless,I purchased this set because of the funtions it offered including the comfort keyboard that was curved and not all the way broken and a very quite scroll mouse...the keyboard had lots of great functions and while I was willing to overlook the questionable zoom slider on the keyboard that looked like it could break off at any moment...for the money I spent on a wireless keyboard and mouse I could not overlook the short range of about 6-8inches from the reciever...this went back the next day...I now have a Logitech MX3200 keyboard and mouse that I purchased from Dell online for $67 that has a much better range of 6-8 feet.
1,you are broadcasting your passwords everyone in a 10-meter radius!,"I bought this for the convenience of using it with Windows Media Center from the couch, for which it excels.However, during a commercial, i decided to log in to my bank account until i realized dangerous that could be. After doing some quick research, I learned that Microsoft's encoding was cracked long ago, and that anyone within a 10-15meter radius who wants to could easily monitor everything you type: passwords, gossip, your google searches, everything.I'm in a NYC apartment building, so I was at more risk than anyone in the suburbs, but be forewarned!"
3,Mouse Problems,"i had the same problem with the mouse as J.Eggar, with the left mouse button hardly working... i took the left battery out (leaving only one of the 2 supplied batteries in the mouse) and it seems to have fixed the problem!!this worked for me so hopefully others with the same problem will find it helpful"
2,Below expectations,"I purchased this product for my laptop computer. It has a good look but my problem started from the very first day, I downloaded the software. It disabled the keyboard of my laptop. So far I have tried all my effort to sort out the problem but in vain. And now I have to travel with this keyboard whereever I go !!!!Now for last few days another problem has started. Key for number 3 is not functioning properly. Even all the keys are a bit noisy and I prefer quite keysI will definitely not recommend this product."
1,Bad Mouse,"I purchased this keyboard/mouse set for my wife and the mouse didn't seem to be working properly. Button lag and left click didn't always work, to the point of extreme annoyance.We took the set back and traded it in for a different one thinking that it was a faulty mouse. Still no luck. The mouse lags horribly when clicking (motion seems ok) and the left button just plain doesn't work but about half the time, if that. Very annoying."
4,"Very good set, some mouse problems","The keyboard is the icing on the cake: I just love the zoom sliding button. Great in Excel, CorelDraw and with the Firefox browser. The same goes for the 5 ""favorites"" buttons that can be used to short cut to documents or applications. The ergonimics is good if not great. The not-quiet-leather support for the wrists is fantastic. The mouse works good but not great.One problem I noticed: I have 2 of these kits, one in the office, one at home. At home, I'm constantly struggling with the mouse. The wireless communication is being disturbed by (probably) my cordless phone nearby or whatever. The cursor jumps erratically over the screen every few minutes. Very annoying and couldn't be resolved yet (Correction 2 months later: I resolved it by attaching the Mouse to the PS/2 port instead of USB. Too many USB devices, apparently) I still give it 4 stars because it works flawlessly in my office. Looks cool, too..."
2,Power Hunger,"As most of Microsoft products this one functions fairly well but the devil is in the detail as Mom used to say. Support for these small products is all but non-existant. I read the limited directions but could find no references to how to stop the mouse batteries from draining overnight, short of removing them every time I shut down the computer. I have resorted to re-chargable ""AA"" batteries that I rotate in and out. The range is good and the keybord layout is nice but these things seem irrelavant if the power keeps draining away."
4,"Keyboard is good, not sure about the mouse","I've installed the keyboard and the mouse. The mouse worked about a week, the keyboard is still going strong after about a month. I expect if I shut everything down and re-install the software, the mouse will probably work, but I've not had time and the old wired mouse still works fine. When it was working, the mouse was good for a distance of about 6 feet away from the receiver. I'd hoped for more, like across the room to the recliner :0) I'll get everything going, but if I had it to do over again, I'd probably purchase the two separately, so that I could return just the one that wasn't working right."
3,Mostly great...,"The keyboard is nicely designed and works well, but the mouse is so s-l-o-w. It takes several clicks to get it to select anything and another several clicks to activate what you finally selected. Maybe it can be tweaked with the included software but for now I've gone back to my regular mouse. Another issue is distance...the instructions are clear as to how far you can get from the transmitter and that ain't far. Not a bad deal for the money, though."
4,"Really good, if maybe not ergonomic enough","This is probably Microsoft's best-made Keyboard yet. It feels solid and steady, much more so than previous ones, and well-made. The Keys have great feedback and it looks and feels like a high-end peripheral. The 'faux leather' palm-rest works very well. The mouse unfortunately is not MS' high-end explorer, but the more simple optical mouse. It works well, but will leave some longing for the better contoured, button-rich explorer 3.0. The keyboard shape itself is a bit of a mixed bag, it feel like Microsoft tried to do everyone right, and missed it slightly either way: If you want a truly ergonomic board, don't get this; you can beat MS' own Optical Keyboard Pro (true ergo, and split). This is more akin to a more comfortable standard keyboard than something truly ergonomically styled. But, if that doesn't bother you, this is a good buy at a good price. Wireless works absolutely flawlessly, though the reach could be a tad bit farther."
1,Bad for living room or far away,"I placed my mac in my living room because there is another pc in my room. I decided to buy a cordless desktop to avoid wires running across the living room. I bought this for cheap at another major store. Once installed it was a hassle to setup and after that it became a pain in the arse. The main culprit is very weak signal. The mouse would jitter; the keyboard would become unresponsive. It would only work nearly well if I'm at a distance of 2 feet, at most. Do not buy this if you are unable to get this close to the receiver. This is a very poor product. I recommend the Logitech brand; it works perfectly."
2,Mouse aggravation,"I like the keyboard well enough, though having the caps lock light on the receiver rather than on the keyboard itself is silly. The ""F lock"" thing was very frustrating to figure out. But I have no real issue with the keyboard.The mouse is another story. The mouse generally does not function at all if it is more than two inches away from the receiver. Seriously, two inches. It really defeats the point of having a wireless mouse. My last wireless mouse was from Dell and I kept the receiver three feet away from the mouse with no issues whatsoever, so this new mouse is very frustrating. Weirdly, I can take the keyboard halfway across the room and it still works. The mouse also goes through batteries at an amazing rate."
2,Sticky mouse button?,"My initial experience with this keyboard/mouse was very good, but it has not remained that way. The mouse buttons have developed a fairly common tendency to be ignored by the system. In other words, although the keyboard and cursor send their signals to and they are received by the computer with apparently no trouble, the mouse buttons require numerous depressions (or extremely forceful whackings to send their signal to the computer. Sometimes the solution is to move the mouse while maintaining pressure on the button. Unfortunately a couple of times this ""solution"" has resulted in folders or files being moved when that was not the intent! I'm not very happy."
5,Wireless keypad and mouse,The wireless keyboard and mouse were purchased as a set (one box) on 12/27/07. They arrived very quickly and I installed them with haste. They were easy to install. I am enjoying the shape of the keyboard easy to use - for a 63 year old who never had typing - the extra buttons on the side and top of the keyboard really make this a step up from my old keyboard - and the mouse with its side to side motion also make its use really nice.I visited my son two days ago and low and behold he has the same setup on his computer - for more than a year. I like the keyboard wrist rest and the angled shape. The price was right and reasonable. Wish I had more computers to purchase more keyboards for. Wireless is the way to go - no more junky wires all over.
4,Wirells Desktop 4000,"We have deployed 2 or 3 of these sets and have not experienced the battery issues that others have. Our users like the ergonomic mouse and keyboard design, however myself being a lefty, I can not effectively use the mouse for long periods of time."
2,Gearxs terrible business--AVOID,"I purchased the Microsoft 4000 desktop set from Amazon sold by gearxs. The product list said it was new. However, the product appeard used had no install software and missing other accessories. The microsoft 4000 desk set is an ok product but not essential. I highly reccomend against buyng anything form Gearxs. They don't tell truth about their prodcuts, want consider a refund and want even work with you on anything."
1,Does not work for games,"This keyboard and mouse has a great feel, and is great for casual use. However, this combo is HORRIBLE for gaming. The keyboard has a serious flaw that will ""release"" a key even while it is still pressed down. The result is in many games (and even some programs) while you are holding down a key (in a first person shooter you often hold W to run) it will suddenly stop responding. You will still be holding W down, but the keyboard won't be registering this. This makes playing 90% of games an aggravating experience. Microsoft has refused to acknowledge that this is a defect, and says that the keyboard is still usuable and they probably won't fix it in the future. Gamers beware!"
2,Bad connections after time,"I've had this keyboard for 2+ years and had always been great. Quick to type, love the ergo shape. However lately its been really annoying. Its really slow on the connection, so it takes 6+ seconds to type 1 letter. And I really can't spend hours to type 1 sentence. Very disappointed."
4,Very cute!,"My daughter loves this lunch bag. It is perfect size and very cute! The only thing we didn't like is that the strap is a little long. We had to tie it in a knot so it doesn't drag the floor, but other than that, great lunch bag."
3,Interactive Toy,"This toy feels sturdy and durable. The one I received is pink and it's pretty cute.It zips along very nicely on my wood floor. It is not suitable for a plush carpet.I think it will last a long time.The cats like to chase it, but don't do much with it after it stops moving.I think the best way to play with this toy is to send the mouse back and forth between two people. The cats will follow it and will be great fun to watch. It's the kind of toy that needs your involvement and interaction, not the kind of toy that your cat will play with alone."
2,"Useless, unfortunately","I got this so that I could send it away and let my cat run after it. It moves a whole inch on my carpets. My cat is not interested, and it is quite too big for her. I am going to stick with the smaller fabric mice I can get at Petco and just throw it for her to fetch. She prefers that anyway."
3,Good zoom bad mechanics,A large zoom range. Most others don't go as high as 140 for the price. I did not shoot photos with it because I was put off by the noise of the zoom lens. The camera was not as small or balanced as I had hoped. Plus the zoom is not continuous. It jumps to preset settings.
2,Too bad it didn't last!,"I bought this camera about 2 1/2 years ago. I was very satisfied with the picture quality under a variety of conditions. Unfortunately, a couple of weeks ago it quit focusing. As it turns out for this type of camera all photo repair shops send the unit in to Olympus to have it repaired. If you want you can send it to Olympus directly yourself. The problem is that regardless of the problem, the repair is a flat rate ... which is rapidly approaching the cost of just buying a replacement camera. Disappointing..."
5,impact resistant,"i went skiing recently with the camera around my neck, caught an edge and did a face plant, sliding on my chest down the ravine, into the bushes. When i finally crawled out, i checked my camera which was covered in snow, even though the cover was closed, but the pictures came out fine and the camera works great. a little condensation on the lenses."
2,A Poor Showing By Olympus,"Disappointment is the best word to use in describing this camera. It has nice features with the zoom, self-timer, red-eye reduction, etc., but in the end cameras need to take good photographs and this one doesn't. I found the picture quality to be quite poor-- the colors are dull, not vibrant, especially when taking outdoor shots. The zoom lens also is a bit too much-- when you go to 140, the picture tends to blur. And I should add that the camera shutter speed is slow so you better have steady hands if you buy this one.This camera was a major shock to me. I purchased an Olympus SR70 (I think that's the model) back in 1991 and I never had a problem with it. Plus it took fantastic shots. After 11 years, it still takes better pictures than the Stylus Zoom."
3,Dark Pictures,"We bought this camera for the 140-zoom. We're very happy with the zoom and all the easy-to-use features. However, the pictures sometimes come out dark even on bright sunny days. After reading the other reviews, we are either taking pictures at the wrong angle or using the wrong film (400-speed) or using a poor developer. If we figure it out, we'll let you know."
5,I had one,I had one. A friend dropped it from a three story roof and it broke. I immediately bought another one. Can't imagine buying any other brand or model (love the 140 zoom).
2,Unreliable,"I bought my Olympus in August 1999. A year and 8 days later, the slide cover jammed rendering the camera unusable. My camera shop sent the camera back to Olympus for repair and it was fixed for $120. Olympus noted that the one year warranty was barely expired but made no accomodation. One year later, in August 2001, my camera jammed again in the same way. I returned to the camera shop and explained my predicament and displeasure and they sent the camera to Olympus who responded with an estimate for $112. Who needs a camera that costs $100 plus every year beyond the initial cost. Not to mention being caught on vacation without a camera.Beyond the repair issue, I found the picture quality to be mediocre; worse than the Nikon that was my previous camera or the Olympus's that I owned before that."
5,Very Pleased with the Camera,"You are never really quite sure what you are going to get when you order something site unseen. I was very happy with the camera, but reserved my opinion until I actually put film in the camera and used it and saw the final product. These folks are the real thing. I was so very pleased that I will definitely recommend them and order from them again in the future. I got a nice camera for a very reasonable price...what more can I ask for. And it worked perfectly!"
4,Great Gift!!!,"I was so lucky to have found this for my mom...she is not ready for digital, yet the Olympus is her favorite camera. So I am so happy to have found it and for a reasonable price to boot. It's very easy to use and my mom loves it!!!"
3,If you get a black stripe in your prints....,"... just open the back of the camera and put the little, black plastic doohickey back in it's place. my european vacation prints were ruined cuz you don't know this has happened till you print them out. clerk at photo store said this happens with other cameras too. no need to ship camera and pay bucks to fix this."
1,Buyer Beware,"I bought this camera as a back-up for my SLR camera. First, this camera is not very compact. Second, the flap that slides over the lens when the camera is not on, seems very cheap and does not look like it would hold up to wear and tear. Also, the zoom lever on top of the camera is not user friendly. It is very small and it too looks as though it would not stand up to wear and tear. Another bad point is that the lever to open the camera back is hard to use. The most important thing is that when I had the camera set to use the red-eye reducer, ALL of the pictures came back with red-eye. It DOES NOT WORK. I have studied photography and am not a casual photographer. In my opinion, this camera is not worth the ... it costs. I promptly returned mine."
5,This camera is VERY easy to use!,"I bought this camera about a month ago, and I'm delighted with the pictures it takes. It's very easy to use, and had several features that other cameras in the same price range didn't offer. For the money, I think it's the best camera that you can buy."
5,stargate atlantis - simply the best,THis series just got better and better and it is beyond me why they cancelled it. All the characters have their different personalities which expanded during the series. Some to the storylines were brilliant and my favorite was when Rodney had the parasite in his brain- David Hewlett's acting was phenomenal in that particular episode - worthy of an oscar We were so upset when it finished. Are there going to be any follow up episodes as they did with SG1 - why stop when it was so good - can't understand why. Beat Battlestar Galactica without any doubt - no comparison between the two series and to my mind got better as each season progressed. COme on writers get cracking on some follow up episodes like you did with SG1.
4,Ending a series,"I guess there are just som many plots that you can come up with in a galaxy far far away, but still I liked it. Knowing that it was the last season kept me waiting to see how it would end. Right up until the end it just carried on like it was goin to go on for years. Then the last episode ""BOOM"" all of it in all at once. I hope there is a movie coming out now to tie it together. Isn't that what is supposed to happen?"
1,pointless,"I normally don't take the time to review this program because it is fiction for the purpose of entertainment but this episode did not even contain the basic parts of a story (intro, rising conflict, climax, resolution, conclusion). Nor, did this episode fit in to the larger star gate story line. this was just lazy writing, with zombies and hot chicks to make up for the lack of imagination and skill."
5,Really Love these series,Really Love these series keeeps the imagination going. I think people love to elaborate on tail they have heard throughout their youth and keep the tails alive.
5,Perfect,"When my copy os Season 5 of SG Atlantis showed up the longest it took for me to open it and put in disc one was how long it took me to figure out which of the new mail boxes at our complex was mine.... long story... Anyway, I put in disc one and hit play and everything works perfectly. This copy was in great condition, I have no complaints and would use this seller again"
3,I wanted it to be better,"I know they had plans for a Season 6, so the show doesn't wrap up as neatly as it could have and I still have a place in my heart for Stargate, even if this isn't SG-1, but overall this season was disappointing. It had it's moments and I love the sci-fi and imagined history, but I just couldn't get into it anymore. Watch it for free, but I don't think there is a need to spend your money on this."
5,stargate atlantis season 5,"The return of the city of Atlantis back to earth is awesome. It also opens the door to speculations about the real existence of Atlantis here on earth today. I never expected Mr. Wulsy (Picard) to turn his personality around and be the very one that broke all the Rules of the IOA, when he was the one that was so intent in enforcing them. We finally see Dr. McCay's tender moments with his new girl friend. Season was very well executed."
5,Love it,"Love it Need to be not DRM ""Hate DRM"" Die DRM!!!! Oh well anyway Love this show. hope it lasts Mant many more years. Needs a way to burn to a dvd so you can watch on a tv"
4,Extra scene past the credits,"If you did not see it, this episode totals 50 minutes. I scanned forward after the credits and ran into a scene with Woolsey and Todd. But, there is no sound. I think this may have been cut from the episode and why it is here I do not know. I just wish it had audio."
5,Sorry To See The Series End,Stargate Atlantis is one of the top three TV series of all time for me. Since I had all previous years on DVD there was never a doubt that I would not get Season 5. This is SciFi at its best.
5,Stargate A,"This is exactly the purchase that I wanted, and the price and delivery were better than expected."
5,oh crap,"being a very long time sci fi fan from the mid 50's on, i got interested in this plot....and what a plot.......atlantis has everything you would want in a sci fi show....and the actors......freakking fantastic.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!......joe, david, racheal, jason, and all the rest....fantastic.....all the seasons were utterly great, to bad it was cut down in its high day....and oh...to you producers who started on stargate universe?......forget it......it will never come up to the atlantis status.....never......i cant wait for the sga movie to come out.....and by the way....to jason mamoa....congrats for the rumored conan movie.....i hope it works out....yopur the best for the part"
3,Lacking chemestry,Picardo did not mesh with cast felt like an outsider. Might have been intentional but took away from the enjoyment for me.
5,Great Serie finale,"I loved this series from the beginning and never missed it when it was on Syfy Channel. Getting to watch the series all over was great, and reminded me how much I liked it."
4,Should still be going,This series should still be going it just kept getting better and better why cancel it. Great boxset and price well worth it. buy it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Stargate Atlantis,"Wow!! I love this series.......the writing is great and spot on! I find all the characters equally intriguing. Shepherd is the true American hero in every sense of the word, McKay is the great geek who is afraid of everything, but finds his courage and bravery when the going gets tough. Ronan is the quiet and silent guy who goes with his feelings and Teyla is the heart of the team. The humor is sutle, but I still find moments that I have to laugh out loud. I'm only sorry that this could not have continued a few more years. I think that it far surpasses SG-1."
3,all thing come to an end,"as it was said earlier on in the begining, it wasnt expected to live up to it's sister series and go past more than 5 season's, but neither the less, it was still a good season with some odd and ends in there and some very awesome episodes, lets hope the new SGA movie Exstinction as it's titled it goona be good and that there will be more to come, as with Stargate Universe (SGU) starting soon lets hope thats as good"
5,I Love IT!!!!!!!!!!!!,A wonderful TV show that I can't believe they took of the air. I can't wait for the movies to start! I miss this show!
5,I love stargate,"I had to order this season because Netflix took the series off before I could watch the last two seasons., Wish there was more."
4,DVD Box Set,"Box DVD Set arrived extremely fast! All discs in great shape - no problems playing any of them! This series is pretty good - although I never thought Tayla's character fit very well. There will be many who disagree with that - and with my saying that Rodney is hysterical. I really didn't like him at first, but he grew on me. Now he's my favorite, even with all his many, many faults!"
1,"Not recommended - ""Advanced"" my foot!","I'm sorry to say this book falls short of my expectations. I had hoped for some interesting tips/ techniques or unusual scripts - and I found none. Particularly disappointing are the example scripts which are very poorly executed - badly formed, irregular with sloppy spacing; hardly a good reference.I regret knocking someone's work but this really did feel like a waste of money (even at its modest price)."
4,"Middle Sisters finally have their ""say""!","Had to have it, glad you offered it! Go sister go!~ Great site, too, for all things ""charming""!"
4,Fun & Nostalgic but wanted more for the money...,"Fun & Nostalgic but wanted more for the money, there were plenty of other original stories that were self-contained (not part of the on-going story arc of a series) that could have been included as well. The Marvel Team-Up featuring Spider-Man & Dracula or Marvel Super-Villain Team-Up with Dr. Doom & The Sub-Mariner. Or even (yes, I know... the worst, most unfortunately titled) Giant-Size Man-Thing with Bessie the vampire cow for a strange change of taste. I really would liked to have seen the other Fantastic Four Giant Size issues, even though they had tie-ins to other story arcs, and not just in The Fantastic Four series. The other Avengers Giant Size issues can be found in the Celestial Madonna collected release since they are the major part of that story arc, but still I hope they will continue to release other stories/issues in this series"
2,very hard to follow,"i bought this book to help me get over some resentment and anger i had toward my husband. this book did not help me. in fact, i havn't even got past the 3rd chapter. it's very hard to follow and doesn't really tell you how to get over the pain. there's alot of long words and the same words and phrases are used over and over again. i do not suggest this book."
2,"Jargon, jargon, jargon.","Flanigan's book seems to address those who have been injured on a deep level and must go through a series of exercises in order to ""name the injurer"", ""claim the injury"", ""identify the injury,"" etc. If you have suffered a horrific injury (especially as a child) and are unsure of how to come to terms with reclaiming your life, this may be the book for you. Flanigan defines ""unforgivable"" injuries as those which compromise our well-being, self-esteem and general trust in others. If you have suffered a different type of injury, such as betrayal or deceit, I recommend any of Smedes' books to navigate your way through the forgiving process. Good luck!"
5,This book is different from the rest.,"I disagree with some of the previous reviews. This book helps people overcome some of the most heinous events imaginable, where changing one's point of view cannot ease the pain. Many books deal with forgiveness of the slings and arrows of more typical human existence, and while those events may be horrible, they may not change lives to the degree of some of the events Flanigan describes. This book deals with methods to overcome the events that cause friends and family to become speechless, or worse, withdraw from the wounded in shock and confusion. It's a challenging book - take it slowly: it's well worth the effort."
1,Beware of Balancing the Scales,"Although this book offers some sound suggestions for forgiving someone, such as carefully attending to what happened to you, there is a tragic flaw in the steps proposed. That flaw is the step entitled, ""Balancing the scales."" It is basically defined as giving back what the other person dished out to you. Did your partner have an affair, ignoring you during it all? You are encouraged to withhold intimacy from the partner for a specified period of time, thus balancing the scales, as you forgive. Is this not another name for cloaked revenge? I've read some of the other self-help books on forgiveness and this notion of balancing the scales never comes up. It's just not part of what forgiveness is. So, beware if you read this book."
1,solicito apoyo tratamiento de tumor aun no diagnosticado,"en cali, colombia, mi esposa presenta un tumor en la carotida derecha (cara) y que de acuerdo a las biopsias no es maligno pero no hay diagnostico de la clase y su forma de tratamiento"
1,Many leaks,"We've had two now and the both leaked. One of them popped 4 holes! It's comfortable, but has ZERO reliability after 3-4 plane trips."
1,Poor quality control at best,"I need something like this pillow, but I've just had two of these in a row, and neither would hold air. Both completely deflated within minutes. I returned the first as defective, but after a second try, I give up. I have a friend who say's his works, so you take your chances. I'll be looking for something more reliable."
5,Great back pillow,"This is a great back pillow, easy to inflate and deflate on trips and very sturdy. The contour fits the back well."
4,My Mom Loves This,"I bought this for my Mom, who gets uncomfortable when she drives to work. She uses this pillow every day and loves it. After about 2 months of use the pillow couldn't stay inflated for more than 10 minutes. I wasn't there to check it out, but I suspect there was a problem with the air nozzle /stopper or the airtight skin. Eagle Creek has a fairly good return /repair policy so I sent it back.My Mom liked this pillow so much that I bought another pillow for her while she waits for the Eagle Creek return"
5,too cute,I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she just loves him. There is a light sensor so it wont wake her up at night. The monkey comes out and makes just enough monkey sounds that its not annoying.
5,Wife loves it.,"Works well.. Keeps time well. And it is definitely a conversation piece. Thankfully it has an eye that keeps it from Cooing at night, because when it does CooCoo it is LOUD!!"
2,Only read it if you have to :-),"Like many others, this was textbook for a sociology class. This particular text it dense, and not what many college students would consider a ""fun"" or ""quick"" read.Not that textbooks have to be enjoyable, after all they're here to teach, but certainly many of the best intellectuals I've had the pleasure of speaking to and reading -- try to narrate and make things enjoyable for the reader.This text, not so much."
4,Is corn syrup necessary?,"A friend brought back a small, sampler jar of this jam from Montana, where it's made. It was delicious! I jumped on Amazon and here it was, ready to be shipped to my door. The sampler had a very small list of ingredients that included grape juice and did not include corn syrup. This large jar, from the same manufacturer with the same label, doesn't include grape juice and does include corn syrup. The contents of the large jar are a little thicker and stickier and just doesn't taste as natural. It's still tasty, but not as 'wow' as the sampler."
2,little flavor,"when we were traveling thru montana and had a huckleberry shake it was incredible...full intense flavor.when home we remissed not buying huckleberry products, and so shopped for the montana huckleberry products. we just tried the jam and found it sorely lacking in that same intense flavor. it was far less enjoyable than trader joe's good blueberry, blackberry etc jams. what we got was meek and mild, and we thought very very sugar laden. even the french bread overwhelmed the flavor of the jam, which shows how weak the flavor is.we will soon thry the syrup and the topping and report on them. but i would pass on this. even smuckers jams fare far better in flavor."
2,problem with Amazon shipping,"I cannot rate the product because I did not open the jar. My problem was with negotiating the Amazon purchase. Although I tried to get it sent to another address along with several other items, it ended up coming to me instead. The shipping is killer. So I want to warn those out there to read the email Amazon sends you carefully, or the same thing may happen to you next time you ship something to an address other than your own. Next time I will buy directly from the merchant instead of going through Amazon. The shipping was killer. The 2 stars are for Amazon's shipping pages."
2,Zzzzzzz....,"Just finished watching with my girlfriend and felt like we wasted two hours of our lives. The plot moved really slow and was hard to follow at times. Not really a ""horror"" flick. More of a psychological drama that takes itself too seriously and fails miserably."
4,Great customer service--but note that this only includes one shoe!,"This product is exactly as described--except that it wasn't totally clear to me that it included only one shoe! Most people are probably not as crazy as I am to have surgery on both feet at once--hence this only coming as a single shoe--but since you always order shoes in pairs, I assumed this one included two as well. Whoops! Hope this helps prevent someone else from making the same mistake. Otherwise--it seems to run true to size, it has adjustable velcro straps to ensure a good fit, it's comfortable and just what the doctor ordered after bunion surgery.The customer service was FANTASTIC. I was in quite a pinch when I realized I only had one shoe, yet two post-op feet! I contacted the company right away, and they were extremely accommodating and rushed another shoe to me. Hugely helpful!!"
2,Not true to size,I ordered this shoe to wear post toe fusion surgery and normally wear a size 9.My toe was sticking out at the end of the shoe so not protected well and the sole was not long enough.I cannot see anyone who is a size 10 wearing this.The sole was not too thick so my foot was a bit sensitive having just come out of a CAM walker.It was very inexpensive so is could be why.I ended up buying a more expensive option in the end
2,Upper storage??,"this product is ok,..you can't fit much on it, it does add minimal overhead storage,you cannot fit a cooler/chairs/..I havn't found anything that it is useful for."
1,Doesn't work for an 10X12 Suncast shed!,"I was so excited to receive the shelf as it would give us the storage need so needed. Now, I don't even though what to do with it but throw it away. It said that it fit all Suncast sheds, but it doesn't. The brackets that it comes with to hold on to the trusses won't fit in. I'm very dissapointed."
3,Not the best beginner book,"I purchased this book for my husband and he has made 3-4 recipes out of it. There aren't very many recipes for an electric dehydrator, but we have had success converting the recipes for other drying methods. The recipes so far have all been super salty. Also many of them are for 10lbs of meat or more so we have had to cut recipes in half. It also has a lot of 'exotic' jerky like fish and fowl.For a beginner this book probably isn't going to be quite what you are looking for. There is some good info in here, and some recipes that sound great, so if you have some experience with jerky I think it would be worth checking out."
3,Jerky,"This book has a variety of recipes many of which I will never use. The few I did use are excellent. The author spent alot of time on the devolopment of beef jerky which I did not need. I was actually looking for a book with recipes for beef jerky not fish,venison, etc. etc."
1,I'd not recommend to buy this book.,Alligator jerky? Huh? Goat jerky? Who will make alligator or goat jerky? I found very few good jerky recipes that you can find online for free. I'd not recommend to buy this book.
2,Came with holes,"I have purchased this product twice now. The first one was a gift from family. We used it once and it was amazing, very sturdy, tons of fun. The wind blew it up against the fence when it was airing out however and tore it. The 2nd one I purchased came with several holes in it. The patches did not work. Very disappointed. Also a side note on this product: When the sun shines at it, it will burn the grass where it reflects at the ground."
1,Poorly Constructed,"I bought this pool last week and am now back to buy another pool because this one is a total waste of money. We put the pool on our deck, which obviously is not level enough for this pool, because even there's only about a 2-inch slope, it's enough to warp the shape of the pool and eventually cause the water to leak out one side. It seems very flimsy, and I wonder if it could even stay together to hold all that water if it was on level ground. Plus, when is ground ever totally level? The kids loved the idea and are very disappointed."
3,"Cute, but deflates","We love the fact that this pool is clear sided, you can easily see what is going on inside from the outside. It is also big enough for an adult to sit inside quite comfortably with a few kids playing. Having an inflatable bottom is nice also, makes it more comfortable to walk and jump around in the pool. The only drawback to that is that little ones can lose their footing more easily on the uneven surface. The biggest problem we have is that it doesn't hold air like it did when we first received the pool, it used to go for days before needing to have some more air put in, now it starts to deflate within hours and we cannot find where the air is leaking from no matter how hard we try. Overall it is a nice pool, maybe a little overpriced for what it is though."
4,Great Buy,"Such a good price for the items you get, I am very pleased with the product. These inks do run out pretty fast that is the only drawback, you can get around 30 pictures or so. But still a great buy compared to purchasing the ink individually."
3,Gets the job done on the cheap.,"I bought this used for a friend here for 79.99. I would not get this unit new for its going street price of 149.99. Its got access to a lot of different sounds but each of those sounds isn't exactly too adjustable. Good for getting yourself into effects for the first time, but I wouldn't consider it for live serious gigging."
4,Good Starter Equipment,"This processor was great when I first started out. Gave me great tones. I had a couple issues where with certain effects I couldn't get the expression pedal to work its magic, but on other sounds it worked perfectly. Don't know if that was in the programming or if my was slightly defective. I wound up reselling mine to get multiple pedals so I could get the specific sounds I needed quicker. Dont get me wrong this processor has the function to easily switch between presets, but I had gotten to the point where it just couldn't keep up with me. Great tool for getting started nontheless."
1,A big disappointment,My storage unit became a disappointment while I was putting it together. The sides snapped together just fine. But the top and bottom didn't line up with the side pieces. It looked like either the parts of two different models were mixed up or that some parts from a previous version were mixed with the new. I noticed other reviews that turned out fine and I'm glad for them! But some reviews had tops that wouldn't close and gaps in the box. I suspect they had the same problem as I did. Amazon is happy to take it back for a full refund. Now I have to get the pieces back into the box and lug it to UPS. I recommend you go to another manufacturer. Don't take the chance you'll get the bad box!
4,Cushion Box,Product was easy to assemble but not as sturdy as I'd hoped. It gets the job done. Built-in rollers would have been good as they are difficult to retrofit.
1,Expensive crap,"It took all of my 200 lbs. to ""snap"" together and after all that the lid didn't seal properly. So much for weather proof, took it back to store, Lucky for them I have a truck or would have dragged it back tied to bumper. Not worth the price or time;poor quality."
3,"nice size, Quality Less than expected...","It arrived in ""record"" time, however, the box had been dropped and a corner of the top was chipped..The assembly was not for a ""lite weight"" as their idea of ""gentle pressure"" to snap in place required more than I could muster. So I paid a handyman to ""snap it in"". He seemed to have no problem. It looks very nice and has ample (lots) of room inside, but plastic/resin could be more substantial in my opinion. I guess, beware instructions that sound ""too simple"".."
5,Great item!,"Suncast DB5000 50-Gallon Deck BoxSuncast GH1732 Outdoor Trash HideawaySuncast SSW1000 Winter Storage Box For Ice Melt/Sand/Salt Snow De-IcersI got these to hold outdoor cat food, trash, and patio furniture seat cushions. They are perfect for those uses. The neutral beige color goes well with my patio furniture. Assembly was easy, kind of like big Legos. I would recommend these."
4,Good product but damaged,I have several (7 with this latest purchase) suncast deck boxes on our patio so I truly like the product which in the past I have always purchased at Target. My last purchase of this Suncast DB9750 Extended Deck Box (now my second one of this size) was damaged on the front panel right out of the box. There was no damage to the box in the area of the panel damage so it most likely was packaged with the damage. It should never have been boxed. But it did not impact functionality- only looks. If I bought it at the store and wasn't pressed for time I would have returned it for replacement. Again great product and easy to put together.
4,serves the purpose,Easily holds 6 full chair cushions and could hold more. Removable tray I use for sunscreen and insect repellent. I'm reasonably pleased with the product. Didn't take long to assemble but the lid isn't perfectly in line with the box which bothers me somewhat but this hasn't caused any issues and isn't noticeable. This box sits outdoors in an unprotected area. We have had some really strong storms and heavy rains and I could only find a few drops of water inside. (presumably due to the lid) My cushions did not get wet.
2,Cheap construction,"Basic plastic like box after you put it together. Pretty flimsy. Lid doesn't fit snuggly. Hence,not watertight. Can't win them all."
2,Product broke in shipment,"One of the clasps connect the top to the base broke in shipment. We had to superglue it back together. Would have returned it but its just too big. The box itself is a good size, and we can fit everything in there. Disappointed with having to repair it before we even opened it though."
1,TOP DOES NOT FIT,THE BOX HAS A SPOT FOR A LOCK. TO BAD THE TOP DOES NOT. ON THE BOX THERE ARE SPOTS FOR THE TOP TO BE HELD SHUT WHEN CLOSED. NOTHING ON THE TOP TO FIT INTO THESE SPOTS. IT LOOKS LIKE THE TOP IS NOT MADE FOR THIS BOX. I WILL HAVE TO MAKE SOMETHING TO HOLD THE TOP CLOSED.
2,Top Does Not Fit Correctly,"When not in use, we hold the top in place with a small cement block. To call this box weather resistant is a stretch even if the top fit correctly. It has three ""designed in"" openings where water from a storm can enter. Two are where the top hinges in back and one is in front.This box is the right size -- but as I discovered after this purchase, there are better boxes for less out there."
2,good size... poor quality,"As others before me have said the size of this product is great! My sister and I purchased this for my dad for his birthday in December and during the winter we stored my son's toys in it. My son is six and was not rough with the box, just simply opened and closed it to get his toys out and one of the hinges snapped right off less than two weeks after buying it. I agree with the others that the lid does not fit properly and there is no way to lock it. We have only had it outside for about a week now so I cannot say wether it is waterproof or not but the design is poorly done. We have all sat on it and it is strong enough but not very sturdy since it is missing a hinge on the back. Needless to say we were all a little disappointed."
2,Suncast review,"The product is flimsy and not waterproof, does not snap closed and looks like it will not last......I am very disappointed!!"
4,Simple storage,"I received this product and within 15 minutes I had it together using no tools, I put my patio chair pads inside along with an outdoor extension chord and BBQ tools. We also use it to sit serving dishes on. Wow, what a deal."
5,Super Storage,"I was searching for an outside storage box for my patio chairs. This box had the right measurements, so I ordered it. It arrived within 2 days! It was very lightweight enough for me to get it to my backyard by myself, easy to assemble and set in place. It is the exact size that I wanted and works perfectly."
5,Suncase deck box great for storage,"Length:: 1:30 MinsI've been using the Suncast Deck Box for about three years, and have had great results. Check out the video for details."
2,Read reviews and bought it anyway. Mistake!,"Well I read the other reviews and chose to buy it anyway. It is a very large box that is what I was looking for to hold my childrens play things but the quality just isn't there. It is very flimsy as most reviews said. I snapped off a piece of plastic first thing trying to attach the lid so now the lid doesn't close well at all. That was a concern in some of the other reviews about how secure the lid was. It definitely doesn't help when you snap a piece off of the hinge.So, if you buy this box, just make sure you are careful snapping it all together. It is a very large box though."
3,Not good for windy and rainy area,Lid doesn't shut tightly so on windy days the rain gets the items wet inside and when it arrived one of the hinges for the lid was broke. Too much of a pain to return so I am just dealing with it. Even if the hinge was not broke the lid still would not have a tight fit.
4,Purchase of deck storage chest,"I purchased the product and was surprised at it's size. Very large. Easy to put together--no tools. However, I wouldn'trecommend anyone attempting to use this as a bench unless you would like to wind up on America's Funniest Home Videos. I don't think that would be wise as it's just not made from material that would accommodate very much weight. But it is good for the purpose I bought it for --storage of back yard deck equipment and yard tools."
4,Could be stronger but for the price it is nice,"I got this to store my patio cushions, it is huge and has great capacity. However, it is a little flimsy. Does not close very well but suits what I needed for the price."
3,"Perfect size, easy install but product could be stronger","Easy to install and I was able to jam it pack with cushions of varying sizes, umbrellas, and miscellaneous items. The only problem was that it came with a couple pieces broken right out the box..but luckily it did not impact the performance."
2,Broken Already!!,"I use this item as a storage unit and a bench, just as it was designed. We no longer have kids at home, so no one is playing with it or in it (!) -- just my husband and I removing and replacing outdoor living items. Our friends sometimes sit on it when there's a crowd on our deck. We've had it one complete year, beginning our second summer when we use it more often, and the hinge on the lid is broken completely off! In retrospect, the hinge is very wimpy and there are only two of them on the back. Very disappointed, and have asked Amazon to ""make good"" on this purchase!"
4,Great looking curls,"It's a great conditioner. Expensive, but great. It makes my hair feel soft and look shiny. I haven't found that it weighs my curls down, either."
2,Not Recommended,"I tried this as a ""healthy"" alternative to liquid foundations, previously pressed powder foundations and thick liquid ones weren't good for my skin. This one was too watery, providing me very, very little coverage. The good side, it always felt invisible (probably because it really wasn't there). Goes on easy but, again, it's like tinted water without the noticeable tint. Eventually after prolonged use this began to irritate my skin and caused what had to have been an allergic reaction (the bumps were quite awful). I would not try this product again."
5,Good Book to explore Scientific miracles as shown in the Quran,Very informative and easy to read. Good for non-muslims to see how the Quran discusses scientific miracles.The author La'li has a unique voice and is able to make the content interesting. I personally enjoyed reading the book very much.
4,A Comprehensive Exploration of the Scientific Miracles in Ho,a Very good book to explore by non muslims.... a lot of scientific proofs exposed in a comprehensive expose... a lire absolument!!!
5,brilliant-this book frames punk and pop music beautifully,"Long John (the lst reviewer of this book) hit the nail on the head. Marcus was a big part of my life in the 80's at the time I was in college. While I could go on about how wonderful this book is, the bottom line is, if you love music and challenging ideas, this is a must read. Highly recommended."
3,culterly/cutting board,"arrived in good condition and on time , very pleased with the price of the set I haven't had a chance to use all of the knives but what I have used they cut very well"
4,Ok,It is what it is what else can you say. You can't use it for everyday use but you can have it as a traveling set. Which I'm using it for
3,Best Math Review,"Well of all the gre books i've studied i think this book has the best math review section of all with pretty good excercise questions help you calculate faster and develop different type of skills needed for the math section in gre. I don't like the CATs given in this book which are in CDROM due to 2 reasons. Firstly their scoring system and the division of questions of different kind of skills and then the range it predicted was'nt right too. I've taken the CAT in it on the last day before my GRE exam and it predicted V=660-700, Q=710-750, A=660-700 and in the real one the next day i got V=560, Q=790, A=790. So don't depend upon its predictions about you. Any how I got this book only for the Math review which paid dividends for me."
2,There are better study guides out there...,"ARCO's GRE study guide is fairly cheap, but there are much better guides out there (KAPLANS or the PRINCETON REVIEW). The book itself is ""verbose,"" to say the least, and the tips are not really tips at all. Who really has time to sift through 500 pages of stuff? The only redeeming aspect of the guide is it's vocabulary list, which, compared with the other guides, is really lacking. I'd invest my money in something else. If anything, you can make a great door prop with it..."
5,fantastic single!,"'your kisses are wasted on me' is everything you want in pop song: ridiculously cute vocalists, smart lyrics, crisp production, the backup vocal 'boy,' and the impossibly catchy chorus.coming in at a succint 2:15, 'your kisses are wasted on me' is a throwback to phil spector's 60s girl groups. it's a brave move on their part, especially given today's market for overly-produced, manufactured pop. however, a great hook is still a great hook and 'your kisses are wasted on me' has hooks ad naseum. it's a fun, rousing, melodic, fists-in-the-air, quasi-feminist anthem with some nicely venemous lyrics ('boy, can't you see we're through? boy, i don't love you, you don't make me smile for awhile). sure, it falls a bit on the side of kitsch, but it's apparent the pipettes love what they do--the ladies embue 'your kisses are wasted on me' with verve, style and fun.so throw on a mini skirt, some go-go boots, silver eye shadow and dance all night."
3,And the truth shall set you free,"I think this book is very helpful tome and others out there, if you read between the lines you will find a lot of truth in what he says about the world and the ""Evil Empire"" and abouttrue facts that's really going on and we have people (critics that know the truth) and refuse to tell it, David Icke tells the truth."
2,Reaching,"I can buy into some of what he writes (proven document and solid source). He reaches and reaches and reaches, however. David Icke is clearly a paranoid schizophrenic. I agree that we may not get the straight dope, and the media is most definitely slanted - but most of this book is very hard to swallow and his sources for the most part are unreliable at least and usually unverifiable."
1,New nonesense from a man protecting the world from sleestak,"David icke, a man who thinks the queen of endland is lizard alien and that space is turquise is now going on about this delusions about the world trade center. Offering not a ounce of evidence, Mr. icke goes on about how the us goverment was involved and how the towers MUST have been destroyed by explosives. I can imagine that anybody could take these bad x-files episode ideas as fact, but don't underestimate the gullibity of the average human. ZERO STARS, david ecke should be ashamed of the garbage he puts out."
3,best taken with grains of salt,"Icke does a good job covering the facts surrounding the WTC tragedy. The questions he asks to tear the official story apart are so obvious, that I had to ask myself what was thinking not asking them initially. It also shows how easy it is for the powers that be to fool the apathetic general public. the reason I don't give this four stars is that there are a number of very important leads that Icke never follows up on(the revelation that Bin Laden has been dead for years) and/or revelations he sources through unnamed insiders(the pentagon has a missile defense system like the one the Australian parliament has). Not all the information is credible, however the stuff that is well worth the price tag."
5,THE BEST CONSPIRACY RESEARCHER IN THE WORLD DOES IT AGAIN!,"david icke, the best conspiracy researcher does it again with his incredible breakdown of the outlandish lies and deception that have plagued us for so long. he gives the reasons why 9/11 happened, who was really responsible, and how we can stop them. he also destroys the official story and shows the many contradictions and inaccuracies that followed the 9/11 tragedy. i HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK to those who are seeking the truth and who aren't satisfied with the fairy tales our government has told us. we will win this they can't stop truth and love from coming together it's inevitable."
1,Lizards,"The author of this book is an ex English soccer player and sports commentator who had a nervous breakdown and went, well...nuts. He belives, for example, that the UK royal family are really lizards wearing disguises. Seriously, this is true..check it out. If you use this as a bench mark I think you can gauge how accurate his writings on 9/11 will be. This is not to say that there are not questions over 9/11, but this author is not going to cast any light on them. In the UK he is seen as just a nut and nobody really takes him seriously, so I dont think people across the pond should either."
1,"Sad comment on a sick, delusional mind","David icke, the man who once claimed he was the sun of god and the color turquise protected him and thinks the queen of england is a sleestak from the land of the lost is now using the horrible events in New york and washington to further his conspiritoral delusions. Yes, david the towers where blown up with explosives that why the member of the building start to bend INWARD when the south tower collapse on video. Maybe the reptiliods uses big MAGNETS to collapse the towers. David icke is unable to unstand basic logic and reasoning and fills in the vast gaps of his understanding with bizarre incoherent new age nonsense. This book disgusts me!"
1,Should have zero stars,"In the immortal words of Blackadder this book has only one thing to recommend it, ""Soft and very absorbent"". So use your brain and hang it on a hook in the toilet. Read it page by page and then put it to better use.David Icke really did his brain some damage at some point in his life, this is further proof."
1,I couldn't believe my eyes,"Let me see if I get this strait..Our own government planned the 9/11 attacks? Our President George W. Bush allowed the slaughter of over 3000 people for political reasons?Yeah right.That makes a lot of...Let's kill our own people, destroy our economy for a very long time, make flying a nightmare for what seems like forever and make Americans afarid of things like a unattended bag at an airport or a parked truck at the Lincoln Tunnel.Oh yeah, that fits."
3,Less disinfo this time from Icke,"You get a lot of good solid verifiable stuff on the neo-cons, 9/11 and the new world order in this book. There is less disinformation in this than anything else Icke has wrote and even the disinfo has some truth interwoven into it this time. Regardless I still have a hard time trusting Icke.Alice in Wonderland is worth reading if you can borrow it from the library but when you consider there are multitudes of better books on 9/11 and exposing the new world order plus the very high price they are asking for this book I wouldn't recomend it buying it."
1,I just want to know what the record label was thinking...,"First of all, I want to say that I'm a HUGE Simple Minds fan since the mid-80's. I have all their albums and the ""Seen The Lights: A Visual History"" double-DVD set. With that said, the one star isn't for the ""Live In Verona"" set. You see, it's already part of the ""Visual History"" set. ""Live In Verona"" is a WONDERFUL concert set live in Sept. 1989 in Verona, Italy. The band's performance is stunning, stellar, and dynamic to say the least. The one star is for the record label's thinking of releasing ""Live In Verona"" when it's already part of the ""Visual History"" set! For those of you that don't know, the additional disc of ""Visual History"" contains all the band's music videos and then some! You're much better off buying ""Visual History"" in my humble opinion!"
2,I didn't care for this video,"I didn't think this video was very good. Sorry, but not a fan of it. The original songs are much better the way they were first released."
2,"Good group, poor quality video",This is one of my favorite 80's bands. There's not much out there in video form so I was anxious to see this. One of my pet peeves in a video are the rapid fire shots of the musicians and audience. This concert footage will give you a migraine 15 minutes into it. The audio is barely passable also. It's a shame: such a good group with such poor editing. Anybody want it?
5,Farber Brothers Krome Kraft Collectors Book,"This is a very detailed concise book. The many colored photographs show the beauty of the Krome Kraft product. The product descriptions contain precise details as to known colors, labels, deminsions, and time periods, with suggested values. I had trepitations in purchasing a collectors book on line - I am 100% happy I did."
3,non-standard key placement is a problem,"The arrow keys are placed in what looks like a logical order, but doesn't match other keyboards and so I am always hitting them incorrectly.The block of six keys on the upper right (left of the number pad -- insert, delete, page up, page down) are oriented vertically, rather than horizontally (3 rows of 2, rather than 2 rows of 3) and the ""insert"" key is placed below (bottom right) the ""page up"" and ""page down"" keys, whereas on most keyboards it is upper left. You can imagine what problems this creates.There are other similar design issues.The keyboard is good quality, but the non-standard configuration is a source of constant frustration, since it is so different from the keyboards I use at work and with my laptop."
3,Alright keyboard,"Well, the keyboard is a dark olive drab, not black like the description says. I don't really care too much about the color though. I like the natural keyboard layout, I just wish they had made it a little wider between the keyboard and the numpad so that they could have kept the traditional layout for the cursor keys. The way they are set up is kind of annoying. It's not bad enough that I want to give it back, just minor really. If I used those keys more often, maybe I'd be a little more upset. Now, enough of the negatives. The keyboard feels like it's well built, and the keys seem to give just enough resistance. I get so sick of all those soft touch keyboards out there that make you feel like you're tapping your fingers on a pillow they are so soft. This keyboard actually feels good to type on. Well, that's pretty much all I have to say about that."
4,Good keyboard for all finger-things!,"This keyboard has a nice touch, is firm and hard to dislodge, seems very clean and has nice media and browser buttons. For the price, it does all I want. Any more costly and I would expect it to wash my dishes, too. A good value, I bought one for myself and another for the wife once I saw how nice it was."
4,Split Keyboard,"Item works well, was perfect for my tendinitis, able to use with other computers and I take it with me to the office."
2,Space bar stuck,"I quickly got used to the design of this keyboard, adding a separate gel wrist wrest to the hard plastic built-in wrist rest for comfort. The problem was that the right space bar stuck, causing runaway spacing in any document I was working in. I had to return it."
4,not as good as the original microsoft split design keyboard,"I bought this keyboard because I spilled hot water on my microsoft split keyboard (which i bought on amazon in November 2011). However, that keyboard is now out of stock and is not produced by Microsoft anymore. Hence, this Fellowes keyboard was the closest replacement. Most features - the shape and style - fits my use well. The only complaint is the arrow keys - even after 1 month of using it, I still find myself hitting the wrong arrow key.There is not much competition for this type of keyboard hence it's a default choice."
1,"Keys stuck, returned","I use the Microsoft Ergonomic 4000 but need to replace it since it's worn out, so tried this one. It felt comfortable enough, similar to the MSFT keyboard, but the keys stuck. Pressed space bar, for example, and it stayed depressed...returned it. Going to stick with MSFT...it's loud, but it works."
3,Really comfortable design. G and H keys died after very heavy use.,"Despite the G and H keys dieing after two and a half weeks of use, I just can't bring myself to rate it any lower.After writing probably 35 thousand to 40 thousand words on it day and night for NaNoWriMo, and my wrists didn't hurt at all using it, three stars feels fair.I think it would have lasted about a year under normal use."
3,Be aware this is not wireless.,"I purchased this after clicking on the description that came up when I searched for ""wireless ergonomic keyboard"" (or maybe it was ""ergonomic wireless keyboard""...whatever). Nowhere in the pictures does it show a cable extending from it and nowhere in the description does it say whether it is wired or wireless. So I assumed it was wireless. I was very surprised to discover a cable dangling from it when I unpacked it. I did keep it because my husband has been complaining about the lousy keyboard that came with his Dell a couple of summers ago. (And don't get me started on THAT experience.) I've been trying to get him to try an ergonomic keyboard and it appears that so far he likes it."
4,USB split keyboard,"this is a true split keyboard as i love. it could maybe use some more special features on top, such as a back button. these are getting hard to find and i'm thinking about buying another to keep in stock. works fine; i've had it out in my garage full of dirt and ashes for a while now with no problems."
5,great Keyboard,i was a horrible typer with the Microsoft split i came across as almost illiterate with this keyboard my typos droppped like 98% i wouldnt have thought that a different shape of the keys ans a better key action could make such a differenceI will never go back to a cheapo keyboard again
4,"Hate the cord, love the keyboard","I had a similar keyboard from logitech and it kept breaking (I bought 4 or 5 of them before I gave up on the company). I found this much cheaper but it's not cordless. If you can live with a corded keyboard, this is SO much more ergonomic. Once you've dealt with this keyboard (there is a bit of a learning curve with having your shoulders, arms and hands how they actually come off of your body rather than forcing them into a weird posture that other keyboards do), you'll never go back. Being asked to go back may make you ANGRY and you may carry one of these in your car just in case you use someone else's computer and can't deal with the shoulder and wrist strain. A quality product for the price and ergonomic is so much more important than you'd think. I mean, you DO have to live in your body ALL of the time. Don't strain it to use a stupid keyboard!"
4,Great for people with wrist issues,"Replaced a standard keyboard with this one. Having carpal tunnel issues, this has made a difference in how my hands feel after typing. The placement of your hands while typing is much more comfortable. It does take a bit of getting use to but is worth the learning curve in exchange for the comfortable positioning of your hands."
5,Wish I always had this type of keyboard,"I had never used an ergonomic keyboard before this one, but it was surprisingly easy to start typing on right away without feeling like I needed to ""adjust."" I am at attorney and spend a lot of time in front of the computer typing out documents and I always noticed that my wrists would start to hurt, but using this keyboard, I have yet to experience that problem again. I also used to get pain in my shoulder towards the end of the day when I did a lot of typing and finally traced it to the type of keyboard I was using. Since using this Fellowes one, I haven't had that shoulder pain either.Overall, I am very glad I purchased this keyboard. I only wish I could get the same typing style on my laptop!"
4,Good For People Who Type A Lot,"I use this for copywriting and blogging. The keys are almost as hard to press as the Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite A11-00337Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite, which can be good or bad depending on preference. The tactile response is similar, and fast typists will appreciate it. However, if you don't need the bonus keys or antimicrobial coating, get the Microsoft Natural Elite, which also comes in black. You get a smaller footprint, and it costs less."
2,"too big, bulky, split design feels awkward","Unfortunately I had to send back this keyboard, because it was too big, bulky, and awkward to use.I could not get used to the split design, however for people who type very fast all day long with ten digits it may work really well.I am essentially a two-finger typer, and the cost for this keyboard was simply not worth it to me.Also for that price I expected wireless, but to my surprise it is corded.The so called ergonomic design did not relieve my carpal tunnel at all, I am disappointed.That said, there is technically nothing wrong with the keyboard, it seems to be well constructed."
2,I won't be buying another one of these,mehThat's all I can say about this keyboard. The action is a bit stiff and as a 'semi' touch typist (meaning I need to look down more often than not) I've found that I miss more keystrokes because of the harder action than most other keyboards.I had this keyboard for almost 6 months now and use it at home and the letters are already beginning to rub off. Whereas the microsoft keyboard I've had at work for the last 2 years and use 8 - 10 hours a day is in relatively the same condition.I would skip this keyboard and stick with theMicrosoft Natural Ergo Keyboard 4000if you want a split keyboard.
2,"Not cordless, picture is deceiving","I bought this keyboard thinking it was cordless because it looks that way in the picture. I was very disapointed when it came, cord attached. I guess I should read the descrption of things I buy in the future a little more carefully. Needless to say, I am sending this back!"
3,Okay is all I can say,Not my choice but okay for the money I reckon. I really don't have ten more words to express myself.
1,Keys don't work,"Right off the bat, seven of the keys on the right side did not function at all. I sent it back to Amazon. I received no support from Fellowes. They're now officially off my approved vendor list."
2,Not my best puchase,"Tried this keyboard & wasn't happy w/ it at all. The keys were very stiff. I tried using it for awhile thinking maybe it was just because it was new, but it didn't matter. Seemed like I had to go back 2 & 3 times because the key didn't get pushed hard enough. Granted I am used to a laptop keyboard (soft touch is all it takes), however, I don't think after typing for a few hours my fingers should be tired! The keyboard also sat too high for me. You can make it lay flat by not using the back ""feet"" but the curve of the keyboard itself was too much. It also has a substantial rest on the front which cannot be removed as it's attached. This just didn't work for me. I gave the keyboard a ""2"" because I think the Microban is a great idea. Overall, just not comfortable, and far too stiff for me to use."
4,split keyboard by Fellowes,"The funky positioning of the home, end, delete keys make it very easy to delete when you meant end, and the left shift key could be shorter to allow for a longer left ALT key, but other than that it feels fine. I'd buy another one if I needed it. Splitting the space bar is a definite improvement over the Microsoft product, as the single space-bar my keyboard at work tends to stick just when I want to use it in combination with some other control key."
2,Don't buy if you are an Excel hot-key user,"This keyboard is okay. However, I would recommend you not buy a Fellowes product. This was the only split design keyboard offered by my company's office supply vendor, so I am stuck. If you use hot keys to navigate and select cells in MS Excel, you will likely be disappointed with this keyboard. Often the keyboard acts like you have released the control or shift key when you are holding it down to select cells or navigate. This is an annoyance, but it is aggravated by the very poor support offered by Fellowes. In my experience, this brand is bottom of the barrel."
4,I love this keyboard!!!,"I type 12 hours a day with my job, so decided that I needed to try something to help with the stress on my arms and hands. This was very, very easy to adjust to, I've been using it about a month now. I type over 100 wpm and this keyboard keeps up with me without a problem! The only things I dislike is the volume control works only with the main volume control and not my mp3 player, but other then that its wonderful."
3,Decent,"Good book with some interesting combinations, the best part of the book is the DVD that comes with it. It features a 20 minute cardio/strength program that focuses on your core which is challenging. It is an exerpt from the 45 minute DVD sold seperately. It is a good book if you are intermediate to advanced in your fitness levels."
1,"it's not muay thai, people!","you can tell just by looking at Sifu Klein\Mr. Weis's uniform and body position on the cover that he is a kung fu practitioner. He and Mr Lyons might be exemplory kung fu practitioners for all we know, but the fact of the matter is, it's wrong to make a video marketing a style of martial art you obviously know knothing about. Stick to kung fu. Oh, and it also seems wrong to give 2 five-star reviews in a video that you starred in ""Mr. Weiss."""
3,good source of inspiration,"'Gardeners Gifts' is a (nice handy softcover) book worthwhile pouring over for some sparks of inspiration before summer starts. The photographs are inviting to the eye. The 'but', and there is a 'but', is that some of the ideas presented in the book seem a bit silly and amateurish eg. painting flowers on a pair of wellingtons but the book is by far dominated by original and beautiful arrangements eg. lavender 'bottles', herbs in a basket with homemade tags, rose petal jam, gardeners scarf with pocket for insect-repellent oil. Lots of great gift ideas for fellow gardeners. The text-photo ratio is well balanced. I think I have been through a good deal books within this topic and this one is worth buying."
3,Disturbing and distressing,"First off, I don't see this as a slasher film. I found it to be more of a psychological/horror movie about the beginnings of a serial killer. I may add that the director was successful or I just got hooked in with the characters that towards the end, I did feel distressed and disturbed of the outcome of the characters, even the drunken invalid father calling out for his son and waiting by his front door unbeknownst that his (heroic)son will never come home and the survival of the little girl's dog spared by both the horrific demise of its owners and the flame furied fall of its home. I loved seeing Michael Biehn as a family man and John Savage as the invalid father. I find it hard, but surprised, to see child actors perform and be in a movie with a very violent subject matter."
3,it was okay,People who call this a slasher film and gory don't believe it. decent story and a predictable ending but I was expecting a little more horror and scares and it didn't deliver
2,Bereavement movie,I didn't care for this movie at all. It was depressing and poorly done. I didn't even finish watching it to the end. This one I would not recommend
4,A good prequel to Malevolance,"This film is a prequel to the Indie film Malevolence. The director Stephen Mena amped it up by ten times for this one. He finally got a better budget for this film which is good. The film tells about how the killer in Malevolence came to be the killer he is. Which he is a very young boy in this one and the murderer keeps him captive and turns him into a killer like him by brainwashing him and make him live in a house of horrors with him. Malevolence was director Mena's first film so it was cheaply made, but this one is actually a good film."
4,It works for both Win98 and Win2000 but...,"This is one of only two USB enabled CDR/RWs in the market. And this is the only one that come with Win2000 driver. Very compact and protable (size of a portable CD player). It also come with a very nice, full-featured CDBurning/UDF software from Ahead corp.(Germany) -- equal or beter than my Adaptec CDCreator/DirectCD 4.02D. The only issue is that the fail rate is higher on the Win2000. The reason is that USB is not a fast device and it needs CPU to keep it running. But, better than nothing on the Win2k platform for a USB CDR/RW. It works with my notebooks and desktops."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Our Lab also has this toy finished within the 1st hour.Company says they guarantee product but do not respond to emails.BIG WASTE OF MONEY!
1,Certainly NOT an extreme toy!!!,"My 8 month old Lab mix ripped this toy apart in five minutes! This is no exaggeration!!! I was very disappointed with the toy especially since it is titled as extreme and claims to be ""battle tested"". I'm going to attempt to have it replaced as per their guarantee and then I'll give the replacement to my neighbor's Maltese!"
4,Happy and referring another,"my dog is a 18 month old mutt(pitbull-black lab-german shepard-border collie mix)i was spending 40 dollars a month to keep her from ""trying to find the squeaker in my couch"" but once i bought her the bamboo combat man... i spend maybe 40 dollars in 3 months.ive recommended it to one complete stranger at petsmart who had a golden reteiever at his side and what must have been 100$ in plushies. i saw him again the other day when i ran into him buying dogfood. he thanked me and said he too was telling his friends to buy one.my boyfriends co worker is getting a couple for his 3 black lab puppies too"
2,Faulty Parts Sent with Bike,"So I buy this super bike online, right size right style but they send faulty pedals and stems, the road pedals were so poorly manufactured that the screws to attach to the stems had faulty screws and could not be secured.So instead of being able to ride this thing I have to send part of it back and wait another 10 days while these idiots actually send the correct partsSo I try to contact Amazon to return this part of the product and am referred to the manufacturer Cadillac Cycles and get their run around,VERY POOR service for customers"
1,Inadequate Sound Dampening Desgin with Ugly Sprinkled on Top,"I was very interested on ways to keep my license plate from rattling, sadly this Dynamat 19100 License Plate Kit didn't make the cut. Looking past the absolutely disgusting appearance of the actual license plate, the sound dampening design to quite the license plate is just awful. I'm was not pleased with this purchase, but I guess that's what you get for $10.Bottom Line.. use a different avenue on how to damper your obnoxious rattling license plate."
2,Why advertise you may have expensive equipment in your trunk?,"Im all about sound systems. Ive been an audiophile since before I put the key in my first car. Coming from someone who has invested countless hours and dollars in car audio the only thing I can say about this product is that wether or not you have a giant system in your trunk, why would you want to advertise that you MAY have one? The only thing I see coming from this is someone seeing the Dynamat logo and the ""I have better sound"" slogan and thinking hmm Im going to break into this car. I have about a grand worth of equipment in the trunk of my Chrysler 300, and I don't want anyone to know that when the car is off and parked. You would be better off buying a roll of 20 feet of stick on insulation at Home Depot for $20 and doing the entire back of the license plate AND the inside of the trunk lid at the same time like I have done on the past three cars I have owned. Hope this helps!"
2,Need bigger,"Product is great but need more of it, still rattled the plate number, better off getting others for the price like audio technix"
4,'Tis Blue,"I was expecting something a bit more like the blueberry soda found in Maine and that's nothing like this. I'm a fan of sparkling fruit juice, though, so sparkling blueberry juice was interesting."
4,Great Strength / Fitness Training System,"I was looking for some kind of easy-to-use fitness system for my basement and of course I did my normal 5 days of internet research for hours on end. Somehow I found this item and am really glad I did.Great features are: Easy of use, wide variety of excercises, no free weights or power rods to worry about my toddler's hands to get caught in. The resistance system is completely self contained, so you just dial the weight, the sets and the reps and you go. Just a great concept.I really got a bargain on Amazon b/c it was in stock for only $500 shipped. Many places were twice the price.I would have given it 5 stars, but the control panel didn't come attached to the housing, which is a mistake. So I had to spend an hour fixing that. All in all, it was only 2 hours to assemble which wasn't bad at all since I did it myself.[...]"
5,A Great Read!,"'Where Birds Don't Sing', the second book in Alan Clegg's trilogy is fantastic. The book is well-plotted and could be read as a stand-alone story but as it includes characters from 'Windmills' I would recommend that you read them in order if you can. Although this story is the second in the Dutch Holocaust triology and will appeal to readers interested in this subject matter it is also on a par with some of the best psychological thrillers I have read. The way in which the story moves from the present day to the past can sometimes be confusing but Alan Clegg has done a great job with it. It is gripping from start to finish and kept me intrigued all the way through - I can't wait to read the third book in the series. I recommend this book to you without any hesitation."
5,This is a must have!,This book so clearly explains how to step back and really experience the peace of attending the temple. S. Michael Wilcox preserves the sacredness of the experience. His stories and insights are appropriate and thought provoking. It is a wonderful book for anyone who holds a recomend or desires to understand the personal imporance to any faithful Latter-day Saint the temple experience holds.
3,Motivating,"Motivating, but not as deep and insightful as I expected from the table of contents and reviews. ""Endowed from on high....."" is thought provoking."
1,"Not that good. Go with FatMat brand, it is way better and less expensive","This brand is very expensive and it really does not perform as it's much less expensive and better quality competitor, FatMat. The adhesive was not even really sticky and the vibration damping was any good either. Thank God I got this small bad small taste of this Dynamant Extreme, because is not good at all and it's the most expensive of all the sound deadning brands. Go with FatMat, it's much better and less expensive"
3,"It works, but does not fulfull the promise of *Eliminate Distortion*","Installation was very easy, just peel and stick. I could definitely see an improvement in bass, sound quality, and I also noticed that the rattles around the speakers have disappeared. Unfortunately there was still a lot of rattling throughout the door, and distortion seemed to be there on high volumes still on my Alpine speakers.Overall, this was a decent buy. It may be difficult to install for those who have no idea how to take out the door panel. The price is quite nice though, for those who are iffy on the whole Dynamat scheme."
1,Save your money,"I started with the speaker packs. I saw very little result. Then dynamat said, well you really need to do the whole door, so I did. $400 later, I still have as much road noise as before and I covered my entire door frame on all 4 doors.Don't buy in to the hype."
4,"Good stuff, overpriced","I used some of this on my headphones to help deaden the bass. It works very well, but then I found out there is cheaper stuff available. So I would shop around before getting this, but it does work very well."
2,APPLY COMMON SENSE,"When looking at these products, simply calculate the actual cost per square foot. for example this""speaker kit"" contains 1.38 square feet, for around 22 bucks(price fluxuates like its a stock or something?)can u think of anything thats worth 15 dollars a square foot? there are so many cheaper alternatives. dynamat is an awsome product, and it does work. but for those of us not made of money, search this ""butyl flashing tape"" u will be glad u did."
3,Small and well made but difficult to store,"I am pleased with this except that the brush is difficult to get into the tube. It consists of three pieces: the tube, the brush and a connecting ring that is threaded on one side to fit the tube and on the other side to accept the threads of the back of the brush. It is hard to get the brush into the tube with the bristles toward the closed end. This would allow one to seal the whole thing except for a drainage hole in the base of the tube. The easier alternative is to put the brush butt end into the tube and cap it with the connecting ring. Some of the bristle ends are then slightly exposed. I would like to avoid crushing the bristle ends. I'll try wrapping some wax paper around the bristles tightly and see if I can slide it into the tube. It would have been nice if the bottom of the tube were removable so the brush could just slide through."
3,Not the best,"The price was certainly right for this shaving brush, however, in some respect, you get what you pay for. The hairs are too long and are not firm enough as a result. Moreover, because the hairs are not held high enough up the hair and are left too long, the brush has gotten very soft and splayed out (loose) after only a few months despite proper care. I would recommend trying to find a brush where the hairs are held higher up resulting in shorter overall hair length and a stiffer, more effective, longer lasting brush."
4,Complete system,Complete text of traditional art by authoratative author. Excellent reference of techniques. Chinese author has slight problem with english in this translation. Does not delineate when or where to use techniques. Must learn Chin-na with instructor to learn this.
5,Study Judo,"This was a gift for my son, who had wrestled in H.S. and had also enjoyed learning Judo from a really great local instructor. Out of it for some years, he was interested in this book by Judo's founder. He is very pleased with the content."
4,A comprehensive reference,"Although this book is a comprehensive reference (which is the intent) it doesn't make much mention of training techniques, gripping, combinations or transition. If you want a reference text to find out what ashi guruma is, or what the next technique in the nage-no kata is, this is an excellent book. If, however, your problem is what to do to set up an opponent for harai goshi, this book will not help much. It is still an excellent reference and the introductory passages by Kano are worth reading."
5,The Bible of Judo,This book is the bible of Judo. Even the older publications that aren't up to date are worth owning by anyone interested in Martial Arts and especially by those studying Judo.
4,Good-enough,"This was a good buy. No worries, and came at the time frame stated. I have other Judo books, but this one gives the best step-by-step pictures and commentary. It helped me pass my final with an ""A""."
4,I very good book,"This is an excellent book. It by definition being a book from Kano automatically makes it ""true"". You will find some of the pictures to be inconsistent with the write-up.I have found that most martial arts schools that teach Kodokan Judo have stylized it some so you may find some more inconsistency from teaching to book application.Overall it is a great book that explains it well I have not found a better book.Bernie Zanoni[...]"
5,The Bible Of Judo,"As stated above, this book is considered the foundation of Judo, both modern day and early judo. Please be aware that this book is not to purchased and read as a novel: it is to supplement judo training in the dojo and assist with one's desire to achieve success in the sport of judo."
5,Definetly the BEST book on the subject of Judo,"This is definetly the bible of Judo. Written by the founder himself Dr. Jigoro Kano Shihan. I have read the book word for word five times since I have owned it, and learn something new each time. Being the head instructor for the Eastpointe Judo-Jujitsu Club in Eastpointe, Michigan I make it manitory for my students to purchase the book."
5,A must have!,"If you want to learn Judo, this is your book!If you think you know a lot about Judo, this book is for you!It has lots of photos and, best of all, covers the Judo's history and etic's.I have 5 books of Judo and this is the best one!"
4,Great frizz control,"This is a great product to control my frizzes without weighing my hair down. I have wavy-curly hair that tends to either frizz or go limp depending on the product... this cream has been a happy medium for me. I combine it with a bit of serum and scrunch, and presto! Well controlled waves, even in 90% humidity."
4,The author is trust worthy,"I have not and probably won't be available for awhile to read & study this material due to a large amount of book purchases & study I'm doing.I purchased this book because i own making peace with your past by this same author.The other book is super,i trusted that i wouldn't go wrong & didn't want to pass this book up.I believe it's well worth the investment as the other book.I hope this was helpful!"
1,DIE INJECTION,This product is over priced and poorly built after several application the lowside valve fell apart and buy another low side valve would recommend this product
5,Wonderful Crochet Hook - Highly Recommended,"I purchased a few of the Clover bamboo crochet hooks when learning how to crochet. First, they are so wonderful to work with. I love the wood feel. The more you use them, the softer they get. Second, I like that they are natural and renewable and not made in Mexico from aluminum. These were manufactured in Japan. However, these are over-priced on amazon. I purchased these for around $3 each. Highly recommended."
5,For Real!,"I really feel this track! Singer/Rapper Tae Williams,AC,former""Incense"" and ""Herb"" lead singer, and a veteran performer for years,and former ""Incense"" and ""Herb"" lead singer,keyboardist David Hill,and Lefamu (A.K.A. Gary Lee) round out this diverse quartet! This is hittin' in all areas! Look for their upcoming CD on it's way soon,and a big CD release party as well!"
4,Herman delivers,"We will assume that if you are reading this you are already a fan of of the strange humor of Herman. I admit Jim Unger's humor is not for everybody but if you enjoy Herman then this is a well made, lushly colored, and densely populated example. Well worth the money."
4,A brief description,"New York: Longmans, Green, and Co; no date; [1901 first English/1896]; the Plimpton Press; translated by Ada Wallas; grey cloth pictorial boards with red and dark green touches,, 1901. green line drawings on white endpapers, single-sided pages with text and picture; oblong 11 x 8; 24 pp. Picture book hardback.A take-off from the Struwwelpeter or Slovenly Peter idea:""Next Peter finds three naughty brats/whose little heads are rough as mats./Although they turn and twist about/He firmly combs the tangles out/And when their hair is smooth and neat/The all go proudly down the street.""Peter cleans up. ."
5,An evilly engrossing collection,"The Closet Devil: 13 Devils In The Old Familiar Places is an anthology of short stories by Anthony Pour, an acknowledged master of macbre fantasy deftly told with a keen sense of dark humor. People say ""the Devil made me do it"" but no one ever applauds the Devil for his tireless work. Life is not fair, it simply is what it is, and according to The Closet Devil, the Devil himself is just doing his job - nothing personal, it's just what he does best. The thirteen tales are meant to follow the Devil's influence from the Date Line into the setting sun, and his relationship especially with the working men and women who struggle to make ends meet without complaints or whining. An evilly engrossing collection, that will leave the reader rethinking basic assumptions about human nature."
5,"Simpley Brill, Fab and very Funny",Must say only bought this because Paul Gross was in it. I've never seen on tv as i don't have the channel it's shown on. Nor did i expect to enjoy watching something about a theater company but i absolutley loved every second of it if you haven't seen it your missing out big time. Very funny and differant i've watched it over and over again i can't wait till my next dvd arrives to me haven't seen that one either but i'm sure i'll enjoy it. I say it's very much well worth the buy.
4,This show grew on me,"I wasn't sure that I would watch after the 1st episode but about half way through the 2nd, I began to enjoy the show. By the last episode I was laughing out loud."
5,"It's ""Outrageous Fortune"" to See This Show","A friend of mine taped this Canadian show off the Sundance Channel and mailed it to me. I have never loved a TV series more. It's hilarious and touching and features Canada's top actors in a backstage satire of a company that resembles Ontario's Stratford Festival. Don't miss ""Slings and Arrows"" if you're a theater buff. It's going to be a cult hit as soon as the DVD hits America."
5,Not To Be.....Missed,"This is the show that proves that television can be good. Do not miss this. Superbly written, well acted and directed. It is a shame that there hasn't been a wider audience for this. Share it with your friends. Who knows, it could begin a trend of talent returning to television."
5,Delicious! A must for theater buffs.,"If you've had any association with the theater -- professional or amateur -- you will love this series.Cleverly written and wonderfully performed by a cast of talented actors, the series nicely hits on all the stereotypes and age-old jokes about show folks without once making them seem shopworn. Along the way, it hits on some deep truths about why theater, not to mention Shakespeare, is so important to so many of us.My favorite elements: A cast that is (to me, at least) unknown. The two old character actors in the company who function a bit like a Greek chorus, adding acerbic or cheeky asides (or sometimes just a well-timed grimace) as the action advances."
3,"Not ""Due South,"" but amusing none the less","Bought this purely on the strength of Paul Gross, who starred in my favorite dramady of all time: Due South.Let's just get that out of the way once and for all: Slings and Arrows is nothing like it! Frazier does not make an appearance!That said, it's not terrible. It's better than most American TV IMHO, and I was starting to enjoy it by the 3rd or 4th episode. Of course, there are only 6, so season 1 was over just when it was hitting its stride.Lots of dark humor and messed up, washed out characters, but you still end up liking (some of) them, and there are moments of real humor and even real redemption in there.I'll probably get the rest of the seasons from the library though."
3,Be forwarned-- this is for mature audiences only.,I gave it a 3 star rating to be fair to the actors. I mistakenly thought it would be as family friendly as Due South.. I was wrong & tossed it in the trash after viewing part of the first episode..If the first episode has that much vulger language & sexality than it is reasonable to assume the others will follow suit..I was very dissapointed as I truly agree that Paul Gross is a very underated actor..
5,What a great show,"In the middle of each season I found myself blurting out: ""What a great show!"" It's funny and moving and literate. It's wonderful to see good acting, good editing, and extremely good writing combined. Compared to U.S. fare, it should get six stars."
3,A romantic comedy,"I enjoyed this book because there were some great comic touches. Yes...the heroine was very ditsy but I loved the Duke. It's not a keeper for me, but none the less, an enjoyable read for a winter's evening."
2,Not everyone can do humor,I admire greatly Balogh. But not everyone can write a farse or write humor. This story was silly and stupid. It was a waste of time and I hated this story.
2,Heroine is a twit!!,"The plot of the story isn't bad but the heroine makes you want to throw the book out a window. She's so stupid by the middle of the book you want to stop reading just so you can get away from her stupidity, not to mention that she's so full of herself. At points in the book events occur and have nothing to do with her, but she gets all flustered thinking it has to be about her and you just want to slap some sense into her, hence the throwing out the window. If you like Mary Balogh I suggest reading a different title by her, this one has to be one of the worst!!!!"
3,not bad..very...,"ok, this book wasn't that bad, just kind of boring. I was able to read the whole thing. But that's not saying much, I read anything. It was just a little bit boring. But maybe that's just the mood that I am in. It was an interesting concept for a book, I just think that maybe she spent too much time describing scenery and such and not enough time developing her characters."
4,crazy myself,"I am a little resistant to the characterization of the mommy as angry/violent-- but the pics are beautiful, the message (of others chipping in) is good, and, as long as people recognize this is just one type of experience with bipolar disorder, I recommend it."
1,Non functional product,"The product was purchased and was found faulty (did not work) no sound. Contacted seller explained the issue and asked for their suggestions. I was told the unit had been tested and worked well. Get an expert to hook up unit. I must be a dummy. In any event I checked the unit out and by accident decovered an earphone jack had been broken off inside the port. Proof positive the unit had not been testd. I notified the seller who responded that to ship it back would be at my expense and after review they would determine any refund.After being lied to I see no reason to spend any more money with this seller and hope no one else does either. It was a shame the unit looked good and was packaged well,also prompt shipping. I was surprised when it did not work and digusted with the sellers responses."
4,"Sound, practical reminders for success.","Excellent. The only thing that could improve this set of four audio tapes would be for Mr. Pitino to get some voice coaching and rerecord the tapes. I was expecting a great motivating voice, but Mr. Pitino sounds stale and staged. He is obviously reading something word for word. The only thing missing was the sound of the pages turning. But the BOTTOM LINE - VERY INSPIRATIONAL!!!"
4,"If success is a choice, why ate the Celts still bad?","I respect Rick Pitino as a coach and basketball man but wish he would use his 10 steps to motivate his own financial basketball albatross, Antoine Walker. Until then, Pitino's words are just lip service to me..."
4,Coach Pitino has practical and motivational methods.,"The basis of this book is to ""work hard"". He goes into the ""whys"" of working hard. How to convince yourself and others you lead of the payoffs of hard work."
4,It is a Choice,"Whether you are a basketball fan or not, this is a great book for those who are searching for the leader in themself. Rick Pitino has some very interesting stories of his past that makes this book. It is a well organized outline of how to develop yourself to be a better person. If you are searching, read it... if you are not, look elsewhere."
4,Good but redundant,"I read this book about 6 months ago and saw it again here on Amazon. I will give credit to Pitino for giving some no-nonsense good advice and some very interesting anecdotes, but he says them over and over again without really getting into much detail. In a couple chapters I found the EXACT same paragraph written twice. It looked like he had cut & pasted from a previous chapter. He also gives little detail about what he says. For example, he says we need to learn how to get in ""the zone"" (a term used by basketball players which refers to when an average player plays like an All-American without any effort) more often. NO KIDDING RICK! Players have tried a million different ways to get into the zone. It's not that simple. If you want a self help program, get Anthony Robbins' Personal Power II. It's second to none."
4,Straight talk from the coach.,"Everything he says in the book makes sense.The most enjoyable part was the real life examples that make you feel that anything he says is possible.Like all books you should use the ""shopping cart"" method knowing you won't agree with everything and that is ok. The stuff you don't like don't put in your ""shopping"" cart but leave it. The stuff you do like, take it with you and apply it.Book is well organized and easy to read. I'm glad my boss recommended it to me and I'm the farthest thing from a sports fan and still enjoyed it very much."
3,Don't let the name fool ya.,"Don't let the name fool ya. Its says business but what draws me to it are the coaching and sports stories he tells. Rick of course is a basketball coach, and a successful one at that, and so I like to draw from his experiences and success as a coach (being a coach myself). A lot of his stories are from his days at Kentucky and and what he did to be a successful coach and I like that part, but the parts that get away from the coaching aspect and try to be a success manual get boring at times. Just give me the damn sports stories."
5,One of the best management tools I have in my arsenal !,"I read this book on a plane between Dallas and Boston and by the time I returned to my office, I had a new outlook on how to not only draw the best from my employees; but also how to remove the negative components from my organization. Straight-forward, to the point and very honest...a fantastic primer for managers at all levels...I've re-read it three times already !"
1,Torn in seconds,"I had another Henrietta and my dogs LOVED it! I was so excited for them to have new ones on the way. Within seconds of throwing out the new Henrietta, she was ripped in half. Not a strong product. I have Corgis. . . not huge dogs."
1,Very Poor Quality,Within 3 minutes my female puppy had this poorly made toy in pieces. I purchase many toys for my dogs and this one was without a doubt one of the worst. This is a latex toy that is easily chewed to pieces and is a choking hazard to the dog. I couldn't figure out how to give it less than a one star rating (which it deserves).
3,If Only. . .,"I bought this book with much hope and many expectations--having visited soem of the sites personally, I was disappointed in the photographic coverage and the writing. If someone is going to be buy this book in hopes of using it as a reference volume, then pass it by. It serves more as a personal portfolio for Ms. Randall to pose in old costumes, and share some tales in reference to the places she mentions. I found the photos of Wyndcliffe quite compelling, but having photographed it many times now over the last 12 years, I realize what is missing more than anything else.Don't get me wrong, it's a fine book, for what it is--an amusement for someone not looking for a lot of depth or knowledge on a wonderful subject."
4,A Wonderful Read!!,"A very nostalgic and melancholy look at some incredible estates both standing and demolished. The author chose most of her subjects because of interesting ""ghost"" stories that accompany them. Photographs are eery and of sometimes unimportant things like statutes, but there are beautiful interior and exterior shots as well. This is an enjoyable book preserving some of these homes for posterity, but it's not really meant for anyone interested in architecture. There are no floor plans or detailed descriptions of the architectural elements. This book is just meant to be enjoyed."
3,Good Info - Poor Art,"I'm thankful to Ms Randall for providing a well written comprehensive guiebook. Regretfully, her photographic attempts do not match the subject - they are amateurish in the worst sense of the definition. Her technique and taste require a lot of development."
2,"Pretty good, but certainly not great.",Monica Randall is a good writer covering a great subject. I don't need her standing in as a model/ghost in various pictures. The subject is fascinating enough unto itself. Stop with the extra whipped cream on my ecliar!
5,A truly extraordinary book,"Phantoms of the Hudson Valley: The Glorious Estates of a Lost Era has been out of print for a long time; now this captivating compendium of black-and-white (actually, sepia-tinted) photography of deserted homes and castles, paired with spooky ghost stories and secrets of lost splendor. The result is a one-of-a-kind coffee table book that strongly encapsulates these formerly lavish living areas. A truly extraordinary book, Phantoms of the Hudson Valley is the next best thing to personally sightseeing the lost opulence and forgotten spirits of the area, and deserves the highest outstanding recommendation."
5,Great TV,"I did my homework for several weeks. Studied Consumer Reports, read on line reviews, etc. Finally settled on this 50"", then set out to find the best deal. Shopped around and kept comparing prices. Brought it home, took it right out of the box and hooked it to the regular satelite reveiver (the new HD received had not arrived yet) The picture is awesome. Great on all reception, even old black and white movies. Regular broadcasts are so good that some even look like HD. Now the HD receiver has come and the HD is wonderful as well as all of the other reception. We love it. We made no adjustments, right out of the box is great. Sony is wonderful."
1,Avoid Sony projection TVs,"I paid $2200 for new product and it was junk in less than 4 years. Worse, I spent $200 on repairs before determining I should send it to recycling. Product line discontinued now. Never buy one used or try to fix one. Just replacing the $110 lamp is not going to work. Even Sony support told me to avoid ever trying to fix one of these terrible products."
1,Sony TV,"I own a Sony KDFE50A10, LCD. TV. Its 3 years old and I am getting diagonal lines on the top 1/3 of my screen. I E mailed Sony and their technitions said there are many varibles and maybe it was ran a long time, sorry but maybe its at the end of its life. It did have a good picture untill this. I don't like the support because thay just don't care. DON'T BUY IT !"
1,DON'T BUY IT,"I have had this model for a little under 2 years. The Optical Block has gone bad. Even though Sony has settled at least one class action law suit regarding the defective piece of equipment, they have only included specific models. This one is not included, even though the internet is loaded with people with this exact model having the same ""blue haze"" issue. Cost just quoted to me to fix...$1200. And, I just replaced the light bulb for another $200. Sony just keeps telling me I am out of luck. I will never buy another Sony product as long as I live."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV!!! IT WILL GO BAD WITHIN 2 YEARS!!,"This television does have some great capabilities and wonderful picture... that is... until 2 years go by and it's no longer under warranty. Then the B Block goes bad. $800-1000 to fix it and Sony will not issue a recall! SEARCH KDF-E50A10 B Block on you're favorite search engine, mine is not the only one.RESEARCH before you buy. Please."
1,Sony KDF-E50A10 and other Sony big screens,"Sorry for all of you who have this television. I feel your pain. Just like some other reviews, great tv for a few years but junk in the long run! This model of Sony along with many other models have a design/engineering (defective optical block)flaw that led to a class action suit against Sony, just google it and you'll see. After many supervisors from Sonylistens, etc. only got me an offer from Sony to purchase another tv at a discounted price which I turned down, because why would I buy from you again now that my $2,000 tv after 5 years is not worth a penny! Bad Sony, you won't step up to plate and take care of long time customers."
5,Excellent for Video Gamers.,"I got this Sony 50"" LCD T.V. from RentaCenter and I am very glad I did get it then the 32"" CRT I was going to get at first. The sound is awesome and the picture is great. I connected my PC to it and I can now surf the web during commercials. It is HDTV ready so when ever I get a reciever that would be awesome. I can't wait to jump into the video games again. I'm 23 and lost interest in video games until now."
3,Samsung is better,I bought this right after black friday. Only reason I went for the Sony instead of the Samsung 50 is the price. It can't hold a black level compared to the Samsung HL-R5067W.
2,Shame On Sony - software glitch and no split screen.,"Just bought this new 50"" LCD 3 days ago and already very dissapointed. Found out through some technical sources that this tv has software issues and needs an update to correct the set from shutting off after 49 days of use. Go to www.updatemytv.com to see if your set is also a victum of this hassle. Then to find out they cannot even get out until sometime next month to install the update. Sounds like another Microsoft windows problem.... Then very dissapointed that the set does not have split screen, every other LCD projection that I looked at has this feature. The freeze function actually puts a split screen up, so the technology is there they just skimped on this model. Consider returning."
4,"So far, so good.","We've had this model of Sony tv since February 2006 and haven't had any issues or problems with ours yet. We bought this to replace our dead RCA big screen and it took some time to adjust the the widescreen format. It still bugs me that many programs are not shown in widescreen format so you end up with the black bars on each side. You can zoom the picture (2 ways) to fill the screen and I don't mind it, but it bothers my husband because it either chops off the top and bottom or it distorts the image just a bit. My other complaint is that some widescreen movies are still shown in a tiny letterbox format on our large widescreen tv, just doesn't make sense to me. We use this tv in our living room as the main tv and have a blu-ray dvd player hooked up to it and movies do look better than they used to. I just hope this tv lasts us until we are ready to upgrade to a larger size with true 1080p at 120Hz or better."
4,I never lose my way again,I have been using this GPS unit for a year now. It is really a very good tool. Since I'm in Europe I couldn't use the added software so I bought GPSPilot and Route. I use a PC base routeplanner (Route 66 Benelux) and download the maps into the Palm. Takes me about 10 minutes extra from the normal planning process.The GPS unit keeps me on course all the time. Very impressive.
4,"Good device, works as described software lacks options",The unit does what the vendor claims but the software bundle lacks functionality. The up side to that is there is a lot of third party software that works with it and they make it more useful. I particularly liked Quo Vadis by Marcosoft and Magellan's NAV Companion. With out them I would rate the product 2 or 3 stars at best.
4,GPS for PalmV,"For anyone looking for a GPS unit that owns a PalmV, I'd suggest getting this unit. Most GPS units that have similar functionality usually have a smaller screen than the PalmV. The software works just fine too. Plan where you want to go on your PC then hotsink it to your PalmV. The GPS unit will also work with other Rand McNally software like TripMaker."
3,"Good for scholars, but its too heavy to be an introduction","I bought this book because it had five stars, hoping that it wouldintroduce me to Meister Eckhart's spirituality. However, the bookis long and is very difficult to penetrate. This volume may be ofinterest to scholars on Eckhart's life and teachings, but persons whoare looking for an introduction to Meister Eckhart may wish to chooseanother book.Muji"
5,If you like the first one. . .,"My girls (7 and 11) are pretty tough customers when it comes to video games. This one is certainly their favorite, however. It's quite similar to the first edition, but has a number of additional challenges including crying babies and ringing cell phones to annoy the customers! As they progress in skill, players are rewarded with options to purchase better equipment, faster chefs, and decorations to attract more customers. Not brain surgery by any stretch, but certainly beats Pac Man for educational value! Highly recommended."
4,"fun, addicting, frustrating",This game is a blast. The only problem is that it gets very difficult. Playing the same level 100 times gets frustrating.
5,Fun follow up to Diner Dash 1,"If your stuck on Diner Dash1, or if you have completed it, this is a fun follow up. If you are stuck, this game will give you the knowledge to complete all the levels of the first game. Well worth the money!"
4,Okay game,"Diner Dash 2 is pretty good although Diner Dash 3 (Flo on the Go) is a lot more fun. Either buy Diner Dash 1 or 3, 2 isn't worth it compared to the other two versions."
2,A little disappointing,"I am looking for some good Techno stuff. I heard a track from this CD on AOL radio. I really liked it. However, after two listens, I feel that there is only really good song on the CD. The rest of the songs are a bit difficult to listen to. Keeping an open mind and giving it a chance might help. But, as with a lot of techno, it is repetitive and a little boring. It was hard for me to get to the end of the whole CD"
2,Torn in ten minutes,"I had hight hopes for this type of dog toy. I have a 19-month-old Golden Retriever and he got the Squeaker-Man ripped open in about ten minutes. If your dog isn't too rough on toys it would probably be fine - better than the stuffed animals. Or, if you follow the directions and not leave the dog alone with the toy (ya, right!)I think my dog really likes to get the squeakers out of dog toys - it's a challenge for him.We still have the Squeaker-Man hanging around, minus one leg. He's certainly lasted longer than other toys."
3,Not so tough,"I gave this toy 3 stars since it costs about the same as a plush bear from Petco or Petsmart. However, it took only slightly longer (15 minutes instead of 5) for my dog to shred it. If you have a really agressive chewing dog, good luck in finding a stuffed toy that will survive."
4,Tough Stuff,"My shepherd collie mix shreds any stuffed toy to 'desqueak' it in minutes. She doesn't eat any of the fluff it's just the sheer joy of killing the thing and pulling out what makes it talk.But this little man has withstood the past two year! This is the only toy, along with her orka blue rubber jack, that she has had since puppydom and lasted her.She is an aggressive chewer and I have to get her all of the extra large bones...I can't imagine how the other people reviewing this had these problems...maybe it was torn along the seam? Seriously this thing has lasted and lasted....somebody mentioned that the squeaker is a little hard to squeak (because the material is so tough) which meant my pup wasn't so interested in it when we first got it, but since then she's warmed up and it's a regular tug of war toy and has stayed in shape!"
1,Piece of trash,"This really deserves no stars. This didn't even last two minutes with our dog. The squeaker only squeaked once. He immediately was able to pull off a piece of the black binding around the edge, and then puffs of stuffing. The dollar store toy he got at the same time lasted much longer and was way cheaper. Totally not worth it, esp. if you have a toy destroyer dog."
3,squeaker-man,"The toy is very rugged - Star hasn't been able to rip it open yet. One thing though, the squeaker is very hard to press and barely makes a sound, so she loses interest in it pretty fast"
2,First-timer? Try another book,"This book is interesting and very well written, however it is not very helpful for a novice in winemaking. I would suggest looking for another book.The review written by David J. Leudemann sums it up best."
2,Not complete handbook,The book does not explain enough concepts of winemaking to a beginner and is not detailed enough for an expert.
2,"Good Music, But The Mix Is Annoying...","...I really wanted to like this mix, I did; but in the end I couldn't. For one, there is nothing original in the track selection on this CD...any good funk compilation will have the same songs. Two, the intro bu Grandmaster Flash racks on my nerves...he basically says the same thing for each track. I don't even think the mix is that good. I also found the tempo shifts to be extremely sloppy. Sorry Bernie, love the show, but the CD is a rip!For a better mix/compilation, go see The Tom Joyner Morning Show Old School Mix and it's follow-on Tom Joyner's Old School Mix Returns. Steve 'Silk' Hurley nails it, G. Flash could learn from Silk."
2,I was quazy not to listen.,"This was one time that the reviewer was right on point with his assessment. This CD was bad, and mainly due to the DJ. The song selections were okay, but that mix was very annoying. Luckily, I paid only $4 (including shipping) for the CD on Half.com."
4,A little cracker,"I use this device with a Sony Vaio F801A running Windows ME.It works very well indeed, no complaints at all."
2,Very disapointed,I brought this Item from a TV show called HSC and i hardly used it so it should still be working like new but i started to use it a month ago and was planning to get serious in working out with it when one day it just stopped i tried the reset info and it still doesn't want to work. it starts like it going to adjust to the weight but then it goes back to its regular starting point. it seems like its something with the digital board. Can anyone help me with this? I don't know what to rate this product because it really never worked enough for me to even think of what to rate it. If you ask me i'm really not happy with it.
4,A most enjoyable read,I really enjoyed reading this book. The descriptions of the boat and are so vivid I felt I could see the rooms. The writing is funny and clever and I look forward to finding out what happens next.
4,Romance on the River,"Cruising through Charles Bowen's Delta Queen is a fine way to get a feel for what it must be like be take a trip on this legendary boat. Growing up on the Ohio river, I often saw her pass by and wanted to go along. The story of Walker Raines and the woman he loves pulls you into the atmosphere and history of both contempory riverboating and the past.Can't wait for his next book!"
5,Great DVD!,"This DVD is amazing. I got it mainly for the live concert, the documentary is way more than what I expected! A definite plus!!!"
5,Excellent concert,One of the best reggae DVDs ever. Good audio and video quality and a very captivating performance.
5,Great Music&Vibe,Bob Marley&The Wailers are ROcking The Stage on this set.The Music&Vibe are Very Spirited all the way through here.You Feel The Creativity&Genius Of MR.Marley From The Stage&His Words&Music Hit Hard.
5,One of the best live performances in popular music,"If you can recall, Time Magazine picked Bob's ""Exodus"" as the best album of the last 100 years. This performance has been capsuled by, I believe the Smithsonian to be played after another 100 years. I do not want to be so arrogant but I will tell you Bob is the best musician that ever lived. There is not a topic/subject in life for which he did not write a song.""Life is heavy as a feather - heavy as lead""--too deep - go figure that out. Get this now!!!"
4,Monsterous good time,"I watched this last night and enjoyed it. Not because it was good. It's not good and the movie knows that. But it's not horrible either. It's probably the best movie about a killer dick I've ever seen. (come to think of it, it might be the only one I've seen seen). Think those bad movies they put on the SciFi channel on Saturdays and make it funnier and involving a 9 3/4 inch dick. The movie has comedy, a little bit of porn (nothing super graphic, which surprised me), science fictiony stuff, porn stars, a wee bit of serious stuff thrown in, and of course, horror without too much gore. If you like not so great movies, I'd recommend checking it out. If you like porn, check it out. If you like Ron Jeremy, check it out. Ditto for Amber Bensen. Heck, if you've always wanted to see a killer dick go on a rampage, check it out."
3,dheetahs,This movie was totally crazy. The idea of a penis running around killing people is wild. We laughed so hard in parts of the movie. We have already told a few other people about the movie. The only thing I wouldve like was to see more of the monster. I also thought the movie was very well thought out. I felt this movie was so stupid that you had to laugh. It is worth checking out.
2,So bad it's bad,I had to see this because of Amber Benson and for that I don't regret it. She is fascinating. But the rest of the film was not so good. Different but not different enough to overcome the plain rauchiness of the film. I can only give it a two and it would be lower except for Amber.
4,Very Good For The Price,"This is a very good fountain for the price. I saw what looked like an exact match for over $100.00 more. The only thing I don't like is you have to unplug it to turn it off. The light goes on and off by switch, but the water does not. I would buy this again."
3,good for the price,"Sounds great, good looks, but about 10 inches shorter than the described product. this was a disappointment. Also there was a flaw in the metal wall mounting bracket I had to really hassle with. After finally getting it up on the wall I found it had a small leak. Since I had returned the first one because it came to me in pieces (so I had no idea it was shorter than described); and I had already made the anchor holes in my walls, I felt it much less of a hassle to just stick a plant under the little leak and repair it when the opportunity avails itself. The second time around I purchased it from Endless Variety thru Amazon and the price was about $100 less than I paid for the first one."
1,Not the right item,"The measurements for this item is incorrect. It says it is 48"" tall. The fountain we received was 32"" tall.I contacted 1-2-3 Fountains and they stated that there is an error on Amazon's website. We were told by 1-2-3 fountains that the 48"" fountain we ordered is actually $416. We returned the 32"" fountain and we received a refund. The return of the fountain from 1-2-3 Fountains was straight forward and they were nice enough about the return.The price issue has still not changed on Amazon's site. It seems that all of the 1-2-3 fountains have price errors on Amazon in comparison to the 1-2-3 website. We are very unsatisfied having to go through all that trouble and feel the seller should own up to their prices stated on Amazon."
1,small and ugly,"this product is not 4 feet as they advertise, its very cheap quality not worth the moneynot recomented to buy it for your home or as gift either for that much monyit may be wort $75-8o maximam"
2,Not very good,"I had a chance to send away for one of these free and they not only sent one but two. Now I know why, probably because nobody is buying them. I had been using the Gillette Mach 3 for a while and switched a few months ago to the Fusion, so I tried this out to see how it fared gainst those. It didn't shave the hair down to my skin, yet managed to cut my neck up pretty bad. It's better than some other one and two blade razors, but it is no comparison to a Fusion or a Mach 3. I don't know how long the blades will last because I'll probably never use it again, but I bought my first Fusion about 3 months ago and the first blade still works quite well. I would suggest at least the Mach 3 Turbo over this if you cannot afford the Fusion, but the Fusion is an investment and probably cheaper over the long run."
5,Reality Check,"Reading these short stories made me feel I was next to the characters,feeling their feelings and making practical judgements aboutthe situation as opposed to viewing events from the detached perspectivethat history gives us. I kept saying to myself, ""Of course a personwould feel that way in that situation. Why didn't I realize that before?""One wonders how much clarity would be added to the current situation ifa writer with Anthony Grooms' talent would write in the same manner aboutpeople in Iraq.As I read the book, the stories built in intensity. After some, I felt asif my breath had been taken away. I was right there where I didn't wantto be. What a writer!"
2,Not what one would expect from Capcom,"Searching for a great traditional 2 player shooting game for Dreamcast? Sorry, but you will have to keep on searching. Giga Wing is just not up to the standard of quality I've come to expect from Capcom. It's too short, ridiculously unfair in the later levels, and the graphics leave something to be desired. Casual gamers may see my complaints as trivial, but I think most hardcore gamers that have experienced the old greats like 1943 and Raiden 1-2 will agree with me. My advice...stay away from Giga Wing, and get Raiden Project or G. Darius for Playstation instead."
3,Mac Intel only?,why does the product description say Mac Intel only? i thought all the CS3 products were Universal and worked with both PowerPC and Intel chips.
4,Great Dance Beat!!,I first heard this song during carnival on the carribean island of Aruba. The Soca Boys do a great version of it. It is upbeat and fast paced. The fun is contagious! It is like a carribean Hokey Pokey and my 2 year old neice loves to dance to it too! Great when cleaning the house to help pick up the pace. It definitely makes you move to the beat!!
5,western serial,"I give this dvd 5 star rating and it is very good with every chapterannd plenty action , the print is very good also the sound and for the price you would not get better. it is very interesting if you like serials and well worth watching and for alpha it is a very good one and worth the price all the way"
5,The Sicilian's Mistress by Lynne Graham (Large Print Harlequin),"Another winner from Lynne Graham! Gianni is not the perfect hero (and he definitely failed at trusting Milly) but that doesn't make him any less appealing ... this one may qualify for your ""keeper"" shelf!Description from the book back cover:After three long years Gianni D'Angelo has found Milly! However, Milly doesn't remember Gianni, or what she was to him. All she knows is that she was found after a hit-and-run accident, pregnant and with her memory gone. Gianni has the difficult task of convincing her that, once, she loved him. But Milly is horrified when she learns that she was a wealthy Sicilian's mistress ... and that her little boy is his son! Gianni is not deterred; he wants Milly and little Connor back, and his solution is simple: marriage!"
3,Not Exactly as Advertised,Although we have come around to liking this product we were initally disappointed in what was sold as a unit that did not need draining. It does need to be drained or it will automatically shut off after an hour and a half usage. We have it on top of a bowl so that it can drain and thus stay on. It cools the room well but is more work than we expected. Just know what you are buying-an air conditioner that is not self draining!
3,"Loud, but works","Okay I haven't had any of the drainage issues, but I live in Southern Cali and the humidity isn't too bad. It was easy to install, if you live in an apartment before you begin also pick up some HVAC duct tape and some weather stripping. Because I have the glass slide windows I wanted to make sure I was keeping the cold air in. We use the AC in our bedroom only approx. 300 sq. ft and it easily drops down to 71- 73 F. The only drawback is the noise, but it eventually fades to white noise and you can sleep with it. Personally for summer comfort while sleeping this unit does a good job."
4,Installation,"The unit works fine and there was no dripping on the floor. However, installation was close to impossible. The contraption to be used to vent through the window has a hole placed in such a way that when you make the sliding panel fit the window, the hole does not line up. I had to use all kinds of jerryrigged ideas to get it to vent. The panel has a sliding insert, when you line up the holes in each, it will no longer fit in the window. The unit it replaced fit perfectly. Another annoying thing is that when you turn the unit on, it automatically goes to whatever it was on before. So if it was on a/c and you turn it on, you have to push the buttons to cycle from a/c through dehumidifier to fan. The lowest setting of the fan is higher than I would expect and appears to be identical to medium. The unit that was replaced had a nice low speed that was quiet. This does not. It is quite loud."
2,Want a Wet Rug?,"My 4yr old wanted it, so I got it. Although there is a slide out tray to ""catch the water"", 90% of it ended up on my rug. Everytime he uses it I now put a dish towel underneath it to catch the spraying water, and this happens with the plastic playmat underneath too. He loves it though..."
1,Snapped in Half,"Not happy with the durability of the bits. Made the first door just fine, bit broke in half on the second door.It broke at the joint you take apart to make the extended tendons. Wonderful feature but the joint doesn,t seem strong enough."
5,Does the job.,"I bought this set to make my own entry doors. Before I tackled the entry door and side light, I used the bits to make some interior doors to build up some skills. I've just finished making a bathroom and a closet doors. So far, I have to say I am very happy with the set. Reconfiguring it for 1 3/8 was very easy. Removing the top of the rail bit to make longer tenon was also easy. I used a mortise machine, this thing comes very handy for this type of job. I should warn first time users to prepare the woods no less than 1 3/8 (I will add 1/16 for my next interior door.). I used a Freud 3 1/4 HP router, I made the rails in one pass (stub tenon), and the stiles in two passes. Looking forward to making more doors with this set."
4,Jeff As You Probably Never Knew Him,"I bought this CD about a week after I saw him perform live. No condemnation, but stage presence and audience interaction don't quite make it to a plastic disc. His ""whiskey voice"" (no aspersions meant), great guitar picking, and subtle humor make for great listening. But listen in the safety of your own abode or a parked motor vehicle (driving and listening to this puts you and others at risk when you can't help laughing). Support for small-town local theater (the Purple Rose) is added incentive."
3,Best feature: make your own films,"I'm keeping this short and sweet: SF EX2 Plus is not the best Street Fighter game out there, but it has several pros and cons:PROS:* With the Director feature, you can make your own movies. Most of the standard characters are there: Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Guile, Sagat, Dhalsim, Zangief, Vega, and Bison.* Barrel Mode is where you choose a fighter to destroy as many barrels as possible. Control is difficult, but the fun is still there. I got my best score (200,000 plus) with Chun-Li.* Bison has NO 70% damage moves. He's still deadly any how.* Chun-Li kicks enemy but with her Spinning Bird Kick and Guile's moves are much easier to execute.CONS:* NO Sakura, Akuma, Cammy, or Dan* Ryu's and Ken's hurricane kicks are a bit harder to execute* You'll need some patience on loading times* Only Chun-Li and Dhalsim has taunts, and can be difficult to execute; which that and other gestures should have been added to Director Mode"
2,Should be called Bland fighter II,"What can I say? Two years after the release of the original EX, I was expecting some major improvements, but what is this? Firstly, the game runs slower than the original, resulting in sluggish gameplay. The loading times are also unacceptable, (about three times longer than the original) and the music just isnt of the usual Capcom quality. The game itself features the usual crew, joined by some tedious newcomers. Apart from some new frames of animation, the game is slow, basic an bland. If you love Street Fighter, like me, get Alpha 3 instead."
3,Good but not great,"I think the major flaw with this game is that there is no story. This does make things kind of bland. I remember the original Street Fighter II being a world tournament with people flying around the globe. It was thin, but it was something. This is an okay game, but there's just no excitement somehow.I thought the effects were terrible until I got a new TV, and then the colors came out better. I do like the training mode, where you have to do certain attacks. They start out with some basic stuff, and then progress to things that you would never do in a fight, but isn't easy to do either. And loading time is painful. Even for playstation. Do note however, that it loads alot faster if you run this on a PS2."
4,OKAY AVERAGE.,"it is fairly good just they should of added akuma, cammy, dan, sodom,birdie and the rest of alpha characters. the only complaint is that the arcade mode is cheap you only get to fight a handfull of people with 2 boring bonus stages. and finally when you defeated bison there is no endings. but the graphics are great the new characters they added i like some of them such as area, sharon, pullum, hey come on i'm a guy i will only like the girls. great game a must buy!"
5,Kickin' it ol' school Part 2,The game was brand new and brought back memories of being a teenager. This game is better if not just as good as the first one. It has a lot of crazy characters that I wish they would bring back to the new Street Fighters. I'm glad someone had the foresight to keep it around and I was very pleased with the price.
4,Street Fighter EX2 Plus,"Street Fighter EX 2 is a product of Arika and Capcom. the game overall is pretty good and truly lives up to the Street Fighter name. Doing Special and Super Combo moves is much easier and has no button mashing involved. The graphics are good considering it is a Playstation Game. The game features a roster of a bit over 20 characters, with some unlockable characters and also extras. I have had this game for a very long time and enjoyed it. I even picked up a copy of EX3 for other characters. Overall, If you are a street fighter fan this is a must get, otherwise, you can always try it b4 u buy it at the rental place."
5,LOVE IT!,We had to take down our real black forest clock since the kids were overly interested in it and wanted to play with the weights and have it coo coo all the time. This is a lovely alternative that keeps kids interested but doesn't have anything they can grab and pull.
2,Product is just Fair,"Maybe it's the fact that you can't really lay anywhere's near a flat position when your seat is ""lowered"" on an airplane. I can never feel comfortable on those dam long flights. The seats just aren't that comfortable to begin with, maybe first class is better but we don't fly that way. Even with a neck pillow it doesn't change my comfort level. If we could only afford our own plane with a queen sized bed. A good strong sleeping pill is what I should really take before our long trips. Something that will knock me out before we leave and let me wake up refreshed when we land. Unfortunately, there isn't any such item on the market."
5,Range Kleen Drip Pans,These worked great. Bought other universal drip pans that did not fit. Will continue to buy these whenever I need new ones for my Frigidaire stove
5,Perfect Fit!,"Perfect fit for our GE stove, mod #: JBP27W0K1WW. Color is not as shown, but, rather, the chrome color that one would expect and the ""finish"" is between ""satin"" and ""shiny."" Couldn't be more pleased!"
1,Thin metal size problem,"The product has thinner metal than the original drip pans, so thin that one was bent during shipping. The two larger of the pans didn't fit my Kenmore stove."
5,Just like new,Have purchased these drip pans before from same seller. They are as true to the OEM items as possible. Fit like a dream and makes the stove top look brand new with installed. Now if there is some way to keep them clean.... the wife keeps finding ways to spoil my efforts :)
2,Beward of size,"We have a GE JCP67F4WW range bought in 2007. The 6-inch drip pans fit and look great. The 8-inch drip pans are too large. The ring in the stove-top is 7 and 5/8 inches, and the portion of the drip pan that is suppose to slip into this ring is 8 3/8 inches. The bags the 8-inch drip pans came in are labeled Genuine Renewal Part for GE/RCA/Hotpoint, WB31M15. GE screwed up again, hence the 2-star rating. Not Amazon's or McCombs Supply Co's fault."
4,Vicarious living at its best!,"Some adventures that are best experienced vicariously. This is one of those.The title really doesn't do the book justice. While moving cargo around the Caribbean, you stumble into a world of corruption, misery, piracy, debauchery and more.Take the time to read this novel. In the end, you could easily convince yourself you were on the Erika - and glad you survived.I would have given this 5 stars, but I'll reserve that for his next book."
5,Amazing story,"I couldn't stop reading this book and finished it in less than 24 hours, it was so good. Highly recommended."
5,good values,"The Legend of the Candy CaneThis was a great book for children or adults. It helps to remind us of the true meaning of Christmas! I loved the story, and my toddler loved the pictures. I highly recommend this (and already got a copy for my sister and had a friend read it, too)."
2,disappointed,I thought I was going to be able to hear the story....but it did not work on my kindle fire.
3,Great story but layout could be better,"This is an excellent story, it's just a shame that the layout has not been optimized for the iPad. The type size is somewhat small and if you try to zoom in the words and pictures are on two different pages."
3,Good Read,This is a pretty good read. It wasn't as good as I was hoping it would have been but none the less the kids like it. It does have some scriptural relevances in it but it could have been done more. Good read to the children in the 5 year range
1,Shocked and disgusted,"I was exposed to this book in what I think is the most unfortunate way possible, it was read to my child in her public school Kindergarten class. I was stunned and emotional when she came home and told me her teacher told her that a candy cane was a J for Jesus, and that the red stripes were his blood, and if she loved Jesus the white would wash it away. My child is five years old, and was disturbed by the whole thing. This book has no part of the Christmas story in it, and the tasteless metaphor of it is impossible for a young child to understand. The illustration is graphic and also not age appropriate. The only good that has come from this absurd destruction of an innocent holiday treat is that now I am even more communicative and vigilant about my child's education and exposure, even in the school I trust with my child's life and well-being."
4,Special,This is a very special book I try to read to my class every year at Chrismastime. It is always a big hit with the kids!
3,Good but not Great,"I have used Montana for Street Art often, because it is widely available and very adequate when compared to standard brands carried by local Hardware Stores. However, for the price, if I have the option I will always chooseMolotow Premium 400ml Signal White. Montana are a good ""premium paint"" but they cant compare to the quality and coverage of a Belton Molotow."
4,Kept Me Interested,I wasn't picking out the book because it seemed interesting. I picked it out thinking oh something to do. It ended up that I couldn't put it down once I started Reading it. It kept me very well interested and wanting more after i was finished reading. So if you like the romance mystery novels this is the one.
3,Way too hard!,"For used, this game is way too hard. The CPU is a cheapson of a ... And, where it says 56 characters, pbbt! You have to unlock half of them. On the bright side, the graphics are incredible. The characters ar fluid and hand drawn & thebackgrounds are in hi- quality 3D. I guess it just takes some getting used to. Rent it. Or buy it if your a hardcore gamer."
5,The best fighter for DC,"It's great. Truly worth buying. A new twist on fighting, and a refreshing change."
5,Best Game ever Played?,"This game knocks any other fighting game out the water. This is the first game that gives you 56 characters, 3 on 3 tag teams, and combos that go to a possible 300+. If you play this game, it will amaze you with its awesome 3d backgrounds. Stick with the arcade for now and when this game comes out, buy it immedeately or you will be missing out on THE best fighting game out there today."
4,M vs C 2,"Great game, brings back memories of fustration and success. Great number of characters, only wish they put more quality players in the game, you can clearly see that some are there just to fill spots. Capcom I say has a better array of characters than Marvel even if most of that side is Street Fighter players. If they release a 3rd they should think about replacing Roll, that lego robot, Sabretooth and a few others. Deadpool, and Nightcrawler wouldn't be bad additions for Marvel."
5,the game is excellent,"i love all the chosable charaters 56 from the marvel and capcom universe my favorite fighters are seorm,cyclopes, and cable but all the fighters are great and it a great game"
5,Marvel vs. Capcom 2 - The fourth in the Verses saga,"(Does that count SNK vs. Capcom?)Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is the most played machine at our local arcade. It's phenominal graphics paired with the 3-player 2D action unheard of before in other 2D fighers - even from the near-unfallable Capcom. Here we are presented with another fine installment from the 'Vs.' series, many times better than it's previous version. You start out with more characters than in Marvel vs. Capcom INCLUDING hidden characters. After releasing all the hidden characters you have 52 characters! This is an amazing amount of characters, and this doesn't scratch the surface!(Just a note: DO NOT get this game if you do not have a VMU or do not want to erase the VMU game. It's nessisary for the acquisiton of characters.)"
3,Repetative!,"This game is pretty cool, but it gets boring real quick. I got it a few hours ago and I'm here writing this review, so what does that tell you. Same 2-D graphics with 3-D backgrounds, 56 characters, and 3 on 3 combat are the games high points. I would not buy this game if I were you, but it is a great rental game. Playing it too much will drive you insane! Repetative!"
1,"Used to be good, but new games were created...","This was the best game in the world to buy, once. But now, there is no point in buying it because there are newer games.STOP!If you want to buy this game, don't! Powerstone 2 and project justice are over a million times better. This game is weak... ."
1,Common Mammals of NM,Poor quality paper and pictures. Should be marked as a childrens beginner book only.
1,OK,"""Field Guide"" is misleading since the illustrations are black-and-white, not photographs, and the descriptions very short. I would have gladly paid more for a book with color photographs and more in-depth descriptions if I could have found it. Maybe kids would like this, but I got it for an adult for Christmas, and I don't think he'll be receiving it because of its cheesy, cheap quality. Low cost books don't have to be ""cheap""."
3,small introduction to New Mexican mammals,"I am not sure it is reasonable to call this pamphlet a field guide. It covers about 30 animals with simple black and white drawings and about 5 short lines of information. The information, as far as it goes, seems to be accurate and interesting.The Abert squirrel, a notably cute squirrel that can be seen in parks and back yards, drawing attention to itself with its unusual ears, is not included. Visitors are always asking about them. I am not sure what else may not be included.On the other hand, it is only $3.74 at this time so I guess one can't expect too much. If you know basically nothing about wildlife it will tell you a little bit, just enough for starting from nothing. And I have to admit it is a rather charming little booklet. But don't expect a field guide."
5,graeter than ever,This is the greatest books i have ever read .They are everything you would want in a book !They'r so good I have my own collection and i think if you like to read and love you would love these books!BEST BOOKS!!!
3,Entertaining,"I thought this was okay, but I have to agree that the plot was a bit slapdash and the motivations didn't make much sense. I think they would be better off leaving the Avengers-related mega-plot off to the side a bit more, and keep concentrating on Peter Parker's life, rather than trying to wow us with cameos by Wolverine, Captain America, Luke Cage, et. al. Doesn't fit in with the titles previously engaging story arc.But it's still an okay read. I'd give it a 3.5, if I could."
4,Other uses,"I used the hymnal often in my sunday school class as a source of prayers to share in unison reading. Since we weren't singers we also read the text of hymns. The variety of sources in one volume was very useful. My class was elderly women and none objected to the new Hymnal. Despite its inclusion of ""new"" material I don't feel it will outdate as quickly as many of the faddish hymnals of the 70's"
2,Song,Love the music in this book and also has prayers that we use T church. Like going over them at home
1,An ad for the model school/model convention industry,"This is a classic ""wolf designing the security system for the henhouse"" book. The author is a former owner of modeling schools who also gets paid to go to expensive modeling conventions supported by the schools. The advice in the book that modeling schools are worthwhile renders the whole book suspect. Avoid this one."
1,Dangerous!,"This sparse book (138 pages, but double spaced so it takes up a lot more paper than the number of words should) is actually dangerous. It is written by a former modeling school owner, and it actually suggests that going to modeling schools is a good way for people to enter professional modeling! That advice is directly opposite that given by virtually every knowledgeable, independent modeling industry professional, and could cost model hopefuls thousands of dollars in worthless classes and other services provided by ""modeling schools"". This book should be avoided!"
5,"Great collection of ""naughty elves""...","OK, you may find this review a little biased, as my husband Jon Sprunk's first published work, ""The Artist"" appears in this anthology, but as a long-time reader of fantasy, I think I can say in all honesty that the stories included here are interesting and well-written. My favorites (besides the obvious!) are: ""Curve of Her Claw"", by Margaret McGaffey Fisk, ""Rotten Blood"" by Murray Leeder, and ""Songs"" by Barbara Geiger, to name a few. Give it a try...you may find you didn't know as much about elves as you thought you did....."
5,Excellent Read!!,"This is an excellent read. I thoroughly enjoyed each and could not put it down. I especially liked the ""Diminishing"" by Erin MacKay and ""Bad Company"" by K. D. Wentworth. I would highly recommend this collection."
1,Not working for me.,"This is not working very well.I got it for use with ebooks fromThe NY Public LibraryIt's easy enough to loadbut often stops for no reason in the middle of a sectionand is very difficult to resume where you left off.It just doesn't seem reliable.It is quite inexpensive, maybe a more expensive model would work better."
2,Product with problems,"I bought this product because it is inexpensive and compatible with the New York Public Library's audio books. The first Colby I bought would often freeze randomly (I would have to remove the AAA battery to restart it) and the player would occasionally make a loud electronic squeal and fast-forward. The company replaced it quickly. The second one I received has the same problems, though they occur less often.To be fair, I don't know much about technology; it's possible the problem is with the audio books themselves. However, I suspect this product has a lot of problems, because it came with a yellow flier in the box saying, ""STOP. Need help? Call us! [...] CALL US BEFORE YOU CONSIDER RETURNING THE PRODUCT!"""
1,Wouldn't Stay On My Daughter's Head,I bought this for my daughter to wear at her 3rd birthday party but we were disappointed in the quality. The tiara doesn't make a tight grip and kept falling off of my daughter's head. She abandoned it about five minutes after putting it on and now it's in the bottom of the toy box.
1,"Not worth the postage, much less the cost","This is basically a 2 cent headband wrapped in green ribbon with beads strung on wire unevenly attached to the headband and a picture of tinkerbell stuck to it. I could do better myself. The whole thing is uneven, wont stay on my daughters head and is actually quite ugly. If I could, I would have given it a negative star rating. Seriously, don't even bother with this."
3,Tiara,"My 3-yr.old granddaughter loved the Tiara. The front part was bent a little when we received it, and I couldn't really bend it into shape, but she didn't know the difference."
5,great read,I loved reading this book and all the others and i would recommend them all to everyone who likes time travel books
5,Good read,"As a Lynn Kurland reader, I was happy to read this story about one of the several medieval de Piaget siblings. I thoroughly enjoyed Amanda and Jake's story from the get go. As usual the on going bantering with the de Piaget siblings is quite hilarious to read. Young Montgomery and young John were delightful and endearing in this story. I could practically visualize and hear them riding after and shouting to Amanda each time she tries running away. I also liked the fact that Jake came into their old world with his own brawn to offer and teach them. It was great to see him interact with the de Piaget brothers. It was nice to read up and catch up on Kendrick as his story was the very first Lynn Kurland book that I've read over 10 years ago. I wish some of her other books were available in kindle format so I can re-read them again."
3,A romance novel with very little romance,"I gave this book 3 stars because the premise was inventive and entertaining, and it was very well written. That being said, when I pick up a romance novel, I expect to get more that the three kisses I got with this book. There was not one sex scene, steamy or otherwise in this book. Not one! Not even a detailed makeout session. Don't get me wrong, I believed that Jake had fallen for Amanda and vice versa. It was a very romantic premise too, that he travelled through time to find her and they were fated to be together. However, like I said, the only action in this book outside of this lists are three measly kisses and the implication that they sleep together on their wedding night in the last few chapters in the book. A bit of a dissapointment, that."
5,Kelin Finds A New Favorite Author,"It was a cool spring day. I was out of reading material, which constitutes a major emergency in my household, so I decided to pick up a few books while grocery shopping.Thus begins an obsession.I cracked open the book while allowing the milk to sour on the counter and read it straight through. (I believe my husband finally relented and put the milk away for me). I absolutely loved it!The writing technique is superb, the story imaginative and engaging, the characters well-written and entertaining. There were several ""laugh-out-loud"" moments, just as there were several ""nail-biting"" moments. To make a story as well-rounded as this takes rare talent and ingenuity. I've read every one of her books I can get my hands on and haven't been disappointed yet."
3,"Would have loved to read more of her books, but....","This was a wonderful time travel story - from modern day back to the 11th century. The characters were very interesting and almost believeable - till the profanity came out of their mouths! It ruined the sweetness of the female character. Would have loved to read others connected to this series, but will not because of language."
2,Just Too Boring....,"Although I LOVE this author, and I really looked forward to reading this book, it was simply too boring, especially the first 35 pages or so. I was so disappointed."
5,informative,great dvd. very enlightening to the start of calvary chapel. the Lord does often work in mysterious ways to get his truths across.
4,The most fun game I've played in a long time,"I never played the original Strider, but I loved this game. Okay, so I could beat in under an hour, but I kept coming back for more. It is one of those games that you will return to after you beat it over and over again. It is almost too easy however, so it can be beaten in at least an hour. That is what keeps this game from getting five stars. Be warned that if you like spectacular graphics, you will be very dissapointed. However, this game proves that games with okay graphics can sometimes be the most fun."
5,One of THE best games for the Playstation!,"This is one game that I can play over and over and not get tired of. The action is fast and furious. The controls are spot-on. This is how a video game should be made. The graphics is not the greatest but, hey, this is a 32-bit game. If you are a fan of arcade games, then you MUST get this one. I'm glad that I got it. This is game is short compared to other games but you can play it over and over. Also, you get the first Strider! My hat's off to Capcom for coming out with this one with a bonus game. This game must be rare because I had a hard time finding a copy that suited my collector's standards. Too bad they don't have this game on a next-generation console because I consider this one of Capcom's greatest games. So if you own a Playstation One, you owe it to yourself to get one."
5,A Strider revisit that wasn't a rediculous departure of its orgional premise.,"This felt more like a reboot of the first Strider, a-la' Evil Dead 1 and 2. It was a brief and enjoyable sidescroller game. You are a super future ninja with a plasma sword and you are trying to destroy the one world government that controls the earth, from the moon, or something. I didn't know that Glenn Beck wrote fan fiction for the Anime and video game sectors. Oh well. Nobody plays these sort of games for their story. What people do play these for is tight controls, eye watering graphics and well orchestrated platform action sequences. The sound was alright but there wasn't too many soundtracks. I bought this when it was rereleased and it even came with Strider 1 as a bonus. I certainly got my $20 worth out of this title. Its a good pick up and play title that is fun for the whole family. Wait, its selling for how much used?! Ok, well, my review still stands. Pick this title up if you are a lottery winner."
3,"Strider is back, are you ready","Strider 2 - Circa 2000GOOD:- Good/Tight controls- Fast and fun gameplay- Comes packed with original StriderBAD:- Pretty dated graphics even for when it was released- Few levels make a short gameWILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:- 2D side-scroller, with liner levels, but backgrounds are 3D- Straightforward classic arcade gameplayGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Strider- Mega Man X4 (playing as Zero and not Mega Man)- Castlevaina: symphony of the nightADDITIONAL NOTES:- Most levels are more like remakes of the classic Strider levels- Unlock Strider nemesis (the other or ""bad"" Strider) after beating the game"
5,MEMORIES,THIS GAME BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF DAYS OF OLD FROM SEGA GENESIS.FINISHED GAME 1 IN ABOUT AN HOUR.1ST TIME PLAYED ON SEGA TOOK ABOUT A WEEK. OVERALL ITS A GOOD GAME
2,"6.4 GB, too small!","It is compact and convenient to use, powerful as compared with those tiny flash drive. But there are products can carry up to 60 GB in same size. This 6.4 GB is way too behind. Not worth at all. You can find similar HD case for less than $30, and can add on Hard drive of any size up to 60 GB by yourself. easy and flexible. My recommendation is at least 30 GB."
5,Many Reviews here are for older book,"Please be advised, this book is the new 2005 edition. Many of the reviews written in 2004 or earlier are referring to an out-of-print edition.This new guide does not contain any information about putters, clubs, or balls.It *does* contains lots of information about autographs, limited edition prints, programs, tickets, flags, books, and a whole host of tournament-related memorabilia."
2,travel career development,i'm looking for the sixth edition of travel career development published in 1998
1,"Don't bother - If you must, send the bill to Borders.","I'm not very impressed with the music, lyrics or animation. The final song is ""Border's Explorer"" and it is a gross plug for Border's. Children are bombarded with advertising, but making it part of the music and dance makes it difficult for little ones to see the difference. Shame on them. I would give it negative stars if the option were allowed."
5,One of the best classic serials,"This has the touch and feel of the clasic movie serials..much action, suspense, and tongue-in-cheek of the hero that had the girls and the boys liking the good-looking hero. Budget big enough to look sensational and lens in brightly lit scenes that made each frame crisp and easy to follow. Choose any episode,sit back and enjoy!"
5,My Mom's Helper,"My Mom is 85 and is beginning to have problems baking for a crowd, with arthritis and all. Got her one of these and it did the trick. Worked like a dream right out of the box. I helped her with the first batch of cookies and a bread. Now, there is no stopping her. She bakes three times a week and wonders why Dad didn't get her one many years ago. Such a workhorse for such a reasonable price, plus it made me a hero!"
5,A Christmas Gift for Myself,"After using a Sunbeam stand mixer most of my life, it finally cratered. So, this year I have treated myself with this mixer, and it is wonderful."
2,Jangling on a certain butted nerve,"One has to just say that this tome is a veritable tease my chauffeur had it but we were lost several times in back streets which Miss Massey had not even bothered to tell us would or might or possible could encumber our progress. Also, I have to say that the constant feeble attempts at ""jokes"" come somewhat short of the standards expected, indeed required, by one. All in all a tome to be thrown from the chauffeur's window, as it was, to lie forlorn on some strasse or other as we sped away."
4,A great addition to a storage shed,"We have so many shovels and rakes, this was much needed accessory for our B-52 suncast storage building. It's exactly as pictured. The hooks seem very sturdy, and the installation is a breeze. My only complaint is that it doesn't disperse the weight enough (we only have about 20 pounds on it right now), so I think with time, the section of shed that's holding it up will warp. I'm not really sure how that could be fixed, but I did notice it when I put the first shovel on a hook. Even so, I still think it's worth the money, and believe that it will last long. We may just have to move it around a little to keep from damaging the shed itself."
4,Really nice hooks,"I was amazed by the number of items we could hang from three hooks.We were able to take all of the shovels, rakes, and garden tools from our garage and move them to the shed.I placed the hooks so they spanned one of the windows in our shed. This will provide a bit more security, or at least act has a theft deterrent.The only thing I would change is to have a way for the hooks to lock in place. If you were to bump into one of the hooks from below, you could knock the hook off of the holder."
4,Feels looks good. WATCH OUT FOR MODEL NO,"When I bought my shed at sears, the guy said the tools would fit. I did not check the model closely. I wish they did fit. they look good and quality seems solid.. WATCH OUT FOR THE MODEL no... it is in the description... as long as your model is not on the list: does not work with... I would highly recommend."
5,Great Product,This hook and bracket for my Suncast Storage Shed was easy to install and saves lots of space by organizing my tools.
4,Nice little accessory,"I bought this with the shelf unit to try and tidy up my shed and get stuff off the floor. It works well, my only issue is with how limited you are in where you can put it in the shed. I have a relatively small 10x12 shed with windows on both sides. So, after I put the shelf units in, I was very limited in where I could hang this. Otherwise, it works great!"
2,Pretty Basic,I was disappointed. The information was a little too basic and old for me. I reviewed and then put it in the giveaway pile.
5,This game is awesome!,"The original is already amazing, but Banjo Tooie takes everything it had and improves it. The worlds are much more interconnected now, and everything is far more difficult."
3,Not like Banjo Kazooie..,I really really liked Banjo-Kazooie and I guess I expected a game as good as that. Banjo-Tooie seems like an ok game. But it's NOT like Banjo-Kazooie. It's much harder and the graphics are nice but they make the game a little slow. And the fun gameplay from the first game is gone. I haven't played Tooie that much so maybe I'll like it better when I've played more.. But I'm just saying don't expect another game like Banjo-Kazooie.
2,"Nothing Like ""Banjo-Kazooie""","There are plenty of bad video game sequels. Remember ""Simon's Quest"", the sequel to the original ""Castlevania"", or ""Zelda 2"" for the NES? Why is it that so many sequels are botched? I'll get straight to the point: ""Tooie"" is a disappointment--a big one. All the fun gameplay from the first game has been replaced by stupid search-and defeat puzzles, and ""Doom""-like mazes. Gosh, if I wanted to play ""Doom"", I'd go play it! And caveat to those who get ""motion sickness"" from playing video games (I don't know how else to explain it). I can't play ""Banjo Tooie"" for more than fifteen minutes without getting sick to my stomach--really, I'm not exaggerating! The worst part is, is that I adore ""Banjo Kazooie""; it's such a shame that they had to ruin the possibilities of what could of been a good sequel. Gosh, I waited two years for this?"
2,Good Yet Done,"Banjo Tooie is a good game i'll give it this much being a 13 year old gamer. But The Review on the buy details page is right it borrows from DK64 which stole its format from Jet Force Jemini only adding more characters and worse graphics. Now Banjo Tooie uses that formula with better graphics, has a huge adventure,and is really slow. Banjo is horrendously slow even using talon trot! The speed shoes help but well they only last 10 - 15 seconds. Get this game if u want to i sorta liked it but theres better options out there folks"
4,A fine game,"This game is great! It has great graphics, plenty of stuff to do, and it contains some humorous spots. It also has plenty of secrets that have very interesting outcomes. But, it does have some bad areas. There is some very noticeable slowdown, especially in the last 2 worlds. Also, the levels are so big that sometimes it can get very tedious collecting everything. This game is very good, and I would strongly suggest buying it."
5,Nintendo`s Review,Hi my friend work at nintendo and this is the best game of the year sure it did take 2 years and that is because they kept on updating it at first they were going to make it a add on cartridge but then he said that costs too much to do that so it will be just a regular cartridge but you should have the original game to find out some of the mysteries actully its recomended that you`ve beaten the first game and the reason i got it early because i could`nt wait to use that ice key or raise shark food island and see all the tranformations in the game oh yeah you get to play as mumbo jumbo....
5,banjo tooie is awsome,i got it for christmas last year from my parents and i sat in my room and played it for an our i liked it so we got far on the game and my brother deafeated the witch and the ending is funny oh i cant tell any one because they dont have the book ha.ha. ha. ha. ha. ha. ha. ha.
5,SPECTACTULAR,THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED.DURING SCHOOL I WOULD THINK OF JIGGIES AND JINGOS.MY MOM WOULD SAY TO ME WHITE I WAS WORKING I THINK OF BANJO AND KAZOOZIE. I HOPE NINTENO MAKE A PART THREE OF THIS ACTION PACK GAME.
4,Good Game!,I loved this game. It was not as good as the first BUT it was almost it's equal. The end of the game is harder than the first though. Watch out for Gruntilda and Klungo!
5,Enjoyable,"I got this game two weeks after it came out. At first i was nostalgiac of the first game, i liked the first game more. But after I got over that, i noticed how fun this game was compared to the first game. Each level was harder and more complex than the first. And even though there are only 8 levels, compared to the 10 in the first, it took me longer to beat this one. The graphics, i have to admit, were very impressive for a sixty-four bit console. The game itself was very hard and challenging, but in a good way. This was the right way to make a sequal."
5,Simply Huge,"Banjo-Tooie is perhaps the best platformer on Nintendo 64. It plays a lot like Mario 64, Donkey Kong 64, and of course the first Banjo game, Banjo-Kazooie. Where this game differs is in pure size. It is massive. There must be ten disinct worlds with a central huge hub world connecting them. Each is unique with its own puzzles, games, bosses, and challenges. The graphics are great and the play-control is near-perfect. Playing this game does require a lot of time though, partly because some challenges in earlier worlds cannot be solved until new tasks are learned in later worlds, also just because the game is so big. The only downside to this game is an occasional slowness in the frame-rate, but it never happened in battles or such when it would have really hurt - it really didn't bother me at all. I give Banjo-Tooie 2 thumbs up...even better than the first game!"
5,my favorite game,i loved this game since i was four.i wish my nintendo64 was fixed!but i am getting the jungle green n64 (...)that is good.i have not played it since i was six.
2,NOT an ultimate anything!,"We were so diappointed in this ""ultimate"" DVD. Yes, there are three sections to it but the film is looped so that we saw the same shots numerous times - people running and jumping in the water, walkers, and the same stretch of beach to mention a few examples. The Great Walks was billed on the package as 43 minutes in length and our DVD player registered it at 40 minutes. This is an example of how the makers have tried to make it sound better than is was. The quality of the film wasn't the best either and we have a good player and TV. Some info was okay but there are other travelogs out there that are far better than this one. Not worth it."
3,2006 or 2009?,It's not clear if this DVD is 2006 or 2009 because in the product details it says 2006 and in the heading it says 2009. Confusion.
5,Get a Life...but Read this Book,This was so much fun to read. It's perfect to pick up and read a bit when you get too full of yourself. All of my friends are getting a copy for Christmas.
4,Hysterical.,"Jim Benton, It's Happy Bunny: Life. Get One. (Scholastic, 2005)So cynical, and so hilarious. Happy Bunny has been popping up all over the lunch boxes and book bags of children in the past few years, and I figured I'd see what all the fuss was about. Turns out that where there's smoke, there's certainly a good deal of fire in this case; I couldn't stop laughing. My twelve-year-old and I kept reading pages to one another. Probably not the best if you want your kid to grow up in the land of hearts and flowers, but for those of us who live in the real world, it's a clever-- and very funny-- educational tool about the people who are out to screw you over (i.e., everyone who isn't you). ****"
5,way funnny,this book was so funny. happy bunny never lets me down.book was in good shape too.mom and are pleased.
2,Great Toy but Disappointed.,"I purchased two different insects. Both arrived in good condition. Both had good sound in them and still have good sound (I have had them several months); however, the antenea's came off almost immediately and the legs do not keep their shape. I did not abuse this toy so not sure why it's out of shape. I used it as ""soft soothing"" toy for the kids at my daycare. I will not buy again or recommend."
5,Exaustive study of the strategy and tactics of WWII,"These tapes must sit on the shelves of any military historian. Their treatment is superb and thorough. The viewer is treated not only to the battle, but also to the series of events which led to the battle in the first place, putting to right a grave failure of many military texts. In order to understand the battle, it is necessary to see what went on before. The coverage of the leaders, the weapons, and the men on both sides is precise and illuminating. This series doesn't stint for political detail, following Clauswitz's doctrine that ""war is politics by other means"" The overhead shots of the various fronts and the detailed order of battle which precede the action are a better illustration than many military atlases. I have read many military histories, but yet this series expanded my knowledge. An excellent value at twice the price!"
1,Did he write this book in one afternoon?,"I can't imagine how the publisher of this book feels justified in charging $10 for it. It's poorly written, un-researched, and was obviously not proof-read! Even the back cover is full of grammar errors and misspellings. Most of the content information seems to be based on the authors own experience in the service industry."
1,New Changes Dilute Flavor,"I actually tested the new bags w/ the old ones (of which I still had a box left), and it verified that the flavor is drastically different. I really liked the old version, but the new one seems diluted and as if Choice re-engineered it to save some money. Sad, since I had to cancel my subscription."
3,Too Slow for my taste,"I was not overly excited by this tape. Not enought variety, too many props, and the pace was too slow even for a novice."
2,Skip this one,"If you are a beginner, there are much better and less intimidating introductions out there-the Kathy Smith tape, as well the Living Arts videos. Get a good book, attend a beginning class, etc. But don't get this tape. It is too long and involved, begins with standing poses which makes things unnecessarily difficult, and isn't well visualized or paced. The program does not flow or encourage repeated viewing. Intermediates can get a refresher in form from this tape but beginners will be discouraged."
4,"If you are too stressed, then you need a video like this...","Ok, if you got to my review, you are probably very disappointed with the video, BUT I feel that just as the others, I am entitled to my own opinion and that is exactly what I want to share you.Even though I had heard many negative things about yoga, when I saw the video for the first time, I had no idea exactly what yoga was about. However, after I saw and practice the video, I felt great. I felt very relaxed and I was even able to sleep much better. I feel that the video has helped me pay attention to my body and my person as well. When I am faced with a situation, I can easily stand back, take a good look at the situation and then react to that situation. Thanks to Patricia Walden, I have learned to relax and to enjoy life much better. It is great!"
1,What A Bore!!!,"This video was one long YAAAAWWWWNNN!!! Yoga is supposed to be soothing, not boring. Pass on this tape."
1,They aren't kidding when they say beginner,"I've been taking a yoga class for a couple months and thought I'd get something for when I'm not in class. The pause between poses is ridiculously long, and I really despise the ""jump"" she uses to go into lunges. It feels completely disjointed and takes away the soothing aspect of yoga. Also, for beginners especially, it would be nice if there was a little more flow. It's usually easier to go into side angle (side stretch or whatever she calls it) and THEN into triangle instead of just standing and going directly into triangle. Then there's the names . . . what she calls ""cobbler's pose"" is actually bound angle. I understand not wanting to use the Sanskrit names, but seriously?"
2,Ouch.,"I have always been excited to try Yoga. I have had introductory classes and so know the most basic of basics. Unfortunately, my first class at Crunch left me limping down the stairs in tears. I am indeed flexible and healthy so I figured I'd give it another shot with the video. My biggest problem was that I couldn't ever figure out whether or not I was aligned properly -- even with a mirror. Half the time I couldn't figure out what PW was doing or how she managed to twist herself in such and such a position; sometimes I even tipped over. I was horribly frustrated! Instead of being all whispery voiced and beatific like Patricia Walden, I got all cranky and ended up giving the video away to my step-sister (who I don't like.)"
2,"not for me, anyway","As a beginner, I found this tape too hard and too boring. And I didn't like the requirement of yoga props which I of course didn't have. And it was irritating to have to dig around the entire house to try to find things to use for props."
1,don't buy this video,This is an excruciatingly slow video. It's difficult to 'flow' through the positions because the instructor is so slow. I would not recommend this to beginners-I'm sure there are better paced videos on the market.
4,great tape for beginners,"This tape, and Patricia Walden opened up a whole new world for me....I was looking for a perfect beginner tape, and I found it in Patricia Walden....What I need to know now is where should I go from here...does she have a follow up?"
1,Dissapointing,I have attended yoga classes for a year but don't always have time to go to class so I got this video (it was highly recommended). It was so boring! Patricia was annoying and the poses didn't have a nice flow to them like my class. I recommend having a real-life instructor and then after getting familiar with the poses try Ali Macraw/Erich Shiffman's yoga video. It's the best one I've tried - beautiful scenery and music...unlike this video!
4,Good beginner tape,"This is a good tape to get started with yoga - I use it all the time. However, now that I understand the basics, I'm looking for something more like a yoga class. This tape has choppy segments where Patricia explains concepts of yoga before each pose. I end up fast-forwarding through a lot of that now. Overall, though, I've been very happy with this tape."
2,Kind of annoying.,"I'd love to find a yoga tape where the instructor doesn't look lobotomized. All the tinkly music got on my nerves as well. It was difficult to tell when one is aligned correctly, and some of the poses were quite challenging -- enough to make a beginner say, ""I'll never look like her, so why bother?"""
3,This has been a guide to judge other yoga videos,"I thought the video was great for basic thorough instructions, but after learning the positions, I found that it was aggravating to have to wait for all the instructions between positions. I also found that because I can't possibly work all the props in my limited space that I can't effectively use the video. For instance, I don't have any vacant wall space, and I don't have an acrylic ""wall"" prop to use either. I have bought a number of other yoga videos, I look for good instruction, but I also look for flow, and the main thing I look for is if the positions can be done with minimal space and props."
1,Bought it from a store -- sold it at a garage sale,"As a beginner, the instructions were simple enough to follow; however, I found using all the props made it very hard to keep up, and this stressed me. I would have kept this tape had there been alternatives to using the props or no props at all."
4,A Great Way to Start,I was just starting out with yoga and was confused by the postures I was trying to follow in the first video I bought. Using this video gave me a very good foundation and understanding. I was able to move on to other videos with confidence after that. But I do hardly ever use it now because it is slow and paced for beginners. I use it sometimes when I want to review alignment or if I don't feel up to a strenuous work. If you are a beginner I can't think of a better way to start -- but you won't stay there. But isn't that the sign of a good teacher?
5,LIstening to your body,"I found this video very useful. I was practicing a routine from a book, which was good but with this video when I am in a pose she mentions things like lengthening your spine and pushing your shoulders back and I realize that I was not getting the most out of the pose. She also gives you time to sink into the pose and focus on how your body feels. She stresses listening to and respecting your body. Afterwards I feel strong, refreshed and alive."
3,"Good, but it's lacking in variety","This is not a bad video, but you will probably get bored with the routine farily quickly. I would have like to have had more of a variety of poses - this one is very heavy on the standing poses. My yoga experience is limited, but I felt like the poses need to balance or counter-balance each other more than they do in the video. Also, the studio setting is not inspiring. This video would be good for a beginner - the poses will be challenging, but I would look for something a little more dynamic in addition in order to keep you interested in the long run."
1,Garage Sale Special,"It's ok for a start, but once you know some basics; check out Total Yoga by Tracey Rich (with Ganga White). Total Yoga is a excellent video that leaves you feeling balanced. A keeper."
4,I was hoping for a more challenging video,"This tape should be called ""Yoga Practice for People Who Have Never, Ever Done Yoga Before"". It does a good job in giving beginners a foundation, but it is not much of a ""yoga"" workout."
2,A little dull,"I am relatively new to Yoga, and have used other Living Arts tapes. What I like a lot about their Yoga tapes is the smooth flow of the Yoga session and the beautiful locations they are filmed in. These two criteria were not part of this tape, and so in my opinion, I didn't like it. It is really like having a video of a teacher telling you how to do Yoga in a film studio. Some people may not mind that, but I got bored bored bored. I could never watch this more than once. I would recommend some of their later tapes. If you live in the middle of nowhere, and have no access to any teachers or friends who do Yoga, this may be a good intro-tape. But I'd go for something else."
2,Slow-Moving,"I bought this as a place to start yoga. After watching the video 3 or 4 times, I was bored to tears. It was a good introduction to the different moves and positions, but was soooooo sloooooow. I now watch Yoga Zone on television for free and find it much more enjoyable and effective."
1,Pass on this one and choose another beginners video,"This video is sooooooooooo slow moving you will not want to put it in your VCR more than once. It is good for your very first instruction to get you acquainted with the poses, but that?s it! Choose another one of Living Art?s beginner videos; you?ll be more motivated to use it more than once. They move a little faster (thank goodness), but you?ll catch on quickly."
1,Yoga Beginners Don't Do It,"I received this as a gift. I love yoga and thought this was the most boring and sleepy yoga tape I ever saw. The plain white room and monotone voice made me catatonic every time. You are mostly forced to use props (which also annoyed me) and as for the poses, it is not the easiest tape for the beginner. I might recommend this more to an intermediate. Honestly, for me, I thought the Yoga Zone collections were much more interesting."
2,Too airy for my taste.,"Although some prefer this approach, I found the slow, casually paced, breathy-voiced presentation annoying. I would have liked more direct instruction of the physical techniques.On a more technical note, the demonstrated stances would have been easier to understand with more visual aids or better camera angles."
1,So slow,"I bought this awhile back and recently tried it when I couldn't go to class one day. The explanations between poses are so long. I realized that after 30 minutes of video, I had only done 4 or 5 poses."
3,Great for a pocket or purse address book,"This is a great address book if you are looking for something very small. I did not pay attention to the measurements of the item and was surprised at it's size. Also, the item is actually marked at a value of $1.50 but they charge a $1.99 more for ""sourcing fees"" so buyer beware that the product isn't actually worth what is charged. Overall I would say it is great if you are looking for a small address book."
4,Solid table,This table is the perfect height for our tall bed. It was fairly easy to assemble and is sturdy. A good buy.
1,It is not worth. Don't buy !,This is just a 5 page report. It is not a book and is not worth $80 at all !The report is also worthless.
4,A Good Tuner,"My fiddle mentor uses this tuner and I liked it. It is a fine tuner to use, though you might have some difficulty getting it to easily fit all violins. It will only adjust out so far. Also the lever on my tuner seems stiff and tough to ""slide open"". Nonetheless, all the tuning functions are great and it is a real treat to be able to tune your instrument no matter what noise and clatter, or even other instruments being tuned are present--the tuner ""hears"" only the string you are striking."
2,"Works for mandolin, not guitar or banjo","I bought one of these yesterday to use on my guitar, banjo, and mandolin. Today it belongs to our band's mandolin player. Why? Because it will not pick up the low-D on a 5-string banjo, or the low E on a guitar, regardless of where I placed it on the headstock. It picked up all strings on a mandolin. The high G (5th string) on the banjo would display for about one second when struck but then would disappear. On the positive side, unlike the Intelli MT500, this tuner is very accurate and is FAST - no lag in displaying the offset so you can tune accurately and quickly. I just wish it were more sensitive."
2,Save Your Scrillo,"I am currently in Iraq for well a good while lets put it that way. I ordered a Dean Hybrid Acoustic Performer guitar not realizing it had a built in tuner, which is why i purchased this wireless tuner. The concept is nice and for what seems kind of pricey for a tuner it turned out to be a big waste of money. I gave it to my friend for his Hybrid Bass guitar and the tuner does'nt pick up alot of the strings. The concept is nice but definately does'nt strike a note with me, I would say DO NOT buy this tuner."
2,Intellitouch PT2 Tuner,I had issue with this tuner. I was using it to tune a Takamine acoustic guitar. It was showing the guitar to be in tune but it definitely was not. I ended up buying a 20 dollar korg tuner with a built-in mic and had no issue at all.
4,Lots of fun,"Michael Bronski's enlightening anthology of mostly forgotten gay writings from the mid-twentieth century is a wonderful addition to any bookshelf. Alternating literary analysis with lively samples, he demolishes the notion of a dearth of gay literature from World War II to the 1969 Stonewall riot. All of the works excerpted here are out of print, and while some may not be to our modern readers' tastes, they are all evocative of gay men's lives at the times, for better or for worse. From insightful drama to hardcore erotica, these books did much to shape America's views of homosexuality, and ""Pulp Friction"" whets the appetite and showcases where today's gay literature can trace its roots. Also included is an appendix where Bronski lists a smattering of gay novels published from 1940 to 1969. This anthology is a great introduction to this genre of queer writings."
2,Treading Water,"I have read each of Thomas Perry's books as they appeared, down through the years; the first few showed promise and talent, and by the time Perry reached Butcher Boy, he had hit his stride and became one of my favorites. In recent years, the level of writing has begun to decline, and Nightlife is, sadly, his most unconvincing work. The plot is not precision-tight as in his earlier work; the time-lines and character development wander over god's green earth; the climax is pitiful and unsatisfying; and the denouement of the love interest is cheap and thin. Mr. Perry needs a long vacation, or retirement."
3,Could be better,"The complaints by some of the other reviewers are for the most part valid. The book has its moments, but it becomes a little too predictable. The serial killer just keeps staying a few steps ahead of her pursuers. The choices of what to do with the characters are not all that great. And the ending is silly. Perry has done much better in other works."
2,Disappointed,"Usually a dependable author, this time I could care less about the characters. A by-the-numbers serial killer fable, with a killer dumber than most, luckier than most. I hope for better the next time."
2,Disappointing,"NIGHTLIFE is my first Thomas Perry novel. It will be my last. The story could have been great, the characters are interesting but that's it. The writing is pedestrian, predictable and often boring. You can speed read through most of the action, especially the second half of the book. After having just read Martin Cruz Smith, Elmore Leonard and Steve Yarbrough, Perry was a miss for me."
4,Very good,"This book was highly recommended to me, as it is the type of story that I like reading. It will hold your interest from the beginning to the end, and now I am recommending it to others! Hope you enjoy it!"
1,Are we reading the same book here?,"It's startling to find positive reviews for this totally predictable, prosaic, ""crime thriller"" with an utterly unempathetic ""heroine."" Sure, this might make for a juicy read while you're stuck in between flights at an airport, or jittery over an overbooked day at the dentist's office. But track record or not, Perry's novel is as elementary and profane as anything I've read .. well, since grade school. Edgar award winner? I don't care if he won the Pulitzer; if these are the current goods, these are the goods (bads).This ""novel"" is so plot-driven and unbelievable in terms of fundamental characterization, motives, narrative, etc. we wonder if 'nuance' ever enters the writer's vocabulary. This is pure drivel. Wow, no wonder Europeans call us the stupidest nation on earth."
2,Proof Reader Needed,"I have only read first 2 chapters, and am at burn out already as this book seriously needed a proof reader simply because they say first and last names way to many times in a paragraph instead of just using first name only .Example is the name Hugo Poole is used 4 times in 1 paragraph when they are only talking about him , and is same for other characters in first 2 chapters . I am almost certain this cannot be the best of Thomas Perry ."
1,Terrible!!,This book was a total waste of time. I am still wondering why I didn't just abandon it along the way!!
5,Great suspense story,"I always read a new Thomas Perry novel as soon as possible, then, over time, I re-read them. He's that good. I loved this one -- the serial killer is both fascinating and frighteningly banal. That's quite a trick. I liked the heroine, Catherine Hobbs, and I liked watching her mind work. She is intelligent and observant, logical and dedicated. Good characters, and wonderful writing. Go buy it, read it, then try his other books. I'm particularly partial to ""Metzger's Dog"", but really, I've enjoyed them all. Perry does not repeat himself, and he is always excellent. Read him."
3,Great Beginning: Poor Climax,"The first 2/3 of this book were excellent, and up to the standards set by Perry's earlier thrillers. The last 1/3 of the book bogs down as it delves deeply into the mind of the villain as the narrative focuses on her more and more. This wouldn't be so bad if this examination of her psyche were mixed in with some action or dialogue, but there is no mixing. Where most thrillers would be racing to their breakneck conclusion, this one limps. For the first time ever, I found myself skimming a Thomas Perry book, and the ending couldn't come fast enough.Read 'Butcher's Boy' or 'Metzger's Dog,' both of which are earlier Perry books. You'll be happy you chose one of those instead of this."
4,a good read,"Didn't know whether to make it a three or four star. This book by Perry was an interesting book. The thesis is one tht is unusual - a female serial killer - not only that but one who turned on the officer who was after her. Did not think the ending was a sharp as the rest of the book, but it was an enjoyable read.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,Twofold Tension,"This was my first Thomas Perry book, and I was impressed enought to want to pursue his other works, in particular other books with Joe Pitt as protagonist. In Nightlife, the two young women around whom the story revolves are a study in contrasts: Catherine, a dedicated police officer and Tanya, a malevolent sociopath. Each is troubled by her past, each is struggling with total self-reliance and the search for personal peace. The sociopath degenerates steadily as the story progresses, and when she decides to hunt her pursuer and absorb her identity, the tension rises steadily to the climactic moment. The two characters are well drawn out, but the story really ""caught"" me when the murderous inclinations of the antagonist, Tanya, turn with creepy, disturbing intensity on Catherine. Joe Pitt is present in the story, but the spotlight never wavers from Catherine as the true protagonist. A good read."
2,Sections popped,These floats were great for about the 2 weeks they lasted. The Middle section that holds the head section up popped though on both of these floats that I purchased and made them pretty much unuseable. I will be purchasing new floats next year and these will not be them
1,Disappointed,"Was very disappointed in this floating lounge. I purchased one and it would not stay inflated the first week I had it, so I returned it and got another one thinking I just got one with a leak. Had the same problem with the second one, The raft part itself stayed inflated for a while, but the back rest did not. Very disappointed considering the price, have had much better luck with rafts I purchased at the dollar store!"
3,It was great until it fell apart,I used this float for one week. It was very comfortable and roomy. After a week one of the seams in the back tore apart. Now it is no good. It was great but for the money I wont buy another one.
1,Don't purchase this Adjustable Chaise Floating Lounge,Purchased two of these for me and my husband and they were terrible. Hard to adjust with a piece of rope. Both items ended up ripping apart and are now in the trash - don't waste your money. We were very disappointed in this product!
3,Would opt for something else,"It is nice quality as far as durability, but it's an awkward shape and not the most comfortable thing to float on. For the same price you can get a floating double person island and use it yourself. We only used it once after inflating it and the rest of the time used the pool master floating island instead."
1,Disappointed,I was disappointed when I received this. Not as nice as I had hoped for the money. The reclining feature was not stable. One of the clips broke the first time I used the float. I would have returned it if it had not come untied from our boat and blown away in the middle of the night.
3,"Close, But No Cigar","This book came close to my expectations, but it didn't quite meet them. Nevertheless, its a great way to learn some of the corporate lingo that people use these days. Its pretty amusing, but I was hoping for better explanations and history behind the phrases. Idiom books are pretty good too.All in all, its a fun book. It's a good deal for the price."
1,A huge disappointment,"I found the clues to these puzzles to be extremely vague and containing way too many obscure references. Yeah, I could have looked up the answers online or wherever, but I was hoping for a cleverly constructed set of puzzles that would allow me to figure out the answer(s)by myself. Unfortunately I also purchased (at the same time)the second book of cranium crushers, so I am doubly disappointed. I have enjoyed many of the ""Mensa"" type crossword books, but these two are apt to end up on eBay - one brand new and the other with only three puzzles filled in."
3,I'll say they're cranium crushing...,"Sorry--the stars rating system doesn't include a category for my review, so I picked neutral. I like this guy's puzzles, but this collection is for advanced experts. I'm a reasonably intelligent and educated guy, and fairly handy with crosswords. But I gave up on these. Very, very challenging clues."
3,Mixed reaction,"This book had some nice ideas in it, but as a first time coach for young swimmers, this book was not terribly helpful to me, since the whole book is geared towards coaching adult swimmers. It covers just about everything else to do with coaching, but not in terrific detail. All in all, it's ok, it has good ideas in, and is probably good for a first book for an adult coach, but you will need more."
3,Good Book,"This is an awesome book. However, after going through Hannula's work, I consider ""The Swim Coach Bible"" (vol. I & II) much more useful than this one. Anyways, this is definitely a book every dedicated swim coach should have on his bookshelf."
5,Excellent source of information,This book is a great source of information and ideas for coaching swim.Currently I coach on an age-group YMCA swim team and I am always looking for new ways to create effective practices. This book is written in an easy to search format and it gives examples that translate easily to 10 year olds! I recommend this book for age group swimming!
5,Ford Escort and Cortina Mk I and Mk II: Restoration Manual (Restoration Manuals),its a great book if your keen to do your own restoration or revival of a mk1/mk2 escort/cortina. it is a valuable resource. its really opened my eyes into rust repairs and discovered its not really that hard. my 1972 mk1 escort has come a long way since the purchase. enjoy
2,Nice design but beware Wahine 39 manufacturing defect,"I purchased this board for my wife last summer and this summer it delaminated along the bottom edge (crescent shape) exposing the inner foam. The board gets mild use (12-15 days / year) up here in New England. The company, 360 Inc., offers a 90 days warranty and wouldn't offer to replace it or even a discount if I purchased a new one. Too bad, I'll have to switch to another manufacturer."
1,Don't waste your money,"I'm not overly impressed. For starters it actually looks nice in the picture. I was shocked to see how small this mirror was, just slightly larger than those $10 mirrors at walmart. So overpriced for what you get. Don't waste your money, it's certainly not worth it."
5,"I LOVE MY ""ROBO-CAM""","I did a great deal of research before purchasing this camera and I've determined that this little Olympus is a great value for the money. My favorite features? Well, aside from the cool telescoping zoom lens that makes a hi-tech ""whirring"" sound...the size is perfect (not too big; not too small), film is easy to load, digital read-outs are simple to set and easy to read, buttons are easy to manipulate (for those of us with nails), operation is intuitive and prints are rich and sharp. Anyone can take great pictures with this camera (I've already snapped off 20+ rolls) and enlargements are crisp and true to the original. I'm thrilled with my Olympus and heartily recommend it for anyone seeking a camera with a very good zoom range (35-115), highly-rated lens and elegant, yet sturdy styling. Everyone needs a robo-cam in their camera collection. :-)"
4,Authentic and Easy New Orleans Cuisine,"I made a number of these recipes for a Creole Thanksgiving we hosted this year and was incredibly pleased with the results. The recipes are easy and straight forward with amazing results, even if you are making them for the first time. We made the Oysters in Cream, Maque Choux, Bread Pudding and Whiskey Sauce and the Pecan Pie. All our guests raved about the food."
5,A great Cookbook For The Casual Gourmet,My Gourmet Club recommended this book for New Orleans recipes for an upcomming Mardis Gras themed dinner. I made the bread pudding with whiskey sauce which I found in this book. It was easy and came out great. Other members made the Jambalaya and the Gumbo. The recipes in this book are easy to follow and it takes a lot of the mystery and mystique out of Cajun cooking. I have seen a lot of very complex recipes for this type of cuisine but this book has easy to make versions that taste as good or better then some that take hours of time and use very complicated techniques to create.
2,perfect take home for tourists,"Nice photos; good for preserving memories of a visit to NOLA. Otherwise, not of much practical application.DeMers' collaboration with Jaeger on the later published ""New Orleans Seafood Cookbook"" is far superior. Save your money and buy the Seafood Cookbook."
1,"Nice pictures, careless recipes","A friend of ours bought this for us as a gift. I'm glad we didn't spend any money on it. Every time we've tried to make any of these recipes, they haven't turned out. I get the feeling most of these weren't tested before they were put into the book."
3,TELECOMUNICATIONS AND JUSTICE IN THE WORLD,"At the end of the last decade we survive to an exhuberant prognostisism of law. The end of the world is coming soon and people like the autors of this book must be careful of their peace. Computers are not the way to make an excelente production around the world. I think that in places like Egypt, or Nairobi, or Chiapas, people don't understand the way of doing businnes around the world with a computer. Instead of that I really think that my friend Bill GGGGGG its making a good efort for estimulate all your instinct for consume and comercialization ha ha ha see you all my little readers in the next decade, the decade of computers. your friend NOE"
2,What is with all the religious references?,Somewhere in the description I missed the part where they mentioned that it's a christian financial book. Good tips but I'm just not used to mixing religion and finance like this.
1,Too religious,"I lost intrest in reading it because the more I read the more it became WAY TOO religious. If I though ""a higher power"" could have done this for me, I wouldn't have ordered the book!"
3,Not Plug and Play,"I bought this adapter for the purpose of downloading information direct from my Palm Pilot, and was disappointed when the set up took much longer than I had expected. Once you get the Adapter installed, it works wonderfully, but if you are looking for an easy plug and play item, don't buy this."
5,best adapter for mac ever!!,"This thing has at least 70ft range and is REALLY fast! Works well with everything! On a mac, you just plug it into the usb socket and it works!! No setup at all. I highly reccomend this product."
2,Poor technical support.,I was not able to successfully use this adapter with Motorola blue tooth headphones. I was able to transfer files to and from a motorola cell phone. Kensington technical support is a waste of time. They do not know their product. I was repeatedly emailed the same instructions that come with the device. Which did not solve my problems.
5,"Easy set up and good functionality, but not for W2K","I purchased this adapter to allow me to sync my Dell Axim X51 wirelessly, and it does that extremely well. The setup on a Dell Optiplex desktop was quick and easy, and the pairing and ActiveSync work quickly and easily.In fact, the adapter worked well enough that I bought a pair of inexpensive Jensen BT headphones. These also paired easily and work well (there are occasional dropouts, mainly when the computer is doing something other than just playing music).The main caveat, which I would have seen if I had checked the expanded technical specs, is that this adapter requires Windows XP. I'll have to buy another brand if I want to add Bluetooth to my older system."
3,Driver Issues,"Product works fine. Straight forward installation and user-friendly interface. Had some driver issues though. When driver was installed CPU usage was on 100% almost all the time and computer was slow. Regardless of whether bluetooth was on or off, CPU usage would always be extremely high. Once I uninstalled driver/bluetooth software, system went back to normal again."
2,No Vista Support!,"Update:They finally released Vista support. It works fine now. I use it with a Bluetooth GPS transmitter and a Toshiba laptop running MS Streets and Maps. It's very helpful when I want to go exploring in unfamiliar places.As of March 23, 2007, no Vista support. Called tech support and got a cursory ""we expect a driver in the next two weeks"" from a rather rude customer support rep (he sounded like I was the 1,000th caller today. I hope I was).This is inexcusable. Wake up, Kensington!BTW, hooked it up to a desktop running Win XP and it worked flawlessly. Can't take my desktop on the road, though. Bah!"
1,Predictably Unreliable,"This bluetooth adapter has never worked well. Connections are regularly dropped. Device profiles regularly disappear. Packets are regularly dropped. I initially tried to use with Dragon Naturally Speaking, but after so many minutes of use, recognition would drop to nearly zero - then I would go back to listen to the sound files, and they would be completely unintelligible.I just can't say enough bad things about this unit. ="
4,Almost perfect.,"A really good product. The software installs easily and works well. I've paired my phone, my wife's phone, and my Motorola H500 headset without a problem. Distance is good as I can go anywhere in my house without losing connection. It's great because I can simply unplug it, I hear 2 dings and my USB is free for whatever else I may need to plug in. I can plug it in as needed without a reboot and I've not had a single issue with it yet. My only dissapointment is that it feels a bit flimsy, almost as if you could squeeze it and it would split open. It also should have some sort of cap for further protection and possibly a case or something to keep it from getting lost. It's still a winner in my book and I'm quite pleased with it."
3,bluetooth,This product is ok. However it does not work with Windows Vista and I couldn't find a driver that would work with Vista
4,Worth the price over a generic unit.,"I purchased this adapter for the purpose of transfering pictures from my Motorola RAZR phone to my computer. Having previously owned a cheap generic unit I cannot recommend enough the importance of purchasing a name brand adapter; the generic units have very bad software. While this product from Kinsngton is not plug and play, once installed, it does provide acceptably intuitive and easy-to-use file transfer software. I have not used it with a voice headset so I cannot speak to it's abilities for such use."
5,Nice Craftmanship!,"This is a beautifully made knife. It has the look and feel of a fine tool, which it is. The blade and the tang are quite stout. The handle seemed a little awkward to hold at first because it is kind of short. But it is a ""mini"", right? BTW: treating the sheath with a little Neat's Foot Oil helped break it in quickly."
4,Los Angeles bulerias,"l.A county is a clear example of whats going in the l.a area. With a superb filming method, you can see a lot of skaters from that area. the tricks are great and its basically street skating, giving you the street atmosphere everyone in l.a has inside. A lot of names you see in mags and a lot of unkonwn riders like benet harada or the Assassins troupe kill the spots like no other. If you are fed up of spending big bucks in short videos, you can spend your bucks in this one, you wont be disappointed."
3,H.S.Trask but made in China,Bought two pairs of H.S.Trask Outpost Moccasins for family Christmas gifts. They look fine but I was disappointed when I discovered they were made in China. Recent experience with Chinese products has not been good. Time will tell if they are up to Trask standards.
4,Another great story,"Marcia Preston has become one of my favorite authors. THE PIANO MAN is an unusual story, but there are truths contained within that apply to all of us. I don't know how any mother could read this story and not identify, even if you've never had a similar experience. When I finished this book, I sent it on to my sister, and she loved it, too. As another reviewer said, if you're looking for plausibility, look elsewhere. But if you're the kind of person who sees the possibilities in life, this book will keep you enthralled. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
4,Excellent review of the 96 F1 season,"The FIA Formula 1 world championship of 1996 was a great season and the video review is an excellent chronicle of it. The beginning of the tape shows most of the teams car introduction ceremonies. Each race is given about 5 minutes of footage. The footage covers qualifying, race, and postrace interviews. In between some races, news clips are shown. Commentary is good. Video quality is good. Overall, I enjoyed this tape. I only wish it was longer."
3,Only if you can't live without the smell of pumpkin...,"Great price, but they have this kind of powdery smell that is slightly unappealing to my passengers. But, if you must have the smell of pumpkin everywhere you are, by all means!"
2,Ok for the price...,It's more ...prepare your self to travel.I liked getting tips on culture understanding.It was fun to read.But the author suggest alot of other books.Very fast and general.It's not what a needed.Not enough information for me.Sorry.
1,an achievement,"You may think that it would be impossible to make a boring film about the exciting life of French aviator and writer Antoine de St. Exupery. You're wrong. This filmmaker achieves it!By chopping up his life into bits and pieces, scrambling them, presenting such brief snippets that it is impossible to feel anything for any of the characters, this filmmaker has achieved the impossible and made St. Ex totally boring.Maybe someday a decent filmmaker will come along and do St. Exupery justice."
5,Great all around!,I had wonderful service. The book was at a great price. Is in great condition is arrived quickly.
5,Should be read by wine lovers,Vino Italiano is an excellent read for anyone wanting a good understanding of Italy's regions and the wines they produce. It's a great reference book that is neither pedantic or simplistic. The best section is the brief summary of all of Italy's major producers and their product lines.
2,needs serious editing,"If you look for anything beyond simple story line, look elsewhere!this book is a mad tangle of loose ends. There are characters introduced for no reason (a niece taking fingerprints off a spoon). There are bizarre facts tossed in for conveninece (Michael is the world's leading forensic expert on SHOES). This is an author who does not know how to juggle story lines, and she should stick to 3, not dozens. This is also an author who does not know how to write."
1,drove me crazy,"This was the worst book I have ever read.As an author, Ms London should have been ashamed of how poorly her work was edited and reviewed. It was full of mistakes on the part of both the author and the editor (typographical, grammatical, character development, plot progression). I rarely liked any of the characters except for brief scenes in which they behaved out of character... I did not believe the plot machinations. I did not believe the ""club"" was scary or should be taken as such a threat. It was from start to finish a horrid book."
1,Does this woman have an editor?!,"I agree with the reviews that say there's no character development, a horrible writing style and a million lose ends in this book. Save some time and money and do not read this book."
1,Reader Beware !!,"I have to say this is the first book I read of Cait London's, and it will definately be my last. By the time the book ended there were a 100 loose ends never discussed, they through pieces of information at you that meant nothing and was never followed up on. I was so confused in the whole book it gave me a headache. Conversations were given to you in the middle, you had no idea when it began or why. You were told that the character loved Michael since a youngster, but never why or what made her heart melt. She keeps saying that she doesn't want to be with him, even after she's practically moved in !! I only hope someone reads this and saves their money."
2,Got off to a very bad start,"The writing in the beginning of this novel was so awkward that I got a headache. There was also too much information fed to the reader at once. Eventually, the style improved, but I can't say the same for the main characters. They took too long to learn how to communicate.The heroine was inconsistent. She was strong and independent -- yet she had been married to a verbally abusive husband for more than a decade.Also, this book alternated between ""funky humor"" and drama -- sometimes melodrama. It was at its best when it portrayed the relationships between Cloe and her old friends. It was at its worst when it portrayed the central romance and the machinations of the evil cabal that controls the town.I gave this book a D+ at All About Romance."
1,Stuck in the past. More fizzle than sizzle.,"What could have been a very interesting story dies under the heavy weight of constant and redundant references to the past and the Club. Most of the major characters, especially hero and heroine, seem to spend more time thinking about the past than interacting with each other in the present. If you must read it...it should be a library pick."
3,Stylish with good functionality,"I purchased this system because I was looking in particular for a compact stero with a built in iPod dock. This compact stero has that, with good functionality and a decent sound thanks to its' included subwoofer. However I only gave it three stars based on a couple of factors that were frankly mentioned in other reviews. First of all the remote is thick and heavy, and needs to be pointed directly at the system or it will not be sensed. The biggest criticism however has to do with the display - it is so faint that it cannot be read at any angle except if viewed straight on. TEAC must have been aware of this because I saw an identical unit at Costco last week with a much more easily seen black LCD display."
2,teac mc-dx22i,It worked great for 3 months. display would fade in and out when turning on. I should have bought an extended warrenty.I was dissapointed with TEAC because they used to be high quality equipment. I purchased the system 3 years ago and still hope thatone day the display would work again. I bought a BOSS system since and been satisfied with sound and remote and display.
5,great item,"This is a great mp3 player/clock radio. It sounds good for its size and does exactly what you want it to do.Only down side is the remote is really needed as not all the functions are on the console. Still, this does not detract much from it.I would get another if needed."
2,disappointed,"I bought this product thinking it would be a great addition to my son's collage dorm room. Upon arrival it wouldn't play, a great idea of combination ipod dock, but the connecting cord didn't seem to let it play. I was near a Teac repair center, and they are fixing the thing, but if I wasn't near a repair center it would have been necessary to send it back to Amazon, something I didn't want to deal with. Hopefully the repair center will take care of the problem, it looks to be a great idea for a a product, but disappointing that it wouldn't work."
1,Avoid this book,"I agree completely with one of the other reviewers: the authors of this book took a decent book about Windows NT Server 4 and butchered it by just doing a search for 'Windows NT' and replacing with 'Windows 2000'. Too bad that they didn't proof read it afterwards, as it left obvious gaffs like 'Windows 2000, version 3.51' and the like; by about the tenth one of these I just had to put the book down. There is very little new material in this book even though W2K has a number of totally new topics. It would appear that it was rushed to press based on a Beta version of Windows 2000 so that they could cash in on the W2K craze. Sams: please have your books proof read by someone that is knowledgeable in the industry before you publish them. This could have been a useful book. Hopefully they will tune it up and republish it after fixing the problems."
1,Advice is no good if you ignore it!,"In spite of the poor review from our friend from down under, I bought this book (the only W2K Server book my local CompUSA had), while I waited for my Amazon order to arrive. I should have just waited or else opted for Next Business Day shipping!This appears to be the old NT4 Server book with new material, but far too much just updated with ""Find [Win NT] and Replace [Win 2000]"" on a word processor, as evidenced by the references to Windows 2000 Server 4 and Windows 2000 3.51.A book on W2K Server cries out for some comparisons like, ""If you did THIS with NT4, the counterpart in W2K is THIS"". You won't find them in this book. It was not only not helpful, it was downright discouraging! It almost makes me want to just stay with NT4 Server!"
1,Worst book ever purchased,"This is without a doubt the worst technical book I have ever purchased. I bought it as an interim guide whilst waiting for Mark Minasi's book to arrive - should have been more patient. The content is ill-planned, rehashed NT4 guides, and in many cases just plain wrong. My guess is that it was written based on a pre-release beta that no longer reflects the true nature of Windows 2000 server. Do yourself a big favour - avoid this book at all cost - it will waste your time as well as your money, and it will confuse you no end - just read Chapter 2 if you don't believe me."
5,A good book for the collection!,"I would have to also disagree with the bad review this book received. Sure it was written based on the Pre Release of Windows 2000 Server however I have found the book very useful and helpful. It Saved me a lot of time. I would also recommend using the ""Mastering Advance Server 2000"" book to go along with this one for more in depth details."
4,not that bad but could be better...,"It is amazing that anyone would rate this book so low. While it is true that this will not be the only book on Windows 2000 you will need, it is safe to say that there is much to gain from this book. For one, it is easy to read, is well organized, and is good value for money, IMHO. That the contents look similar to a book on NT 4.0 holds no water: Windows 2000 IS NT 5.0, which resembles NT 4.0 in many ways. So far, I've had no regrets. This book is definitely not as bad as is being portrayed."
2,Automatic switch gets stuck,"Hello,I have purchased two of these pumps for my boat. In both cases the automatic switch has failed within three months. The switches are not very reliable. My pump is located in a spot that is very hard to get to so reliability is very important to me. So I bought a float switch and hooked the pump up to that."
4,Good!,"The cover picture didn't match the book I recieved, so at first I was a bit skeptical. However, It's the same book, and that's pretty much what I asked for. I'm pleased with it."
4,B+,"The use of magical realism in August Wilson's drama about the African American experience in a post-Civil War Pittsburgh is not the only surprising rhetorical technique utilized by the playwright. Wilson infuses his characters with religious allegory to underscore the suffering brought on by slavery and discrimination. Colloquial language abounds, as does the symbolism - it is mainly these devices that drive forward what would otherwise be a play sparse in story. The characters never seem to jump off the page with that subjective ""aliveness"" that we come to expect from theatre. They feel more like tools to serve the writer's objective more than actual human beings with flaws. The only sense of reality comes from the females, who seem to speak the truth plainly more than their male counterparts, who use extended metaphors in their speech to convey the injustices of the time period. The play makes for a quick and very interesting read, but never seems to get right into the heads of any one person."
1,"buyer beware - I didn't expect much, got less, never worked","I bought this as a cheap MP3 player for my daughter's birthday. I figured she'd lose it anyway. She was excited when she opened it, but two hours later, I'd seen enough. Turns on, then off repeatedly when connected to the computer through the USB connection, so computer can never fully sync with the device. Our other MP3 players work fine.COBY ""customer support"" is horrendous. First, ""Damien"" tells me that I must charge the unit for 4 hours. I argue with him that this thing takes a AAA battery, what's to charge! He gets back to me, agrees that it is defective. Then tells me they want a $6 MONEY ORDER to process a return. Returning to Amazon."
1,Please read this!!!!Don't waste your money!!!!!,"I wanted this Mp3 because I liked that it would run on batteries and I wanted the radio feature. But, after I loaded it up with music and thinking that this was the best product ever, TWO DAYS LATER it stop working. it would turn on and then 2 seconds later ""say"" goodbye and turn off. Troubleshooting??? yeah their trouble shooting is ""change the batteries"". I even called the 800 number and the rep said ""this is a cheap product"". then said that i could return it and it would take 6-8 weeks for a refund or replacement. give me a break!! thankfully I brought it through amazon and able to return it to them (they even paid the postage!). Don't make the mistake I did and ignore the reviews....this is a horrible product and they should be ashamed to have this on the market!!!!"
3,What you save in price you make up for in battery cost,"I bought this, this because I really didn't need an mp3 player since I listen to the radio in the morning and late afternoons but the price was right. I lie to you not, I have to put a new battery in this thing everyday if not every 1.5 days. The cost adds up to the same as a an ipod after battery costs. If you don't listen to your mp3 player everyday then this is the player for you."
1,Total Piece Of Junk,"As with all Coby items, this one was a total piece of junk. The sound was great. It recorded great off the radio, but after using it for a total of TWO days it stopped working.Coby has great looking and sounding products, but they hardly last longer than it takes to take out of the box. This isn't the only Coby item that I have bought, but it will be the last.Spend the extra $20 or so for a Phillip or RCA because this (as with all of Coby stuff) is a waste of money."
1,Another Coby product bites the dust,"This is third review of a Coby product that I have put online. I was given this product as gift from a family member. It acted erratic from the start. I did manage to get it accept a few songs but after a few days wouldn't come on. I changed the battery and connected to my computer to give it another go. I couldn't get it to turn on at all. I connected it to my computer and and the computer said it didn't recognize the device. After a few minutes I noticed a strange smell. It was burnt electronics smell coming out of the top of the unit. I disconnected the USB cord and it was hot. I think the unit is fried and I barely got to use it.This one was a gift and I purchased a COBY mp3 player on my own a year before this one and it was messed up from the start. Don't say I didn't warn you, stay away from this brand name, every product I have gotten from them has been a waste of plastic, energy, electronics, and your money."
1,Don't waste your money,Two days latter it stopped transfering files from USB port. Keep disconecting and I can't transfer a single song. I didn't expect it to last forever but I bought a MP3 player and after two days I only have a walkman.Lesson learned: It's worth spending some extra cash and buy a better quality one.
1,piece of crap!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i got this in the begining of febuary for my son, i tried all this weekend to put music on it for him n cant! from the start i had to format the thing to get music off it, now cant do anything with it!!!!!! its march 3rd now."
1,"This blender sucks, period.","It looks good, feels heavy but does a terrible job of blending. I think the reason is due to the shape of the glass. The blender that this one replace was an Oster and its glass sides were sloped like a funnel channeling material down towards the blades. This one has a tube shape so you can sit there and blend for literally 5min, which is a long time, and still have chunks of ice cubes in your drink.Pass on this product. Look for something w/a funnel shaped glass container."
3,Nice blender,"Would give this 3 stars except for the vinagrette on my ceiling. Use caution when the small inner lid is open, you will get wet.Other than that it has plenty of power and works well. Would be 5 stars if not for the splashingIt was in perfect,perfect condition being a refurb."
1,Leaks like a old boat,"Just bought today - put 38 oz in to make a slush drink (well under the top of the jar). Turned on and it foam out the top like crazy. Second item by Kitchenaid that has been a disaster for me (juicer also). Love my Kitchenaid mixer but I will now stop giving them a chance. And the joke is that on the box it stated ""built with pride....""."
5,as good as new!,"I recently purchased this blender to replace my old B&D blender that I had for several years. I own other kitchen aid appliances and am very satisfied with them all, and this is no exception. What I really like about this blender is all of its power. This thing destroys what ever you put inside of it in no time at all. When I would make smoothies or mixed cocktails in my old B&D it would take twice as long and the ice wouldn't be nearly as well chopped. Another nice thing about this blender is its glass bowl. It's nice and heavy and pours real nice. My old one would make a mess when pouring and this one pours real clean. Bottom line...I paid $40 for this and it definitely worth every penny."
4,"Quite nice, easy to clean","I have several red KA products and so I bought this without actually laying hands on it. I'm not sorry. It's been a great blender so far (about 4 months into it), and they only reservation I have at all is that I think maybe the power is just a little less on high than I feel it should be - but no biggie. It's really beautiful, nice & heavy, and the glass carafe comes apart and goes in the dishwasher easily. It's very convenient. I always tried not to use my last blender b/c it was plastic and I had to handwash it. Not anymore! I recommend this blender. ADDED as of 7/23/10: Just wanted to note that I still have this, it still works, and I've had no problems with it in all these years."
4,Great Blender,This was purchased as a gift for my daughter. She is a smoothy fan. She had worked in a health food store where she used commercial blenders to make smoothies. This blender was powerful enough to meet her expectations. We purchased the chrome model and it looks very classy sitting on her counter.
1,Junk - died after just a few uses,I only used this blender 4 times in a year and it died. I ended up buying a $20 blender at Bed Bath and Beyond and it works 1000x better than this Kitchenaid.
1,Blender,"I recently purchased a KitchenAid Blender RRKSB50B in a black satin finish. I received it black but with shinny finish.(not what I wanted). Also the pulse feature did not work. By the time I discovered the problem, I had thrown away all packaging and It was simply too much trouble to file a complaint. What is my recorse? I will not buy any more products from the company."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a great example of lousy engineering. I can honestly say that anyone who has given this product a good review, has owned it for a very short period of time.A key part, the gear that transfers power to the blender blade, is cheap and guaranteed to strip within less than a couple of dozen uses. If you want something you can count on being around through at least one summer of margaritas, DON'T BUY THIS ONE!"
5,Fantastic Refurb!,"Was a little leary to buy a refurbished product, but this blender is great. Crushes through ice without an issue and my old jar fits this stand too. So I am able to make multiple drinks at a time."
4,An ode to an inexpensive blender - in the form of a list,"- I like my blender.- I wish it was bigger.- Sometimes, after use, there is a black residue on the base unit (nowhere near the delicious contents) that makes me fearful that someday it may die unexpectedly in the middle of margaritas or smoothies or salad dressing. But it is factory-reconditioned and the price is right.- The glass pitcher is easy to clean.- The rubber top is not so easy to clean, perhaps a black one would be better next time.- It's handled everything so far, including when my roommate made cranberry chutney with no liquid (A no-no for blenders in general - they crave the juicy stuff, not the dry tidbits. For those, you need a food processor)- Emulsification of dressings/sauces is a breeze, but there is a little bit of blowback through the open top."
5,The Best Blender I've ever owned.,"I've gone thru many of the ""cheap"" brand blenders over the years.This is the best! Factory-reconditioned, HA! It looks and acts BRAND spanking NEW.We've had it over 8 months now, and it still works beautifully!No bogging down of the motor when making a full pitcher of margarita's!Well worth the money!"
4,KitchenAid Blender,I am reasonably happy with this blender. It looks great and is high quality. My only complaint is that is doesn't crush ice quite as well as I'd hoped. It's hard to get a perfectly slushy margarita or smoothie out of it. The ice tends to stay in big chunks. Other than that I'm pleased.
2,Built to fail,"I am shocked how quickly this product failed. The teeth on the top of the motor, where the motor connects to the glass portion completely stripped off making a milkshake. And this was likely the 10th time using this product. Am going to now toss this one and go find something a bit more sturdy."
2,Gah! Doesn't last!,"As other people have mentioned, the rubber/plastic gears that spin under the blades will break and you will be stuck. I was pretty happy with this blender for a couple years. In the final few months, the gears popped off one by one until the last little guy broke off and I was stranded on no-smoothie island. boo. I want stuff that lasts."
4,Refurbished worked great!,"I was hesitant on buying something refurbished, as I make a practice not to. This, however, was a great buy! It works like it's brand new. I am not a frequent user, so keep that in mind. However, for a family of 2, it's been fine. I trust Kitchenaid, and also have one of their stand mixers. No problems with either one."
1,Not well refurbished,"We received this quickly and it looked great, felt heavy and substantial etc. The first time I used it I noticed that mango was not very well blended - a mango! Hardly the toughest of fruits to blend when mixed with orange juice and a banana! The second time we used it the ball bearings seemed to stop working and the whole thing is just unusable. We will be returning this pronto and feel that we've wasted too much time on this product. It's just too much of a lottery with refurbished. I'm glad that some people got one that was properly fixed. This one was not, and I hope that some other sucker doesn't wind up with it when we return it!"
2,I would avoid this blender,"There are two major flaws with this blender:1. The glass jar does not taper and this causes chunky pieces of ice or frozen fruit to remain when making smoothies, frozen cocktails, etc.2. The piece from the base that spins the blade in the jar is made or rather soft rubber. The rubber strips easily thius causing the blade not to spin properly. You then have to pay about $12-15 for a new replacement piece and S&H; and removing the old piece is a pain in the neck.Notice that KitchenAid has updated its blender which addresses both of these shortcomings."
1,"The coupler broke on ours, too.","We had this blender. Pretty happy with it for about a year. Then the hard rubber (or is it plastic) coupler broke on ours, too - just like about 10% of the Amazon reviews report. We were talking to a friend who is a serious foodie, and found out that she had the same blender, and the same problem. Ouch. Wouldn't buy another KitchenAid blender without first verifying that it has a metal coupler."
4,Very satisfied.,This was a replacement for me of the same blender. Unfortuntely Kitchen Aid's rubber part is very fragile and after it crumbled on us I ordered that part from Amazon (not this seller) and then we ruined the blender when trying to replace it ourselves. It wasn't worth having a repair shop do it as they are located in a remote part of New York City and most common people don't own cars here. It is not very convenient to bring a heavy blender on the subway. Kitchen Aid wasn't very helpful either when I asked for a replacement part. So I checked out Amazon and found this refurbished blender at a good price and ordered it aa it was just a few dollars more than repairing it. It arrived in a reasonable amount of time and was packed well. And so far so good as it is working just like new. Just be careful with the machine and make sure the blender has completely stopped running before removing the jar from the base or else the rubber part will disintegrate.
3,Good blender so far...,"I use my mixer for my margaritas and it can smell like its burning if I don't watch it. So far it has worked pretty good except for the lid leaks profusely when I turn it on. The rubber part just will not stay together with the plastic part. But, it's working right now."
4,Simple Wonderful,"I had 2 previous blender from local stores ,, all waste in 6 months .But this one is excellent , less noise , easy user and beautiful design."
5,Wonderful product!!,Purchased this blender and am very happy with it!! Looks and operates just like a brand new product!! What a quiet blender!! Makes wonderful iced coffee!! :o)
2,An Inconvenient Rattle,"The Kitchen Aid blender looks great. Alas, the item was refurbished and I mistakenly thought it would be like new. There was a noisy rattle on all speeds that was only corrected by placing the jar on the mount in one particular configuration. I was pissed. And, (I take responsibility) too lazy to return it. I think they count on that. Anyway, there it is."
1,Counted too much on the brand,"I love Kitchenaid, and I bought this blender about a year or so ago when they came out with the pink one for breast cancer awareness. I dont use blenders all that often except on the holidays, so I just used it for the first time this new years, and what a huge disappointment. I keep reading that it ""crushes ice like a monster"", well mine spins ice like a mouse. Mine wasnt a refurb either. My guess is its too late to do much about it. I have a few other things that work fine, but this was definitely not worth the money....going for the Waring...."
1,Recon blender that didn't work,The blender was reconditioned but it didn't work. No matter what speed you used the blender went at the same slow speed and could barely blend anything.
4,Working Fine...,"Used it a half dozen times for making smoothies and shakes. Looks pretty rugged--more so than the two previous blenders, both the same model, the one recommended by Consumer Reports.A little noisey..."
5,Better than new,There just simply is no reason for purchasing brand new when reconditioned is this perfect and so much less expensive. Kitchenaid has just the best stuff out for the chef in your home.
5,Great,"I ordered this blender for my wife and when we received it, she was impressed with the design and functionality. It has turned into the appliance she uses most, even her food processor jobs. Although it was a reconditioned appliance, it has all the benefits of an appliance that one would buy in a appliance department without the high cost. We have always been happy with our purchases from Amazon.com."
2,KitchenAid Blender,I've been very disappointed with the blender I purchased. It doesn't perform up to standards that I thought KitchenAid would. For the prices they sell for I expected more. I like to make a peanut butter & banana drink but the banana comes out in chunks rather then blending in with milk.
5,Great blender!,Very nice. Attractive to look at and seems to blend/chop anything that I put in there! Great buy.
5,this blender is invincible!,Mine has been grinding through rock-hard frozen fruit on a weekly basis for several months now with no signs of wear! More than I can say for most blenders...
5,refurbished is fine,"i have had this blender for about 3 months and have had no problems with it. i use it about 3 times a week. it crushes my large ice cubes, which was a major factor in me purchasing this. i would highly recommend!"
5,The BEST,"This blender, which was a given as a gift, puts mine and I bet most others to shame. It doesn't have as many speeds as some, but it doesn't need them, and when it come to crushing ice, absolutely no problem and very quickly. I would certainly recommend this item."
3,Good quality but questionable for smoothies,"This a nice blender and is fairly powerful and surprisingly quiet. Does everything you would want from a blender and it is worth the $$. However, I am slightly disappointed in its ability to successfully make good smoothies. Because the blades do not protrude to close to the outside of the jug, chunks of frozen fruit or ice cubes tend to be missed by the blender and you end up with a not so smooth smoothie. However, I have learned to deal with it but probably wouldn't purchase again for this one little annoyance."
3,kitchenaide blender,We had our kitchenaid blender like this for aprox. 4 years. The rubber broke off the part that connects to the motor and we could no longer use the blender. I liked it but I just couldn't do things like crush ice in it (that's what broke it). We now have a Cuisinart and I like it much better! I'm not sure I would recommend this if you like smoothies.
5,same as new but without paying the big price.,"Well this is my secound blender. normally this one will cost around 150 and i purchase it for 40. Big savings, the first one i give it as gift and is working like no other and mine is doing the same. Came on time in excellent condition better than new. I personally recommend this one to any person. However, make sure when connecting the glass jar it is well seated so it can not damage the blender connector witch is made of rubber. Other than that everything is perfect."
2,Proceed wtih Caution!,"We purchased this blender a couple years ago, relying largely on the KitchenAid name rather than really looking at what we were buying. Like most KitchenAid applicances, this unit is built like a tank. The problem is that the design is horrible! Difficult to pour, hard to clean, the base will come apart when using if you are not careful. If I had to do it all over, I'd save $30-40 and get a less expensive one that would work better than this ill-conceived model. And to boot - KithcenAid's customer service on this has been horrific!"
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I am glad most of you are pleased with your purchase, however, I am not, and it's not worth my time/trouble to return it. It certainly does not have the power I was hoping for. I use it primarily for smoothies, and the frozen strawberries ALWAYS remain on the bottom. There is NOTHING ""Ultra Powerful"" about the one I received, therefore I am still looking for that perfect blender."
4,KitchenAid Reconditioned Blender,"Overall, I like this blender:Pros-VERY QuietGood Price (probably have to pay more for a different brand w/ sharp blades-see Cons below)Nice DesignCons-Blades not suited for chopping; they're designed for crushing things like ice. Doesn't work great for things like fruit smoothies; there are chunks of fruit left that don't get liquified. I have an Oster blender and its blades are sharp; the KA blender blades are blunt."
3,Decent blender for what we paid,"We bought this refurbished KitchenAid RRKSB5MC ""ultra power"" 5-speed blender for less than [...] and I feel we basically got what we paid for. It successfully crushes ice and blends relatively well. Two annoyances - first is the slight smell of burning rubber when using the highest speed on the blender and second is the habit the blender has of leaving ""chunks"" of frozen berries unblended at the bottom even after multiple attempts at blending.In summary, it works, it's been reliable after roughly a month and it doesn't leak. For [...] it was worth it. If we had bought it new, I'd have returned it by now."
5,so happy,"I could not be any happier with this blender and Kitchen Aid. Our blender is a funny story. We were given a blender from another manufacturer for a wedding gift and the blade on the thing broke the third time we ever used it. I was mad and they would not honor the warranty; I had to mail the entire blender to them and pay $20 for return shipping. It was ridiculous. So I packed it back up and took it back to the store and bought the Kitchen Aid blender that matches my Stand Mixer. And then the first time my silly husband used it, he did not wash it. I called Kitchen Aid and they sent us all new parts with no hesitation. We are huge Kitchen Aid fans! I love this bender and appreciate that they replaced the parts for us - even though we were the culprits. I knew that I made the right decision when I bought the new one! Brand loyalty means something to them and to us!"
2,Faulty Design or Poor QC,"The blender seems to be high quality when first inspected but upon using has major problems. There is a loud grinding sound. The jar assembly does not align correctly with the motor base. I've been sent a new blade assembly and even a whole new unit to no avail. It's powerful and heavy duty, too bad they skimped on design or manufacturing controls!"
4,Very good Blender,"This is my second KA blender of the same type. (First was destroyed in Hurricane Katrina flood.) Both were re-conditioned. Very powerful, well made, solid blenders. The first one that I owned would have gotten 5 stars because it worked perfectly. The second one has a little problem with the on/off button making and breaking contact. It takes a little effort to depress the button just right. other than that, the blender works perfectly."
5,Bang for the buck...,"Refurb's usually turn me off, but I took a chance on this powerful blender as I was in dire need of a kitchen chopper (the current one went the way of the Dodo). For the price of a mediocre, 1-2yr use & break type of blender, this one seemed appealing due to it's power & brand-name.So far, I've been very pleased w/ the solid feel/build-quality of the blender and it's power. Also, the industrial/mechanical look to it fits in quite well in my surroundings w/ other appliances, similarly styled."
5,Great blender for the price!,"Just like all the other reviews mention, I am really impressed with the Kitchen Aid blender. It does indeed do as promised, chopping through ice, fruits, veggies, etc. I was a little hesitant buying a reconditioned item, never having purchased one before, but was very pleased with the blender I received. It came in the Kitchen Aid box with complete set of instructions and no apparent physical defects that I could see. Great way to save some $$ buying this blender!"
1,"Minimal affect, poor value for the dollar.","First: False advertising. The packing implies it covers four doors, nowhere on the product description does it say it takes 2 sheets to cover one door. The product photo hides where it says this on the package.Second: It's a lot of money considering Ice & water shield (the kind used for roofing) has the same effect. How do I know? When I realized I'd been had on the packaging, I wasn't about to get ripped-off twice. I finished the back doors with Ice & Water shield, did a sound comparison. All four doors are the same size and have the same speakers, I faded back and forth, hearing no discernible difference.Conclusion: Save your cash, find a neighbor doing his roof and ask for the end scraps."
2,Not Impressed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the many extra packs I purchased, trieng to get rid of sound vibrations in my car...............Never worked how I expected. This is not a miracle product........"
5,"Xtreme is the old reliable, good value in this kit per sqft","This kit is the best deal per sqft for doing a few panels. You could do better with a bulk kit for a full car but check the price per sqft and you'll see this is the best price small kit by far.There are cheaper alternatives that work comparably but they all come with some risk like weak adhesive, smell, or low thermal capability.Dynamat extreme just works and though it is not the cheapest, you'll have no problems with it."
5,Works great for deadening Car Door speaker rattle!,"My doors were rattling and humming until I installed Dynamat Extreme Door Kit. What a difference! No humming, rattling or distortion, just great sound!"
3,Great If You Need to Fit Lots of Small Spaces,"Worked well for dampening my car doors after a speaker upgrade. A bit fussy to cut and position though. Definitely looks easier to apply than it really is, but this seems to be the best stuff out there."
4,I think it works,If you know you don't have patients then don't do this at home. Applying this stuff right is a big part of it doing its job. IT takes alot of time especially your first door. I'm perfectionist so it took me forever to do two doors but it looks great now and i actually do think theres a difference. I wont know for sure until i do the floor.
4,It works pretty well,"I bought this for my 99 ford escort lx sedan, so I could hear my sony stereo more. I followed the instructions and applied the product to my front doors. I have noticed a difference in the sound quality of my speakers. I can hear them more and there's less vibration on the doors. As far as road noise goes, it helped just a little. This product isn't made to reduce the road noise, just to help get rid of vibrations and make your stereo system louder and easier to hear on the road. The road noise level is still the same in my car."
4,Really does work!,"I was for sure skeptical of this product doing what its box says it does (i.e. the acoustical dampening chart on box). But, after having installed it on all 4 of my doors and on the driver's side floor, I have to give it 2 thumbs up. It didn't convert my Mitsubishi into a Mercedes, but it did REALLY reduce the amount of outside noise coming in. I was yesterday sitting in my car in the soccer parking lot listening to music and could hear absolutely nothing from the outside. People walked right by talking, wind blowing, other cars, etc. and I heard nothing. I only noticed this because it was noticeable. Installation was absolutely no problem either. This stuff is very similar to tar paper, but its design keeps it completely unmessy. Good product."
4,"Good product, not enough material.","I feel like this is essential to any car with a professional audio system...on the other hand, toss in a little extra material, Dynamat! I can't beat the price on Amazon. Thanks!"
2,The Worst by In Flames,"This is the worst full-length album that this band has produced. The music is flat, the vocals are weak. I can't think of a worse release by a Nordic band in a few years. This CD isn't sellout material; it just stinks. ""The Jester Race"" is probably the old-school best by this band. ""Reroute to Remain"" is a newer release, but much more aptitude and intensity is prevalent. If ""Clayman"" is your first experience with In Flames, then I give my condolences. Their other release, both new and old, are much more fulfilling."
5,Bad Ass,"For anyone who has any doubt about INFLAMES...let em clear it up for you. Inflames, is badass. Some of the best of the best for heavy music, guitars are heavy and melodic. Go get this album and dont forget the Live album to learn about the other songs.They are from sweaden, all the good bands come from there. Thats where there wont be any doubt."
2,The WORST In Flames album BY FAR,"It is usually those who have only recently (from COLONY onward) gotten into IN FLAMES who praise this album. CLAYMAN showcases IN FLAMES at their worst - the songs are shallow, boring, repetitive, and completely and totally uninspired.. did I mention shallow? Any riffs or melodies which show some promise are always cut short for more 'groove' and 'rhythm' based riffs. Anyone who has been into IN FLAMES for a longer time (I've listened to them since LUNAR STRAIN came out) will surely acknowledge that THE JESTER RACE is without question IN FLAMES in the prime, with WHORACLE following thereafter. COLONY might have been a bit dull and disappointing, but CLAYMAN takes the cake for a band which has clearly lost its drive and originality."
4,Good album,"Not their best but still good. I personally recomend Colony, Jester Race or Whoracle; but as I said is an exelent CD too, I just give it 4 stars becouse I comapared it whit their previously albums.Buy it, it worth it!"
5,Excellent,"This is the 1st In Flames CD that I have ever heard (I bought it a Best Buy after hearing the song ""Pinball Map""), but it won't be the last (I hope). Overall, the cd is very strong, and every song on this album is heavy, unique, and pleasing to the ear of the hardcore fan. I love the mix of death metal and melodic vocals, but it's really the overall music that makes this CD and band great.Certainly, In Flames could be called hardcore, but while some of the vocals are classic death metal, I don't think that I would categorize In Flames purely as a daeth metal band. Strong, hardcore swedish metal is more like it.Favorite songs on this CD are Bullet Ride, Pinball Map, and Only For The Weak.If you like this CD, also check out Deride and the amazing ""Of One Blood"" by Shadows Fall."
2,This is NOT the In Flames album,"Not that good, simply put. The first three songs are all great, as well as ""Satellites and Astronauts"", but almost everything else is rather bland. ""Swim"" employs an obsolete '80s riff on the verses, a vibe that unwelcomely pops up throughout this disc, even in the chorus after the mighty verse riff on ""Pinball Map"".This CD is okay, but it just pales to compare to the overpowering songwriting and intricacies of The Jester Race and Soundtrack To Your Escape."
2,In Flames moving towards mainstream,"Yes, Colony was brilliant, as were In Flames previous efforts. However, with Clayman, I see In Flames becoming more like a nu-metal band. The vocals are still extreme, and the lyrics very thoughtful, but the music is getting much simpler. The solos don't compare with their past in either length or technicality, and the riffs are not as impressive either. The song ""Only for the Weak"" is a disgrace to metal and this great metal band, plus the techno sounds throughout are not needed. Hopefully, their next CD will be a turn back towards the extreme, but I imagine it will be more similar to Metallica's ""Black Album"". Still, their first four CDs are perfect."
2,perhaps I'm being presumptuous....,"...but I do not like this cd. I have both Whoracle and Colony, and like them both very much, but this one [stinks]... a lot. Anders voice has become utter [garbage]..., and there are very few good riffs, or any sense of cohesion to the songs. I am glad I have'nt yet bought this (I borrowed it from a friend), but I do feel bad that I can write this review upon 1 listen. Track 9 rocked though....Anyway, I would recommend In Flames other works, just skip this one."
2,"In Flames' ""Load""","What a bitter disappointment. This band used to be so good, that I bought this CD before I had even heard it. I wish I had listened to it first. What happened to these guys?"
1,This is metal? Why [is this death metal]?,"I originally thought this would be a metal album but it isn't. This has very, very stupid alternative lyrics and melodic guitars. I now know I don't like swedish ""metal"", but I wouldn't call it metal at all. Swedish metal should be renamed retarded boring crap. I'm angry that I wasted my money on this garbage. Swedish metal sucks. This band sucks. I'm so angry at this band I can't even write a coherent review. Itsucks, it's stupid, it's pointless .... Zero stars for stupid melodic guitars, boring bass, boring drums, boring, pointless, stupid, screeching lyrics, boring everything. I hate this band. I feel sorry for anyone who thinks this band is any good. In Flames is worse than this review. Their lyrics are as shallow, as jumbled, and as repetive as this review. Don't buy this CD."
5,"Classic, this one got me started on melodic metal 5 years ago","In Flames were some of the truly original pioneers of melodic metal, or melo-death metal, which ever you prefer. In my case as well as many other people, they are what got a lot of us started in this style and quality of music: fast paced metal, amazing guitar solos and duets, and technical drumming and double bass, with keyboards also in many cases. Clayman, in my opinion is about where In Flames peaked, with their newer albums kind of diminishing their ability somewhat (I think they're just gettin too old for it lol). Nevertheless, they put out the most monumental albums of any band I can think of in this genre. Give it a try if you're new to this type of music. Also definitely listen to their older albums including: The Jester Race/Black Ash Inheritance, Whoracle, and Colony. Can't go wrong with any of them. Also for modern-day bands keeping melodic metal alive and in good spirits, check out Kalmah, Wintersun, and As I Lay Dying."
5,One of the best examples of the power house In Flames,"Clayman really brought the band into the public world and for good reason, with combining all of their past efforts and refining them very well. The album hands down is a master piece and features great tracks like Pinball Map, Square Nothing, Bullet Ride, Only For The Weak, and the title track Clayman. Anyone new to the band should start with this album then Colony, and also their new album Come Clarity to begin a discovery of one of the best bands ever. Overall a top metal album in history."
4,It's good... but nothing new,"I give Clayman four stars because it essentially seems like a continuation of Colony, or even a bridge between Colony and Reroute to Remain. It has well-produced material, and it is full of In Flames' characteristic excellent musicianship, but it really didn't stand out as something innovative. It's quite radio-friendly, so die-hard lovers of old In Flames should probably stay clear. It is a very enjoyable listen, aside from Anders' pitiful clean singing, so it's worth picking up if you're one of those more open to the new direction In Flames is taking with their music. It's very catchy, possibly too catchy for some, but it's great for gatherings and will suffice as entertainment for a long drive."
5,MY FAVORITE IN FLAMES CD!!!,"ive only heard 3 songs off this cd (only for the weak, swim, pinball map) and the 30 second previews of the others..but just by that, i can say this is my favorite in flames cd by far, its so melodic in the songs and the guitars are amazing, deff and cd that should be named as one of metal's best archivements. Come Clarity also is a excellent cd (my 2nd favorite) stay away from Soundtrack To Your Escape, Reroute to Remain is good, not like amazing tho, and everything else is amazing, but Clayman tops them all!!"
5,Perfect Follow-Up,"After breaking down all the cynics and critics with their masterpiece "" Colony "" , In Flames waster no time and rushed back to the studio to make a brilliant follow-up with ""Clayman"" , the opening track ""Bullet Ride"" sets the tone for the rest of the album , the best track however hands down is "" Only For the Weak"". What separated this album from those before it , was Anders Friden's new vocal style which focused on melody more-so than the growl, which attracted more fans and kept the old ones. Great job!"
4,I love it,"Not the typical death metal album, much more melodic, but I love it. Along with Opeth, these guys are my favorite in the death metal genre.I'd definatly recomend this album."
4,Cute but...,"I gave this to my 1 year old for Easter and while he adores it, I cant' help but think the rabbits face looks a little more like a gopher than a rabbit. Still it is very soft, and holds up well. Maybe I'm just partial to floppy eared bunnies."
5,Good new series,"This was a darn good new series. I am going to get the Second one today . That good, i have to buy it before i will wait till the library will finally get around to getting it.Hurrah a new read!!"
3,She could've done better...,"The actually mystery was well written and smart. However, I take two stars off because 1) the heroine got on my nerves. Especially since whenever she's in the presence of hunky PI, Jeff, all she can think about is getting him in bed. And her way of ""investigating"" was accusing any suspect till she hit the right one. 2) I think Linda was trying to be clever here, but it was just plain annoying when she described each character only five to ten times throughout three-hundred pages.If you can stand h*rny and not so brilliant heroine, and hearing how each character looks five to ten times, then I think you would really enjoy this mystery."
4,Good Debut,"As an animal lover, I loved the premise of this series and think it could be a keeper. However, I do hope that there's some development for Kendra.Frankly, I thought it was stupid that she would keep showing up at the firm where she was disgraced, or that they would even let her. I thought it was ridiculous that she ran around accusing various people, hoping a confession would just fall out of the sky. I found it ludicrous that she never once had any kind of dogfight on her hands while bringing Lexie, and at times Odin and/or Py, on her pet-sitting rounds with her.Looking forward to the next installment."
5,My Favorite Book,"I first read this novel about ten years ago, and reread it faithfully every year. It's a lyrical exploration of the lives of three generations of Irish women entangled by a supernatural force that they don't understand but can't escape. Haunting and riveting, it remains in my thoughts even today."
2,Tony hawks underground,"This game is ok. Some tricks are to easy and some are impossible. I plated it in my cousins house. I refused to by it. It is stupid. I will never play it again, not even at my cousins."
5,Cool Tony Hawk,"The game is so good,I really really like it.I still on the 1 level.It is challenge to me.I almost going to the 2 level.I Play it alot.The player I made was me,Corey and Tony Hawk.That is all I have to say,bye"
5,Immortal fire within,"Couldn't agree more. This is my favourite of Sheehan's superbly written, meticulously researched books. The portrait is delicate and deep as befits the subject."
5,Ineffable,This book will make you practically omniscient...I have read PLENTY of books and this book is hands down the greatest book ever read....Talks about the source of everything in the universe and is extremely informative...religious folk shouldn't read if they plan on staying religious...
3,Strange movie,"This is one of those quirky movies that just seems a bit off. But, it's ""off"" in a completely fascinating way. This isn't a great movie, but its a good movie. When it was over, I couldn't help myself from telling several friends about it over the next few days. Hmmm... Maybe I should have given it four stars?"
3,Quality issue,The print is REASONABLE. I have another older copy which is a much better print quality but the one supplied is fair
3,about the DVDfilm/movie Rendez-Vous,"This story is basically about a woman attracted by so many men besides her which end causes one cases of dying and others all left her in the end, especially the director whom ask her to act in Romeo and Juliet play left her.....see the movie if you wish to know more about it......recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of DVDfilm/movie......Rendez-VousReview by:Dr, MR FRanc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon KahDirector 'lou ye' for film summer palaceAssistant FED chief (Internationale) to Bernanke"
2,Sill wondering,I was disappointed that I had to read words deciphered from a foreign language. The words were not on the screen long enough to read and still see the film. The plot was very poor. The ending left me wondering if there were more to come.
4,Why? Why Not?,"This is a movie to challenge our intellects as well as emotions.The main protagainist is admirably played by Juliet Binoche who bares all, body and soul, in this French film.It takes place following a rail journey which may be a metaphor for a journey through life or an assumption about someone's career choice. It emerges that Binoche's character is free spirited but who has an impact on everyone she comes into contact with.As the plot unfolds with a dynanism which is hard to follow, the viewer is challenged to understand the levels of meaning and relationship which are thrown at you by the film. In seeking to understand what is going on the question one must ask is one of how we think and how we feel.In some ways this is a very cerebral film, something Binoche retuns to in the exquisite Cache, yet in other ways this is a raw emotional film where passions run high and feelings are crucial.Not something one can just see and move on to but a very worthwhile piece of art."
3,"The French ""Ghost""","Kind of silly nonsense about an actress who is stalked by an actor whose girlfriend committed suicide. He dies and Juliette Binoche thinks shes will, too. It's muddled up with ""Romeo and Juliet."" Lots of nudity. Worth a watch."
2,No AF,"When you use this product 2x -converter you will lose Auto focus. Your Camera will rarely find the focus point before you lose the shot. Just remember it works Great, but you need to manual focus."
1,BEWARE!,"The first reviewer is correct. This mount does NOT flip down 90 degrees (as described inaccurately by Amazon), but only adjusts 30 degrees, so you cannot flip it up to hide your LCD TV under a counter."
1,5 stars for the next movie,Step by step we are moving to the truth.The fiction is banal. Hence - one star for the movie. The reality is amazing. Hence - 5 stars for the next movie on the Ames-Colby case. The next movie will be based on Dekov's memoirs.
3,works,"fuddlebucks is the fastest shipper amazon has. ordered this, arrived in about 48 hrs. nice pachmayr slip on grip. but really sticky. not many grip choies for a cz83. with armor all on them, these do very well as a second choice. easy to install and improves steadiness."
5,A classic book from a great author !,"The wealth of information contained in this book will not onlyhelp keep you healthy, but will very possibly help you avoid havingto seek professional nutritional assistance."
1,Zen Master Pretense,"This book is useless. There is nothing to learn from it. It is filled with ambiguity, and there is no way to understand anything in it. Each conversation leads to a futile ending. If you want to become nauseated, have a ball."
3,Essentials of Skilled Helping,"Definately something to read in the bathroom. Good overview of how to help, just not good suggestions of how to use it in the real world."
3,disaponted,well first of i do except quality this dvd reminded me of dupes that were on film they weren't good then they are not good now i accept only good transfers this is not its a shame that something like this get released if the quality is not there don;t release it as for as story it was ok would have enjoyed it more if the video was good proceed with fear and trembling.
4,Good Movie - Decent DVD,"While The San Francisco Story will never be considered a classic of the Western genre, it is a good movie. Joel McCrae leads the cast in a story of political corruption in San Francisco circa 1856. It is a well written movie, with some good dialogue and some decent (if somewhat low key) action scenes.The DVD may not be great, but it isn't bad, either. The picture is clear, even if not perfectly sharp at all times. The sound is also fairly clear (the audio issues are very minor), so there isn't anything to keep a classic movie buff from enjoying this DVD.Joel McCrea fans, especially, should check this one out."
5,The san francisco Story,"this movie is a bit slow and not a lot of action for this type of movie, not much to recommend on but good for the price , it is still worth watching , more of a romance than a westernSidney Blackmer is very good in it , its in B/W and sound bit low in parts, It seems that DVDs are dropping back with the sound compare to VHS tapes,"
3,Pedestrian western,"Routine, rather unimaginative western directed by Robert Parrish is set in 1856 San Francisco. A miner (Joel McCrea, looking tired and showing his age) rides into town for some fun and gets involved with shady lady (Yvonne De Carlo) who's working with corrupt politician (Sidney Blackmer, ROSEMARY'S BABY). Unremarkable but with a few touches that temporarily lift it out of the ordinary like a showdown on a beach with the gunfighters on horseback and a waterfront atmosphere that rings authentic. Two performances stand out too. Blackmer makes a cold hearted villain with an acid wit and Florence Bates as a one eyed white slaver (she shanghais drunks and sells them) has the film's best line.The DVD from the Timeless Media Group is an unexceptional transfer on the soft side with weak contrast. But certainly watchable."
4,"Quite Nice, Yes!","Brian Hopper, the older brother of Soft Machine bassist Hugh, will probably always be in his more-famous brother's shadow but he is in fact no slouch musician himself. As a founding member of Wilde Flowers he is equally as responsible for the Canterbury Sound (as his 4-CDs of archival tapes called ""Canterburied Sounds"" attest).Here he plays saxes, keyboards and programs the drums, all quite excellently. The songs range from early Wilde Flowers material to more-recent jazz outings, with guest appearances from Wilde Flowers vocalist Robert Wyatt, bassist Hugh Hopper and keyboardist Graham Flight -- although not all on the same tracks, unfortunately (Robert sings a radically-rearranged ""Hope for Happiness,"" barely recognisable from its Soft Machine days). Other tracks feature duets and solos in a variety of Britjazz styles.This CD is a nice reminder of Brian's talents and an excellent summing up of his recent musical directions."
5,Autographed!,"At the Texas Scottish Festival and Highland Games a few years ago, I was wandering through the tents, seeking some music with which to drink my stout. Alex Beaton had just finished a set and introduced a new group: Seven Nations. Seven Nations stood on that small stage and blew their music right through me. Just about every person in that tent was on their feet (myself included). People ranging in ages from 7 to 70 were tapping feet, climbing on their seats, clapping, cheering, shouting for more.After the set, I snapped up a copy of Big Dog and got all the band member's autographs. My Big Dog CD is almost worn out. The autographed play notes are proudly displayed in my stereo display case. The only thing better than the CD is their live performances. If you can, see them."
3,"Just ok, not a great fit.","I picked up a pair smalls for my two small dogs that weigh in at 11 and 14 pounds. The quality is acceptable and shirts should be good for multiple uses. I did not find the fit very good, the collar opening seems to be to big, thus the shirt hangs back on the dog too far. The velcro is used in the shirts is not the best quality and does not have a strong hold."
4,Good for the price,"This is a good camera, considering the price...very cheap.It is very user friendly. You don't really get anything special on it, but after all you only paid $120. The LCD screen is a bit small, and kind of hard to see the images when you are taking pictures. But if you want a point and shoot camera this is it. Great for a teenagers first camera, b\c its not that expensive if its lost or something. I love the fact that once you click to take the picture it takes it, unlike some cameras that take 3-5 seconds.(this is a bonus for this camera) It also had a recorder which works well. Make sure you buy a memory card for it, you will need it. So overall, nothing fancy, a point and shoot camera. If you want fancy stuff, spend a bit more money."
2,Too bad preformance doesn't live up to design,I really liked the looks and features of this neat little camera - especially the lens cover/ on-off switch. The software that came with it.. was somewhat confusing - the red eye correction feature there was very nice though.Ahh but the pics.. I contstantly got blurry images-- even of a still subject -- the camera is very sensitive to hand motion .. it was nearly impossible to hold it still enough for a good shot.I ended up using my ancient HP 1.3 MP to get pics on Easter morning. I am returning this camera and buying a slightly more expensive Panasonic with image stabilizing system.
4,Easy to use,Purchased for my 10 YO and she finds it very easy to use and take great pictures. The only drawback so far is that if you use the flash often it really drains the batteries quickly
2,FIND ANOTHER CAMERA,"I bought this camera around Christmas time, and haven't been happy with it. Although the pictures do come out some-what nicely the other features of this camera are horrible. First off, when you zoom the image doesn't appear on the screen, there is simply a orange line that appears around the image. Another thing that is not satisfactory, is the way it tuns on. Instead of having a button to turn it on it has a little sliding thing. The problem with this is that it is constantly turning on in my purse/pocket. Instead of spending your money on batteries, use that money to buy a better camera!"
4,novice,"I was very impressed with the service,price and on time delivery.The E327 5MP Digital Camera was everything I expected it to be. It was easy to use, without even reading the instructions, the pictures were sharp and well focused. The only thing that disapointed me was the 16 pictures it took to fill the camera, but with the mini SD card (1GB) I am very satisfied.This a great camera for the price."
4,great item!,"I bought this item as a gift for my mom and she loves it... i helped her set it up and the editing program that comes with it is great..it does go through batteries kinda fast, but we just make sure we carry extra batteries...other than that its a great product."
3,Not to shabby.,"I think one of the major things I disliked about the camera was its speed. When there is something important going on that I want to snap a quick photo of, it takes 10 seconds for the flash to load. Also, it eats through double A's. It is a relativly good camera for just like little still shots of your dog."
4,Great and easy to use,"This camera takes high quality pictures and is very easy to use. It doesn't have as many features as more expensive cameras, but for someone just taking pictures for fun; it's great!"
1,How can they sell a bad camera like this one?!,"Fortunately this camera was a prize... not a penny wasted on itI do not believe hot today can be sold a camera with fixed focus (maybe you think that with no focusing, your picture is taken just when you push the button - but that is not the case of this camera, that takes somewhat a second to shoot, even with no flash!!!), a sensor that seems to need a whole sun of ligth to produce a non grainy picture, an interface that because of it lack of buttons requires a lot of navigation even for simple and common adjusts. Not to mention its hungry of batteries, even alkaline or good NiMH ... is hp making batteries??? seems that they want to make money on bunchs of batteries sold to camera owners.Please stay away of this camera, unless you want to have something that deserves your angry and a your hammer!Pros: Lens cover.Cons: Too many for this space!"
2,A paler shade of blue.,"Marvel's effort to kick off a new series starring the X-Men villain Mystique, the sultry blue-skinned and crimson-haired shapeshifter who is the object of many a fanboy's fantasy, loses what little steam it had and fails IMO. I lost interest somewhere reading through these issues (collecting #s 7-13). The twists and turns are few and not compelling; the book moves too slow. The firsthand villain is not worthy of a character who can give Wolverine heartburn and the manipulations of characters end up feeling just like so much driftwood; you notice them for a moment and then move on. The best reason to buy this collection is for the covers. Mystique actually became less interesting to me in this book and I will not try to continue following this series. Viva la revoluccion? Nope, not this time. 2.5 stars."
4,Hypothesizing the new without dissing the old guard,"Levit's book asks what will be the future of feminism now that so many goals of the 60s and 70s have been accomplished. She responds that we are going to see a turn toward gender activism, rather than specific women's rights stuff. This is primarily a legal text, but all non-legal readers will be able to handle it. The book will in no way intimidate men at the same time that it avoids disrespecting Steinem-types by talking about ""post, post, post"" anything. For some feminists, this book will mention too much of the obvious. For those who are novices, but know that Betty Friedan is dated, they will enjoy Levit's insights."
5,Great original Gibson rings,"This is an original Gibson replacement part. Don't ever make the mistake of changing any kind of part in your Gibson (Les Paul, SG, Explorer or any other) if not for the real deal. I have a Les Paul and I definitely intend to maintain its value in the long term by using only Gibson original parts. Besides, they look great and will perform their job for many, many years!"
3,It's alright.,"I don't know anymore. I mean, this sounds good and all, but to tell the truth, I can't remember one lyric or guitar riff or anything. But strangely enough, I enjoy it. Southport has a HUGE Leatherface influence, which is cool. Apparently, the singer of Southport used to sing with Snuff before they broke up, and decided not to rejoin Snuff when Fat Mike convinced them to reform. This guy has a pretty darn cool voice, so does that mean Snuff was once good? Who knows. But Southport definitely has potential. This CD contains 9 songs, and it's pretty short, so it technically might be an EP, I'm not quite sure. It does fly by, which might be the source of my not remembering any lyrics, guitar riffs, etc., but a bonus to it not sticking in my head is that the album sounds brand new and fresh with each listen. Kind of funny how that works. Anyways, if you dig that heavier English sound that still has melodies aplenty, give Southport a try."
3,unfortunately generic,"this is Simon from pre-Fat Snuff's band. the music reminds me of Snuff's sadder, more deliberate tunes, it's the vocals that sort of sink the whole thing: boring, droning, colorless singing that makes every song sound exactly the same. and it's too bad, because the music is very good. even Snuff fans will be bored with this cd."
2,An orange mess,"This wig will not make you look anywhere as cute as this pic. I had to actually cut a face hole out of the wig, as you couldn't even see from underneath the bangs. It is nothing like the pic. I got this to wear to the broncos football game, as it is their color...what a huge disappointment!"
1,Boot Camp Workout - Advanced Training,"Another waste of money, why did i open both boot camp video, now i can't return them. Again poor quality, really bland, useless high school PE exercises. If you want good quality Video for excercise and fitness just got the personal training sites. This is just garbage. Someone at amazon should review all this Military Type excerise videos for content.I wouldn't even waste time on a free copy of anything with Navy Seal or Booth Camp. Just a Marketing Tag to get you to buy useless Junk."
1,complete waste of money and time,"I just purchaed this video and it is a huge disappointment and a waste of money. It's not worth the $14.99, your better off setting aside some time and doing some crunches, push-ups and lunges on your own. It's not even close to a military type workout. A better bootcamp work out is the Crunch BootCamp Workout, at least this one challenges you and is more like boot camp."
5,Outstanding ANIME side-scrolling adventure!,"This is in the style of Sonic, and Mario Brothers. This game is set in an ANIME environment with clever printed dialogue and lots of very attractive levels. Created initially back in the mid 90's, it now has an update! It works flawlessly in all versions of windows from 98 up. Massive amount of gameplay. Colorful characters and great music. The graphics, along with some pop-culture references in the game, have been updated to bring this into the 21st century. The improvements have done nothing more than make this game better than even i remember when i played it back in the day! Wonderful family-friendly game that will satisfy most everyone with it's unique quality and mezmerising gameplay. I'm 10 years older, but i am enjoying this more now than ever! You gotta buy this if you can find it. It is RARE! And, it is well worth the play!"
5,Good Fun and Serious Scholarship Too,"I enjoyed this book and learned a lot from it; how did the Soviet Union manage the concept of luxury, which would seem to be antithetical to communism? The book is well written and full of good historical detail; it also has intellgent theoretical analysis. I would use it in a class on consumer culture."
1,Magazine purchases via Amazon,I would never order a magazine subscription from Amazon again. It takes twice the time to enter and receive your first issue. I would purchase the subscription from the publisher direct as it takes less time and is the same price.
3,ZEBRAMAN 2 IS SIMPLY NOT AS GOOD AS ZEBRAMAN,"This isn't a terrible movie, but it simply isn't as good as Zebraman. This movie had a very large budget and it shows. The problem is that they spent a lot of money and a good portion of the movie making techno music videos of a Christina Aguillera meets Zebraman pop star. Although interesting at first, it gets old very quickly.This movie is a classic examply of Japanese cinema embracing style over substance and quality story telling. I would recommend renting this, but I definately regret purchasing this. I would definately get Zebraman over this any day.The original was a tale of a obsessive shut-in teacher with dreams of being a super-hero. Everything that made that movie great is not in this film. It's worth a watch, but don't set your expectations very high."
2,zebraman 2,i liked the first zebraman when it came out. it was good. so i bought zebraman 2. but zebraman 2 was not what i expected. the story line got me uninterested and the acting was so so.
5,Responsibility = results,"I first came across this book when I was a college student. It did a great job of explaining concepts I was interested in at the time, but did not have the experience necessary to explain to others. It puts forth in a fun easy to understand way a collection of proven concepts , which may be perceived as secular in nature, but are typically age old in nature and reflected in many of the world's theological teachings. At its essence, it's a guide book on how to improve your attitude, take responsibility, and how to start making things happen for yourself, rather than be the victim of everything life inevitably throws at each of us. I highly recommend this book to anyone for serious consideration and reflection. This is a particularly good book to share with anyone who can't seem to get their act together. Maybe it will be the kick in the pants they need to change."
3,Tiny,Arrived almost 2 weeks after order placed. Very small and dainty; black leather cord would fit most small children. Ended up giving it to my wife; definitely not something for a guy.
3,dog studded leather collar,This collar was a value for the price paid. But it has curled on the end of the collar which indicates a cheaper grade of leather. Hopefully when my dog gets bigger and can readjust the collar so it is not curled.
1,A Waste of Time,"The author totally ignores characterization, with the exception of the ""bad guy"" - Evangelista. To say that the other characters are cardboard personalities would be giving the author more credit than he deserves.The worst part of the book is that it is a ""set-up""; by that I mean the author introduces several threads of story lines, but never brings any of them to a conclusion. You are supposed to buy the remaining books in the series to find out how the stories end! No where on the cover, introduction, or back cover, is it stated, (or even alluded to) that by purchasing this book all you are getting is the barest of introduction to multiple plots, but never the resolution of any of them."
2,don't get a repeat...,"I goofed when I ordered this book at the same time that I ordered the Traditional Papercrafts book by the same author. Almost this entire booke, but 8 pages, (4 patterns) is in the second book. If you like paper crafts just get the traditional papercrafts book instead of this one, you get much more for your money. Is also a pain enlarging the patterns. None would have been so large that she couldn't have put the full size pattern in the books. Making something 125% bigger is the pits."
1,One of the worst books on the JFK case ever,"Simply put: one of the worst books on the jFK case. Still, it's fun to read---kind of like a good science fiction book. Suitable for all ages, 2-13 recommended."
1,The author neglects to inform the reader of evidence.,"Gus Russo knows so much from his work on this case, yet he only prints what supports his theory that JFK and RFK set the covert ops in motion that led to JFK's death. He doesn't tell you about other witnesses he interviewed, like Jean Aase, nor the evidence he uncovered in his research that doesn't fit his preconceived notion of what happened. That Castro was behind Oswald is the cover story that was prepared before the murder, and Gus may believe it, but that doesn't make it true. Any historical narative that leaves out significant facts is flawed, and in this case deliberately wrong and misleading. Bill Kelly"
1,More Posner-style nonsense,"Here's a simple little test to determine how much distortion occurs in various assassination theories: 1)The reader should determine for themselves why Mrs. Kennedy would climb out on the trunk of the assassination vehicle at such a perilous time. This step is extremely important, even if it takes a lot of looking to find the answer. 2) Compare this answer to the answers given by researchers like Mark Lane, Gerald Posner, and Gus Russo. Farewell, AmericaP.S. You need a place for no stars."
1,A very poor movie about a very interesting subject.,"I (being a fan of werewolves and other shapeshifters) rented this movie, and was greatly dissapointed. The story is poor,the transformation scenes are un-impressive and too fast to be visually interesting, and many of the computer-generated special effects don't look real. I think it's a bad movie all around (except it was filmed in Romania, so you can see some interesting architechture). If you like movies about shapeshifters, I would recomend the movies: ""The Company of Wolves"" (starring Angela Lansbury) and ""Wolf"" (starring Jack Nicholson)."
5,"Great aroma, and I don't like coffee","Bought as a Christmas present. Smells like a milk shake. I might have to try it, might make a coffee drinker out of me!"
4,she's ok,i like her i love the American idol barbies they look cool 4 stars!!! i do not like how she sings the song.
2,Cute...but WAY too tall,"hi, i got this barbie for a birthday present because I had an American Idol themed birthday party, but it is very dissapointing!!!!! It is taller than any other barbie, so no other clothes fit it. Its ""karaoke"" machine is really lame because she doesnt even sing the whole song!!! Its like, ""its ladies night, and the feelings right, oh yes its ladies night, oh what a night"" How pathetic is that??? I mean really, Mattel could have done much better."
2,Singing doll...,"I bought this for my daughter not to long ago, the thing is LOUD, I don't care what she looks like that was the doll that she wanted so I got. The kids do have fun with her but her body doesn't move like other Barbie dolls."
1,Entertainment for the drug crowd,"I received this book in the mail, why I have no idea. I think this book is serious - seriously funny to any person even partially grounded in reality. Who knew Venusians where physically identical - if only we had their secret to all being same size and weight! Maybe it's the lack of fornication?? It's a good thing only Venusians can order their food without moving their lips - you thought Americans were obese now? But if nothing else, practitioners of his astral projection skills will get lots of exercise jumping up and down to see if they are in their astral bodies or not. I suspect the true believers never land on solid earth..."
1,WHEN WORLD'S COLLIDE!!!,"I was deeply offended by a comment made in this book, it went something like, 'Unlike the sexual degeneration on Earth there is no homosexuality on the red planet'! What? Sexual degeneration?? The guy who dropped it off at my door soon got it thrown back in his face. A mindless, rambling fantasy! Good if you like cheesy 50s sci-fi pulp! Yet another End of the World story! If the planet ever does come to an end it wont be from some giant planet hurtling through space but from our own carelessness and ignorance. Please don't waste your time reading this crap!"
1,garbage,"I am an astronomer, and also well versed in metaphysics; there is no truth to any of the facts about the ""red planet"", and the metaphysics is so introductory, obviously lifted from theosophical material. a waste of money, paper and time."
1,Worst Book I ever read,"This was the worst book I have ever read, I'm glad that it was short. I skipped some of the last few pages to get to the last two chapters that everybody raved about. What a bunch of mindless rambling. I do agree with the Author, he probabley is from another planet. I'm sorry I read the previous reviews that's why I bought the book. I would have given this book a 0 if I could."
1,Is He Serious?,"I'm trying to decide is the author is seriously mentally ill or if this was written in jest. Sadly, it is NOT the worst book I've ever read"
5,amazing esoteric book,"Master Rabolu is truly a master in the theme of esoterics. the book ""Hercolubus or Red Planet"" is not a book to be taken lightly, it must be read with a lot of attention and later one must meditate in the content of each word. only people who have an open mind and heart will truly understand this masterpiece."
4,SPACE TRASH INDEED: BUT READER BEWARE!,"This book is bogus, its actually pretty entertaining. The day I received this book I began to read through it, that night I had the strangest experiences. I actually dreamed about the red planet and how cataclysmic it was to planet earth. It was a very apocalyptic scary dream. Anyways I also dreamed that I was astral traveling. I woke up and realized this book had a lot of real meaning to the author, and that the things he spoke of where very real to him. With that being said, I will now be discarding the book because of its spiritual disturbance it leaves in my house. It has a weird hocus pocus about it, and I don't want to be awakened every night with its warnings. I'm not a superstitious person. Very strange read indeed. Oh by the way this book is free, just look it up."
3,v m rabolu and Hercolubus,"The Author has combined premonition, spiritual and ego self in this little book. There is a bit of confusion when reading about Venus and how Venusian's are ""true men and women"" confusing his own ideas about homosexuality, sexuality and spiritual truth.I assume that statement, comes from ego and contradicts and negates the spiritual surmise.He pours his soul into the realistic parts and awakening yet, he also applauds his own beliefs while trying to prove his point.Ego always burns spirit.Sexuality is and always will be an ego based material matter.The ""truth"" in doing inner work is the heart of the book.We are all one in spirit and equal where there is spirit there is nothing to judge."
4,Your not ready 4 this,"4 anyone thinkin of gettin this album, i say get it.For hopscotch and freak show.u wont b dissapointed.da drop on freak show is live-youll get any man jumpin,trust me.i remember when i first herd these tracks at 1 of roni size's sets,the first thing i thought woz i gotta get these!and u should 2!"
3,maybe my expectations were set too high...,"From the start, Size sets the mood for this album-a sloppy (at least in his standards) wanna-be jump-up/tech-step album that falls way short of its potential. Mediocre breaks litter this seemingly half-hearted attempt to produce a more mechanized sound. Perhaps I was spoiled by the quality of New Forms, but a lot of these tracks are not even par. Hell, one track is flat out annoying. Granted, there are a few diamonds in there, but there's too much rough to compensate. Go buy New Forms-download this one-it's disposable."
2,Down sized,"Indicative of an artist unwilling or unable to grow, TTE is just too much of a not good enough thing- grimy, uninspired drum and bass electronica."
2,Don't buy if you were hoping to get more Reprazent,"This is just the standard, repetitive, aggressive DnB you can hear anywhere. If you were hoping for the subtlety and rough groovyness of Reprazent, you won't get it here."
5,I LOVED this book!,"I loved this book. Although I would prefer to have an instructor teach me, I live in a remote area and I don't think these classes will ever make it out my way! =(I already have the video (same name/class/etc...) and it's really great. The book reinforced what I learned in the video and had all sorts of motivational information and tips. I just thought it was top drawer!The colors are beautiful, the pictures are too...it was just a real ""girl"" book!Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!"
2,BORING!!!!,"I used to dance for several years while in college...I'm having my third child and was looking for a ""refresher"" and a workout, as I always enjoyed exotic dancing...Well, this book IMO is just so so so basic...Maybe it would be somewhat appropriate for an older woman looking to sex it up a bit, but this is no workout, has no ""moves"" and the most basic boring beauty tips possible...ex...""If u dye ur hair blonde, dont let ur roots show, dark roots are not sexy"" lol....ur better off checking out a vid on youtube..."
1,Phoney Camera for Photo Illiterate n00bs,"This is one of the most worthless cameras Nikon has ever made. It has only 3 focus points, it has no in-body focus motor, and the image sensor is the same one in the D50 and D70/s, which are far superior cameras with 5 focus points and in-body focus motor. Do not buy this worthless piece of junk, or the D60, which is virtually a D40/x.By the way, I've used this camera extensively for street and event photography, and it produces blurry, out-of-focus pictures 50% of the time. Worthless. It also highlights how Ken Rockwell should not be taken all that seriously.This camera is obviously old now, but I still use my D70 and D50 and shoot raw and the D60 collects dust. The D50 only takes 2 GB cards, has a slower buffer for raw, and is 2.5 fps over the 3fps D70 and CF cards, but it's better than the D40/60. The only exception might be the final version of the D40: The D3000, which has 11 focus points."
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased this camera a year and a half ago and have had to send it back twice so far. IT seems to go out right before a special occasion so I have no pictures. I thought I was buying a good quality camera to record all the moments of my child growing up. The first time I had to send it to Nikon, the flash would not deploy, now it will not focus the majority of the time. I took over 30 pictures maybe 1 or 2 were in focus ( I thought automatic meant it would handle everything if I didn't want to be bothered). I am waiting to see how much Nikon will charge me to fix it this time but I am done with Nikon. I did a lot of research and thought I was purchasing a quality product but that is not the case, stay away from this if you want to catch those special moments because that is when it mostly likely will go out on you. i am starting the search again to see which one I will buy now. Hope I don't miss my son's birthday again."
1,very limited lens choise,"if you want a good camara buy the nikon d50 or canon xt this camera do not accept my sigma 18-125mm, nikon 50mm f1.8, and many lens nikon and generic brands, only 3 focus point the nikon d50 have 5 point, not iso100, not exposure and white balance bracketing."
5,Love it!,"I have considered purchasing a DLSR for a couple of years, but it wasn't until my good ol' Sony point-and-shoot with awesome zoom started slowing down that I decided to go for it.I LOVE this camera. I decided on it after talking with a couple of photographer friends and playing with some competing products. The menus on this camera are very intuitive for me.I haven't had a chance to use all of the features yet, but the ones I have used are fantastic!The included lens is an 18-55 mm, so the zoom doesn't even compare to my old digital...until I get another lens, I can live with it, though."
5,I love this item,"This Camera is wonderful it takes awesome pictures and the pictures print out great as wellthey really capture the moment.""a picture you can hold is way more powerful than a picture you can only see"""
5,Great beginner DSLR,"The D40 body and kit lens offer exceptional value for beginers and more experienced photographers transitioning to digital(me). If you have a closet full of old Nikon lenses you want to use, best to move up to a more expensive body that allows them to autofocus. The newer AF-S lenses used on the D40 focus very fast and they are lighter weight than previous series. They will also work on the higher end bodies if you decide to upgrade later. I bought the 18-200 zoom and couldn't be happier with this combo. The included lens also works great. Order the cheap ML-L3 wireless remote and a 52mm UV filter for lens protection."
4,Good camera and lens for the money.,"Bought this camera for my child who is taking photography classes in school. She loves it. It has the look and feel of a real camera with a view finder. Has the abilty to have manual settings other than ""auto"" and it's very light weight."
5,The best serious camera under $450.,"Before buying this Nikon D40 DSLR I've only used compact ""point and shoot"" digital cameras. The jump in quality between the two is amazing. The D40 takes fantastic pictures, especially in low-light situations. Compared to my other cameras, the Canon G10, Canon SD1100, and Sony W-150, the D40 blows them away. It took me about an hour to learn all of the different modes and features, but once I got that down and felt comfortable with the camera I was taking great shots. I tried out the Canon Rebel XS, and the D40 at my local camera shop before buying it here on Amazon, and I was much more impressed with the D40 overall. I highly recommend this camera if you're looking for a cheap DSLR."
3,"So far, not too great.","I have had this camera for a couple of weeks now and am surprised I am not happier with it. The photographs are uniformly harsh in their appearance. I have tried just about every combination of options from all the automatic ones to customizing everything. I have followed suggestions from Ken Rockwell's site and others. In general the colors, especially the greens of grass and vegetation are very unnatural. The contrast also seems too high, but if you lower it at all, the photos become flat. Indoors with the flash, they colors and overall quality seem good. Outdoors, after hundreds of shots, I don't yet have one that is of the quality of my 4 year old 3mp Sony point and shoot. I will keep trying to find the solution as most seem very happy with it, but so far, no luck. It may be that I have a defective one!"
5,A Great Entry Level D-SLR,"I drug my feet for awhile before finally deciding to purchase this camera. I was hung up on the fact it was only 6MP and worried about jumping from the ease of 'Point & Shoot' to something a bit more complicated. All I can say is I am glad I finally did. I am amazed how nice my pictures are turning out. I am already searching for a zoom/telephoto lens to compliment my setup (more research to do).If you are thinking of moving up to a D-SLR for general photography that produces great pictures, then this is the camera for you. I only wish that I had purchased the 2 lense kit, but it wasn't available in the PX at the time."
4,Don't shy away because this is only a 6.1 megapixel camera,"I bought this camera because of the promotion that Amazon was having at the time. The promotion consisted of buy a Nikon camera kit + an extra lens and get $100 off. After my order Amazon decided that the promotion had been incorrectly coded and withdrew the offer. But because the camera had already been shipped, without the extra lens, I was given a very good deal on the just camera kit. Some snafus are a good thing.Even without the deal I am tickled shotless with this camera. It is easy to use, takes accurate pictures and is compact for a DSLR. With the right lenses this can be a decent soccer Mom camera (nikon 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED IF AF-S DX VR Zoom Nikkor Lens, just make sure it is the VR lens)."
2,Shame on Nikon,"I have owned, and still own Nikon equipment since 1965. I have taught Photography for 40 years, I get to see every camera on the market through my adult students ( post college). I recommend Nikon's most often, BUT NOT THIS ONE, camera only focuses with lenses that have a motor within the lens. That renders all ""D"" series lenses obsolete. The Camera has no Depth-of-field preview button which is vital to understanding focus. Kit lens is to ""slow"" to allow you to take a photograph in your kitchen without a flash. Your kitchen is usually the brightest room in your house. Look elsewhere,With photographic equipment, You get what you pay for."
3,If you don't know what to buy NIKON D40 or CANON XT,"Actually I bought Nikon D40, but I found two important reasons for buying Canon instead of Nikon. 1. Canon accessories are cheaper, like lens. 2. When you are going to shoot your D40 you have to look through the viewfinder, you cannot see the picture in the LCD. Canon does. Nikon takes great pictures."
5,good for beginners to DSLR'S,"I really like this camera for learning photography, I've taken some really great shots that I'm proud of and I enjoy the learning process. This camera is great for nature photos too."
4,A nice way to start with SLR,"I'll make it brief since most of the reviews in the internet say mostly what i think. This camera is the perfectway to jump from the point and shoot world to the SLR realm. Im mostly happy to say that once you learn thedifferences between them you'll understand why for some occasions its better to have a point and shoot, and forother occasions you must have the versatility that a DSLR gives you. It's all about the lenses, so take this andbuy yourself a lense that fits your needs and also get that extra flash."
5,"I Love, Love, Love my D40.","I had been reviving my interest in photography recently. When I started thinking about getting a DSLR the D40 had just come out. I was borrowing friends cameras to get a feel for them and to see if I had any preference for Canon or Nikon. I guess you can tell which I liked better. The D40 was a great size and a great price and I figured since it was my first DSLR it would be plenty for me to handle. I debated on a few of the other models, but they were just too much of a cost for me with everything else that I wanted to buy like extra batteries and SD Cards and cases, etc. I was so excited when I recieved my camera. It was very easy to use and the Nikon menu design is great. I really like how they lay it out. I love everything about it. It has become my little baby. I take it with my almost everywhere. It takes such great pictures. I can't wait to get different lenses for it. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves Nikon and is thinking about getting a DSLR."
4,I love it...,"I have used film SLR cameras, but i hated the idea of waiting for pictures to be developed or the hustle of building a dark room... so i decided to buy an entry level dSLR, mostly because i still dont believe you can get the same quality.I love this camera, its fast, its weightless, very good. Buy one... you wont regret it..."
5,Nikon D40 Camera Kit,"The camera has many features that a newbie to SLR cameras will have to master. However, you can take the camera out of the box and shot just like a point-and-shoot without missing a beat. The fast shutter speed helps catch those moments when children are moving at break neck speed and your point-and-shoot is still focusing. A great starter SLR."
4,first higher end camera,"This is the first higher end camera I've owned. The supplied lens in my opinion is low quaility as mine broke the first time I adjusted the zoom level. I couldn't help myself, so I took it apart and repaired it after hearing that the item was no longer in stock. Overall I really like the camera and would suggest it to anyone wanting to upgrade from the handheld on the go cameras like I had in the past."
5,First DSLR,"I was reserching for atleast 3 to 5 months, trying to find out what was the DSLR that suited me best. Until about 1 month ago, I ended up with the Nikon D40, the Canon XSI, and the Sony a200. I used the Canon at Costco, and to be completly honest. I didn't like it all that much. I have a friend with the Sony a200, and its not half bad, its good looking as well. When I went to the local Wal-Mart, and saw the D40, it was perfect. good looking GREAT pictures, and very comfortable. DO NOT be fooled by Megapixels. it is just a way to fool buyers, and make them pay more. i've taken some 20 pics now, and I am satisfied with the croping. and quality is FLAWLESS. Even comparing the pictures of the canon xsi, to the d40's right here on amazon, you can tell, this one does look just as good or even BETTER. I am very very happy with this camara, and I recomend it to anyone on a budget, or starting of like me. Please don't be fooled by MP."
5,Enthusiastic buyer,Nikon D40 6.1MP Digital SLR Camera Kit with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor LensI am very impressed and pleased with my camera. Would reccomend it to another amateur.
5,I'm in love with my Nikon D40,"Setup of my camera went per instructions in the delivered package. I was up and using it the day it arrived. It takes crisp, clean photos. So far, none of the buttons have interfered with my progress. The battery lasts a really long time."
4,Great D-SLR,"This is a great camera for those who don't want to step up and get a D90. I would recommend this D40 instead of D60. Simply because there's not much different between 6MP and 10MP. Are you going to print any photo that larger than a letter-size paper and how often are you going to print? D40 is light enough to carry with you all day and the battery life is great for one whole day of shooting.I think D90 is a great camera with a lot of new technology in itself, including video recording. But this is a digital camera. I would suggest to go ahead and buy D300."
2,Backward compatibility warning!,"It is nice that it is lightweight and is iTTL compatible. I have personally tested exposure with Nikon's Creative Lighting System (CLS) speedlight SB800 and 600.Major con: not backward compatible (for autofocus) with your earlier lenses unless they have their own focusing motor (silent wave motor) such as the lenses provided with it in a kit. While this ""feature"" does save weight off the camera body, none of my other lenses are swm and my kit lens doesn't autofocus most of the time now after 2 years. Can't tell if it's a problem with the camera driving the lens motor or if it's just the lens. What a headache. The megapixels are more than adequate, but spend the extra dollars to get a more versatile body."
5,Wonderful Camera!,Purchased this 6 months ago and I LOVE IT! The pictures are amazing. I still haven't used all of the features and it has plenty. Not a single problem with it.
5,Great camera for a GREAT price,"Purchase this camera for my brother (who loves photography) and he said for the prices this camera has it all. Takes great quality pictures for a great price.Saint Paul, MN"
5,love my D40,"just manna say, i'm very happy with my new camera, i'm new to slr, when i first bought it, i said to my self to forget the programed settings and i'm very pleased with my manual shots i only have it set on manual or aparture and shutter priorties and the results are great, ok not that great but i'm still learning. and yes i'd recommend it to any one!!!!!!"
5,Nikon D40,"The D40 was my first Digital SLR and I love it. I have used D50's and D80's but i like the D40 the best. It is smaller and lighter. Some people complain about the 6.0MP but I never print my photos larger than 15 inches so it is not a problem with me. I not sure how well all the presets work because I usually shoot in ""M"" (full manual mode) but on occasion in ""P"" (programed automatic). When shooting in ""P"" the camera does seem to over expose a little, so click the f-stop down two clicks and that fixes the exposure. This over exposure problem might be true in all the modes, I'm not sure. It is a very sturdy camera I love the large Screen. The built in flash is also extremely nice if you sync it correctly. If you know how to shoot in manual mode this camera is amazing; it is a great camera for so many people because of its cheap cost and ease of useFilm is still my favorite but for a DSLR the D40 is a great camera.Hope this helps."
4,Great camera,"This is a great camera, it takes good pictures and I love how it captures the colors. It's more than fast enough to take pictures of fast subjects such as two three month old puppies. It would be nice if it had a way to preview the changes made to aperture, but I'm getting a sense of what aperture and shutter speed works without the preview. Some people who have used my camera think that it doesn't feel heavy enough either, but I actually find that makes it easier to use. It's probably a good idea to go to the store and try holding one before you decide if that is going to bother you or not. The settings are also pretty easy to use after you get used to them, easier than my parents point and shoot canon."
5,Great camera for casual photographer like me,"I love this camera. It is pretty small, can do everything you'd expect from a quality SLR etc. I am sure it isn't as durable as more expensive cameras, and its lack of an AF motor in the camera body might scare off people using older lenses and stuff, and obviously its sensor is much smaller than a top-of-the line model...but if you want a (big) step up from a compact digital camera, you won't be disappointed in this one.Also, do read reviews from people who know what they're talking about regarding megapixels vs. sensor size. There are pretty good sounding arguments for buying this one as opposed to the D40x. Having not compared the two I cannot vouch for one over the other based on experience, but the reviews I read convinced me this one was the better choice for me and I really haven't been at all disappointed."
4,I love this camera!,"My only complaint is the weight and size of the camera body-- it is certainly smaller than some of the higher end 'professional models,' but i was led to believe by the photos and other reviews that this would be a compact little dslr, which it really isn't. But it's great. Takes great macro shots, and is ready to go out of the box (after you attach the lens, of course). Also great that different lenses can be used. I have yet to explore it's full potential, but i'm happy with my purchase."
3,Everything is good but the shutter error,"I had this camera for a few months. Everything is good until the error message ""Error, press the button to release the shutter again"" appears every time I take a picture. I have to push the button at least three times to take one picture now. Sometimes even worse: the error message just keeps coming and I can never take one in some mode. The problem made me missed a lot of good shots. Since this error message is included in the list of errors on the manual, I guess Nikon is aware of this problem but did not get a chance to fix it?I would have loved this camera a lot if it does not have such problem."
5,Impecable,"It arrived extremely quickly, packaging is like brand new with all pieces included. Camera works extremely well and is just like it is brand new. I am so impressed and happy with this purchase. THank you!"
3,Defective Lens?,"I got my D40 last Friday and took many shots. Some of the Image Quality is superb unfortunately it is not consistent. The autofocus don't seem to work. I get about 5 great pictures, out of ten. I don't know if it is just me because this is my first DSLR camera but I have tried all the manual settings as well as auto mode but I still get bad pictures. I zoomed to the 55mm max and the image quality is just poor. I am really disappointed because I know that the D40 is a superb entry level DSLR. I really think the lens is defective. The auto focus works most of the time but not all the time. It is really hard to manually focus on this lens especially on Macro and max zoom. I wll return this to amazon and exchange it for the Canon EOS Rebel XS."
4,Nikon D40,Great camera and simple to use. Reliable Nikon quality. Quick delivery from Amazon and packed well.
3,Garden Tool Set,"The tool set is very cheaply made. You get what you pay for, since it doesnt cost much. Im wishing I had bought a nicer one though, that might hold up a little longer. Idk how long this one will last."
