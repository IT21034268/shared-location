4,Solid and authentic,This is fantastic film and $20 well spent. Great footage from the forward thinking (while still ramshakle) TV Party show. Not much regarding extras but about an hour and a half of great happenings. I bought this when I saw a young-ish Robert Fripp (of King Crimson) performing with a piecemeal band that included Chris Stein from Blondie on guitar. Awesome stuff.
3,horror rock,it dont suck but the background vocals do. out of the grave and into the dark is better.
3,Better bring your charger!!!,"I loved this camera at first. After about a year though, the charge just would not hold. Excellent camera besides that. Just be sure that if you plan on taking more than 10 pictures, have your charger ready to plug back into the wall. Then within minutes, it'll show that it is completely charged again, yet within taking only a few more pictures the red screen will show, ""Battery too Low to take Pictures"". I think I will get a new camera this Christmas."
3,Look out for HP Products!!!!!!,"Bought an HP Photosmart R717 in the summer of 2005 for $324.74. 4 months after the camera warranty was up and after minimal usage the camera was displaying: 0000000F-10FB-1BD-024 Error Message, on the display screen.When I called HP about getting my camera repaired I was told that it would be too expensive to repair. I was informed it would cost around $200.00 dollars to receive most likely a refurbished replacement camera, with only a 3-month warranty.After trying the replacement camera for 15 days I was then to send my old camera back as partial payment for the replacement camera.I told HP no thanks, because they had already gotten enough money from me."
4,HP R725 6.2MP,"Very easy to use camera that takes solid pictures. This camera allows for zooming and has sound while taking video. I like that you have the option of cliping pictures out from the video clips. This allows for some humerous pictures. I really like this camera.I did have a problem with the zoom button 2 months after buying the camera and after about a month of not using the camera. I had to press the button really hard for it to zoom. I called Amazon to take back the product but they were not very helpful with informing me how much money they would refund me or how I can take it to HP if it were under warantee.All in all, the camera is very usable and I plan on keeping it and have not had any other problems with the camera."
2,Would not recommend,"I received this camera for my birthday in March. I exchanged it 2 days later because the battery would not hold a charge. The second one lasted until about 2 weeks ago (so approx. 3 months). This time the camera would turn itself on when it was just sitting on the counter and turn itself off when I tried to take a picture. Very weird. Anyway, I have been trying to return it to Target again, but every Target in my area seems to be out of them. So I have decided that I am going to try something else. I seem to have no luck with HP cameras, the last one I owned (before the R725) just decided to die on the day of my sons 3rd birthday party. I believe the problem with the R725 does not lie with the camera itself, but with the battery. It would be a great camera if the battery would be better."
5,great,"thsi video is great its a strong work out, there are less strenuous options for various conditioned mothers. If you do it often and with cardio you will stay in shape."
3,Whew,"I do enjoy this video. My baby does also. It's a lot harder then I had anticipated, but that's probably a good thing. The only problem is that i had never done any pilates before so I didn't know about the ""pilates breathing techniques"" and such. But I do enjoy it. I bought it when my baby was almost 2 months, he's 3 now, and he really enjoys it :)"
2,Ouch!,"The instructor says that this is safe for c-section moms, but I tried today for the first time (I'm 7.5 weeks postpartum) and had to stop after five minutes, it really hurt my abs and I'm just not there yet! I was able to do hundreds on my own, but not with an 11 pound baby on my lap, squirming!The video moved pretty quickly as well and she didn't explain things well (again, only got through five minutes or so), I'll be looking for a better postnatal workout DVD."
2,Not effective,This DVD is way too short. It only gives a few exercises that you could have figured out without the help of the tape. I enjoy the Mommy and Me workout more. It has more exercises and you actually feel like your getting a workout. This DVD was uneffective.
3,Short workout,"This is a good workout for those of you who wants to try pilates and doesn't already have a pilates DVD. I bought this postnatal pilates DVD thinking it will be different than my regular pilates DVD. However, the exercises are the same as the ones on my regular pilates except it has one set of squats and one set of exercise to work your arms. The workout involves the baby by putting the baby on your lap during exercises like the hundreds and rollups. You work your arm by lifting the baby up and down. The squats are done by holding the baby close to your body. The baby is put aside for part the workout. This DVD is a waste of money for me because I could've used my regular pilates DVD and put my baby on my lap."
4,Good for a quick workout that involves the baby,"I just received this DVD and did it with my baby for the first time this morning. Yes, it's short and doesn't have any chapters (which is annoying). But the short length of the workout is actually a positive for me because it's not so intimidating that I don't even want to start. Also, I love the fact that it really involves the baby and considers his needs as well as the mom's. My baby is 10 weeks old and really liked it. Of course, if you are familiar with the exercises already, I suppose you could figure out on your own how to involve the baby, but personally I find it comforting to have a video devoted to my needs as a new mom. Some of the moves are really hard, but fortunately there are alternative positions for us beginners (they're hard to see though--just a small inset in the corner of the screen). I'm really looking forward to doing this workout many times with my baby."
3,Good place to start getting back in shape,"I bought this DVD to get back in some kind of shape after the birth of my first baby. I had been on bedrest for 10 weeks prenatal and didn't have the confidence to go straight back to exercise classes without taking some time to get in better shape at home first.I like how the DVD involves Baby to some degree, because it made exercise more approachable. There were 1 or 2 exercises I had to struggle with at first, which wasn't necessarily a negative for me as it gave me something to shoot for. In some places, the soundtrack seems to be a little off from the video, so you have to choose between listening and watching to follow along. Also, you can't fast forward through all the talking at the beginning because there are no chapters. Despite these problems, I found what I was looking for (an exercise program that I could do with my 4 month old to get back on track with weight loss and fitness) in this DVD."
3,Okay... but short and not for beginners,"The total work out time for this DVD is 20 minutes and as a pilates novice, hard to follow. For such a short DVD it seems quite rushed and doesn't explain positions very well.Although, the interaction with my 12 week old is wonderful."
3,Not For Beginners,"This may be a good workout if you're already proficient at pilates, but if not, very little is explained and it can be fairly difficult to keep up. I also found it quite difficult to integrate my baby as the workout allows for, and for many of the exercises she just has her baby laying on the floor beside her, so not everything is done with your baby.If, like me, you're looking into pilates to strengthen your core after pregnancy, I highly recommend Sarah Picot's Beginning level More Than Mat Pilates. It's actually easier to do and is fully explained. Perhaps now that I've done that one a few times I could try her Postnatal one again and see if it is more doable."
4,Lost,"I've used this product in the past and know it's great, however this item got lost so never had a chance to use it :("
4,Not Bad,"Old faces (Hackney, Gracie, Jennum) along with new up-and-comers (Severn, Mezger) complete a great field of fights. This UFC has everything from bone cringing groin shots (Hackney/Son) to acrabitic Suplexes (Severn, Macias) along with a pretty good dramatic final."
1,Don't purchase this item without reading this review first!,"I purchased this item from a store about two weeks ago, and it diid cost $120.00, well the next day I wanted to see if this outragiously priced case would actually work, so I tested, I dropped it with an older model iPaq I own, and when it hit the ground, the screen went off, I picked it up and shook it. All I could hear was rattling from the compaq, so I tried to turn it on, wouldn't turn on. It was completely destroyed, all the components in it had fallen off the circuit board. So I would just like to let you know, buyer beware."
1,Demasiando grande y exagerado,"Cuando lo ordene creia, segun lo que se ve en la foto del site, que era algo comodo, pero para mi sorpresa el tama√±o fue muy voluminoso, exagerado, y fuera de toda ergonomia.Lo que parece este objeto es como algo para ir a bucear...No lo recomiendo para alguien que sea ejecutivo y que este buscando proteccion para su iPAQ sin sacrificar el estilo, portabilidad, y ergonomia."
4,a must own dvds,"Man two movies in one thing for a great price cant go wrong thier wow, paul newman is way cooler than tom cruise but both have great acting skills, yeah"
5,Good animal,"Got it for girlfriend, because she is in college and it looks exactly like her dog at home. She loves it!"
5,So Cute!!,"I have collected Douglas Plush for a while, and this Border Collie is definitely one of my favorites! It is really durable, and I have washed it several times, on the gentle cycle, and it turned out fine! It is super cute too too, and just the right size!"
4,Pretty authentic looking,"This is a cute stuffed border collie, however...............the description indicated it was machine washable, but the tag said ""surface-washable"". When buying something online, all you can do is go by how it is described, so I find it disconcerting when those ""facts"" aren't accurate. I will advise the recipient (it was bought as a gift) that another reviewer machine washed putting it in a pillow case, and it came out alright. It helps to have that input."
5,"douglas border collie, plush",Very sweet plush dog. My daughter loves it. The ears have small wired frame so u can move them into position for added character. Timely arrival.
2,"Lots of loves for this, but begins to look bad really fast","I gave this to our 2 year old daughter for Christmas and it overtook her 'lovey bear', which now sits neglected on her dresser lol. She absolutely LOVES this ""doggy"" and its everything I can do to just give him a bath. In spite of all the loves, however, its hair has matted most spectacularly, and we already have a hole wearing in it's front left armpit, and we only gave it to her not six months ago. It starts off adorable, and in spite of being machine washable, I wouldn't recommend it if you like it's hair the way it is. I heard someone put theirs in a pillowcase before washing it, and maybe that makes the difference. My experience is it will be much loved, no matter what, but if you like your kid carrying around a fluffy border collie, and not one that looks like it's in a constant state of a bad hair day, I'd go for the meadow border collie or one of the other shorter haired plushes."
2,Wheels like toy,"Wheels like toy, June 21, 2007I bought this for my best friend paying delivery handling charge to Korea as much as this stroller. But it was turned not to be worthy at all.My friend said that she really liked it except wheels like toy. It could be said almost plastic so that she couldn't take it outside her apartment because they are not firm. She is planing to use it when she moves her dogs to the basement for driving.The stroller originally should be made not only for elevator and corridor but for outside. But this product didn't satisfy the basic feature and so disappointing."
4,"Christopher, Klaus, Cushing and Kojack! Great Three for ONE!","VESTAGES FROM THE VINTAGE VAULT!Vintage Entertainments three for one installments of the greats - Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Klaus Kinski and Kojack (Telly Savalas) in REMASTERED EDITIONS OF ""The Satanic Rites Of Dracula"", ""Horror Express"" and ""Jack The Ripper""!All of these films are excellent in their own right. ""Jack The Ripper"" is a great view with Jack killing women in lieu of payback to his prostitute mother who abused him.Satanic cults and vampirism abound in Christopher Lee's ""The Satanic Rites Of Dracula"".All aboard the trans-Siberian ""Horror Express"". Complete with a frozen in time MONSTER that just MIGHT be the Missing Link!Great movies at a great price!Happy Watching!"
2,Lincoln-fact or fiction,The dvd came in time agreed and is in great shape. I was disappointed in the content of the dvd-not its shape. It was short and neither confirmed or proved anything.
5,Perfect Album!,"Any one who ever practiced yoga at some point in his/her life should concider buying this album.Four tracks that takes us listeners into a wonderland of total relaxation.This album is a perfect companion to your yoga practise, it will ease the mind and thaught, and will calms all of your senses.An Amazing album."
2,not crazy about this one,"im sure its just my preference, the music is well played, its just not beneficial to me and i have stopped using this cd."
4,Intoxicating,"I've tried too many ""new-age"" CDs - and have felt pretty darn silly. Invariably I'm annoyed that I've been duped. So much so, that I recently decided to simply go back to the source and quietly play (certain) Indian classical music and eliminate synthesizers and echo from my practice. That being said, I STILL purchased this CD on a whim. I was really amazed and happy by how lucky I had been this time. This CD is absolutely captivating and intoxicating. Seems like the best (from my perspective) for its intended purpose. It will be a long time before I grow weary of it. Thanks to the other reviewers for encouraging its purchase."
4,Spirit of Yoga,I really enjoy this yoga music! It is long and continuous which allows me to practice without losing concentration.
3,Adequate,"The cleaning cloth was much smaller than I was anticipating - when comparing to those sold by other companies. It does, however, do a good job cleaning silver so it does what it is supposed to do."
2,'Could've' been but wasn't.,"I had really looked forward to this movie, but for the first half hour or so I was lost, whafted back and forth in confusion, until it started to reveal the story for what it was. It tried, oh it tried, it could've been a winner, but it wasn't.I think they should have given 'William' the ghost more of a part than a piano playing ghost who had about 10 lines in the movie near the end. And the premise of William could have been a story in itself...but no, he simply tried to explain all the ghosts haunting the place as being one soul...really dumb.Don't get me wrong, I like all the talent in this movie. Well acted, by all, but the story, oh the story, if only, if only, if only...."
2,Started out okay and then fizzled,"This movie started out well enough, with a mother and her moody teen daughter escaping for the summer to a rented house, where the daughter soon meets a young man that only she can see. She also goes to her shrink because she had made a suicide attempt. Then she appears to be a sort of magnet for the spirits of the dead, including a woman she used to know, some old guy, some older woman.......By that point it gets so hard to follow that there really isn't much point in going on. Too bad, because the actors were good enough, and the photography and visual effects were quite good for a low budget feature."
2,Two star supernatural drama,"This is a ghost story, a supernatural drama. It is not a thriller. It is not science fiction.Langley (X-Files), Diana Troy (Star Trek Next Generation) and Commodore Ross (Space Above and Beyond) are the ""stars"" used to get you to watch the film. David Hedison is from Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. That is on DVD but don't rent it. Watch a clip on Youtube and then just leave it be.These actors will appeal to Science fiction fans which is why it is listed as a science fiction movie.The dialog and acting are pretty weak. The whole movie is After School Special dull. I found the story telling and pace to be fair. The way they handle the ghosts was novel enough. This is a 2 of 5 star movie that I did not mind watching."
3,Spectres Movie,"I was a bit disapointed in this movie, however I bought this because of Marina Sirtis and Linda Park. I'm a fan of both of these women, Marina Sirtis as Deanna Troi from Star Trek the next generation, and Linda Parks from Star Trek Enterprise. The Star Trek ladies are the reason for this purchase. This movie is still OK. If you are a star trek fan then you should buy this movie."
3,INTERSTING MOVIE,HEY IT IS AN INTERESTING MOVIE I AM FRENCH THERE IS NO SUBTITTLES BUT I ANDERSTAND ALMOST EVERYTHING SO IT LOOK LIKE A TELE MOVIE BUT WITH VERY ATTRACTINGS TRACKS I DON T WANT TO TELL WHAT HAPPEN HERE BUT IF YOU LIKE GHOST STORYS AND MOVIES WITH GOOD CARACTERS AS MOVIES LIKE VIRGIN SUICIDE OR GHOST STORYS YOU MAY LIKE THIS ONE IT WAS NOT BORING AT ALL BUT IS NOT ALSO THE MOVIE OF THE YEAR ALL RIGHT FOLKS???
5,Great preschool toy!,"Bought this for my 3 year old last year, and my 18 month old loves playing with the ""peoples"". Very unique, and great to see something aimed at Jewish children to counter all of the Christmas toys. Bought other sets for my son's preschool teachers and for Hanukkah gifts. The response was fantastic. Even my sons grandmother saw it and tracked it down through a fischer price customer service number!. A great toy."
5,Outstading!,"one of the Christmas gifts my daughter continually plays with, has a bit of everything in here!"
4,SAME MOLD NEW COLOR,"The exact same mold with a different paint scheme from the original Cybertron Optimus Prime released in 2005.Optimus has given up his Aubot Symbols with the 4 symbols of the Cyber (Planet) Keys and changing his classic Red and Blue for a much darker red and Black with a hint of silver and some gold to give him an ""Updated"" look.All his transformation and abilities remain the same, and all his special powerlinx abilities remain as the previous mold. So he can be linked to Leobreaker and WingSaber."
2,Greatly Disappointed,"I have a copy of the book I ordered that was so enjoyable to my grandson when he was small. But my copy was well worn and I wanted a good copy for my great grandson. The online description sounded like what I wanted but the price seemed high. When I received the book, it was almost as worn as my copy and the price was terribly high for a little child's small book in this condition. If I sold all the children's books I own at such an inflated price, I would be wealthy!"
4,Body Glove Reliance Professional Silicone Diving Mask,"I've only used this mask in a swimming pool. I bought it for a Caribbean snorkeling trip I'll be taking next month. This mask is an incredible value at less than $17. I have a small narrow face and my husband has a big wide face and this mask fits both of us just fine. Only a couple drops of water come into to the mask when I wear it. This has happened with other masks I've worn and doesn't interfere with my snorkeling. If I lived near the ocean and snorkeled often, I would probably buy a more expensive mask. But since I'll only use this for a few days and it works great, it is a good deal for me."
1,Horrible condition.,"Gave 1 star as it would not allow me to give 0 stars for review. It had watermarks all over the front and back covers. Booger type stuff all iside HORRIBLE CONDITION! I am glad this person used this book. I was given this book when my son died, and wanted to give it to my friend who lost her granddaughter. I ordered it from a Family Christian Bookstore. Couldn't believe Amazon would allow such a badly used book to be bought."
1,Worst Grief Book Ever,"We received this book as a gift to help us when my sister was killed in a car accident. It was horrible. It was not comforting; it read like a dry, overwrought church sermon and focused on trite, typical Biblical promises of ""the hereafter."" We had expected to find a Christian book that was understanding and deep, like C.S. Lewis' books on grief have continued to be for us. Instead, we got a generic sermon-like tome about Jesus' resurrection and what ""paradise"" might be like, wrapped in a title that sounds like it will actually help you. Horrendous."
2,DISAPOINTED,TOO MUCH FOR 3 SONGS U MIGHT AS WELL BUY VOL 3 THE SUBLIMINAL VERSES THEN GO ONTO ITUNES AND BUY THE THIRD SONG FOR A BUCK. THAT WOULD COST WAY LESSTHE SONGS ARE GOOD THOUGHJUST A WASTE OF TIME
2,No recommended,"It suffers from the modern trend of editing the bloody thing so fast that you'll suffer a headache. Also, amazing Blaze guitarists Wray and Slater are gone. (although the guitar work in the new album THE MAN WHO WOULD NOT DIE is very good). Buy at your own risk"
3,Uh-oh,Blaze is excellent...slightly deranged the way we like him. The drummer is truly awful and the Zakk Wylde clone can't play like Zakk Wylde (check out the butchered Silicon Messiah and Man On The Edge). Looking forward to another DVD from Blaze with a better band (which he now has - two of whom are on this DVD and are fine). For definitive Blaze Bayley get The Man Who Would Not Die.
3,More like 3.5,"I know many or most of you were planning on buying this cd from hearing the song California. This would be a big mistake and I would highly recommend taking a listen to some of the songs before buying. The rest of the cd sounds nothing like California, which was a very catchy rock song. The songs that follow are catchy as well but are different in that there is this 60's pop rock feel to them, though most of the songs are completely unique from each other. There are some great songs like #2-#4 but you must keep an open mind and not expect more rockin California songs. The reason this cd received a lower score is that after you listen to it about 6 times it is just boring and nothing to keep you interested."
5,Awesome,"Phantom Planet's ""The Guest"" provides a mix of different tunes. It's independent music at it's best.Hopefully after the use of ""California"" in ""The O.C."" their music will become more main stream, allowing more people to experience their greatness.Some of the better songs:. California,Anthem,In Our Darkest Hour,Turn Smile Shift Repeat."
3,reminds me of travis...,i bought this album last night at an incubus concert...phantom planet really rocked live and they did a meet and greet so i thought they were cool enough and bought their album. i was pretty surprised. i was expecting poppy punk stuff..or loud rock..but they remind me more of travis and coldplay or radiohead more than anyone else..i don't know..does anyone else hear that? it's pretty good..not the best music i have ever heard but it's definetely a nice souviner and they really did ROCK live. i swear.
2,DON'T BUY THIS CD,"I hate to criticize people, but I have to be honest about this record to spare others from wasting their money. This album is terrible . Each song is more self-absorbed than the next and no song is even remotely musically or lyrically profound. I'm convinced that Phantom Planet writes their lyrics based on what they do that day, for example:I woke up really sad/Then I took a showa/I hope I get through the day/So I can have a better one tommoraaaaa... you get the idea.But it's not only the vapid and ridiculous lyrics I have a problem with, it's also the *** of the songs. I can tolerate stupid lyrics if they are on top of some catchy melodies, but this album also lacks catchy melodies! I hate to be so harsh, but I need to be harsh for my message to break through . This band is not like Weezer or the Strokes in any way, meaning they lack musical talent and songwriting skills. So, if you are looking for something Weezeresque, look elsewhere."
1,BUSCH LEAGUE!!,"This album is the epitome of a could've-done-better release. The group does capture the importance of catchy, foot-tapping songs and exploits these qualities, readily. Overall, though, Phantom Planet is like a fantastic idea that was poorly-executed. Laziness shows through, as does a dependence on studio effects, and track layering..."
2,DON'T BUY THIS CD,"This album is terrible. Each song is more self-absorbed than the next and no song is even remotely musically or lyrically profound. However, it's not the vapid and ridiculous lyrics I have a problem with, but also the crapiness of the songs. I can tolerate stupid lyrics if they are on top of some catchy melodies, but this album also lacks catchy melodies! Sorry Phantom Planet, but you are not that good."
3,"Doesn't ROCK, and they SHOULD!","California is a deceptively catchy song. It sticks in your head, although it appears to have little to say lyrically. But after having seen the band a few times, I have to say the record is a bit clean and wimpy. Mitchell Froom has made some great records but he's not the producer for a rock band. These guys should sound like the bands they obviously worship. Instead they are recorded like a folk-rock band. The rest of the record is also basically forgettable. It's still not clear they are more than what we know they are; actors playing the part of a rock band.Their influences are in the right place; but those influences wouldn't have made such a controlled, tepid record.What were they afraid of?"
4,RETURN OF ROCK !!!!,"It's about time for all of this M-TV concocted junk to just disappear. No more trashy-looking teen divas or bling bling rappers. No more tortured wanna-be messiah rock gods posing from mountain tops. These guys play rock and roll, very poppy rock and roll I might add. Plus their drummer was in ""Rushmore"", how cool is that? Buy this album, or keep on listening to the trash that M-TV plays, it's up to you."
5,These boys can do no wrong,"The first few chords in ""California"" is just the begining of one of the bset albums I've heard all year. The (dare I say it?) early Beatles esque one ray of sunlight seals the deal. This band knows what it's doing. Not to mention the hopeful, up-beat story ""Anthem"". My personal favorite, the angry, yet somehow still punky and peppy ""In our Darkest hour"". The whole album is just song after song of cheery, emotion packed lyrically aware music not seen since the days of Weezer's Blue Album. Don't bother looking up a boy band and wasting your money on that [stuff]. Do what's right and buy this album, now!"
4,Goes Down Easy,"At this point, Phantom Planet are known primarily as that band with the drummer (Jason Schwartzman) who starred in Rushmore. With The Guest, their sophomore effort, they prove to be more than the sum of their indie-film credentials. (Singer Alex Greenwald was also in last year's Donnie Darko.) This tuneful quintet is reminiscent of prime Kinks and any number of power pop combos through the ages (Raspberries, The Knack, Travis, Saves the Day, etc.). At this point in their young career, they're more concerned with the felicities of love, and the ambiguous thrills of stardom. That's as it should be. Even their brightest corners, however, are dusted with melancholy, lending these buoyant poptunes enough gravitas to stick to the ribs as they go down easy."
4,Pop-Rock that isn't selling out,"I bought this CD after hearing about Phantom Planet a couple times in a magazine that doesn't exist anymore (""Jump"" if your curious) and seeing them at a festival concert near me and for only knowing the song ""California"" at the time, I was very impressed by their performance and their music. I instantly got this CD the next day.I must say that their music does remind me of early-mid Beatles music, there are poppy cutesy love songs then there are really deep intrinsic songs that even incorporate orchestras (""Wishing Well"" is by far my favorite song), Alex even sounds like Paul McCartney on the last track of the CD. This is a perfect CD for summer and ""California"" just screams road-trip ( i know that's an obvious concept.) Very high reccomendation for summer (i've had it for a year and i never listened to it in the winter but now i listen to it all the time and it was the same thing last summer.)"
3,This album is like a &#65533;Pop Through the Decades Review&#65533;,"Phantom Planet can't seem to figure out what they want to be. Are they a retro-British-Invasion band? Are they a pure pop band? Are they a rock band? I have no idea. All of these styles are present on their 2nd release, The Guest. There are a lot of good songs here, particularly the quirky, hook-laden opener, ""California"". ""Turn Smile Shift Repeat"" is pure druggy psychadelica straight out of 1968 and ""Nobody's Fault"" might as well be a long lost Dave Clark Five record. The band does a good job handling these disparate stylings and each song stands alone as a solid piece of pop craftsmanship, but the overall effect is unsatisfying. This album is like a ""Pop Through the Decades Review"". You know you enjoyed it, but later you can't remember what you heard."
4,"Solid Music, Some Odd Choices","My friend and I share similar musical taste (Weezer and Jimmy Eat World to name a few) and when he recommended Phantom Planet, I had to buy The Guest. I liked nearly all of the songs on the CD, and I think it's a solid compilation of tunes. However, I think they made some odd choices in the placement of the songs. For example, I think they should've put 'Anthem' very last instead of slapping it right before 'In Our Darkest Hour', 'Turn, Smile, Shift, Repeat', and others, which I think overshadows 'Anthem'. Overall, 4 out of 5 stars - a good CD."
3,A Phigment of My Imagination,"I heard ""California"" a few times, and downloaded it, and could not get it out of my head. I love that...song. It's catchy, it's a road song, it's good. I decided I had to have the CD, so I got it cheap at [a local store]. I must say, I'm a little less than thrilled. The first four, or maybe five songs are great ""Lonely Day"" has an unshakable hook. After that it just isn't right. something about the album makes it seem bleak and uninteresting. It may not ""explore darker themes"" but it's not a very happy record either. It's hard to put my finger on exactly why I don't like it too much, but do this: LISTEN TO IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT and just maybe just download the good songs. These guys are capable of better things than this."
4,NOT Dot and the Kangaroo,"This is not the movie ""Dot and the Kangaroo"" as another review might lead one to believe (like me!). That movie only seems to be available via auction. This is the sequel and gets four stars because it wasn't what we thought it would be. It does have great non-cartoon scenery mixed with the images."
2,"Wonderful book, unforgivable, shoddy binding","I'll start by saying that this is a lovely tribute to the most invisible, versatile and ubiquitous font. It is a full bled chunk of photography and unintentional wit.Buuuttt....The binding is absolutely horrendous. I'm not referring to the imaginative use of perforation, either. The binding completely fell apart after flipping through it once. The pages are not folded and stitched and only held in with apparently inadequate adhesive. I am now the proud owner of a nice stack of loose paper.Due to the fact that the reader is expected to separate the perforated edges- the book becomes non-refundable.So, although I wish I could recommend this little book due to content I strongly advise that you not purchase it."
5,Great book!,"I really like the book. It's a comprehensive showcase for one of the most controversial typeface. This tiny book holds numerous artwork (many of them are quintessential pieces) designed by both well-trained designers and amateurs, as well as debating quotes, throughout the decades. The collection of logos is also quite interesting.Again, and as always, Helvetica didn't speak just for itself here. At least, it also spoke of Graphic Design as a discipline. Wonderful, brilliant and impressive; both the book and the typeface."
3,dont open it!,"My binding also fell apart the second time I flipped through it. I loved the book, but the binding is just terrible."
4,A skier's evaluation,"This is basically a technical book for instructors, BUT, a handicapped skier can benefit by reading the section that pertains basically to their situation. Also it is a confidence builder to know there are people out there who really know their stuff and are not just there for the Buck$."
3,Adaptive Teaching,A good reference book! A little out of date but still a very good source book for teaching adaptive skiing. Good disability definations and review of meds. A handy book to have if you are studing for Level 1 exams.
5,An outstanding introduction to economics.,"I don't normally bother reviewing textbooks, but this one was so good I felt compelled to. I had absolutely no background in economics, but this book explained the concepts and the principles underlying them so clearly that I picked the topic up very easily. Not only is it very clear, but it's very well-written and presents its information in a creative and sometimes even entertaining way.Even though I'm not going to be taking Macroeconomics in college at all, I'm still planning to buys Mankiw's Macroeconomics book, too. His microeconomics book has made me want to learn more about a topic I previously had no interest in!"
2,Silberberg's 4th Edition much much better,"The 4th Edition of the Principles of Microeconomics by Eugene Silberberg, which I can't find on Amazon.com, is much much better at teaching the underlying issues. Mankiw can't resist interjecting personal political views (blatantly conservative) any chance he has. While Silberberg can hardly be classified as anything but conservative based on his writing, he emphasizes facts over politics, a lesson that Mankiw needs to learn."
3,Saved me a ton of money..,"I am happy with the condition of this textbook. Since it's paperback, it shows its wear but I don't mind because of the savings."
4,Improved Battery!,I've been using my CF+ for 5 days & everything work fine. I like the improvement on battery & the cover. I'm using a 3630 iPAQ. I read alot of horror stories about the CF+ but I took the dive & bought it because I badly needed the extra battery time. I'm really glad I did.
1,Waste of cash,"Bought it on the hope it would work with the iPAQ 5555 I still have.Doesn't matter what I place in it. Memory card, CF format expansion, just does not work.Only redeeming quality is that it has a built in cover for the screen."
1,"stinks, dont think about buying it","First of all, you have to pay 99.99$ for it. Then after you buy it you have to spend another 50.00$ on buying things that work with it. it does nothing accept sits there,......I bought it, belive me"
2,Review for Hard to Place: A Crime of Alchohol,"This book takes you through the actual life events of someone suffering from Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and how it affects family and friends. This amazing true story shows how a loving and caring mother attempts to raise her adopted son without the knowledge of his biological past. Having known her son as a loving and compassionate human being, reading Dr. Norgard's book helped me understand the affects of FAS.I would highly recommend that anyone read this book, whether or not you know someone suffering from this preventable brain damage."
5,Hard to Place - hard to put down,"Hard to Place:a Crime of Alcohol is a heart-wrenching true story of a devoted mother's futile efforts to find help for her lovable but difficult adopted son. After he commits a terrible crime, her desperate crusade to save his life, leads to the shocking discovery that the seeds of his crime were planted long before his birth. All women of childbearing age, all parents, all of society, must be made aware of the devastating effects and the complete preventability of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. This book is a must read."
5,Powerful & Important,"This book covers so much ground in an easy to read, fast paced style. As a personal account of a mother's courage and love, it is heart breaking and honest. As a look into to the criminal justice system, fetal alcohol syndrome, and the death penalty, it is powerful and important. It is a story that shares lessons vital to each one of us."
5,Courage and Compassion,"Hard to Place is a riveting, heart-wrenching, real story about real people. Dr. Norgard's writing is clear and easy to follow, and thus the impact of her story is all the more alarming. She takes the reader with her on her journey from the joy and omnipotentiality of young motherhood to the disbelief of tragedy, to her soul searching retreat to Nepal, and back again to putting her pain into action. Her passion is contagious, the love of her friends and family is inspirational, and her devotion to children yet unborn reminds the reader that the world's children belong to all of us, and each of us have a responsibility to each other. This story, then, is ultimately a love story, a story of unconditional love in its purest form."
3,Good Book,I read this book mostly because I work in the field of Adoption and wanted to see the account of the long term effects of FAS. My heart aches for the family. I feel the book itself was poorly edited but I still couldn't put it down.
1,Not a good deal is you have battery problems,"I bought this battery pack in hopes of extending the life of my Compaq Ipaq 3635. The battery now holds a charge for less that a minutes, and dies. I received this battery pack, only to find out that it requires the Expansion Pack Plus to work. That means, it cost nearly $150 to replace a poor battery, if you include the cost of the Expansion Pack Plus, plus a slimline battery.Unless you own the Expansion Pack Plus, don't buy this. Either change PDAs, or get a do-it-yourself install kit for the internal battery on the IPAQ."
1,too little info provided to order,"I received this battery pack, only to find out that it requires the Expansion Pack Plus to work. Nothing in the write-ups indicated this. Now I have a battery pack with no place to connect it. Now ... I have to figure out how to return it ... sigh."
3,I found the title a misnomer,"I found the book to be more of an ""Outside and Around the LRRPs"". Other than two very short personal accounts of LRRP operations, the book presents a history of LRRP type operations going back to 1675. Although well researched, I was looking for more tactical, personal accounts of LRRP missions in Vietnam rather than a description of the type of man, his training and equipment, and how the LRRPs fit into the Department of the Army's organizational structure."
3,Well written,"The first half of this work can be difficult, as we slip with Joseph in and out of his visions. However, Hawke's writing is deft and his discriptions vivid. The only complaint I can offer is the resolution is perhaps a bit too trite compared to the bulk of the book."
2,below average,I have a 45xx series IPAQ and itgoes into the case but it is lose. So how much protection offered is in question.
4,A very interesting and very helplful read....,"Just not worht 5 stars, it is a little redudant. However, I agree it provides some interesting information. Some of the techniques seem bizarre but plausible. I would recommend this book highly."
5,More great surf music,A return to great surfing sounds with more reverb guitar and thedistinctive drums with a touch of sax.Proves to be a winning combination.
4,good surf,"Good sounding surf music and also good vocals. I don't know of any hits on, but good music and good all around C.D."
3,Will the 1965 film be letterboxed?,"This 3 star review is misleading. I haven't seen this new collection,yet. I'm hoping that Disney fixed the 1965 version which they previously released fullscreen. I hope it's now letterboxed. It probably isn't, but I can hope, can't I? At least each movie is on a seperate disc. And the collection is at a resonable price."
3,No option to cut off Auto Reverse,"It's a fine piece of equipment and I'd be pleased with it except for one thing. It auto reverses automatically and if you just want to play one side of a tape, you're out of luck. It goes on and on and on and never seems to shut itself off. I like to fall asleep to half an hour of soft music. Having it play over and over all night is not what I had in mind. I would not have purchased it if I'd known this."
5,"""You Know You're an Empty Nester....""","""You Know You're an Empty Nester When..."" is a delightful and amusing read for parents who are facing an empty nest in the not too distant future. It has its poignant moments too. It's also a humorous look back for those who are ""experienced"" empty nesters. I thoroughly enjoyed my journey down memory lane, often laughing out loud at both the sentiments expressed and the cartoons. I recommend this book to all parents who will someday be empty nesters as well as those who are already empty nesters."
1,El Chavo del 8,Es increible que le hagan eso a la gente que ama al chavo del 8. Yo preferiria pagar $20 dolares por unos 5 episodios completos y no $10 por 5 malechos y cortados y se pierde hasta la secuencia. Yo los viera en la television pero no se ni en que canal salen este show. Ojala como dicen varios de uds. que pronto los saquen por temporadas y yo pagaria por eso pero que estubieran bien hechos.
5,The Way of the River - Enlightening!,"""The Way of the River"" is a compelling, beautifully written book that goes far beyond the subject of enlightenment through the study of martial arts. Ms. Loren has the uncanny ability to draw the reader completely into her autobiographical anecdotes, to the point that I absolutely shared her hopes, fears, triumphs and losses keenly. It is a page turner, and I learned a great deal from reading it.Martial artists and students will benefit from her insightful perspective on life and perhaps confirm or renew the spirital and philisophical core of their chosen disciplines. Non-martial artists will be equally captured by her flawless prose, lovingly-crafted descriptions, and beatifully-paced chapters. Ms. Loren has a bright future as a writer, and she will definitely join Mark Salzman's company as an author who secures mainstream popularity outside the martial arts genre."
1,Warps on the first occasion,"I paid more than I thought it would be required to obtain a baking pan that could withstand bread baking temperatures (450 degrees F) without warping (as advertised: ""Thick Rolled Edges Prevent Warping""). However, it warped the first time I used it, and the temperature was only 350 for this particular bread. I would not recommend these pans for any use, I don't care if they stick or not."
2,cuisinart no help with defects,i purchased two of these cookie sheets and they twist and bang in the oven at 325-350. cuisinart will do nothing to help unless i package them and ship them to cuisinart at my own expense PLUS enclose a $14.00 check for them to examine THEIR defective product. they are made in china and cuisinart said any bakeware from them needs to be sent back and tested by them prior to them even considering a replacement. i missed the window of opportunity to return them to amazon as cuisinart requested that i try them a bit longer. very sad to see people not standing behind their product unless the consumer burdens the responsibilty to pay for them to examine the item in their lab in the usa and review their own workmanship that they sell that is made in china! i won't buy cookware from cusinart again!
2,Bleh.,"These worked great ... until they didn't. The large size was perfect, they were decently non-stick and they didn't warp. But, the coating did flake! I had it less than a year, never using it over 425 as specified and the coating flaked off! I threw them out once that started fearing that it would not be healthy. Shame too, I was really happy with them until that."
2,Darn!,"Not impressed. Had high hopes. I Have cooked on it maybe 20 times and the non-stick coating is flaking off. I never put it in the dishwasher and only used a non stick spatula. It's almost like the coating is thinner in some places than in others. Also, as other reviewers have written, it does indeed warp when heated. I will try another brand for my bake-ware. I really thought this would be great, it was so pretty and heavy and seemed really well made all at decent price. Still looking for the perfect cookie sheet."
2,non stick coating peels off easily,"Perhaps these were'nt made for electric ovens. I bought two of these because I had grown to trust the Cuisinart name (and I still do for the most part) but I cooked some chicken in the oven and when I went to wash it, I noticed some strange gray silver flecks and the finish appeared to have bubbled in places. I worried if I had eaten any of that non stick finish so I decided that I would go back to what I had been doing and that was to always line my trays with aluminum foil.I had wanted to get away from using foil all the time. Now I simply dont use these trays very often.If you have a gas oven then you'll probably be fine but I can't recommend this product.I give it two stars becasue they are heavy and good quality aside from the finish.(but thats a very important part)"
1,This is CRAZY!,"Got the 17"" pan for Christmas. First time using it, I was baking fish. When I pulled the pan out of the oven it was CRAZY warped! I've never seen a pan do this. By the time we finished dinner, the pan had flattened back to it's original shape. I'm just glad I wasn't baking a cake in it...I would have been soooooo mad if the warping had created a huge mess in my oven AND ruined a cake!!!! What on earth would cause this warping??May not be keeping this one around. Sorry, Cuisinart:("
5,"Sturdy, well made, easy to clean....","We built a new house and I decided NOT to move my rusty old bakeware into the brand new shiny kitchen...I bought this pan (among other things) and am very pleased with it. It is very strong, sturdy, and easy to clean."
5,quality baking sheet,"heavy gauge steel with a quality non-stick surface, what can I say? It's a baking sheet, not a sports car."
4,Good but a little mis-sized,"I bought this two years ago. I probably use it once a month for baking. Even though it's non-stick, I had purchased a silicone baking mat since it allows the pan to last longer and cookies don't burn. Unfortunately, I discovered that this sheet is about a half inch too narrow (probably 11"" when I needed 11 5/8""). It would have been nice if the full dimensions had been listed on the product desciption.Otherwise, it's done pretty well. Nothing sticks and it cleans up well except for some condensation that seems to have left brown stains that I cannot wash away."
3,Disappointed,"I bought two of these pans more than a year ago and I have had them stain, warp and alter the cooking time for cookies and biscuits. The strange thing is that the very first time I used these pans I was making chocolate chip cookies and one pain stained from the cookies and has never been the same and the other pan didn't. (These pans are not created equal?) Over time, I have also noticed some strange staining in the corners (as the other reviewer noted) and I can't remove it. The warping started several months ago when I had bread in the oven on one of them and I heard that loud bang that we all have heard before. Thank goodness it wasn't a pie. These pans are pretty heavy and maybe it would have thrown the pie off of the sheet! :)"
1,Terrible warping problem,"I have also had a terrible time with this baking sheet warping. It warps anytime it's in an oven over 350 degrees. I can hear it go (and then look inside to see how badly my baking has been damaged). Out of the oven, it returns to its nice flat shape.I know, I know. Stop complaining and replace it. And I will, but I keep this baking sheet around for other non-oven uses, so I forget to replace it.I would NOT buy this baking sheet again. It's not worth the money. Feels heavy and reliable, but that's just more heft to fling your food around in the oven."
5,I want more,"This book was unbelievable, exciting, and a great read. It kept me on the edge of my seat and I couldnt put it down until the last page. Then I sat back with such a satisfied feelings. This book was really good and I think they should make a movie of it. I konw I would buy it!!!! I seen on her web site (www.authorspage.us) she has two more coming out, I cant wait!!!!!Denise"
1,Mac users should avoid this,"Looks like Canon has enough money, or hasn't read sales statistics over the last few years. They do not provide drivers for the scanner portion of this unit for Macs, nor will it work, they claim, over a network. This is a decision made at corporate headquarters in Japan, and the locals at Canon USA are apologetic but powerless.What kind of clueless corporate fool of this size isn't willing to invest a few grand in a competent Mac programmer to write the necessary drivers? After all, they have done it for their inkjets, which have a better reputation than Epson in the Mac community. How hard can it be to port them over to their laser/network models?If you have any Macs in your network and need a printer, you're better off looking elsewhere."
2,Disappointed with the cost of printing,"My office has used this printer for four months now. It isn't very user friendly----it seems to require extra time to get things done, but the printing, faxing, and copying are good.My big complaint is the cost of toner replacement. I'm used to paying about $5/month for toner usage. Since we bought the Canon four months ago, we've been through the starter toner and two new toners ($140 each). I figure I'm paying $90/month for 1,000 copies (or less). I'm looking for a buyer for my Canon."
3,Classy!,"The case is nice but a bit hard! The leather is stiff and hoping in time, it will break in. Its very classy and elegant!"
4,Cute camera wallet,I like this camera wallet and it fits my exilim (Exilim Z750) perfectly. The snap is magnetic and holds well. The wallet is well-built and sturdy. This wallet only hold the camera and nothing else.I am happy with this purchase and would recommend the wallet to anyone else.
4,does not fit Exilim Z1050,"certainly a fine case for other casios, but we had to return it, because it does not fit the Exilim Z1050"
3,for the older exilims,"it is advertised to fit a lot of the new exilims. however, this case is meant for the older ones that are smaller, but you can barely manage to fit the newer exilims in here."
4,Nice,Very nice item. I bought others in the same price range and they do not come near the quality of this recorder. Very clear. Perfect price for the options and the quality. The site says there is no headphone jack but this model DOES have the headphone jack on it.
2,average,"This recorder uses regular cassettes, not mini cassettes. I bought it so I could tape solos and learn them on the sax but the built-in microphone doesn't record music too well. It's probably better-suited for taping lectures, meetings, voice, etc."
4,It is very good tape recorder for its price,"It is a good full size tape recorder, has many features but also missing some. The sound is average and the microphone can be more sensitive. Some features are not very useful like playing the tape in slow speed. What would have been a better feature is to play in slightly faster speed option. I also would like it if it is slightly smaller in width. But this tape recorder is dependable and consistent, I like the LED battery indicator also I like the tape counter. The sliding microphone for increased sensitivity is not outstanding. I recommend this tape recorder for this price range."
5,Panasonic Portable Cassette recorder/player,I'm enjoying this product. It has so many great features and will allow me to transfer some of my best cassettes tapes to my PC - burning them to a CD.Priced right too !!!
3,"Okay for scratches, but...","It'll keep the screen from getting scratched and lets you cradle sync without removing from PDA, but not much more protection. I banged the side of of my 5450 on a chair while it was in the sleeve and the screen got cracked. Now I keep it in the sleeve and a padded case when carrying."
2,Does as much damage as without it,"The design seemed very logical and fresh during initial use. But later I discovered the plastic cover wasn't very smooth inside, and it caused a few major scratches both front and back of my iPAQ. If you hate having scratches on your PDA, avoid this product!!! Get a E&B leather case instead."
5,Karate Breaking Techniques : With Practical Applications to,This book is the most in-depth book on Karate Breaking Techiniques I have ever found. I have never before found such extensive information on this subject compiled in one place before. If you are looking to master breaking techniques I would definetly recommend this book. This book gives extensive tips and secrets that has helped me go from an average competitor to constantly placing in the top 3 in breaking competitions.
2,Scenic DVD,"The CD was great for the scenery, but gave no information on what you were looking at. It would have been more helpful if it had been narrated by someone telling you where you were, & some info about the area."
2,piece of crap for the money.,"i bought a red and blue one and the flash worked twice on the blue before it stopped and it won't even flash on my red one. the photos turned out granular and horrible. only about 3 turned out completely. i don't think that it's worth the money, you're much better off buying a regular disposable and putting a piece of blue plastic in front of the flash."
2,Try again.,This hour long film spends more times at a paint ball park than it does in Chicago. Do you think this is an accurate representation of Illinois? It totally forgot the side of Illinois that borders the Mississippi. Try again.
3,Interesting but nothing new,"June's poetry isn't bad. It's actually quite good... if you have the time to actually read the whole poems. There are some good short ones and I admire the fact she's very honest in her poems but her poetry gets LONG. She has many poems dedicated to ""b.b.L."" and those poems are about relationships which I enjoyed very much because you can relate to what she's feeling. She has one poem entitled: ""Poem After Receiving Voicemail from You After (I Don't Even Know Anymore) How Long!"" Who can't relate to that?"
3,Lancelot Andrews,"This bible is a King James, though it's an Oxford edition, not Cambridge. There are no maps or references. It is good for keeping something compact by your side. If you need glasses, carry 'em. I don't think you'll find much better in this size, but I'll keep looking. So, for a no frills on the go pocket bible that will probably last if you don't use it daily, this is pretty good. 3 + 3/4 stars."
3,Hopeful but Disappointed,"A mediocre, plain-text Bible at best, the most outstanding feature being the fairly good calfskin leather cover. I purchased one which had the words ""Printed in the USA"" by the ISBN/ASIN barcode. After bringing it home and unwrapping it, the Bible inside was actually ""Printed in the Republic of Korea""! The publisher's emailed explanation: the words ""Printed in the U.S.A"" indicates that the external box is printed in the USA - not the Bible! Absurdity and obfuscation at its best, fraudulent marketing practices at its worst - from a ""Christian"" publishing company."
1,a big dissapiontment,"i bought this game thinking it was a decent buy, well i was wrong it turns out that it was a big wate of money. the gameplay is slow and the graphics are the equivelent to dreamcasts.if u want a good football game get madden 2001"
2,Save your hard earned money.......,"Don't bother with this one. This game is no way near as polished as Madden 2001. I think the only people who will enjoy this game are those who are die-hard fans of the Game Day series. The gameplay, presentation, and style is actually very similar to the previous generation Game Days, but the game just goes downhill in terms of presentation and graphics. For the first time, there simply is no comparison between Madden and GameDay. Madden 2001. Hands down."
2,NFL Gameday 2001 vs. Madden 2001,"NFL Gameday 2001- Bad graphics (Playstation 1 graphics on the Playstation2 system) o.k. gameplayMadden 2001 The best graphics yet for anything (even computer) Has to be the best gameplay of any football game yet.I saw a review of NFL Gameday 2001 in a Playstation magazine....and it showed a picture of a quarterback throwing the football... The football, as it left the quarterbacks hands traveled right....his hand was throwing to the left. WHATS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?! I don't like putting games down, but buy Madden 2001 first, then rent Gameday 2001 after....compare, then write a review for both. :-)"
1,Football?!? This ain't no football game!,"NFL Lameday (you heard me!) 2001 is the worst game you can possibly buy. 989 Studios should give everyone there ""money"" back. I don't think I would get this for free. Madden has better graphics, better controls, and it is alot funner. The load times are like the gunshot to the head. The only good quality of this ... is the player's talk. Sony needs better standards. If you want a football game, get Madden or go without."
4,Pretty Good Game,"This game is for the loyal gameday gamers. its basicly like all the other gamedays except much better graphics and gameplay. its create a player is awsome and the tackles are amazing. 989 sports does it again! buy this game, its definitly worth it!"
5,Heh,"a must have for all gameday fans,but for the other people,don't look for any thing real,anyway what video game ain't real,some people brains are starting to work,its a video game.i like how all the coaches look the same which is a bad thing. the Graphics are the only that looks good,the controls are the same as the others.the game rocks"
1,why?,why was this game ever made??? and who allowed it to be made...do yourself a real favor and go pick up nfl2k1 for dreamcast...hell...pick up john elway's qb for nes if you want a better game
2,Don't Waste Your Money...Buy Madden Instead,"Don't even waste your money on this one. I bought this title today thinking that the capabilities would at least equal Madden. Boy, I was wrong. The graphics are sub-par with Madden 2001, and the game play is much, much slower. Honestly, I wish I could get my money back."
1,Don't waste your money!,I can't believe that SONY would spend so much money developing the PS2 and spend very little time or effort developing Gameday. The graphics are jerky and slow. Stick with EA Sports Madden Football
1,What a Joke,"This game is terrible. The animations, the presentation, and the AI are all lousy. Defensive Backs skate backwards and stand totally still in zones. They don't react to anything the offense is doing. The animations pale in comparison to Madden. Sony should have never released this game, it is awful. Sony's football games have been going downhill the last couple years, and this is rock bottom. ...."
1,No quality control,I'm a HUGE fan of the past gamedays and on the first defensive play of the game I hit them for a 2 yard loss and it said my players name from the other team(ie Jevon Kerse from Pittsburg). This title was rushed to market WAY to soon and should be avoided. Hopefully they'll get it right next year.
2,Madden 2001 Is A Lot Better,"I got this game for christmas thinking that it would be better then it was for playstation, boy was I wrong. The graphics are no where as good and the gameplay is even worse. After playing Madden 2001 you will not want to play this game ever again. The players are misportioned and move slow moving and as someone else said it is very hard to run the ball. This game is not as lifelike as I thought it would be. So if you are thinking about buying this game save your money and go buy Madden 2001. GameDay is the worst game put out for ps2 todate."
3,Not enough of an improvement.,"For PS2, I would have expected the graphics to be better. They do not look as good as Madden's, dragging down the score. The gameplay is still here, and is still quite a bit of fun. The rock music and drum beats help move things along, but it has a few flaws that drag it down."
1,Get the Madden,"This game in one word ...! Get the Madden 2001 and don't even bother with this game. I got it and played it once and had to take it out. Terrible graphics and shotty game play. Bottom line, don't even buy it!"
2,Not worth the 50 bucks,Well I won't be as harsh as everyone else but this game is not worth forking over 50 bucks. I wouldn't even spend the money to rent this game. The game play totally stinks. I regret paying for this game but it was an impulse buy. The only way this game might be worth it is if you borrow it from some poor sap that regretfully bought it (like me). It has some good points like some of the tackles are actually pretty cool. But other than that not too many pros here.
4,It's Not that Bad,"I bought the game because my friend suggested it to me. I think it is a good game because it gives you easier gameplay. Madden may have better graphics, but Gameday has easier passing and easier rushing. Besides, the hard hits make the game look cool. So, if you happen to find this game available at the local rental shop, give it a try. You may think Madden is better (which it probably is), but this game isn't bad."
2,Good...But Will Never Match Up To Madden,"The graphics are great (perhaps better than Madden) and the general game mode is good. But I'm a football game enthusiast, and I pay great attention to the tedious details that the game manufacturers have overlooked. When you throw to a receiver, the receiver stands in one stop and catches the ball. Unless you use the ""total control"" option (which allows you to throw ahead of the receiver)...and I have yet to complete a pass using the complicated, useless option. But what I really don't like is the sorry excuse for ""General Manager Mode"". You can only play 10 years with the same team...never get fired, or change teams (availible on Madden) and there is no free agent signing, or trading period (also availible on Madden). It's very easy to tell that the folks at 989 Sports are desperately trying to match up againt EA Sports...but with no success. If you want the complete feel of the game.... this isn't where it's at."
1,Waste of money time and energy turning on the playstation,"Worst game I've ever played in my life by far, I wish I owned a Video Game company so I could make a good game for playstation2 and make a million bucks. They really need to get it together if they want to even do better than Dreamcast."
4,good game for the ps2,This game is ok madden is better but this is all right. For the first game on the ps2 for the gameday series it is a good game and a good game to make better wich they did
1,Not even for free!,I rented this game for free with a coupon from Movie Gallery. I am SO glad I didnt have to pay for this! I returned my free 5 night rental early. I am glad I didnt waste any money on this poor game.
2,A Big Dissapointment,This game I thought would be better than Madden. Most Madden games in the past I thought were slow in the run game as well as not that much of an offensive game. This game is a joke. The offense is not good in the run game since it seems like the players are going in slow motion. The offense is good because it is almost impossible to stop someone on defense. My friends and I played all with the same reaction. If you like have games that end 65-63 with the person winning getting lucky with the one interception in the game then buy this but if you want a good football game buy Madden. I just hope college gamebreaker will improve since it is being released later.
1,Madden VS Gameday,"Save your money and buy Madden instead. Madden graphics on the old playstation are even better than this new Gameday.Madden 2001 is the BEST football game ever, Ive played almost all of them. 2k1 on dreamcast dosnt even come close."
2,Disappointing,"I've always had very good experiences with Panasonic equipment but I found this walkman (*ahem*, sorry... portable cassette player) to be barely worth the price. Unfortunately the number of options in portable cassette players has been reducing dramatically in response to the success of MP3 players and portable cds. If like me, you still need a cassette player you're going to want something better than this unit.The real problem is the ergonomics. The switch to reverse direction is easily tripped, as are the FF and RW buttons. Because the tape goes into the unit in an anti-intuitive way and because there is no tape direction indicator it's easy to fast forward when you meant to rewind (and vice versa.) Also the belt clip pops off so easily I've given up on using it. I just put the unit (which is nice and small) in a jacket pocket.The unit is cheaply made and the hardware feels flimsy. You are barely getting what you paid for it."
4,very happy with Deni convection oven,"we've used convection ovens foryears and have gone through several, from plastic bowls to glass. we are very happy with this oven, which is glass, because it is easy to clean, works well, and the temperature goes up to 450, which other ovens do not. we would purchase another one."
2,Not a Jetstream Oven,I was looking for a replacement for my Jet Stream Oven. The Jet Stream procuces wonderful results but I am having to replace the lid and pan every year or so. I wanted something that held up longer so I tried this product. I takes longer to cook and does not produce the same results. The food gets brown on the top but not on the bottom. Also crispy type foods are not as cripsy as the jet stream. The oven gets very hot on the outside. The main problem I think is the Jet Stream moves the air at very high velocity and the Deni is know where near as fast. I will go back to buying replacement parts for jet stream to get the quility.
4,I had one of these before,"I had one of the Deni Convection Ovens before, and it lasted over 12 years until I dropped the lid on the floor.It doesn't seem to get at as hot as the other one I had, but it still works fine."
5,awesome,"I love this oven. Its great to use in place of my standard regular oven. It saves energy, cooks faster than regular oven, and it doesn't heat up my kitchen when in use. It has so many uses. If you get the accessories to go with it, like the different pan inserts, this can be used for even more. I cant say enough good things about it and its great if you are on the go or have kids."
4,Convection Cooking,I have had my Deni for at least 8 years and enjoyed using it. I have misplaced the extender ring and cannot get a replacement part. That is my only complaint about the product. I cooked a three pound turkey breast and one sweet potato in 45 minutes yesterday and I was very pleased with how they came out. The turkey was juicy and the large potato perfecly cooked. It is a nice not to have to turn on a large oven for a meal for one person. Ideal for single persons.
1,Seller Should be banned,Seller never sent item. Took almost a month and a half to get the amazon a-z guarantee. Sent hundreds of emails asking for a refund.
4,Good Cooking,"It is certainly what I had hoped for when I paid for the item, it does the job and the food is of great quality!"
1,NOPE!!!,"Please don't buy this oven. My fiance and I bought ours at Walmart and after about 2 months the Power and the Heat buttons on top started going off/on. Sometimes we have to jiggle the cord before they'll both come on. And sometimes both buttons will turn themselves off in the middle of cooking something. We go back half an our later and the food isn't done yet, and we have to jiggle the cord and restart the timer from 10 or 15 minutes back. Happened to me just now so I decided to write this review and warn you guys about this awful oven. Please don't waste yalls money on this thing."
4,Really deep dish.,I really like this pan for its depth and weight....the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the lip of the pan could be a little larger to make fluting the edges easier.
4,Terrific for deep dish pies,"I was looking high and low for a deep dish pie pan This is wonderful.Makes a nice crust and is easy to clean. Only caveat is you need nylon utensils or you'll ruin the nonstick surface.Rim is a little narrow for making fluted pie crusts, otherwise this is a perfect pie pan."
5,Deep dish pie pan,"These are great heavy duty pans. They are very heavy. Was surprised that they were so deep,like to pies in one crust. Great for people who do not like all that crust. Bought for great granddaughter who loves baked pumpkin,but will not eat the crust. Also got on buy 3 and 4th is free. Cuisinart is the best."
5,Nice!,"I really liked how the item came - it was wrapped with more than enough wrappings. Although the description already said it was new, I was amazed by the shininess of the pan, and I'm always pleased when I order something that comes with the original tags on it. I will be using very often it in the near future!"
2,THE SMALL SIZE IS NOT GOOD FOR 4-6 YEARS OLD.,I did ordered one Size small for my 5 years old daughter and it was too small. So when I tried to order a Medium size they didn't have any more. So please be aware SMALL size is for 2-4 Years old kids but not for 5 and 6.
3,Parent,"My son loves this costume, but it runs a little smaller then expected... I should have gotten the larger size because my son is very thin but also tall 42""... It fits, but is tight. I ordered the Child Small and should have ordered the Child Medium. I should of ordered UP.... But he still loves it."
5,Great Find,"My 3 1/2 yr old wanted to be Scooby this year, and after finding the same costume for $45 everywhere else I decided to try out ordering it through amazon, I ordered early just in case there were any problems so I'd have time to return it, but I'm happy to say we are very pleased. My son normally wears a 3T, I ordered a child's small in this costume, he has some growing room but I'm happy with how it fits him, and it seems to be good quality, not so thick he'll be hot, and roomy enough that if it's too cold out he'll be able to wear clothes under it, and it looks just like the picture. I won't be so hesitant to order something like this from amazon in the future, and I've now got a very excited kiddo who can't wait for Halloween!"
5,Size runs very small. But good product.,"my son wears this every other day. Definately got my moneys worth. Size runs very small my three year old who is average size just barely fit this, good thing I read the reviews."
4,"Very cute costume, everyone loved it!","This is such a cute costume. I ordered a small for my (average size) almost 3 year old and it was a little big, but a size smaller would have been too small on him. It was worth the $$ for the quality of the costume. We got so many positive comments on this Scooby Doo costume, everyone loved it!"
1,Complete waste of money,"This costume was a HUGE disappointment. I ordered this exact costume 2 yrs ago for my youngest son. This year I ordered it for my oldest. The description said it should fit 5-7 yr olds (size 8-10). My son is 7 yrs old & only 50 lbs. He's 46"" & skinny as a rail. This costume was 6"" too short. I had to purchase fabric to extend the length so he did not look ridiculous. The fabric used in the costume is so extremely cheap (unlike the previous one I purchased by Rubies Scooby for 1 yr olds) and the Scooby head looked absurd, I had to open a seam & stuff it more to make it look better. The stitching looked as if it had been done by a child. I scoured the internet to find a reasonably priced Scooby costume... Including Ebay. Unfortunately, this one ($35.00) was the cheapest I could find. I cannot fully express how disappointed I am in Rubies & Amazon for selling this costume for such an inflated price."
1,WAY TOO SMALL!!!!,"My son is 4, we ordered a child's small; which is supposed to be size 4-6. The feet hit him mid shin! We sent it back and ordered the medium(8-10). It is just verily big enough. So SIZE UP if you get this. I was also disappointed in the construction. The head is small and squashed, there were strings hanging, and the color is much lighter then what showed in the picture. My son wanted to be Scooby SO BAD and I bought the more expensive of the scooby outfits thinking it would be better quality...it's not! I would have sent it back if my son hadn't wanted to dress up as scooby so bad."
4,"great costume, confusing sizing","My 4 year old loves the scooby costume. However, the sizing is way off. After reading reviews that said the sizing is small, I ordered child medium/ size 8-10. My son wears size 5 clothing, and there's lots of room in size 5 for him... The size 8-10 costume is about 4 inches too short for him. Luckily the bottom of the costume is not like a footed sleeper... it has foot holes with velcro stirrups. So it's okay that it's a little short. But I think he could have worn a size large just fine. We will definitely be able to see his shoes when he's wearing the costume, and the feet will not cover them. Luckily my son doesn't mind or even notice this. : definitely order a size (or two) up. Otherwise, this is a nice, cute costume."
1,Rubies Scooby Doo Deluxe Costume awful,"Though the costume seems great and should hold up, the sizing and measurements are WAY OFF. What a dissappointment that BOTH times I bought this costume neither of the sizes/measurements were correct. My son is growing into a size 8, when I got the medium suppose to be a size 8) we had him try it on and he couldn't even get it on. The paws were almost to the knees! Then I ordered the Large (suppose to be up to a size 12). Yeah right! This should have been for a size 6/7 with the Medium being a size 5. The Large size had the paws at mid calf and the jumper portion, with the hood up, was pulling significantly in the crotch area.Since I had no to time to send the Large back and look, I guess for an adult size, I had to have a friend basically deconstruct this and add fabric to make it fit. She has been sewing for years and agreed that the measurements were WAY OFF.BEWARE should order at least two sizes larger than what your child wears!"
1,scooby costume let down,Not pleased ....ordered a size bigger than what my child normally wears and it was still too small ... And for it being deluxe seemed like I could have bought it at a dollar store ...would have returned but it was too close to Halloween... Dislike
5,youth scooby doo costume,My daughter was the star of the halloween party. All her friends want to be Scooby next year. So much fun!
2,Scooby costume,"I bought this for my 4 year old son in size Medium. My son is about 44 inches tall and it was running short on him, especially in the body:( It was too late to exchange it before Halloween so he wore it anyway and had fun but would have been much more comfortable in one size bigger outfit."
1,Nothing like Scooby Doo,"This costume looks terrible. Gone are the days of plushy, well made costumes it seems. This costume is thin (I actually wasn't sure if they had sent the wrong one at first!), it runs small, and it looks *nothing* like Scooby Doo. I even tried going to a couple of halloween stores to look at the costumes in person, hoping my defective item was just a one-off. Sadly, they are ALL poorly made. Ours looks like a rat that's been run over. Or maybe Crash Bandicoot. But certainly not Scooby, and not even remotely close to the picture on this site or the packaging itself..Update to original review:Buy Costumes did agree to pay for return shipping and gave me a full refund on the item."
2,Warning - runs small!,"My 5 yr old grandson had outgrown his favorite costume, a Scooby Doo from last year, size Small kids.So I ordered a new one in Medium (they said 8-10). When it arrived the package said Medium 5-7. And it is TOO small, he's not an unusually large 5 yr old, wears size 5-6 usually.This isn't much bigger than the Small from last year and he is so disappointed. He's very unhappy that I have to return it, but even worse, the quality has gone down hill. Lighter weight fabric, he even noticed that the SD ""tag"" is flimsy compared with his old one. Price is a little higher than last year, too.And NO ONE has a Large kids anywhere on line - I've spent the last 30 minutes searching and searching. I have a sad 5 yr old Scooby-lover on my hands!So, I'm going to return it with no replacement coming.SusanD in NoCalif"
3,Tiny!,"Holy cow were the other reviewers not kidding about this running small! (Thankfully I ordered a Medium and a Large, just in case.) My son is 4, 42"", 41-42 pounds. Generally wears a 5 and the medium is TIGHT and the legs are basically too short. I know you're thinking you should just order a medium because there's no way they run *that* small, but I'm here to tell you they do!"
3,"Very cute costume, but it runs small","The costume is very cute and well made. However, it seems to run small. My son comfortably fits 4T clothing, and this is snug in the crotch and pulls tight around the face. Be aware that this seller also has a strict return policy on costumes that I was not aware of. Sales after September 30th are final on costumes. In a way, I can't blame them because I am sure that there are parents out there who return used costumes. But most sites will allow returns as long as the package is postmarked before Halloween. I am disappointed because now I have no choice but to allow my kid to be uncomfortable all day long on Halloween."
5,Great Buy!,What a great buy! It was about $15 cheaper with this company than others I looked at . The costume is made very well. It will serve both as a costume and for dress-up afterwards.Don't hesitate to purchase!
1,Not that happy,"Sad that this product failed us twice. We were sent the costume with a broken zipper. Then I had to pay over $10 to ship it back to the seller...and, on a positive note, they sent a replacement back right away...but, on a negative note, with a broken zipper again. I decided to live with it and ""baby it"" because my daughter absolutely loves Scooby Doo. I guess if the zipper gets too bad, I will rip the defective one out and sew a new one in. Didn't want to pay another $10 to send it back again."
2,Cute but disappointing for the price,"My granddaughter put it on to go to a carival the night before halloween and the zipper started splitting on that first wear. We didn't have time to put a new zipper in on Halloween so we worked around it. I understand that zippers aren't always the most sturdy things, but for us to pay $50 for a costume and not have it stay together for one night is pretty sad. We also found the head was heavy and always falling in her eyes so we pinned it back. We were disappointed by it for the money we spent."
2,What a disappointment,"Well I purchased this item in a medium size two days before my 8 year old son was to wear it to school for their Halloween class party. Last minute he changed his mind from Buzz to Scooby! Kids :) So I went online and he loved this one. Shipped it for next day delivery and when it arrived I had him try it on..... The package stated it was a medium, however, the measurements were all wrong! I checked online and measured it myself and wouldn't you believe that the measurements were exact for a size small! So here I have a size small Scooby costume with size medium tags on it! Aside from the wrong measurements, the costume is nice and cute.... He went as Buzz after all and had a great time, but I will not purchase a costume online again."
2,disappointed-runs small,"I was disappointed because I bought a small for my son's 4 year old birthday and it was too small. I debated about what size to buy and the product detail indicated that it fits a child up to 48 inches and my son is about 44 inches. I thought 4 inches was an appropriate leeway but it was too short and the paws didn't cover my son's feet. I coudn't send it back because he would have been very disappointed sending his birthday present back. He loves dressing up and Scooby Doo. He actually slept in the costume because he was so enthralled. If you choose to buy, GO UP A SIZE!"
2,Defective,"The costume arrived with the stitching on the wrong side of one of the paws (hands) such that my daughter had to twist it around in order to keep her hand through the sleeve. Also, the zipper is very fickle. Sometimes it wants to work, sometimes it doesn't. Ultimately my daughter still loved dressing up as Scooby Doo and the costume looks great, but the workmanship is supsect."
3,Scooby doo costume,"This is a great scooby doo costume. However, the size is completely off. Runs about one size too small. My child wears a size 6 and the costume was way too small."
4,Cute Halloween Costume,My son wore this for Halloween this year and everyone love it he got lots of compliments on it. It definetley is cute. As for quality well that was certainly not too good but as for a one use costume not too bad. The zipper was a little hard to work and he fell down once and had a big hole in the knee but it did the job it was entended for so no complaints from me.
5,LOVED BY ALL!!!,Everyone Loved the Costume. Great Quality! Would recommend to Everyone :) Very Pleased! Team him with another character for a great hit!
1,disappointed,"I was disappointed by the Scooby head, it looked more like a regular brown dog. The pants tore after 2 hours of wearing and I was told it would not qualify for a refund. Waste of money!!"
3,Size was a problem! Everything else was great!,This costume was supposed to fit a 5-7 yr old child.....my child is 5 and it was actually REALLY small on him.....way to short!!!!!!! There is no was it would fit a 7 yr old child!!!!! Everything else with the costume was great! Quality was fine and my son loved it! I just didn't have the heart to tell him it looked funny on him because it was so small.
5,Great fit,"I have a four year old son who absolutely wanted to be Scooby Doo for Halloween, and it was a perfect fit for him, the size was great and he had a blast in the costume for Halloween."
5,Quality Produce,This recorder was exactly what the description said it was. I am happy with this recorder and use it for the classes I am taking in college. Thanks!
1,Dissapointed,"When I opened the box I was very impressed. It looked neat and operable. This feeling soon changed when I loaded a 15/16 tape. It played slow and the max volume control position did not provide enough volume, had to hold it up by my ear. I then put in a normal speed tape and found the same thing. The tape played slow distorting the music. I would not recommend this unit for anything. It may be good for record and playback. That way the slow speed may be compinsated for. But then you could not play the tape with quality on another tape deck."
5,"Great little portable cassette players L51, L31, L11",Great little shirtpocket recorders/players. Great sound andquality. Interesting 3 LED battery indicator.
5,Awesome S#!+,"I honesty was not even aware this album existed until a couple days ago. The first time I heard Reggie Watts was on Conan. I was immediately very impressed at his creativity and skill. I loved 'Why S#!+ So Crazy,' and I couldn't help but imagine how he might sound if he did something that wasn't comedy or improvised. I did a search and turned up this album. It did not disappoint. If you like his other work, and you like music with soul, chances are you will like this. Check it out."
2,Not so great,Now I know why it was soo cheap it is some of Reggies old stuff his new stuff is way better
1,not so good,"The lyrics are trite. The music has some moments, but is generally sterile even by electronic standards. This album seems like it was hacked out in a weekend. I'd stick with Reggie's Maktub albums ... much, much better."
2,okay,I thought this would work great for me. It's roomy and soft. I also have the same problem of my iPac comming on while in this case and then I have no power when I want to use it and any new information is lost.
1,Battery warning!,"I don'tknow if it is a quirk of my PocketPC or of the case, but my unit apparently turns itself on spontaneously. Maybe something in the case presses the power button, or maybe my unit is crazy, but I just lost EVERYTHING that was in my PocketPC because some engineer decided they didn't actually want to engineer a product."
5,The Humanistic Tradition-,Great books.. excellent picture quality and the book was in great condition. I would recommend to anyone thats interested in the arts and history. I had these books assigned for my class and I'm glad he chose these rather than anything else.
3,"Was hoping for strategy, not step by step instructions","The guides are really detailed, but essentially tell you each and every step to take. There is no overall strategy to guide you. You either figure the puzzle out on your own, or read the step by step guide. You can't avoid the spoilers,so don't try. It's a really in depth book, but I find that the action in the game goes so fast that you can't possibly notice all the little side stops. And it often gives some bad advice. Early in Half Life 2 the author says ""It's never a good idea to drive through fire."" Ok. so later in the game, you come to a canal that has what looks like several possible solutions, but it is blocked off at one end by fire. After messing around for half and hour, I checked the guide, and the solution is....just drive through the fire."
1,WHY was this made NOW?,"i have no clue why they made a strategy guide without the actual GAME!!!!!! Come ON people you would actually buy a strategy guide without a game? you probably just want to look at the final boss obviously, not the MAPS, please, spare me the excuses."
5,Ranma's back for the 19th time!,"La! It was quite hard waiting for this book to come out, but now it is and all is well and good. ...Except the ending is a real cliffhanger and now I desparately need #20...what happened in this manga, you ask? Ranma's pa begins to feel inferior to his son, which leads to a heated battle. Then Akane makes Cherry Blossom Mochi that will tell her who her true love is. Last but not least, a martial arts cheerleader falls madly in love with KUNO, of all people.But my words don't do this story justice, so you'll just have to read it for yourself. You won't be disappointed (unless you're an anti-ranma or anti-rumiko type).happy reading! ^_^"
5,Continuously Fun!,"Many serial novels, especially comic books, eventually becomeboring and predictable. A great exception is the Ranma 1/2manga. This series is continually unexpected and fresh."
4,Lee Perry,"Everyone's entitled to their opinion. I simply don't agree with the review below mine. Granted, Lee Perry isn't for everyone. Nor is Dub. However, IF you are a dub fan and Lee Perry fan, I highly recommend this cd. It's not a head-phone-listen-closely marvel. It's simply a live trancey dub production from Lee and Mad Professor. To pull off dub live is close to impossible and they do it with skill and love. It is one of my favorite Lee Perry albums. I hope if you spend your money on it, you enjoy it as much as I do."
5,good mold,"This mold is a nice heavy plastic, not flimsy at all. Made perfect little candies the first time - my only complaint would be that there isn't a mold that would make bigger candies - I bought another leaf mold and the two are not of similar shape. But it is a great product overall and I'm very happy with it."
3,"Delightful, charming, humorous","Romantic Times, August 1995, Reviewer Lizabell Cox""TOUCHED BY MOONLIGHT offers a delightful and sometimes humorous glimpse of East Coast life at the turn of the century. Ms. Howey's thoroughly modern heroine is sure to charm readers."""
3,Oh MAN it's so poppy,"It's truly better than a lot of records out there, but I can't say I'm a fan of this direction at all. If you want something a little moodier and, I'll say it, a tad more indie, get Hope and Adams. It's so much more fulfilling. I feel dumb and snotty writing any of this, but it's all true."
1,"A Huge Disappointment after 1999's brilliant ""Hope and Adams""","I was, and still am, a huge fan of Wheat's 1999 album, ""Hope and Adams"". Comparisons at that time to Wilco, Paul Westerberg, Whiskeytown, etc, were all warranted and, as expected, the album has stood the test of time...Four years later, we get ""Per second, Per second, Per second... Every Second"". My first impression after listening to the album was a sense of bewilderment at the obvious change of musical direction, evident from the outset on ""I Met A Girl"". This shallow faux pop style, prevalent throughout the whole album, devoid of any lyrical value, leads me to conclude one of two things; 1. They have a new songwriter and the good one left the band; or 2. the band as a whole decided that they should 'sell out' and write a pop album that would be appropriate for daytime radio. Either way, this album is 'Annus Horribilus' and should be avoided at all costs. I can only assume that their new album, ""Everyday"" is every bit as bad."
1,Not worth it.,"I bought this CD without knowing anything about the band, never having heard any of Wheat's singles, or even having read a review. The cover looked interesting, and, since I didn't have much money to spend, the $11 price was appealing.In short, their name perfectly describes their music: it is bland, completely unoriginal, and each song sounds like the next. The songs are formulaic, and the lyrics are mundane. Nothing is particularly catchy, or even worth being dubbed a ""guilty pleasure."" It's just a boring, nothing CD. If you want catchy, indie rock, listen to the New Pornographers or even Clap Your Hands Say Yeah. They actually deliver the fun melodies and spunk that Wheat promises, without sounding like everything else on the radio."
2,eh--i give it 2 1/2 stars,"Their older stuff is better--no contest.Maybe it will grow on me, but I sort of doubt it."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this CD, unheard, based on name value alone. When I say ""name value"", I mean the name ""Wheat"". It's no secret that I love Bread, and thought any group that named itself Wheat was paying a silent debt to Mssrs. Gates and company. Well, I was quite wrong.That's not to say that Wheat is a bad group, but I guess it's just not easy overcoming my (pretty lofty) expectations. When you're expecting Bread, and you get a pita (I'm using a metaphor), things just aren't the same."
1,Horrible sound quality,"I really didn't have any problems with interference, however the sound quality is just horrid. There is absolutely no bass what so ever, do not buy this product"
2,Not for Zunes with Harddrives,The interference shielding on this unit sucks. The noise from the harddrive spinning bleeds through and distorts all audio. Works okay with the smaller SSD/Memory stick units.
1,Junk!,"This item is a piece of junk. Not worth spending your money. Even if you find a channel sound quality is POOR and it picks up the the humming of the car (or at least in my case it did). You hit the gas and you can hear it in the speakers (not sure how to explain, almost like if there was feedback). Anyway don't waste your money, I had it for over a year and tried to use maybe 4-5 times it is somewhere in my junk pile of stuff I am going to throw out and not even donate because its not worth putting someone through the same misery I went through with it! I didn't put the star rating either, I gave it NO STARS, Amazon must default to give it some type of rating, well no stars means...PIECE OF JUNK!"
1,Terrible sound quality,"So I purchased this FM Transmitter shortly after purchasing my Zune because I wanted to be able to listen to my MP3 library in the car. A co-worker has the DLO FM Transmitter for another brand MP3 player (not the iPod), and the quality is pretty good. Not so with the Zune. You'll be lucky to get AM quality sound filled with static and internal noise from the Zune itself. You can hear the drive spinning as a song starts...I returned it within a day and purchased the Zune brand car kit, and while it's not perfect either, at least it's almost always FM quality if not better."
1,Should be better for price!,"I got one of these so I could listen to my Zune over the stereo in my Mustang. There was a lot of static and I had to turn the volume all the way up just to hear it. I returned it because I thought mine was defective, but it turns out it just is really bad for the big price. I went to Wallmart and got a MP3 cassette Hookup where I just plug it into the headphone jack and it sounds great playing through the cassette player, Which was only about $15.Griffin Direct Deck Universal Cassette Adapter for MP3 Players"
1,Terrible Product,"I bought one of these without having seen the buyer reviews. Big mistake. I am experiencing the same problems - low output level and a low-frequency pulsing noise. Some have said this is the sound of the disk drive. I have noticed that it goes away for a second when switching screens so I'm wondering if it has to do with the backlight on the Zune? Regardless, this device is useless as an in-car application for the Zune."
3,Not Bad,"This product is effective, but the sound quality is very quiet. I always had to turn my radio all the way up, because turning the sound on the zune up doesn't work. That's really the only draw back I had with it."
1,Not worth it,"I purchased this item because I liked the idea of a single connector to play and charge my Zune at the same time. I was not overly concerned about the quality of the FM frequency transmission, since I am looking to hard-wire to an aux input in my car soon. Needless to say I am disappointed with the audio output on this device using the Zune connector. The only way to get reasonable audio output was to use a 3.5mm cable from the Zune headphone jack to the aux input on the DLO. Using the USB connector, you get tons of electronic interference from the activity of the Zune (button presses, etc) as well as background static. This is going back tomorrow and I will resume the wait for a proper Zune dock for my car."
1,Crap,"This thing worked the first time I plugged it in but doesn't work after that, not even the aux plug."
1,Doesn't work at all,I ordered this product to use it with my Zune device. It doesn't work at all. All I heard was static.
1,dissapointing,"I bought this adaptor for a trip we went on. I read the reviews they werent so hot, most of thelm said the sound quality was poor,I believed it would get the job done, WOW they were so right. I am very unhappy with the sound quality, I didnt think it could be so bad, its terrible. Do not buy this unit unless you want scarry sounds for Haloween."
4,For an FM transmitter it does the job,The best reception your going to find is through the magnetic pickup using one of those psydo cassette cartridges. That said don't except CD quality and you won't be dissappointed. For the price point it's a great buy.
2,I really wanted to like this...,"...But i don't. I bought, put it in, and it worked. fuzzy sometimes, but i'm not that picky. the thing is, it broke. this may not be common, but it just stopped working. the only thing it does now is charge. it doesn't even display anything. the warranty expired and now i'm looking for a better one like the griffin fm transmitter plus."
3,Best you will get for the zune,"I got my zune for christmas 2006, the main reason, for my car. I bought the microsoft transmitter, which is 80 dollars, and was so awful. I then returned that, bought the belkin tune base, which I waited a couple months for to come out, and that was even worse, then I found this, and ordered it since I had this same one when I had an ipod and the sound was as good as it would get for a transmitter. This is defintily the best sound quality ur going to get without professional installation of the zune into your car. Somewhat static, not perfect, but good enough."
4,"If you like westerns, you will like The Big Valley","I did not waste any time ordering The Big Valley when Amazon.com offered it to me at half price via email. I was a fan of this show from watching reruns of it in the 1980's. The Big Valley is a television western with a little element of a soap opera. There were two very young actors on this show. Lee Majors (Heath Barkley) and Linda Evans (Audra Barkley) would go to be major tv stars of the 70's and 80's. The reason I do not give this dvd set 5 stars is because it has no extra's such as special features,interviews, and commentary. You do get your money's worth as far as episodes though as the set has 30. On a final note, I did not experience any problems with Amazon.com as far as purchasing and receiving the product."
1,Six and 1/2 Episodes would not play...,"I wish I could give it a (much) higher rating - for I like The Big Valley episodes a lot. However, 3 episodes on Side A of Disc One, and 3 and 1/2 episodes on Side A of Disc Three would not play - either with scrambled pixels or would not allow DVD player to enter.Granted, the seller allowed return within 7 days from reception. However, just so happened that I had to find time to purchase a new DVD player - with the new player only to find out that the discs were defective. By that time, there had been 2-3 weeks from the date of receiving the product.By the way, the product (issued by Fox Home Entertainment group) is NOT made in China, but in the USA... Certainly not a good publicity - makes one wonder if we (USA) still have what it takes to make good reliable products, while everyone is talking about creating (or regaining) manufacturing jobs in the US! :-("
5,"Yes Virginia, there is a Santa...","Finally, Finally, FINALLY! I grew up on Big Valley re-runs, and hoard them when I see the re-runs. I had seen the vhs versions, but couldn't see myself buying them, and I am so glad I waited. I devoured the 5 disc set, and it is amazing how much you more you can glean by watching them in succession, even as opposed to watching them piecemeal. I literally sat transfixed while watching these episodes, and plan to enjoy them many times again. I must admit, watching them in succession, the drama can seem a bit over the top at times, but the produces really knew how to pack a punch, obvious in light of the huge cult following the show has. I believe this is one of the BEST dramas on tv, and find that even Bonanza doesn't stand thetest. Bonaza seems a bit creepy to me,with 4 men living in the same house and no women--ever. I think BV is a better production, more sophisticated storyline, and overall a better show. THANK YOU!"
3,Big Valley season one,on the first 2 discs the were one episode that you could not view. the ones that could be seen were good thou. So except for the 2 shows it was good.
3,worth a watch,The Big Valley series is basically a western soap opera. It's fun just to sit down and watch these short stories.
4,Yee-haw the Barkleys are here!,"I have always enjoyed ""The Big Valley""...I am not really a fan of westerns, but ""The Big Valley"" was the best. I had a crush on all the Barkley boys, and while growing up, I always wondered what it would be like to live with those hunks! I did notice that when they had family meetings, Audra was never included, because she was so young, and they all were almost alcoholic. They had good hearts, but were always misunderstood. Audra was a tough cookie, and it was a surprise that she ended up ladylike with all of those brothers..None of the episodes are hokey. They all are actually quite entertaining...I can't wait for the next seasons!"
4,Great dvd,I purchased this dvd for my dad and he absolutely loves it. Great quality for such an old series. He can't wait for the rest of them to come out on dvd.
4,Big Valley = Season 1,Back to a real western -- what a treat! Good old days of TV when a season was really 1/2 a year instead of just 13 episodes. Good family viewing. Looking forward to Season 2!
5,Old shows are the best shows,"I've pretty much given up on the television shows of today. There are only a few shows on that don't insult the viewer. Most of what I watch now is classic television shows on DVD. I couldn't be happier with the Season one set of The Big Valley. Action, adventure, drama, comedy, it has all of these in spades. The episode quality is great, and even the""not so good"" episodes are better than what is on television today. I would highly recommend this set. My only regret is that Season two was split into two releases. I wish the studios would stick with a full season set."
2,"DECENT SHOW,WITH TERRIBLE DVD FEATURES","SHOW ITSELF IS NOT TOO BAD,BUT THE FIRST SEASON MENU REALLY AN ANNOYING PAIN,MENU HAS NO ""PLAY ALL"" FEATURE AND EACH EPISODE YOU HAVE TO PUSH PLAY TWICE.ALSO THE SET HAS DOUBLE SIDED DISCS THAT REALY BAD FOR USERS,WHILE TRYING TO CLEAN ONE SIDE YOU SCRATCH UP THE OTHER SIDE.AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST(TO WHOEVER MANUFACTURERS THESE DVDS)USE SINGLS SIDED DISCS WITH AS ""MANY"" EPISODES AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY SQUEEZE ON EACH DISC(AS FEW SINGLE SIDED DISCS AS YOU CAN USE)IN ADDITION TO ADDING A ""PLAY ALL"" FEATURE."
5,"What Happened to Stockton, CA",It was the bomb when the Barkley's owned most of the land. Kind of cool living in the area that it was written about and filmed at.
3,BIG VALLEY,"Big Valley is a great addition to my collection, it wasn't a big favorite of mine; however my western collection would be incomplete without it.Everybody seem to be over acting to me, that made it a bit unrealistic. Having said that,it brought back good memories just the same."
5,Excelente,Excelente negociao.Estou extremamente feliz.Muit√≠ssimo obrigada.Espero poder fazeroutros neg√≥cios futuramente.Total confiana.Big Valley - Season 1Um abrao
3,Little Better than Alarming,"The only thing you can say about this docu-drama is that it is talking about the right thing. It starts with the warning that this only a 'scenario' so you shouldn't confuse this with Orson Welles' radio broadcast of ""War of the Worlds."" Then, they show some people, like Mike Davis, who really know about the issue but then they don't really let them speak specifically about what needs to be done. In the end, the show oddly turns vaguely optimistic that the authorities will do something--which, frankly, seems woefully out of sync with what they had to say in the beginning and, to be honest, reality."
2,Prints quickly but very disappointed with problems,"I will keep it short and simple.I had high hopes for my new MF6530. It turned out to have very good print speeds with very good quality print jobs. I liked a few of the features such as 2 sided printing.Unfortunately, it was not very reliable. It started with many unusual error codes which resulted in continuous resets which involved having to unplug the unit several times for 5 min minimum as well as removing and re-installing drivers. It has not even begun to measure up to the older brother mfc8640 that I also own. It is 2 years older and has printed perfectly each and every time I've ever used it.In summary, great printer, when it works. For me, that is as good as a paperweight. I'll never buy a canon printer again."
2,It would be great if using the multipurpose tray wasn't such a pain,"I have a four-year old Imageclass D680, which I love. Since it isn't being produced any more, I recommended the MF6530 to one of my clients, thinking that it would be even better. It's fast and prints great. However, it turns out that in order to print envelopes in the multipurpose tray (or any other odd-size paper, for that matter), you have to change the paper size setting in the menu every time. The orange error light keeps flashing until you do. It also took a rocket scientist to figure out what the flashing light meant. Getting through the menu is also an ordeal. Then, when you're done, you have to set it back to letter size. For an office that needs to print all kinds of things, this is just not good enough. I'm sorry I recommended it and my client hates it!"
1,Sir JAM A LOT,"I think the machine I tried was an individual Lemon. I tried to make copies of patents in stacks of 5 to 30 sheets in the document feeder at a time. It started out jaming every other sheet. It quickly went to jaming 3 out of 4 tries. I used 4 different papers of different thicknesses without any solution to the problem. It was obviously never tested at the factory. The packaging was excellent with no damage in shipping or handling. When I returned it, I checked out a demo unit and discovered the demo unit had black electrical tape applied over one of the document feeder parts. It looked like a neat job performed by a factory technician. My guess is, it has an inherent weakness by design that requires field repair. I am a product design engineer so I inspected all of the parts from a design standpoint to see if there was a defect or obvious fix."
4,Pretty good,But they fail to mention that SSRIs can cause permanent sexual side effects even after discontinuance. Long overlooked by the medical community. Do google search for details.
4,A great biographical history of every aspect of harmonica.,"Definitely a worthy book, if you're interested in a who's who of harmonica. Heavy Breathers covers every side of our favorite instrument, from Big Band to Vaudeville, Jazz to Blues, Classical to Country. It only goes up to around 1994 or so (No John Popper) But it has some interesting stories and interviews from every era in the Harmonica's history, starting from the harp's ancestors, and continuing through to this decade. Think of it as a history textbook on harmonica, and a thorough one at that."
5,What to do with all the soap you've made!,"My mother bought a copy of this book and has now given copies to me, both my sisters and a friend. Between us we have tried most of the recipies in the book and the only problem now is what to do with all the beautiful soap we have created!I found the style and tone of the book made it easy to read and instructions simple to follow. The photographs are glorious and certainly compliment the text. I would thoroughly recommend this book to any soapmaker or anyone else who has not yet experienced the joy of creating your very own soap."
5,Worth Every Penny!,"As a professional soapmaker I own just about every soapmaking book published. ""The Handmade Soap Book"" by Melinda Coss is my favorite and I highly recommend it. The photographs by Emma Peios are sensual and entice you to want to make each and every soap in the book. The recipes are for small batches which works well while you are just learning and when you've found your favorites you can double or triple the recipes. The recipes are well written and pretty much fail-proof. Coss is not a soap snob or purist, rather she uses color freely to produce delightful results. Coss features both vegetable soap and animal-based materials for those who would like to experiment and choose for themselves rather than have the decision made for them which is done in many soapmaking books. Yes, the book is a bit pricey but it is hardcover so it is durable, the photographs are inspirational and the recipes make ""The Handmade Soap Book"" worth every penny."
2,"Beautiful and Awe-Inspiring Photos, but Poor Recipes","This book was the first soap book I purchased, and I found the photographs to be absolutely awe-inspiring. The soaps in the pictures look fabulous, and there are photos of the soapmaking process that would be valuable to a beginner. For one thing there are photos of ""trace"", which eludes most beginners because there are so many conflicting definitions.Unfortunately, I found the recipes to be very disappointing. They are a little on the lye-heavy side, for one thing, and as other reviewers have pointed out, this can cause major problems on small batches. The recipes are also quite complex, and the ones I've tried made soft, short-lived bars. However, they did inspire me to incorporate some of the ideas in my own recipes.I would have given this book a 2 1/2 star rating if that had been available."
3,Some Pretty Photos and Some Not-so-Pretty Ones,"I checked out this book along with Susan Miller Cavitch's The Soapmaker's Companion. The information in this book is presented simply. It's more of a picture book with a few recipes. I found the other book much more informative for a new soapmaker. This one does present some interesting recipes and the photos do help. As others have mentioned, some of the soaps pictured look lye heavy. I recommend checking the recipes with a lye calculator before trying them."
4,The Whole Story is Here !,"Martin Blumenson's Battle of the Generals is the first book that tells the whole story of the missed opportunities offered by the success of Operation Cobra. Some books cover the pros and cons of the deep envelopment (the Seine) verses the close envelopment (Falaise), and some books just cover the close envelopment and lay the blame for the failure to close the gap on the Canadians under Montgomery. This book covers all that plus goes over all the attempts to close the Gap, first at Falaise, then Trun, and Finally Chambois. Martin Blummenson's assessment of the Commanders involved, Ike, Monty, Bradley, and Patton is extremely interesting and objective. He does not blame the failure to effectively close the Gap on the Canadians alone but demonstrates how Ike and Bradley equally share the responsibility with Montgomery. If you are looking for a book that thoroughly explains what happened at the Falaise Gap this is the one I recommend you buy."
5,The Only Thing to Say is WOW!,"I received this unbelievable CD as a gift and it is one of the best additions to my large Jazz collection in the past 5 years. Vikki and company run the range of emotions from sweet and sensitive to sultry and sexy. She keeps a humorous and bantering edge with Richard Downs (bassist). Her voice has exceptional range with with unusual control, and her scatting absolutely must be heard.""Don't Feel My Leg"" had me rolling, and ""Summertime"" was mesmerizing. What is probably most captivating and impressive are her arrangements, which rank with the best I have heard anywhere.Vikki True (and the group as a whole) is a FIND!"
5,As expected,I received this new in box. It was as expected and was very easy to install. This item just works. Nothing bad to say about the product so in my book it is A+.
5,Works as advertised,Received timely and works as advertised and if you continue to make me write 20 or more words I will no longer submit reviews.
3,so so,yea this movie wasnt all that good but not all that bad... the end was what killed it for me... sorry guys lol.
1,Nice idea - HUGE hassle...,"This would only be useful as a second mem card if you have a lot of game saves. It comes with software that lets you compress your game data so that you can fit more than 8MB on the card. The bad news is that you must use the software to use the card at all. Contrary to what others have said it will work with some DVD-based games. I've used it with Jak & Daxter, but it does not work at all with Metal Gear Solid 2. Do yourself a favor and get a Sony card first."
2,Stay away,from this card. It's almost the same price as the Sony card and you have to load their CD every time you turn on the system. The hassle is not worth the small savings.
3,DAMN SONY,"i don't know about the rest of you, but if you don't have a memory card for your PS2, then ur in trouble. don't expect to get one for a long time. sony has every last memory card on back order, and not even NYKO has any in stock. if u find one that is in good condition, then buy it. i mean, what is the point of playing FFX if u can't save a game?"
1,InterAct 8MB Memory Card,Why would anyone buy this memory card?It is not liscensed by Sony which means it should not be used for the PS2.Also it will not look good with your PS2.Play it safe and buy the official Sony memory card so you won't have to worry about a broken memory card.
3,"Pain to use, but....","I picked this item up in a kit because I wanted to be able to save my games somehow. I've only used it for 2 days so far but it seems to be working ok, including on FFX. I know that everyone says not to use it, but when you have a $300+ game system and no memory card, what are you supposed to do? Maybe if Sony got off of their butts, and did something about the supply and demand we wouldn't have to make do with these products."
1,Sucky,"The whole cd thing is a hassle anyway, but my seller didnt even send me the cd, so the card doesnt work. Sometimes you get what you pay for. Just dont be cheap and get a memory card by Sony."
1,Is it this awful?,You have to load a frickin CD every time you start the PS2? It doesn't work with Grand Theft Auto? This card really [stinks] doesnt it?
1,Bad News Bears,"This card is just plain bad. I never had a problem with my Sony memory cards and I had to buy one of these becasue the store only carried this model and I thought - ""how bad can it be?""Well, besides the loading of the stupid memory manager that you have to load each time, there's the added problem that it doesn't work with several PS2 games. Now that the PS2 memory card is cheaper - the official one I mean - you shouldn't waste time nor money on this. Good luck to you if you do."
1,A pain to use and doesn't even work with every games.,"I bough this memory card about 5 months ago since it was less than the official PS2 card. It works fine with most of my games but it's a pain to use because you have to install a stupid CD everytime to run a new game. This memory card will not work with all PS2 games (Metal of Honor Frontline,...) DO not ever buy this memory card, spend a little more on a official ps2 card and save you all the hassles."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Do not buy this memory card. It may be cheaper than the brand name PS2 memory card, but the hassle is not worth the few $$ you save. You have to load it's CD containing the memory manager every time you want to switch games, which ads about 2-3 minutes to loading times. Trust me, go with a brand name PS2 memory card and save yourself the headache!"
2,Not woth the money,Thsi card is only good for one reasons: the price. It's inconvient to have to load a seperate disc just to use the memory card. But that's not the end of it. Not all games (incliuding Final Fantasy X) will not read the card therefore rendering it just a piece of plastic.
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH ALL GAMES,"I bought this card because it was $10 cheaper and claimed to store more using a compression utility that came boxed with it. However, the manufacturer failed to mention two details with the product.1) You *must* boot your PS2 with the disk they give you or the card will not be recognized. This takes about a minute each time you start your PS2.2) Not all games recognize the card even with the disk. I recently purchased Grand Theft Auto 2, and it is totally unable to recognize the card. Now I have to go dump $35 on a sony card, and I'm stuck with this piece of dung too."
1,Don't buy this!,"The card doesn not work with MANY games. In fact, my card does not work with any game I have (Grand Thefy Auto 3, Half-life). This company is ripping people off and refusing to help those stuck with worthless pieces of plastic.Do not buy this - stick to Sony and MadCatz"
1,Ruined My Life,"if only i could pick less than one star...this is by far, the worst product that i have ever wasted my money on in my entire life. this is junk and their stupid memory card ruined my life, don't buy it, it works negative amounts.(i hate it and am very disapointed with those who made/ensorsed/continue to use this product)"
1,What is the deal with no memory cards?,"What is the deal with no memory cards anywhere in the US? I recently purchased the interact/performance 8Mb memory card over the internet and have not received it yet. But now that I have read all of these reviews, I don't think I want it! Out of the all games to buy, I bought the Grand Theft Auto 3 for my husband and now it seems that this card is not going to work for it!"
4,Meet the Robinsons Soundtrack,"If you like Disney, or if you liked this movie, you will like the music"
4,Why isn't this more popular?,"In my opinion, Nu-Clear Sounds is way better than Free All Angels and Trailer, and it's as good as 1977. Tim Wheeler's songs on Nu-Clear are generally similar to those on 1977, but there are less really hard rocking tracks on Nu-Clear, which I think gives it a plus. However, Nu-clear gets a minus in the classic song category. A few tracks on 1977, namely Angel Interceptor and Kung Fu, are spectacular songs. The songs on Nu-Clear Sounds are all very good, but none great. Still, why this cd gets less attention than any of the other three ash albums, I'll never know. Wild Surf, Folk Song and Jesus Says are my three favorites on here. If anyone is considering buying this cd as an introduction to ash, I would probably recommend otherwise and advise you to buy 1977. For any ash fans, this is definately a must have. There are lots of worthwhile songs on here in standard ash rock style."
5,This is Ash's Pinkerton,"This album is great in my book. Then again, all Ash albums are. But that's beside the point. This album got horrible reviews just because it wasn't a ""1977"" carbon copy. It's not fair, this album has some incredible songs on it. Jesus says is an incredibly catchy song, and just like on ""Free All angels"" and ""1977"" they're the type of songs you get stuck in your head for weeks but don't mind because they're so good. Please, pick up this album and give it a chance!"
5,Insanely Orgasmically Awesome,"This album is incredible. I can't honestly say I've bought a CD where every single song is as good as the one before it since Radiohead's 'OK Computer'. Just buy the cd, don't hesitate, think about the money, or anything. Just frikin buy it!"
2,Zzzzz,"This record is sludgy and whiny and tired and boring. Which is a shame, because Ash's first album, 1977, was a mondo pop-punk masterpiece. Buy that instead."
1,disappointing,"Only one good song on this disc: Jesus Says. If you're interested in Ash, buy 1977 or Free All Angels -- much better."
4,As Expected,Ash have followed up their number 1 album 1977 with what can only be described as an astonishing album. Nuclear SOunds is great from the opening track Projects to the last track I'm Gonna Fall. The album contains the singles Jesus Says and Wildsurf and the limited edition single Numbskull. Tim Wheeler has proved that Ash are not one hit wonders and can follow up such a good debut album.
5,surprisingly good,"when i first heard of ""a life less ordinary"",i felt reluctant to buy thier ""nu-clear sound"" as i thought the style would be no different from ""1979"". however,i was wrong,""nu-clear sound"" is of a really different tune!besides the typical rock songs like ""windsurf"",i'm very much impressed by ""folk song"",""i'm gonna fall"",""aphrodite"",they're so melodic & beautiful. &""lowebb"" is really touching .this album is truly a great improvement of ASH."
3,Nu-clear Sounds Causes Explosions,"Ash's latest is a great mix of hard, fast tunes and slower numbers with smooth rhythms. ""Jesus Says"" will make anyone want to get up and dance and ""Numbskull"" is perfect for any mosh pit. Softer songs like ""Aphrodite"" and ""Low Ebb"" give the album a well-rounded sound."
2,kinda disappointing,i love ash but this is my least favorite of their albums... there are a few good songs but overall its kinda weak and doesn't stand out
3,Not Great for Dental Loops...,I bought this for dental loops and it does a decent job at best of keeping the fog down. I would recommend trying another product although I do not know if an product will work for the fogging of surgical loops.
2,good for 15 minutes,"Sea Gold does a good job of cleaning. For me, it prevents fogging for 15 minutes. I tried to follow the instructions exactly as written, but have not found that this treatment is effective. Cat Crap works best for me."
2,Unimpressed,No offense but a little split does a better job and does not sting you eyes if it gets in them.
4,Works well!,"This product works as advertised and seems like the bottle will last a long time. My mask got a little foggy while using it at one point, but I think that it may have more to do with the mask's seal than this defog. I reapplied and I was set for a few more hours."
3,Good de-fogger,"Used this in Kauai. My wife's mask never had any issues, mine did fog up a few times. I just rinsed my mask and it cleared up. As others mentioned a _very_ small amount is enough for two masks. This one bottle will likely last me many years."
1,This book needs division of labor,"The illustrations are good; Fleisher is clearly an adept artist. However, what he doesn't have are creative ideas. It would be better if he could get an ""idea person"" to describe some concepts, and then they could work together on refining it."
2,room for improvement,I found this to be great for the light heart humor. but for those of us with a morbid personality it's not worth it.
2,Unsurprising ways to die,"I bought this book on the strength of the amazing praise for it below. I can only think that the reviewers who laughed themselves sick over it must lead severely humor-deprived lives. While there are a few clever ideas here, all too many are trite, humdrum, and obvious, like an explorer being cooked in a cannibal tribe's pot. Like running into the back of a stopped bus on your bicycle. Like being in an elevator when the cable snaps. You might consider saving your money on this one. I wish I had."
1,lame-sauce,"This book is like watching America's Funniest Home Videos while watching a Piccolo Pete fizzle.Very little cleverness, and doesn't make up for it with decent art. If you're a Gorey/JTHM fan, let this one pass."
5,Way better than the Joy of Cooking,This is up to date. Changes [vastly improves]the way I cook nearly every week. These editors test hundreds of ways to cook a meat loaf--so you don't have to. And kitchen product reviews save tons of time.
5,Forget Gourmet! THIS is the cookbook we all need,"There are about 750 cookbooks in my library. Which one do i keep on the kitchen counter? - ""The New Best Recipe""."
5,"No pictures, no matter...","Initial Response:What? Where are the pictures?1 Month Later:Pictures? Why would I need pictures? I know it will look, smell, and taste amazing.Bottom line:If I were to be marooned in a stocked kitchen and could only take one book, I would take The New Best Recipe."
5,Impossible to rate anything but 5 stars,"One of the most helpful cookbooks I have ever purchased. You learn so much from about cooking by reading all of their trial & error. Each and every recipe I have tried has been excellent - honestly the best of the best. I've given this cookbook to countless people as a gift, and it is helpful no matter what their skill level. Highly, highly recommended for all cooks."
3,Informative but nothing exciting,Every household should have an encyclopedia and this is the cookbook version. It's informative and will give you a good understanding of all things culinary but the recipes are nothing exciting and the book will put you to sleep. It's good to have as a reference but definitely not a go to cookbook.
5,Fun to read,"Enjoy reading ""Cook's Illustrated""? If so, click the Add-To-Cart button immediately, because ""The New Best Recipe"" presents you with hours upon hours of happy reading in that style. Each recipe is accompanied by an article describing the testing, the failures, and ultimately why the success was successful.While the book is highly enjoyable for the reading alone, even better are the recipes themselves once you hit the kitchen.Outstanding."
5,Absolutely perfect cookbook,"Every single recipe in this book is amazing, and extremely easy to follow.Along with the recipes themselves is plenty of information and illustrations explaining the science behind certain ingredients, equipment and cooking methods.The book reads like the television series, which is fantastic. Everything about this book blows me away.I can't say enough...This book is, and I mean this, just as good as ""The Joy of Cooking"". Seriously.I bounce between those two and ignore the 50 or so other cookbooks I now own.Thanks to Cooks Illustrated for making me a GOOD chef!"
5,Everything expect from Cook's Illustrated,Appropriate for the beginning to the expert cook. This book's recipes are well researched and tested. The 'science' behind the recipes is explained and makes sense of how and why the recipe works.
4,Gift ... with a savings,"I purchased this product as a gift - the person had specifically asked for this cookbook. I had originally gone to the Cook's Illustrated website to buy & couldn't believe the price of the book plus the shipping costs. To save on shipping, I went to a Barnes & Noble store and purchased the book for about $35.00. I was pleasantly shocked when I was told by someone to get the book through Amazon where it was considerably less expensive ... and if I spent a certain amount shipping was included. SOLD! Needless to say - the book was returned to Barnes & Noble. Anyone who buys this book through any other service but Amazon is wasting their money."
4,Tons of Recipes!,"Lots and lots of recipes!!! Great way to lear!Just one critic: no pictures! Even though it is easy to follow instructions I need the pictures to feel inspired to cook dishes!Anyway, it's like the bible for recipes so it is ok that it is like that!.Buy it. IT IS A MUST HAVE!!!"
5,only cookbook you'll ever need,The subject pretty much sums this book up for me. I love it and buy it as gifts for everyone I know.
5,Our favorite cookbook,"Over the years, this has become my favorite, and that of both my daughters, cookbook. It's attention to detail and explanations are very informative, and we've only had successes from all the recipes we've tried. If we attempt something new, we let the others know - it's that reliable. This particular purchase was for a wedding gift."
5,Christmas present,This was a present for my wife who absolutely loved it and has spent days poring over it page by page. Obviously recommended.
2,"Good Recipes, If you can locate them","I have owned and used many cookbooks over the years. I bought this one because of the interesting and nearly fool-proof recipes in COOKS ILLUSTRATED magazine. Unfortunately, this book has the absolute worst index of any book, of any kind, I have ever seen, bar none. I find it extremely frustrating and time consuming trying to locate any particular recipe.Too bad they didn't spend a little time looking for the best index or the best contents format -- the recipes don't do you much good if you give up looking for them.For a really useful index, check out THE JOY OF COOKING. What's so hard about doing it right?"
4,all but the brined shrimp,"This is the only cookbook my inlaws have in their vacation house and it is really all you need. For vacations, anyway. Great cookies. Awesome fluffy pancakes, which tend to fall to me. The only thing we have tried that has all-out failed is their recipe which calls for brining shrimp in something like 3 1/2 cups salt and water. Needless to say the shrimp was ruined and inedibly salty. Must have been a typo?"
5,It truly is the BEST cookbook,"This book gives not only the how to, but the why. You might be tempted to substitute in a recipe, but they may tell you what happened when they tried that substitution. Be sure to try the beef stew (red wine tenderizes it), the excellent fried rice, the apple pie, the biscuits... there are so many good ones. Haven't had a dud yet.If you only could have one cookbook, this should be the one."
5,Great Cookbook!,"THis is a great cookbook! I've tried a dozen recipes so far and all have been very good. The recipes include on top of the ingredients the reasons for doing things in a specific order or for choosing a specific cut of meat, etc... This is very helpful in understanding why and how things go together. This cookbook makes a quite intricate recipe much more manageable...."
5,great cookbook,LOVE THIS BOOK! My husband and I recieved this cookboook for a gift several years ago and have always found it informative and helpful when preparing items we have never cooked or wanting to shake up an old recipe. We purchased this cookbook for a bride to be and feel it will be a great asset to any kitchen whether your a seasoned cook or someone just starting out!
4,Great book. Poor index and pics.,"My rating is 4.5 stars of 5 stars.I highly recommend this book and I bought it based on the great reviews.I am happy I bought it, I love the fact it's like an encyclopedia. I can't wait to read it all. This book is everything I am looking for and I believe EVERY kitchen should have one.It's big and this is great cause u get more for your buck. I am happy this book is 1000+ pages long.I minused half a star for 2 reasons:1) No pics available except at the beginning of each chapter there is 1 single black and white pic.2) I didn't quite like the index at all.but nothing is perfect and this is as perfect as it gets.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!"
2,Too much like a textbook,"The recipes in here could be cut into a 5th of the book. I've made a recipe from here for biscuits, and it was tasteless and gross. I followed the recipe exactly. If you want a book by the Editors of Cook's Illustrated Magazine, I recommend their family cookbook which doesn't have the longwinded explanations. It's a 3 ring spiral bound book, which I wish I'd bought instead."
2,Less than expectation,"It has no great receipes,it is only a very classic recipes done with small change.Book is not that illustrative as mentioned by others reviews"
3,The New Best Recipe,Not enough recipes~ too much explanation going on! : ( i would not recommend this magazine to a friend...i would probably purchase it at a used book store or at a Good Will!
4,Solid Recipes,"I have to confess, as excited as I was to receive this cookbook, I was slightly disappointed when I first skimmed through it. I loved the detail given for each recipe, but the recipes themselves seemed daunting and more for special occasions rather than everyday cooking. I resolved to give it a try, however, and I'm so glad I did. The New Best Recipe staff really did their homework and it shows in the recipes; they are absolutely incredible! The cooking techniques are well explained, though they can be a bit time consuming. However, I cannot agree with other reviewers that this will be ""the only cookbook you'll ever need""; the recipes are too involved for everyday cooking, particularly for this mom of two. I do think this is a solid cookbook and a worthwhile purchase; it will certainly be my ""go-to"" cookbook for special occasions and guests."
4,Good Heartfealt Hard Rock,"This is another work of art by Oleander. To me, their best work by far is the ""Unwind"" album. The song ""Jimmy Shakur Day"" here is from that ""Unwind"" record. This band is not heavy metal and neither is this cd. Considering that, this is not light rock or pop either. It is more comparable in style to bands like Candlebox, Collective Soul, and Black Lab. If you like this, check out Black Lab's ""Your Body Above Me""."
5,Great book,"This is a great historical account of a 1955 atrocity against the Greek, Jewish and Armenian communities in Istanbul. It takes into account all the historical background of the day, back to the Treaty of Lausanne, which was smashed by the Turks when they implemented anti-Greek laws and began to expel Greeks as a result. This book takes historical context fully into account. It is indispensable to all interested in the Turkish-Greek conflict through the present day."
4,I'd be a guest anytime!,"I LOVED this - although I've been to some great parties here in the city, I'd adore to make it to some of these parties. I thought the ideas for creating your own event were great and in fact, read a story on the front of the New York Times Styles section on Sunday about someone who did follow her suggestions and had the best party - despite initial reservations about it being worth the effort! The photograpy is great - it's Jessica Craig Martin's style - she pokes her camera at people - it's not supposed to be perfect - but more snapped on the go. I think this book makes a great gift - I'm also planning my Valentine's day party now!"
3,Good Story... Okay book.,Final Fantasy: The Spirit Within is a book based on the movie. While the book carries the storyline of the movie fairly well the writing is not as good as a full novel. The storyline is that earth was hit by a meteorite that carried the spirits of aliens to earth. On earth the aliens steal the spirits of the humans that they catch. As a result the human population is decimated. Aki is a scientist that is trying to find eight spirits that can create a wave that can force back the invaders. She is also infected by the alien threat which makes her task much more difficult. The movie looks awsome and the book give the storyline okay but this is not the greatest movie novelization that Ihave read but it is not horrible. If you want to find out what happens in the movie I would recommend reading it but if not see the movie when it comes out.
1,Disappointing. Period.,"I must say, I was thoughroly disappointed by this book. As a writer myself, after I saw the movie, despite the book beign accurate, it was dull and badly written, trying to give the characters ""other names(Example: Aki=young scientist, young woman) and the emotions were not played out in the book as they were in the movie. Such a...well, crappy book, is a horrible disappointment to a movie like Final Fantasy, which i enjoyed immensely. I suggest finding ANY other Final Fantasy book beside this one...it's just plain bad, and a complete waste of money. And, on that note, the book skips two very important factors to the life force of this plot: the kissing scene and the ending was not thoroughly accurate. See the movie and/or get another book."
4,Review of 'Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within',"Based on the insanely popular videogame series of the same name, The Spirits Within is the first time a Final Fantasy story has been set on Earth. On a distant planet in a far away galaxy allows the reader to accept some of the more outlandish ideas that Final Fantasy stories embrace, but when the near future of Earth is concerned there needs to be an effort made to make the fantasy at least have a basis in reality. This book does not do that. Though it was a good read and will make for a good movie, as a novel it falls flat when you take a moment and think about just what you are reading. From the way Aki deals with the infection of Gray to the nonsense ending it's hard to take the story seriously at time. At one point near the end Dr. Sid exclaims how logical and simple it all is. He couldn't have been more wrong."
3,"Ok, but buttons get stuck after awhile","I have 3 dual shock ps2 controllers, and it never fails, after a while of having it, the buttons get stuck, the first one the R1 button stopped having force to it.. so you would have to press it extra hard to use it... now on this second one the analog button be gettin stuck, it used to mess me up all the time when playing socom2 online... now this 3rd one.. the R2 button gets stuck... it's annoying."
5,Control,This control is as good as the one that comes with the system. It will help you beat your child at any game.
5,"It's Good, it works... i like it!","Well, the first time i bought something in amazon was this control, i needed it, mine was broken, so i tried it and it's really good. It works perfectly, and for me that's all because i live in venezuela so i have no way to send it back if it doesnt work. It's good, i like the black color, and use it to play on my PS one while i wait for my PS2 to be delivered."
2,ok,"after 4 uses of a new controller, it started to have problems. should have gone with the logitech wireless controller"
1,Buyer beware!,"I just received and tested a PS2 controller I purchased from the ""Kit Kit Trading Co"", and it doesn't work.Only the Start and Select buttons and the Analog Sticks are functional --- ALL the other buttons behave as though they're all being ceaselessly pushed-down at once, and they don't respond to any user input. Needless to say, it's totally useless.I chose to buy from ""Kit Kit"" because their product was inexpensive. It just goes to show that when something looks too good to be true, it ALWAYS IS."
2,Great..... Until it dies on you,"I've had the DS2 that came with my PS2 since Feburary. The layout and size of the controller does not upset me. In fact, I liked the layout and size. It fits my hands perfect and I don't get major hand cramps after playing for hours **cough**XBOX**cough**. No it's not that that bothers me. It gave up on me after a year. I'm quite impressed that it lasted more that a year, but the way it quit working is the reason I hate it. First off, the part where the wire meets the controller gets very loose. You can push it in and pull it out. I think this is the main reason I get the ""INSERT CONTROLLER"" message when I'm trying to play my games. Some days it works, some days it doesn't. I guess a third party controller is best for me. Better luck next time, Sony.Rating: 2.5/5"
1,Sony Playstation 2 Dualshock Controller Black,"Just like the last 3 Sony controllers I bought, this one sucks. As soon as I plugged it in, and turned on the game, the person I was trying to control starting moving backwards at a pretty fast clip. When I got it to stop moving backwards, he starting moving to the right just as fast. It was impossible to control him. I have since purchased a controller from Alienware, and it works perfect. Sony sucks. They have lost all interest in quality control. They are going on their name alone. I have 2 sons who have exactly the same problem with thier Sony controllers. I was going to send it back, but I just figured it would be a hassle, so I threw it away. Forget Sony if you want anything with high quality. I am not someone who abuses the game counsels or any thing that has to do with them. I am 61 years old and have been playing video games for a looooooong time. And my sons are 32 years old and 41 years old. They are not abusive little kids."
2,Dual shock controller for PS2,There is no difference between this controller and the one for PS1. It is just away to make more money off people.
5,The best controller on the market,"I feel that the dual shock controller is the best on the market. It fits comfortably in my hands. It is not big and bulky link the n64 controller. I like the rubber analog sticks, my brother acutual got a bad blister from the n64 from playing mario party. The rumble feature is good because you do not have to put a bulky pack in the back that eats up bateries. The buttons are well placed and easy to get to. It looks like nintendo lerned their lesson because the game cube controller is simaler. The dual shock II controller has a long coard, which is good when you want to sit on a couch that is far away. I have little experence with the sega controller, but when i used it in the store it felt bulky and needed an external rumble pack. I don't know why the x box has a dreamcast like controller. Overall i think it is the best controle because it is confortable, has a good layout, and is light."
3,Sony brand PS2 controller,"L1 and R1 buttons still tend to get stuck, not very durable.Average lasts six to nine months."
5,it fits like a glove,"this is what ALL video game console controllers should feel like - all of the buttons are easy to access and are ergonomically placed.The controller feels like it should be part of my hand and I don't have to fight to maintain control of my games.N64, Xbox, Gamecube, SNES, NES, Genesis, etc... all have awkward controllers full of buttons/sticks placed in the wrong locations.The Sony branded Dual Shock 2 controllers are a STRONG BUY for any PSX/PS2 owner."
2,Shoddy and lacking imagination,"I have played SSX to death. I have never abused my controller. Two facts. After 5 months of use the R1 and R2 shoulder buttons are prone to sticking. I just began playing Starfighter, and my admittedly small hands are still too large for the controller. Starfighter is the 1st game I have played that requires you to always have both thumbs on each analog stick, and let me tell you, your hands end up getting scrunched together into am uncomfortable position, and it is always tough to move the stick towards your body. The controller is too small when you are faced with using both analog sticks. Sony was wise to not change the controller to much, so as not to confuse the less avid gamer. But I expect more. Innovation and buttons that do not stick would be nice. Terrible job Sony. Couple this with the fact that SSX and Starfighter are the only two innovative and fun games on the console, and you have to wonder if Sony will become the next Sega."
1,PS2 Controller,"After using this controller for 1 week, it shows wear and missing button hits as have all my other PS2 Controllers have. They don't make things like they use to as the old saying goes. I primarily use this for MADDEN 2010 on the PS2 and the buttons stick. I wouldn't have thought that I would have problems with a Sony Controller but this is the 7th one I have bought in the last 2 years. At least through Amazon they are $[...] compared to $[...] at WalMart."
3,Too small...,"I don't like the Playstation controller as much as the controllers for the other consoles. Why? Because the Playstation controller is too small. The PS2 controllers don't seem ""analog"" either, the only thing analog on them is probably the joysticks. I like the Dreamcast and GameCube controllers better because they are a good size and everything is in a place that you can reach. Aren't there any PS2 controllers that have an extended grip or something? So how about if Sony realizes that most of the PS2 gamers are 12+ and not 9 year olds!"
2,Broken controllers,"Got the PS2 controller in the mail, received it quickly and at first glance it worked well. After realizing that some of the buttons didn't work, I looked at the prongs. They sent me a broken PS2 remote. Thanks, it goes well with the PS1 remote that the other guy sent me with my PS2. Least I can still manual DVD's on it."
2,an unsatisfied customer,"When I first purchased the PS2 dual shock controller from Amazon, I was under the impression that I was purchasing a Sony product--similar to the image that was being advertised on the website. However, to my amazement, the package that I received was a bootlegged version; I felt like I was duped. Unfortunately, weeks later in my follow-up feedback, it was finally brought to my attention that the item was not an original Sony product. In the end, I wished that the seller could have been more forthcoming about the product, otherwise I might not have purchased it in the first place. I guess that's what happens when you pay $7.50 for it; it was just too good to be true.Overall the controller is still compatible with the PS2 system and the item was shipped, brand new, in a timely fashion. If you are looking for a cheaper alternative to the genuine version then this is the way to go, otherwise do not even bother."
4,Very Awesome,This is a really cool item because it allows pressure sensitivity which means I can do more with the four right buttons because it measures how hard I press. Really Nice!
5,Good Controller.,"Controller is good, but a little too expensive on my opinion. Today the controller should be worth only $5 than anything more. Controller has good design and good response when i press a button. Overall great controller, i recommend this for anyone."
1,PS2 Controllers,"I am very dissapointed with this purchase. I ordered 2 of the controllers and 1 of them didn't work. I tried to contact the company about this, but unfortunately they never got back with me."
3,cONTROLLER,"IT IS NOT THE BEST, IF YOU ASK ME DURAL SHOCK ONE IF THE BEST BUT SOME GAME YOU MUST HAVE 2, THAT IS THE ONLY REASON I GOT THE CONTROLLER. tO HOLD BUTTONS YOU HAVE TO PUSH THEM REALY HARD FOR THEM TO WORK."
5,Great controler!!!,"What more can you ask of from a controller besides it being wireless and even MORE comfortable. Well, the comfort is close to as good as its going to get for the money (which is extremely good) and the technology for a reactive wireless controller is still not as good as one would like. Sony did a great job creating this controller!"
5,Great Controller,The Dual Shock II controller is a great must have item. Stay away from the second source units as they are not nearly as accurate as the Sony. The analog sticks are great and the button layout is all well placed unlike the big awkward X-Box and N64 controllers. The Dual Shcok just seems to fit the hands much better. It seems that while X-box failed to do any world market test on their controller Sony did not. I do not own an X-box but have played some games for it. Sony has a great idea and design period.
5,Dualshock 2 Controller,"This is probably the cheapest controller and also the best. It is small and sleek, easy for your fingers to maneuver. Maybe it gets a little bit sweaty but to get a controller with a fan cost almost double."
5,simply the best,"This is no cheap plastic [junk] the other 3rd party makers use to make their controllers. This is the real thing! Offers excellent feedback and responsive from the joysticks and the buttons. just the best, your money won't be spent in vain. The others have [low-quality] joysticks that are either too loose or too tight, this one is just right! Did I mention it was also hardy?"
1,The worst controller on the market,"This controller is terrible! It dosn't fit in your hand like all the other controllers, and the buttons are set up poorly. If you want a good controller, get the Xbox."
2,It's just a controller and a pretty crappy one at that,"Hell you need it to play games and that is the only reason you need one of these, third party controllers are better and not as flimsy but most won't work with your ps2 so your stuck with the duel shock 2. My main problems with this thing is how breakable it you can't squeeze it to hard accidently drop it because it will break it has bappened to me many times, you must be really careful with it or you will be stuck payin the outrageous price twenty bucks which is too much for how breakable it is. Other than it works."
1,Whoever made this has very small hands,"This controller is too small. After about an hour of playing with it, my hands will be sore. They wont be sore just for a few hours, they will be sore for a few days. Sony needs to make their controllers bigger. The Gamecube controller and even Xbox's huge controller feels better than this. My reccommendation is buy a 3rd party controller or just not buy the PS2. The PS2 isn't that great anyway and it way overhyped."
1,Super goo,"I really like the product, I love the service and everything.Amazon has topped any other intenet services, and thats that."
1,"PS2 game me carpal tunnel syndrome, Stay Away......please !","I unwittingly bought a PS2, not knowing that I'd get a god awfull small game controller. I used it for a month and now I can't hardly move my hands or my fingers. Don't buy Playstation 2. They've ruined my future. I'm writing this review right now by using a voice typing program that Microsoft published especially for people who've ended up in my poor situation. (P.S. buy an xbox instead, their controllers are much bigger)"
5,Great controller (no shock there),"Although almost exactly the same as that of the PSX/PS1, it still is excellent. Its design makes it fit perfectly in many people's hands. A Dual Shock feature adds ""shock"" features in games that support them, by rumbling in your hands. Two analog sticks are great for accurate gaming, and Sony even stiffened the sticks to increase precise movements. Finally, Sony has added analog type features to ALL buttons. In games such as Ridge Racer V, you can push harder or lighter on buttons to specify your movements. For Ridge Racer V, the harder you pres on the accelerate button, the fater you go, etc.All in all, a VERY good and VERY worthwhile buy."
4,Nice and solid,"Hasn't broken down yet, but my others of the same brand have in the past. Simple controllers. The default that comes with the system."
4,What can I say? The Dualshock,"Standard PS2 controller, honestly the only design I've ever used extensively.Got it for my PC and have logged in maybe 100 hours on various games, with about 50-60 in Super Street Fighter IV. This is the converter I use, by the way (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F6BGXY/), and JoyToKey is my binder, which works great for my purposes. Speaking of Street Fighter, it's not really the best controller for fighting games, I just happen to use it.Anyway, seems to work as I've always expected. $20 is a little steep, but the quality is pretty good. You can probably find a few decent knock offs if you're after something cheaper, though."
5,The best Controller,I think that the Dual Shock 2 Controller from Sony is the best ever. For my Playstation 2 I buy nothing but the best which is SONY. I you want a Controller get the Dual Shock 2 Controller from Sony.
1,Broken.,"I wanted to like it because I needed it but it just had to come broken.One of the connector pins is missing and it's the same problem with my old controller.I wish the shipper would have really checked the controller before sending it, especially when they said it was ""like new""Such a shame."
1,Sony sure knows how to make defects,"This item only have 90 days warranty, no big problem during this period, however after a while all the L and R buttons got stuck and the analog stick if used often tend to be hard to move. All in all may be buying a buget one and replace it frequently is an option."
1,playstation 2 dualshock controller,"The controller that i recieved was broken,it was suppose to be in very good condition but it wasnt.He said he would replace the item but failed to do so."
3,Dual Shock 2 controller for playstation 2,Package arrived in excellent condition. I would definitely buy from you again. Thanks
1,I hate these controllers,When i bought a playstation 2 pack it came with these controllers....2 months later my wires were all messed up... Buy the predator wireless controllers 2 for 50.00 which makes them only 25.00 EACH...Thats only 5.00 more then these controllers....
2,already broken 2 controllers,"this are made poorly. i've already broken 2 controllers so i've had to go get 3rd party ones. the logitech ones stink. so i really like the pelican performance.these sony ones are cheap. everyone but me likes them. when i got my sony ones, the x button broke on both controllers so buyer be ware."
5,"It is, after all, just a controller","But it's still pretty good at it. The rumble part works nicely (even though that's not all that important to me) and the analog controllers respond nicely. Also, I haven't encountered the thing that was on the first analog controller I got (a non-dual shock for PS) where the led showed two different colors and would lock out your D-pad on green. In any case, get the offical Sony controller because it is made by Sony, probably won't invalidate your warranty (there's probably a clause in there somewhere that if you use third-party accessories and then burn out your controller port within the 90-day period you can't get it replaced, of course I don't know that), and will last longer. I've still got a good working digital controller I bought with my PS several years ago, so Sony stuff really does last."
5,It's a PS2 Controller,"I bought this to work with my PS2 emulator and a PS2/USB adapter. Controller worked right away (running on Windows 7). It's a Lic PS2 Controller what more do you want. If you are not a fan of a PS2 Controller than this item is not for you. Can't see how this would get bad reviews, does exactly what it should do nothing more nothing less.If you want a Controller for a PS3 this may not be a smart buy due to the connection and the lack of the 6-Axis but if you need a REAL PS2 contoller for a PS2 or an emulator than this is a perfect buy.P.S. After playing with a XBOX 360 controller for years now I forgot how much I prefer the PS2 style more."
3,as good as buying blind.,"the L3 and R3 sticks were damaged, like if somebody bit them. though the controller itself works perfect. next time I'd preffer to see an actual picture of what I'm buying and not a generic picture."
5,the best of the best,This is the best videogame controller ever. It is light weight and is comfortable. This is better than Xbox and the Gamecube controller. A kid from 3 and can hold these just fine.
5,"Takes a licking, keeps on ticking!","I got one of these when I originally got my PS2 for Christmas 2002, and it has survived nearly two years of intensive, daily use. I've had absolutely no problems whatsoever with it, and I also haven't had any problems with the second controller I got about a year ago for two-player gaming. All the buttons, including the shoulder buttons, are easily accessible, the joysticks are comfortable and easily operated, and the vibration function is noticable witout being jarring or annyoying. In brief, this controller is a success. Much more comfortable and easier to use (...) in my opinion."
4,Playstation 2,"The extra controller has two broken controlls, and by the time we pay to ship it back, it is cheaper to buy anothere one at the store."
5,An awesome controller,"Sony has made the best controller ever. I never used anything better than this. The Gamecube controller's buttons are different sizes which makes it harder to use and the Xbox controller is too big and bulky. The PS2 controller is comfortable, light, and easy too use because the buttons are the same size (the circle,square,X,and triangle buttons). It the perfect controller for racing, shooting, and sports game like Tony Hawk 3. Actually its great for any kind of game. Its especially good for fighting games like Tekken Tag. I recomend this controller for any serious gamer. Go with Sony."
5,this controller is great!!!,this controller is great because it is the only psone and two controller that is touch senstive. it also fits my hands perfectly... i think all ps2 owners should get this controller. you really won't regret it.
5,"Cuisinart Chef's Class Nonstick 9"" Tube Pan",This pan browns your cakes evenly and with the commerical weight your cake come out lighter and the smoother textured is fabulous!
3,Classic Bakeware,Miss leading!! I thought the pan was one piece. Disappointed when received and it was two piece. Should have been stated!!!
1,Not as advertised,"9-inch tube pan is actually an angel food cake pan and it is 2 pieces, if it had been advertised as 2 pieces I would not have purchased it. I bought 2 pans, my husband encouraged to try because of the weight of the pan, but of course, it didn't work, it leaked in my oven. I only returned the pan I didn't use."
5,WONDERFUL!,You will love this cake pan - I bake a almond pound cake and prep the pan using crisco and sugar in place of flour - it comes out perfect every time with the help of this awesome pan.
5,happy baker,"I have recently started doing a lot of baking-thanks to my husband for new cookware and my Kitchenaid mixer. I am becoming a little ""Betty Crocker"" an have become very good at making pound cakes. I purchased this pan an I am very pleased with it. My cake comes out easily every time."
2,Description incomplete,Seems OK but description failed to mention that it was two piece. Not what we really wanteted. Have not actually used it.
1,This CD should be lost never to be found again!,"I bought Andy's CD ""Five Star Motel"" and loved it, so without previewing this CD I thought it has to be good because I loved his other CD. This is the worst $5 dollars I have ever spent, there maybe one song worth listening to the rest are terrible, nothing like ""Five Star Motel"". I was hoping for something similar and was deceived."
4,Cool products,This is a great product. Works well for mosquitoes and biting flies. Too expensive per application for regular use but for occasional use when you don't have spray or rub-on products available it's great.
5,Gentle Solutions,"Bronwyn has captured a process that applies to me individually. It is simple, and clear. Her message is powerful and meaningful. I appreciate her sharing herself and demonstrating the application of living a spiritual solution to weigh-loss. I love the shift from the lie to the truth, which is huge in over-coming food addiction. Emotional eating no longer creates a helpless and hopeless feeling for me, as remembering to use the principles and suggestions in Bronwyn's book empowers me to make healthy decisions."
3,Great gift idea but probably not practical for actual use.,Like the title of my review suggests.... the chopsticks are made of 2 different materials (metal and wood). the wooden part doesn't seem to be very tightly attached to the metal portion. ALso the wood is not of high quality meaning the chopsticks feel oddly heavy on the top when actually holding it to use.The option to engrave however is very nice and will make this a great personalized gift.
3,"Tell It The Way It Is -- OK, It's Pretty Lame","This one was a real disappointment! After loving ""Gettin' Together"" (see my review), I was thinking two albums on one CD from the mid-60s would be more adventurous and just plain more music. But ""Tell It The Way It Is"" is basically a smaller version of Ellington's band playing music that was interesting ten years earlier, in the mid-50s. The title track by pianist Walter Bishop, the album's supposed selling point, is an univentive boogie-woogie meets swing number. It only gets worse on the warped concept album ""Cleopatra."" Without going into the gory details, it's basically just boring, commercial soul/organ jazz despite a lineup that features Kenny Burrell, Hank Jones and Roy Haynes. I can't bring myself to give this CD only two stars because I know there are people out there who will enjoy this release. But for my money, it's better to get ""Gettin' Together"" or Gonsalves' album with Sonny Stitt, ""Salt and Pepper."""
1,hot handle,"Although this tea kettle was just the right size and very attractive for my kitchen - the handle was hot to the touch. The description stated heat resistant handle, and this was not true. Using medium heat, the handle was still too hot to touch. Very disappointing."
1,"NOT ""chip resistant""","Even though the product description says ""chip resistant"" enamel, my tea kettle had a huge chip when I took it out of the box."
5,A Poetry Voyage,"A beautiful, touching and in the end surprising collection of poems that at first seems to be about loneliness and loss, the failures of love and the pain of memory, but that upon fuller reading builds into something even more. A voyage from childhood, parents and home to adulthood, lovers and finding a way to live. Not only in the narrative of the poems, but also in their rhythms, as if more air was being let in as the book goes on, ending with the lines: ""the wide open door; the endless crossing..."" As if in the early part of the book survival is not assured and by the end, with all the sadness, it is. This reader was very moved."
2,Hope you don't need parts!!!,"I've owned one of these watches for about four years. The pins that hold the links together are falling out. No big deal you say? Well, try buying those cheap little pins from Luminox. They cost about $40 for a few of them. Luminox does not support its products in any reasonable way."
5,Wonderful recordings,"James Levine has always been an exciting conductor to listen to. His recordings are always interesting and delightful to listen to. Here, we encounter Levine conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in Dvorak's two most popular symphonies. The result is delightful. Levine, always a proponent of large sonics, has created big, heavy sounding versions. But at the same time, the symphonies are not poorly performed; rather, Levine brings out the brass without sacrificing the other sections of the orchestra. However, as another reviewer noted, the sound quality is a bit lacking. The strings, especially in the 7th, sound rather nasal and overly focused. The ninth is a bit more balanced. Still, don't let a slight recording problem turn you away from this CD. Highly recommended."
3,Preserving a Legacy,"Unlike Chapman's other books on Christian living which generally take on an ""outdoors"" theme, this is primarily centered on passing on knowledge to his son.How many men wish their fathers had done the same?One essay. One Page. One Paragraph. Anything?Chapman records his personal thoughts and ideas while always keeping them Christ-centered. Its hard to go wrong living a Christ-centered life.I read this as prep work for reading Dr. Dobson's ""Bringing up Boys"". I wanted an insider's view of raising a Godly son, before I went with technical data. My 5 year old is already quickly becoming a young man and its helpful to understand the importance even now of passing on a legacy.But is this a good book?I found some nuggets worth keeping. Maybe the biggest thing I've learned however, is its time to set down some things I want my own child to learn."
2,dont mess with the songs!,"this album would be really good if the same annoying saxophone intro wasnt added into the 'herbalist' part, and the same annoying keyboard beats weren't added into the 'energy' part of the artists versions. why they felt they needed to mess with the original versions of the songs, i dont know, but it makes what would have been a good compilation really annoying to listen to"
5,Good for Small Dogs,"I've been using this brand for a few months now. They work fine for two small dogs. I haven't had any leakage issues, but then again my dogs don't pee that much. They are a good deal for the price and I will purchase again."
5,Best Puppy Pads,"You can't tell I have six pups in my house. These pads help train your pets. They are absorbent and minimize odors. The price is a bargain, too."
2,Thin and small,"I have tried several pee pee pads before, and this one is horrible. This pad does not hold the pee at all and my dog is only 5 lbs.It's very very thin and small."
2,Comfort pads,"These pads worked more to comfort me, than the puppy actually using them. She did use one one time. Just knowing they were around and she might use them helped. I still had to remember to take her out very often."
4,Makes you wonder about what happened then and now,"Great album to listen to and really stimulates thoughts of the past, in dorms in the 60s and 70s when music was always blaring and lived with this album being one of the big hits. Sad to say you could do anything in those day to be expiramental and break barriers; all gone today imagination and creativity like this; this music clearly reflects those long gone new exciting thrills of discovery in that time, many years ago. And the key 2 songs, Knights in White Satin and Tuesday Afternoon, of course, hold up very much aided by this CD's clear presentation which makes these songs and the whole album new again. True vestige of the mid twentieth century romantic rebellion. A curiosity piece for young people to hear to understand the world of no limits back then--strange but good to corrupt the complacent sensibilities being inculcated today by the grandparents (and their kids) who grew up in this inspiring time. What happened?"
2,"Great music, horribly remastered","I can confirm that the negative comments regarding the remastering apply fully to the SACD layer. The sound on the SACD layer is so aggressive and raw edged that I find it unpleasant to listen to. But that doesn't mean this CD is not worth buying. Surprisingly, CD layer actually sounds pretty decent, though still less good than then one would hope for on a legendary recording made by the sound engineers at Decca during its golden age. Such a shame. If you are buying it for the SACD sound, don't waste your money. On the other hand, the additional materials/outtakes are well selected and well recorded, and that is really the best reason to buy this production, rather than for the remastered sound."
3,"SACD-Days of Future Passed, Moody Blues","It was a $30 disappointment. I have an SACD-CD Player and am hooked up to a good quality receiver in a multi-channel format(6 RCA's). Other than ""Tuesday Afternoon"" and ""Nights in White Satin"" and to some degree ""Evening"" the material hasn't held up and the mono mixes and other ""filler"" songs that bulk up the offering are a waste of time. If you want a better overall experience- get Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"" or Elton John's ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" both have good multi-channel mixes and to me are listenable start to finish-both in material and audio quality.."
2,Horrid Version,"If you are a fan, avoid the DERAM versions at all cost. If you are new to the Moody Blues music, then get whatever version you can to just experience the experience.Unfortunely, the Deram discs (at least the ones I have) suffer from a bad mix. Sounding muted at the dynamic tracks, and then way over the top on surround stage with no center stage on other tracks. (of course I know it was recorded on quad to begin with, but how can you almost completely lose some of the spoken parts?)I've heard much better from lesser disks on lesser systems.Point being that this is supposed to be a ""better"" version. ""[ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED] [ORIGINAL RECORDING REISSUED]""NOT even close!!"
3,Too bright a sound.,"While there is much to admire to this SACD (clarity), it reveals anything but a warm and full sound when it comes to the string section. I don't know if this is a limitation of the original recording or something else. It is distracting from other versions of this recording."
1,Junk going into the trash!,"I thought this product was a great bargan but found out differently. First off, it does not come with a manual or parts list so if it breaks, you're out of luck.The tool has no power so even when cutting into pine, with very little preasure, you can stop the blade from spinning.After making about sixteen cuts on this brand new joiner, the bolt that holds the blade in fell apart causing the blade to fall out which in turn destroyed the blade.Not having a parts manual, you can't get replacement parts.It is junk. Spend a little extra money and buy a brand name. You can get a ""Craftsman"" for about $99.00"
2,I don't know...,"How can it be the best of 2003 when in my opinion the 3 best videos of the year are not on it. They are Liz Phair's ""Why Can't I"",Fountains of Wayne's ""Stacy's Mom"" (the last two are available on CD NOW 14) and OutKast's ""Hey Ya!"". I hope all three make the next collection along with Beyonce with Jay-Z's ""Crazy In Love"" (the brassline is an earworm of mine)Of course I remember the old days of the early 1980's when MTV actually PLAYED videos..."
2,Now this is what i call Mediocre,"well, pop isn't my most favorite genre. well, let's face it. i hate most pop. however, i'd buy this DVD just for these two vids if it were $6-86.More To Life- Stacie Orrico -- one of the better pop vids (with a bit of a message) next to, say, Pink's Family Portrait that comes to mind.9.Going Under- Evanescence -- really ""cool"" video with a goth'd up Amy Lee surrounded by normal looking people that are (one way you can look at it) ugly on the inside, or something...and maybe5.Sweetest Sin- Jessica Simpson -- so-so song, made tollerable by Low Hanging Fruit. in other words, scantily clad popsinger. then again, i don't really ""know"" Jessica Simpson at all compared to the little i know of the others..."
2,Very Campy,"I was surprised at how campy and silly this was, not at all the darker Batman shows I was used to seeing, oh well for $2 it wasn't bad."
4,DVD -- when?!!!,"I consider the 60s episodes superior to the 70s shows that have been released. I know the 70s have Adam West and Bruce Ward as voice talent, but the 70s shows were too corny. Plus, the 60s shows were very reflective of the Batman series at that time. Catwoman is even in her short-lived green catsuit! It's bad enought the 60s live action show isn't on DVD, but at least the animated series should be."
5,Great Batman Cartoon!!!,"I remember watching the Batman/Superman Hour when I was in 1st Grade. I LOVED it then and I STILL do! I JUST wish that it would come out on DVD or Blue-ray with the Superman cartoons that went with it in the B/S Hour. It's a pain watching it on the computer. These are TOTALLY uncut...how can I tell...I watched the old video from the 80's and I watched the Superman/Batman Adventures on Boomerang and both were cut. These cartoons had everything back ACCEPT for the Batman/Superman Hour beginning which I'd LOVE to see again. PLEASE...PLEASE...PLEASE...bring them onto DVD ASAP as well as Season 2 and 3 of Superman from 1967 & 1968, the Superboys from those periods, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Fantastic Voyage, etc. That's when cartoons were GREAT!"
3,Second time around is not a charm.,"My vision of Netherfield Park with the former inhabitants, Charles and Jane Bingley, will never be the same after reading this version of the family. Netherfield Park Revisited is too centered in the next generation to suit me. The story line is slow and predictable. Netherfield Park is just an obscure spot on the English landscape where Jason Bingley, we are led to believe, desires to live more than anything else. The author does present the older generation of Pride and Prejudice in their true character, but their actual role in the story was not enough to want me to read any of the other Pemberley Chronicles."
2,Not Jane Austen,"One of the reasons Jae Austen has been so popular - with me, at any rate - is her sly sense of humor and ability to skewer pomposity with a single line or observation. She comes on like a sweet, demure maiden, but there's a sharp observer of human frailty in there who jumps out at unexpected moments. Sadly, this ""sequel"" has none of the wit and acuity of the original Austen. I found the characters stuffy and a boring lot of goody two-shoes. The opportunities to draw characters who are more than two-dimensional are missed - even avoided. No confrontations, no drama - even Amelia-Jane's flight and accident are related bloodlessly in retelling rather than exploring the drama that must have gone on in the carriage. I'm glad I just had this from the library, or I would have considered it money ill spent. It won't end up on my bookshelves."
4,A new character _ Jonathan Bingley takes centre stage,"An interesting idea- to revisit Netherfield Park, the original setting for the romance of Jane Bennet and Mr Bingley and who better to revisit it than Jonathan Bingley- son of Jane and Charles.An intelligent, handsome yet modest young man with a promising career faces the possible destruction of his marriage. The novel tells the story of his efforts to balance his peronal ambition with his family loyalties. He returns to Netherfield hoping it will resolve his problems, but he has not foreseen the disaster that awaits.A love story with a twist- I am happy to echo the words of a reviewer- Jenny Scott who wrote "" I could not put down this book"""
3,Netherfield Park Revisited,"While the story is a continuum of a delightful series, the editing of this ebook is sorely lacking in detail.Many lines are written without proper letter spacing, amking one pause to ensure that one is reading correctly.Considering this was not one of the bargain books, I find this ommission of quality control disappointing."
4,A Non - Hunter Review,"First off I must admit that I've never shot anything bigger than a crow. And dragonflies, like Capstick.But Capstick's yarns are ripping. The hunting stories make you feel as if you've actually been there.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that my interest is more in hunting and fishing stories. But several of the articles are technical pieces on ammunition, which I have no interest in."
5,Masterful,"I saw Ricky Skaggs and the KT the other night in Naples. First class performance, not a single disappointment. Paul's version of Kentukcy Waltz - which was one of two solo pieces by members of the band - was outstanding. Later, I looked into his CD and was sold. This guy is good."
3,Not 14 count!,"This kit is for 28 count Evenweave fabric not 14 count as stated. I find it very challenging stitching on 28 count. I tried stitching on 14 count but became frustrated with all of the 1/2 stitches this pattern calls for, and have set it aside for now. I do like the design and the colors. The description really needs to be updated."
5,Overlooked gem,"This CD is worth owning just for ""Are You Sleeping?,"" a lanquid, sensuous duet featuring just Marty Winkler's vocal and a jazz guitar. But there are gems aplenty on the eclectic, mostly acoustic disc, including the elegant title track and ""What Would You Do (If I Said I Want You to Stay),"" a ballad full of longing and hope with just a twinge of country accent. Name a female vocalist you love --Bonnie, Joni, Linda, Bette, Norah -- and Winkler will sound right at home in a shuffle with her."
2,Worked while it lasted....,"After 10 months of weekly use and washing in dishwasher, the ""coating"" began to chip away from the center of the pan. Not sure if it was due to cutting the pizza while on the pan, but pieces shouldn't be flaking off after less than a year of use. Had to throw it away because I don't want these coating flakes coming off to end up in the pizza. Anyone else have this problem? Oh well..."
2,Big Holes,Baking pizza with this pan alone may not be what you want. You may need to use another flat sheet under it depending on your expertise.
2,"OK, not great","I bought these to catch more of the pizza dribbles in my oven, as well as for a crispy crust. The crust is crispier than if I cook pizza directly on the oven wrack, but it does not catch as much of the overflow as I would have liked."
5,Very pleased,The pan is better quality than similar products I have owned. Best way to bake frozen pizza if you want to avoid soggy crust.
4,Better than a pizza stone.,"I have been using a pizza stone for years, but never could get the dough crispy (especially in the middle of the pizza). I decided to give this a try and now I am ready to throw out the pizza stone. This makes a perfect crispy pizza crust. It is a bit hard to get the dough on the pan without smoshing it through the holes (unless you are a master dough thrower) - I used reynolds wrap sprayed with Pam to form it in the pan & then flipped it in. Worked perfectly. Well worth the $12."
5,Your last pizza pan,"This is a substantial piece of metal! It turns out excellent crusts for your favorite pizza recipes. Look no further, this will be the last pizza pan you will purchase. Five stars and two enthusiastic thumbs up!"
5,Cuisinart Pizza Pan,This is an excellent heavy duty pizza pan. It doesn't warp and delivers a crust as good as any Pizza Parlor.
5,I love it,This is a heavy pizza pan that doesn't stick. It doesn't seem to warp in the oven at 400 degrees. It's very easy to wash and for a well made pizza pan it's fairly lightweight.
4,crispy pizza,"I love round home made pizzas, this is not as big as I wanted, but I was having a hard time finding a good quality one that was bigger. The crust is nice and crispy and it washes well. Don't forget to dry it immediately, I had another one that rusted because it wasn't dried promptly."
4,Solid and easy to clean,"Great for our pizza. Wish it fit in our dishwasher. But, it's really easy to clean, so I just stick with hand washing."
3,So so Pizza Pan,"When you roll out the dough on the pan, it starts making holes because the pan itself has holes. Its recommended to roll out the dough onto your counter and then put it on the pan. I love cuisinart products but this one, I wish I had not purchased. The holes are too big and useless."
4,Good pizza pan,"This pan is great, easy to clean and makes crispy pizza. The only drawback is that you can not use a regular pizza cutter because the pan is non-stick so I use a plastic cutter which is not as good."
5,Great!,"Great product! Makes excellent pizza! I thought it was going to be a cheap item, but the pizza turned out to be the exact level of cripsyness/non-crispyness that I wanted! I won't be ordering papa johns again!"
5,Super sturdy well made.,"Super sturdy and well made the minute you see and touch it. This one won't be warping in the oven. Intend to use for reheats, breads etc."
4,Pizza pan,"This pizza pan is a good quality. However, hand washing is recommended. The instructions say ""DO NOT SOAK OR IMMERSE"". So if you want one you can throw in the dishwasher, this is not it. I don't mind handwashing if the pan is a good one. The only other thing I would change would be to get a slightly smaller version of this pan. This one is larger than my previous pan and I can't seem to fit 2 in my oven at a time."
1,Flawed Design,"I love Cuisinart products, and this pizza pan has a solid build, with a nice non-stick coating, as one might expect. Unfortunately, the holes are far too large. Stretching dough on the pan with your hands to fill out the surface area becomes extremely frustrating, because the pizza dough gets caught in the large holes and gets ""stuck."" It also is an unforgiving pan because once the dough is in place, it can sag into the holes, depending on its consistency. I went with an Airbake by Wearever aluminum pizza pan that had a larger diameter (15 3/4"") and smaller holes, and this supported the dough far better, and the pizzas I made came out great - crispy crust and no sogginess on the bottom."
5,The Best Pizza Pan EVER!!,I had a pizza pan with the larger holes for years and needed new ones. They are very hard to find until I came across the Cuisinart pans. They are the best pizza pans EVER! The pizza's just slide right off the pan and clean up is a breeze. I love the heavier weight of them. I make homemade pizza as well as frozen ones. These are simply the best and I highly recommend them.
5,Must Have If You Love Homade Pizza,"This pizza pan is so great!!!!!!!!!!!! I am buying a 2nd one. I buy our pizza dough from Sunflower market. Roll it out. Place on pan & heat in oven for 6 minutes at 425. The dough tends to rise, so be for warned:) Be sure you don't have a rack above the pizza when you put it in. Once you take it out of the oven it will flatten. Take it out spread a little olive oil on top. Put homemade pizza sauce on top then add pepperoni and fresh mushrooms. Bake at 425 for about 15 minutes or until light brown on top. This is so much better than any frozen pizza and only takes a few minutes to throw together.If you are looking for a pizza pan so you can make homemade pizza than this is definitely the one to get. Clean up is a snap. The dough does not fall through the holes. The holes make for a nice and crispy bottom. I highly recommend this terrific pan!!!!!!!You may want to buy two so you can have on baking while eating the other one:)"
3,Not What I Needed,I hope I am not being unfair here but this pan is built well and possibly performed great if you wanted a pan with large holes in it. I wanted something more like a solid pan and the illustrations were less than helpful and so what I have is a pan that get used more for a giant strainer than as a pizza pan but I don't like my pizza crust hard on the bottom and thats what this pan does. So quality is 4/5 stars but usefulness is 2/3 stars for me.
2,disappointing,"The first time I used it, it was great. I only used it a few times before a pizza burned on it- (the pizza was in the oven only a short time and on the right tempature)."
2,Not a miracle worker,This pan doesn't seem to cook crusts any better than any other pizza pan. The holes are rather a pain too between dough cooking into the holes (time intensive clean-up!)and crumbs covering your counter when you cut a crispy crust.
4,Like it....,"I just broke my very well seasoned pizza stone. Since they can be super expensive, when I saw the good reviews on this for the cost, I thought I'd try it. So far, it's very non-stick and crisped frozen pizza well. I would rather have smaller holes or none at all, but so far, so good."
3,It does what it needs to but makes a mess,"My husband wanted this for better airflow for the pizza. It cooks the pizza (well the oven does) just as well as a pizza pan without holes does. Down side is that it allows cheese, sause and topping to fall through the holes and make a mess."
5,Absolutely The best pizza pan!,"I have been making my own pizza for 40 years. I use my grandmothers' recipe. I never could get the crust crispy until I used this pizza pan. I've tried them all. This is by far the best one yet! ""Great Pan!"" Buy it.....you won't be disappointed."
5,Tasty Za,"I ordered this pan when it was <$10, what a deal! I have used it three times with fresh dough from the supermarket. I was sick of my dough sticking to my wooden peel if I did not make the pizza in lighting speed. With this pan I can take my time, I like it because I can strech the dough some in my hands then lay it down on the pan and stretch it the rest of the way out and the dough will stick to the pan and stay all spread out nicely but once it is cooked and crisp it slides right off. Nice weight to the pan too. The box it came in was huge, they need to find a flatter one."
4,Nice,These are great pizza pans. The pizza that was made in them was the best pizza ever. I am sure the cook had a bit to do with that as well. I would love to see them offered in a bigger size.
2,Vaseline - consumer product - no good in Amazon!,I paid a lot more than store price! Product is fine - but the price was way too much. Will never buy from Amazon!
5,Tried & tested,"No matter how much I wander, I always come back to good old vaseline. Honestly, if people are still buying it today then Vaseline should be doing something right. Love it, works for many many things from lip care, hair care, skin care , nail care, foot care. Also a good lubricant and a great make up remover, to mention a few."
1,Sent me the wrong product,This was a total ripoff. Not only did they send me the wrong product they charged me much more than what I would pay at a brick and mortar place. Skip the Candy store!
1,Disgusting Product...it's crap used drilling for your oil/gasoline,"Who actually uses this product??? Gross.Petroleum jelly is a byproduct of oil drilling, and when you spread it on your lips, you end up eating it, which is essentially the same as drinking gasoline. Add up the amount of lip-gloss the average woman uses (and consumes) over a decade, and it equals 7 pounds. The European Union has banned many petroleum jelly products, and experts are concerned they could be linked to cancer. Women with breast cancer have twice the levels of hydrocarbons (substances found in petroleum jelly) in their breasts than women who haven't had breast cancer. Steer clear of any products that list petroleum jelly or mineral oil on the ingredient list. ~~~Dr. Oz"
2,Stem is rather flimsy,"I know that these are intended to go on a specific vehicle but retrofitting to a custom built unit is difficult. Metal stem is weak. I accidentally snapped one off and had to rethread the end that goes into the rod end. It didn't take much to break it, rather surprising. Hopefully the shock will work for a long time after spending the time to get it mounted. Got it for a great price(not the regular Amazon price) so I can't complain much."
5,Entirely satisfied,"I bought this low-end notebook computer primarily to take on my summer vacation. I need to keep in touch with my business even during vacations.I especially wanted a Windows XP machine, not Vista. I use legacy programs that may not run on Vista, and I didn't want to have to deal with that issue.I could have purchased a refurbished unit directly from HP for a lower initial price. But HP shipping was very expensive, so with free shipping the total was actually lower for a new unit from Amazon.It was delivered promptly and works fine for what I need. I am quite pleased."
4,One of the last XP laptops,"I bought it from Amazon as I had this specific requirement to get WinXP laptop that's not very costly. Problem with Vista laptops that come with 512MB RAM is they are kinda slow and I would need to have 2GB RAM to be able to do everything I want to on Vista. Also you might have hard time to install MS Office older versions. I had MS Office bought 2yrs back that I wanted to use instead of purchasing a new Vista version.So this laptop serves my purpose of a home user who doesnt need Vista and lot of RAM. This laptop has looks but it weighs too much, you would probably need a desk and use it like a desktop instead.So far no other issues. Ah and free shipping is much faster than you would initially think."
1,Do Not Buy This DVD!,"This is the first and only DVDs I will buy from this company. This could be possibly the worst instructional videos that you could buy. I learned absolutely nothing, and the women were disgusting. Trust me do not buy this DVD if your life depends on it."
5,Hawke Does A Perfect Adaptation!,"With this book Hawke has done pretty much a perfect adaptation of Friday the 13th Part 6. It follows the movie and has some extra stuff in it that helps the story flow even better.It also delves deep into Jason's past with some great back-story and gives great into Jason's mind. Hawke tells a great horror story here. If you're a Friday the 13th fan, I HIGHLY recomend this book. This book could also make alot of non-Friday fans into fans. Hawke does a good job of telling the story of the best entry in the Friday series. Check this out!"
1,Garbage.,"Simon Hawke attempts to make a silk purse from a sow's ear, namely the script to Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part 6. Tommy Jarvis tries to fry Jason's remains, but only brings the serial killer back to life. Whoops. Hawke brings none of the movie's humor to the book, presenting everything in a melodramatic style so overblown it could be read as satire. Stictly for Jasonites or fans of bad books, if any are out there."
2,No menu,"I only watched this DVD once! The video is split up into three sections. One for first, second and third trimesters. You are only supposed to watch the section that is designed for your stage in pregnancy for obvious saftey reasons. Mine did not have a menu. I had to watch the entire thing if I wanted to watch the third section. Who has time for that? I also would not recommend it for anyone who is just begining exercise. It was a waste of $25!"
3,Pilates,It's OK but not what I expected. It divides the workout in trimester. Each workout lasts about 20 minutes. Short workout for me but cool when I don't have much time.
3,OK if your attention span is short.,"I like it, however, I was expecting an hour long workout. It was only about 30 min. It's great if you want some exercise, but don't have a lot of time. I'm a yoga insturctor so I was hoping for something a little more, but maybe I'm being too hard on it due to my experience."
3,Short and too Quick,"I found this Dvd to be not particularly helpful. It is divided into 3 separate trimester workouts, each of which is only about 10 minutes long. A 10 minute work out is not of much use to me. In addition, I thought the instructor went too quickly through each exercise, without much instruction on what to focus on. I enjoyed using a Pilates for Pregnancy book instead. I get a 30 minute work out using my book and I find it easier to read the instructions than to watch someone else zipping through the exercises."
3,"Good,but somewhat on the short side.","The 2nd trimester program runs only 14 1/2 mins, and I imagine the other 2 trimester workouts are similarly less than 20 minutes since the dvd as a whole only runs for 57 minutes, and that includes instructions.It's still not a bad program -- but less than 15 minutes is a bit dissatisfying."
2,Not challenging enough,"I know I'm pregnant and need to take it easy, but come on! This is too easy. I burn more calories and tone more muscle turning over in my sleep."
1,HORRIBLE!!,This was the worst excercise dvd I have ever seen. I would never watch it again. The instructer is creepy and could put you to sleep!
3,Not bad,"I'm in my second trimester. I practiced Pilates to relieve lower back pain before conceiving and was disappointed when I realized I couldn't continue beyond my first trimester since most of the exercises have you lying flat on your back. This video, however, shows modifications so that I can continue doing the exercises I love. True, it's not as intense as regular Pilates, but the point now is to maintain fitness and relieve aches and pains, not to make fitness gains. I find that I get a good workout if I do the second trimester sequence twice (20 minutes total) and really focus on the muscles I'm working. I had started to re-experience lower back pain when I had to stop regular Pilates but thanks to this video, it's starting to fade. I think this video would be best for women who've had some Pilates experience since the instructor doesn't talk much about technique, but beginners could still benefit."
2,Safe but not a real workout,"The video definitely shows safe techniques, but lacks any type of intensity. I was bored and did not feel that I had any type of workout. The stretches were nice and the tape is relaxing, but that is not why I bought it."
4,Good Video,"I find this video to be very good. It definitely shows you the proper exercises and form for your particular stage of pregnancy. The only thing that I dislike is that the segments are only 20 minutes long. I would like to have a longer workout, so I end up doing the same segment twice which can get kind of boring. It is a very good video though...."
4,Nokgorka,"The book in itself is amazing. Artwork incredible, the story is nice. The only downpoint is the poor quality of the book (materials). I had the same probleme with volume one. When you open the book, it almost breaks to pieces which is bad. But the story and the art are worth it."
1,Aerosol discolors rifle bluing,"As much as I like Hoppes No.9 solvent, putting it in an aerosol can is a very bad idea. I sprayed some on my rifle, and the cold No.9 coming out of the can immediately discolored the bluing on the receiver of my rifle. The kit doesn't say anything about not spraying directly onto blued parts.I'll stick to No.9 in other forms. This should be in a squirt, not aerosol."
5,Great Gift,Got as a present along with a pistol cleaning Bore snake. Was a huge hit . They loved how quick and easy it made cleaning the guns. Said now they would want to shot more.
4,Just what the Army ordered.,"I bought this for my son because he needed it for bootcamp. Not sure why they Army doesn't provide this equipment, but it was the perfect kit for his rifle cleaning. It works as well for the rifles we have at home."
5,Great little field cleaning kit,"This kit is perfect for a quick field/range cleaning. It is nice and packable, and does a good job at getting a lot of the grime out of the barrel without having to break down the gun.I have used this several times on my RRA LAR15 with great results each time. I have even started incorporating it into the cleaning when the firearm is dismantled. I will run this snake through with solvent before running a brush through, as I find it does a better job (and is easier) than running a patch through with solvent.All in all, for the price this is a great purchase and works well with a .223.5 stars."
5,Makes for an easier cleaning.,"I tear down my toys everytime I get back from the range. This kit makes it easier to clean my 10/22. It takes some tugging to get the snake through the barrel; but, that's why they supply you with a plastic 'tugger' tool."
4,Atomsplit-Microstar,"A high octance blend of punk and 80's pop-rock with an alternative spin, filled with plenty of geniune attitude and solid punch. Some of the highlights include ""Americanized,"" a sarcastic lambast against American pop-consumer culture (a theme that echoes in several places on the album). ""Saying Sorry Sucks"" is a wicked little piece of pop. ""Diggin' My Grave"" and ""Crashdown"" are a couple high-energy blasts reminiscent of the Foo Fighters or Green Day at their liveliest."
5,This was a surprise,"I got this Cd for free from the radio station i work at. I got it not thinking it would be anything good and then BOOM!! Im blown away. This was amazing!! This was just an awesome CD. IF you like Pop-punk, Alternative rock...or just plain rock this is for you. I think everyone should own this CD. It is so amazing. Now i want to get all of their other CD's two thumbs to Microstar!"
2,Kids lost interest,"I got this for my 4 & 7 year olds and they got bored after a few minutes and have never touched it again. The chairs are way too slippery for little hands to stack. They've never touched it since. I like it, but nobody will play it with me!"
4,Fun Game!,This game is like backwards Jenga with chairs. My kids love to play it but get bored after a few turns. I think the adults have more fun with it.
1,Very disappointed!,"My 21 month old loves to play the piano at his Aunt's house. I was so excited to find this piano. I loved the look and red color and was looking to get the matching drum set for Christmas the following year. When it arrived, I was ecstatic, only to be in tears once I opened the package. The only thing that didn't disappoint was the color.1. The keys were not level, some of them were lower and some higher.2. Awful sound! I didn't expect the sound of a real piano but this sounded more like a bunch of broken strings. I think I would prefer a keyboard instead.3. I received the wrong style. I ordered the Traditional Spinet and received the Elite.Amazon is working with me to receive a full refund. Thank you!I am just sad that it didn't work out."
2,MADE IN CHINA toy piano sounds very bad,"Buyer beware, Made in China. Manufacturer: D ~ Don't be fooled by the brand name, it's not German. We were so disappointed! Appearance: C ~ not a graceful shape and very clunky looking. The wood itself is so heavily shellacked I am not sure there is much wood there. Plus it will not stand up to much use by a toddler without highly visible scratches and dents in its shiny, shiny surface. The ""Mahogany"" style is actually stained dark flame red. Assembly: C ~ Holes for the bench assembly do not line up well. Piano is already assembled but is wobbly on the floor. There are no felt pads under it or the bench to protect your floors. Sound: C- ~ so disappointing. Sound is stunted like something is blocking the hammer(?). Not a lovely tinkling sound like our toy pianos from decades ago. This is a high end piece of crap."
5,Invest in your child's musical future,"Classy, tiny piano with great tone, given its price and size. New parents to whom I gave this gift were thrilled to have it for their first child."
4,Good Fun,"Santa brought this for my 2 1/2 yo son. He likes it and it sounds good, for a toy, but a little ""tinny"" sounding. The ""bench"" is not that great as my son can not sit on it by himself without it falling over. It is just not very sturdy for a small child. My son loves the piano though and plays it standing up or I help him sit. I love teh look of this piano, it sits in our living room and fits in great. It looks like real furniture instead of the ugly plastic pianos."
1,What a shame- what used to be a nice company has gone down the tubes,"This piano was such a disappointment! You know that Schoenhut used to make a decent product but now it's all outsourced to China and the thing is a complete piece of junk. It's a shame that whoever is running the company would allow this to happen. The piano looks nice but once it was out of the box, one of the keys stoop up about 1/4 inch higher than the rest and two of the black keys didn't even work. The sound is acceptable but the lower keys are completely out of tune making any combination chords dreadful. If the keys were made of a anything thinner and cheaper, my kids would poke a hole in it.Should I even talk about the bench? oh why not... unless you own a bench drill and are willing to re-drill the holes, you won't be able to get the legs on. The hole that the screw goes in is about 1/4 inch higher than where the nut is supposed to meet it. Got it today, sending it back in the morning. Don't waste your time with this."
5,Great book,my teacher read this book to my class in third grade and on the last day of school we did nothing but read! everyone loved Norman and micheal with their hillarious sock eating plant
3,"Good Information, Well Written","This book has recieved many 5 star reviews. I reserve that for the very best. I give this 3 stars instead of 4 because the authors do one annoying thing. They did an around the world cruise and made many mistakes as well all do. But they never come out and say. We blew it on this- we were lucky and figured it out later. Instead they write that this is the way to do it period. This may be a nit-picky gripe but I believe there are lots of right ways and I will learn more about learning from others mistakes, what they did wrong, why they did that, and why they won't do it again. Then from them just telling me this is the right way- accept it - we know. Not withstanding my sort of negative review this book is well written and informative. Would I buy it again? Yes- bearly."
3,Not for the first Book,"I was recommended this book for my wife for a woman's point of view to cruising, mine to which whom untill we purchased our boat had never set foot on a Sailboat. Having several years experience myself this book would be more suited to me then to her.Very in depth and informative. But not a first read if your trying to excite or more importantly ease the seemingly complex nature of sailing vessels or going to sea. This book will do the opposite and overwhelm the Newbie wife.Get something different first ...then come back for this one way latter once the hook for saling live is firmly set."
2,Does three years experience make you an expert?,"Inspite of good writing, excellent graphics and design, this is still a book written by an inexperienced sailor. To call it a handbook, is presumptious. Good information, but a lot of more experienced people have written far better. Worth the money? Probably, if you take it with a grain of salt."
3,Too much detail ?,"An overall very well written and informative book. The detail is overkill in places, I especially got a kick from the one page instruction on how to wash clothes in a bucket. People needing this detail should not be cruising.The contradictions arise when opinions in the book are contradicted by later actions eg. the praise of a ketch in many places in the book is tempered when one realises that their ketch was replaced by custom built cutter. As with all books of this type the opinions that they contain are a snapshot in time and do not represent definitive answers.Advice and information contained in the "" Handbook "" genre is merely that, there is no substitution for practical experiance, especially when washing clothes."
2,A rather harsh perspective,"I purchased this book by way of a recommendation from another sailing book, one of dozens I've read in the past few years. The author's negative bias and scare tactics effectively changed my direction from blue water sailing to building a small houseboat. I've read all Vigor, Pardey, and other perspectives on sailing and buying and maintaining sailboats but the dream ended with Beth Leonard's publication. Aside from her rather severe approach, removing the romance from sailing, her book is comprehensive. In my mind it is better to get this information from other authors."
4,Great book written from experience.,"I found this book to be very enlightening. A must read for those going offshore. The book covers everything you need to know : type of boat to buy, finances, heavy weather, crew considerations, provisioning, etc. I have been sailing for 10 years now and learned a great deal! This book would be a great first step for those planning to sail away from it all."
5,"An excellent book, still my cruising bible",I bought this book about 3 years ago as it was by far the most detailed and easily read book on the topic of blue water cruising. The book is filled with factual information as well as opinions based on the authors experiences. The first chapter covers the psychology profile of successful voyagers. This section is a must read for couples condsidering a live aboard lifesyle. The remainder of the book covers all the information required to live and travel safely on your sailboat. PS when you buy this book don't lend it to anyone it took me 6 months to get it back from a friend.
5,HER HAIR!!!,OMG HAS ANYONE NOTICED HER HAIR?IT IS STRAIT!i really like the new look!P.S if you really like my scene dolls go to there website www.myscene.com

4,"Madison's STRAIGHT HAIR, IS NOTworking!!!!!!!!","Why the heck did you crazy people change Madison's lovely curly hair, to plain straight hair. It was so nice when it was curly. I love the doll still, but change her hair back to curls!!! On some dolls, you SHOULD make her with curly hair, and on others, make it straight. That way, everybody will be happy.Signed,yon2nie7"
2,Not The Best Madison,I was really exited about these dolls and i wanted to get birthday club madison but then i saw her at the store and oh boy!Madisons hair was too flat and her blue make up wasn't pretty. I thought she would be really pretty. Oh Well.
3,Got to the 10 yard line and fumbled,"Almost everything about this collection is EXCELLENT. Spiral-bound for easy handling, great paper quality and great layout, not to mention there are 352 puzzles. But the one thing I find disturbing is that the puzzles are far too easy. I am not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but I am not the village idiot either. I've finished 10 of the puzzles, and have yet to be challenged. I thought that perhaps the further into the book you got, the more difficult the puzzles would be. Not so! All in all, a great publication, but when you fumble the ball on the ten yard line, you don't score!"
2,Super Crossword Collection,"I like the spiral binding, the size, but the puzzles are for beginners so not much of a challenge. I was disappointed that the cover didn't tell the degree of difficulty."
2,Too easy,"If I had known how easy these puzzles were, I wouldn't have bought the collection. However, having them in a spiral binding is great."
5,Excellent Book,"I read this book and thought it was awesome the whole time i was reading i couldn't put it down! it was suspensful and romantic all in one, so if you like thrillers or romances then read this book for sure!"
5,Just couldn't put the book down!,One of the best books I ever read! The plot was complicated and exciting. Everyone will love it.
1,An unintentionally funny first novel.,"The best thing about this book is that it is short. And funny, though I believe the author did not intend it so. Perhaps the most annoying aspect of the book is the fact that it wasn't checked for spelling or grammar. Did you know that in Seattle you can ride a fairy boat to Mercer Island? Wow. I did finish the book, but have to admit I resorted to skimming the last part. Mercifully, the 338 pages of text were printed double-spaced, which made it possible to finish in a few hours, which I believe is more than the plot, the characters, or the ""science"" was worth. Two thumbs very much down."
3,Good story but annoying to read,"The author shows potential talent for creating a story line, but he needs to find a good publisher and a good editor. The first half of the book in particular was riddled with misspellings, typos, and misuse of words. The book was double spaced with a ragged right margin as if it were written on a typewriter and transferred directly. In spite of this it was an interesting story, though character development was flawed with some inconsistencies. The ending was a surprise, but mostly because the rest of the book provided no clue to what was coming. I felt the ending turned what seemed to be real theatre into theatre of the absurd."
5,Superior writing from start to finish,This is a full-circle book! It starts out with an intriguing beginning that captures your interest and holds it until the end when you feel yourself smiling from the changes the main character went through. Mr. Thiele has done a fantastic job of creating characters that everyone can relate to. His writing style is refreshing and the book is well worth your time to read. I highly recommend purchasing this book as Mr. Thiele is a young author well on his way to a sucessful writing career. This book will definately become a souvenir.
3,"Get it for the illustrations, nothing more","This book would be best read with David Graff's ""Medieval Chinese Warfare"", which has much better coverage but not the colour plates. Peers' level of analysis on such issues as the Hun-Xiongnu connection and the historical authenticity of the Fei River Battle will not satisfy academic readers, while his cursory approach to the events of the long Han-Tang transition are sufficient only to pique the interest of the layman. His list for further reading is, however, poorly put together and the extensive bibliography in Graff's book is much more helpful. Nonetheless Osprey's colour plates never disappoint, and add much value that the text by itself lacks."
2,Weak on some topics,"The Men-at-arms Series covers ancient and classical China in five books, all by Chris Peers who is very familiar with the subject. This is the second book of this series. The chapters: Chronology -- The Western Han -- The Eastern Han -- Recruitment -- Organisation -- Weapons -- Defences -- Garrison Life -- The Three Kingdoms and the Ts'in -- The Barbarian Invasions -- Armies of the Invasion Period -- The art of war in the early Imperial Age -- Ten significant battles. The text focuses on telling Chinas military history; it is very weak on topics like weapons or battle tactics. The drawings by Michael Perry are ok. The maps are primitive and not very useful. This book is the sequel to ""Ancient Chinese Armies 1500 - 200BC"" (MAA218). The next book in the series is ""Imperial Chinese Armies 590 - 1260AD"" (MAA 295)."
2,"An OK product, but not for everyone","I bought this product in hopes of getting a small, compact keyboard that would increase my productivity on my iPAQ 3835. Although this keyboard although this keyboard is small and compact, the same is true for the keys. I found the keys to be an 1/8 of an inch smaller in width than the ones on my desktop keyboard, and for people with larger hands, and even average hands, you may find this keyboard to be cramped and small. Although Compaq had a great idea, I promptly returned this keyboard and exchanged it for a Targus folding keyboard.Pros:-Built in support for the iPAQ 3835-Made by Compaq, guaranteed to work w/ handheld-Compact & lightweightCons:-Small keys make it hard to type-Keys don't have that ""bounce"" that regular keyboards do; it feels like you have to push the keys in to get them to workSo this keyboard is probably OK for those with small hands, but for most people, you would probably be happier with the Targus for about the same price."
1,Keys too Small. Get the Targus,"I bought if for my wife, who has small hands. It was too small for her. Go with the Targus, it has full size keys. The Targus only has one gotcha: to use the Targus with newer IPaq's you need to use the enclosed adapter, which makes it hard to connect the Ipaq and which has to be carried separately. It took my wife a number of tries to get her Ipaq on the Targus keyboard."
4,Space Bar Correction,"Initially when I bought this product I had experienced the same space bar issue I read about later. I liked everything else about it. I was within warranty so I returned it for another, and this one works perfect. I like it much better than the infrared models and its extremely handy for meetings. HP gave me excellent service on this as well."
5,Kindle edition,"I am really excited that this book is now available in a Kindle edition. This makes it easy to take it along when you're shopping. Yes, I wrote the book and sometimes look at the reviews of all my books. I had to give it a rating in order to post, but I think it's a book everyone who sews or shops should own. Claire B.Shaeffer"
5,Claire Shaeffer's Fabric Guide,"I was hoping to order an earlier and shorter version of this, which I had borrowed from my library..but this book has everything you need to know to tackle any kind of fabric for machine sewing. In addition, there is a section which gives techniques and specific stitches which you won't find anywhere else.Highly recommended for the serious seamstress (or tailor)."
3,Not what I expected.,"This is the first review I've ever written for any of the many books I've purchased from Amazon - but this one was not at all what I expected. I thought I was purchasing a relatively easy-to-use reference - not a fabric encyclopedia. I've been sewing for over 25 years, and I feel that this book could have been greatly improved by a pre-review by users and a good editor. To make the information more accessible there should have been much less text, more bulleted information, each fabric section beginning on a new page and a spiral binding. This one will sit on the bookshelf more than it will be used. That's the negative. The positive is that it is a fabric encyclopedia, and everything you could ever want to know about any fabric on the market is there."
4,Very Nice but Too Much Redundancy,"My only wish is that this book were organized such that the same chucks of information won't be repeated several times here and there. This has more information than ""More Fabric Savvy"", but ""More Fabric Savvy"" looks better organized."
3,Good resource,"Some good fabric handling information in this book. Helpful info like what needles, stitch lengths, techniques, characteristics, etc. of all the fabrics you might want to use. I consider this book a good resource in my library."
5,Must have for your sewing reference library,"Packed with info to answer just about any question you might have for sewing different fabrics: fabric characteristics, which presser foot to use, needles,threads, machine settings, info on stabilizers and interfacings, plus sewing techniques and more. This book would be helpful not only for a beginner, but also for very experienced sewers."
2,"Not ""A lot like Robin Cook"" thriller, as advertised","I expected a medical technological thriller on the frontier of brain research and psychopathology. Spoiler Ahead - the research failed early on. No thrills there. It was a fakeout! The Doll House was nothing that exciting, multiplied many times over. I've read other novels using the subway tunnels under New York City before where the homeless live. It was basically a ""damsel in distress"" novel. On the positive side I must admit the very ending was unpredictable and I enjoyed it immensely. Like other reviewers have said, it was a fast and easy read and a somewhat interesting time-passer."
4,Evil has a name and it's Marlon,"Did you ever notice how stories, especially mystery stories are enhanced or even dependant on their setting? Victorian London for Holmes or the Navajo Reservation for Leaphorn and Chee? This story centers around all the underground tunnels and conduits of New York City. Unlike the detectives mentioned above, in this story, the bad guy has the intimate local knowlege. And boy is he bad!"
1,TOO SMALL!!,Yikes! This shoe runs too small! It is not true to size. Better get a whole size larger for this one.
5,Everything you need to stop forgetting,"If you've ever worried you were losing your memory, or perhaps your mind, this is the book for you. It talks about the kind of memory that's really important, which is not so much where you put your car keys as (for example) what keys are for, and the fact you can use a key to open a box as well as open a door. Some great tests of this kind of memory, which is key to creativity and to effective coping with the real world. A really fine and useful book for everybody."
4,For The Fans...,BGO records does it again...combining rare out of print cd's with an eye to the collector who appreciates the effort...who else would buy this CD except real fans of Steppenwolf?Early Steppenwolf is classic acid drenched blues rock recorded in SF before the wolf became big...great jams and the sound of heavy metal thunder on these traditional blues workouts and previews of some tracks that Steppenwolf would later record in studio.For Ladies Only is also for men but I am not the 1st to say that it is not their best effort but found a place for fans who had trouble tracking down the original CD release.
4,Early Steppenwolf/For Ladies Only Steppenwolf,"(Amazon Verified Purchase)This is a good buy if you are a Steppenwolf fan.The Early Steppenwolf Was recorded live at The Matrix in San Francisco May 14,1967.This was before They made it. There is a 21 min. psychedelic version of The Pusher on this cd.That was another reason I like this cd.Each album is on a separate cd for each album.For Ladies Only is one of their best later albums.If you purchase this cd, check-out the Jaguar in the booklet, this was the center fold on the original album."
1,Very disappointing,"I am very disappointed with this muffin pan. I've probably used it a dozen times and I have to dig and pry to get the muffins out. It's no better than the cheap one I bought when I got married 40 years ago. Furthermore, it's horrible to clean. If anything, I have to scrub harder than on my old one."
4,"Not as durable as it should be, but a very useable product","I have the same problem as a previous reviewer. The tab on the battery (secures the battery to the case) is flimsy and plastic. And yes the blasted thing broke off without any assistance from me after only 4 or 5 months of carrying it around.I don't have an issue with the cover, and I like the features that permit adding memory or pcmcia devices. It is a bit bulky, making the IPAQ PDA 2 and a half times as bulky. Which still leaves it smaller than a paperback book.A thoroughly average product, in some respects. Making a more secure battery and making the cover removeable would be big improvements."
1,topping with an apron,"I think they were more worried about getting sued than writing a book on topping. nothing really explained how to ""top"", just how to be safe when you ""top"". no techniques at all. just a bunch of ""be nice out there you big bad topper you..."" i did learn one thing, career ""bottoms"" shouldn't try to write books on topping. they obviously can't explain it very well."
3,Can you say *Domination-lite*?,"This is an ok book if you are a newbie or wish to gain some insight into the world of consensual sexual domination/submission. This book is written by women and reads that way.If you have had more than two sexual events which included bdsm tools/toys and your partner in some form of restraint, then this book will feel like time spent in summer school. You already know this stuff."
2,If this is the Dom Bible I'm an athestis,"Written by two Lesbians it seems to offer Topping from a Female view. Yes Virginia all Doms are not created equal. Yet in the real world the vast majority are MALES. It's cutsy, cutsy manor of writing get's old quick. It is NOT a how to book. Little attention is paid the the actual scene. Rather it concentrates on responsibilities of a Top and safety. I agree for the newbie these can NOT be overemphasized!! When one takes control of another the submissive/slave gives their all into your hands so, for me, Job one is to put YOUR wants/needs/desires on a low shelf and create an environment which will keep them coming back, and deepen the bond."
2,There are many other books that are better than this one,"I bought this book about a year and a half ago and have started and re-started reading it 4 or 5 times. Each time, I quit reading due to frustration. I was hoping to teach myself JavaScript, but could not do it with this book. It is not clearly written and it contains numerous errors. Finally, I bought another book and have learned more in 2 weeks than I have in almost 2 years with this book! The only saving grace of this book is the CD that comes with it. There are plenty of sample scripts and programs that can be copied into your own HTML code. However, I found that these also contain errors as well!"
1,A waste of paper.,I am very fluent in HTML and right now I am laerning DHTML and CGI with perl. This book contains no helpfull information. This book is great if you want to buy a collectionof other peoples JavaScripts. Anyone who can type can make a book this dull. This book wasn't even worth the mouse click to buy it. If anyone is thinking about buying this garbage DON'T! By the way the only reason it has one star is because it doesn't go any lower.
2,OK.,"Poor index. It's very hard to find things. The book tries to teach JavaScript by introducing Objects, Event Handlers, Functions, & Control Structures in a few brief table ref. style chapters. Then launches into several chapters of examples. I've tried the CD examples on IE3&4,NN3&4 and had trouble with almost every single one of them. Can't find anything in the book when I'm looking for references. No real advanced stuff here either. Save your Dough."
5,A Great Book on JavaScript,"This book will help you learn JavaScript the right way. I have spent hours with this book and now I have thought myself to because an excellent web master (if I say so myself). The CD is great, the secure site is nicely organized. I think everyone who wants to buy a book on JS, should buy this book."
1,pearl bracelect,product was bought for a pre-teen girl & decided not to give to her as it was so cheesey as well as the free gift that came with it. I got it on sale for $5.00 but had a retail price of like in the high 20's. looks like it would come out out of a candy machine. the saying you get what you paid for doesn't even apply here as $5.00 was way over priced.
3,Not as good as Lowe's,"I bought this to replace a light that didn't last 2 years, one of a pair. Got it in amazon's usual 2 days, but there were rough edges, some sort of schmutz I had to wipe off, and one of the attachment screws broke off, luckily I had spares from the old one. So it's installed, it works, and I probably would not buy another Progress lighting product."
4,excellent in-depth medical information,"Chapters: Species of Caged Birds, Avian Anatomy & Physiology, Physical Exam, Nutrition of Caged Birds, Chemotherapy for Caged Birds (drugs), Diseases of the Respiratory System, Problems of the Digestive System, Lameness in Caged Birds, Major Nutritional Deficiencies & Metabolic Problems -- Rickets, Goiter & Gout, Tumors and Egg-binding, Psittacosis, Pacheco's Disease, Newcastle Disease, Anesthesia of Caged Birds, First Aid for Birds, Saving and Cleaning Oiled Birds, Care & Feeding of Orphaned Birds, Postmorom Examination, Auto History Form, Checklist for Examination of the Cage, and Instructions to an Owner Taking His Bird Home from the Hospital."
3,Picture wrong,"I was able to use this item in my lamp. The item pictured (which is what I wanted) is not what arrived in my case. What came is a Coleman 21, green top with a tie. Be careful"
5,Nice Storage Cabinet,"This was an excellent buy on sale from Amazon. It was delivered promptly, in good condition, and was relatively easy to assemble for one person working alone. It seems sturdy, although I am aware that plastic becomes brittle in very cold weather, and will be very careful opening doors in winter."
4,"Cabinet is great, but cracked during shipping","Love the cabinet itself. Very spacious and the shelves are sturdy and easy to adjust to the desired height. It did arrive with a cracked door and several of the shelving brackets were broken off on the inside so I can only put shelves in certain places. However, I bought this for storing my weed eater, so I really only need 1 or 2 shelves in the top. So it worked out OK in the end. The crack in the door stinks, but it isn't worth me trying to send it back and hoping that its replacement doesn't break in transit. I may try to contact Suncast for a replacement door, but for now it's not a big enough deal for me to worry about it."
3,functional but a little cheap,"Product is a little on the cheap side. Pieces don't fit well. But, for half the price of a metal cabinet, it's okay."
4,Works Well for General Garage Storage,"I've purchased 6 of these to help organize my garage. They tookabout 15 minutes to put together after the first one. They have worked very well to clean-up the cluter. I've even left the shelves out on one to store all the tall tools and it's nice toget those enclosed. You can even store some med. sized light bins and awkward items, like coolers, on top which adds to the storage space. They look nice and the adjustable shelves areeasy to instal and move."
3,Great except for.....,"I like everything about the Tall Utility Storage Cabinet except for one thing .... putting on the doors ... Two weeks later and I'm still working on solving this problem ... the plastic hinge that is supposed to be ""pulled back"" into the pivot point can only be twisted and maneuvered into place when heated to 90 plus degrees..."
2,Good Idea but.........,Overall I like this utility storage cabinet. I should have heeded the warning of other reviewers as to breakage. This came with 2 breaks in 2 different places. Live and learn.
4,Exactly as advertised,This cabinet was exactly what was advertised and what i expected. It assembles in a few min. without the use of any tools. Once assembled it is easy for one person to move it into position. The doors have latches top and bottom to keep them closed (not sure the ad mentions that) and they even line up for smooth operation.Overall I'm very pleased with the Suncast cabinet and plan on ordering open or two more.I am happy to recommend this product to my friends.
2,Big Disappointment,"I had this dream that two wall shelves, two wall cabinets, two base cabinets, three storage trunks, and hundreds of dollars later, my garage would be in A-1 condition. First of all, the plastic in these units is not the same as other Suncast items I've owned--it is much flimsier. When it arrived, one of the tops for the base cabinets was broken. A place where the hinge was supposed to go in on the tall cabinet had not been cut out during manufacture and one of the front door handles on the tall cabinet was completely missing. The units do not compare favorably with other pieces I own in the taupe color; however, it would cost a fortune to ship them back so now I'm stuck."
2,Discolored Doors,"Tall Cabinet doors were discolored, splotchy yellowish. Suncast Customer Service has not responded to 2 requests."
4,This book is as good as any of them,"I've read several of these types of books and really think the best way to explore increasing sexual fulfillment (if you're going to do it thru books) is by reading a bunch of books about it and see what info works best for you as different books effect readers differently. I got more from another book but got some real good info from this one and really think there's many who will benefit a lot from this book, especially the swedish breast massage part..:) I'm grateful at least that this book is to the point and not long and drawn out like some of them."
5,Worth a good review,I'm still not sure why it's called Swedish Breast Massage but it sure feels good.
4,Great book!,"I found alot of good info in ""The Amante Papers"" Concise & to the point. Shared it with my boyfriend & we both enjoyed The Swedish Breast Massage, which I found very stimulating & erotic. I recommend this book to any couples looking to do something new or to add a new spark to their relationship."
1,Don't buy it.,"I bought this book as a joke gift for my roommate, hoping it would have some informative or just funny sex tips--I didn't even get that. It's a poorly constructed, typo filled, spiral bound rag that sounds like a high school sophomore wrote it. It starts off with detailed instructions on how to perform a 'Swedish Breast Massage' (the only semi-useful information in it) and falls off from there, wandering into haphazard mysogynistic generalizations on how to treat 'ladies' in bed (the words ""Young lady I want you to come _right now_."" were actually printed) and ends with a bizarre completely out of place 3 page collection of bathroom wall graffiti. Save your 7 bucks and get a six pack and a couple of friends together to discuss technique, I guarantee you you'll learn more."
1,Waste of money and a complete rip-off!!!!!!,It was a waste of money and time...basically massages and be in love..period.. I am disgusted and disappointed!!!! Very childish and brief...
5,thanks for some good information,"It's a good idea to have references such as this book has, including the drawing of where to put the vibrator for G-spot stimulation, and also the way to best stimulate the G-spot. The author's right that the area is sensitive and the precautions he suggests are a good idea if attempting to stimulate the G-spot. My husband was the first person to search for my G-spot and it changed my sex life. The section in the book on the G-spot is updated I assume because it's more detailed than what's in the excerpt."
1,you must be kidding,"I guess my american eskimno is deaf,pushing a button on this thing is wearing me out. He pays no attention, its has no effect on him at all. ended up going for a bark collar. Save your money,start mith something that does work."
4,great product for barking dogs,I have two dogs who bark all of the time. I tried this product and it really does work. It also has a great alarm system and a flashlight. I carry it with me at all times.
3,Partially Effective,"Every time I ride I get chased by dogs because I ride a recumbent trike. The Silent button with the ultrasonic sound is less effective than the other button that makes the continual irritating noise. The dogs do pause which gives me an opportunity to cycle away, but on a few occasions they have continued to pursue - especially the smaller dogs. Generally it works though. I wish they would make it smaller so attach more conveniently to the bike and also that it would stop the dogs dead in their tracks once the button is pushed. All in all it has actually been very helpful."
1,Don't Buy this item,JUNK!!! Will not work on dogs. Cost me $7.90 in shipping and handling to find out it did not work.
3,shorted,"I ordered three pounds and received 2 of them fine, the third was folded and only 2/3 lb. I bought 3 lbs and got less, I believe you should get what you pay for."
5,Works great!,"I use this for my shiitake mushroom growing, to seal the holes drilled in the logs. It does the trick!"
3,Fasteners too short Samsung LN46A650,"New Bad points:1. Needed 50 mm bolts for Samsung. 40 mm were provided. 40 mm is too short. (See item 4)2. At 0 degrees tilt, the LCD is off a full bubble from vertical. I had to shim mount so the screen was not pointing down.3. The picture shown is incorrect. The center hole in the bracket is much larger. I assume they are making $ on the scrap.4. The short screws are too short and the long screws are either too long without the stand-off, or too short. There should be 1.5 to 2 times the screw diameter of thread engagement. At best I have .25 screw diameter. I have to find longer screws or shorter standoffs. The standoffs are one inch long. They should be about 5/8"" long. I would rather had 5/8 and 3/8 included.The good points:The mount appears to be very sturdy and solid, but I won't know until I purchase the new fasteners."
2,"great workmanship, deceptive description","This was the second PDR mount I purchased from Amazon. This one, like the first was very well constructed. I've always had very good luck with my Amazon purchases but after almost a complete install (yes the mount was attached to the wall) I found Amazon's product description for this item was not only misleading, but inaccurate. Amazon states this mount is designed to fit a flat screen TV up to 42"". After cross referencing this mount against the manufacturers product line (on their website) I confirmed it was only designed to fit up to a 36"" TV. If you own a 42"" and are considering this mound, beware. PDR makes a very good product, but just know the PDR3442A did not fit my 42"" Panasonic plasma."
3,Not Same As Picture,"This item was missing a cross bar but my son-in-law installed it anyway and it is holding up my 50"" Samsung Plasma. Amazon was terrific when I complained and sent me a replacement which also came with no crossbars at all. However, I decided to keep it and used it in my bedroom to hold up my 40"" Sony Bravia. Seems to be holding up fine."
1,No good for my TV,"This mount does not work for a Samsung 26"" TV. One of the bars that mounts to the TV hangs down right in front of some of the jack holes.I returned it."
1,check out the size,Beware-this mount does not fit the 23inch Samsung television it was marketed with. I had to return the mount for a larger unit.
4,Made in America,"I had a few people ask me about this mount and each time when I told them the price, they shook their heads. I knew it cost more than foreign made mounts but I just couldn't do that. So I spent more and I'm happy with my purchase. It arrived quickly and mounting it was easy. Definitely a good investment. If you want to buy American, buy PDR."
5,LCD mounting bracket,"Got this wall mounting product for my 52"" LCD TV. Bought the TV before the wall mounting bracket. I patiently waited till i got the bracket delivered. Saw same type of product @ the electronics store for $200, got this @ Amazon for $100. Can't beat the price. This product is very sturdy & is holding my TV up on the wall very well. I asked my cousin, who is a handyman, to do the installation. The locking mechanism is a good addition to the product so the TV, for some reason, could not be lifted or removed from the wall mount easily. Been telling my friends about it. MCL"
5,PDR TV Mount,I have three of these in my home. I bought two for my son's home. They are great! Their quality speaks for itself.
2,It's normal,"This product is not the best one, it has a few problems, first the screws that comes with it, are good just for wood and not for wall, and once you have installed on the wall, you have to put your tv down so you can plug or unplug your cables from your tv... it's quite boring..."
5,PDR 37-60 Fixed wall mount,"This is a well made substantial mount.It is rated to 200 lbs. Most others top out at around 165 lbs.It is fairly simple to mount.Position and attach the back plate to the wall, making sure it is anchored in the studs and level. (Get a good stud finder.) Then you attach the bars to the back of the TV. All the hardware you will need is included. Finally with two people lift the TV and hang it on the wall. It can be mounted in two positions:one flat on the wall and the other angled down 5 degrees. I found the 5 degree tilt perfect for my VIZIO 55"" TV which is mounted with the bottom of the set at about eye level when I'm seated. They make a tilting version if you need a steeper tilt angle, but for most folks the ""fixed"" mount should be good. Overall this is a excellent product, I highly recommend it."
4,Pleased to have made this purchase !!`,"Im very pleased to have made this purchase . I almost bought the ""made in china "" model at Wal mart , but decided my 52 samsung deserved better . Installation was lengthy , because I did the project solo until the lift in place , I highly reccommend this product to any future buyers !! Made in the USA !!"
2,Ukrainian country side folklore and tales on the Russian bourgeoisie,"The book has 2 parts: the ukrainian folklore stories - witches, devils, ogres and what not - interacting with the peasants living in the Ukraine countryside. Nice story telling with a quaint sense of humor. The second part is from St. Petersburg detailing the Russian bourgeoisie life. Mildly funny.Some stories are a prelude to the surrealism to come out of Europe later - like Kafka. But make no mistake: Gogol is no Kafka.Only if you have nothing better to read at the moment or the above is something you have a special interest in."
2,"Alright but think I might have got the wrong cd, needed to get vol 3 but ordered wrong one","and already opened cd so figured i couldn't return or exchange, please correct me if i'm wrong and i'll revise my review, thank you"
3,"Nothing special, but enjoyable.","I think this DVD is pretty much a must-have for the type of Phantom Planet fan who likes to collect their stuff, which is initially why I bought it in the first place. With that being said, to be truthful, ""Live at the Troubadour"" is nothing extraordinary.They sound fantastic live, but it just wasn't as exciting watching it on DVD as it was seeing them in person. The DVD doesn't seem to really capture the energy that I know this amazing band is more than capable of showing. There also aren't many extra features to enjoy besides a picture gallery. Despite this, I enjoyed all of the songs they played and the picture quality is good. It's not the best, but I would recommend it for anyone who is a big fan of the band or a Phantom Planet collector.Songs included:1. The Happy Ending2. The Guest3. California4. Big Brat5. Turn Smile Shift Repeat6. The Meantime7. All Over Again"
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"The Guest is one of my favorite albums. It is excellent. This DVD is not. The band sounds awful, the singer is quite often out of tune, and the picture and sound quality is bad. Listen, I'm a huge fan of this band but this just is not worth $10. Pass on this and save your money for their next album!"
5,Genuine page-turner has all the right ingredients!,"This book has not just one--but three--strong heroines, a bizarre villain (actually more than one), and a plot that moves at a lightning pace. A reader can't ask for more.Ms. Kelman is an interesting writer who never repeats herself. Each of her books is unique. Be sure to read her other fine suspense novels, which include ""If I Should Die"", ""Someone's Watching"", and ""More Than You Know"".Good News: Her latest book, AFTER THE FALL, will be out in June 1999."
3,A book that offered promise that did not quite deliver,"This book was generally good. I say generally with emphasis, as although the story was OK and there was a little suspense, I felt the story got a little bogged down in the middle. I loved Wierd Ellie's dialogue in the beginning, which echoed of Hannibal Lecter, creepy, sarcastic and full of irony. But the great beginning didn't quite deliver, as the writing got littered with hard-boiled lingo with words such as like 'goddamed' and 'kiddo' that got a little irritating, as well as Quinn's tendency to just rage at everything and not think things through. I felt some of the characters just went with the flow and did not develop or grow in themselves. I didn't see the twist at the end, which was a good thing, but I was glad once I had finished the book."
2,Good mystery / thriller author hard to find,"This is the first novel from the author that I have read. The book started out very good, in fact is was good up until Quinn and Levitsky got caught following the psychopath from his house. It literally falls apart at that point. It seemed as though the author lost site of where she was going or just got tired of the task. A mystery should hold you until the very end and also clean up the loose ends left dangling."
5,Highly Recommended,"For a reader with a background in programming and/or computer science, this book is a great introduction to all major aspects of computer networking. The writing is easy to understand -- it seems the author is more interested in really communicating the ideas than in dazzling the reader with unnecessarily complicated language. The book is long on the underlying principles of networking, but also maintains a certain level of practicality that I really appreciated. I highly recommend this book."
5,masterpiece of teaching language,"I cannot remember to have read any book which is able to combine lively writing with a high level of theory in an abstract topic.the writing style makes builds up the overall picture more or less by itself in guiding your thoughts in a way that wants you to know more.The structure is perfectly modular, therefore it is also reference for the important ideas after you have gone through the book in the classroom as in my case.i can only congratulate the authors to this perfectly organized masterpiece in writing, i would appreciate having them as teachers."
2,Keys and unit could be larger,"While I should have been more cognizant of the scale of this product from the picture on this detail page, I had envisioned it as more of an ergonomic piece that I could wrap my fingers around and type with my thumbs. Unfortunately, it feels about 80% of the size I was hoping it would be. The keys are tactile, as they are raised, but they're just slightly too small for thumb typing at a better rate than hunting and pecking with the onscreen keyboard. The advantage of the mini keyboard is that, unlike the fullsize keyboards, you don't need a flat surface on which to type. However, the iPaq feels slightly unbalanced in the too-small unit and, rather than using the unit to support the iPaq, I find myself resting the iPaq on a desktop or on my lap. In summary, the typing speed gain isn't significant enough for me to recommend this unit to everyone given it's hefty price tag."
3,"it's okay, but the stylus might be faster","It seems like a neat idea, and it's nice and compact. however if you get into to a typing frenzy, your thumbs tend to cover up your vision of the keys you need to type, and you get lost easily and have to keep looking down at the keyboard to get your bearings. There's supposed to be a button to press in order to disengage it from the iPAQ so you don't break it. The first time I pressed it, it got permanently locked into the ""release"" position. It still stays on firmly and i can just tug at it to loosen it, but the button was worthless. typing might still be faster if you just use the stylus on the digital keyboard that pops up onscreen."
5,Awesome,A great way to escape and see what's out there in our universe.I recommend this for everyone to watch. It's a fantastic show!!!
4,Journey to the Edge of the Universe,"Journey to the Edge of the Universe was very good and entertaining, and i will recommend it to all my friends. I will buy the complete series. It was great."
1,Need more Caffeine,"As I watched this computer generated mess I came to the realization that National Geographic no longer digs into the strange and wonderful things that surround us. Now they just throw up a few fancy computer graphics and add in a lot of, ""could have, maybe, possibly & what if"" to try and make it interesting. I needed more caffeine to stay awake, it was just that boring! With all of the wonderful real photographs and footage out there I guess I expected to see some stuff that was real. I also expected a factual and educational tour, not this made up bunch of speculation."
1,"Not much scientific information provided, low quality visuals","Warning: The audio mix is pathetically off. The opening trailer and title screen volume is 10x louder than the main content.The main content narration is subpar when compared to the typical quantity of scientific information and insight provided in any of the BBC's Attenborough nature specials. The CGI is also unimpressive and the blu-ray is only 1080i and even that might be a stretch. I much prefered Stargaze HD on blu-ray, even though it lacked narration, for similar subject matter.This blu-ray is certainly not worth the asking price. Rent it from Netflix if you must see it."
5,a great ride,"Fascinating graphics, very beautiful, good narration but would've liked a little more info on some of the things on the journey,but that may be a whole different video."
2,"Great pictures, bad text","The disc is a collection of near-realistic computer graphics. The first half is solar system planets. The second half focuses on white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes, with insufficient attention given to nebulae, globular clusters, and elliptical galaxies (all galaxies shown are either dwarf irregular or grand-design spirals).The rather pleasant images are well rendered, but the text for the voice-over is worse than nothing. The discussion is juvenile, reaching for fake drama rather than context and information. The danger of getting close to the objects discussed is overdone, and the repeated theme of hesitancy to move on is tedious.The film over-uses a ""warp drive"" effect to patch together vignettes. That effect is poorly rendered (not scientific enough), and much too long. Showing a good map would have been far better way to show travel. The images are good, but will be better when the voice-over is completely re-written and replaced. Not yet ready for prime time."
3,Art not Science,"Good CG. Nice flow. Sloppy science. Give it five stars for the art, one star for the content. Definitely not useful in an educational environment unless the students and teacher are all easily amused..."
4,It tried to cover too much in too little time.,"I found the ""Journey to the Edge of the Universe"" very instructional and quite interesting. My only caveat is it tried to cover too much information in only a short time frame. It did peak my interest in learning more about our universe though and for that I give it a solid 5 stars. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning about the universe and it is well worth your money and time. Alec Baldwin has a nice voice and narrates it quite well."
2,Mehhh! Underwhelmed with this Blu Ray & Annoyed with Alec Baldwins Narration,"OK, so let me start by saying, I was expecting to love this bluray after reading the comments. Boy was I wrong, the tone of the narration is like they are talking to preschoolers. And his voice just doesn't sound right to me. I know this should be minor, but since the voice over is so important to a movie, I just couldn't watch it. The overall image quality is great, but I found it unteachable."
2,DVD,Disappointing! Felt like I was back in school watching a boring science movie. Would not recommend!
2,Not so great. Not so accurate.,"Most thought this was great but I thought they completely dropped the ball on many of the graphics. So much more could have been done to make the cgi more technically accurate. Many planetary surfaces, that we know in great detail, were totally generic without realistic looking scenes. They did the classic mistake of showing the asteroid belt as being heavily littered with flying rocks. True, there are hundreds of thousands but they don't swarm together like a constant meteor shower as the film implied. Also, the scene showing Voyager Leaving the solar system--where particles are even more widely dispersed--showed Voyager basically dodging flying debris constantly. I'm really surprised they left such inaccuracy when the true nature of the scene is clearly and commonly known. I expected much more from the venerable National Geo..."
3,Alec Baldwin can't hold a candle to Sean Pertwee,"When I first watched this, it was narrated by British actor Sean Pertwee. I was instantly mesmerized by and drawn in to his skillful narration. It was such a wild ride through the cosmos and I enjoyed every second of it. Sadly, I didn't know his name at the time. When I rushed in to buy the BD version, I was surprised by the different narrator.Visually, it still is a sight to behold with some of the most amazing CG I have seen in a documentary about space. However, the overall experience seems lacking. It is nowhere as good with Baldwin's flat narration. I also wish it was 1080P instead of 1080i seeing how this is a new program with fast moving action. The BD also seems to be region-free as no region is specified on the cover.Oh well, I guess I have to wait for the UK release."
1,"Disappointed in this product. Computer annimations are ok, but I expected more fundamental knowledge reporting.","If you only want a animated ""trip"" through space, then maybe you won't be disappointed like I was. I was expecting much more information to be conveyed than what Mr. Baldwin actually delivered.Instead, if you're like me and want to actually know what's happening out there and what the current theories of the day are all about, then I recommend The Universe series from the History Channel. Much better and much more thorough investigations.Hope that helps someone!jk"
3,Sure is pretty!,Excellent visuals and very compelling material. Writing can be overly dramatic/a bit cheesy. Alec Baldwin does a good job with what he's given to work with.
4,A brief comment,"This is a visually spectacular journey from our solar system to the outer reaches of intergalactic space and to the edge of our universe. Using state of the art computer animation along with photos from the Hubbell telescope (and also a fly-by spacecraft whose name I don't recall), the visuals are truly striking and enjoyable to watch. The narration done by Alex Baldwin is excellent, the only problem is the technical level of the script, which is about 8th grade level at best. If you're a fan of the BBC Planets series or Carl Sagan's Cosmos, there won't be anything new here from an educational or scientific standpoint, but if you have children this would be fine for the entire family to watch since it would be accessible to non-scientists or children. Five stars for the visuals and three stars for the script, four stars overall."
4,Journey to the Edge of the Universe - DVD - Good Buy!,"I really never had much of an opinion of Alec Baldwin one way or the other until watching Journey to the Edge of the Universe. I for one really enjoy his narration in this program. The program on DVD is very clean and crisp. The graphics, and images are excellent. Very quick breaks in DVD between ""scenes"" (where television commercials would be if watching it on National Geographic channel). The only thing I kind of missed, or that was different on the DVD version than watching it on the National Geographic channel was that some of the music that plays out as each ""scene"" ends (going into each commercial), was pretty much omitted from the DVD. On the television version, I had grown fond of that music and noticed its abscence from the DVD. Still a great DVD."
4,Loved it,"Thought this was pretty interesting. I dont believe it was ever meant for an educational setting but it is a very interesting, insightful (in plain english) dvd, with awesome narration. I got this and a morgan freeman universe type dvd just because of their narration abilities and they really do draw you in and put you in the movie. really really neat."
4,Priceless but pricey II,"Much like the first installment of singles, seeing these remixes and b-sides come out on CD in ANY form was a welcome sign.There are so many good tracks here like ""We Need You,"" ""Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)"" and several excellent live recordings that its hard to overpraise the music contained herein.The packaging however is tough. All single CDs... I am sure I am not the only one to quickly make a compilation CD of the rare tracks and put the nostaglia sleeves away for safe keeping.Wish they would have done that for me....."
5,SATISFIED WITH UPGRADE,I WAS VERY SURPRISED AND PLEASED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION TO MY ORDER OF MEMORY CARDS FOR MY PLAYSTATION2. I WAS EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW LOW PRICE....BUT MORE SO WHEN I GOT AN OUTSTANDING UPGRADE 16MM EXPANSION MEMORY CARD FOR THE SAME LOW PRICE. THE GAMES OUTLET KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEIR CUSTOMER FEEL IMPORTANT.THANK YOUR FOR HAVING THE GAMES OUTLET JOIN YOUR SITE.
5,U cant go wrong buying this,"This is the official and the only properly working ps2 memory card out there. The others may have more memory, but ull regret buying anything but this card because the files erase easily on any other memory card. Memory cards are overpriced though. Its 25 dollars, but after buying a ps2 with 5 games for 500 bucks, 25 isnt much. BUY IT"
4,good memory card,"nice memory card, wish it had more memory but thats cool because they make a 64mb memory card you can buy from best buy. reliable and has quick saves"
5,"A memory card with 8,000 kb (8 MB?)THAT'S A LOT OF INFO!!","Even thogh there's a 16,000kb (16 MB) I only trust products that are made by Sony. Some brands make things that screw up your console.nOW let's get to the memory card. Now I think that 8,000 kb is A LOT! Well duh it is! LOL :-).You'll be able to fit a lot of memory on this baby!The game i've seen with the most data has to use 107kb.So even if you play things that use 150 kb, NO PROBLEM! Pop this baby in and SAVE,SAVE,AND SAVE!:-)"
5,Genial,este producto es lo maximo exelente siempre guarda todos mis juegos de muy buena calidad y ademas tiene mas capacidad que la tarjeta anterior
3,Expensive for low storage!,"This memory card is a must if you intend to save games. It's very expensive for the low storage capability, but unfortunately there isn't any other alternatives right now. ... I already have it half full and only saved a few games data. 4 games to be exact. Dynasty warriors 2, Madden, SSX and NHL takes up 2 megabytes by itself. You will easily fill this card up in no time."
1,Not satisfied,This product doesn't let you save American made games it let me save one partnered with a foreign game maker but not any of my other games. I would not recommend this product.
4,as described,"Product works as described. Would have given it 5 stars, but I have since found similar item at a lower price."
5,Great!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you have a ps2, this product is an absolute must.I cant believe how much memory it can hold. I think it holds about a hundred blocks of memory. not bad huh?"
1,Horrible!,I would rate this a 0 but I cant so 1 is it. I have paid for this TWICE!!! And not one time I have I recieved it! I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS TO MY FRIENDS!
2,Building another Terminator,"Using the technology from this 8MB Memory Card (left over from the dead Terminator), you should be able to construct another Terminator robot and send it through time.If you create a bad Terminator robot, you should definitely soup it up like the A-Team van, with some crazy special powers that will help it destroy mankind. If you create a good Terminator robot, just make it like normal (and P.S. thanks for saving mankind)."
1,Memory Cards Suck,"I just got back from buying a brand new PS2 and memory card and excitedly started up a game of FFIX (for playstation 1). Imagine my surprise when I couldn't save my game. At all. While the machine recognized the memory card, the game refused to acknowledge its existence. SO now I'm out almost a hundred dollars for the game and the card and I HAVE NO WAY TO SAVE. Sure, the memory card works just fine for PS2 games. But try to use it with a Playstation 1 game and it's just a piece of crushed plastic wedged into a... machine. And who in there right mind would make us buy it *seperate* from the console? THe whole point is to save your game, and what's the point in playing a game if you can't ever progress? And whoever put a... price tag on this tiny piece of plastic deserves to be fired."
5,Work well,I bought two of these and they work well. I've had no problems with them. They are OEM memory cards and do a great job.
5,ps2 memory cards...,"ok first of all i think these are too expensive. if i was smart i would buy the 2 pack and save money but i keep forgetting. ive never had any problems with these. so... yeah, there ya go. buy these if you have a ps2 but buy the 2 pack and save some money."
2,Corruption,"I bought a memory card to play gran turismo 3 a spec. It was good at first. Then about a week later, it said that it had been corrupted, never to work again. What a waste of 30 dollars. You are better off with the cheap knock off because it is no worse than the real one."
5,Just what you need...,"This is the best memory card available. Although it is not the cheapest, it is the most reliable. I use this one without any problems. I have a friend who used the MadCatz one, and returned it, I guess he had some pleoblems. I do know that MadCatz had some problems with the memory card for the original Playstation: the stored files got erased occasionally. This memort card is you best bet."
5,great,"Great quality, great price, worth every penny.An essential IF you want to save your games, which you probably will."
4,Just a Memory Card,It is a must if you own a PS2 to save your games. I own two and have no problems with them. It is as it says at a new low price so it is a good time to buy one
1,How do these things STILL cost so much?,"How does Sony even justify that thes 8MB memory cards are still $20?!?! Thats the equivalent of storing 2 mp3 songs!!! Just look on this website for flash memory and you'll see that you can get a WHOLE GIGABYTE of data storage, even 2GB if you look. 8MB is still just one step above floppys. Talk about price control and screwwing the consumer! And you can't even use these things anywhere else. At least with the PS3 you can use other media (and over 8MB)."
1,What's to like?,"First, there is nothing about this to really write home about. It is a memory cart. You have to have it else your PS2 is worthless as a game machine. Most games won't even play unless you have one, so you have to have one.My main gripe is the memory size. 8MB? C'mon! WRC and GTA3 both take up almost 1/3 of the capacity of this cart for their save games. And it is going to get worse.Where are the 64MB carts?Save yourself some money and don't buy this single pack. There is a twin pack of cards for only a few dollars more."
1,"CORRUPT DATA - NO REFORMATTING, OR FIXING IN ANY WAY!!","I was happy when I saw that my Memory card arrived, and at first I had no problems. All I was thinking was the only drawback is that it had to save an animated icon on every file (Starwars Starfighter save: 133KB could take about: 100B to save if they didnt use icons 1024B=1KB).Suddenly after owning it for a week, while playing an ATV OFFROAD Fury game for some reason it corrupted my Oni Musha game (shows up corrupt) and is UNDELETEABLE it also has a ? for the size so I CAN NOT MAKE ANY NEW SAVES IN ANY GAME. I went online to look for utilitiesfor fixing it, and the only information on data repair / reformating was for the JAP playstation (they had a repair disc) I tried saving over it in OniMusha (didnt work) tried opening the card with all my games (in hope that they had a repair in one game) nothing.Setup: I do not have an irregular setup, NO MODIFICATIONS to the card or system, and Im NOT even using a multitap"
5,A great memory card.,"This is an excellent little memory card, it never fails me. The package wasn't sealed properly when it was mailed off because when it got to the post office they had to tape it shut due to it being open when they received it. But that's the sellers fault, nothing to do with the actual product itself."
3,should be obsolete,"As far as a memory card goes it is great (it has alot of space so it is worth the money), but the ps2 should have gone the same route as the xbox and had a build-in memory card with the option of buying one for additional space (I have both system and despite the +20 games I have on there it is still at +50,000 space) so it is worth the money, but should have been optional instead of mandatory"
4,Memory Card,"I haven't saved anything on it yet (my mistake for buying a boring game...) but when I formatted it,(if I understood this right)it said it would only work on my system. This, in my opinion, might lesson the chances of it getting stolen. I gave it four stars because it costs alot."
4,must have,you musst have it if you are going to take full advantage of your ps2it is expensive for such a small amount of memoryi have used cheaper ones where you have to inset a CD before accessing your data every time so that gets olddoes not work with ps3.. you would need an adaptor
3,PS2 memory card,Must have if you got a ps2. pricey for 8mb card if one considers the age of the technology.
5,good quality,Why go with the cheap after market brands when you can go with quality from Sony? Works very well with all my games. A little pricey but worth it.
5,Works,"This is the official Sony branded memory card, so it should work for your PS2. Though more MB would have been nice(and there are some third party memory cards that work with the PS2 with 2 or more times as many MB as this memory card) it gets the job done."
5,perfect,it was a perfect gift for my four year old son to use as his own inside of this dads so he couldnt erase this dads data
5,Great card,I think this card is awesome! It has plenty of storage and is super fast!...If you are gentle with the card when u put it in the console and dont just jam it in it wont break. And the cards are super fast the reason that they seem slow is the game itself. I would highly reccomend buying the card. The only thing that could make it better is if you could save ps1 games on there or after you save a game on the card you shouldnt need the game anymore and just play it off the card. But i guess thats illegal.
5,Memory card for Playstation 2,I am very pleased with this product and fast shipping. I would recommend this product if someone needs a memory card for their playstation game system. I enjoyed this product very much.
5,Worth the Money,"Watch out for uninformed consumers writing reviews! This memory card is an excellent buy. While it may LOOK like this card will only save 8 games, it actually saves 8MB! You can save much more on this card in a head-to-head comparison with the original PSX and its memory cards. Why on earth would Sony build the best game console to date, and then DECREASE the techonlogical capability of the accessories? Get real."
2,Review of my PS2 memory card,"The Sony Playstation 2 Memory Card (8MB) works great, it's a fine product.But what I did not appreceiate, was the $20.00 shipping and handeling charge that accompanied it, THAT was insane. It doesnt even weigh very much at all, yet to get it here was like a sock in the stomach. OUCH!! THANKS alot Amazon! GrrrrrrrrrSincerely, MY - LANTA!"
2,WHY SONY WHY!!,"Why can't this memory card be compatible with Playstation One, I mean just look at the price!"
1,this card blows phanny,"if i could pick a lower star i would pick 0 or negative numbers, this card broke my ps2. than i burned it and i didnt get my money back i ended up buying a new ps2......if you buy this card ur ps2 will break DONT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!"
3,There are cheaper ones.,"I went to the store and picked up a second one, which was much cheaper, by like 10 dollars. The official memory card is alright. I think this memory card can get flimsy though, as in worn. Sometimes when I put it in, it doesn't always read the memory card, so sometimes I feel like I am going to lose all my saves, but here it is, it is exactly like those other memory cards. I have a second memory card, it is yellow and has some black markings with a black circle. It was about 25 dollars, at the time, it was much cheaper than this memory card, and it still works exactly like this one. I would just go buy the cheapeast one you see."
5,Great Money Spent,I have 5 PS2 memory cards because my games take up a lot of space. I must say I'm not a computer wiz but I do know that the 8mb memory card is a wise purchase for those who wish to save their games.
4,Excellent item,"This is an excellent PS2 item. The only thing I would like is that it would have more space. Specially with Fifa 2012 that uses a lot of space to save championships.But overall it's really good, totaly recommend it!"
4,Good little card,The plastaytion 2 memory card is the best out there. the only down side is it is to expensive. Sony should have made it about $19.99
4,"Very expensive, but what you're paying for is peace of mind.","I haven't heard about the 3rd party memory cards, but from experience, those will inadvertantly erase your games. Yup, and I'm not kidding, either. Even though most of my cards are 3rd party, I own one of these for my ""super important save games..."" There's a huge chunk reserved for FFX, XI and XII...So, much like an insurance policy... get this and you won't ever have to worry."
5,Just pay the extra money!!,"The truth is that these memory cards do not have all that much space on them, so you will certainly want to buy two...I've made thousands of saves on these cards and only ever had ONE go corrupt so to say these cards work extremely well has to be an understatement. Plus, they come in a variety of different colors.There are many cheaper memory cards made by various manufacturers, but almost all of them seem to have issues of some variety, some have problems where data magically disappears, some has issues with saves failing, just avoid that hassle altogether. The cost/value ratio may seem poor at first but just surf around the web and find 2 for 29.99, you won't regret it in the long run!"
1,Memory Card Received Didn't Work,"Thoroughly disappointed. I bought a PS2 for my boyfriend, as I already have one for myself. When I put my memory card into his PS2, Kingdom Hearts 2 reads it, but when I insert this one in, the game does not read it. Won't be buying another memory card from Amazon again."
4,It gets the job done.,"The 8mb memory card gets the job done, but it is very necessary if you want to enjoy your PS2. If you are planning on buying many games, then you will need two. I'm on my second card already, so if you're a heavy gamer, plan on running out of memory.Some negatives, though, are the price and the packaging. So expensive! Amazon has a good price, though. I've seen more expensive. I guess Sony jacks up the price, since you need it if you want any enjoyment out of your games... any of them!And you wouldn't believe how hard the packaging is. You need a grown adult with flexable hands to get the card out. Be careful, because kids might cut themselves on the plastic, or might get migraines from trying to figure out how to get the memory card out of the package.However, the memory card gets the job done and is pretty reliable. I've had my first one for about 8 months and I haven't had any problems."
4,Never Had A Problem...,"These memory cards work excellently. I have two and the only problem is the high price. I am glad to see the price has started to come down. It is pretty bad for Sony to still be going the memory card route, but you have to get one and this is the best.I have had the mega memory cards and they are great at first. Then you start deleting information and moving stuff around and the mega memory packs just start falling apart. Just play it safe and get this bad boy."
3,PS 2 Memory Card 8 MB,"Delivery was late for Christmas, but as it turned out it was only needed if you wanted to save before the game was over and wanted to continue that game where you left off."
3,be aware,ill tell you it is a good memory card but over time it will erase everything if you action replay max and if you use it on the getaway game it will erase every thing so if you have it just to let you know that
4,An evocative and moving book,"This is a moving and sensitive portrait of the Bronte family. Apart from being rivetting, it's certainly worth reading for its emotional power and fascinating depiction of 19thC Yorkshire, social mores and above all, the Bronte family dynamics.The story is by turns comic and tragic, and through it all, Mr Hughes treats his subjects with compassion and understanding. I visited Haworth several years ago, and this book evoked for me the stark beauty of the moors and the damp, chilling Yorkshire winter. Brill stuff!"
4,A Trip Down Memory Lane!,"Egads! Where does the time go?? As a baby boomer, I experienced the 70's but didn't realize it was sooo long ago til looking at the photos in this book which are delightful and enjoyable. It's a very interesting decade that not only included Cher and Charlie's Angels but Kent State, the fall of Saigon and Three Mile Island. The writing is typical People magazine style; i.e. not in-depth coverage but does gives an overall view of the 70's."
5,JUST WHAT I WANTED,I purchased this book as a gift for a friend who is really wild about the 70s. Its great and has tons of photos. My copy was in near perfect condition. Very happy with my purchase.
3,It was alright,The dvd wasnt that good..I mean the songs I injoyed personaly. But when they played a couple of their old songs they just completely ruind them. They lost their make up and everything else all due to the lack of popularity with make up theses days. But the new songs they played they did a pretty good job.The back stage footage sucked ass completly.But personaly even tho I havent seen the first or second one I recoment you buy one of those cause I see the reviews are pretty good. But If you are into masks I would recomend the slipknot's Disasterpeices dvd cause I here its reallly good.
1,very disatisfied,"I purchased a book for $37.54 and when I recieved the invoice it said $15.38, plus they sent me the wrong edition. Very dissapointed, will not use this service again."
5,One of the better quality cookwares,"Bought one to make cakes with and it works nicely. Good quality, and good price (less than 10)"
2,cake don't come out cute,"Maybe if this were my 1st bundt pan i might like it. But since it's not I must say that i am disapponted. The only thing good about this pan is the weight. It's nice and heavy. I had my previous bundt pan for years and the non-stick surface was worn so it was time to replace it. The cakes do not release well from this pan and the indentations in the mold of the pan are not deep enough which makes the finished cake not as pretty as it could be or as it was with my older, lesser known brand, pan. You hardly see the indentations in the finihed cake at all. In other words, the cake don't come out cute (if you will!!) And I'm into cute cakes. Also this pan has two pieces which are melded and the imprint of that seam in the finished cake is ugly. I'm surprised this cake pan got such good reviews. I think most people just don't know better. I'll be buying a new pan very soon."
1,Not Good,"The pan is definitely non-stick but there is a seam where the tube part is attached to the rest of the pan. I cook low carb so there was a high butter content to my cake batter. While it was cooking, the seam between the tube and the pan leaked butter on to the bottom of my stove and smoked up my whole house. Of course the smoke caused my whole house to stink!"
2,leaking bundt pan,"The first time I baked a cake using this pan, it leaked at the seam. The cake mix seeped through a seam in the pan, dripped on the oven floor and then burned. I managed to save the cake but I'm really disappointed in this product and hope to get a refund. The pan continued to leak when I later filled it with water."
2,an OK bundt cake pan - cannot make a pretty cake,"This is an OK bundt cake pan. The reason is that the cake just doesn't come out pretty. As mentioned in another reivew, the grooves on the mold are just not deep enough to show it on your cake. It looks just like a very plain tube cake and not very exciting at all. I wouldn't recommend this and will continue my search for a perfect bundt pan."
1,Leaky Bundt Pan is Worthless,"I was so excited when this pan arrived, but that changed with the very first use. I followed the instructions for hand washing and drying the pan beforehand, but when I poured in the batter, it leaked everywhere! All over my tablecloth and floor - I was livid. Turns out there is a seam in the center connecting the two parts of this cheap pan. If it weren't such a pain to return things to amazon, I would have. As it is, I'm just going to eat the cost and go buy one that doesn't have a leaky seam."
4,Cuisinarat AMB-95F-CP,"Was not entirely happy with it, but have only used it once so will see how it works the next time I use it."
2,Unsatisfactory Cake Pan,"Purchased the pan for its non-stick properties.First time I baked a cake in the pan the cake was stuck everywhere on the ""non-stick"" surface.Reviewed the instructions again to make sure that I have not done anything wrong and discoverd confusing instructions. The cardboard that came with the pan and the small brochure had contradictory instructions. One says use spray oil while the other one says do not use spray oil.Thanks to Amozon's good policy, I easily returned the product."
3,"SKIPPING ""IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE"" THIS YEAR? TRY THIS","Skip ""It's A Wonderful Life"" this year. Dare to break that ubiquitous quasi-religious American ritual and consider the Classic Holiday Collection.Double Oscar winner for Story and Best Actor, 1938's Boys Town (and the 1941 sequel Men of Boys Town) will make you laugh and choke you up. Can't beat that for the holidays. Also in the set is the least famous of the various versions of A Christmas Carol (not the timeless 1951 British masterpiece with Alastair Sim). There's a featurette with Judy Garland singing ""Silent Night."" The third title is the comedy classic Christmas in Connecticut with a youthful Barbara Stanwyck.Not Rated. Genre: Holiday Comedy/Drama. 6 Hours, 15 Minutes. Starring: Reginald Owen, Gene Lockhart, Henry Hull, Mickey Rooney, Spencer Tracy, Barbara Stanwyck, Sydney Greenstreet. Directors: Edwin Martin, Norman Taurog, Peter Godfrey."
5,Wonderful Trip into the Past,These movies brought back childhood memories that I can share with my child. I was so happy to find an original version of these classics.
4,Classic Holiday Collection,"I loved watching Boy's Town and A Christmas Carol on TV when I was a kid and I wanted to share them with my children. My kids are ages 6, 8 & 10, they loved them too. These are true classics!"
2,Amazon wouldn't let me order this movie box set,"I ordered this Holiday box set along with another movie and Amazon wouldn't let me order this box set but i got my other movie.I really wanted this Christmas box set for my collection but i,ll go elsewhere to get it"
5,True Holiday Enchantment,"True to the holidays. This Charles Dickens movie will warm the young and the ""young at heart""."
4,Holiday Collection,"I actually ordered this item because I wanted ""Christmas in Connecticut"" but had never seen the other two films. I was very pleasantly surprised with both shows and am super pleased with the entire collection. I received the shipment promptly and in plenty of time for Christmas. Thank you!"
5,Great Buy!,same item as described. I found it was cheaper to buy this set of 3 then the 1 particular movie i was looking for :)
4,Warner Brothers Classic Holiday Collection,I received this item very quickly and the price was unbelievable - 3 classic Christmas movies for the price of 1.
1,HOW CAN YOU SAY IT'S GREAT?,"I tried out every dvd in the collection and there's no sound. No, it's not my DVD player. It has music, just no talking. It skips over the option to play in English. This is the second time this has happend. The other movie was ""The Bad Seed"" The Sixth sense works fine though and the movie I got for my daughter ""Bridges"" is fine."
2,Misnomer,"This may be entitled ""Warner Bros. Classic Holiday Collection,"" but Warner Bros. had nothing to do with the production or distribution of Boys Town, Men of Boys Town, or the 1938 Christmas Carol. Louis B. Mayer may return to haunt the Christmases of those heretics against the one, true religion of MGM, who purloined Spencer Tracey, Mickey Rooney, and Ann Rutherford to enrich the reputations of Harry, Jack, Abe, and Ted."
3,"Descent, not as good as last CD, love peace and happiness","I felt that this CD was listenable, but the beats do not even come close to their last CD, Love Peace and Happiness. It's a good CD though, not great."
4,Still Got It,"I was very pleased to purchase the new LB cd. I have all of the other cds. Like the last reviewer said they changed there style a little bit it got a little harder. You always know it is the lost boyz but at times during certain songs you get the good old feeling you get when u listen to legal drug money or love peace and hapiness. It is still a very good cd i recommend. lets roll dice, We Got That Hot S..., Ghetto Jiggy, Plug Me In, and there are many other good songs. it seems though all the songs that have mostly freaky tah and mr cheeks are the best songs. I love this group but if freaky was still here. R.I.P. They should do a cd on there own cause i like alot more of the songs with cheeks and tah rather then lou and nice. Thats just my opinion."
2,Will Lost Boyz Ever Be the Same?,"You don't listen to the Lost Boyz for their lyrical content, but strictly their party beats. The only party song I could find was Plug Into Me. Mr. Cheeks seemed to mellow out on his rhymes. Not his uptempo self. Hope it wasn't due to the death of Freaky TAH."
3,"solid on the basics, if unexciting","This is the book I started Italian with - it covers the basics very well, and like most treatments of the basics, is work and not pleasure to get through. I don't know if it is possible to make such a thing fun, but this wasn't much. Nonethelss, it was very useful and I read it several times and took detailed notes and it got my on the way. You can use this alone, without a class if you wish.Recommended."
5,Just what we needed in the Trunk!,The kit is everything in one spot and easy to store in the trunk. Great buy and very handy. I would reccomend to anyone
5,Just what we needed.,"These inexpensive kits have just what we needed to put in our client transport vehicles. As a matter of fact, after we bought 3 of them for our business, 2 of our employees asked me to order one for each of them for their personal vehicles. I recommend them for safety reasons."
4,As described!,Very pleased with this purchase! Has all the essentials. Came as described in the other reviews. Not cheapy tools either. Obviously not first grade but does it's job as it should - and comes in a nice duffel bag that can be tossed into the trunk easily. Could almost be a gym bag!
4,Christmas gift for my son.,It was a christmas gift for my son. He liked it. He really really liked it!! It is a great gift for anyone with their first car.
2,"If you want to be prepared, buy something else","I just bought a new car, and wanted to make sure there were adequate tools in case of an emergency, so I purchased this. My first clue that this was not what I was looking for came when I open the bag and the zipper broke. It does have what seems like a good mix, but, as I thought about I would have wanted available I would have preferred some sort of socket set be included as well. The contents are very cheaply made and I don't have a lot of confidence in them. I'm hoping I do not have to use this kit, and plan on replacing it with something I make myself. I would not buy it again."
4,Circle Time Book,"A GREAT BOOK for a first time teacher! This thematic book has a wealth of information, arranged by significant school events and holidays, based on parts of a well developed school day. A good reminder what to include and what not to forget in developing and implementing a preschooler's day. And the little tips and time fillers are great for establishing and maintaining a personal catelogue ""on the go"", just like the preschoolers we serve. A must for your library."
4,Improvements.,"Well, I picked up this CD player and tried it out once again. Amazingly, the quality was superb. The bass and everything was perfect. I especially love the volume control. It's a dial, so you can adjust it to exactly what you want. I have two complaints though. First of all, the CD player makes this weird static noise between each song. It's not the CD, because I've experimented this on other players. Second, the latch to open up the player is located in a place usually gripped or rubbed against. Which usually results to the interruption of music.Overall: A good product. But if the two problems mentioned above annoys you, then I suggest getting another player.Hope this helped!"
2,Hate it!,I hate this Camera. It's never worked quite right since day one. It's impossible to get a good shot because it's so slow.You can not use the zoom feature. The pictures come out soo blurry. Cropping is a joke. The screen locks up when scrolling through pictures. I have a $15 fuji that takes better shots than this one. If this was a $20 camera I would probably rate it higher. No way is it worth more than that.
2,TERRIBLE!,"This camera is terrible. The flash is slow, the battery dies very quickly. And the picture quality when printing them out is horrible. They are always blotchy. When I called about this problem they said that you have to change the camera to 3 MP mode in order to get decent pictures. But that still didnt work. I would not reccommend this camera."
1,iam sorry i ever bought this camera,dont buy this camera the main problem real simply said it the battery life sucks and it is also a hard item to find(battery) good luck i dont even use mine any more just for that reason.and yes i can buy a rechargeable but iam not in the market to spend $70 for it.
5,Great Camera,I also bought this camera at a local department store except on clearance...for 34.00 I thought it must be a flop..no it is excellent and by the time i got the rechargable batteries at the clearance price of the camera i am still well under 80.00 for the camera and batteries.
2,Riot at Xaviers's passable,"Riot at Xaviers is a trade collecting New X-Men #134-138. I had heard great things about Grant Morrison's run on the title but this trade left me very unsatisfied. The story follows one of the Institutes most powerful students gathering up a gang of students rebelling against the system. I was very unsatisfied with the storytelling, if i needed to sum up my thoughts in two words they are: Boring, irrelevant. Frank Quietly's artwork is horrible in my opinion and this is the first time i have purchased a trade and wanted to send it back."
1,Awful . . . keep Morrison away from Marvel,"Since when have comics become a medium for projecting current topical events (drug use, puberty-induced angst, teen pregnancy)? Morrison is a gifted writer, but its obvious that the guy is trying to kill the title.Things are complicated enough in the X-Men titles (New X-Men, Uncanny X-Men, Ultimate X-Men, Exiles, etc.), but this takes it to a new level. Who are these people? What do they bring to the table in terms of advancing the storyline? Why is Xavier just sitting around and letting his students kill people?And what's with the art? I can forgive on the condition that this is the same guy who penciled the original Aeon Flux, but thats about it."
4,Cool Like Linval,"Linval Thompson has one of the coolest voices in Reggae. His high yet smooth voice emanates on countless albums, however, this 1975 release features Thompson creating classic music. The signatured ""Long Long Dreadlocks"" is an anthem that is highly revered still today. Though Thompson is not the most prolific writer in terms of content, he manages to keep his lyrics so simple that that is probably the genius about his music. Titles like ""Jah Jah Conqueror"", ""Big Big Girl"", ""Don't Trouble Trouble"" should give you a hint as to what I mean. However simple, you can enjoy the magnetic riddims and Thompsons voice drifting over them. Cool Down is a Bunny Lee production and w/ most of Lee's work you'll find the deep roots style that he delivers."
3,Good but enough of the Science Fiction references,"The book started off alright but quickly became dragged down. There was not enough of Louie and too many Buffy references. This is a mystery/comedy novel. To many plot lines that need to be connected and finished. Unfortunately if you are a big fan, which I am, you will need to read this book to catch up on the many different trains of thought Temple/Max/Matt/Molina/Louie have before reading ""...Leopard Spot""."
3,I Almost Didn't Finish this One!,"I have read all the books in this series, and found myself wishing that ONE of the loose ends would please be tied up in this one....but nope, just a new loose end and more cat babbling. I enjoy books with animals....talking and otherwise, but this cat ""talks"" too much! I heartily enjoyed the first books in this series, but the neverending Max/Matt campaign is wearing thin. The fun part of the book is the science fiction convention, but it is not enough to engage a casual reader. My stubborness to finish the book was really the only reason I did finish it! Maybe the next one will wrap up some plot lines.... we can only hope!"
5,Quality Author & book,"Bought for Fiancee & she loves it ! Would recommend any cat enthusiast to read these books, as very funny and insightul."
3,I love ya Louie,"I love Louie, but this book was something of a disappointment. Mrs. Douglas kept us on the outside the whole time so it was hard to really get into the book. I have to admit though I was rolling on the ground at her depiction of a preteen girl. No preteen girl I have ever known is scared of a simple amusement ride and would hold her escort's hand. Mrs. Douglas hit so wide of the mark that she not only missed the barn she ended up 2 states over. Otherwise, an enjoyable if not particularly engrossing read."
2,Disappointed with picture quality,"I'm generally very happy with Panasonic products, but I am very disappointed with this TV. The reds are too ""hot"" and the picture appears ""grainy"" on some channels (Time Warner is my cable provider). When the color is manually adjusted, it varies from one channel to the next. Maybe I'm expecting too much, but I purchased a 27"" NEC TV over 10 years ago with similar features (incl. S-Video input), and the picture and color on it are superb and consistent from one channel to another. One nice feature with this Panasonic is the AI sound feature which normalizes the volume between channels so one channel isn't real loud and another too soft."
2,Value for money?,I am not sure this book warrants its cost. I consists largely of opinion and 'try this' recommendations written in a folksy style. Good points: it was easy to read with a big font and generous leading between lines.
2,Doesn't always work,When it works it is great but sometimes despite resetting it I can't get it to work. It says things are done in 2 minutes--impossible.
2,Piece of Junk,Got this free from a rewards program with my bank and from the start it was horrible. Very unreliable. You turn in on and it would never link up with the remote sensor. I would have to restart each device by pushing the tiny reset buttons on each piece of equipment. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this thing.
1,A piece of junk embarassed that I bought as a gift,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother in law. The probe worked for 2 weeks then it does not work - it reads 20 degrees too hot despite all the trouble shooting tips tried and attempts to contact the customer support. Unfortunately, this was a gift for a person out of state and by the time I find out -early Feb -I have missed the deadline to return this item so I am out money and my brother in law has no Christmas gift. Don't bother wasting your money.. to many unhappy people."
1,Unacceptable,"Didn't work on first try. No signal from transmitter to base unit.Read one star reviews here. Learned two things.Reset both units at the same time. Signal received.Turn units off when not using to save batteries.disgusting.I would gladly pay more for a unit that was properly designed, built and documented.Oregon Scientific deserves to go out of business for selling garbage to the public."
1,DOA,"Received the product from Amazon in only 3 days from date of the order. Great! And that was with free shipping.The unit did not work. Tried everything twice, used reset buttons several times, different batteries etc. Went Oregon Scientific Web Site, etc.Sent two E-mails to Oregon Scientic, rec'd return E-Mails I would hear from someone within three days. Nothing.Well made, good price, only problem is that it doesn't work. Now I wait for help and/or return instructions. Not Happy."
1,Big Disappointment,"It worked great...ONCE! After the first time using it I thought it was the coolest gift I had received. Unfortunately it never worked again. I tried many times to replace the batteries, hit the reset buttons, and any combination of the two. I REALLY wanted it to work again, but alas it did not...The base station would not read the transmitter it would indicate good signal but the temp always read 32 deg. Save your money and buy a $20 wired digital thermometer."
3,Still figuring it out...,"Well, I've used this thermometer twice now. At first I couldn't get the pieces to communicate but finally solved that problem. Really I don't feel the directions were very clear. I was roasting a pork tenderloin last weekend. The thermometer told me it was done, but when I took it out of the oven it wasn't. It may be because the piece of meat was not very big and the probe wasn't inserted far enough or too much of the probe was not in the meat. Anyway, I'll keep trying. I purchased on of these for my son a few years back and he has been very pleased with his. I'll update once I've used it a few more times."
4,Under loaded info,The first unit I ordered came with instructions on how to operate and use the AW131 wireless talking oven/barbecue thermometer. I couldn't get it to work. The unit would not connect to the hand set. I called Amazon thinking it was defective. They sent me another one that I had the same trouble with. I called Oregon Scientific and ask them what I was doing wrong. I was following the instructions to the letter. They finally e-mailed me back with better instructions on how to get it to work. Following their new instructions it worked perfectly. They need to rewrite the instructions that come with the unit.
1,Worked Great........Once,"Took it out of the box and it worked great the first time, with the exception of getting the transmitter and receiver synced up. Attempted to use it a few days later and after I got it set up and turned it on it claimed the meat was at 150F (which wasn't possible as it had just come out of the fridge). With in a few minutes the temp had skyrocketed to over 250F. I reset the transmitter and receiver several times and changed the battery in both with no success. I later switched out the probe with another that I had, and the unit worked fine. Unfortunately by the time I had used it was outside the eligible return date, and Im now stuck waiting on a response from Oregon Scientific. No matter what the product is, if it breaks after one use only gets one star in my opinion."
1,Didn't work first time out,"Bought this item in the dead of winter so didn't use it for several months. When I finally got around to using this remote thermometer, it wouldn't work - replaced batteries, turned both units on and off, unplugged sensor - no signal. It's beyond the return period now.Made in China."
1,might as well throw $30 in the trash,This thing has a range of about 5 feet when you can actually get it to work. I am in the process of smoking pork shoulders right now and it would have been the 4th time using this thermometer if I could get it to work. Horrible go get a maverick and stay away from OS.
1,Disappointment,"I was so excited to use this with my smoker and weber BBQ. I could not get the base to sync there was no reset button in the base. I retuned it and got a new unit that did have the reset button but would not sync after two days of trying. I sent ot back too, and got a refund. Don't waste your money."
1,Disappointed: Oregon Scientific AW131 Talking Barbecue Thermometer,"Every time I try to use this item, even when first purchased, I've replace batteries in both receiver and transmitter, reset the transmitter and it has never worked."
1,GGrrrr,product worked great for 4 weeks then acted like i was asking for the temp on mars. i would have returned it but with the holidays i just forgot. my recommendation is don't buy it
1,product came with a defective probe,I have contacted oregon scientific about the problem and they said they would send me a new probe.But the SELLER should never have let this product out for resale.
1,Please don't buy,I purchased mine 5 months ago worked great until January 2011. Purchased 2 additional units for my boys at Xmas. Both did not work at all. When it finally communicates it goes to 199 degrees. All three units do this. Mine is in the trash and have told my boys to do the same. Will not buy from this company ever again very poor quality control. I am surprised they are still in business the CEO needs to get a handle on their product line.
1,It doesn't work,The item arrived as promised but it doesn't work. Have been trying to contact seller via Amazon with no success. Does Amazon have a return policy? Please advice.
1,Too bad there is not a ZERO,"Bought on good faith but circumstances caused me to not use it for the first time until after the return period passed. It never worked. Not once. Not for a second. The base unit would never connect with the transmitter. No matter what I did, nothing. I would have been better off burning the money. At least I would have gotten a little heat out of my money."
1,Broke After Two Uses,"I had the same experience a number of other reviewer's had. The unit quit working after the second the use. The thermometer registers 214 degrees all of the time. We have replaced batteries, reset, re-synced... all to no avail. Do not purchase this item, it will just end up in the trash."
1,"junk, junk, junk!","what a piece of junk!It worked ONCE.Then, the next time I went to use it (about 5 days later) the batteries are all dead.I replace the batteries, it's not getting the temp.I see a note about turning on the remote piece first. Ok, I do that, now we're getting the temp.About 15 minutes later, it's detecting a temp well over 250 degrees and going nuts.I reset everything, it seems good at first, then goes nuts again.I'm done with this piece of junk. Sending it back."
1,"Broke Within First Year of Use, No Replacement",I first gave this a positive review but it's useless when it will no longer connect with the temperature probe sensor.
1,Do not buy,"I ordered two of these for family members on Christmas. Both of them did not work and I am very upset. I trouble shooted the problem at my dads on christmas and called my uncle to make sure his worked. Now I have to have both family members send them to my house to have them replaced, and then send them back to their respective houses. A big hassle and letdown if you ask me."
2,Wireless rarely works right.,"I bought this to use in the kitchen and on the grill because sometimes the fork-style thermometer is not the right choice. However it seems like no matter when or how often I use this thermometer, there's a better than 50% chance the wireless link between these two devices WON'T synchronize. Replacing the batteries with new doesn't help either. Without the wireless link all you have is a paper weight. I should have returned it to Amazon the first time it failed to sync."
1,good item,Worked well but did not have the temperature range needed for distilling-- i returned it with no trouble from Amazon
2,"Display difficult to read, wouldn't sync up","Bought this thermometer for my Dad as a Christmas gift. The display is difficult to read unless you hold it at an angle (there is no contrast adjustment for the LCD). Upon initial power up, it took a VERY long time and several attempts for the display unit to ""sync up"" with the thermometer unit. We finally got it working, but I was very disappointed in how much effort it took. Aside from these shortcomings, this thermometer works ""as advertised""."
4,Great gift for that hard to buy for person.,We gave this talking meat thermometer to my father-in-law for Christmas. He was thrilled that it can be used in his outdoor grill and in his oven inside. I will give this as a gift again in the future.
1,OK but it didn't last,"Purchased this for my father for Christmas since he burns everything. Well, it took forever to setup, and when it worked, it worked great! Talking to my father last weekend I asked how it was holding up and he stated that while grilling chicken, it beeped at him, displayed that the temp was 3000 degrees and then just stopped working. Nothing he did could bring it back to life."
5,Great so far!,"I purchased this because I had bought a propane smoker. As I was reading about using my new smoker it talked about the advantages of a remote thermometer so that one was not continually opening the door and losing heat. I researched a little and found the best price for the Oregon Scientific model on Amazon. I used it for a roast (worked perfectly) and last night cooked a whole salmon on the grille. It again worked perfectly and impressed our whole family, as the salmon was cooked perfectly. If It continues to work as well in the future, then I am happy with the purchase. (I take out the batteries of both units and store in a zip lock bag between uses."
3,Review of wireless grill thermometer,It worked fine once we got it working. Even after following the instructions and starting over once or twice there was some difficulty getting the receiver and thermometer to recognize each other with the wireless signal. It did take some effort but we got it working and now love it!!
1,rocket science?,"I had to return this item after finding poorly written instructions and the device being unintuitive to operate. Way too many steps and settings, plus there can be problems with the meat probe sensor communicating with the receiving unit. Sounds good on paper, but trying to use this thing is more trouble than it's worth."
1,worked great for about 3 hours,worked for 3 hours than quit transmitting a rill bummer when your trying to do a 8 hr cook and dont know where your smoker is pulled out my 10 dollar walmart special and got the job done
1,Mistake! Twice,"A talking wireless thermomter? How cool is that? The problem is that it only worked once. Tried everything (batteries, reset, ouiiji board, you name it. Nothing. So I returned it and got a replacement. Same story, worked once then boat anchor. Don't waste your money."
2,Reset Buttons Essential,Thanks to the other reviewers who said that both reset buttons had to be pushed. Had it not been for them I would have thrown the thing against the closest wall out of frustration. OS should put it in instructions and put the buttons on the outside so the battery covers do not have to be removed to access the buttons.
2,Worked great...till it didn't work at all,Not much more to say than the title. It was great while it worked. I probably used it 30 times and then the temperature stopped registering on the wireless unit. I won't buy this one again.
1,Good for one use,"My husband wanted to cook our Thanksgiving turkey on the grill. We'd never done this before so I bought this thermometer so we'd know when the turkey was done. The good news: it worked great! The bad news: it never worked again! No change of the batteries, button pushing, resetting, cursing, spitting or praying helped."
1,"absolutely useless, wasted my money","the receiving unit seems to work fine but the transmitting unit does nothing. Save your money as someone has to be making something better! How hard can it be to make this product? So I got ripped off, hope to warn anyone else that thinks this product will work at all less than as advertised. Completely useless."
3,Do Not have Enough Info. Yet!,"I hav eonly used this product 2 or 3 times since I purchased it. I have been able to get it to work well in the manual mode, but have had some trouble with the auto mode. It may be that you can not cook Turkey 'Rare'. It will only go to the 'Well Done' setting in the auto mode. Other than that, I am satisfied with the product."
2,"Works, but extremely fussy.","Difficult use - frequently refuses to work - but once you coerce it into working - it is pretty cool. It's nice you can select the meat - or set your own target temperature, set, forget - and it'll let you know when it needs to be attended to. If only it was more reliable/easier to use, it'd be perfect. Also chews through batteries."
1,This Thing is Crap,"Got it yesterday, the reciever could not see the probe. I called the company and they said you need to hold the reset for 5 seconds on each, that seemed to fix it, would have been nice if it was in the directions. I put Filet Mignon's on and set it for medium which would be 160 degrees. It was well done reading 150 degrees, thankfully I didn't rely on this piece of junk."
1,No replacement probe available.,"Bought this unit 2/10/11. Worked great, great convenience. I would still like to use it but I made a mistake by leaving the probe too close to the gas grill flame and it burned up. Replacement probes from Oregon Scientific have been out of stock since April. Their Customer Service doesn't even have an estimate when they might be available. She did offer to sell me a complete new unit at a small discount. Not acceptable."
1,Highly Disappointed. Not customizable,"Has it's on presets for lamb,chicken, turkey, beef,fish and pork. For chicken and pork (IIRC) it only lets you chose a pretty high temperature.Also the temperature range (display) is in a fairly narrow territory.I had this on 3 stars but now think 2 stars is appropriate.If you use their presets for say... medium rare beef, it will come out overcooked.I used the fish setting instead.Maybe I should give it one star because of all the ruined meals it might give you.Remember, you should be taking it out 10 degrees before it rings the bell and it won't let you tweak it to do so.OK. one star it is.The wireless works ok also.Update 7/15/2011 Broke today. False readings not remedied by resetting both items."
1,Never worked right,"It didn't work right. Replaced batteries twice, still didn't work. Did not record temps at the grill nor transmit temp, let alone 'talk'. I am returning it."
1,Good Product as Long as the Probe doesn't burn out,"Not long after I got this product in 2008, the probe burned out. Since then, I have periodically searched both Amazon and the Oregon Scientific site for replacement probes. Amazon doesn't list them. The Oregon Scientific site always offers to email me when they become available. I don't want them to have my email address, so I stick it back in the drawer. I found one for about $8.00 at Ikea. It's not wireless, but the probe has lasted two years. I find it hard to throw it away after what I paid, but after 5 years, I don't see any option."
1,try something else,"Product overcooked meat. Set for medium and with 5 minutes remaining for that result, took steak off - medium well result. Try something else."
1,Absolute failure.,"This thermometer was defective outright from the box. I went by the book, installed the batteries and reset the units before use. The main unit does not pick any radio-signals from the remote unit and consequently does not display any temperature readings. Will end up using it as a timer. PS. I have checked the batteries and they are fine.Sheer waste of money.This is to add to my previous review. I have emailed Oregon Scientific asking for customer support. 10 days have elapsed and they have ignored me completely. Moreover, in their website, there is no FAQ, nor troubleshooting information. Amazon should allow something below one star."
4,Oregon Scientific Thermometer,"This is my second Oregon Scientific Thermometer. The first one lasted at least 10 years. We were so happy with it that we decided to go with the same brand. It is so simple to use and so accurate. I like this model because it allows me to set my own target temperature. I had one slight problem with the reset button, but Tech. Support made it an easy fix and it has worked great since. I would recommend this one and even bought one for my son."
3,Pros and cons,"Pro: Works over a much longer distance than for other remote thermometers I have had. Seems pretty accurate too.Con: Very hard to establish a connection between transmitter and receiver. I finally found that this worked: put the batteries in the transmitter first, then in the receiver, then press reset in the transmitter, then in the receiver. This problem downgrades what would otherwise be a 5 star review."
1,This thermometer is absolute junk!,"It worked for approx 6 hours, then quit - forever. No matter what I tried, the receiver would not pick up the transmitter's temperature signal. I attempted to go to Oregon Scientific's website for help. It was a complete waste of 20 minutes of my life. I was unable to find anything re how to fix the problem. I now see that others have had similar issues with this item. Do not be fooled by this thermometer's slick appearance or it's ""Grill Right"" name. It is absolute junk!"
4,Removes the Guess Work,"Forget about the plastic pop-up, done meter that comes with chickens and turkeys, this is a great invention for guys that can't translate the ""cook until done"" southern way of cooking. I've also experimented with this on the grill (hamburgers) and it worked well.My only slight complaint is the distance claim - I believe the product spec says you can use this 300' away from the source, but I found that to be a stretch; this may have something to do with the inability to penetrate brick or masonry walls."
3,makes the job done and impress friends,"it is a excellent product and makes the job done. The only problem is the temperature probe, it will get damage easy if not treated as a baby, I used 3 times and it die and the replacement probe is almost as expensive as buying a new system. So after buying the new temperature probe, i am very careful in how to clean it (just wipe it with a wet sponge, do nut put it under water), roll it and store it."
1,Probe misread temperature after one use,"After one smoking session, probe read 117 degrees in 70 degree weather ( probe was in free air ). Expect better quality personally. Now I have to find a replacement probe and try to get this working to feel satisfied with investment in product. Will not purchase this brand in future due to poor performance."
4,Works great,Used it on my smoker while I did a turkey and could monitor temps inside home. Also kept track of fluid temps on my transmission while towing a load to make sure I didn't overheat fluid.
2,Frustrating unit,Limited consistency. It just does not keep working. In the middle of a cooking project it just fizzles out. The battery life is minimal so even with new batteries it just stops working mid cook. Rather then providing ease of cooking it just builds anxiety about your cook bewcause you have to watch the monitor to make sure it is monitoring. Don't bother.. it's a waste of money.
2,GREAT IDEA BUT JUNK,"Don't waste your money on this one, piece of junk. Lasted for 2 cookings then stopped reading temp. Good looking, and seems to be well made but I think the probe is where the problem is. I just use it for slow and low bbq but would not hold up under only 300 degrees or less."
2,Only worked a few times,"It worked the first few times then would no longer recieve the signal from the transmitter. Tried reset, changing the batteries, etc. No luck. The 30 day return window from Amazon.com expired a few days ago so I've got a request in to the manufacturer for a repair/refund."
2,capricious,"Temperature readings are inconsistent with other thermometers I used as a reference.Documentation is not clear on how to sync up the transmitter and receiver. Both need to be reset.Eventually, stopped using. Too much trouble. There is probably nothing better out there anyway.I haven't found any such product where majority of buyers liked."
1,awesome product,"I got this for my husband's grilling, but i use this more often. Since we got this we have no more overcooked or undercooked meat. No need to poke on meat multiple times. Works well in the oven or Grill. No need to wait by oven or grill, just take the monitor with you.update. well i didnt use this much, probably a dozen times... it stopped working - registering 400F in room temp beeping crazy. Lesson that i learned in the past but forgotten - the simplest gadget works best and longer!"
2,Pretty much junk,"Got this as a gift adnppmd had high hopes. Over all the temp seems right on and the unit works well, other than the stupid reset right out of the box.However, the voice is aggravating as hell and can't be turned off. 5 degrees out the thing will keep going off telling you ""it's almost done"". Seems like a minor issue, until it won't stop going off. A simple talk on/off button would make this unit 4-5 stars."
1,Terrible,Didn't work right out of the box. Was a gift and we never said anything because they live far away.
2,Bad Probe,"I bought one and it worked great for about a week after I'd called and reset and called and reset it. Then the probe went crazy. I was getting temps over 400 degrees while holding the probe in my hand. My Daughter bought the other brand and it was cumbersome so I put the probe on the Oregon Science device and it worked great again, till the probe went nuts. I avoided crimping the probe cable... So I'd just like someone to sell me a good probe..."
3,"Great features, but doesn't give reliable temperature","The temperature is wayyyy off. For boiling water (at sea level), it is showing numbers from 226 to 248 F. I wanted an accurate thermometer. This is clearly not reliable.Features are great. It is easy to use. The signal strength is good for remote display. But, if you are looking for accuracy, this unit didn't deliver.The probe is too thick for me as I am used to the hypodermic needle thin probe of my Thermoworks Mini Thermocouple (that is rated only upto 482 F)."
2,not happy,"To date I am having great difficulty getting this to operate. First the batteries were not good.Second, although following directions for use I cannot get it to operate it as it should. The main control will not program what I want in terms of temp. control and the unit that has the probe does not light as it should to indicate it is operating."
3,Its so so,"Took a little bit of time to calibrate it as the manual (like most these days) was written poorly. I found in some meats it works very well such as a sirlion roast, but a meat loaf that was suppose to be well done according to the thermometer was blood red inside and needed to be cooked an additional 40 minutes. While it helps, check to make sure the meat is done especially in things like hamburg and chicken. Its useful but a ten dollar regular one works jsut as well if not better. I use it but would not recommend spending the money on it."
3,Oregon Scientific AW131 wireless grill thermometer,"I bought this through Amazon.com and shipping as fast. However this thermoter was not well made, as it has limited instruction manual. When we first turn it on, the wireless receiver could not syn with the probe. There was no instruction on how to make it syn. It doesn't have 365/7/24 customer service. Fortunately, I went back on Amazon and found some reviewers mentioning resetting the wireless with the probe will make it work, and we did just that. Thank you for those of you out there posting this piece of important info.Also, the set has very limited cooking temperature for something as common as beef (rate, medium, medium rare and well) and it's kind of disappointing. I am sure this thermometer can do a lot more if their instructions are written in a more detail format.For those of us who likes to color co-ordinate our kitchen, this thing only has red color. I just don't know why red. Will silver or grey be better or much more easy for our eyes?"
3,"When it works, it works, when it doesn't, it doesn't","Amazing product when it works. Great to know the temperature of the meat from inside of the house and have warning when it is nearing temperature. However, there are times when the sensor is very picky and terribly inaccurate. One recent grilling the probe was saying that the meat was done after 2-3 minutes on the grille. At first, I thought that perhaps the sensor was placed incorrectly, but after repositioning the probe and resetting the device, it simply wouldn't work. Disappointing. When it works, it works great. However, if it decides not to work, it simply doesn't."
5,Awesome grilling tool!,Bought my husband a new grill this spring and we've been grilling maniacs ever since. We got aChar-Broil Magnum 500 Quantum Infrared 3-Burner Gas Grill with Sideburner- it cooks at super high heat so it's been tough judging correct cooking times since it works so fast. This is the answer!Everything is now cooked to perfection. Part of the infrared heat requires you to keep the lid down - so this allows my husband to set it up and come in the house without worry - it gives plenty of warning when the food is going to be done so you can get back to the grill. We also use a lot of wood chips when grilling - this allows the food to get fully flavored by them since we're not constantly lifing up the lid.
2,Not so great,"It was Ok while it worked. A little difficult syncing. After about 6 months I began to get crazy readings from the thermometer. Turns out the probe went bad. Around $15 to replace the probe. I will just buy a better model. If you do a lot of grilling or smoking, I'd invest in a higher quality product."
2,Doesn't Hold Up,"I purchased this item a few years ago. After first use the product failed. Oregon Scientific provided excellent customer service and shipped another thermometer. I rarely use this item; and because it is expensive I'm very careful with it. I am careful not to submerge the probe in water; yet the probe gave out. I contacted OS to find out what we need to do to resolve this issue and I am receiving the run-around. Yes, time has passed, but again I am very careful and this item rarely gets used. For $70, I expect it to last! At this point, I feel that I would have been better off spending the $35 for a similar product @ Walmart; where at least they have a spectacular warranty-exchange policy!"
3,Would be great if it synched easier,"Pros - Accurate, convenientCons - You have to be very specific in resetting the unit when the handheld stops receiving the base signal. Remove batteries from both, replace batteries in handheld, reset handheld first, replace batteries in base, reset base."
2,Waste of money.,"I was really excited when I ordered this and got it two days later. We immediately broke it out and used it that evening for a roast on the grill. It was a little difficult to get it to work, but once it did, boy was it great! That was the one and ONLY time it worked. The wireless feature is a pain and the two devices won't see each other. I've tried everything to get it to work again. Now it just takes up space in my drawer. Don't bother with this."
1,Would not reccomend,Started out OK but is now 25 degrees off...checked in oven and reads 227 with oven set at 200 degrees. Also is off compared to my Weber instant read. Looses the temp reading quite often and have to reset. Have tryed new batteries and reseting both units. Would never buy this product.
5,Great Piece Of BBQ Equipment,"Bought this to give me freedom when smoking my briskets and pork butts. Other reviews state that you can't set your own temps. That is not correct if you read the instructions ( I know thats not the manly thing to do) it tells you quite easily how to set your own desired cooking temp and time. Its quite versitle and the range is great. I had my smoker out back and I was at my neighbors across the street in his front yard and it still was connected, had no line of site with the base at all. Would highly recommended this for any one who want a portable thermometer for what ever you might be cooking. Makes a great gift and the features are spot on for this price range. Wont find a better buy with any other brand with out spending quite a bit more."
1,Complete waste of money,"I received this as a gift and I was originally excited about using it with my smoker. Out of the box, it synched up right away. After a few hours, I had to leave so I turned the unit off and when I came back, the piece of junk never worked again. It would synch up (I think, the controls are not very user friendly at all) but the temperature would read 572 degrees and the alarm would stay on. Tried all the tips mentioned in the reviews and on various websites to no avail. In the end, I boxed this piece of trash up and sent it back to Amazon. I would love a good wireless thermometer for my smoker so that I don't have to constantly check on it but this is definitely not the one."
1,"Oregon Scientific, Worst Company ever!","I had the older model, worked well several times then stopped. It ended up having an ""accident."" A year later I saw this newer model at Bass Pros. It worked for three tri-tips then the crazy 210 and 32 degree reading came on when it was not hooked to anything. Replaced batteries, went through the reset process...nothing. Emailed company, told I would recieve a response in three days...nothing. Emailed again and was told the probe needed replaced. I went to their site, replacement probe $12.95, shipping $9.95. Cost almost as much to ship. I will NEVER buy from this company again!!!!"
2,No tech support or longevity,"I picked up several of these when I found them for $14.99 at Lowe's and a few more for gifts for family and friends a few days later, at $9.99. I'm ashamed to have given them as gifts. The units worked okay the first time I used them in my smokers. The features are great. It's cool to be able to program the desired temperature and hear ""It's almost done."" while you're inside avoiding the 115 degree Az summer. I went to use them again a few days later and..... nothing. It turns out that they drain the battery quickly and there's no off switch. Lesson learned, take the batteries out next time. The base unit and receiver lose contact all the time and have to both be reset. The probes on 2 of the 3 I use stopped functioning after a few uses. They were worth what I paid for the $9.99 ones. I wouldn't buy another Oregon Scientific product, regardless of price."
1,Worked perfectly...ONCE,"I was really pleased with this thermometer the first time I used it. I was smoking a turkey and a pork shoulder and it was within 5 degrees of a truly accurate hand-held dial thermometer. Went to do a roast a couple of weeks later and the dang thing ""thinks"" 40 degrees is 147 degrees. I did all the reset/ battery/turn to the north while holding one leg up BS and nothing will make it read within 100 degrees of the correct temp. I bought the most expensive one that was available at Cabela's in an ongoing effort to avoid buying crap...no luck in this case...I just want things to work for crying out loud. I will gladly fork over the bucks for a high quality item whether it be boots, sunglasses or whatever but its starting to seem no matter what a guy tries to buy anymore or how much he pays, Chinese crap is all that's out there."
2,Another contraption ....,"Although this thermometer works, I find it to be cumbersome and useless on many occasions. For example it is slow to read the temperature if you take it out and reinsert it again and it cannot be used on any item that is thin as it falls over. So, useless on fish, thin patties, turkey burgers etc. Just another gadget I wish I never purchased. Overall it's a bit temperamental that does not work consistently.I'm now going back to the simplicity of a 10.00 digital probe."
3,Works when it works,"I got this for Christmas and I have used it 4 times. My thoughts are as follows:1) You have to turn on the sending unit before you turn on the recieving unit or the recieving unit may never pick, up the signal.2) The temperature is very accurate and once the signal is recieved the first time it works great.3) I burned up the probe on my BBQ, I didn't abuse it - it shouldn't have burned up but it did. They are sending me a new one free of charge and it was easy to deal with the customer service department.I am wary of using this again for BBQ. But for making beer, wine and cheese it is reliable and works great."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"Oregon Scientific AW131 Grill Right Wireless Talking Oven/Barbecue Thermometer, RedI ordered this item at the end of December since I have just gotten a new grill that cooks more like an oven than a normal propane grill. It was highly recommended that i get a good meat thermometer to use with the grill. Got this product, put batteries in and had power, but probe would not talk to main unit. Instrucions call for me to do a ""reset"" on both units, but where the word ""reset"" was, there was no button or anything else to push and no other place in instructions to do a reset. Needless to say it was a total waste of money. I do not recommend that you buy this product."
2,Kept hoping it was my fault,"I have had 3 of these units. The first one got wet with sauce and stopped working, but I can hardly blame anyone but myself for that. Then the replacement suddenly started giving wildly swinging temps. It would go from room temp to 220 degrees sitting on the table. So I ordered another thinking the probe might have gotten a short in it or something. No combination of the unit, probe or probe receiver fixed the problem. I love the fact that you can set the meat and done-ness. But I'm ordering a different brand now."
2,Obnoxiously loud,"The themometer made the most obnoxiously loud beeps when conducting any operations. It has a switch to turn down the volume, but the difference in volume is negligible. I just wanted a wireless display of the temperature without it beeping and talking to you.Also, either the syncing of the device didn't work or I couldn't figure it out, so the thermometer was returned."
1,Zippo! Bought this as a Christmas present and it did not work,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband as he planned to grill turkey breasts for Christmas dinner. He opened the package, installed the batteries, using the package directions. We also followed the tips given by other Amazon customers. No matter what we did, the thermometer did not work. It could not sync, or find the thermometer enabling the ability to let you know when the turkey was cooked to the correct temperature. (Some how the thermometer and the remote device are supposed to ""talk"" to each other and let you know when the food is at the correct temperature).We boxed the thermometer back up and cooked the turkey breasts the old-fashioned way.Amazon customer service quickly refunded our money once the thermometer was returned.Do not recommend this product."
1,Already Broken,"4 months into ownership. Used it maybe... 5-6 times? Already broken. It now reads 140deg. F at room temperature. When it worked it was pretty good except for the talking, that's unbelievably annoying and can't be turned off. I've reset it, pulled batteries, done everything that could be. Really disappointed it broke so soon."
5,my husband's best friend,My husband loves this thing. Its perfect cause it tells you when its ready. It tells you everything form its almost ready to its done and it has presettings for most Keats.
1,Worked once,"I got this as a gift and it worked great out of the box. The second time I used it however, it started reading 572 degrees about halfway through cooking a steak.I thought maybe I had pushed the probe out the bottom of the steak, but that wasn't the case. I removed it from the steak and the probe continued to read 572 no matter what. I tried resetting the sensor unit and the head unit with the same results. I tried Oregon Scientific's online support and can't get a reply.So now I have a non working product from a company that apparently has zero interest in customer service. I'd avoid at all costs."
2,Father's day disappointment,"After reading all the reviews on this product, I thought I would give it a shot! He has tried several thermometers but none of them have proven very good. I was optimistic when ordering this one for my husband for father's day. I felt confident that it would work for us if we used the information in the other posts to reset it properly. After trying several times, the current temp won't display. The main unit is showing no signal to the transmitter. My husband is perfecting his pulled pork recipe and is deeply disappointed that we can't make this new gadget work. I haven't given up yet and will keep you posted if I have any luck."
1,"Save your money - all form, no function","A seemingly well made and attractive unit, but as indicated in numerous other reviews, the unit simply does not work well, if at all. My own unit worked well, twice, then the third time, with a chicken ready to roast, the sender could just not communicate with the base station. As has been mentioned in other reviews, the manual is very poor and troubleshooting tips non-existent. After taking advice from other reviews I replaced batteries and reset units, etc, etc... This fixed the problem for 10 or seconds, and then nothing again - signal lost. This product seems to be just far too problematic. I should have opted for a non-wireless option. I will not be buying other Oregon Scientific equipment again any time soon..."
1,Disappointing,"The unit did not/would not work. I followed the instructions to the letter several times, and the transmitter and receiver would not talk to each other. There is nothing in the instructions on what to do when this happens. In addition, there is nothing on the manufacturer's, Oregon Scientific's, website telling you what to do either. I was very disappointed, and would not recommend this item to anyone--another example of a poorly made item from China."
2,Temp off and Set Up Directions Poor,"I purchased this thermometer for a pork shoulder, I couldn't get it to work. After some time of playing with it, I realized you have to hit both reset buttons on the transmitter and thermometer at the same time (wasn't on the directions). Also, I have two instant thermometers that I tested this with, the Oregon consistently stated the temp was 3-5 degrees higher than my two instants, it may not be that accurate. Roll the dice with this one."
2,meat thermometer,I have a terrible time getting this to work right. One time it will start ok and the next time I just give up. I am not satisfied with it.
4,GREAT FOR CANDY TOO,"When used with grilling and oven cooking of meat, it works as advertized but you may wish to revise temps for rare, medium, etc.to you own taste which may be different for various types and cuts. Tried it out when wife was making peanut brittle. Cooking to just the right temperature is critical. Worked like a charm. The need to reset both the transmitter and the receiver and the when, how and where to do it is not well covered in the instructions."
5,Totally worth it!!,"I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He was so thrilled! We love cooking out on the grill, and he's a self-proclaimed rib master. The only problem is, when we smoke ribs, we can never tell if they are pink because of the smoke, or pink because they aren't done.This thermometer takes the guesswork out, and since it's mobile, we don't have to get up and check on them every 5-10 minutes.The features are sort of confusing to make adjustments, so read the instructions, and it's easy to get the hang of. I had no issues, and it looked and felt like high quality when it came out of the box.I have already recommended this product to my coworkers and friends!"
2,"Very disappointing, and it all started out so well!","I was very impressed with this player at first. It was a bargain, and nice and lightweight. I was thrilled to find that even scratched CDs didn't skip and played well. However, I noticed after about two months (without having used it excessively), the CDs, even new ones, did not read as well as they had done at the start. 4 months later, it will play about 40 seconds of a song, and then the CD will just keep spinning with no sound, and no reading on the display save for the ""Sorry"" message. I was careful handling the product, and certainly didn't use it 24/7, so I can't understand why it doesn't function properly anymore. Now I have to search for another walkman!"
2,SL-SX290,"I purchased this CD player for my daughter. Although the features are fine, I question the durability. She has had it for about a year and it constantly skips and/or does not recognize certain CDs. I plan to return it. I would recommend spending a little more for a quality unit."
2,Simple and Amazing,"at first, i was thrilled with this product. my only complaint was that it didn't display the amount of battery left. yet, abruptly one day it just stopped working. if you're looking for a cheap player to last a few trips, this is it. but if you're looking for the real thing, i'd suggest spending a little more money and buying the atrac3 player sony makes"
1,Incorrect Item received,"I ordered the book 'Remarkable Women of the Bible"". This was not the book that I received. I have written three e-mails asking for instructions on getting the book that I ordered. NO RESPONSE, and I still have the book that I didn't order!"
3,A musical comedy...not a Skelton romp,"If you're expecting a Red Skelton comedy romp, you'll be disappointed, because this a PLEASANT MGM musical comedy set at the time of the advent of horseless buggies. Red has some nice comedy turns, but this is no ""Yellow Cab Man"" or ""Fuller Brush Man"". However, Red comes across well as the bungling inventor and leading man...and playing the male love interest to Sally Forrest's female lead. The color is mostly quite beautiful, although the mountains off in the distance made me laugh since the setting is supposed to be Red's home state of Indiana. The print is excellent, with a few seconds here and there where the color seems to fluctuate, but you may not notice it at all. In 1951, if you wanted the wacky Red Skelton you could find him on the small tube, while on the big MGM screen, he was still a musical comedy star that was a bit sedated...perhaps showing his range as a performer. You'll like this film...you just won't be laughing out loud."
5,Excuse My Dust,"I have been waiting for this Title to be available for a long time . I was a projectionist in Australia and rememberscreening this movie many years ago . Warner Bros have done an excelent job in bringing this MGM product on DVD , the original trailer in all its glory with the glittering type titles that MGM had at that particular era , and thequality of everything makes the cost off this disk worth every cent . To me , this is one of Red Skelton's best andfuniest comedy's , which has not lost any of it's charm over the years . I give it five stars , it's worth every one .I am waiting on The Yellow Cab Man ,and The Fuller Brush Man , c'mon Warner Bros , do your stuff ."
4,a reader from new york,"I think the first reviewer is being a little unfair towards this book. Yes, it skips around chronologically, but the aim of the book is to give the reader a taste of life in the diplomatic service from its beginnings to the current day, not be a biography of particular wives. On the first, the book succeeds very well. We hear about the glittering parties and receptions as well as the downright appalling conditions some families lived in (well into the 20th century, by the way). The wives are often in just as much danger as their husbands, and they are usually unpaid! Katie Hickman does a laudable job of giving these (mostly) admirable women their due."
1,Not all that great.,"I picked this up at the bookstore on base hoping it was something I could relate to. Boy, was I wrong. Don't get me wrong, the plot wasn't bad, but the main character was someone that would be an embarassment to any squadron. Ellie Avery was either complaining about the demands of being a military spouse, or being a mother to a 5 month old baby. I was especially dissapointed with the portrayal of the one enlisted spouse in the story. THe author made them look like bored housewives, who were only qualified to shop and get a minimum wage job, while the officer spouses were educated and busy. I would read book 2 if I saw it in the library or was offered it for free, but I wouldn't spend money on it."
2,Not Enough Mystery,"I tried to read all three of her books, they are alright the first fifty pages after that I loose all interest. The characters are your typical characters nothing new or exciting about them. I think that I will skip this series."
4,Moving is Murder,"Good story, Familiar places since I live in the Northwest. Heroine is believable. I'd purchase the next one in the series."
4,Cute,"A cute quick read. Not too easy to figure out who the culprit was, but nicely concluded. Would recommend if you enjoy a light mystery."
1,Another member of the H07 club...,Can't believe Panasonic didn't do a recall on this item.1 year and 24 days later.. H07 error.It's now ready for the garbage bin.Thanks Panasonic I hate you!
1,Another H07 error,"I have been messing around with my Panasonic for two days now thinking maybe it had a bit of dust. It is only a year and a half old. I finally decided to do a search on ""Panasonic H07"". Many, many hits popped up. I really wish I would have read these reviews before I bought this heap of trash. With all the other feedback related to the H07 error I suggest that you do not buy a Panasonic."
1,1 year and 3 months - DEAD,"I thought this was such a great unit when I first bought one that I bought two! One for the family room and one for the exercise room. Now one is dead. Judging from the other reviews, it is due to a flawed spindle motor installed with these units. Error code HO7. Now I am just waiting for the other to die.I am really disappointed with Panasonic. I used to have great luck with Panasonic. I recently had a Pan phone die too after just over a year. I am going to switch to Sony."
1,H07...H07...H07,"H07...what more can I say. This piece o' garbage is pathetic. I can get 1/2 way through a movie by keeping the case off and starting the video by spinning the disc with my finger, but it still dies after an hour or so."
1,Humidity -- simply awful,"Stay away. Whenever it's humid out, the disc freezes and the system shuts down. Buy this if you live in Arizona. Otherwise, stay away,"
2,Disappointing!,"I strongly discourage prospective customers from buying this DVD player. It does not meet required standards. When I first used this player, I experienced problems with both the picture and the sound quality. It should be modified in many ways. There are many shortcomings and flaws. It sometimes malfunctions for no apparent reason! Finally, do not buy this product! Buy a Sony player instead!"
1,H07 error fixed with a little oil,"For those of you that are getting this error code, try a couple of drops of 3in1 oil on the motor spindle. Ours died a couple of days ago and I opened it up to find the dvd not spinning. A couple drops of oil on the shaft, work it in, and we're back in business (for now)."
1,"h07 error too, broken player after 7 months","I had my player for 7 months and it just now stopped. It will cost about 100 bucks to repair, and I'm sorry, that's not worth it. I bought a new player today, NOT a Panasonic. I suggest you buy something that has at least a 1yr parts & warranty deal, or get it at Best Buy with extended 2yr warranty. But yup, this was quite frustrating, even though I liked it as long as it lasted."
1,New members of the club H07,We've just joined the club of H07 as well. I'm sad. Hope this review would stop someone else from being sad.Happy shopping.
3,Doesn't play SVCD,"I purchased this as an addition to my existing DVD player to play SVCDs I made from home videos. I picked this one because it was fairly cheap and some reviews said it would play SVCDs. The one I got didn't play them at all. It turns out that to play SVCDs in this machine, you have to burn them with a special hack to make the machine think they are VCD (lower quality). What a hassle. The medium rating is only because it didn't do SVCDs specifically. As a DVD player it worked fine and was good for the money."
2,Joined the H07 Club,"Like the other reviewers here, mine lasted for almost 2 years - worked great, never a hint of a problem. Suddenly the H07 shows up - and THEN I find these reviews. Panasonic - are you listening?"
1,Panasonic CV52 H07 Error,After 16 months my unit displayed the dreaded h07 error. I phoned panasonic and asked them what this meant. They said that I should take it to an authorised repairer. I did. they told me that the repair would cost me $230US in parts excluding labour. I got slugged $20US for the initial quote and suspect that they never opened the unit.I phoned Panasonic and complained about the high cost of repair (The unit cost$350US) They said take it to another authorised repairer. They did NOT answer my question about why the part may be cheaper from another repair centre and did NOT offer the part to me. I have since sourced the part on the web for $110 US.I have stated that I believe that it is a manufacturing fault. They respond with it is out of the warranty period.As per suggestion of another I went to google and typed in Panasonic and H07 and was horrified with the number of hits.
1,H07 Error Code,The Panasonic DVD-RV32 worked fine for 8 months and then an error message began showing up - H07. I have no idea how to get rid of it and the manual is no help. I'm not impressed with my new paperweight.
5,My first DVD player,"My introduction to playing DVDs was very satisfying with this machine. If you are worried about missing some of the advantages of playing VHS tapes with DVD, this is the machine for you. When you play VHS, you can pull the tape out and go back to play it later at the place you left. With DVD, the machine must actually remember where this is and this unit can do that. FF is very much like VHS. Monitoring the time left and time spent for a DVD is easy to do.The remote is easy to use, although more often then not I am pointing the wrong end at the unit.You can play music on this unit too. The performance here is satisfying although not up to vinyl standards on an old amplifier not set up for digital audio."
1,H07 just after the warranty ran out,"Like countless others I've gotten the dreaded H07 (spindle motor has died) error just after the warranty ran out. My dissatisfaction grew when I realize that this seems to happen to almost all of the units sold (judging from the response I got when web searching on ""Panasonic H07"") and yet Panasonic has done nothing about it (aside from set labor changes high enough that you could buy a new player for cheaper)."
1,How to fix the infamous H07 error!,"I had mine for about 22 months before the infamous H07 error showed up. I found a couple posts from people that oiled the spindle motor inside and got theirs working. I gave it a shot having nothing to lose but a paperweight. I opened her up, W940'd the top of the spindle and then on the spindle shaft in between the 2 plastic disc trays. After about 15 minutes of playing discs and cleaning excess oil off of DVD's, the oil finally worked itself in and now works like a charm!Warning, doing this may void any warrenty, but saved me from having to junk it."
2,How to possibly FIX the dreaded H02 / H07 error codes,I have a DVD-RP62S which is basically the same unit and after about 1 year I too started getting the H02 / H07 error codes.The DVD tray would not open and when it did the DVD would not spin at times so it's definitely something with the motors.I was able to get the player working again. This is how...I opened the DVD player and removed the drive from the unit then I took WD40 and sprays both the top spindle and the bottom cooling vents of both the motors thoroughly and that seemed to fix the problem - for now at leastWorth a try before you throw it away
1,Another H07 Paper Weight,"9 months of pretty good use, then squat. The people who are writing positive reviews about this DVD player haven't owned it a year yet.Smells like a class-action suit to me. Where do I sign up?"
4,Good Present for Family,It is one of the most affordable yet quality DVD plyer. I bought this for my sister for Christmas. She like it and the there's a neat graphical display when you do the set up. Only thing she misses is that it takes only one DVD at a time.
4,Non-Instant dry milk from Amazon,"I make yogurt from our fresh goat milk. It requires some dry milk. Our local supermarkets have all switched to instant, it does not work, it is an inferior product, made for the ""Instant"" world. The Bob's Red Mill is just what I had been searching for. It smells and tastes good. The 4 pack sold on Amazon brings down the cost of my yogurt.Even thought the milk has been heated before adding the dry milk, I sometimes have had difficulty getting the small limps out.Maybe in cold milk this doesn't happen, but in hot, boiling, it does. Other than that it makes a great product. before finding this product on Amazon, I was ordering non-instant dry milk from a dairy in Wisconsin, from there to the PNW, the shipping was very expensive, so, way to go Amazon!"
4,warm water,A good value in powdered skim milk because it is finer powder so you usea half cup to a quart. Finer powder means harder to dissolve so use warm water.
4,tasty and fragrant,"Milk prices in my tristate area have gone through the roof and not returned to lower levels despite oil prices falling in the past month. Although I don't use this on a daily basis, I welcomed the chance to buy in bulk (not big bags anyway) because I hate running out of milk."
2,too difficult to mix!,The extreme difficulty of adequately mixing this dry milk makes it unsatisfactory to me. I switched to Saco.
4,A good product,"The taste is good but I prefer taste using 2/3 cup instead of 1/2 C of the powder. I prefer it to others that may have additives to help dissolving. Mixing is best done in a blender with 2/3 of the water, scrape the sides down, and let sit overnight until bubbles deflate, then fill to the 1 quart level."
1,Impossible to get lumps out,"It's almost impossible to get the lumps out of this short of using a stick blender. Also, the bags that the milk comes in are very weak. I dropped one from my counter top and milk power went everywhere."
1,Does not mix well,"Unless you use a blender to mix your milk powder, this does not incorporate well by spoon. Even with a blender, it tended to cling to the sides of the blender. I have never had a problem with any of Bob's Red Mills products, except this one. Sorry!"
2,Powder is too fine,"This milk powder is too fine. With your average supermaket dry milk, you can just sprinkle the powder into your oatmeal and it will dissolve. This stuff, on the other hand, turns into chewy clumps unless you reconstitute it separately with a whisk. As a result, there are still three bags of this milk powder sitting in my cupboard, unused.This milk tastes fine. It's just too much of a pain to use."
2,Creamy but pain in a** to mix,"Creamy but very, very difficult to mix- even w/ hot liquids. If not for ""no-return"" would absolutely have returned for refund."
4,"Good taste, but hard to mix.","I really like the taste of this dry milk.I use it since I'm lactose intolerant. However, it's really difficult to mix.i tried a whisk as per the instructions, but finally had to resort to a blender. Other than this drawback, it's really good."
5,fantastic...dry milk powder...(big upgrade from powdered milk),"I am the only one in my house that uses milk. I also make my own yogurt. This product is terrific. I use an immersion blender in a quart jar to mix up the milk it takes seconds. The immersion blender makes quick work of it. I use someone's suggestion here to make yogurt. I just warm water to 110 degrees blend it with yogurt (as a starter) and the powdered milk I am using a 3:1 ratio which makes a nice thick yogurt. I might even reduce the amount of powdered milk. This is a great product.I will buy again. If you're having issues blending the fine powder spend $20 buy an immersion blender which you will use for many many things...I use mine several times a day for one thing or another. The quality of this milk is great, definitely decent for drinking, excellent for cooking or making yogurt."
5,"Desertpacrat, Hidden Valley, Az.","I don't drink fresh milk, so when I'm baking or cooking something that required milk, I usually end up throwing away 3/4's of a quart of spoiled milk...so I try to keep powdered milk on hand. Grocery store powered milk is big $$$'s. Bob's Red Mill is the answer, it should be your's too!"
1,unmixable powdered milk,This is the worst product we have ever used. We had to toss it as you could not mix it. What a nightmare. It should not be sold
4,Fun,This is an exellent toy for all ages. Its educational porpose is about the dogs body parts. It is soft and i think it is very soft. It is a great gift for all ages and almost the very best friend.
5,My granddaughters adore this dog!,"I purchased this dog for my younger granddaughter's second birthday but her four year old sister loves it, too. This is especially happy since she is very afraid of real dogs. The girls use it regularly to lounge in front of the den TV - it's that big and full of cuddly comfort."
4,A huge darby dog!,"He is very soft and long enough to be a rug for two kids to sit on and watch television or just hang out. With both legs and paws tucked under this gives more room for storing and a child could easily sit on him this way since the back side is higher up and quite round.We keep this dog inside our Jump-O-Lene for both my autistic sons to lounge around on. They seem to love dragging it around the house, gives them some kind of comfort. This is the closest we will ever come to a dog due to my asthma and the kids&#65533; disabilities, but there is no barking or clean up to speak of."
5,How can a stuffed animal be this much fun?,"Simple - it's HUGE and it's comfy and it's extremely durable, having survived 3 kids in terrific shape. We have Darny and now my son wants Darby so Darny will have a friend. I can't tell you how delighted that special child in your life will be when he or she sees this awesome dog. It's truly worth the price, and there aren't a lot of toys I would say that about, much less a stuffed animal."
4,Good recipes but some errors,This book has many good recipes but the proportions are off sometimes. What should be 2 quarts sometimes ends up becoming 1.
1,Stay away from it,"This systems seems nice, looks nice, but is extremely unreliable. After 4 months, it stopped reading disks. The drive motor is cheap and burns out quick. All that fancy design and features means nothing if the disk won't spin. Panasonic has been using these motors in most of their players. Just avoid the brand name."
2,This System Is Lame.,"A good friend of ours bought this set-up last week. Tomorrowhe's taking it back. Our 200 watt Koss C220 sounds much better,and it's 125 bucks cheaper. Both were made in China, where elsecould a system so cheap be made? Save your money and buy the Koss. If you want a real system, spend around five grand."
3,Not good after 2 years!!!,For the first two years it worked fine. I have 3 kids under 5 and let me tell you--- it would play for hour after hour some days. However I did think it would last longer than 2 years for the price we paid. It started with skipping on new DVD's. Then the DVD door wouldn't open --it just froze. Now the DVD will not even read or even try to spin the DVD. We have done regular cleanings due to frequent usage. However it sounds like 2 years is as long as this will last. Save your money for something that will last longer.
4,sounds good,Panasonic SC HT 75 is overall a good sound system . Bass is deep & well extended as compared to other like priced systems . Some what weak in high notes / frequencies . Lacks a bit on shrills & high frquency sound effects . Not a too loud system but quality wise it does holds you . In a modest priced systems it is much much better than others .
4,sound's good to me,"This is a very good system for a non-techy. I have found that the surround sound is adequate while the overall sound is quite good. For the $, its definitely worth it."
1,Think twice,"I bought this system over the weekend. It worked for a couple hours, then it started to freeze up. It wasn't able to read ANY dvd's or cd's, it wouldn't let me change the cd or even open it. Luckily after turning it off and on a few times I was able to get all of my cd's out. I assumed I had just gotten a ""bad one"" and went back and exchanged it for the same model, minutes after hooking it up I was having the exact same problems."
4,Easy Set Up,This system is surprisingly easy to set up!Overall sound is very goog for DVD's.Good for CD's but listening to the TV through this system has proven to be somewhat of a challenge.
4,Bland but filling,Though a bit bland for an Osprey book the books of this series Stuart Reid has produced are insightful for those interested in the troops of this period.My only complaint being that they do not cover the American colonial formations of this period or the various German troops Britain also employed
1,Quits working soon after installation,"Installed one on VW Beetle. Worked fine for a month, then it quit (no power on the terminal to the fuel pump when oil pressure is present). Installed a second, new one. Worked 1 month and quit. Installed a third, new one. Didn't work right, straight from the package: keeps fuel pump running after engine shuts down. All three switches were correctly connected, and there's nothing wrong with the fuel pump. Oil pressure is good -- new oil pump, fresh oil.This switch appears to be a piece of junk. I am hooking up a fuel pump relay instead, which creates an electrical solution for the fuel pump safety requirement, instead of a mechanical one.Order this item and waste your money. Highly disappointed."
1,Worst Dead recording ever!,I guess there was a real reason why the Dead wasn't included in the original Woodstock documentary.It was a bad night ... it rained a lot. They had sound system problems. But whoever recorded this wasnot really in a good position to record. And was using inferior equipment - even for 1969.But there must have been an official recording from the main board that could make a decent CD. Maybe someday.
2,good songs but the sound quality sucks!,"i may have only one song from this bootleg, 'High time', and when i heard it man oh man does the sound quallity suck! even though it may not be on amazon anymore but still come on it was probally recorded on 8 track really! i would rate it 2 and a half stars the sound quallity just ruins it."
5,Excellent costume design resource,"This is a wonderful book with and opportunity to see how the physical period clothes actually drape on a form. Close-ups on the weave and details of the garments are also informative. This is a great book for costume designers who are tired of guessing from paintings on the historical accuracy of how things fit. Made for the designer not the seamstress, I'm afraid."
5,Superb UK costume reference,"This is a wonderful book! And I'm not saying that just because I'm English and I know intimately the Paulise de Bush collection (one of the collections featured in this book.). It deals specifically with the history of European costume (not American or ethnic costume - sorry, US of A'ians!) as reflected in the collections of English houses and collections in the National Trust, and has mouthwatering images. A MUST for all costume historians and fans of the art of antique costume. It is unfair to complain that this will not be of any help to the seamstress, because that was not its aim. It is intended to overview the changes in English fashion as reflected through the contents - paintings, engravings, drawings and actual textiles - of Stately Houses and holdings belonging to the National Trust. WONDERFUL book for the social historian of English fashion, and of interest to anyone who appreciates costume for its own sake."
2,The size they tell you is way off,The bag is no where near as big as the add says. It may be half that size if you are lucky unless Prada has a different way of measuring.
3,Honey I shrunk the Prada.,"... to my dismay this bag was a bit smaller than the dimensions detailed. The print on the duster was a bit more smudged than the dusters of my other Pradas, which I have purchased from a certain department store. This duster bag also only had one strap, while all my others have two...hmmmm. Besides that, it pretty much looks like the picture and I now use it as a make-up bag."
5,A Timeless Classic in Cookbooks,This is a cookbook that everyone should have on their shelves. I have used this cookbook many times since I was on my own and married (twice) since 1977. The recipes in this cookbook are easy and very tasty. My favorite is the Cheesecake recipe. The cheesecake tastes better and is much fluffier than those from The Cheesecake Factory. This is a cookbook that can be handed down from generation to generation with its timeless recipes.
5,"Powerfull, hard hitting, sad, tragic & heart wrenching drama!!",Very well made HBO mini stories based on real occurances in Vietnam and at home. Brought tears to my eyes even after all these years! Whether you were there or not a must see for anyone who was alive back then and also it can relate to what our troops are going thru today. A MUST SEE!!
4,I'm a VN Vet,"I was pleased to be able to order this as it helps me with comming to terms with myself and what I expercienced. I do not keep comparing myself to everyone else, that we all had our own story."
3,Bitter Disappointment,"I'll agree that this was an excellent series; but I bought the 2-DVD set specifically to get one episode: It was the final episode of a 90 minute 3-episode set. The set was entitled ""The Last Days""; the episode was ""Dirty Work"", a story about the evacuation of the Embassy and specifically the CIA staff. It is not on either disk. None of the three episodes is. (The other two were ""The Last Outpost"" and ""The Last Soldier"").I bought this in the understanding that it was the complete collection. It is not."
2,boring!,"I bought based on other reviews, they liked something I didn't. A series of short stories that I endured 3 of before I gave up on it. Any one want to buy it, I'll gladly sell!"
1,Keep the song on Mute dig the Video,"I keep the song on Mute,but watching J-Lo's take on ""Flashdance"" is nice on the eyes.She can't sing Herself out of a paperbag but the video is worth the pain of hearing her voice."
3,NOT so glad about this song...,"I thought this was one of the weakest songs off ""This Is Me...Then"" and I am so happy for her that her much better song ""Baby I Love U"" is doing better. First off I give it 3 stars because she wants to proove to the public that she and Ben still care for each other, and also the music is very good. But the only fall back are the verses which are lacking. I think she should have released ""You Belong To Me"" the remake of the Carly Simon hit or ""The One."" Sorry Jen but I think this single wasn't a good choice but I still love ""This Is Me...Then!"" and the video for ""I'm Glad"" REALLY makes up for the song!"
1,Not Even Close To Being Glad,"For Jennifer Lopez, she has been declared the Milli Vanilli of the Latin industry, largely because she hasn't proven that she can really be a credible singer. Although she is a strong actress, she still fell flat on deaf ears with touring. With her latest song, I'm Glad, the song doesn't really capture exactly what the song is about, where the video speaks a different language, a flop. Unfortunately, the video seems to speaks within tuning towards a tribute to Flashdance that is manufactured, and not showing her voice as a real singer. I do admit she dances well, but she still needs to prove it on tour. Hopefully, she'll think about it, once Ben Affleck and her overexpose their careers and not each other."
4,"A nice, mellow set of Brazilian guitar music","A mellow set of jazz/acoustic guitar work, which ranges from moments of Metheny-ish electrified echo to bouncier, Baden Powell-esque romps and quieter, more exploratatory moods. It's pretty nice. Amorim is joined by Brazilian bassist Ney Conceicao and the ever-ubiquitous Robertinho Silva on percussion... It's a quiet, compact trio that lets the guitar stay front and center."
3,It works but it doesn't stay in place when moved,"The biggest problem with this piece is that when it rolls on its wheels, it loses its grip on the server. Which is kind of the point of a stand.Update: after reading my review on Amazon, the company offered to replace the stands for me with newer versions. That was very generous, but I declined because the stands work well enough and I didn't want the hassle of dealing with new ones."
3,"Looks clever, but not for slim computers","I purchased this because the product description implied that it was adjustable for different width computers. I needed to use it for an IBM computer that has a standing-up width of only 3 inches wide. While this stand was very easy to put together and does narrow to that dimension, it is extremely unstable/""top heavy"". I've had to wedge it between my desk and a chair and I'm worried that if anyone bumped it, it would fall over. I've tried swinging the wheels out to expand the base and make it more stable, but the wheels spin back in with the slightest movement.I would NOT recommend this product unless you have a low-wide/squat computer."
1,Unintentionally hilarious,"Basically a Jack Chick mini-comic stretched to book length. If this book was taken seriously, it probably would've raised some eyebrows. It is so amateurishly done, however, that it cannot be taken seriously.Only worth reading for lowbrow entertainment, this self-indulgent ""reference"" shows the typical dangers feared by the ""satan-worship-conspiracy"" crowd (rock music, D&D, etc.).Since the author has recently covered (on his radio show) the evil conspiracies behind Barney the purple dinosaur, the evil messages espoused by The Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, and the time that a demon took human form and impersonated Bob Larson himself, we can only hope for a sequel."
2,Larson's best book. Unfortunately that says very little.,"Better written than his other books and a lot more informative. But.............. The invented dialogues are really inviting laughter. There are better, more scholarly, books on satanism."
1,Forget it,"I have had the displeasure of reading this book, andhave found it to be even more inaccurate than most books ofthe ""Satanic scare"" genre -- and that's saying a lot.I know a great deal about role-playing games and a littleabout the contemporary occult scene, and I was astoundedby the abundance of errors and internal inconsistencies,both small and large, throughout it. I don't agree withLarson's message, but I feel that even those who dosupport this viewpoint will be setting themselves up forembarrassment if they try to use it to bolster their case."
1,"Unmittigated, uncompromised garbage. Do not purchase.",A cursory examination of this book reveals that it is poorly researched and full of falsehoods and in some cases fabrications. A thourough examination of this book reveals the extent to which Larson has not done his homework. To wit: Dungeons and Dragons is NOT a game in which characters kill EACH OTHER with poisons and spells. Anthrax and Metallica are NOT Satanic bands. Practisioners of Wicca DO NOT worship Satan. The list goes on and on. This is nothing new to Larson; apparently he has a reputation amoungst fundamentalist Christians as a liar and a fake. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Instead check it out at the local library. Read it and understand what kind of junk people are willing to believe out of xenophobia and paranoia.
2,A wonderful example of a wrong-headed fellow Christian,"I am a devout Catholic - not fanatical, but devout nevertheless. If I had not been doing research on Christian fundamentalist paranoia for a school paper, I wouldn't have read this. Larson reiterates the same old prejudices which have been discarded by mainstream Christianity since the false horror stories of Satanist cults in suburbia of the Eighties. In fact, many ""conservative"" Catholics and Protestants no longer listen to these fairy tales."
1,Classic (unintentional) humor,"One reviewer observed that you should do research before you write a book, but since Larson doesn't actually write his books, no one should expect him to do research, either. This literary monstrosity was wrought by a grandmotherly staffer in her 60s (as uncovered in a federal lawsuit; the matter was settled, and the file was sealed), who frankly knows more about knitting than Satanism. And it shows.Even though this book has been out of print for years, as of this writing it still sells better (#311,486) than Larson's new ""best-seller"" (~#385,000) exploiting the Columbine tragedy."
3,Christianity At Its Worst,"If you are searching for an accurate representation of Satanism in the modern world, you are looking the wrong place. I would recommend Anton Zandor LaVey's The Satanic Bible. However, if you are searching for good bathroom reading, look no further! Bob Larson at his best. Just what the world needs, more drivel from fanatical hypocrites with over-active imaginations. Exactly when Dungeons and Dragons, Metallica, and peace signs became indications that a child is worshiping Satan is beyond me. This from the same man who, on his radio show, repeatedly damned Glenn Benton of Deicide, and then called the man at home to tell him that he is loved by God and by Mr. Larson himself and that he too could be forgiven of all his sins. Isn't it just beautiful? And the scariest part? Some people actually believe it.Ave Satanas"
1,Right along with Pat Robertson,"If you want a book for a laugh, get this one. It is the god-damned funniest thing I've ever read.And I never purchased it, just took it out at the library. I don't recommend it, however, to serious folks. Read it on the throne, or when your bored, burn it on a bonfire- just don't take it seriously!"
1,"laff along with Bobbo the Clown, kiddies.....","Ignorance is excusable. But presenting a combination of pig-ignorance and outright lies as a guide for raising and protecting children is beyond inexcusable. I shudder to think of the damage done to innocent teens by parents and teachers who took this book seriously. If you can put that disturbing thought aside, however, the book is hysterical in the sheer absurdity of its misinformation. I guess that makes Mr. Larson an evil clown in the classic sense."
1,give me a break!,"... This Bob Larson guy has the nerve to call Metallica asantanic band! He also says that D&D, Black candles, and thehippie peace symbol are all sighns on satanism.What I'm trying to say is that this book is good for nothing more than a good laugh. I really hope that someone ... just put this in the wrong section because only a moron with the I.Q. of ketchup would take this book seriously."
1,Can last up to two weeks if used as toilet paper!,"I havent got such a laugh since Howard Stern's: Private Parts. This book clames that Heavy Metal, black candles, D&D, and wicca are all satan related. Man, I must be Satan himself or a close relative. I like just about everything the book says is evil. Anyways, if you find yourself taking anything this book says seriously you might want to try smacking yourself on the head a few times, it the problem continues throw the book away."
1,Pure propaganda B.S. over events that never happened,"In the 1600s it was the Puritans looking for witches in town hall, in the 1950s it was McCarthy looking for communists under the bed, and in the 1980s it was Bob Larson looking for imaginary Satanic Cults, well, everywhere. Let me put it this way: Larson lists a page of ""Satanic"" symbols in his book, which include (among others), the Egyptian ankh, logos of rock bands, and the peace symbol. You can imagine what the other 200+ pages and the rest of his books are like. His mind is obessed with this ""Satan"" character, so naturally he sees it everywhere, and he wants to share his paranoia with the rest of the world. Please don't buy this book, even for laughs, because this liar doesn't deserve a cent. If you're looking for an actual researched book on the myths and facts of the Satanic Panic, try the book by Robert D. Hicks."
2,oops! was that an UPRIGHT pentagram???,"The author has gone to a lot of trouble to explain the seriousness of Satanism's lure for young people on today's society. But instead of rooting out the evil in youth - why not focus more on the good inherent in their young souls? And by the way, an upright pentagram is the symbol of Wicca - a completely different religion that doesn't even believe in Satan! Do more homework next time, thanks!"
2,Scare tactic nonsense,"I only gave him that extra star because he actually did *some* research. That certainly doesn't mean he isn't a bias conspiracy theorist, though. I noticed he loved to harp all over those interviews with kids who talk about killing and wanting sacrifice for Satan. Some of the info he provided was actually factual, but it was still very much hyped up. It seems he really only put emphasis on the unstable wackjob teenage extremists.One thing I couldn't help but scoff at - why the hell did this guy keep refering to bands like Slayer, Metallica, and Megadeth as ""black metal""? They are nothing of the sort. If any of you guys (and girls) who swallow every word this windbag says as truth, forget the little league of the ""Satanic metal movement"" and look into some real black metal bands, such as Mayhem or Emperor, to see what the scene really incorporates."
1,Written to cash in on a craze. Worthless as a reference.,"What a mess. Basically a Jack Chick mini-comic stretched to book length, this nonsense is full of all of the standard 80's urban legends about all the children who were killed by rock music and D&D. It would be funny if there weren't gullible people out there who would take this stuff seriously. If you're looking for a useful book on the occult, try Gordon Melton. If you've got a short leg on your kitchen table, go with Larson :)"
1,Worthless Drivel,I bought this book for a laugh at some bookstore and definately paid way too much for it. Don't take it seriously but it's actually extremely funny as long as you read in small doses. If you read too much of it at once the gag reflex will trip.
2,from one brainwash to another brainwash,"this book was interesting to me at one point. i didn't grow up in the USA so there are some points in this book that can be difficult for me to understand, that is if there's anything to understand. i do think that the teenagers are very easily influenced and brainwashed, and many of them are ready to take out their anger on others. it is a serious subject that needs to be discussed. and Robert Larson here, has a sens of analysing the motives of a teenager, but i do not think it is by converting satanists to christians that he is going to save the world and the youth. (...) i was surprised by the heaviness of prejudiced christianty in this book. and i think Robert Larson has lost his point there. he is proposing one adiction instead of another. i think the book should have been left based on psychology and his radio program instead of judging everything and proposing solutions that aren't even just!"
1,Bob loves evil,"I read this book a few years ago and I was mentioned in the book. Mentioned WRONGLY and INNACCURATELY. Basicaly Lar$on used his radio show one summer to lure naive teenagers to call, and the results he used to fill a book his STAFF wrote.This is his schtick to make $ off of ""demons"" while claiming to be a Christian."
1,Ignorance,"This book is full of lies. Even though I am not a Satanist, I have read The Satanic Bible by Anton Szandor LaVey. Bob Larson should learn what Satanism really is before writting pathetic books like this one. After reading this book, I thought about returning it (selling it back to a used book store) but I tore the book into many pieces because nobody should have to read this type of ignorance sold to you by a man who knows nothing about the subject he wrote about.."
1,This is the Yishua,We're gonna go ahead and give you a code red. I'm a five star general. There is no love on the barracks! He's stuck in the middle ages; that's how the middle ages ended was with Luther's 95 Theses. Bob Larson is very poor. I inherited like 40 million dollars from Anabaptists centuries ago and live in a mansion. Wake up. Most of these people are in the military. I'm a Marine. Code red!!!
1,THE BIGEST LIE EVER,"whoever wrote this book is the most miss-informed right-wing intolerant stuck up peace of crap that ever lived. Everying that is not christian, he labels as satanism, for instance the peace sign and wiccas. he says that heavy metal is SATANIC and that to me is very offensive. off, course i agree w/ him on certian bands such as RAMMSTIEN, MARALYN MANSON, and ROB ZOMBIE, but labeling such metal acts as IRON MAIDEN and DIO as satanists, is pure sh-t. if he took time to read the lyrics he would find that he is gravely mistaken. He has not researched this, but just labelled everything that he doesnt agree w/ as satanic. HE IS WRONG."
1,Not the same 80's DC from So. ILL,"Just for the record, this is not the same band from Southern Illinois that was on Mystic records in the 80's. Cannot comment on this record in all fainess since I only heard the song no.9 that I shared with the members past and present in the real DC, got one good review out of six of us. But for more info on Diet Christ check out msigarmy.com, the site is down now but we are looking for a new host, until then. We diet for your sins.I gave one star for each positive member review on the one tune no.9."
3,A quick fix...,"I bought this because my mom was staying with me while recovering from an illness. It gets the job done and is stable enough if you just need to steady yourself while entering or exiting the tub. However, it was really hard to install and I would never recommend it for anyone who needs to put all their weight on it. Additionally, despite following the directions, the adhesive pads removed some of the finish from my tub."
2,"Short, fundamentals only, horrible examples","Part of the value of books on photoshop, particularly ones about digital photography, is in showing you how to take reasonable shots and make them better. In these examples the photos start bad and sometimes get worse. The problem is visible even on the cover. The photoshopped flag looks awful.Definitely not the book for digital photographers looking to get the most out of photoshop. I recommend O'Reilly's Digital Photography: Expert Techniques instead."
3,Just not loud enough.,"I dont like this walkman very much and am sorry I bought it mainly because the volume is not loud enough. When I go running, I want to hear the music, not strain to listen to every word/note. I have no idea how that guy in the review below can mow his lawn while listening to it. He must be Dumbo. When you are on a walk, the volume and sound quality is great. However, the controls are hard to locate sometimes because they are so small. The remote thing hanging off the headphones are more annoying than helpful. Also, it would be nice if these walkmans came with some kind of loop so you can hang it off your belt. This one doesn't. The good things about it are that the batteries seem to last a long time and the sound quality is pretty good."
2,Badly manufactured?,"I bought the SL-SX390 on the basis of the great reviews... and, yep, it worked reallllly well for a while. No skippage, great battery life, and great sound for the price!Except... it's a fragile little beast. Unlike the other CD players I've had in my day, this one's just not good with outdoor activities. It's not like I dropped it repeatedly - it's just fallen apart through everyday use. And so, five months later, I'm shopping for a new CD player because the little CD spinner is now slightly warped (how THAT happens from normal usage is beyond me.) I'd give this baby a 5 for battery power and anti-skip technology, a 4 for volume, and a negative three for lasting power. That's an average of two, gents!"
3,It's ok,Medicore shock protection and terrible for people who like training to music. As an immobile player though it's great. I would rather suggest one of the Rio players since they have very good shock protection and are much stirdier.
5,Long-term machine,"This machine is reliable for any use. I must have dropped it about twenty times, and it never faltered. Great buy."
3,one more thing...,"I forgot to mention, a radio does not come with it. Why they don't put one in, I have no idea."
3,Not a good option for playing audio CDs,"As an Audio CD player this unit has two big limitations: 1) POOR DISPLAY. The player only displays the track and disc #. To see any more info, you must turn on your TV. 2) SLOW RANDOM PLAY. It takes about 15 seconds to go from track to track in random play. So forget about using this unit to play random music tracks - the delay is too unnaturally long.This is a fine unit as a DVD player, and ultra slim at 3"" tall. I just don't know why anyone would need the carosel function on a DVD player."
4,Great changer no problems here(MP3s work great),"DVDsI have not found any DVD this player can not playMusic Discs(CDs)Random PlayProgrammable play listRandom Play mode works both on a single disc or multiple discMP3 FilesAll of the above work an MP3 disc(CD-r)! This player has played all MP3 I have tried, however I generally just ripp MP3 from the original disc. But, for best results you should only use MP3s that have at least 128k encoding. This Unit will display the list of all titles on the TV screen with long directory and file names.In addition, I have found the unit to be easy to use."
1,"Broke after less than a year, lost two of my DVDs","I was quite happy with this DVD player for the first five months. However, into the sixth month, it started to have trouble switching discs. Sometimes I would open the tray to find two discs on top of one another. Then tonight, it decided to lose two discs. Now it won't close, it won't turn off unless I unplug it, and I can hear the two discs rattling around. Customer support has been absolutely useless and the nearest repair station (the warranty no longer covers labor, by the way) is very far away. I don't own a car right now. All in all, I'm not too pleased with the player."
1,Very poor Service,"This DVD lasted just over a year. Panasonic DVDs have a problem with the Optical Pickup Unit. This DVD also had the same problem. One fine day (just after the 1 year warranty period expired), it started showing 'No Playing' message for any disc I used. Although I live very close to a Panasonic Service center, I could never reach them before or after work since they are open only from 9am to 5 pm Mon-Fri.There is a class action suit pending against Panasonic for selling faulty DVDs. I came to know of this only after mine broke.I would not recommend this player to anyone."
1,What a disappointment!,"We bought this because we wanted to play CDs DVDs and MP3. It did that well but only for a year. It stopped playing in the middle of a CD and displayed ""NoDisk"". It refused to open to get the disk out. I had to take the case apart to get the disk. Their web site is no help at all looking up the error codes.It has always been difficult to get it to play the disk you wanted it to. You just can't select a disk; you must first stop the player then select the disk. Very bad programming interface."
1,Dont Waste Your Money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this product seven months ago and have had nothing but problems. When I got it home the carousel would not stay open. So I took it back. Within a week of the labor warranty running out the Laser Processing Unit went bad. Fool that I am I paid to get it fixed. Two weeks after the gaurantee on that unit ran out it quit working again. I tried e-mailing panasonic but of course mysteriously that aspect of the web site was not working each time I tried to submit my complaint. Shocker!!!!! Save your time and money and stay away from this money pit.
3,Know the limit,"Disks it doesn't play: DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD-RW(once rewritten, there's gibberish.)Changing disks and getting the right one in, out, or to play is as anti-intuitive as possible. The UI screams for improvement.But, everything it claims to work works so far. I enjoy the 5-disc capacity once you figure out how to load and play them."
4,I need to defend this unit,"... The sound and video quality is incredible, which is why i purchased it. After reading about the disasters some people had with operation, i had to see how bad it really was. the answer... really not that bad. the remote is poorly designed, but aside from having to hit stop twice to reset a disc, it's pretty easy to use. it's not very responsive to commands if it's already in process, but considering it costs ... has a 192kHz D/A converter, a five disc tray, progressive scan, and outstanding picture and sound (running the optical wire), i would highly recommend it."
2,Does not play Chinese VCDs properly,"When playing Chinese VCDs, the picture appears stretched such that the top and bottom are off the screen."
1,Bad Design and Bad quality print,"I bought this DVD player thinking that it's great value for the price with all the functionalities.But I am not satisfied with the picture quality, since it has distorted images often. Also one of the movies that I played on it had brighteness changing from dark to light throughout the movie. Also the it takes a long time for the power to turn on."
1,Disappointment,This is my 3rd DVD player. I've never seen one this poorly made. This Panasonic changer has annoying motor noises when reading low number chapters. Its a design problem. Don't waste your time and money. Don't Buy This PIECE OF [JUNK]!
5,Great!,This is a wonderful book. I don't believe that it should be your first book in topology. But for sure it will help you to get a deep understanding.
3,I paid Full Price and don't regret it!,"Although this is so much better than the other Dover book by R. Vaidyanathaswamy, I can't say that it is the best topology text that I have read or the best reference, but it covers topics from Banach spaces to functional topology in a pretty readable manner and it is fairly inexpensive!"
2,Disappointing,The title is misleading. This is a book about matting with two paragraphs about framing. I expected to learn how to build frames not how to buy them.
1,poor description,"The add said this cover would fit a Honda EU2000i gen. I have one and the cover didn't even come close. I was so disappointed. Maybe the seller place the wrong cover in the box, but it was labeled for the Kipor IG2000. the cover that was sent semmed to be for a Kipor IG1000.I sent it back and had to pay for the shipping even though I feel it was their mistake. Bad Ebay Seller. Bad."
3,"Okay, but not worth twenty bucks","Most of the information in this book is easily found elsewhere. The author spends more time debunking orthodox Christianity than discussing agnostic belief, which is what I was looking for. Maybe that means that agnosticism is only a reaction to orthodoxy, rather than an independent system of belief. In which case I would have been better off spending my $20 on the latest ""Garfield"" collection and a cup of Starbucks coffee. Still, if you're looking for some basic information on the flaws of Christianity in a readable format, this makes for a good reference work."
4,"Pretty nice overall, but spouse gets to wake to the buzzer","This was our second attempt to find a CD clock radio with battery backup and dual alarms. Reception is great, and audio quality is consistently Panasonic (great!) The battery backup will retain the time during power outages (not just for two minutes like some of the other units), but the ""dual alarm"" feature is slightly deceiving. With this unit, you can choose (for each alarm) whether the left, right, or both speakers will be triggered by the alarm. Unfortunately, ""alarm 1"" is CD or radio (with frequency and volume preset as part of the alarm), but ""alarm 2"" is the buzzer only. Granted, it is a relatively pleasant buzzer. This is yet-another piece of consumer electronics that is just this close to perfect, lacking only a tiny bit of software to overcome an obvious shortcoming."
2,poor quality,"I returned this item and took a big hit on restocking fees/ shipping, etc, so i am a bit bitter. i should have got it from amazon. why did i return it?1) the build is poor quality plastic.2) the sound was horrible. i could not get any decent radio stations. (i live near downtown) even the cd player was of mediocre quality."
4,Gunsmithing,"Great book, Mine was Autographed HA HA, seriously, mine had some spline wear but always happy with the people on Amazon. I can tell Horror stories on Military Book Club. I am a Book Buyer, Reader, Collector... and those People losta great Customer. i'm Happy"
2,No Hose or Hanger!!,"Great revues but no one mentioned the fact that it does not come with any needed accessories! No hose (which costs about $22 at local store) and nothing for it to hang from or connect it to the shower pipe (which costs about $11 at store). What?! So, this no frills shower head ends up costing over $60 (nearly $70) when all is said and done. No thanks...sending it back. I'll go get an all in one Delta or whatever."
4,Perfect Replacement,"This spray head was a perfect replacement for the near identical shower head that was installed in our 1999 motor home, with one important difference: The old one had hard plastic spray nozzles which had clogged with calcium deposits and fine sand-like particles, and this new one has rubber nozzles which should be clear-able with a brush of the hand. I am disappointed that neither the old or the new shower heads appear to be able to be disassembled for cleaning. Hopefully the new one one won't need it."
4,Works Great,Pros: no longer ending my showers in a cold spray.works well for someone who is Handicapped.Cons: the switch is a little easy to shift but prob my hand is to close to the head.does not come with it's own hose.
3,splish splash,"this shower head functions well but the water pressure leaves me feeling like the old song "" is that all there is "". it would be perfect if the water flow was just a bit faster. other than that i have no complaints, the flow pause works well and the unit looks good but the slow flow is a disappointment for me."
5,I can't believe it!,Lightweight but putting out a nice even spray. The thing that blows my mind is the package said Made in China but the product had stamped on in MADE IN USA! Congratulations on realizing that it's the people here that makes the economy work and I will continue to buy your products because of that.
3,Backpackers beware,"This game is a fun way to take Cribbage anywhere, but there are a couple issues. First, the pegs are too big to place in adjacent holes, so it's difficult to count by one. Second, the set is heavier than I expected. Though this makes no difference for normal day activities, it is a bit of a load on the trail. Still, it's fun to have."
5,Clark's original,"The most comfortable shoes as my boyfriend says, it's like slippers.He wants to get the black ones now. He purchased the brown oily wallabee."
5,Good-looking shoe!,"I ordered these shoes for my son and he loves them! They are a good-looking shoe that my son says fits him well and are very comfortable. This same shoe was in our local stores but not available in my son's shoe size. Because of this, we decided to look online via Amazon! And I am so glad that we did because the price on these shoes online was much lower than what they were in our local stores. My son and I are very satisfied with our purchase and have decided in the future, we will shop online for his shoes in the future. Thank you!!"
5,Comfortable knockaround,Not many products as consistently good as Clark's Wallabee boots. For casual shoes they can look good in slacks as well.
3,Nice if you do not walk much,"I can understand why this shoe receives so many positive reviews. The leather is highly breathable, and the rubber sole is very soft which make you feel like walking on thick carpet.However, the insole is very slippery (I don't know if this is intentional!), so unless the size is small enough and fits your foot completely, your foot will move around as you walk, causing injury to toe skin if walked long enough. I wear shoes with size US size 10 very comfortably, but even if I wear size 9 of this one I still hurt my toe skin."
2,Felt like I was walking on skates.,I'm used to having shoes and boots with wider soles than these had. I was in fear of rolling my ankle so I returned them. They seemed like they would be comfortable once broken in but I didn't give them a chance out of my fear of injury.
5,Timeless Boot,"If you want a boot that you can wear when your 18,28,38,48,58,68 years old, this is it. They even look good on females too. Hands down Clark's makes a timeless shoe. When your done chasing ""new"" styles every season and realize that clothes are just a silly waste of money (besides a great watch) get two pair (Brown and Black) and call it a day. Ver comfortable as well and look good in khaki or jeans."
3,Cheaper than anywhere else-get whaat u pay for,Price reasonable but shoes were scuffed up pretty bad. Almost returned them but shined up instead...didn't expect to have to do that with $90 shoes.
5,shoes,these are excellent shoes And are made of the highest quality material I would definitely buy them again they are very comfortable.
4,Cool Cool!,"But get an insole. The bottom, inside and out, is too smooth... :)Otherwise, great! Go Walter White. Long live Walter...."
2,Poorly made.,"As with many Clarks Wallabees, one shoe was wider and longer than the other. They didn't feel very stable either. For quality, they are clearly seconds.I would have returned them if I had ordered them from amazon uk."
5,Lovely Clarks,"I got these for my husband because he loved his first pair so much. The pair I got (the taupe suede) was a lot lighter than in the picture. In the picture, they are a rich brown, and the ones that came are a light grey brown, but it is a still a lovely color and I think that my husband likes them even more than the pictured color."
5,great product,i am happy to inform because actually i got this item without paying moneyand selling process is always perfect
2,Are you kidding me?,"Are you kidding me? I have lived in Wallabees most of my life. I wore them back in 1970 up until 2000. Why on God's green Earth is the most minimalistic shoe $100.00? Especially, when it is made in China? I loved Wallabees, I don't know who Clark is, but they are bending you all forwards to pay that much money for a bare bones shoe. I'll stick to any shoe that I can find that is American. Sad state of affairs. I recently bought Caterpillar and Wolverines. Both were solely American, now parts of both shoes are part American and yet mostly from other countries. Even K-Swiss went down to communist labor. I am truly sickened by Clark going with a one-hundred plus price tag on a shoe that was adored by hippies for just being minimalistic foot-wear. Shame on you Clarks and I am truly sorry for those who just went with the flow. I am giving it a 2 because I like the shoe, but WAY TOO OVER-PRICED!!!"
5,Awesome,This shoe is by far the most comfortable shoe I ever worn. I wear this show everywhere. Very pleased. Can't wait until I put them on again
3,Nice shoes - sizes run bigger than normal shoes,"Excellent quality shoe but the size of the shoe runs at least a size larger than most other shoes you buy. I normally wear a size 13, I ordered a size 13, and now I must wear a very thick sock to make up for the extra room. I believe a size 12 would have probably fit just fine."
5,I Love It,"Love it, comfortable sole, proper height heel, fast shipment, good package, quiet while walking, just not that bright surface, but it is very good already."
4,Great Fun!,"This game is very entertaining for adult groups. It makes you think, laugh and is just a good enough challenge for everyone. Great fun!"
2,"Not useful, not readable","This tiny little 3""x3"" book may have a couple of somewhat obvious ideas but overall there are much better books out there with real ideas and strategies for getting a raise or negotiating salary. Try Jack Chapman's ""How to Make $1000 a Minute"""
5,Her Autobiography for a Younger Audience,"This was a great biography of Kerri Strug, though it was meant for a younger audience and reading level, it was still very appealing. It included many great pictures, and her biography. I think all Kerri Strug fans will enjoy the book, nevertheless how old they are. Great book, awesome pictures!"
1,Still Have not recieved,I ordered this back on Jan 13th and have still not received it. There is no way to contact a seller. Not happy
4,Terrific Dolby Digital package with MP3 playback!,"This is a very unique system. In addition to being a good bookshelf stereo system, it functions as a DVD player with a built-in Dolby Digital 5.1 decoder. I wouldn't recommend making this your primary home theater device, but in a second smaller room it's terrific. Rear channels are crisp and clear, and my son loves watching his movies now. Subwoofer has decent rumble.As an added bonus, you get MP3 support. The MP3 support seems quite good; it took VBR and 320kb/s CBR files without a hitch, on both CD-R and CD-RW media.My only complaint is that if you have another digital source (like, say, a Playstation 2 or Xbox) you can't connect them up to get digital surround. You can, however, hook up an analog source (like a VCR) and get Dolby Pro-Logic, which is better than a poke in the eye.We've had it now for some time and it's had no issues. Highly recommended.--chris"
2,"Its ""nice""","I had higher expectations I guess. The MP3 support is the main reason I bought this product but I've come to find that it is impossible to navigate MP3 CDs without the stereo being attached to a television in order and even then its a pain to go through.I also underestimated my want of hearing everything aside from the DvDs I'm viewing through stereo which you won't as theres no input into this machine.It is pretty though and sounds lovely, its just not very usefull for the amount of money I invested in it."
3,Good book; but minimal web application,"One of the key reasons I purchased this book was to get more information about publishing FileMaker databases on the web. One of the first things the Synopsis mentioned was publishing to the web without CGI's. I was disappointed to discover it only covered the Web Companion plug-in and only barely more in depth than the manual. The bulk of the book covers database design, and does that well. It includes dealing with relational design which I found insightful. But without getting in depth with web applications, I found it to lack the scope which it made itself out to have."
4,"Good, but needs a few more things to be great","Good: Wonderful explanation of functions and scripting. I have created some neat stuff with the help of this book. Bad: Several typos; a few errors in functions (which caused me 45 minutes to figure out why a fn wasn't being recognized by FMP); too much stuff on layout design. Thin discussion of FMP servers/cross platform issues (FMP server for NT mixed with Mac clients). Useless info covering WEB function of FMP (kinda thrown in at the end, and a rehash of an FMP manual).Conclusion:I use this book constantly as a reference for scripting and functions. Excellent! Don't expect too much more than that... but then again, no book can cover it all and do it well."
2,Where's the web?,"I was hoping to get some background on CDML and putting my databases on the web.However, the web is barely scratched and looks like it was thrown in haphazardly as an afterthought. Even the flimsy manual that ships with Filemaker 4 itself is a better web reference than this book.Advertising the Web on the cover of this book is very deceitful."
4,Perfect for the Realistic Crossdresser,"Charles Anders has written a great, common sense instruction manul for the cross-dresser with excellent tips for folks of any gender. I truly appreciated his emphasis on the small ways to shift gender, recognizing that very few of us (men or women) have the capacity to truly transform into glamorous starlettes -- instead, we just want to look pretty. The author is very body positive with helpful advice that is better than any I've ever read."
4,Good but not for everyone,"This was a good book to help me out of the closet and onto my college campus (and even into some of my classes) Since reading and actively using Anders advice many of my friends have commented on how ""realistic"" I am starting to look! It is unfortunately though not for those whose ultimate goal is passing as it is simply for the ""casual cross dresser"". Anders suggests wearing clothes casually and even says he rarely uses breast forms. I tried his laid back method integrating small aspects of femininity into my daily wardrobe, a foxy t-shirt here, a pair of stretch flare denim jeans there, but it wasn't enough and my friends found it confusing (I have since decided that I can not live with out my breast forms). This casual method works for some but not for all, so if that's who you are this is a great book, if passing your only goal I would not necessarily suggest it."
1,Fancy cover,"Fancy cover. Lost about 6 lbs right after stringing and before hitting any ball, and it kept getting looser. It reached 40-something or 52- and I had to change it ASAP because it wasn't very good. The feel wasn't very nice. It might work for you but it didn't work for us. It could be the frames that didn't like that string, but it might work for others. It just wasn't close to a hit for us."
1,A waste of money,"Well presented? yes. But that's about it.If you are looking for an Outline of definitions than this book is for you. If you need any substance, skip it. Foundations, for example get almost more space in the title than they do in the book."
5,"Estate planning for the rest of us. Clear, concise & witty.","This is the Harold and Maud of estate planning. A book about planning your own death that will make you laugh and that you can cuddle up to like a good novel.Paul Rampell's Immortality Made Easy may be the first book on estate planning written by an attorney with a sense of humor. It is cartoon-simple and filled with heart. Every page speaks to the real concerns about planning for loved ones that most of us harbor, but never fully address. It brings a complex area of law to a human level. Halos to Immortality Made Easy."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Very poor workmanship, would not hold pressure. Cost me an entire tank of CO2.. Returning it as soon as possible."
1,Don't buy this,"I have already lost an entire tank of CO2. This is very poor quality. The valves have to align pointing exactly at the out tubes to not audibly leak. I am pretty sure they still leak a little anyway. I had to remove the gas in port and put more silicone plumbers tape on the threads to fix that leak. I regret buying this. For the amount of CO2 you will lose, it is worth getting a good quality dual or tri-regulator."
5,Great armchair review !,"This is a very fine film. There are more than 15 veterans of famous ocean races from around the world interviewed between segments of footage from ""on board offshore"" in seas ranging from 12-20 feet, with all the important major points covered.There are some short bits of footage from round the world races from bigger seas as well.The emphasis here is on newer sleeker fin keel designs from the last 20 years though even the owner of an older sailboat w/o much on board heavy sea experience should find the review helpfull.The production itself is First Class!"
5,JB is BACK! Woohoo!,"We have waited a long time for new music from John Berry, and he does NOT disappoint with WILDEST DREAMS! Each song is sung with the heartfelt emotion that we are used to from John.SALVATION shows his vocal prowess more than any JB song I've yet to hear. RIVERS IN THE CLOUDS has the most incredible vocal imagery. And UNTIL I'M LOVING YOU is one of the most powerful tunes I've ever heard.There is no other male voice that compares to John Berry, and this CD should zoom to the top of the charts!"
2,Too bad you can't just buy the single,"I love the single from this album, ""Power Windows."" But it's not available as a cassette single so I bought the whole album. What a waste! None of the other songs are as good as that one. There are too many slow, uninteresting songs, so the album sounds like something you could fall asleep too. But ""Power Windows"" is great."
1,Wow!,"This album is righteous!! John is the best!! He's got so much soul, you can't confine him to one musical genre!!"
2,Three years wasn't worth the wait,"I love John Berry's voice, and it's been three long years since an album. I thought maybe he retired! Then I saw this & decided to try it. It's not full of the usual emotional performances we have come to expect from John Berry. It doesn't move me and doesn't make me cry. The emotionalism isn't there. I guess I will keep playinig Standing On The Edge and put this one away."
2,You are paying for a car charger,"The case is worthless because it does not fit the phone. The ear piece also does not seem to plug nicely into the phone without shaving away some plastic. So basically the only usable component is the car charger, which I have not used yet."
2,Dont buy,"I bought this and the case is junk, the charger is horrible... I returned and bought mine from a company called the wireless boys, llc and am pleased."
2,"Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing",I bought this package mostly because I wanted the car charger. I was only able to use it a few times before it broke because the product is so flimsy.
1,DON'T BUY THIS THING EVER,"This thing is crap, don't buy it. None of it works, just don't buy it. Nothing more need be said"
1,Beware this TV is Made In Mexico!,I bought this hunk of junk TV five months ago as a Christmas present to my mom. Yesterday it conked out.Now I have to go thru the hassle of getting it fixed all because Panasonic wants to boost profits by having it's TV's assembled in Mexico. They only have to pay workers 50 cents an hour there....you get what you pay for. I'll never buy anything with Panasonico's name on it again.
1,I got NAFTA'd,"I fell in love with this TV from the start. It was between this and the Sony Wega, but the reviews seemed to good to be true for the Panasonic, and oh yes, they are too good to be true. Getting it home and unpacked was a Herculean task. Setting up the colors so that the red didn't fry your eyes was the next obstacle. Finally, I relaxed and enjoyed this TV for the past 14 months. Tonight when I turned it on....poof! The screen painted bands of colors around the outside and the picture's center was black and white. I am disappointed to learn that this thing is made in Mexico, plus the fact that for over $400 you'd expect a TV to last for more than 14 months. That's pathetic. I had an old Signature 2000 Mongomery Ward RCA 27"" TV that lasted 7 years even with the cold solder joint problems. Shame on you Panasonic.I've been NAFTA'd."
2,"good picture, but stereo sound is poor","The picture quality is very good. But the sound is poor. The speakers are small and separated by the entire width of the TV screen. The sound seems disconnected from the picture, which is very distracting. Even when sound is set to mono, the sound quality is still poor. The on screen menu....well, I've seen better and easier to use."
3,Excellent camera but only for awhile,"I bought this camera for Christmas 2005 and at that time it was a great deal for small and good quality pictures (4MP is still pretty decent), but 2 years later the flash stopped working without any reason."
3,Worth the money,"This camera takes good pictures in bright light, otherwise don't waste your time. The pictures are pretty hit or miss. I commend Samsung for offering a camera at this price point and it's durable. This is a good camera to have handy b/c it's $100 and is better than getting the disposable variety. It's a point and shoot, let's not forget."
3,Samsung Camera Review,"A decent camera for the money. Menu is a little cumbersome to navigate, but it takes a good picture"
1,Good for about 2 seconds.,You will be really lucky if this camera lasts you 4 months. I've gone through two of these in 6 months and they die really fast. Either the flash stops working or the entire thing just doesn't work.Not worth the money.
2,SO-SO,"The battery, which you have to supply yourself, is terrible...worked 10 minutes, replaced them and it worked for a couple of pictures. It does not have a re-chargable battery. There is no card included either. I should have thought about this before buying but assumed that all new cameras have a re-chargable battery. I think i will return it."
5,new camera,"I just purchased this sweet little camera. I have been having fun with it. I was a good consumer and read the instructions before using, I haven't really used a digital before. This is easy, and I played with it today. The first six photos weren't perfect but were good. I will have fun with this little camera. It's just the right size to put in my pocket and go."
1,Disgraceful Samsung digital camera,"I guess I really shouldn't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally. But the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a Samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you can't even tell what you have taken. If you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars. Even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did,on this useless piece of CRAP!"
2,Ugh!!!,I got this camera for my birthday last June. I thought it was a good camera. And it was for a while. But a month or two ago the flash stopped working. So now the camera is pretty pointless and useless seeing how the pictures are really dark and you can't tell what you even took a picture of. I would never get this camera ever again. Watch out!!!!!
5,Zen Master Seung Sahn was my original teacher,You are expecting an objective review? 35 years later I still read and re-read this wonderful book even though he told his editor to throw it into the garbage because he so much wanted people to find their own truth and not be attached to his words. How great is that?
2,Looks great in picture but...,"The barrel is nice heavyweight metal and although the grip looks ok, it is a cheap hollow plastic which makes the piece very unbalanced..if this is tucked into a sash or belt, the unbalanced weight could make the pistol slip and fall. With the grip being hollow, you run the risk of cracking the plastic."
2,Eh...,I'll admit the book came within just a couple of days of ordering but I didn't get what I paid for. I ordered a NEW copy and the book I received had multiple highlighter/pen marks on a number of pages.
5,The Humanistic Tradition Book 5,"Good product, arrived ahead of schedule, and in new condition as advertised by seller. Overall I experience no problems."
4,Reliable Recipes,"I have made a few baked items from this book in the short time I've owned it, and each one of them came out quite well. That alone, to me, is worth the money I spent on the book and ingredients. As many home bakers can attest, there are many baking books that are of the too-much-hype-little-delivery quality.The recipes I've tried are: Sour Cream Coffee cake (increased cinnamon just because of personal taste), German Chocolate Cake, Triple Chocolate Brownies, various cream pies, Corn Muffins, Chocolate Souffl?, Lemon Meringue Pie, Lemon Pound Cake, and Key Lime Pie. They've all been successful and the work involved was not anything close to arduous.The only reason I give this book four stars instead of five is because the recipes are for very basic baked goods. There aren't any items here that will deliver any WOW! effect. It's a good, solid, no-nonsense baking book with can't-fail recipes and techniques. However, don't expect any marvelous creations."
2,Hit or miss,"I bought 7 of the America's test kitchen / cooks illustrated books at once. I like th idea of what they are trying to achieve. However, I feel the recipes are successful about 50% of the time. Initially I though it was me, but I generally have no problems following other oook recipes. The oatmeal raisin cookies in this book came out soft but cooled into bricks.If you are trying to learn why things are done, I think Alton Brown does a much better job. Also the recipes are consistently better - in my experience."
5,Awesome,"Fantastic guide for nearly every baking need. Thoughtful, beautiful, and detailed so as to truly teach you the ""why's"" as well as the ""how to's"" of creating awesome food. Learn artisan bread baking technique, and make the best chocolate chip cookies ever! Baking Illustrated will quickly become your go-to-guide for impressive home baking. It for sure is mine -- I reference this cook book throughout the week, especially for bread."
5,"Excellent Book, But there's an error","I like the way Cook's presents recipes. They tell you how they experiment which give you, the home baker, the skills to experiment on your own! This is great.There are a lot of recipes here and they are all well-written. Please note, there is an error in their Basic Pie Crust recipe. It should be 1/2 cup of shortening rather than one cup. This was sent to me in an email from the America's Test Kitchen website."
5,watch out for repeats,"If you already own The New Best Recipe, this book isn't required. What I mean by that is that at least 80% of the recipes in Baking Illustrated is already in The New Best Recipe, if not more. I didn't do a thorough count-through but a lot of the recipes are repeats. Of course, I give 5 stars because I love the explanations and the layout of the book.If you absolutely don't need the few extra recipes Baking Illustrated offers extra from The New Best Recipe (and you already have The New Best Recipe) then go for another cookbook.Onto the cooking aspect, the explanations are a plus. The instructions are clear and I've made a couple of the recipes so far and they came out great (even with a mess up on my part)!"
4,Good book could use some more pictures,Tried the Pizza recipe from this book so far and it came out good. Could use more pictures for the recipes.bbb
2,A little disappointing...,"As a beginner baker I found this book totally uninspiring; 500 pages thick without very many photos. Normally I would never buy cook books without beautiful illustrative photos, but because this one said ""Baking Illustrated"" with excellent ratings from other customers I assumed it would be wonderful. I'm not even motivated to try any recipes here because they are really text-heavy and written in such a complicated language like others previously commented. I am now further turned off by the fact that some of the reviews here say the recipes contained typos."
5,Review of order for Queen Victoria's Sketchbook,"This was purchased from Sabal Books. The book arrived very quickly and in flawless condition, even though it was supposed to be used. It was also very cheap. I could not be more satisfied."
2,Good until you wash it,"It wears well unitl the first wash. Upon removing it from a gentle cycle in the dryer, I noticed that threads all over the robe were unraveling including both belt loops."
1,Horrible customer service and product,"received battery From Longlast battery, replaced, it worked but overheated ipod and charge didn't last as long as replaced battery. Sent it back as defective, they received it, and actually emailed that they received it and said they were mailing out new one, and it NEVER showed up. They don't answer emails or phone calls! Horrible horrible customer service. DO NOT BUY, if you have trouble with the product, forget it. And forget it if they claim a lifetime warrantee on products, they won't come through for you."
1,long last battery,The battery came on time. I followed all of the directions and the battery didn't work. I went to the long last battery website they had no solutions no tech support. The site was only worreid about selling the product but not having good custmor service. I put in my old battery and the ipod works fine. Go some where else if you need a relpacement battery
4,very nice,"I bought this system yesterday, and after after checking Consumer Reports' site, I picked up the Philips mc-50 because it was a ""best buy"" according to them. I spent 2 hours comparing the two systems, side by side with the same music, and this little system (PAN SCPM07) outshines the Philips in sound quality bar-none. If you aren't looking for a rock-the-house system, but a very clean and clear bedroom or kitchen radio, this is it, I am extremely happy with it.. I will be returning the Philips..."
5,Great Movie!!,Without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time!! Tom Hardy is great in the movie. This movie is done very well. Everything from the acting to the cinematography is great. It's unbelievable that this is a true story too
3,3 Stars,"Charlie Bronson (Tom Hardy) -- who's been jailed for nearly 35 years -- attempts to dissect the real man behind the deranged persona. While Bronson's primary ambition was to be famous, he became a celebrity of sorts as a criminal who seized myriad opportunities to demonstrate extreme and terrorizing savagery.full review @[...]"
5,Tom Hardy as Bronson is an Instant Classic.,"Bronson is one of the best movies I've seen in a great while. The camera angles and crazy story line make this product a must have for any collection. Tom Hardy's acting capabilities show that he is a force to be reckon with, especially with his natural ability to catch the audiences attention. As a viewer I didnt know much about the story of Michael Peterson (Bronson) but this film definitely brought some insight into the mind of England's most expensive inmate."
2,Rent dont buy.,"Do not be fooled by the title and box art; Bronson is an art house character study that fails on both fronts. Tom Hardy gives a great performance but is let down by the direction and script. Despite the copious amount of exposition you never have a great understanding of the character or his motivations, at best you have a shallow depiction of a seriously flawed individual. At the end all you know is the guy wanted to be famous."
3,Uncivilized man,"I'm not sure what the goal or vision of the filmaker was. The movie was interesting. Tom Hardy is a great actor. He will go far. Interesting is the thought I had after watching the movie. There are some people that are simply outside civilization. They justthug their way through life. They don't get it and they never will. When faced with freedom the Bronson character didn't have a clueor skills at a normal life. Just his fists. Bottom line, certainly worth checking out."
3,Hopeless,"Acting was fantastic. But the character of the protagonist was so gross that there was nothing you could do with the movie to make it likeable. A totally empty individual who loved pain and loved to inflict pain and never redeams himself is worthless. The warden that appears at the end of the movie knew what and who he was dealing with. He did a great job in the short amount of time to tag Charlie. I liked it well enough to stick through it, unfortunately I thought he might gain insight into why he created his own chaos. He didn't, nor did he try. Sad through and through."
5,BRONSON,"This is one of the most interesting, fun, disturbing and stylized movies I have see in years. I stumbled on to the trailer and was sold. I bought the DVD and have enjoyed it several times. Many of my friends have borrowed it and gave ""Bronson"" rave reviews. I highly recommend this film. See the trailer then buy the movie."
3,Artumentary?,"This movie is an arthouse masterpiece. It has the color, feel, intensity and show of high performance art but as a movie it just somehow misses the mark. Don't get me wrong the acting, directing and photography are here in epic and stylish proportions but any sense of actual storyline is swallowed up by quick film edits and theater.Tom Hardy is amazing and takes the role of the real life BRONSON, Michael Peterson, into the top tier of acting talent. He's that good. Peterson/aka Charles Bronson is Britain's most violent prisoner, which the film easily demonstrates but I'd rather have seen more of the actual dark journey involved than quick snippets and high art.I actually think that I liked the extras and commentary on the DVD more than I liked the film."
1,Should not be viewed!!!,"This movie is below average. It shows scenes of male nudity, extreme violence and transvestite-like characters. The only thing that the plot builds upon is that there is one guy called bronson, and he is very violent. Thats pretty much it!!!"
1,Resources wasted on a self-destructive brute,"Why a movie was made about a man who liked to brutalize, kidnap, demean and torture others is astounding and a waste of resources. His kidnapping and sadism against his art teacher who tried to help him, completely destroyed any sympathy I may have had for him. Bronson is a complete psychopath and this movie could have focused on a more humane person."
1,Boring,"Waste of time, pointless, mundane, boring, blah, rather watch paint dry. Their are a million other movies better than this."
1,This is one of the worst movies I have seen,"I am a fan of ""different"" movies, i was gonna order the blu ray to this b/c i found this guys store fairly interesting..but thank god i didnt and rented it.. It is boring, tasteless, with no plot, take my word for it.. its complete garbage"
1,What a waste....,.... of talent and other resources. This story could have been told better.You will find better film on teeth...
5,Thumbs Up!,"I will admit after the first 10-15 minutes I was questioning my choice in watching this movie, HOWEVER....man am I happy I hung on!Tom Hardy gives a near perfection performance....I only say near since I am not familiar before this movie with Charles Bronson and had never seen any footage of the actual man to know if Hardy did a perfect performance.It was funny, (I found my self laughing out loudly at some scenes) emotional (I actually felt some form of sympathy for the character and curiosity (causing me to research a bit on the man to find out more about the real Bronson)This is a gem of a movie, worth checking out and the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic!An enjoyable viewing experience!"
4,"Great Perormance, Good Movie","Tom Hardy is magnificent in this movie, and that is probably understating it. Sure the movie is offensive and about a person who loves chaos for the sake of chaos. And that is why this movie is good. It is about a man, with a normal upbringing, a decent family, but is wrong. He loves madness, and that is all, he does not love madness because of childhood abuse or any other outside force, he just loves it. Great performance by Hardy, Good movie."
2,"NICOLAS WINDING REFN, OPUS 6","Don't worry ! Even Refn, during an interview, confessed that he didn't understand Bronson's psychology and that he put a lot of himself, of his own dark side, in the portrayal of the hero. Moments of surreal poetry alternate with raw violence here. It's interesting but, in my opinion, Bronson can't compare withValhalla Rising, the director's masterpiece. Already forgotten, unfortunately."
2,Wha- huh? Why? Why was this made?,"I heard abut this movie and about how good it was, so I rented it, and although Tom Hardy does a great job playing a sociopath... I still don't understand why this guy has a movie made about him. This is nothing to celebrate or applaud. He stood for nothing and he's spent more of his life in jail than out. Who cares! I'm surprised the guards haven't helped him have a fatal accident. Good acting, but bah-humbug to the movie."
1,worthless,"the country allow a person to run around causing trouble for everyone, when he should been put away after the second incident. It was a waste of time and effort, this man life could been wrote in six pages or less, for he did the same thing over and over again, going to jail."
3,This movie was annoying,"Yeah, this movie had it's good parts, but for the most part was annoying. Then again people tell me that Clockwork Orange and Requiem For A Dream are amazing, and I think those movies should be forgotten for all time, as they were terrible."
2,not much to enjoy,"I saw no character development.The flick just throws you to the wolves to be devoured of any sanity.I don't watch much, but the first 30 minutes were all I could take. If you have the patience this might be interesting."
2,Artsy with no message or entertainment value,"Despite some excellent acting, it just was not entertaining, enlightening, educational, or challenging. I can't say I hated it, as I had zero reaction to it at all."
2,Poor quality presentation,"I did not enjoy the video because of the poor, and to my preception, strange presentation. Perhaps that was intended to get across the character of the man and the situations."
4,Ok movie,"Worth watching one time. I dont think I could tolerate the music again, and the ending just left you hanging. Also would have been nice to see pictures of the real Bronson at the end."
2,Not my cup of tea,"This movie missed the mark IMHO. There should have been more back-story psychologically to be able to flesh out this otherwise sociopathic, egomaniacal jerk. I found it unrelentingly violent and disturbing."
5,Fantastic movie,"What a brilliant movie and an amazing performance by Tom Hardy. If you're thinking about buying this don't hesitate, you'll be glad you did. Highly recommended"
1,Don't waste your time,"This movie was so dull and boring, I can't began to explain how slow paced and out there, this movie was."
3,over the top,"clockwork orange meets prison. a bit violent with not too much of a story arc, but maybe I just wasn't in the mood for a movie about a guy whose story I struggle to associate with."
1,Lame,WTH I just wasted my time on that??? Awful story don't get the point of making a movie about this guy. It's stupid.
2,Slow & lethargic,"Interesting, but moved so slowly and with no apparent sense of direction. Bronson's story is interesting and I think Hardy did a fair job of acting, but it seems the writing was weak and the directing not much better."
4,totally bizarre,This is positively the strangest movie I've seen I think in my entire life. It's basically a prison movie on acid and makes A Clockwork Orange look like an episode of Friends. It's stylishly filmed and Tom Hardy is fantastic but so so strange.
2,Strange waste of time,"Weird film about a weird man. Great acting, great show. Utterly ruined by the fact that a moral viewpoint is totally lacking. A triumph of modern moral relativism. This makes the film pointless and a complete waste of time. I was bored out of my wits."
2,disappointing,I was very excited to get this movie. I was very disappointed when I watched it. It pretty much sucked.
1,blu ray quality,"Let me clear the air by saying I don't agree that this movies story was 5 or 4 star for that matter. I made the mistake of not waiting for more reviewers or opinions. Without going into details I have to say this movie was boring and so predictable. What prompted me to drop the review to one star is the quality of the DVD on Blu-ray. If you going to buy this movie please rent it first! If your expecting HD quality buy the regular DVD, its the same quality as the blu-ray. I have both top of the lines Panny 1080p 50"" and a blu-ray player with HDMI connections. I have 50 blu-ray movies and about 400 standard DVD movies and this by far is one of the worst pictures I have ever seen. Please rent this one before you buy it and save your money. If your a movie buff like I am I hope this helped!"
1,Classic Vince Gill,All one would expect from vince gill! Enjoyed listening to the great hits by this classic country and western artist.
5,Good country music,I bought this cd for a friend that loves country music and Vince Gill. she cooks better when she is listening to him.
2,Excellent book marred by slander,"As many reviewers have commented, Prof. Lopez does an excellent job deconstructing the many fantasies Westerners entertain about Tibet. I was very dismayed, however, by his sneering dismissal of the work of Trungpa Rinpoche and Sogyal Rinpoche, who he declares are not ""real Tibetans"" because they dared to try to present a difficult terma text in a manner that they believed would resonate with Westerners. While Trungpa Rinpoche did often present the dharma in psychological terms, he consistently affirmed the conventional Tibetan understanding of the six realms and other teachings. Surely Prof. Lopez is aware of the years of vigorous traditional monastic training Rinpoche underwent as a tulku in pre-invasion Tibet, as a result of which he received both the Khenpo degree. For Prof. Lopez to think that he is in a position to weigh in on the validity of the teaching choices made by these two lamas strikes me as quite arrogant and presumptuous."
2,Too 'ivory tower' for me,"This book is written in an extremely scholastic style. I did find the last few chapters interesting, but most of the book seemed to drone on and on about minor details which didn't seem to me to be THAT relevant to the main theme of 'buddhism and the west'. Come now, did we really need a whole chapter on Lobsang Rampa? I would be more interested to know how average western buddhist practitioners view and practice their religion, and how this contrasts with the east."
4,The Idealization of Tibet,"I am a scholar, not of Tibetan Buddhism, but of North American death and dying literature. Lopez' book is a marvelous change from the mushy-romantic ""Noble Exotic"" vision of Tibet that emerges in the literature written for popular consumption on ""Tibetan Book of the Dead"" and related topics. As other traditionally Buddhist countries became heavily industrialized - particularly Japan - they became un-idealizable, while Tibet has been given that role and continues to hold onto it. Lopez's book is a corrective, accessible to non-specialists, and raises important questions about how and why we construct ""Shangri-La."""
3,Not the best...,"This game is ok for maybe a beginning tennis players but for all the advanced players, it's kind of a bore. If you are a beginning tennis player that has just started playing tennis, or doesn't know how to play at all, this game will be awesome for you. But if you're a more advanced tennis player, like me, this game doesn't have enough advanced moves or anything."
4,Nice decent product,This is a nice solid stero micing adapter. Very strong and doesn't slip up. What is missing are measuring markers indicating the angle in which the mics are set to. This would eliminate the need to use a protractor to set the angles.
3,In my small hallway it worked,"I purchased this for my hallway, and it fit great...giving it a 3 only because it didn't come in the finish I needed."
3,End table fills a purpose.,"Please note that this;along with so many things,was made in China. The have little if no control over quality of their products. This table was very easy to assembly.You just had to screw on the legs. The problem was that they drilled several holes and you had to choose the correct one. Please note,this is not wood.It is pressed material with a covering.It does look nice at a distant but do not expect it to last for years.It is not something you would hand-down to a family member unless they are just starting out with disposable furniture."
3,From Back Cover,"After a whirlwind courtship Sheikh Hakim bin Omar al Kadar proposes marriage. There are no declarations of love, but shy, innocent Catherine Benning has already fallen head-over-heels in love and she accepts... After their wedding day - and night, when the sheikh claims his virgin wife - Catherine and Hakim travel to his desert kingdom. Catherine discovers that this is no love match for Hakim - he's bought her![From the Surrender to the Sheikh series]"
4,Bought by the sheikh...,"After a whirlwind curtship, Sheikh Hakim bin Omar al Kadar propses marriage. Shy, innocent Catherine Benning has already fallen head-over-heels in love and she accepts...After their wedding day - and night - when the sheikh claims his virgin wife, Catherine and Hakim travel to his desert kingdom. there Catherine discovers that this is no love match for Hakim - he's bought her.Review: This is a sweet story with well drawn out characters. The heroine's father secretly arranges their courtship, but it's clear the hero quickly begins to care for the heroine in her own right."
2,Disappointed,"I am a HUGE fan of this season. The DVD, however, fails to show the best scenes. It follows the cast from the beginning try outs but ends before all of the drama really started. None of the fights are included on this DVD, it doesn't include the recording sessions. I was very disappointed because it's marketed as if it includes the entire season."
5,Amazing!,Amelia Kinkade's abilities are nothing short of miraculous. I thank her for sharing her gift with readers and helping us all to become more responsible pet parents and make us more aware of how precious are animal friends are.
5,animal communication at its easiest,"This book is well written, concise, easy to follow, a good guide for anyone who wants a better understanding of how animals and people can and do communicate."
