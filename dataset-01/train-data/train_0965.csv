1,"Flawed design, failed after 3 months","I'd give this product 4 stars since when its working it's great and pretty powerful, however this vacuum should not be on the market as it is a flawed design. There was a recall on the previous model, which I found out too late & discovered Hoover has not corrected the issues with this vacuum. The connections between the hose and handle begin to fail and the motor started cutting out. I could go on but see many other reviews with similar problems. Fortunately I'm close to a very good vacuum shop (Banks in Troy, MI) who were very nice and helpful in servicing and repairing the vacuum however I'm concerned how long it will keep working until it quits again and if there will be warranty left by then."
2,Electrical Connection keeps shutting off,"This vacuum worked great for a few months. Then just last month the electrical system sounds like it is going. It will turn on at times then off. I'm very disappointed in the quality for the price I paid. I was under the assumption that there is a one year warranty on this product, therefore I believe it should be replaced as I purchased in May 2012 and haven't even had it a year. Would like to be reimbursed or receive a new vacuum."
2,It was ok. Picked up real well for about a year,Then we moved on to a Dyson and even used it is better than this. But I suppose if you like dragging the rest of the vacuum behind you all the time you may enjoy this one
1,DON'T BUY this vacuum,"After seeing a glowing review from Consumer Reports, and many reviews at Amazon I decided to buy this one. Some of the reviews dating several years back complained of reliability issues, especially with a power switch going bad. I thought this is a simple fix for the company, and the issue should have already been resolved after so many incidents. Well, it's only been a little over 2 years of light use (once every other week), and the vacuum died. Yes, it's the power switch. What's more, Hoover would not stand behind the product when I contacted customer service. I would strongly advise steering away from all Hoover products, especially this one."
2,"OK, but needs some work!","The suction on this vacuum is unbeatable. I also like the cord length and the handle attached to the top of the cannister. The things I find remiss are: 1) the weight...I find myself preparing to lift it with a mighty heave each time I have to move it; 2) the size of the dust collector...it's very small and seems to need emptying several times during my cleaning; 3) the upholstery attachment...doesn't seem to do the best job; 4) the filter cleaning... a real annoyance because you have to use the provided brush on every fold of the filter; and 5) the wand...it's unwieldy and difficult to move especially whenit's on the highest suction level. Given a second opportunity, I don't think I would purchase this vacuum again."
4,"Powerful vaccum, doesn't last too long","I had much doubt about this vacuum before ordering it. I've had it now for two weeks and I'm glad I got it. Its suction power is great. I was especially surprised at how well it cleaned the carpet. The suction is so powerful that I have a hard time pulling it back. The attachments are very handy. The only part I don't care much about is having to clean out the canister....otherwise, overall a good vacuum.10/19/2011Since my raving review of last, this vacuum as great as it broke. I vacuum once a week, approximately 500 sq. ft. of carpet and 600 sq. ft. of bare floor. There must be connection problem, as the head does not work when I tilt to vacuum. I'm sorry to see that it broke so soon."
3,Wind tunnel vacuum,"The vacuum does a superb job of cleaning....it has more than enough suction and I like the adjustable setting for suction. I have only three complaints...it is difficult to maneuver, the canister has to be emptied very often and it is heavy. On the plus side, my son recently visited and asked if we had new carpeting...Over all I am pleased with my purchase."
2,It stinks,"This vacuum has great suction, but cleaning the filter and the cup are a big pain. I have a dog and every time I vacuum I have to open the windows and air out the house because it stinks. I can't find a replacement filter, so I wash it with vinegar, rinse with water and set it in the sun to dry. My husband hates it and wants to buy a different vacuum, but I don't want to give up the suction. If you have pets, I'd avoid it."
1,Too heavy for daily cleaning,This vacuum is too heavy for daily cleaning. I won't recommend it for anyone.
3,Great suction-expensive parts,"Love the suction of this vacuum; however, I've had it for three years using it every other day and now i have to replace the hose due to it having a hole where it inserts into the plastic piece that inserts into the canister. This is quite a pricey part and I am currently wondering if I should spend a few extra bucks and just get a brand new vacuum (yes, the part is that pricey). Other than that, I have put it through a lot as I have a BIG house and a large dog as well as a cat and feel it has done well."
1,Disappointed,"Like many other customers I purchased this vacuum because it received a good rating from Consumer Reports. I have had the machine only a few months, and although it does a good job of picking up dirt, I have encountered similar problems to those of other reviewers. The machine will not always turn off when you press the power button. In order to turn it off, I have to unplug it from the outlet. The plastic pieces that connect the top of the wand to the hose cracked and have since fallen off. The power head no longer stays connected to the wand. In order to be able to vacuum rugs, I must now duct tape the two pieces together."
3,"Love this vacuum, BUT the belt slips off too easily","I love everything about this vacuum except for one very important part, the rotator brush for carpets. I specifically purchased this vacuum for all of it's great qualities including the large rotator head attachment. From the first day I have had to deal w/many screws just to take the head apart to re-attach the belt. I might have expected this to happen over a certain amount of months or years but not from the start. I am not prepared to start investing in new belts and deal w/other possible issues involving replacement parts after just 2-3 weeks of use so I cannot keep or recommend this vacuum cleaner."
2,Not Too Great,"Great suction. But it is poorly put together. I use this vacuum everyday. After a week, the electrical connection on the pole started slipping upward, making it stop working after going back-and-forth about 10 times. The only way to rectify the problem was to duct tape it so it couldn't wiggle loose. I feel this should not have happened so quickly after purchasing it."
1,The worst vacuum I ever owned and the worst cusomer service,"I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this vac. I used it 4 times and it broke. I have a studio apartment so it did not get heavy use. I called the company, they do not have a toll free telephone number so you have to pay high toll calls and wait on line forever. There is no company repair store in my area. I would have had to ship it elsewhere for service. Hoover is not the company they used to be 30 years ago and their service is non-existent. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
2,"Great, while it worked.","Purchased this from Amazon. It worked great, cleaned carpets and hard floors. Was easy to handle. Powerful. Nice air filter. We really liked it. For 2 years.Then it completely broke down. Power nozzle quit working. Cord shorted out. Cost more to fix than to buy a new one.I don't expect today's plastic vacuums to last forever, like the Electrolux that we had when I was growing up. But 2 years until it is totally shot is ridiculous."
4,works great,I have had no problems with the product. The suction is great and I enjoy the fact that I can go from carpet to hardwood with the touch of a button.
4,Pleased with my purchase,"This vacuum cleaner does a great job cleaning the hardwood floors, and a FANTASTIC job getting all the pet hair off upholstery. I was concerned that it might be noisy but as soon as I turned it on and began using it, those fears slipped away. There is a way to increase the suction of the vacuum, and when you increase suction it does get a little louder, but it is nothing like other upright vacuums I've had previously. As others have stated, the collection source needs to be emptied often, especially if you are getting up pet hair. But that's a small price to pay for a job well done. I would definitely recommend this product, great buy for the $$."
3,so so service,"Overall we really liked the vac but we encountered a problem with the belt slipping the 2nd time we used it. I called Hoover Svc 800 number and was told they would send out free pack of belts and we should give those a try. I agreed that would be a good place to start but was not happy to here that even though its under factory warranty ( two days old ) Hoover service centers are all independents and sometimes charge to just look at the vac , should the belt not correct the problem. Just something to keep in mind for potential service problems. They stated any returns for new merchandise would have to be addressed with Amazon. The new belt seems to have corrected the problem for now. We will keep our fingers crossed as we really do like this vac."
4,I named it OBI!!,"I really love my little Canister. It follows me around making little noises like a Robot! Everything is easier to do, changing the height of wand, taking in the cord, changing from hard floor to carpet, adjusts to depth of rugs and carpets, controls are in the handle, has a light for under furniture and beds. The only thing I am sorry about is the duster. .and lack of a good brush. But I can manage that otherwise.To control the suction so easily at the handle is wonderful!! AND, no more dusty, torn, messy bags to buy or empty. I really am glad I made this purchase and I truly saved $100.00 at Amazon.com"
5,Power,"This little vacuum has a load of power. When I first used it I felt it was pushing and pulling me around instead of me doing it. It really does a nice job, and is a great cleaner for the cost. I love it."
4,Hoover Windtunnel Really Sucks!,"It's the best vacuum I've ever used. Not so great for small area rugs, but I love it. Even more-so than the very expensive Meila I used to have. Emptying the garbage out of the bagless cup can be a little messy, but the cleaning ability is fabulous!"
2,vac good customer service stinks,"did not receive the hand held attachment with this vac, so i was told by amazon to contact hoover directly. i was hung up on over 5 times. spoke to know one who spoke english with any fluency. will never buy a hoover again because of their poo.r customer service. We need to let companys know its not OK to outsource jobs to other countries....it takes jobs away from us and makes doing business witht these companies much harder on us...the consumer."
1,Don't be fooled!,"When I received my new vacuum, I loved it. Well, needless to say, it didn't last very long. I have mostly hard wood floors, no pets or children. My vacuum is not used often or abused. Exactly one year to date the motor burnt out. The warranty is useless and ""Hoover"", unknown to me, is made in China and the quality has gone way down. Beware and check where your product is being manufactured. It is quite unfortuante that I bought it because of the respected name."
1,Total POS,"Ordered it on March 1. As of April 11, it's hot working. Smells like smoke when it is run. When I took off the filter to investigate, I see sparks shooting out of the sides. No suction. What's best is that Hoovers website is down so I can't contact them to find out what's wrong.EDIT:The unit was covered under warranty and was fixed. Vacuum has been working fine, but the dust bin does fill up fast and I need to blow out the filter with my air compressor, but since I already have the compressor it's no big deal. Very powerful suction."
4,Hoover Canister Vacuum,Works great. Little heavy for me but I am going to build up some muscle using the unit. The only thing I wasn't happy with was the tiny dirt cup. I guess all the filters just took up too much room.
4,Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Bagless Canister Vac,We are very pleased with the sweeper in general. Only 2 flaws. You have to dump the canister often and the electric cord is a bit short.
1,New vacuum overheated :(,"I bought this vacuum new and it overheated within 10 minutes of using it for the first time. It would cool off, start working, and stop within 5-10 minutes again. I read a lot of good things about it so was extremely disappointed. In all honesty, it might not have been a great choice for our family anyway because I vacuum about every 2 days, and I have 5 kids, so the very small canister would have needed emptying constantly. The size of this vacuum would probably make it a better choice for someone with a small apartment who vacuums once a week. One more thing is that the small brush attachment has very stiff bristles so dusting wide baseboards with it was quite difficult. I would keep looking. I purchased a kenmore canister from Sears instead, along with a 2 yr service warranty, and it has been great in every way. I don't have stairs so even though it is heavy, this isn't an issue with me."
2,requires too much maintenance,Cleans good but the tiny dirt compartment needs dumping after 10 minutes of vacuuming and the filter needs cleaning every 3-4 times you use the machine. Cleaning the filter is a big messy job that takes about 30 minutes to do properly.I wish i would have purchased one with a bag!!!update: died after one year of weekly use.
4,great vacuum,Great price great product. Only gripe is made in China - but what isn't? I would recommend this any day.
2,Unhappy and upset,"I am really upset with this vacuum. The first time I used it the belt came off and the carpet vacuum would not work. I had to go find a vacuum dealer who sold this type of belt. I was then told that Hoover is no longer in business (probably why this vacuum was on sale). Had I known this I would never have purchased this vacuum. The second time I used the vacuum, the same thing happened, the belt came off AGAIN! If you plan to purchase this vacuum, be sure to have plenty of belts available. I bought three. I would not recommend this vacuum to anyone."
1,Junk,This vacuum is garbage. Do not buy it. Just trying to save anyone who reads this some headaches. Nuff said.
3,"works well, but noisy","This vac works well, but after a few uses the front part started making creaky noises whenever it is moved around. It's a bit bothersome."
1,fair,"received with 4 componet parts missing. 3 could be sent asap, other would have to be back ordered.not acceptable for new closed box purchase."
5,buy this vac,"I bought this vacuum as a ""touch up"", in between the cleaning crew, vacuum. I have Kirbys and Hoovers and Kenmores. This little thing out performs them all. I was not expecting such performance. I have only had it for a week so I cannot speak on long term satisfaction but I can say my expectations were very much surpassed."
1,Garbage,"This vacuum is pure garbage! The beater bar won't work unless the rear wheels are held up...Half the time the control buttons don't work. I took it apart to check it and now it works if I keep the screws out. When it works, it does work, but you have to empty the canister way too often.My opinion, don't waste your money. I turely hate this vacuum!I wish someone still sold the Fantum Lightning Canister Vacuum. I loved that one!"
5,Great Hoover,"I am embarrassed to say that I had no idea how dirty my carpets were....I have been using a Hoover canister vacuum for many, many years, until one day it simply died. When I purchased this new Hoover, I realized my old vacuum hadn't been doing much of a job for quite some time. This bagless model is wonderful...it really, REALLY cleans..the wide attachment for wood floors covers a large area so quickly and gets under all the furniture. The attachment for carpets works very well. I wish the dirt cup were a little larger, but other than that, I have no complaints. After washing the filter and waiting for it to dry before I could use it again, I decided to purchase a second filter. I highly recommend it and it had a very good review in Consumer Report magazine."
5,Great vacuum for small apartment,"I was looking for a small vacumm for my one bedroom apartment in the mid-west and after doing a lot of research, I purchased this one. It's working out great. I didn't realize my carpets were so dirty until I used it and saw what was in the dirt canister. It seems to have really good suction with both the powered carpet brush and the hard surface attachment. At my other home, which is a small condo out west, I have had a Dyson Canister Vacuum for about four years which I like very much. This vacumm works as well if not better for a lot less money. The only other difference is the Hoover needs a little more room than the Dyson to store it."
5,Great Vac at any price....,"I have owned several vacuums during the past 25 years some were better than others, but only one ever came close to this one (and it cost substantially more money) Light weight, easy to manuever powerful little vac loaded with options and accessories. Before making the purchace I did my homework and checked out a lot of vacuums in the $200 - $300 range and this one had the best mix of features vs cost. You can imagine how happy I was to find it here at Amazon for a much lower price than advertised elsewhere.I knew a Hoover would never let me down, I have everything I want in a compact canister vac, including HEPA filtering without the costly Hepa replacement cartridges and bagless convenience! Thanks Hoover and thank you Amazon!"
2,Vac is great - Customer Service really sucks....,"This vac only lasted for 3 months! It cleaned great and was easy to use until the powered floor nozzle quit working after 3 months. The Hoover company would not answer my emails, when I called I got a customer service person in another contry that I could not understand and didn't understand me or what my problem was.I called two more times and was given the names of service centers that were all over 100 miles from my home and told I had to take it to one of them. I have never had as bad an experience or been so dissatisfied with any company as I have with Hoover. I will never buy one of their products again no matter how good it might be."
4,Recent Purchase,"I switched from an upright to the Hoover Canister. Takes some getting used to moving the unit & hose around. The vacuum has excellent power, expels clean air, & is quiet. Only real drawback so far is the size of the canister but it is very easy to empty. Would recommend this vacuum to friends."
5,"A Great Vacuum, So Far.","I bought this vacuum to replace my 15 year old vacuum that was exceeding expensive and supposed to last a lifetime. At the time of that purchase, it was the Mercedes Benz of vacuums, ranked second behind a Swedish vacuum that I'd never heard of or seen.The Hoover works everybit as well as my other vacuum did, perhaps with better suction. It doesn't require expensive bags, it's easy to manipulate, and it is compact enough to store in my pantry closet, close to where I make all of the messes.The real test will come over time to see how reliable it is. But at the price I paid, I could replace it about every three years and get more mileage from it than my ""Mercedes Benz of vacuums."""
4,A good quality for the buck!,"It is a good vacuum cleaner. I am so happy to be back to using a canister one: it is so much more convinient in the staircase, easy to manoeuver (especially under furniture) and as efficient as an upright. It is also great for use in the car.My only complaint about this model is what a lot of other people noticed too. The dust canister is small and if you have a lot of carpet it will need to be emptied every couple of rooms. That part can get messy (although easy to do). The filter is better off cleaned outside and it can take a while to do so.Over all, I am happy with this purchase which comes at an unbeatable price and was praised by Consummer Report."
2,Powerful but flimsy,"It's true it's powerful and pulls up the fine dust. But everyone who describes the flimsy handle is right. One week after receiving this, after using it only a few times, the handle will now not stay in the upright resting position when inserted in the main, large vacuum head attachment. Which means it has to be laid down horizontally on the floor everytime I let go of it. And the control button panel on the handle is so flimsy and cheap it's like something on a childs toy. I agree with the person who said this vacuum will last her about a year, but not longer than that. If you, like me, would prefer to have a better built vacuum that lasts longer after paying $200 including shipping, then get something else. The industrial designer who designed this at Hoover earns an ""F"". They really need to test these things with real people in real homes, before putting them on the market."
2,It works fine while it works,I have the vacuum just over a year. It starts to falling apart. The power switch does not work any more so it is useless now.
2,Love it/hate it:(,"I bought one of these because I loved the reviews and it was important to me to buy an American Made product. Hoover is one of few affordable USA companies. I love the little thing...when it runs. Great suction, easy to use, but the beater bar shuts off randomly (seems to be a short in a wire, perhaps). Also, when it does run, the belt keeps running itself off the bar. So frustrating. Back to the drawing board..."
2,Worked good ......for about 8 moths :(,"I bought this about 8 months ago and it has been working fine until sparks started flying out of the motor and it had no suction.A brush that is used in the motor broke and was causing the sparks. Looked into buying the part (VERY CHEAP BY THE WAY) but you cannot buy the part, you have to buy a whole new motor which would be about $100 plus shipping!Will not buy another Hoover as long as they make them so cheap!"
1,CR Reports this as a best buy NOT,Constantly clogs filter and difficult to clean. Poor suction after first month. Poorly designed parts that fit too loosely that allow loss of suction.
4,Cannister type Hoover wind tunnel vacuum cleaner.,I have used it twice and I am very impressed with the suction. It is easy to use and maneuver. It is amazing how quickly the dust cannister fills up so it has to be doing an effective cleaning job. It is a quick pic by Consumer Reports.
5,LOVE IT!,"Love this vacuum. This is the first cannister vacuum that I have owned. I wasn't leaning towards getting the cannister style, but after reading many reviews decided that this was the route go because we have mostly hardwood floors with some carpeting. SO glad I did - this vacuum works wonderfully on both floor types. Couldn't be happier!"
5,Awesome vacuum,"I absolutely love this vacuum. I have always had a Hoover upright vacuum and the latest one we own, did not pick up much of anything on my floors. We got new carpet in our bedroom last year and finally am now able to clean it properly with this new vacuum. The only thing I have to say negative about it is that the canister is small and needs to be emptied quite often, especially with pets. But overall, I love it. The power it generates is wonderful. Amazon's price is a great price also!"
4,"Powerful Vacuum, but heavy","This is a great vacuum if you are looking for power. I previously had a canister vacuum and had tried and returned several uprights before buying this one. The suction power is excellent, and the Hepa filter is easy to clean. If you are looking for a small vacuum, this one is not for you as the width is pretty wide and will not fit under some furniture unless you switch to the attachments. The parts are quite durable and well-made, which however also results in them being quite heavy. All in all I am very happy with it except for the bulkiness and awkwardness of moving around. Be careful when moving around the canister so as not to dent your furniture. Love the retractable cord!"
2,"Good, while it lasted (which was not too long)","This vacuum worked well initially, but then the hose got clogged with junk. We cleaned it out, and it started working well again. Unfortunately now it has died out completely...the one year warranty expired about two months ago!!! Next time, I will buy the extended warranty. This is the third Hoover I've had problems with. They all have lasted just past the one year!!! We have no pets or such, so I guess it's just bad luck. No more Hoovers for our family."
3,Could be designed better,"Good suction as long as you empty the collection chamber and clean the filter after EVERY use, or for full suction, 1/2 way through an area. One area = 500 sq ft.The buttons only work if I lift the hose up on the canister end after the unit is on. It has a short in the wiring running the length of the hose somewhere.The hose is too short. If it was 2-3 feet longer the unit would be more convenient."
1,"SUCKS, and not in a good way","I bought this vac based on all the 5 star amazon reviews. Big mistake. I've had it about 2 months and it has already gone through 3 belts, the tool cover broke off and it's been in the shop more than I have used it. Read the bad reviews as well as the good one."
1,Poor design; multiple failures in first 12 months.,"In the first month, the yellow collar holding the filter broke. The unit works without it, however. The contraptions holding the powerbar to the wand allows hair and debris to become trapped, causing the powerbar to slip off until you wrench the spring back and clean out the debris. Objects become lodged in the bend of the handle and cannot be reached with standard household implements (I used a 14"" surgical tool). The slide switch failed twice and now the vacuum appears dead altogether. I give up. I won't even mention how much I disliked cleaning the dirt trap and drying filter, only to have it mildew in the Florida humidity, because that was a given, I suppose. No more Hoovers for me."
1,Hoover Windtunnel Electric Bagless Canister Vacuum,"A fundamentally defective machine. I am an independent housekeeper who was drawn to this vacuum for its features: portable, bagless HEPA filter, with great range of attachments including a vibrating carpet attachment. However, after experiencing the same problem with the connections on THREE Windtunnels (the buttons stopped working, the connection at the handle and at the base of the hose all stopped working--within two months of purchase with one model)I have decided never to buy another."
2,No Height Adjustment,"I've had this vacuum for over one year and the roller brush has never worked correctly. The brush would only turn when I pushed the head forward. From reading many reviews today I see that I'm not the only one having this problem. I have berber carpet and the roller will only turn when on tile. After spending quite some time trying to fix the problem, finally the roller brush spins continuously like it should have from day one. With no height adjustment available, the WHEELS WERE TAKEN OFF the head attachment. Now it works."
5,everyone vacuums now!,"Lightweight, user friendly, easy to clean. Canister needs emptying almost every time it's used (I have 2 cats one with long hair). However, that also means I don't overfill the canister and it's ready to use the next time! Price was better than in the local stores (ie Dallas) and other reviews rated this machine as a good product, which we agree. Windtunnels are were highly rated."
4,Wouldnt buy another.....,"I just moved to Vegas. When I lived at home with my parents, my brother and I bought this vacuum for my mother because she needed a new one. At first, we were very skeptical that this was not going to suck good on the different carpets we had and MAN IT DOES!!! I have a cat here in my apartment, and this Vacuum even picks up the little things that get embedded in the carpet! When I first moved here i bought a $100 vacuum from walmart, but donated that and purchased this! I would highly recommend this vacuum!!!! ( for small spaces, my apartment, and large spaces, my parents house)"
2,Disappointed in this vacuum,"After reading the great reviews, I thought I'd give this vacuum a try. I am disappointed in this vacuum. The control buttons on the vacuum work only about 50% of the time. I have to unplug the vacuum to turn it off. I do like that it has great suction and I love the cord rewind. It has an awkward feel, and it feels like a chore to pull it out and use it. I will probably get rid of this vacuum and purchase another Eureka ""The Boss""."
3,Kim in Dallas,"This little vacuum has amazing power, when it worked. I've only had it for one month and the attachment brush won't turn. The unit has suction and the belt is fine. It seems like it's either the motor or the power buttons. Stay tuned, I'm going to take it to Hoover to see if I can get it fixed or replaced. This should not happen to a new product - not sure I would highly recommend it."
5,hover vacuum s3765-040,THIS IS THE BEST VACUUM I HAVE USED IN THE LAST 37 YEARS..AND I HAVE HAD THE BEST FROM KIRBY TO ELECTROLUX...THIS ONE TOP THEM ALL AND IT IS VERY USER FRIENDLY..I REALLY LIKE THE WAY IT IS SELF PROPELLED ON THE CARPETING..THIS IS REALLY A GREAT ITEM.
3,Buy Another,"I just recieved the hoover bagless vacuum and I am very disappointed, my wheels squeek already(started after 1 week) and the bagless tank holds very little dirt so it must be cleaned after every use. It also gets away from you, so you have very little control over the vacum while on carpet. My suggestion get a different vacuum."
1,Great Intentions,Got ProductWorked Great (For a Week)Went to Repair Center (Bad service from them and poor Communication)Still No Vacuum!Only owned it for about a week before it stopped working. Not getting very good service from Hoovers or Certified Repair Center. Still don't have it 4 weeks later and it is going to be 2 more weeks minimum once somebody at Hoover finally communicated with me about it.I can only recommend... BUY SOMETHING ELSE... Based on this experience.
1,Dead at age one and a half,"I was so happy with this product until last week. The suction power is awesome, the dirt tank is a little small, but over all, I was quite content. In fact I was just about to review this vacuum and rate it 5 stars until the controls quit working. I bought this vacuum in March of 2010. 200 and some dollars and it lasted 18 months. I looked into fixing it but the entire hose piece would need to be replaced to the tune of 130.00! The vacuum repair person I spoke with said that Hoover USED to be a good brand of vacuum until they were bought/merged with Dirt Devil and now these vacuums are made in Mexico and the quality has plummeted. Save your money and invest in a better brand. This unit is just a jilting lover."
3,Hoover wind tunnel purchase,"I find it bulky and hard to drag around, probably a better vacuum for carpet...I have mostly bare floors. The receptacle has to be emptied every time."
3,beware Hoover customer service,"i purchased my unit in mid 2010 and it has had a problem..which isn't a big deal but the way that Hoover has dealt with this has shocked me. i've never had such poor customers service...in terms of I have not received even 1 response to repeated request. i've been waiting for a new part going on 3 months now with NO visibility into when it might arrive. very disappointed, but have absolutely no leverage in the transaction so i must wait..very frustrating.."
5,great buy,This was a great buy. very reasonable for the quality. Easy to use. I had an upright and it was just too heavy for me to push around. Canister style is so much easier to use on stairs (has a little attachment for the stairs) and under furniture. Easy to get wand off of the motorized floor brush part. Canisters I had in the past were hard to get apart. This vacuum works great on bare floors as well as on carpet. highly recommend. I almost bought a much more expensive (more than 2x the price of this one) brand until I read the reviews on this product.
3,It's OK,"This vacuum is excellent for small rooms, but if you have a lot of spaces to clean get ready to clean the filter more than once each time. It is silence compare to our old vacuum, but don't expect to carry out a conversion while vacuuming. I like the fact that all controls are built right on the handle, e.g. off, on, floor or carpet option button, etc. You can go from carpet to hard floor with ease.I didn't expect the filter to be as small as it is, I guess pictures are deceiving, but it's easy to clean. If you want to prevent dust from getting deep inside the filter canister's grooves you can wrap a cloth around the filter. Make sure not to use heavy cloth because it might prevent airflow through the filter. Dryer sheets like Bounce work great as they can allow excellent air flow and add a scent to the room."
4,Less is more,"This is a wonderful product and love the unique flavor. I could use some more ideas about how to use it. I have learned that less is more,it only takes a tiny pinch."
3,Started very well,"The interviews with various Advaita teachers were very interesting and revealing. The book began with a series of live, vital interviews for the first 11 chapters, with some brilliant interviews, especially with Catherine Ingram, Pamela Wilson, Francis Lucille and Satyananda. After that the interviews seemed ""canned"" and the answers less vital or compelling.There are some inaccuracies in the book. For example,the author implied a direct lineage from Ramana Maharshi through Papaji to Gangaji. This is not correct as Ramana Maharshi did not appoint anyone to carry on his teaching, and specifically stated that he would not. Ramana Maharshi left no lineage for anyone to ""receive"", or ""pass on"".Excellent quotes were used at the end of chapters from, among others, Ramana Maharshi, Nisargadatta Maharaj, and J Krishnamurti."
2,Confusing description,"I purchased this book to use with a college class thinking it was a complete student kit. It is NOT - it is just the book. I am sure the text is fine, but I rated it with 2 stars for the confusion. This is only my first disappointment with Amazon - their delivery and service has been great other than this."
5,Fast and correct,"I was a little concerned about the model being correct, all I could find was 1801, but it seems that is all peavey ever did with an 18 and it is pretty great"
1,Expensive,"My school had the 8th edition listed for this semester up until about a week ago then changed it to 10th. (After I bought the 8th of course.) $5 for the 8th, $100 for this. Very upset, unexpected expense. Really how much new info and breakthroughs in running a small business effectively have there been in the past 7 years for there to be not one but two rewrites. They really like to abuse and price gouge the school system."
3,Have Your Instructor Standing By,"This is a great book if your just getting into business, however if you already know the basics you may want to try something a little deeper. There are quite a few questions this book just won't answer so make sure you go to class. As a supplement to in class lectures and hands on study you will be able to gain alot from reading this text. It offers alot of valuable information in an easy to understand format. I hope you like reading though because it tends to get a little dry."
1,PS3 controller battery change,"The battery itself is OK, but replacement is terrible, practically difficult. Controller PS3 shows cheap and poor design.Why this controller enclosure do not allow the user to open a back door and replace the battery? Once I open it, all tiny parts fall apart ?. The battery is holding by piece of foam, instead of formed plastic edges as a firm compartment. Hard to align the battery in order to close properly the back cover for controller.I do not recommend to open and replace the battery inside of PS3 siz axis controller !"
3,like/dislike,"I like this product very much but the price $8.50 is a tad high, but what is worse is that the S&H; is also $8.50.Won't be ordering this anymore. Double cost. Forget it!"
2,"If you have fine hair, skip this!","I went by the reviews and decided to buy this product. If you have fine hair, try something else; it will make your hair go limp. The shine is not even that great. Booooo."
5,A great adjective book for your children,"I remember reading this book when I was a kid. So many memories. The artwork is gorgeous, and the lessons are very memorable. If you want to teach your kids how to use adjectives in a fun, creative way. This is one book that will help. :)"
1,Did NOT like movie!,"This series was very slow, very poor acting - just didn't like move - very disappointed to buy Pray 1, Pray 2 and Pray 2.5 only to find out Pray 2.5 has all on one disk."
2,You can tell it's their first attempt at making a movie,"What can you say... may be a decent story line, but too many faults to actually want to follow through and watch it.Sounds is terrible - and night time shooting is terrible. Even I know to shoot during the day and put a filter on so it looks like night."
2,Quality control lacking,"This product was defective when I received it. The holes drilled in the fan blades were too big for the screws which attach the blades to the brackets. The company's solution was to send me rubber ""grommets"" to fit in the fan blade holes to make them smaller. Unfortunately the grommets are too big for the holes and I cannot insert them. I have yet to be able to assemble the fan completely, although the motor looks attractive on the ceiling without the fan blades (not)! The problem has yet to be resolved. Anyway, what would happen in five years when the rubber grommets deteriorate and the screws pull loose sending the fan blades flying?"
4,"Hunter Fan 23806 42"" White Low Profile Ceiling Fan",This is a great fan... There is an area for optional light kit instillation. If you do not hook it up to a 3 way dimmer switch you'll need to chang the pull chain every 5 years. It is very easy to install.
2,You are hereby warned,"I have been very disappointed by this set, which contains many of Schumann's best-known and most attractive piano works. The problem is Kempff who does not deserve his reputation from the evidence here. The worst part is his tendency to bang whenever the music gets into the forte range (not just fortissimo), something which spoils the recordings of Papillons. Even when he manages to avoid this, the interpretations are dull and uninteresting. A 4-CD set represents a substantial investment. Go elsewhere."
1,To be avoided,"Despite his reputation as one of the towering exponents of the 19th Germanic repetoire, Kempff acquits himself poorly in these recordings, made at the end of his life. Whether these weak performances are due to his advanced age or to more basic flaws in his training and capabilities is purely academic. They are among the poorest choices in the catalogue, perhaps the very worst. But please - don't take my word for it. Listen to the Et'de IX in the op. 13, on disc 2. Kempff's attempt to pull this off is embarrassingly amateurish; he cannot even cover all the notes at ""presto possibile"", much less raise his playing to something approaching an interpretation. Elsewhere, you can expect the same. The op. 17 is played with little poetry, no finesse and palpable frustration in following Schumann's basic roadmap. You cannot run away from this mess fast enough."
2,still slippery after 16 months,"I am still frustrated by how slippery my mat continues to be after 16 months of regular practice. I have cleaned it, let it set in the sun, cleaned it a different way, let it get sweaty, cleaned it yet another way. It is still slippery when I sweat a bit. I continue to be disappointed. Not worth the $90 I paid, even if it does last a lifetime."
2,DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE SWEATY HANDS OR FEET,"I bought this mat because it had excellent reviews and it is supposed to last a lifetime. At the beginning of my practice it does stick quite well but after only about 5 to 10 minutes my hands and feet have begun sweating and it doesn't stick at all. It was not an exaggeration in the other review that it's like practicing on ice. I have done 6 practices on it and cleaned it twice with no improvement. So, if you're the kind of person that doesn't sweat then this mat will probably be great but if, like me, you sweat quite a bit then you will be better off with a $20 mat you can find at Target."
3,yoga mat,"This seems a durable mat that will last for some time. It has one piece construction so there's no outer layer that can wear or rip. The size is also good, and it's nice to have a little extra length to use though the width is the same as any other mat. The only issue I have is once the mat becomes wet it turns into a slip and slide. The grip is great as long as it's dry, but if it gets damp, you'll need some type of skid-free towel to lay down. Overall, a very good mat- just don't get it wet."
3,SLIP 'N SLIDE,"Slippery when wet......I have now used the manduka mat approx 10 times. I ""scrubbed"" the mat as recommended to reduce the ""break in time"" with respect to slippage. I do ashtanga yoga and everything is soaked by the end of the session. I almost broke my neck last night doing wheel.... I can't believe what I read about this mat being good with Bikram or ashtanga yoga, that is baloney. It may last a life time but I'd rather buy 3 mats for the price of this one mat and not slip everytime it gets a little moisture on it....Pretty disappointed for the money I paid. Absolutely would not buy again....."
5,"A bit heavy, but worth it's weight","The longer mat seems to unroll endlessly and looks like a monster on the floor, but when I get stretched out on it I am not hanging over the end. The density and extra length make the mat a bit heavier than my other mats. I use a mat sack so just sling it over my shoulder anyway.Initially there was an odor, but just hung it out for a few days and that issue is gone. Great mat."
5,great for tall folk,"love love this mat, finally a mat long enough for tall people. I'm 5'9 and it's extra comfy. some say it's slippery the first time using it. you can wear it in by using epsolm salts in the bathtub. I just wash it with the Manduka mat wash and it's good to go."
3,Warning: Slippery when Wet,"Depending who you are (and perhaps more appropriately, how much you sweat), this mat may be the best thing or the worst. On the plus side, this mat is the most durable and stable of any mat I have tried, and I have been doing yoga for many years. Also, the bigger version at 85 inches gives you more room to work than almost any other mat on the market. Once you scrub the mat down with soap and water after you first get it (see other reviews), this mat is also sticky WHEN DRY. However, if you sweat and get the mat wet at all, it becomes VERY slippery. This has really been a problem for more rigorous vinyasa flows. You can buy a sticky towel to put on top of the mat to stop the slipping, but buying a towel for another $45 is hard to stomach after paying almost $100 for this mat. If you sweat, I would highly recommend the Jade yoga mats instead. They remain sticky when wet, but are less durable than the Manduka. Namaste."
4,good mat,"The mat is huge! It's pretty thick, and 85"" is plenty long. Heaviest yoga mat I've ever used. Srsly the extra weight takes a little getting used to.It was quite rubbery smelling and a little slippery when I first got it. I machine washed it in tea tree oil, and have enjoyed the mat ever since. It seems to be holding up well. I'll withhold the final star because based on the cost of the mat, I'm expecting to get some solid use. I want to see how it will hold up. For the most part if you have the extra dollars I recommend this mat."
4,Good mat,"Good mat, excellent length, perfect for me since I'm 6'1"". Durable quality, doesn't slip or slide which is great as well."
4,Great with one flaw,"This mat is the only one that doesn't hurt my knees or spine in happy baby and while rocking on my back. and i'm 6'5"" so the long mat is great. I sweet a lot and this mat even though i washed it, is slick. when i start sweating i start to slip and sometimes it dangerous. But when i don't sweet a ton (standing water in spots on the mat) then the grip is great. Even with the poor grip (when very sweaty) the confort and length makes this a great mat."
3,Average for Plyo Workouts,"I only rate this mat three stars for the cushioning; however, given that I have not tried any other mats this could be the best value. For anyone over 6 feet I would suggest going with the larger mat. On hard surfaces this mat is very stable while doing quick movements; however it does slide some, but not to where I do not feel safe which is why I considered giving a higher rating if it were not for the claim that the mat is slip resistant when wet. I would say the mat does not move very much but your feet/hands may slip if the mat is not dry.In summary the mat is only average for intense plyo workouts, but it does provide a nicer surface to do workouts on (I use for the INSANITY workouts) than bare hard floors."
5,Couldn't be improved,"Glad I ordered it. My feet stick to it, it sticks to the floor, and when you lift your foot, it releases easily while the mat stays put. Never rucks or squeegees, not slippery and its ample size is a true gift. Love. It."
5,Lives up to hype,"I am very new to yoga but have enjoyed the minimal time I've dedicated to this sport to seek out my own mat. I should say that I'm 6'5 so length was a definite need in addition to grip. Well the length did not disappoint - I fit just perfect and am not wishing it was any longer. As for the grip, as you'll read in other reviews, the mat has a very slippery surface that at first really frustrated me. But, after several rounds of Googone, warm water, and a few hours in the sun it is now just perfect. I don't slip at all!Only problem is my wife is now jealous of my mat and wants one too!"
5,Perfection!,"This is the perfect mat for me. Im 6'4"" finally a mat my whole body can lay on. I no longer have to touch the carpet during Bikram's Hot Yoga! I also luv that the mat does not absorb sweat, leaving the towel to do its job. By the next day I am off to yoga with a dry fresh mat!Steven 37 SF,CA"
1,My book has not arrived.,"I haven't receive the product yet. Still waiting for the book. And I really need it, as you can see."
2,damaged,"The book came damaged, but we can tell it was not from amazon, it must have been damaged in the printing."
3,Barney and Baby Bop talk in stilted rhyme,"Barney and Baby Bop go to the grocery store (which is actually a Tom Thumb location in Dallas) and talk about stuff to buy.My only problem is that this is supposedly two friends chatting in the store, but their ""conversation"" is in a stilted, forced verse. Why the author felt it had to be rhyme like this, is beyond me. She should leave the poetry to Dr. Seuss and just let the two guys have fun in the store.I'd choose another book in the ""Go To"" series if I were you."
3,very disappointing,"I expected more from this ""Best Guide"". Not a recommended book for those who are looking for a beginners guide. Lorin Roche has a much easier to read and fun book."
5,"Wonderful Meditations, Uplifting!","Great overview on meditation. I'll also recommend,Creating Money: Keys to Abundance (Roman, Sanaya)if you're into manifesting $$$ andThe Complete Idiot's Guide to Creative Visualization (The Complete Idiot's Guide)."
2,Neat,The display is really bad or maybe the one I bought had a portion of the display missing. It is heavier than I thought.
3,Probably not the best radio on the market,"Pros -1) The radio is light and well constructed.2) The buttons are easy to press3) Reception is goodCons -1)The Velcro tabs on the armband do not align properly. So when you place the radio on your arm, you have to twist the arm band. This makes the armband difficult to put on and mildly uncomfortable.2)The radio's headphones are deplorable. I cannot conceive of a more uncomfortable design."
1,Do not buy this radio,"I purchased this radio to replace my almost 20-year old analog armband radio. This particular radio, however, is useless: short battery life, cumbersome battery exchange, but most of all absolutely horrible reception. I ended up throwing it away and bought another, much better armband radio (different brand) at a third of the price."
5,great radio!!!!!,"i love my radio, its easy to use, light, functional and the sound is very clear. Im very happy with it. by the way battery is one AAA and it last forever!"
2,Not quite what I was looking for.,"This was actually the first meditation book that I bought. At that time I was searching for a spiritual path to help me with difficult life changes. I knew meditation was the path for me, but didn't know where to begin. The scope of Carrington's book tended to be too broad and clinical. The book's scientific mode may be useful to those who are interested in medical and psychological applications. Perfect for those who shy away from spirit. So, it's too cold for my purposes. For those with a similar purpose in mind I highly recommend Sogyal Rinpoche's Meditation booklet. My practice is grounded in the spiritual path, but I'm willing to give the book a chance for its scientific point of view. Not for me."
3,Worthy follow-up to her earlier book,"A comprehensive and worthy follow up to her earlier ""Freedom in Meditation"". This book is concise but not quite the 'Complete Guide' - as the title would suggest. It lacks the overall perspective of a book such as ""THE Autobiography..."" by Richard G. Patton (another great study in meditation), where the quest for Spiritual Liberation is explored in gripping depth. Personally I would rather read 'This is how it WAS', than 'This is how you CAN' books! It takes different strokes for different folks. I prefered her earlier work."
1,MALA OPCION - BAD CHOICE,"ESPAÑOL:No se les ocurra comprarlo. Contenido Desorganizado, pésima traducción al español (palabras en inglés, portugués y español todas mezcladas). Fotos blanco y negro que no se entienden. Explicaciones ambiguas. En definitiva el libro no te lleva a ningún lado, no lleva una organización metódica, las ideas son dadas como consejos sin explicar el ¿por que? ¿de donde salen?, bagua, yinyang, ciclos, a penas son nombrados y por supuesto nunca explicados. Dudo que este libro le pueda servir a alguien. Ojo, no dudo que el autor tenga conocimientos pues lo que dice es verdad, pero definitivamente se debe retirar de la pedagogía y mucho menos pensar en escribir libros. No sé como alguien puede colocarle 5 estrellas, definitivamente deben ser amigos del autor.ENGLISH:Save your money. Bad Translation. Lack of content. Disorganized. Definitely, no one who have read this book is able to practice fengshui."
3,A decent movie with some weaknesses,"This was an entertaining movie with some strong performances. However, something about it is lacking an air of realism. I've attended many AA and NA meetings myself, and the portrayal here is somewhat cliched and not completely accurate. I've also been through several treatments, and the portrayal here is also ""off"" somehow. Modern treatment centers don't really operate in the way things are portrayed here. If you want to know what most AA meetings are really like, find an ""open"" meeting in your area and attend it. However, this movie was entertaining and the performances are good. It was a bit over-long, and there was too much focus on the romance between Keaton and Baker. More realism, less sentimentality and a little more cutting-room time, and this movie could have been better. But I enjoyed it.Note - The DVD version is offered only in pan-and-scan, and there are literally no features on the disc."
2,Fair.,"Viewed: 2/06Rate: 42/06: Clean and Sober starts off strong, has a fair middle, and then finishes with a bombed out ending. Although it's an interesting picture, the whole of the movie couldn't be held together for some reasons. I wasn't convinced about the desire of Daryl, played by Michael Keaton, for the girl. Neither was I convinced if Daryl was really addicted to drugs. The boyfriend of the girl was incredibly stoic and one-dimensional. A couple of twists in Clean and Sober elevates the film slightly, and then, it is a long winding down. The film just had to have everything in place in order for Clean and Sober to be a success, but it was too superficial for me. A nice small role for Morgan Freeman there, definitely on his way to stardom."
1,Its NOT closed captioned,"Yes, that IS a reason to flunk it, as a DVD.If people in the house can't follow the movie then ITS WORTHLESS!!If it isn't bad enough that the deaf and hard of hearing are the last group to be opening discriminated against left in America, if it isn't bad enough that before you even buy a movie you have to research just to make sure it has CC, in 2007!What's worse? When it says on Amazon this movie has it, and it does not.What's worse? When it says on the DVD BOX it has it, and it does not!YES I know how to use CC, if it's anywhere on a DVD I WILL find it.How long is all this blatant discrimination going to continue, yes I still run into DVD's with no CC, in 2008 almost now.So I guess all the drunk and doped up deaf and hard of hearing will continue to not have an outlet to see themselves if they have a substance problem, which my brother does."
2,really bad,"Oh, this was a bad film. It was acted well, yes. The characters may have been a teeny bit interesting, but boy, was this a bad movie and not at all representative real life."
3,OK,"I picked this film up for it's 80's nostalgia. It depicts the AA/NA meetings/groups and sponsors well. it's still hollywood, but is pretty true to form. Great performance by Morgan Freeman and Michael Keaton."
4,McCoy's Musings,"During the course of a graduate school class, this student was required to watch this movie and discuss it. In her own opinion, she considers this movie very good even though there are scenes in it that are not accurate. For example, the scene where the counselor accuses a patient of being high and orders her to leave. In real life, if a counselor suspects a client of being intoxicated, tests will be ordered to either confirm or rule out the suspicion. These tests protects everyone's legal rights. Otherwise, this movie could be a good introduction to the issue of addictions and treatment."
5,Clean and Sober review,"Clean and Sober is my favorite Michael Keaton movie. His portrayal of a man caught up in the fast lane who gets in over his head with drugs and alcohol is stunningly realistic. Watching Keaton go through an addicts journey to sobriety is painful, poignant, and at times humorous. Clean and Sober is one of my 'feel good' movies."
5,The Greatest book of all,THIS IS THE MOST FUN BOOK OF ALL IT HAVE MAGIC TRICKS AND RIDDLES AND SECRETS AND THE MOST FUN STUFF OF ALL REALLY BUY IT BECAUSE IT IS GREAT ENTRETANIMENT FOR YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS!!!!!!!!
5,A really fun book,This book is very fun. It has so many fun games that you can do when your bored like on an airplane or a car.
1,Completely Unreadable,"I would have given it NO stars, but that's not an option. I'm so furious that I spend hard-earned money on this book. I deserve a refund. I had such great hopes for this book... I thought it might be a fun look into the workings of the male mind. A bit of the Bridget Jones for blokes... but, I was dead wrong. It's not funny.. it's not sexy.. it's not entertaining. It's pretty much... well, a big fat nothing. Waste of money. :("
4,Excellent playing,"This is an excellent CD! These pieces are all wonderful, but it is the lesser-known 1st Wieniawski Concerto that stands out. This really is a wonderful concerto, that is sadly neglected, partly because of the fact that it is extremely difficult. Shaham handles everything beautifully, with amazing technic. It is worth it for this concerto alone! Everything else on the CD is very good, but the 2nd Wieniawski can't compare to the Heifetz recording."
3,Not what I thought it would be,"I ordered this book because I need to know things about how to design a home. I wanted specifics--how long of a span can you do with certain joists, what kind of supports do I need under the concrete; you get the idea. The book is much more about the theory of how you arrange the kitchen, what kind of windows you can use, etc. I was disappointed from the first chapter, where it recommends what kind of paper and t-square you need. I hope more people are using CAD than this author believes. The last chapter has advice on how to pick your architect. I thought the book was about being your own architect! The book was too general, and the title misleading."
3,Summary Review,"This publication has a very easy-to-follow format, it depicts most of the considered architectural design parameters for residential houses. It needs to have more extent on what refers to bathroom planning, and have a more straightforward approach on what refers to (kitchen/bathroom) cabinetry planning. It does not provide complete information about windows and doors either."
4,The B-Sides reign supreme...,"Kula Shaker really hit the nail in with this fine, smally packaged ep. Even though it contains Govinda(another mix), which you already know from K, it is still a wonderful little collection of music. Moonshine and Troubled Mind serve as dazzling encores to the small ep. Dance In Your Shadow is another one which can be heard not only as a b-side or on this cd, but on the separate cd to K in selected discs. A few more original b-sides would have earned this cd 5 stars. But if you consider quality, and not quantity, it definitely deserves 5..."
5,"The ""Trip"" is not over yet!","A must have for those who can't wait for their second album, and for those who barely gets some great b-sides. Just when I thought that the trip has reached its peak and slamming straight down, the Summer Sun EP cushioned the fall. ""Gokula"" is a rocker where the riff is borrowed from ex-beatle George Harrison's Wonderwall track ""Ski-ing"". This EP serves as an appetizer for a coming masterpiece only from Kula Shaker."
2,Not what I thought,"It's a lovely book, but I thought it would be more discography, picture, and biography related. It's a collection of articles that have written before and now reprinted. It has a nice section of fan stories and they are the highlight of this book. There is NO new revalations on Olivia that any die-hard fan doesn't know or hasn't known in the past about Olivia. I was hoping for a book that would be useful in research on Olivia. Maybe Olivia's story will be told by Olivia herself soon and it will be the must have book on Olivia surely, not this one. Sorry about that chief :o("
5,Simply - WOW!,"An amazing voice. Easily one of the top half-dozen tenors of the Twentieth Century. His early death - from a fall down a flight of stairs - cut short his life. If you want to explain the word ""timbre"" to someone, play a recording by Wunderlich. This set includes items released on other CD's and even cassette tape. I never tire of hearing him. Perfection."
4,It works and it's warm,"Not much to say, it's warm to at least 18-20*F and had adequate room to move if you have broad shoulders, a bit bulky but it is a synthetic stuffed 0* bag. ALPS Mountaineering makes decent stuff at affordable prices."
5,Smooth Listening,"In a word; eclectic. Some of the most relaxing sounds to calm a restless spirit. And what an astounding ensemble of accomplished musicians. You need not understand the language of some of the selections, any one of which you'll still find enjoyable."
2,Huge disconnect,I love Kathleen Battle's glorious voice. Unfortunately I don't love jazz piano which is mostly what the backup is on this cd. I found it annoying and hard to listen to. I would have preferred her singing a cappella! It just didn't seem that the soft spirituals and lullabies were served well by the tinkly piano background in most of the pieces. Listen to the samples before you order this one.
3,"To listen to, but not to share...","I got this one as a baby shower gift, to play for my baby. While the CD does contain lullabies and traditional songs that a baby may like to listen to, when you're ready to sing along and share, Ms. Battle's voice goes places the average mom and dad can't. I liked listening to it while rocking my daughter, and the songs are beautiful, but I put it away for albums I could sing along with."
4,Ear Candy,"This is an unusual recording for Ms. Battle, who generally performs ""classical"" music. The material here ranges from lullabies to folk tunes to smooth jazz, all very accessible. Her voice is definitely the center of focus; varied accompaniments are all tasteful and capable. The recording is flawless.If you enjoy a lovely female voice and soothing music, you should enjoy this one. (Kathleen Battle could sing ""Louie, Louie"" and make it sound gorgeous!)"
4,Beyond Opera,"""So Many Stars"" proves once again that Kathleen Battle has a musical atristry that defies containment within a single genre. The songs included in this CD go from spanish lullaby, to spiritual, to jazz.Hush is in a word perfect; this performance seems to effortlessly blend the spiritual with jazz. Cancion de Cuna - an exquisitely performed spanish lullaby. Azulao - beautiful and sensual with an almost calypso feeling. The Little Horses features Grover Washington Jr. and Cyrus Chestnut; performed like a jazz lullaby, lovely and tender. A spritely melody, Fais Do Do swings; Ms. Battle's singing is exquisite throughout; Cyrus Chestnut and Ira Coleman stand out. Ms. Battle brings a subtle power to another jazz spiritual Going Home.Para Ninar - a masterful rendition; Ms. Battle's voice blended with guitarists Lubambo and Herrington bring a mature sensuality to this brazilian piece.Altogether ""So Many Stars"" is filled with diamonds."
1,Badly written book with lot of mistakes,"I think that CAMP, APT, etc aren't good for investors, but this book misleads them even more. There are several mistakes, and opposite data in various chapters."
5,A Writer's Gem: Compact and Fully Loaded,"Clear, concise and packed with valuable tips, this booklet delivers. When I drag my feet about a writing project, this ""mini tome"" helps to refocus and get me writing again. The author's style in debunking each myth is deliciously deceptive. I found myself engaged immediately because the simplicity of what she says, and the clarity with which she says it, rings true. There's excellent stuff here, and a generosity of spirit to go with it. Highly recommended."
3,It's a shame.,The greatest marvel of the Sinopoli set is undoubtedly the Salome of Cheryl Studer. Studer is very sensual and at the same time very girlish and therefore very cruel. She is capable of entrapping every male she wants in her web of intrigue and blood. She may not have the iron-like tones of Nilsson (the greatest Salome on record) but her sheer musicality makes her a very attractive Salome indeed. Terfel is a firm-toned Jokanaan. Sinopolis' conducting is not quite as terrifying as Solti's (and I mean that in a good way) but it's firm and powerful. This wood be a fantastic recording if it wasn't for Hiestermanns' Herodes. What were they thinking at Deutsche Grammophon? His contribution spoils half the recording. Hiestermann is absolutely not up to his difficult job of portraying the neurotic Tetrarch. He just hasn't got the vocal abilities. This just shows how important it is to cast a recording well.
3,Salome as symphony,"Several years ago I purchased this recording, in response to many positive reviews. Although Studer was good and Terfel terrific, I was greatly disappointed in the conducting. Revisiting it after about a year's gap, I can now appreciate the masterful symphonic sweep that Sinopoli achieves -- not to mention the vivid sonics. But there's still not a clue that Sinopoli knows that much of the music is supposed to represent actions and emotions; it's just a dramatic symphony with voices. Speaking of voices, Studer is even better than I remembered, and Terfel is indeed terrific. On the other hand, the Herod has what must be the worst voice of anyone pretending to be a classical singer; his vocal acting is very nice, but he literally can't carry a tune. Who hires these people?"
4,Whose biography is it anyway?,"Robert Marsh does an excellent, if tedious, analysis of conductors. His prime focus is on the development and accomplishments of James Levine which are many and praiseworthy. Mr. Marsh is obviously a critic of extraordinary talents as well. (He tells you so.) The book is well worth reading."
1,Terrible,"Just for the record, I love a lot of New Age music, but this one is Chinese water torture via new age ""music"". Its boring and worse torturous."
2,Lifeless performance,"Prokofiev's quartets are among my favorite pieces of music, so I have collected quite a few recorded performances of them (there are not that many, anyway). This one is the worst I've heard. It is mechanical, sped up, and devoid of any emotion. The recording itself is quite unfortunate too - dry, tinny sounding, lacking depth. Let me highly recommend this performance instead, although it is also not entirely flawlessNadarejshvili, Prokofiev: String Quartets. As a bonus you get an outstanding quartet by Nadarejshvili.This wonderful music deserves much better than Emersons."
2,"Second-best Prokofiev, pleasantly played","Bad reviews aren't popular at Amazon, but the good reviews of this CD are to my mind rather misleading. Prokofiev did not successfully translate his quirky, tangy idiom to the string quartet, and these two works are generally considered glib failures of imaginaiton as well. Prokfiev's idiom depended on several things that are absent here: soaring, sweet string lines, motor rhythms backed up by strong percussion, tunefulness, and often a folkloric foundation.These quartets contain a bit of his idiom, but there's no message. They are too timid and faceless. One can tell that they're by Prokofiev, but comparisons with Bartok, Schonberg, or Shostakovich are wishful thinking."
1,The book has a complete lack of organization & factual info.,"This book completely lacks in organization and factual information. Houseplants appear almost randomly throughout the book. In at least one case, the same picture of the same houseplant appears on two different pages, listed with two DIFFERENT NAMES!!! Has nice pictures, but that is absolutely the only good component of this book. As a senior in college majoring in horticulture, I recommend discounting most, if not all, of the information in this book."
1,The Legend of Hero,"I hate this assissinated DVD version! It is not the complete story! It's been abridged/mangled/mutilated so badly the story's messed up. The scenes jump from one to the other disjointedly, I don't know what's going on! I would not recommend this DVD version to anyone else. Don't waste your money!The Legend of Hero"
3,The Secret Garden,"I thought that the book The Secret Garden was an ok book.I think that Mary played a great role in the book. She was my favorite character in the whole book of course because she was the main character,and because she was kind of like me in a way. I thought that she was like me because she was very nosey through the course of the book. She was also a very good friend in the book to a little boy named Collin because he was very sick and laying in his bed for a fwe years. So she was trying to get him out of his bed and walking again, by taking him out in the garden."
3,The Secret Garden,I thought that the book the Secret Garden was a pretty good book over all.I mean Mary and Collin had a great friendship in the book.And Mary was very nice to help Collin get out of his bed and up on his feet.But I still think the movie was better.That's my review.
3,THe Ginger Bread Boy,There are several versions of the the Ginger Bread Boy this one is not my favorite but it is fine for a beginning reader.
5,Fantastic,"My pond has never been cleaner, I wish I had purchased this product years ago. I had originally thought the price was too high and tried to make my own skimmer. After I lost too many fish to count I purchased this and have been very happy."
2,Needs a Re-write,"I am considering joining Film Movement in spite of this movie. Sandra Oh and Ellen Page carry this film. The other actors are pretty-face middle aged with marginal talent. I doubt they are the best Canada has to offer. The young woman who played Ellen Page's school friend is a better actor than any of the adults, except Oh. The dialogue needs improvement. Sample of the cop's lines: Oh, yeah?...Really?... Why's that? The story is interesting, but the writing, directing, and editing are weak. An independent movie does not have to have these problems. I hope the film maker's other films are better."
3,Acceptable,"Not very fast. Gets very warm, almost hot, after even a minutes usage. Other products out there do not get this hot."
5,"VERY NICE, FAST, RELIABLE","Bought this off eBay, 4GB but half of flash price. I like the design so much!"
4,The ONLY bibs that worked for our little droolers,"We have twins who have had periods of AMAZING amounts of drool and the neck rashes that would come with it. Most of the bibs we could find either weren't absorbent enough or weren't waterproof enough to keep their clothes dry. These are PERFECT. We still have days were we have to change their bibs a few times, but their necks stay dry."
4,Exactly as described - great bibs,"I bought these bibs for the variety of bright, plain colors (No more trying to match lime-green-and-baby-blue bibs with pseudo-pithy sayings to outfits!!! Hooray!!) and the waterproof-ness. A few reviews had me worried about the latter, but do not fear - the bibs are three layers: two terry layers with a third waterproof (or at least very water resistant) inner layer. They've stood up to my 4-month-old's waterfall of drools quite well.Though these bibs are exactly as described, I have not given them five stars since they have a very scratchy hook-and-loop (generic Velcro) closure that irritates my baby's neck. I would much prefer snaps, or at least a side closure. If only more mothers developed products... :)"
1,Terrible bibs,"I got these thinking that they were just like the 5 pack I-play terry bibs that I bought [...], but they're not! The 5 pack is three ply, with the plastic sandwiched in the middle of two terry cloth covers, so drools and spit ups will not soak through. These just have the two layers with the plastic on the back, somehow it soaks right through leaving my son's chest all wet. It seems like the company is trying to save money or something by skimping on an extra layer of terry cloth. I can't recommend these, they didn't work for me. I suggest going to Babiesrus.com and buying the I-play 5 pack bibs, they are far superior, I depend on them every day and two months later, they've stood up very well to (almost) daily washings."
1,Practically See-through,"As of July 2011 these bibs are NOT made with any plastic between the 2 layers of terry, and the terry is so thin that you can practically see through it! I wouldn't buy these again, nor would I recommend them."
1,Doesn't work!,"I was very disappointed after using the first one for 30 minutes. My 10-month old son is teething and his drool soaked right through to the back after only 30 minutes, making his clothes all wet. I don't understand how they can sell these as waterproof. Also the color ran from the bib onto my son's white onsies. Total waste of money."
2,Ehhhh.....,"These bibs are ok. They are really thin, so on extra drooly or spit-up days they don't hold up well. They will soak straight through to my son's clothes. The pack comes with 10 bibs, so I always have a fresh one to change him into. But I wish they would work better so I don't have to change them out multiple times a day.The price is reasonable, but you get what you pay for. I wouldn't buy these bibs again."
5,Perfect for reflux babies,Our 4 month old baby has reflux so he spits up constantly! I was doing so much laundry a day until I bought two packs of these bibs. They are great and absorb a lot. 100% satisfied!
5,Great for babies with reflux/frequent spit up,"Although they dont look it, these bibs are truly waterproof. We were going through 10 bibs per day to avoid clothing changes. These keep my sons collar dry. I wish I found these sooner. He is about 5 months/13 lbs. They would have fit well at 2 months and we still have plenty of time until he grows out of them."
5,**EXACTLY** What I Wanted!!,"I would dress my son then get annoyed that his bibs didn't match his cute outfits. Vanity I know, but it got serious because the cute designs on the front of kid's clothing is always covered by their bibs so I cared. I bought these and VOILA! now I don't have that issue! Every time I dress him I have a bib to match. WOOHOO!! Oh and these wash very well, the color isn't fading and the waterproof lining is great. I would purchase again, as a gift, or in a different pack of colors."
3,Still deciding if I like them,"So these are waterproof for sure, but absorbent? Not so much. The drool just rolls off of them onto everything else. My son is teething and super drooly these days but these bibs are just getting drool on everything else like his pants, shoes, and on me and anyone else holding him. I love the waterproof part to an extent, but it would be nice if they actually absorbed something."
1,Terrible!!! Not Waterproof at all!!!!,I bought these bibs for the 'waterproof' nature. My son was still SOAKED!!! The liquid soaks right through these bibs! Waste of money!!! DO NOT BUY!!!
4,"not for spitting, but good for drooling","These bibs are waterproof for sure. If your baby spits, everything will just slide down to his outfit. For spits I highly recommend Aden and Anais. But these are the BEST for drooling. The only downside is the velcro, I hate it, it will stick to anything, and it will make a terrible noise and wake the baby up."
5,Best. Bib. Ever.,"These are the best bibs ever. I started using them with my second child as he is a bit of a spitter upper. They have a waterproof lining in between both of the terry cloth sides. They are wide enough, long enough and so far, I haven't had any issues with the velcro closure. I have 20 of these - they are the only ones we use! I started using these from 1-month for my son and they fit great."
4,Good for the price,"Very good quality for the price. I generally prefer snaps in the back over Velcro, but they didn't scratch my baby's neck at all, so no complaints."
3,SOFT COMFY COTTON- BUT NEEDS A WASH AFTER EACH USE!,"Good thing these come in packs of 10, because just one time of trying to feed a 5 month old leaves these bibs soaked and sticky! Yes, they are waterproof because of the liner inside, but the cotton terry still gets as wet and dirty as any piece of clothing after being soaked in rice cereal. Baby's clothes stay dry underneath, but you cannot use the bib again without washing it. Nothing else to be expected from a cotton bib, off course, but we just went through them so quickly and before I knew it they were all in the wash! Now I use plastic or nylon ones that you can just rinse off quickly and are good to go again for the next feed. Baby Bjorn makes a nice one, and so does Skip Hop."
3,Sigh...,"I bought two ten packs of these because my drooler was constantly soaked. I like these better than the Carters bibs, because they are not as stiff. The big benefit is that there are so many of them and can be changed frequently. I wouldn't order them again, though, because my order of two packs of boys bibs arrived as two packs of girls bibs. I was so bummed. I even checked my order to see - sure enough, in the box on top of 20 girls bibs, was my invoice for 20 boys bibs. Sigh. I kept the unisex ones and gave the pink ones to a friend. I realize I could have returned them, but I shop online to avoid hassle and I really needed bibs. Now I'm back shopping for bibs again. I give the product 3 stars, maybe 4 stars when I'm not feeling bitter about the pink bibs."
4,Great daily bibs,"Since my four month old daughter has a significant amount of drool most of the day, we needed a lot of bibs so we could swap them out when they became too wet. These bibs work quite well, although the fabric is a bit thin. They keep her dry, and happy. I will say that the ""girls version"" of these bibs are way more expensive, which I think is a bummer. Honestly they are just primary colors, so it isn't a big deal."
5,"I like them, ordered second pack","Despite some reviews, I do not have problems with the bibs. They do not get wet beyond middle layer, baby remains dry. You have to change them several times a day, but it is just a normal thing. I bought two packs,and I am happy with them."
3,"Okay bibs, started out excellent","These bibs are amazingly absorbent, our baby Matthew remains dry all day as a result. This product is highly recommended for all the super droolers out there!Correction: these bibs are amazingly absorbent, but left my baby with a rash, so I have to alternate with softer bibs."
1,NOT Waterproof!,"I bought these because I was tired of changing the baby every 10 minutes. Spit up and drool is a normal thing. These are marketed completely wrong.1) They are NOT waterproof at all2) They are NOT absorbent at allWithin 5 minutes of wearing these after feeding baby, the clothes are completely wet and the entire bib is drenched. It seems that one area that is wet seems to spread out throughout the entire bib.The terry cloth also keeps the wetness feeling icy cold against baby skin and even if I touch it.Also be careful, the velcro is verrrry scratchy (more so than usual) and is only stitched down with fabric covering the edge of the velcro on 2 of the 3 sides. I've sliced my finger on more than 1 occasion from that stupid velcro (it's like a paper cut), so imagine what it can do to the baby if you're not careful.Not worth it...."
1,Too small,"These bibs are perfect for a 3month old but did not fit my 7month old. He is only 16lbs. The colors are great, but I wish the sizing was clear in the description."
2,"Both waterproof and absorbent - fantastic! However, red color bled.","I'm beyond sad. I love these bibs. They are the only ones I've found that don't leak drool onto my LO's clothes, but I just discovered the red one bled all over one of my LO's best white outfits. (I did prewash the bibs and he wore it one other time over a black shirt so it's been washed at least twice before bleeding) I'm hoping it will wash out, but I'm not holding my breath. I haven't noticed a problem with the other colors and I have the boy and girl color set. (I haven't used the pink girl ones though.) I'll still continue to use these bibs, but I might look harder for another waterproof absorbent bib if I were to buy more. (Though, I'm not sure if there is anything else out there.)My other complaint about these is that the velcro closes in the middle. I much prefer bibs that move the velcro over to the side so it is not right behind the baby's head and it's easier to get on and off."
4,Generally a good product,"These are great bibs, but a little big still for my 3 month old. He spits up all day long, so we use these to try to preserve his clothes. Since the neck opening is still a little big for him some of his clothes still get pretty soaked. The only real negative thing about these bibs is they really stink after being wet (with spit up) for a while. His other non-waterproof bibs don't stink nearly as bad after the same amount of time... it must be the waterproof layer. I kinda wish they were a little bit heavier and wouldn't move around as easily. Regardless, these are decent bibs."
4,Fabric rather rough,"I wanted to like those, I really enjoyed several other products by Green Sprouts. Simple, well made, double sided waterproof bibs which go with every outfit. 5 starts for that and minus one for the fabric. It is fairly rough terry. Not nice, plush or soft. Rubbed on my face it felt a little like a sandpaper. Not horribly bad, but not something I would like to have stuck underneath my chin for a few hours. Maybe I got a bad batch because I haven't seen many other people complaining about that. Maybe washing would soften them - I am not willing to take that chance and will be returning. Too bad because there is not many of the slogan-free, solid color bibs out there."
4,yaya,"Very good sized bib, its long which anyone knows it really helps.Cute design I would recommend it, its also waterproof,good buy."
5,Love for All Day Wear!,"I purchased a set of these and a few weeks later purchased another set. They are a good price and do good for all day wear when baby is drooling crazily. These are not good if your baby is a ""soaker"", but for the purposes we have used them, they have been great! They are thin, so again, if you want something thick, these aren't what you are looking for, but for less than $2.00 a bib, I can't complain. I got one set on sale where they were less than $1.00 a bib. We have loved these and when they get nasty, I do not mind throwing them out. They have even been good as the baby has started eating, but am purchasing something bigger. They have the sleeve bibs I will be getting."
2,Impractical,"Although I usually love Green Sprouts products, these bibs are poorly designed. As others have mentioned the velcro closure is VERY scratchy and irritates my baby's neck, even though I'm careful when putting them on and taking them off. Also, the washing instructions say to line dry. With the amount of laundry I do, I can't be line drying bibs."
4,Great for the price,"These bibs are great for the price. They aren't terribly soft or absorbant and the velco is scratchy. But for the price you really can't go wrong. I throw them in the dryer on low and they've been fine. I think that they will last until my son is 12 months old, or at least for a few more months."
3,Great except for the velcro,"These bibs are wonderful!! They feel nice, they wash well, they truly are waterproof and they have a layer of material on each side of the bib with the waterproof piece in the middle (3 layers total). The downside if that the velcro is really rough (not the smoother kind most baby products use)...so the velcro scratches the back of his neck. Overall, I really like the bibs but I'm going to convert the velcro to a snap button."
2,Too thin!,"My 5 month old twins are drool factories! I was having a difficult time finding waterproof bibs, so I ordered these. They fit well, and also had some room for growth. However, the bib still needed changing after an hour. The reverse side of the bib would become wet, so the reversible option is not very useful. The only feature I did find useful was the terry cloth fabric, which dried quickly."
2,not for a toddler who drool constantly,"When the product states that it's waterproof, I expected my son's shirt to stay dry at least 1-2 hrs. but it was very disappointing to find out within 30 min. his shirt got wet. even though it has plastic layer in the middle, didn't feel like it. it wasn't absorbent at all.according to the packaging, it's for 3 to 12mo olds. amazon's product description doesn't say anything about suggested age range. my son is 16months old who drools constantly. maybe this product should only be used for kids under 12mo. and doesn't really work for heavy drooling toddlers. very disappointed in the product and amazon lacking product description."
3,"Good deal, material's a little bit rough",Bought it per SIL's recommendation. Works well with toddlers who make a messy scene during feeding sessions. I use it on my newborn but find the material a little rough for his delicate skin. Good deal at $2 per bib.
2,not worth it.,"These bibs are a great value however after first wash they lose their softness and isn't very aborbant. Go for the more expensive bibs, its worth it."
1,I bought this?,"I remember seeing this, but I guess I never learned cuz I have no recollection of ever using this product... I gave it one star cuz I never learned how to play guitar. It's easier to blame the computer program for my failure! :P"
4,"Very user friendly, accept...","I'm a musician, and I'm trying to learn guitar as well. This is great, it really goes through the basics, and has been very helpful.However, it doesn't teach you accuratly how to tune. I can't stand doing all these exercises out of tune. It drives me crazy, and makes me want to put the guitar back in the case, untill someone can tune it for me.I don't want to invest in a tuner, untill I know I want to keep learing how to play, and I don't want to play while I'm so out of tune! What a vicious circle :)."
4,Awesome read,"great book, just wish I had bought it before the trip, would have been the perfect companion along the route"
5,Exciting and revealing,"This is great popular history, much better than the hyper-analytical stuff that European intellectuals or Ivy League types write. And the book tells you interesting things that these PC tyrants won't, like that Lloyd George was born in Alabama and that Welshmen win arguments by simply outlasting their opponents, ducking their heads in totally randomized ways.Not to be missed. Makes you want to have another go at it and see if we can win with even more heroics. Just no revolutions this time, all right?"
1,"Entertainment, how sad.","Grooms writes a very entertaining book about World War I. He describes the hardships soldiers faced in the trenches during the Great War. Yet, I cannot take his work serious. The book lacks evidence! He writes over 240 pages of historical data and never cites one source to back his thesis. I am astounding by this major effort. I am appalled that this book was published without any citations."
2,Guns of November,"This is not a well written book. It has flashes of brilliance but never delves into the real meat of the matter. For example, we never really meet General Haig or Prime Minister Lloyd George and so never understand the conflict between them. I enjoyed Groom's book about the civil war, but this one is a throw-away. I was astounded to learn of the great losses suffered by the British--fighting for the French and Belgians! The best WWI book is still ""Guns of August"" Pick it up first."
3,good transaction,this was a good movie to me not the best work of courtney cox but overall it was an ok film. i give it 3 stars.
1,Ridiculous and Pointless!,"Sophie Jacobs sits in the car while her boyfriend, Hugh, gets some stuff in a store. The store is robbed with people shot. Everything else afterwards is either real or fantasy.(Hint: was Sophie a witness to the crime?)I chuckle when people see this type of movie and say that they guessed the ending within the first 5 minutes because I know that's not true, but in November's case, it's really true. There's a clip during the title credits that's a major spoiler.The movie itself is dull and lifeless. The story is told and retold with no direction. This movie is a build-up to the end which is a real let down. The only thing that's worth noting is the cinematography. The film moves from pale, to rouge, to finally a colorful shade. The acting is solid but who cares? The story is a disaster!"
3,"Interesting, but confusing","This movie started out very interesting, but going through the same day over and over got very confusing, and at the end of the movie felt let down. At first, I thought someone was going insane, hallucinating, or dreaming different things, or that possibly it was in fact the woman who shot her boyfriend, or that someone was playing mind games with her. It was very intriguing trying to figure out the plot just to find that(SPOILER ALERT)?these are the thoughts that are going through her mind as she is dying?"
2,horrible,"cannot believe courteney cox agreed to do a movie this horrible after being a friends star. i like psychological thrillers, but this is just plain bizarre."
2,Consistent in its confusion,At one point in the movie the investigating detective commented that the photos were too artsy to be much help....what he wanted was clear images. This sentiment sums up my impression of the movie. It is one thing to allow the viewer to fill in the spaces and come to their own understanding ~ it is quite another to create spaces large enough to swallow the experience. Nothing about it compelled me to even care about the truth by the time it crawled to its disappointing conclusion.
1,NOTHING IN NOVEMBER,"Director Greg Harrison has made what must be a personal film for him, because it sure isn't audience friendly. Courteney Cox plays a young woman whose boyfriend is apparently killed during the robbery of a convenience store. Or is he? Next thing we know it might be a dream she's having because she feels guilty about cheating on her boyfriend. Next, it's Courteney herself in the convenience store and no boyfriend around; and finally, well not one to spoil movies I can't say what happens the last time around.NOVEMBER suffers from artsy filmmaking that sometimes seems to be so lauded at film festivals. But when a movie's ambiguity is so forcefully fed to us, how can one know what they've just watched. Cox is tediously boring in her role, and Anne Archer as her mother is wasted. James LeGros as the boyfriend is almost petrified in his performance as well.I didn't like this movie at all; its pretentious, self-serving and just dull."
5,A great book that gets results!,This book should be required reading for any management position. A useful guide for achieving positive results.
2,Review of Bella Dancerella: Let's Dance! Ballet Fun,"We were very disappointed in this DVD. The Bella Dancerella Swan Lake and Pop Star DVDs were so much better. My 6 year old daughter has danced with the latter two over and over. The ballet DVD has some goofy ""creatures"" added which gears it more for preschool age and the star in this DVD has an accent which makes her more difficult to understand.It lacked the energy the other two DVDs have."
2,Talking or Ballet??????,"LOTS of talking unrelated to ballet, with a creepy bear and monkey. LOTS Of talking! Also, there is a mat being used, if you don't have the mat, then you're OUT."
5,my daughter loves this!,Wonderful and charming little video! Its fun to watch and dance to. I would recommend it for your little dancer.
2,You do get what you pay for!,Even at $31 delivered you are only getting poor quality tools in a cool little package. These tools are truly best for those who would have no tools otherwise. I purchased the 40 piece set at $9 in order to check out the quality; it seamed to good to be true....it was.
2,"average tools, less than average quality","The storage chest is crap. The tools themselves are low quality and poorly measured (for fit to the job). 1/2"" maybe 1/2 or a little more, or a little less. The storage chest is held shut by a vertical plastic bar that can easily be lost or broken. I like the way each tool has its own place. Not too bad for backup to your backups"
3,the number 13 socket is missing from the brand new package,the number 13 socket is missing from the brand new tool kit. we would like to have it shippped to us at no cost to us. this is a gift for my grandson i would like to have the socket replaced so that he gets a whole kit as apposed to one missing a piece. thank you deborah davis
4,You get what you pay for,"I would not buy anything from greatneck again because of the poor quality of this tool set.BUT: I still use it all the time and its a great starter set, just wouldnt buy anything more from this company. The wire strippers are 100% useless but everything else is okay, the pliers and screw bits rust pretty quickly, but I still use all the sockets."
1,Cheap set,This set is very cheap and all of the tools are breaking. This was a xmas present for my husband.
3,No clue how to rate this,"I bought it to be a home tool kit and my husband took it to work and never brought it home so I don't know how it works. Had to buy a hammer, screw driver and wrench to hide in my underwear drawer from him because he is such a tool miser lol."
4,awesome tools,i got my products today and iam very pleased about what i got all of the peices where with these items so iam very satisfied but Amazon could be cheaper on some of there stuff but its alright ill pay for it cause i use my tools everyday so im happy now thanks amazon
1,Cheap and useless,This thing is full of a bunch of useless tools that no average around-the-house type guy would use for anything. The box itself is cheap and the drawers are hard to open. I don't even think it comes with a screwdriver. Don't get this....beware!
2,You get what you pay for,"Everything about this is low cost, low quality. It is not a bad deal but next time I will gladly spend more to get more."
3,good,When I got it there was a chip in one of the pieces... which makes it hard to use it. All the pieces were all over the place. Should have been taped down. The silver sliders on the drawers were coming off. Kinda disappointed but still a good product
3,Not bad for the price,I got this for Xmas and i must say not a bad set the case is very week and will not even hold the items in place properly but the tools them self's work fine and have no defects.
2,You get what you pay for...,"Really cheap tools that you'd expect to find at a bargain/dollar store. Spend more money and get something better. Even the box it comes in, seems cheaper than the picture."
2,Poor Quality,I thought the tool box was a very poor quality. Tools were ok. I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Be careful. My brother cut himself opening up this kit for the first time!,"I bought this as a gift for my brother. He sent me a picture of a gash on his finger caused by a razor blade sticking out. It wasn't properly secured and was moving about the box (possibly due to shipping). Still, it is unacceptable that razor blades are not properly secured and cause someone to cut himself on first use.Also, 205 pieces applies to individual razor blades and zip ties. The value is not what it seems."
2,It will do...,"I couldn't expect much for what I paid, but I think the packaging was the biggest problem here. I wasn't expecting a high quality tool set, just something with some basics that the family could keep all in one place. The chest arrived damaged, I've gotten it back to useable, but the rod to keep the drawers held in still won't line up.Didn't think it was worth sending back - we'll make it work."
4,pretty cool for the price,"My husband needed a starter set of tools, so I ordered this one as a gift to him and it shipped fast and was here before the date shown for delivery! The outer box is a little cheap but the tools work for what we need them. Definitely recommend this for a starter set!"
4,Mr. Moto Handles The Necessary Liquidating,"This was the second in the Mr. Moto series, begun shortly after Marquand returned from his 1935 China trip. As was his custom, Marquand used two young people as the protagonists who found themselves unwittingly immersed in a mystery. While they struggled to solve the dilemma, the amateur sleuths were aided by Mr. Moto who appeared at crucial moments to make the heavy decisions and do the necessary liquidating.Marquand does a good job of describing the tensions in pre-World War II China . In order to enjoy the story, the reader will have to ignore some 1930's racial stereotypes."
1,Bloody,"There is no greater karmic negativity than to build a fortune withthe blood of innocents.The CBC interviewed the CDC on the incubation period of Mad Cow(50 years). As millions more become vegetarian each year,as the fight for precious land becomes more and more costly,those who waste the land in raising animals for slaughterwill be legislated out of business.Cattle dollars' poor prospects caused Warren Buffett toend his investments."
5,Buy This Ceiling Fan,"This fan was easy to install (once the proper junction box was installed!) and is whisper quiet. For these reasons alone, this fan is worth purchasing."
1,Garbage~~,"I find this book full of useless theories, nonsense, NOT practical at all. Also, its contents are difficult to understand and obviously the author cannot communicate his ideas clearly to his readers. DONT purchase this book, EVEN if you have money to burn~~"
1,Trash,This book is absolutely worthless. I made the mistake of buying only because it was cheap. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. There is only one basic premise here for improving concentration: spend ten minutes every morning and night picturing yourself concentrating. What? Do not waste your time and money.
3,The Ultimate Fighters Season 7,Another good season of The Ultimate Fighter from Spike TV. Being a huge Griffin & Rampage fan i enjoyed this alot and thought it was an improvement on season 6 with some great fights and a fantastic finale.A must see for UFC fans!
5,very entertaining,"Christopher Walken has got to have one of the best on screen presents in all of hollywood,this movie is great about 5 guys who decide to kidnap a mobster(walken) for money supposedly they need to get a girlfriend back who has also been kidnaped.Well acted by all the cast, with an edge of your seat feel, this movie is well worth the price asked and then some."
3,In general a pretty decent movie.,"First off this is defnitely a dark comedy, so if that sort of thing isn't your gig stay away.If you like dark comedy then this is definitely a worthwhile purchase. The premis is simple, A rich kid ticks off the wrong people, so they kidnap his sister. He and his friends decide the way to resolve this is to kidnap a former Mobster and use his money and ties to resolve the issue.This movie has several unique twists and turns that make it very interesting.The DVD itself is unremarkable, and definitely does nothing to justify the original list price.The movie I would give a 4 The DVD a 2for an aggregate score of 3."
1,You gotta be kidding me,"This was one of the worst movies I've seen. Why? Because it has no idea what it is. All it knows is that it wants to grow up to be Quentin Tarantino, but it has no idea what that means or how to go about it. What are we meant to laugh at? What are we not meant to laugh at? This movie doesn't know. Unbelievable."
3,Walken at his best,"What makes this film highly enjoyable are the excellent performances of both Christopher Walken and Denis Leary. Walken gives a very sincere and creepy portrayal of a powerful Gangster. Lery is alot of fun as his second in command. I especially love the scene where he tells the drunk about his father and beats him senseless with the toaster. This film is not for the faint of heart, but I think there are those who would defintely like it."
5,"Especially intriguing, with some great scenes, The Tunnel","This was a movie that I really enjoyed. It kept me guessing the whole time. The scene in the Tunnel was fantastic. It got only a little gross when they cut a finger off, but not too bad. Great Cast!!"
3,"predictable movie plot however, ending does save it.",this is an easy movie to follow with limited scene changes and snappy dialogue. the plot has been done before. average movie foe entertainment if your hopes arent too high. the ending does twist it from as i expected so theat was a welcome.
5,Brilliant!,"An overall outstanding performance by a group of guys brilliantly cast into a dark comedy about a kidnapping gone awry. Great performances from Denis Leary and of course Christopher Walkin, as well as those preppy-guys that kidnap Walkin. Great casting job for a clue-esque movie."
2,It's a shame,"This movie had so much potential to be great. But at the end, it left me shaking my head. I like Christopher Walken and I think he's a great actor, but he was not to believalbe as this mob kingpin. I contribute a lot of that to a bad screenplay and bad directing.I think that the plot and the idea that the movie was swaying towards at the beginning was good but the movie was full of bad dialogue and terrible directing. Some of the stabs the movie made to try to be funny, didn't work. With execption to some Dennis Leary scenes. The characters weren't well rounded and the ""twist"" in the end was just flat out stupid. I would recommend not buying this DVD."
2,Suicide Kings Review,I don't know how to review this product because I have not recieved it yet. I don't know how long this particular vendor takes or how often he ships. I know it has been almost a month.
2,HAND ME THE BUSKET,"I did not think the movie was that great but,the scene with leary and the windwasher guy was brilliant""come on man you got a benz and all i got is this BUSKET"" ""give me the busket,give me the busket""I laughed so hard I cryed.I thought my wife was going to leave me for repeating BUSKET & ""give me the busket!""Okay ive changed my mind 5 big ole BUSKETS for this one."
4,This is Christopher Walken,"Suicide Kings is a movie based on a dark and twisted tail of revenge and betrayal.Amateur rich kids succeed in kidnapping a former mob boss (Christopher Walken) forcing him to help them find a kidnapped sister of one of the group. the mob king is able to get key information from the kids and manages to talk them into freeing him where he ends cleaning all the associates of the plot.Great entertaining Movie, Christopher Walken Style. The DVD is good in sound and picture. Enjoy"
2,Highly overrated,"The film Suicide Kings takes a promising premise--a bunch of rich brats kidnapping a mob boss--and destroys it with unlikable, poorly developed characters, tediously repetitive humor (Denis Leary's stingray boots), and a ridiculous ending couched as a clever plot twist. The only bright spots were the understated performance by Walken as the mob boss and the fittingly dark setting. Otherwise, the acting, dialogue, and story were highly overrated."
2,This movie was OK,This movie was pretty good for a comedy. I would never let a child see it because of its coarse stronge languge. There trash mouth talking get tiredsome but besides that its a great movie.
5,Very Good,"I enjoyed this movie greatly. The actors do a great acting job, especially Walken (who is always terrific). The movie contains many plot twists which keep the viewer interested. A must see!"
5,A must see for any Christopher Walken fan!,"This movie has an excellent, well written plot. Walken is in true form and Leary always adds his own comedic touch. I recommend everyone who enjoys Walken or Leary to see this film."
4,A great movie with an excellent cast.,"I'm not usually a fan of independent films, but I loved this one. Its strength lies not in its plot, but in the casting. Dennis Leary in particular is great, even if he's merely playing himself. Christopher Walken is a satisfying antagonist (as always), and Jay Mohr is a good hero (or is he the hero?). There is a perfect blend of comedy and serious undertones. A very watchable movie."
4,"Walken, Talkin'","Great Comedy, decent drama, flawed crime thriller...Though the above is true, we throw into the fold one Mr. Christopher Walken and low and behold we get greatness... You put him in a film and it seem every other character on screen is humbled by him. And here is no exception, I mean even though he spends most of the film tied to a chair, there isn't one moment when he doesnt seem dangerous.Denis Leary also excels, though he's hardly playing against type, as the Angry, Ranting, Irish American. The young cast are also pretty solid, Jay Mohr and Johnny Galecki in particular...The DVD is great, for such a small movie they've done a really good Job... there's nice little video introductions by O'Fallon to most of the Special Features (The Alternate endings are particularly interesting) a decent Commentary, and a couple of other little novelty extras.You then Take into account that it's less than $10 and you got yourself a solid DVD."
5,Suicide Kings is excellent!,"Well, first of all I think Christopher Walken was excellent as he is in everything that he does. I think the small part that Dennis Leary played was perfect. And the idea and the character interactions where great.As for the other reviewers comments about the alternate endings being overshadowed by the directors comments. All you have to do is set it to the second audio setting to not have his comments."
2,Gritty? Independent? - It ain't Hitchcock,"With the code words ""gritty independent film"" I guess we're supposed to be impressed with the creative spark that spawned this. On the whole, though, this marginally witty film is supposed to be some sort of ""psychological suspense"" thing driven by dialogue. Whoa, man ... mind games. Watch Christopher Walken mess with some hapless fratboys! That's suspense?Denis Leary interludes are interspersed, reasonably implying an understanding of the tedium that is the bulk of this thing. So we get to hear Denis Leary do his ""this is what is wrong with this country"" spiel a couple times and beat a couple people up. Yawn. One reviwer said he thought 'Suicide Kings' was a self-parody. Alas, this movie really believes it is very clever. Some bumbling idiots have their minds messed with ... very psychological ... spooky, man."
4,sound track,"I was wondering if there was any way of getting a hold of the song ""shattered"" by Cinjun Tate, and Frankie Blue. If so please respond, it's a great song. oh ya the movie was good too.Thanks B.G."
2,"Ok, But","The pictures are pretty good, but there are several of the same train on the same day. Most of those were note worthy of several pages. I kept looking for the one photo that would make the book worthwhile....never found it. The photo narrations were pretty weak as well(no insight other than location). The biggest disappointment was that the bulk of the pictures are of trains in Chicago or somewhere in Ill. As I like to look at what is behind the train almost as much as the train itself, this was annoying. Maybe the name of the book should have been ""My Chicago pictures of trains that made it to St Paul."""
4,Much Variety,"I enjoyed volume 9 more than the others but still experienced the problem of too much variety. While just about all vocal lounge music, the styles vary heavily including tango, tropical lounge, 40's sounding, and afro lounge. This left me loving a hand full of tracks and absolutely hating others.Top tracks3 All I want - acoustic track with a touch of soul.6 Diferente - Tango at its best7 Con Mi Sombra - Catchy Tropical/Spanish loungeThe Bad9 You Ain't Really Down - features a intro base loop for two minutes12 Blue bird - awful afro lounge, where she actually raps!"
4,Back on track,"I have all the Costes series, so I guess I'm in a position to compare. I was quite disappointed with vols 6 & 7, so nearly didn't bother with vol 8, but in the end was glad I did. Vol 9 shows that the series is now securely back on track and I agree with a previous reviewer that this is almost on par with Etage 3. Definately worth a listen if you have enjoyed this series of albums at all."
4,The best so far,"At first listen, I thought it was just okay. After repeated listenings, wow, this really reminds me of Paris. Nice selection, can't pick a favourite as all the songs are good."
4,4 and 9,"Everyone has different tastes, but if you liked what you heard on Hotel Costes Quatre (and your tastes tend toward eclectic meldings of lounge, Brazilian, French, acoustic, electronic, contempo jazz, a little hip hop, and whimsical vocals, all in a thoughtful and well-rendered mix that's just right), then be sure to give this one a try (it's no Quatre, but it grew on me)."
2,"pretty boring ... on second thought, not all that bad!!!","I look forward to the newest Hotel Costes each year because it usually has at least ONE song that really grabs me, that really sounds ""new""--e.g., Organ Nights, Pt. 2 - Scott Grooves (#4) or Love Is Queen Omega - Zuco 103 (#8) or Leaving Monte Carlo - Physics (#5). (Obviously, I prefer upbeat.) This one is pretty much a dud. Usually there's a good mix of atmosphere/loungy stuff which segues into something fast or jazzy that has some new sound. This is is all very laid back. Guess I'll have to wait for #10 for something new.UPDATE: For the one millionth time, my expectations have fouled me up. This is a good compilation. Just a lot more laid back than previous Costes. Who knows? With repeated listenings, it may go to FIVE STARS."
2,500 Watts really?,"Overall a decent ""beginner"" unit, however don't leave your unit on all the time like I used to. I had to replace one of the fans inside because it started making noise after about a year of ""normal"" use. I don't like how the volume goes off completely when adjusting it quickly and the remote control button layout is absolutely horrible. It is loud for the size of the components however I have heard way better and louder units that are under 500 watts. Doesn't have 6 speaker stereo without the 5.1 like other similar systems of its time. The system is also really slow to load cds, mp3 cds and dvds and it is also too slow to change between tv/aux/dvd/radio modes. Would I recommend this unit to a friend? NO. Would I ever buy another Philips dvd player or home theater system? Very Doubtful. Would I ever buy another Philips product at all? Only with great hesitation and after researching and testing the product before buying it."
1,STAY AWAY,Bought this product 1 yr ago worked alright with some skipping of the video frames then recently started to hiss real bad. Ther custumer service man said that I was S.O.L I have to say that Phillips really has some piss poor people working for them......bad product
1,Philips Customer Relations is the WORST!,"First of all, this is the first product review I've ever posted online- but the customer service I've received from Philips is SO bad, they deserve a horrible review. I THOUGHT Philips was a reliable name, but based on the service I have received concerning a mechanical flaw with my unit, I will never buy from them again.God help you if you have any problems or defects with this product- because Philips certainly won't.Rather than simply replace it or repair it themselves, they insisted that I send mine to an ""authorized service center."" To make a long and incredibly frustrating story short, six weeks later I've finally got it back, unrepaired. So now my case is ""under review"" with Philips- who apparently may now decide I have to send it back to the same service center again?! For all the hassles I've been through already, I can't believe they won't simply replace this unit- or at LEAST repair it THEMSELVES."
4,I am having a great Time,"I have a great time with my new philips, I wanted something to add to my extra room. Easy install and it sound great for the price, I think it's a steal, now we can hang out in the nice room and my side room, of course now I can get 5.1 in all my rooms..........Yah baby!!!"
1,"If I could give this movie no stars, I would.","This is a typical flag-waving piece of American paranoid garbage from the mid-80s in which Cuban and Russian military commanders are made to look like fools by a bunch of ragtag, redneck small town U.S.A. teenagers. Yeah. Right. That'll happen."
1,Worst ever,This movie made my brain hurt it was so poorly acted/made. Don't watch this if you're just preparing for the new red dawn movie. Seriously.
3,Lighten up people!,"I enjoy this movie thoroughly but I will be the first to admit that it is pretty dorky. No it is not very realistic (even back in the 80's), both the Latin American invasion of the US or the invasion of the Russians via the Bering Strait, and the kids are just a bit too good and the Commies just a bit too bad at guerilla warfare. Ask the Afghan Guerillas how the Soviets fought Guerillas. Poisoned food, toys rigged with explosives, yellow rain, and Hind choppers that terrified even the Afghans. Still at the same time the movie is still enjoyable. Just don't take it too seriously. Lighten up everyone! It's like a Star Wars movie."
3,don't over analyze this movie,"corny? unrealistic? yes, but very entertaining if you are in the right mood. this movie may be a better rent than buy, though. when i originally saw this movie as a teen it was quite entertaining and still holds a warm place in my heart. ""wolverines!"""
4,"Here's my two cents, never to be seen again",Good movie. Semi-realalistic plot with decent acting. I liked how the KGB used gun regestration forms to round up gun owners. I didn't like the writer(s) portryal of the Boy Scouts.
1,Great Movie - Bad DVD,"This is one of my favorite, don't worry about the content, movies. I was totally disappointed with the DVD version. The picture quality was simply awful. Contrary to what was advertised, the DVD was a cheaply reproduced copy. I was so disgusted that I trashed the DVD and now look forward to watching Red Dawn on late night televison. Purchase this movie only from a highly rated vendor."
2,Bad movie made watchable by excellent perfomances,"This isn't the greatest movie ever made, but it also isn't the worst (Road To Wellville). Strong performances by Jennifer Grey and Powers Booth make it somewhat enjoyable. The story involves the invasion of the United States by the Soviets and their allies. Even though an invasion wasn't likely to ever happen, the movie did cause me to think about what I would do if something like that did occur. Of course, if another country tried to invade us, at least we have plenty of guns to defend ourselves. The same cannot be said of other counrties. Funniest scene to watch for: towards the end, when Patrick Swayze is holding a dying Charlie Sheen, watch for snot to come flying out of Patrick's nose. A little childish, but worthy of a rewind none the less."
3,A Little Dated,"Good and Bad here. I guess if I had to make a choice it would be on the side of good. Not great, but good. Some parts interesting. Nice to see Patrick Swayzee anywhere....even at this young age. What if .... this were to happen today .... only with our government being the ""bad guy?"" Hmmmmm"
5,A classic everyone should see.,"A great movie with a bunch of great actors in their youth. Well directed, edited, and written too. This movie is being remade in a climate when the possibility of something like this happening feels closer to truth for many."
4,gfood,such an awesome movie ... the songs are catchy and fill the ears. it is a joy to hear such well constructed music!
4,Good movie,Somehow I managed to completely miss this movie's existence. It came up in conversation and some of my friends were adamant that I had to see it. Definitely worth watching and it's easy to overlook the age that of course means awful special effects and sometimes acting.
5,Great Movie,We always enjoyed a good drama movie that involves a complex and well presented plot. Red Dawn brings to the viewers the trials and difficult decisions that a group of teenagers must do in order to survive.
5,Red Dawn Video,This is a good movie with good actors. The story is shocking but not out of the realm of possibility.
4,"20 years later my views have changed on ""RED DAWN"".","Years ago I dismised RED DAWN as one of those agenda movies in the vain of the 1950's Invasion USA. Some of the writing is just plain heavy handed with popular jingos of the time. The invasion scenario while absurd was popular in intelligence and military circles at the time. The acting is slightly better than ""Summer stock"" with some notable exceptions and cameos. Powers Boothe for instants plays a fighter pliot turned Special Forces Adviser with conviction although his character is clearly a composite.Today and after the past ten years I revisted the film again and it ""dawned"" on me this movie is oddly about the 1980's Soviet-Afghan War. The Wolverines are clearly the Majahideen and thier tactics are almost textbook examples of guerrilla warfare."
3,"Its a good action movie, nothing more","Its just so dated now. This film struck a chord with American audiences because it put us on the recieving/defensive end of an invasion, a position we haven't played since the revolutionary war. Americans are rebels at heart, that's why we love films like Braveheart. The problem is we haven't been rebels for over 200 years and more often than not, these days we tend to be the ones invading.If you're able to sympathize and root for the Wolverines, than you should at least be able to understand, if not sympathize with, the position of the Vietnamese and Iraqi guerillas our boys fought against. Yes, the Wolverines do not attack their own the way the Iraqi insurgents do, but they did kill one of their own in cold blood when they found out he was bugged.I'm not a communist or Islamist sympathizer, just a relativist."
4,Very suspenseful,"When I first watch this movie I was poured into its suspenseful beginning. I was also impressed by the teenage boys especially girls vlalors. They sacrifice themselves for their nation, United States. They face difficulties but fortified their minds. Even though their outcomes were not actually manifested at the end of the story, we see how their love for country help their nation to be alive. It is a wonderful and rememberable movie."
2,Looses Something in the Translation,"All the gung-ho, red-blooded flag-wavers who love this movie should be aware of one pertinent fact: This film was a re-make of a film released in 1943 called ""North Star"". The orginal, made at the height of the Big One was about the heroic Russian partisans battling the Nasty Nazis in defense of their beloved Motherland.Ironic, no?Considered merely as an action film, it isn't bad. Plenty of things blowing up and gunfights. Seasoned with a spoonful of charachter development to help it all go down.But it's ultimate fate will be similar to that of the parent film--a relic of propaganda serving to mark a particular moment in time and space. Veiw it as an artifact only."
5,"Review of DVD ""Red Dawn""",We received the DVD we purchased in excellent shape and in a timely manner. We would definitely order products from this seller again. Thanks!
2,Lost a lot,"Like many, I remembered this as a cool movie. It's funny what we liked as teenagers in the 80s. It could've been a better movie with a slower, more developed beginning. The movie gets points for fairly successful drama, but lack of character development at the start and throughout the movie seriously dulls it. It also gets points for varied locales, from deserts to pine forests to snowscapes. Ultimately, it's hard to care for the characters or even the cause. I'm realizing that I liked it as a kid because it was voilent and every American boy's fantasy. Neither lure holds up for me today like it used to, much like the movie as a whole."
3,A Corny Classic,"The actors in this film went on to do greater work and this was a first film for many of them. The plot is pretty good, because they explain, that it's an alternate history. The acting was not very good, but it was a first for some of the best 80's actors."
2,Implausible at Best -,"Russian/Cuban forces in the 1980s parachute into a small Colorado town and begin eliminating the inhabitants. (Really - Russia would need/want Cuba's help, they'd start in a small town in Colorado and bother exterminating its populace?) Patric Swazye and friends grab a pickup truck, stock up on supplies, and head for the hills. Meanwhile, the town's remaining men are held at the local drive-in. Then the teens emerge as a vengeance-seeking commando unit known as 'Wolverines' and rescue the town from Communist occupation - after Washington, D.C. Kansas City, Omaha, etc. were already obliterated. Sometime later, the U.S. drives the invaders out, per the film's epilogue. Laughable.The 'good news' is that, per others, this version isn't as bad as its 2012 remake."
2,Dated and Poorly acted,"I didn't expect fireworks, but I was hoping for a reasonably interesting look at how Americans would stage their own resistance.Overall it was pretty disappointing.... They ""attack"" some russian ""armored columns"" with machine guns, and are successful? WTF? did the Russians forget they have freaking armored vehicles?The idea that these kids could hold their own is paltry to begin with and pathetic by the end.Then there's Charlie Sheen slipping into some lines that he looks all to comfortable saying, maybe a foreshadowing of things to come, like when he turns to one of the chicks while holding a dirty dish and says, ""here, make yourself useful and wash this"" HA!I understand this is a cult classic, but thankfully that cult must have all drank the kool-aid and is no longer around to try to push the idea that this is a good movie. Two stars because of the kid that turns into a psycho by the end. At least his character seemed like it belonged/"
4,A great 80's action/drama,"No doubt written by Reagan speechwriters, this anti-communist action film sometimes borders on the ridiculous, (Cuban soldiers spearheading an invasion of the U.S. followed by Russian paratroopers) but it is both enjoyable and, at times, clever (for example,there is a scene where a bumper sticker elicits the slogan ""You can have my gun when you pry it from my cold, dead hand"" followed by the camera panning over to a man's corpse holding a gun and a Russian soldier taking the gun out of his hand after having shot him.) At times, as far-fetched as the plot may seem, (especially in retrospect) this movie does stir good old-fashioned feelings of angry patriotism. This movie stands out as one of my favorite movies of the eighties. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10"
4,Loved it.,Watched it with my 13 year old son. He loved it too. We can't wait to see the remake thats in theaters now.
5,Jim Emerson's description is bigoted,"Please read the ""Editorial Reviews...Amazon.com...Jim Emerson"" and try to tell anyone that his purpose isn't to puke out his political views. Red Dawn is a great movie that history has proven is what DOES happen after foreign invasions. If the victim nation doesn't love the ""invader"" then 90% will whine about it, 10% will do something about it. In the case of Red Dawn, it happens to be some teenagers, just as teenagers everywhere are who typically join the military and defend their home. The movie is very realistic. ***I agree with other Reviews that most of the Reviewers never saw this movie... OR were daydreaming or texting someone and not paying attention.***"
5,Simply Awesome,Love this flick. One of my all time favorites. Me and my buddies saw it in the theater when it came out and it was awesome then and still is now. We always thought of what we would of done if that happened at our school. This movie has mega replay value. I watch it alot every year. It's in the top of my collection pile and you won't want to miss this one. I think this movie still stands strong for it's age. Definatley a must buy.
5,Awesome,"Classic movie, can't go wrong with a young chuck sheen and pat schwaze. Wolverines rule, Russians drool. Watch it again."
1,Oy Vey!,"I thought about giving this film an intellectual review, but that would have been a complete waste of time. Watching this film could be compared to listening to a C.W. McCall album with a bad case of nausea or perhaps something scatological. Simply pathetic. The only redeeming role was performed by William Smith, who was the ONLY actor who seemed to exhibit talent, putting Sheen and Swayze to shame as acting professionals. This film would only have value for students who are seriously studying Russian and at that would be applicable to Chapter 22 with Smith's ""I Am A Hunter"" speech. This film is a good example of how you can't win a game when only one person on the team shows up."
1,Sorry. They didn't make a ZERO available for me.,"""Red Dawn"" sucks. It's that simple. Unrealistic, comical, horrid acting, horrid script, comical depictions, cliches and stereotypes all come immediately to mind. I won't try to to come up with other adjectives for fear of wasting time. That military minds find this plausible is a scary indictment on our military. That some find this a quality movie with great acting is an indictment on our movie industry, which' thrives on a ""give them what they want"" mentality. Poor Lea Thompson. She has both this movie and ""Howard the Duck"" on the 80s section of her resume forever. And don't even get me started on Patrick Swayze, the Ted McGinley of his era. Don't believe the rave reviews posted by dimwits or right wingers who don't know quality film. This movie sucks. It's really that simple. I did my best to warn you to save you some time and money."
1,makes ya laugh.,"i'll just say this; anyone who likes/loves this movie more than likely took the 'pepsi challenge' seriously. i gave it one star for the comedic input that i enjoy mocking. Oh well, this film can be summed up the best by ol' ronald reagan's greatest quote from the 1990's: ""what the hell is this! who the hell are you, what am i doing? """
4,SOVIET INVASION of The United States,"This movie is one of my favorite War movies, the first move that depicts a World War on ""American Soil"". I thought the Action was good and well directed. When I first saw it, it made me think, was it possible for my Country to be Invaded by the USSR and it's Allies, where the west was under Soviet Control. I do think though, the US would have better defense that would have prevented them from invading. overall it was a good action movie with a good plot."
3,2012 Remake is Better,"Interesting premise, but little plot. The characters are never fully developed. No hint of Dirty Dancing. Realistic ending but wished there was more development."
4,Great 80s movie,"When the new Red Dawn came out she hadnt seen it so we ordered this one. I remember this movie from when I was younger, it was terrifying , still great. I like how the commies used the gun registration records to find the law abidiing citizens who had guns and kill them. It really speaks volumes to why records of gun ownership should NEVER BE KEPT."
5,Red Dawn is a classic that no home should be without!,"For me, this movie is a classic. When it originaly came out it was on VHS but now that I have a big screen , HD TV, I decided to update. It looks even better in HD. A whole generation has grown up since this first came out. Do your younger friends a favor and show them this timeless story of a bunch of high school mates who band together to fight an invading Russian and Cuban army."
1,Why make a Blu-ray disk if it's not going to be in 5.1 surround???,If you want to own your own copy of this great classic... save some money and get the regular DVD. Blu-ray adds NOTHING to the movie! The picture quality is still that of an 80's movie and it's still in 2.0 stereo surround.
4,good,this movie is better than the new one. got this because i enjoy it and to prove my point to a friend.
4,Dumb editorial review,"I don't know who led off with your Editorial Review (just below the product information) but I don't think it's very smart to trash a movie, beliefs and lifestyle that many of your customeres consider almost iconic. Red Dawn was a stark and in many ways very realistic view of something my generation grew up with, the real threat of WWIII. The movie also ties into the imagination and feelings of young people who grew up under this nuclear cloud. Would I have gone to the hills and fought an invader, you bet I would have, and most of the people I grew up with would have too! As far as trashing the second amendment. I defy your reviewer to look at any other historical example of a country moving in that direction that hasn't resulted in an oppressed citizenship or outright facism. I would hope your product presentation people would be a little more careful in the future about how they lead into product information..."
4,Maybe some have forgotten it's original broadcast ...,"This movie was first seen on television, not in theaters. I remember its original broadcast well, a large family gathering around the TV watching a movie that really scared the hell out of us. Because we did think such a scenario possible some day. Current events have shown us that things we never thought could happen CAN indeed happen. That has sparked new interest in this movie, and whether it's dated or not, it still presents a chilling picture of what could happen. No, a bunch of kids alone didn't ""save the world"" or anything ... it's more realistic than that. I recommend the movie."
3,"Jim Emerson, leftist reviewer extraordinaire!","I liked the movie very much, as I believe it is okay to be patriotic and fly the flag. Where did this Jim Emerson come from? Do we have to be subjected to reviews by far-left-leaning, gun-hating, anti-Reagan Liberals? I realize reviews are subjective, but I don't care to be bludgeoned with someone's political views such as I felt I was with Mr. Emerson's review."
4,Only for 3th world war obsessed people,"one of the Patric Swayze's first movies, about a rusian invation to USA and how the american people try to survive, a classic of the 80's."
2,"I loved this in 1984, but ....","But then I was a snot-nosed kid in high school who just loved shoot-em-ups with interesting plots.It is true ... with age comes wisdom ... having watched this now, I am appalled at the stereotypes, the unabashed patriotism, and the ridiculous scenarios the teenagers find themselves in and get themselves out of with ease."
2,"""AVENGE MEEEE! ""","The fact that this ludicrous film was made without a hint of irony is what makes it so hilarious. Favorite scenes: a) the shot of the ""They can take my gun when they pry it from my dead, cold fingers"" bumpersticker, then the pan down to the Russian soldier prying it from an American's cold, dead fingers. Awesome! b) when the boys visit their pop Harry Dean Stanton at the ""re-education"" camp. Swayze drawls, ""Dad...Ah luv ewww!"" and macho Harry Dean says, ""don't ever cry again as long as you live...AVENGE ME!"" c)Swayze intones gravely, ""Don't cry...let it turn to something else...none of us will ever get to go home again, ever."" What? When the war ends, go home! And why the hell would a huge army division occupy a little town that doesn't seem to have any strategic value whatsoever? How many troops did they have? A million? There's much absurdity to laugh at in this one."
1,Jesus Mary Joseph...,"... unrelentingly poor. The premise is instantly shot to buggery as we are expected to imagine a large-scale Soviet invasion via the Bering Strait. Then we are given to understand that the fiendish Ivans have pincered Denver with the help of Cuba and Nicaragua. Credibility is as thin on the ground elsewhere in this wreck. All characters, both goodies and the baddies, are caricatures, the acting is comically poor, the political message about as subtle as a kick in the bollocks.I'm as pro-gun as any European can be and a rabid nationalist to boot; you don't have to be a bed-wetting crypto to acknowledge the extreme crappiness of this piece of Eighties high camp. When will the Yanks realise WWIII is not something to be romanticised. I'll stick to 'Threads'."
1,unfunny,"there hasn't been a piece of neo-fascist agitprop this psychotic or lame brained since jack webb. the dialog is cliched tripe, the dramatic structure is crude and forced, and the acting is hopeless. but probably the most incredible part of this film is not its narrative inconsistencies and contradictions, or even its technical incompetence, but the fact that some people took this reactionary jingoist drivel for a sincere appeal to patriotism. there were those who found this movie funny, and for the demented, I suppose it is--but not for long. the unintentional humor evaporates more quickly than a dry ice cube in a napalm strike. i suppose you could look at this film as camp, but only if you feel the same way about `triumph of the will', or if your sense of humor is on par with hannibal lecter."
1,Were they serious?,"Without question, probably the silliest piece of dreck I've sat through in a long time. Never mind the terrible overacting, the lack of script, or the tedious sameness of the ""action."" Where is even the remotest sense of credibility? A fantasy movie like this is supposed to make you at least almost sort of believe it coulda, woulda, mighta happened. This one, no. Where is the rest of the ginormous US military? I suppose it was off fighting elsewhere, as we are led to believe by the gap-filling dialogue delivered about halfway into the movie by the shot-down American pilot. The sets are just too fake. The bazookas too unreal. The Rooskies and the others too stereotyped. It is a hoot to watch these very young future stars ""acting"" in this mess. Give it a laugh, if you must."
1,Can't belive I spent my hard earned money on this!!!,"I bought this DVD as a Christmas gift for my husband. We live in Virginia, in the U.S.A. And when we went to play his new movie it said Region Error. So evidentally Amazon sold us a movie that can only be played in Europe. WOW!"
2,One of the worst well known films,How did I survive so many years without seeing this film? Easily; it's laughably terrible.Two stars because it's almost worth watching to laugh at.
1,Garbage,"Boggles my mind how someone could possibly give this 5 stars. Poorly written, poorly directed, and for the most part poorly acted. Utter drivel."
2,farce,"This movie was moronic. The Red Army is no match for a small group of dim witted teenagers?!? Gimme a break! This movie was chock full of utter nonsense. It was not believable nor did it suspend my disbelief which is the fundamental rule in movie making. Instead it called attention to itself at every turn with conspicuous exposition, horrid acting, and bad dialogue. A screwball from the past like this will normally have some comedic value but this one did not. I give it 1.5 stars."
1,Can't play it from my iPad / iPhone to my TV,"I paid for this via the Amazon video app for iPad. Was bummed to find out that I couldn't 1) Stream the video to my AppleTV. 2) Couldn't play it on my TV using the Apple HDMI cable. Sooooo, it looks like if a video is rented via that app, you are gonna be watching it on the iPad and not a bigger screen, FYI."
2,Loony and paranoid,"A Russian leader told this to Reagan; ""We have no plans whatsoever to invade the United States. While if our armies got there, we could certainly take over major cities quickly, we'd face unending opposition to this move for generations. And, why should we do it? Communism, if it comes to America, must be from within, we can't force it. On the other hand, we are afraid of America trying this on Russia. Simply put, a small army taking over Moscow could do the trick. Like a virus taking over a cell. Orders would come from central and that would be that."""
5,Any true American would be moved by this movie.,"Small town America becomes the center of WWIII. A group of high school students end up using gorllia warfare tatics to defend the country they all love. It is a very emotional movie that will make you appreciate what you have and what others have given for this country. The plot of an invasion is some what unrealistic, just remember it's a movie and anything is possible......."
2,This was not a great movie,"It was predictable (obviously) but the worst part was the dialogue, it was dry and uninspired.If you don't like watching people cry and scream it's not your thing."
1,"Stupid ,inane and banal","I was not very old when I first saw this piece of Hollywood garbage and was led to wonder just how this truly STUPID piece of sh!t made it past the pre production process.There is a term called verisimilitude,which loosely translated,means ""willing suspension of disbelief"".I would have had to be sniffing isobutyl alcohol for an extended period of time,to even to come close to believing any part of this dumpster dive of a movie.I've gotten more amusement from watching peanuts float in the commode after a good bowel movement."
1,Craptastic!!!!,"Jingoistic exploitation of over the top Cold War paranoia. I.E.... a movie that relied on the emotional fears of the times. This movie failed at the box office because it's projected fear had logic problems. If you can accept the premise then the movie will work. But to the average watcher the view point is dated. When I saw it, I felt it was the best comedy of the year. For sheer Ed Wood Plan 9 from outer space entertainment?... This movie is KING. It's a five star flop. Loads of bad dialogue and over the top scenes with sweeping music. It's ripe for Mystery Science Theater 3000 to lampoon."
1,"An awful, terrible movie -- NO MATTER WHAT YOUR POLITICS ARE!","Just like Farenheit 9/11 is a despicable, demagogic movie of the left, so too is Red Dawn on the right.I will say one good thing about this movie, in contrast to the ultra-boring Farenheit 9/11: the story of how six meat-eating, gun-toting, Ronald Reagan-supporting high school kids camp out in the Rockies and eventually save America from the Ruskies is hilariously entertaining, no matter how stupid.It's no stretch to say this is Patrick Swayze's finest role ever."
2,True?,"This movie is about a battle that took place, from what I can gather, sometime between Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War I. It is about Cuban insurgents that infiltrate a strategic town somewhere in the Rocky mountains. The Soviet Union joins the Cubans to fortify the town which is seemingly unreachable by the American military due to it's logistics. A few fresh faced kids battle the insurgency but ultimately fail in the end. This movie seemed to glorify the actual event which gets little if any mention in historical texts."
5,vintage 80s is back in style!,"this movie holds up as well today as it did in 1984. the first time i saw this was in my 8th grade history class. when i got my first vcr years later, this was one of the fist movies i purchased.the blu-ray transfer was done pretty well and the sound is on par with the picture. there is some grain on the image, but that's to be expected with a 30+ year old movie. unless a complete 4k scan is done, you can expect some grain from older movies. and while the sound is comparable to the image, there are tells that it isn't one of today's big hollywood blockbusters.with all of that said, i still recommend this movie to any action movie fan or any fan of cool 80s flicks.i haven't seen the remake, so i won't compare this one to that one or that one to this one."
3,Get out your popcorn and don't choke on the kernels!,"Back when there was a Soviet Union they get together with the Cubans to invade the U.S.A. Unfortunatly for them they chose to drop-in on one of the highest points in the world. The commies pick the wrong town to start their invasion. Here we find benevolent but defiant parents and the fiercest set of patriotic teenagers called wolverines; they will attempt to defend and free the country from the dastardly invaders. As we hear every cliche and see all the pitfalls, we get to kibitz.Don't ask if an innovation can take place. It has. Now what are you going to do about it? Relatives shot, friends turned traitor, and outgunned, don't let that stop you."
3,Memorable Film,"The DVD could use a few extras considering the importance of this film to the time period it was released. I love this film. It was one of the first PG-13 films ever released, if not the first, and I was 11 years old when it came out. I actually remember trying to act 13 to get in. The scene which has always stuck in my mind the most is toward the beginning when the Russian/Cuban paratroopers decend on the high school and the History Teacher (discussing Genghis Kan) naively walks out to greet them. A very fascinating image of beauty and brutality. I think the film had a great concept and although I found the ending to lose a bit of the excitement the beginning held, it still goes down as one of my most memorable films of the 1980's."
5,movie review,This was a great action movie and could possibly happen as the United States likes to think that they are untouchable and are the police of the world.
2,Not horrible,It was ok for an old movie but next time kill the kid whos crying all the time. Still haven't seen the new version.
3,Good for an old Cold War movie.,"Classic ""Commies are coming"" video with lots of action but it makes one wonder if high school kids today are willing to fight and die for anything. Times have changed."
2,Fairy tale,"Appeals to the apocalyptic crowd, but totally unbelievable. Ordinarily I can get into a fairy tale, but these guys are ridiculous. The Ruskis and Cubans are smart enough to invade the USA, but too dumb to find five teenagers?"
3,Good Movie,Good acting and storyline.Good action movie for a cold winter day when youhave to stay inside. Grab some popcorn and a sodaand you're all set.
3,Great movie,The only problem is not having subtitles when they are speaking a language other than English in the movie. The only option I could find was to have the subtitles on all the time.
2,Was This Meant As A Comedy?,"I can't believe that anyone ever took this film seriously. I give it two stars simply because it really defines and illustrates the paranoia and ""red scare"" mentality of the Reagan era."
2,ONE OF THE MOST DEPRESSING MOVIES EVER MADE,"The anti-communist,Pro-American stand in this movie is admirable, however, with nearly everyone dying in this movie, it made it a little hard to follow. Lord of the Rings meets World War III. One of the only redeeming values are the performances by Powers Boothe as the pilot and of course Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey, who are two of my favorite actresses. They do not make up for the oppressive undertones and depressing storyline."
2,Not as good as I remembered ...,"Got it to watch with my boys prior to seeing the new version just released. Quality was so so - pixelated, acting was poor.Hrd to remember why I loved it so as a teen."
5,litmus test,"I liked this movie in the 80's, and it is still good!! The same people who hated republicans and the second amendment then hate this movie now. It is a real litmus test for political view. The situations are reversed on ""Coming Home"" with Hanoi Jane."
1,Cleaning no more ...,"I purchased the Hoover U6616-900 Wind Tunnel Self Propelled Bagless Upright from Target 5 weeks ago. It had been working well until today. Now I have lost all suction. When I went to clean out the area listed in the directions, there is a piece of hard plastic that prevents the dirt from being taken into the machine. I have taken off all parts that could get me to a clog--no success. Anyone have any advice?? My son gets married on Saturday and this is NOT the week I need my vacuum to go out.Jan"
1,DO NOT BUY,"I previously reviewed this product and had nothing but great things to say about it. My opinion has now changed, after owning it for a few months I have had nothing but problems. The first thing to break was the self propel. Then the on and off switch quit working, it just stays on, to turn it off you have to unplug it. Now, it keeps throwing the circuit breaker to my house when you plug it in(brand new house). It is still under warranty, but Hoover says that I have to take it in, and they will only pay the bill if it is their fault. I don't want to take the chance in what they preceive is their fault. This vacuum cleaner should be recalled, I can not imagine it is very safe if it will not even turn off. I just threw away alot of money, and now have to go buy a new vacuum cleaner."
4,Cleans Carpet very well,"I just bought one of these and I think it does a great job cleaning deep carpet. I always see a scary amount of dirt, hair, dust, etc in the chamber when I am done just one cleaning session! I clean the filter out every two weeks by dumping the chamber and pulling out the HEPA filter and tapping it against something outside. You should see the dust and stuff that comes out of that filter after only one use. The final stage filter has yet to even start getting dirty, so apparently nothing is getting through the HEPA. I'm a clean fanatic and it makes me happy. It is a little heavy and unweildy though, so not for the elderly or weak. The rotating brush attachment is nice for furniture and stairs. It has a yaw to the left for some reason, I assume because the suction is so strong. Definitely worth the koney and gives a good, safe cleaning."
1,awful,"Changing the canister (which you have to do once for every large room) is a messy undertaking. Even if you're careful, dust and dirt slide out with the canister - dropping a mess onto the floor you just had to roll the Hoover WindTunnel over several times to get ""clean."" What a waste of money!"
3,Bring Back the Bags,"This is a very powerful vacuum - it picks up virtually everything from the carpet. We had the old Wind Tunnel which although heavy and cumbersome, cleaned very well for 5 years. (It still works but overheats sometimes and automatically shuts off).We had this for one week and the belt just broke. The previous reviewer was right!Also this bagless system is just too much trouble. Every time you vacuum you need to empty it. Dust flies everywhere, it just defeats the purpose. The bag was a much cleaner system. Simple and convenient. With a household of six (five males) its got to be quick, clean and effective. I don't mind the weightlifting so much but what's the point of a HEPA filter if everytime you empty the canister dust flies everywhere."
3,Suction doesn't last,I've had the vacuum for about 6 months and like the self propelled feature but hate having to empty the canister. The suction is strong to start but fades as the canister fills and the filter clogs. Emptying the vacuum is a dirty job. If I had to do it over again I'd buy a dyson or a vacuum with a bag.
3,"Really picks up dog hair, but","the first time I emptied the dust cup, a piece fell out I could not find where to put it back. The self propelled feature works only part of the time and is really hard to turn on and off. I have had it for two months now and would return it if I could. The great feature is the hand held power head, cleans the dog hair off the furniture easily."
4,"Works well, but it's huge","I bought this vacuum because the reviews were good and I wanted a vacuum that would work well and last a long time. I was surprised how big it was when it arrived--very awkward to carry the box up to my 4th floor apartment. The first thing I did with it was to vacuum the area rug in my living room. The amount of cat hair and dust that it picked up was amazing--I was serioiusly &quot;grossed out&quot; by the amount of stuff in the container. The problem with this vacuum is that it is just so big and heavy. I live in a city apartment with hardwood floors and I have alot of furniture and &quot;stuff&quot; everywhere because I don't have any storage. This vacuum doesn't fit under the bed, under furntiture, around stuff. I've decided to return it and get a canister instead (probably a Hoover windtunnel)."
2,If only it vacuumed,"This has to be one of the poorest performing vacuum cleaners I've ever used. I finally ponied up the money and bought a Dyson. What led to that was a small spill of shreds from my paper shredder onto a shag carpet in my home office. The Hoover picked up about half of it. The rest of the paper shreds it spread around, bury some shreds further into the shag. It doesn't help that the hose has barely any suction at all. That was the breaking point. Yes, I've tried every setting, went to the web for advice. It's just a bad product. I sold it off for $2 at my garage sale - I just couldn't pawn it off on someone as if it actually worked. The buyer said they thought they could make some modifications."
1,Nothing works right,"The on-off switch did not work properly because its internal workings are plastic and do not fit perfectly. If the handle is not tightly connected to the body, the switch does not work. I took this to a dealer repair shop where it would work there but as soon as I brought it home it stopped after a few times. The propeller switch broke. Finally the the beater brush switch stopped working. The reliability and workmanship is terrible. I have had it for about a year and got it as a gift."
1,***Horrible DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!,"I am so irritated with this vacuum. It only worked well the first time I used it. After that it was one problem after another. Every part on this vacuum has broken, and now it wont work at all and its only a year old. I am so mad after researching and spending the money, now I have to find another vacuum. Whatever you do DON'T BUY THIS ONE!!!"
1,Breaks easily. Expensive to repair. Buy something else!,"I bought this vacuum new and used it three times. For those three times, it worked like a dream. Never had the carpet been so clean. It even looked like a professional carpet cleaner had just visited.On the fourth use, the brush abruptly stopped rolling and the motor started smoking. It cost me over $100 to repair. Beware buying this vacuum; repair shop owners will laugh at you when you bring it in because they see so many of them with broken belts and motors. Ignore what consumer reports says on this one and most definitley do not throw your money away on this piece of junk. It would be cheaper and easier to have your carpets professionally cleaned."
5,We LIKE to vacuum???,"After wrestling with heavvy Kirbys for 25 years, we find the Hoover WindTunnel self-propelled bagless vacuum a pleasure to operate and it cleans, cleans, cleans! We recently lost our beautiful black standard poodle and while it's mostly true poodles don't shed, we groomed her and there was some hair in the carpet. We had vacuumed twice after her death but could not believe the amount of hair, fluff and dirt picked up by the WindTunnel the first time we used it. Our carpets are so much more resiliant (clean!) and the Hoover is so easy to move when not in use (just put the handle in upright and tilt up the front wheels). The attachments are easy to use, we especially like the upholstery brush. My husband has a pulmonary problem and we believe WindTunnel vacuum and the Hoover Agility steam vac, which we also purchased, will help him. We recommend both of them for the household that cherishes clean!"
1,Disappointed in the Wind Tunnel,"This vacuum is SO heavy. Also, you have to attach the wand each time you want to use it (can't just grab and use). It has a strong suction, which makes it hard to move forward or backward. Have to keep changing settings to find one that will work for various rugs. Finally, it chewed up one of my rugs today. So I definately would recommend looking elsewhere!"
1,You get what you pay for,"This net rotted out in less than 6 months. It is nylon,as was my last net, but my last net lasted a couple of years. This net completely disintrigrated. I will go with a metal chain net."
1,Look too old and uncomfortable,I return this iteam right away when I just tried it on...it totally hurt my toes b/c the head is narrow so it made my toes really hurt.
5,LESSONS FOR A LIFETIME,Lessons that will last a lifetime are found in Cabbages and Kings by Elizabeth Seabrook.Glowingly illustrated by Jamie Wyeth this narrative relates the happy results of an unexpected friendship
2,"Too spacious, off tempos, not pure enough for this concerto","I LOVE Beethoven's violin concerto, and seeing this CD with a great conductor, a great violinist, and a great orchestra, I thought it would be a good performance. Wrong! Zukerman's tempos are so terrible. Just listen to lazy solos at the beginning of the third movement. Barenboim's conducting doesn't help either, sounds too large and bombastic, even violent. One music critic said the violin sounds like it has ""fat"" on it. Well, I wouldn't go that far, but it doesn't sound refined and pure enough for Beethoven's concerto. I would recommend Itzhak Perlman's recording with Giulini on EMI, it has better-judged tempos, better conducting and orchestral accompaniment, more beauty, and more refined technique. In fact, it's the best version I have ever heard, so much more beautiful than the Zukerman recording. As for Zukerman, his performances of the Romances aren't bad, but I can't stand his solos in the violin concerto."
1,Didn't last a month,"This microwave just died within a month. No explaination, just stopped working. Otherwise, it was a fine microwave, but not worth the cost of TWO microwaves. I won't be buying another Emerson."
4,Aloha from a real person,This book explores the different qualities that are emulated in traditional Hawaiian values. It contains some very interesting history plus a fascinating personal story from the author. It is a very lovely expression of Hawaii and Aloha. Contains a nice glossary of words and famous Hawaiians. I got a lot out of this book.
2,Not what I expected,I wanted to learn the practical way of HoOponppono. This did not meet my expectation. I would have liked to learn more about how people practice this in modern times.
4,Tim Burton Triple Feature - what can you say?,Tim Burton definitely has a different way of looking at the world - and you can see this in these three movies!! The Blu-ray Transfer looks good and you can't go wrong with these three movies for $10 (which is what I paid at the time). Three good movies on blu-ray for $3.33 a piece?? No brainer!
4,Played Wonderfully,I recommend people to buy this copy. It has three movies at the price of one and they play wonderful in the blue-ray players. The sound is also wonderful.
1,Not happy with this purchase,"I was very excited for this item to arrive. But alas, the first day I put it on, I only had it on for about an hour or so and while I was leaning on my kitchen table, the metal part of the bracelet snapped. I also think the picture is misleading. The red cord is very thin, not as thick as pictured, and neither is the metal hamsa, it's thin as well. It's very cheap looking for the money you're going to shell out. I'd move along."
5,Great bracelet!,I bought this bracelet over 6 months ago and have been wearing it since. It has held up very well and looks great when mixed with multiple bracelets and bangles like the movie stars wear.
5,This CD is a great start of every day. God Bless!,This CD is really a blessing and inspiration. I borrowed it from a co-worker and he had to plead to get it back. I couldn't wait to get my own copy.
3,Brian Auger's Oblivion Express,"good band, music sounds a bit dated, not as fresh as some of their live performances"
1,Lasko fan,"I purchased this fan about 2 1/2 months ago and it just stopped working, no smoke smell, no spark from it, no nothing...? What a piece of crap for the money!!! I would nt buy this fan unless your buying it for a paper weight, what a waste of money !!! Waiting on a reply from the vender to see what they have in store for me !! I hope its not another ""your up ____ creek without a paddle"" like ive heard about!!!!"
3,Wallmount fan,"The fan is lightweight, and was very easy to put together. The fan is mounted in a very small room, so this is a perfect solution for a room with limited space. My only complaint is that it's not as quiet as I would like. Otherwise, a good buy."
3,A few great performances buried in here,"Pros- great live performances by Buddy Guy, JB Hutto and John Lewis- interesting Muddy Waters interview and partial performance- Maxwell Street footage- Bonus Material: voice over commentary by filmmakers (it was great this is included; provides context)Cons- Socio-Political oriented agenda overwhelms the editing, narration (eg, a lot of shots of gritty urban Chicago c.1970, many times editied into a live performance by a great musician)- Grainy visuals (hey this footage is 40 years old)- Bonus Material: voice over commentary by filmmakers (put me to sleep in spots)"
2,Comes to life only at the end,"The ending is extremely subtle and clever. Too bad the film leading up to that is largely slow and dreary -- about a number of people with unhappy love lives. The only signs of life come from the guy's assistant and his boss. Acting by all is pretty good -- considering.Some people have mistakingly called this a remake ofYOU'VE GOT MAIL(which is a remake ofSHOP AROUND THE CORNERandIN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME). It isn't. The main characters in both films communicate via the internet (email in the American film, instant messaging in the Korean film). But otherwise, the plot is entirely different."
3,Rainbow quest -Clancy Brothers& TMakem+Mamou Cajun Band,"I've always been a big fan of the Clancy's and Pete Seeger. Whilst this production is good, it is not up to their normal high standards. At the start of the show, Pete Seeger explained that his throat was hoarse and he couldn't sing so he called his friends the Clancy's at the last minute. They appeared minus Patrick Clancy and did a workman like job. Then Tom Paxton came on and that segment was a little better as there was more interaction. Seeger's throat apparently was ok by performance time but the crux of the show is the crossover interactions and song swapping that Seeger usually does with his guests. The second show had the Mamou Cajun band employing the old time high pitched virtually incomprehensable singing even if one knows Cajun French. The musicianship was good but somehow the interactions and the chemistry just came up a bit short. Again both programmes are good and worth buying but just not the best ones of the series"
3,Fun to watch,"This is not a great video, but for an old dyed-in-the-wool fanof the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, it was fun to watch.Perhaps it was a little painful, too, to see them over the distance of time, before they developed the fine edge to theirperformances. Still, I'll take what I can find but their performance was way too short.The cajun music was okay. I enjoy that genre but, again, theband was obviously not used to being televised.You might enjoy this if you keep the time and experience factorin mind."
3,Irish & Cajun? Maybe,"You'd have to be very 'catholic' in your musical tastes to pair these two genres on one DVD or, as no doubt was the case, there were only so many shows to reissue. And there you are!The Clancy Bros. & Tommy Makem segment was OK, EXCEPT that Tommy Clancy was not present; with no explanation.The Mamou Cajun Band was INTERESTING.Vintage videos of the Clancy Bros. & Tommy Makem are not common; so this could be a ""Must Have"", as it was for me."
3,"OK, not quite as I expected.","Most of this book is descriptions of how to position yourself for the poses, which are difficult to follow if you've never done or seen or have had Yoga explained to you. I have the Kindle version, and find it very hard to flip back and forth on the pages in order to check and see if I'm doing the poses right.Very poor descriptions of how to put the poses together into a workout routing."
3,Too advanced,I'm 73 and it's too advanced for me. I'm pretty active. They won't let me submit without 3 more words so here you are.
4,"Not what I expected, but good for what it is.","I suppose it's my fault, what I really needed was 'yoga for 70+' to help me with the Gentle Yoga class I teach.This book doesn't really address the age-related concerns I run into with my older students, like how to work around hip replacements and osteoporosis, what to substitute for inversions when a student has glaucoma, etc. But, like I said, my students are well over age 50 (I'm nearly 50 myself) so it's my fault for expecting too much.The poses and prop variations it teaches are what I use in all my classes for less-flexible students of all ages. From that perspective, though, it's a fine book with clear instruction & illustration."
1,Not worth it.,"I can honestly say i'm very disappointed with this book. I expected to actually learn more about about poses (especially for the elderly) As a yoga instructor myself i found this book to be horrible i would never recommend it for a beginner. Yes, the poses are for beginners but what the book fails to do is explain these poses, and what prep poses to do. Not once did the book mention the four points of contact on the foot to help with balance it fails to remind the reader to make sure there archs are not collapsing, it lacks tellin readers about the common mistakes that are done in certain poses. I would not recommend it if you are a beginner or a yoga instructor, searchin for modiifications."
5,Excellent for someone starting out or want to maintain a yoga exercise regimen at home.,Excellent yoga stretching poses and techinques for someone starting out or want to maintain a yoga regimen at home. Great photos exhibiting the poses and how to do them. I highly recommend the book for anyone trying to include yoga streching exercises into their exercise routine or as a enhancer to a yoga class.
4,Very good recording,"We're singing this mass in SSA version in January, so I like to have a pro version to get the feel of it. This one is very well done, nicely recorded too, though SATB."
5,Secret history exposed!!,"This thoroughly researched and well written book ties together the threads of the Communist Revolution in China, the post WWII development of the atomic bomb in the USSR and the Chinese invasion of Tibet. Although much of the information is still classified, it is interesting to read about what the CIA knew, when they knew it, and, most interestingly, what they did or didn't do with the information. Laird does a masterful job of weaving information gleaned from previously classified information and interviews with persons as diverse as former CIA agents to His Holiness The Dalai Lama."
5,Excellent Adventure Book,"I thought this was a great adventure narrative, but it also included the political perspective as well. I had the pleasure of meeting the author in New Orleans and he has written a wonderful book. Buy it today."
4,"Christmas, Midnight","Most of the Christmas albums we have could be labeled either ""Christmas Party"" or ""Christmas Morning."" Grover Washington jr.'s ""Breath of Heaven"" is perhaps the only one that can be labeled ""Christmas, Midnight."" It evokes that quiet time after everyone has gone to bed, snowflakes silently padding the ground, and you, alone with...Enjoy."
4,Great Holiday Collection,One of my favorites. Grover at his best for the holidays! Perfect back drop music for a small gathering we for the holiday.
1,This is Christmas music?,"This has to be one of the most uninspirational and unenjoyable Christmas collections ever. Aside from the two tracks of ""Breath of Heaven,"" the CD is filled with really horrible arrangements of some wonderful Christmas songs. We didn't even recognize ""I Wonder as I Wander."" Grover, go back to the drawing board on this one!"
5,Brilliant album,This is one of my very favorite albums. It is a fantastic album by the brillint songwriter. The only drawback is that the CD would benefit from being digitally remastered.
4,Something For Everyone,"So what's a 48 year-old, middleclass white guy doing listening to this CD? Having a ball, that's what! Like one of the other online reviewers, I saw Imani on Sessions at West 54th. I was blown away by the creativity and joy of her music, and her totally unaffected performance style. I ran out and bought Chupacabra and have played it extensively. In my humble opinion, there isn't a clinker in the whole CD. Her mix of hip hop, jazz, and samples from folks like the Doors and Donovan is a gas, while her lyrics are smart and funny. This is great summer music with a really funky urban vibe -- something one appreciates when living in Boise, Idaho! Imani, I'm a fan!"
5,Like listening to spring!,"Everytime I listen to this CD, the flowers bloom and the grass grows greener! I originally bought it for ""Legend of a Cowgirl"", but I fell in love with all the songs, especially ""I Like It"" and ""Karma and the Blizzard"". If Imani ever does a show in Montreal, she can count on my being there! Keep at it Imani, you're truly great!"
4,"1, 2, 3, & 8 are my faves","Imani Coppola is one of THE most overlooked artists. Ever. But this is still a good debut, with the exception of ""My Day At the Ocean"", which is creepy. The other songs, especially tracks 1, 2, 3, & 8 are wonderfully lighthearted. Pigeon Penelope may be confusing at first, because it's hard to tell who's telling the story: Ms Coppola or some pigeon named Penelope. The song is just silly, along with I'm A Tree. Buy it; it's a good album to have on your iPod. BTW, does anyone know if the CD-Single for ""I'm A Tree"" is promo-only? I desperately want to hear the Tom Lord-Alge & Soul Kitchen remixes."
1,This Sucks Alright,I don't how anyone could give this album more than 1 star. This CD was a complete mess. Didn't Imani even bother to listen to it before it was put in the stores? I don't know how anyone could listen to this mess. This was awful. Absolutely awful. The girl can't sing or rap. She's better off playing her violin and being a background singer.
5,Hear The Rest!,"Yes, you've heard ""Legend of a Cowgirl"", now hear the rest. As usual with Pop Music and MTV, the 'pop' song they play does not hold a candle to the rest. Now, I do love ""Legend"", but believe it or not, that is the weakest song of the lot. Now THAT is saying something! Imani -- Where Are You?! Please allow us another album!! If you liked ""Legend"", do yourself (and Imani) a favor and purchase this album. I promise you... you will NOT be dissapointed, other than to know there is no other album to purchase. Maybe one day.... soon...."
5,Mega diva in the making.,"I never heard of Imani Coppola, until I saw her on Sessions at 54th. It was a like watching ""Digible Planets"" with a solo performer. This chick is bad! I know that she will definitely be a force in the music industry. It would be nice to hear contemporary versions of ""Sarah Vaughn"", ""Nancy Wilson"", and ""Dinah Washington's"" memorable hits, with this young diva's voice. I know that would be something see. I'm definitely looking forward to her next recording."
5,Imani,"Funky Imani Coppola does her own thing on her debut...Standout tracks are ""I'm a Tree, Pigeon Penelope, La da da, & of course the single that charted #16 ""Ledgend Of A Cowgirl."" She has grown as an artist on her (unreleased) new album ""Post Pop Tramatic Syndrome"" with great songs like ""Shot My Lover"" & ""Woodstock,"" & the first single written about the way of the world ""Prayer,"" this time around she delivers less of a rap & more of a song...she does kick back into her (Digable Planets) style of rapping though with ""Cool Beats In My Feet."" Highly recommend both cd's!"
4,Brigitte Looks Fabulous!,"While the story is a bit odd, it is interesting. The film is very stylish and Brigitte looks absolutely fabulous! Besides, it is better than most of what Hollywood dishes out even today. But, I suppose having the gorgeous Brigitte grace our TV screens for a couple hours just isn't enough for some critics. It certainly works for me!"
4,Classic Bardot!!!,"This is the Bardot I love! Captured within Classic early seventie's stylings, But they never Eclipse her great aura. Cool story of sexual domination, and it's inevitable destuction. Directed with a surprisingly steady hand of Roger Vadim. Stylish clothes, sexy french locales, even a prophetic mention of how computers will enhance our lives. Pick it up before it disappears like all great Foreign films/DVDs!"
2,Brigitte Bardot nude,Brigette Bardot is the only reason to see this movie. Without her this movie wouldn't be anything at all.
3,How Undemanding Are You?,"Bardot confesses to her cousin that she has killed, and driven men to destruction - he's a priest. Roger Vadim's best period as a director was clearly the sixties, when his empty pretentiousness was unquestionenly accepted. During the slightly more cynical seventies people saw through him, and as an artist, he floundered. I like his sixties stuff, I find it imensly entertaining - but it is hollow. This film, Don Juan.... is merely embarrasing. You do get a rare glimpse of Bridget in the buff (a rarity in her films), but it not worth, it's not salacious enough. And she looks a tad past it as well. She retired from the screen after this mess."
1,Waste of money,"I agree with all the other reviewers here. This was a waste of money. After installing it on my phone, there was no change in the service. There's a dead zone that almost drops our calls when we go through there. Well, having the antenna booster on my phone didn't change that."
1,worthless,i have a krazr from verizon and all this thing did was make my signal drasticaly worse. it could be the phone design for why this isnt working but ill never buy another one.
1,It Came Free,The only reason I got mine was because it came free with my screen protectors and I noticed it was cheaper than just getting the screen protectors themselves. The package looks cheap so I don't expect it to be anything but that.
5,"Vivacious, with elegant playng -- one of Ozawa's best","As a Boston regular and a non-fan of Ozawa's, I'm surprised to report that this gorgeously played Nutcracker from 1990 is among his real successes on disc. He led a bloodless and bland Swan Lake, but here is one of the more committed readings of the socre I'vve heard. DG provides full, warm side if rather lacking in inner detail, and the BSO is in top form -- I doubt the score has ever been better played on disc. The approach is definitely symphonic -- it lacks the dancing rhythms of Zinman's 1993 version with the NY City Ballet Orch. -- but I reveled in the plushness. The filler is the usual Suite of five numbers from Sleeping Beauty. Recommended even to Ozawa skeptics."
2,I don't think it is so good.,"3 stars is enough.Seiji gave us no thrilling,no enthusiamus.And the sound seems too dry.No soundeffect is added,so the whole recording is flat and dull.I really regret having bought it."
1,The truth about gustavo cisneros,"This person is allied with the dictador chavez. He is a traidor of Venezuela.He ows the TV channel called Venevision and when the students are been attacked, hitted, fired , arrested by the police , Venevision does not inform that. For Venevision only exists the government point of view.This guy has sold his soul to chavez."
4,Good history lesson,This film is first of all a good movie with fine acting. I also use it in the classroom to show 8th graders what was the situation in the South at the time of the famous Montgomery bus strike for African Americans. In addition I use the film to reflect what was the role of white women during that era. It shows the rise of both groups of women to be powerful forces.
3,The Long Walk Home,"The Long Walk Home was an excellent movie for all generations. It was very informative as well as touching. The movie was about the time of racial segregation and how families were affected by this era they were living in. The movie shows not only how African American families were affected but how the differences of opinions in white families were affected also. Even husbands and wives did not always agree on what was going on. This film is one to be remembered because it showed the truth, and even though the truth is not what many wish to see, it is the facts. Odessa showed courage, love, and most of all faith. Odessa was a great role model through the movie to Mary-Catherine. It was obvious in the movie that Mary-Catherine looked up to her. I would recommend this movie to many people of all ages and especially high scholars because it taught me a lot about how we got here today. The most important it showed me that it is ok to stand up for what you believe in."
2,Montgomery bus boycott told,"A young girl narrates the story of her maid walking home after workduring the bus strike in Montgomery, Alabama in the mid '50's.This boycott was the start of the civil rights movementthat came to a head in the 60's with the murder of Martin Luther King.The white middle class family could afford a maid in those times,but they lived in the colored neighborhoods far from the suburbs.most blacks on those wages even with two jobs in the family couldn't afforda car, so the bus was their way to get to and from work.When Rosa Parks was put in jail for not sitting in the back of the bus,the African Americans were solidly behind the boycott.These events happened nearly 100 years after the Civil warand became a second civil war in the deep south.The effort to shut down the car pool, that was set up totransport the servants to their work,with the mother and her little girl there is the big climatic scenein this movie and is well acted."
3,A heartfelt film w/Whoopi,"This was a great film showing the true struggles of the common man during the Civil Rights movement. On one end it showed that people can be really ignorant but on the other end it demonstrated that people CAN change for the better and not all hope is lost. This film should also serve as a reminder to students like myself that we are very fortunate for the amount of tolerance we have today. Not only did famous protesters like Rosa Parks make a difference, but the ""little"" voices of everyday people like Odessa Cotter was vital to the movement. This movie was on to remember and im glad my teacher selected such a good film. Whoopi Goldberg is also my favorite actress in the whole wide world."
2,Worst DVD copy ever!,"Really, Do not bother! A great film reproduced by a flim-flam DVD company. I was going to show this to my college students this evening. I don't even know if they could endure it. I certainly can't. Search for a used VHS copy. This hack job is terrible!"
3,Adequate,"These are plenty big enough, and thick enough for my use... I got them to protect the inside of my car when hauling things. They can be doubled over to provide extra padding. They did have a petroleum-like smell when they arrived, but it washed out.The package label says: ""WARNING: Always wear ANSI approved safety goggles when using this product. Before using this product, the user should read the operating instructions to understand everything about this product. Always wear the appropriate clothing and safety equipment when operating this product. Wash hand [sic] thoroughly after the use and handling of this product.."""
1,Moving Blankets,These blankets are crap! I thought they were the nice ones I see in moving vans.. Thick cotton etc.. They are anything but that! Polyester.. I hate that! BIG though.. If you want a huge huge one.. But not very padded as it states. Maybe I didnt read the fine print..
1,"While the price might be right, this is a very low quality product. You certainly get what you pay for.","While the price might be right, this is a very low quality product. You certainly get what you pay for. Chinese made and not a patch on USA quality."
2,Stinky,This thing does the job its ment to but has a terrible smell. It came with a note that said it may smell at first but it will go away. I have had it for months now and I am throwing it away because the smell is so strong in takes over whatever space I store it in.
3,Not as good as the last book in the series,"This was ok. I was hoping with the second book that this series was heating up a little bit. But I think this one slowed down a little bit and was not as exciting as the last. There was still plenty going on, and I did like the book, but I was really hoping for more. I'll probably keep reading this series, but I hope the next book improves on this one."
5,Bunch is Best,I loved the Sten books written with Alan Cole and I love this series as well. This third book is the best of the three. It made me long for the next book in the series. Chris if you ever read these - write more stories in this series!!!
3,Pierce-Arrow,The article on Pierce-Arrow has numerous errors of fact. More time spent on research into the subject would have produced a much better product.
2,Ivory Tower Polemics,"This book is a great example of the problem with the contemporary left: a paralysis by analysis by academics too comfortable in their lofty ivory tower to actually take any political action. There was a time when left intellectuals were more concerned class struggle than making tenure or getting published in the most trendy post-modern theory journal. Try to imagine the look on the face of any working class Joe sipping beer at a sports bar when confronted with the language this book is couched in. Ivory tower Marxist serve as an ""outlet"" for revolutionary energy in a capitalist society. The ivory tower radicalism espoused by this book is nothing but another system of control."
2,Not great,"The base is different than the one pictured, it says that the height can be adjusted from 50 to 35 when the height adjustment is just removing one section of pipe, so it should be 50 -OR- 35 in height - not great."
2,adorable but painful,"I purchased these boots since most of the reviews were good. However, the boots, as cute and sexy as they may be, are painful after a few minutes! I even purchased inserts as an attempt to get my money's worth.I still wear them, but not very often and certainly not anywhere I have to walk."
5,Nine West boot review,These boots are great. I got them on clearance for $39.99 and couldn't be happier. They're comfortable and stylish and look great with jeans. Nice quality!
2,Why not include the entire concert?,"I went to the tribute concert in 2001. It was a tremendous experience and probably the most satisfying event I have ever been to. The concert was almost four hours due to the recording situation. The best part of the show was the Pet Sounds segment which the makers of this DVD have failed on. Pet Sounds was played in its entirety, between each song a different singer would come out. The idea that you knew what song was coming next but didn't know who would be singing it was totally unique. The most entertaining performances of that night are not on this DVD and were not on TV when this originally aired. That is unfortunate to all who were unable to be at the event. Perhaps as with most Beach Boy product, they will rerelease it over and over and keep adding material. I was so disappointed at the lack of respect for the Pet Sounds section that I didn't even buy the DVD yet. I'll wait for the eventual rerelease."
4,An all Star Tribute to Brian Wilson,"Great DVD..will play over and over, the talent on this DVD is on its own."
5,Wonderful Experience,"Brian Wilson has shaped and changed the way music is heard and understood. This tribute DVD is one of the most amazing concerts I've ever seen. Vince Gil does Warmth Of The Sun as well as it can be done, and the rendition of Good Vibrations by the Wilson Sisters and the Beach Boy's Band with the Harlem Boy's Choir is simply the finest piece of music you can imagine: the beautiful voices, the flawless rendition of this difficult work and the full benefit of the choir is not something to be missed.This is an hour and a half of pure enjoyment and completes with a wonderful performance by Brian himself. Any Beach Boy's Fan will appreciate this Video sojourn into the works of one of the Masters of Pop Music.If there is any downside...it's that this album is not available on CD audio...or I'd be giving it to all my friends for Christmas."
3,Beautiful picture + Good Sound Quality + Some goods songs = Worth buying,"My favorite song on this DVD is ""Love and Mercy"". The lyrics are sentimental. The music is soothing. I bought the DVD because of this songThe other good thing about this DVD is you can turn the lyrics on. This helps me sing along the song mentioned above. I wish all the music DVD's have this feature."
5,Fabulous!,"Awesome concert! I bought it specifically for Vince Gill's performances but there are several other wonderful performances worth watching. ""Surfs Up"" with Vince and Crosby is beautiful and almost heartbreaking."
4,An amazing gathering of musical talent,"When I first saw the special on TNT, I couldn't beleive what I had heard. I sought out mp3's of the music as soon as I could since I didn't have access to a vcr at the time. I would constantly tell other musicians that I was working with about how amazing this special was. Finding the DVD some time later was a special treat. This disc is worth buying just for the songs that Vince Gill sings on. I get chills every time I hear his vocals on ""Surf's Up."" Granted there are some real clunkers on this (Ricky Martin, Go-Go's, Heart come to mind) but all you gotta do is hit the old skip button to get past them. My only wish is that (although the song is a bit of a downer) they would have done ""'Til I Die."" A wonderful collection of music that got me interested again in an extremely talented, if not troubled, musical group."
3,"DVD specs misleading, is *not* anamorphic widescreen!","Just a word of caution, I bought this DVD as it was advertised to be in 16:9 widescreen format, and I recently bought a widescreen HDTV set.Only when I got home and played it I discovered that it's in a 'fixed' widescreen format (i.e. black bars are encoded into the fullscreen picture) as opposed to the more commonly anamorphic widescreen format.So what I eventually got was a widescreen version surrounded by four black bars! I guess TNT hasn't produced too many DVD's yet for the marketplace, but they better check their video production values the next time, this one sucks!"
3,"A good, fun, British film","Overall, this is an enjoyable if (mostly) predictable, understated British comedy. Edward (Nick Moran) and his ""lonely hearts"" bride Samantha (Keeley Hawes) are a newlywed couple unwittingly staying at a hotel with an undertakers' convention. It's a setup to a comedy punchline, but there are some fun surprises as, to be expected, the wedded couple has not been entirely forthcoming with one another. The plot is pretty simple, with one one surprise at a time, but the acting is good and it's a funny movie most of the time."
3,Dull video,"This National Geographic Special is quite dull. The footage is OK, but there is no music track and the film is put together in such a way as to be dull."
2,Act of War: High Treason,I love the timely shipping and ease of the website. The product however did not come with a CD Key to activate the game. luckily I have still had the CD Key from my old game which has been lost. Also there was no booklet for the game in the package. No big deal though. Just would have liked the original CD Key that came with that game. Over all I'm happy with it.
2,Atari needs to make a patch...,...in order for the game to run properly. My original AOW works fine but this new game needs a patch. I had trouble installing it. In single player mode you CANNOT use the NAVAL UNITS. If it were not for the need of a patch I would like to play the game. I recieved the package fine just as advertised. Thanks you did a great job in getting me my game. It's up to Atarti to fix this game now!
4,Instructive and well done,"If you're looking for sizzling sex, this is NOT the DVD for you. But, if you're interested in watching committed couples experimenting with various sexual positions then this is a good tutorial. No flashy models, just average looking people laying it out there for you to see. The facilitator is effective and creates a friendly environment for the couples to share their experiences, likes and preferences. My wife and I enjoyed the DVD very much, so much so, that we ordered other DVD's in the same series."
5,Red Planet book review,"Red Planet is a very good book. I really enjoyed reading it. It was very complicated and exciting. Half of the plot is kept from you untill the last 4th of the book. That's when it gets really exciting! You discover that many secrets have been kept from you, and you meet many new characters. All in all this book is one of the very best books I have ever read, and I suggest it to everyone in the world!"
4,Fun,"My first introduction to Heinlein was ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" in junior high. I was hooked. I thought I read most of his early works, but a co-worker mentioned ""Red Planet"" and I didn't remember reading it. I downloaded it on my kindle and took off. The book was even more adolescent than I remember of other Heinlein earlier works. However, Heinlein was always fun and the plot was exciting. Heinlein had a knack of taking a boyhood escapade and turning it into inter-planetary incident. The scenery of the colony buildings, the canals, and the martian structures were vivid. His description of Mars at night was really beautiful. The images of the two boys speed skating on the canals to reach shelter before night falls and escaping from authorities were memorable and exciting.In summary, the book was a lot of fun. It was not the best book that Heinlein ever wrote, but some of the images and landscapes rival his best books."
4,Neat !,The book is the original text as it was written before it was edited (censored) for a 1950s audience. It was interesting to see the exapmle of the edit at the end of the book. It was an easy read and I enjoyed the story.
4,Red Planet,My 10 year old selected this book for a book report. We are reading it together. We are enjoying the adventure Jim and Frank (main characters) are on as they try to cross Mars. It's fun to imagine how the fantastic creatures look. Great juvenile novel.
5,"For one day, I was a child again...","After reading _ RED PLANET_ (in one day), I was almost tempted to go outside and play act the story...as I would do during my childhood years. I had to remind myself that I was twenty years old now:) and couldn't playact anymore. This is *the* book that I would recommend for any parent searching for suitable science fiction novels for his/her child(ren). _RED PLANET_ has enough action to keep a young reader entertained, while managing not to insult said young reader's intelligence."
4,Classic,A classic work by one of the old masters of science fiction even if a bit dated. May all Be presented.
5,I first read this 32 years ago and it remains a favorite!,"The first time I read this I was in fourth grade. It was a warm summer day and the library smelled odd. The book had a red hardcover with a gold outline of a boy in a spacesuit. It was dirty, probably dropped by the last kid who took it out. But it was about living on Mars, and we had not even landed on the Moon yet, so this was a true fantasy. I took it home and read it in one sitting, then I read it again. My son looks forward to reading this soon, too! A classic!"
3,"Excellent story, but kindle edition only has generic cover art!","The story is well written. I read this when I was in 8th grade many years ago. I just bought it for my 12 year old son, and he is enjoying it. He already read ""Have Space Suite, Will Travel"" and loved that.We were disappointed that the kindle edition only had generic cover art. I'll update my review from 3 to 5 stars when my kindle edition gets updated with real cover art.From now on, when considering kindle editions, I'm going try the sample first to verify that the cover art is included!"
2,Too bad the audio sucks,"Do not buy this DVD. The audio quality is horrible. It is not surround sound nor even what I would consider stereo of this classic concert of the idol at the height of his vocal powers. The video quality is only slightly better than the pirate DVD's of his older concerts that Wal Mart sells in the discount bin. But, at least they were only 3.99 a piece. Want a VF DVD with great audio and HD video ? Buy ""Primera Fila""."
3,Nice show but not very exciting...,"I have to give this only 3 stars. The audio and video are quite good. Of course Vicente's voice is spot on as usual. But this could have been much more entertaining & exciting vs. siesta time. Quite frankly, it gets a bit boring, dull and repetitive after awhile... At the start, it's a very impressive arena full of cheering fans, but all Vicente ends up doing is slowly walking around on the ""stage"" - just him, nobody else and that's what this entire DVD is. His great stature obviously commands respect, I just feel it gets old on this one...This is what you call a solo-act...I almost wish he'd fire off a few rounds from his pistolero(and wake me up)! That and a few ""moments of truth"" wouldn't hurt either...My advice, skip this one and buy a different Vicente Fernandez DVD. I have the Blue-Ray version of Primera Fila. It's a bit more lively..."
5,AWESOME,"What a way to kick off a career! With this classic album, the BLACK CROWES showed everyone they were a band to be watched. This album just is full of great music that is full of energy, great guitars, awesome vocals and complete with attitude. I have two copies of this album the original, and the remastered that I bought for the bonus tracks. I highly recommend that you give this album a real good listen. The CROWES have a perfect blend of all their musical influences on this album. You can sense the classic rock of the STONES, FACES and LED ZEPPELIN here along with the R&B and Blues music they also grew up listening to. This has to be one of the essential recordings ever released and should be part of every serious music fans collection. Listen to TWICE AS HARD, JEALOUS AGAIN, SHE TALKS TO ANGELS, HARD TO HANDLE, SEEING THINGS and all of the other songs on this disc. Every one is a great one"
4,Only the beginning,"This album is well worth having for the high energy funky southern rock (you'll remember any number of the radio hits), but please don't neglect Armorica or Three Snakes and a Charm, which had less stomping uptempo rock but some truly great harmonies, melodies and soul, and really creative songs. I think the Black Crowes have given in a bit on more recent albums to the pressure to reach too hard for this album's uptempo rock and have not made the most of what would otherwise have been some great but radio unfriendly songs."
5,great,"great great great album. most albums i listen to this much, i get tired of, but this album doesnt get old. crowes best!!!"
5,My favorite CD,"Great driving or studying music. Also great backgroud music for when hanging out. My all-around, all-time favorite!"
4,"Not Perfect, but perhaps the Best of the Crowes.","Somewhat lyrically challenged, repetative, swaggering, and not without a bad song (Struttin' Blues). However, these points don't even describe half of Shake Your Money Maker. It's got the great ""Sister Luck"", ""Hard to Handle"" by Otis Redding, and the marvelous ""She Talks to Angels"". The Crowes have never been a perfect band, but they're great performers, and this is a marvelous introduction to their music.Overall, I'd give it a 90."
5,Great album,"This is a rare time that I've heard a complete album since the days of the early Van Halen albums. Every track on here is GOOD.What makes The Black Crowes so great to me is that they combine my three favorite genres of rock, soul, and some blues and they do it well...You got southern rock songs like Twice As Hard, Sister Luck, Thick n Thin... You got a great balld in She Talks to Angels... Hard rockers in Stare It Cold and Jealous Again... And you got possibly the most catchy song the 90's and that is the cover of Hard to Handle.If you're a rock, soul and blues fan I suggest picking this album up... It might not be from a classic time period, but it sure is a classic album from start to finish.Best TracksTwice As HardHard to HandleSister LuckShe Talks to AngelsSeeing ThingsJealous Again."
3,Earnestly early effort,A noticeable if overrated debut did manage to somehow pull off making southern rock hip again and include a pinch of memorable songwriting amidst deep-fried limitations.
3,"Good debut, but it wore on me.","This was a good debut from a promising band, but to be honest after a few plays I felt like I heard all I needed to hear. Hearing ""Hard to Handle"" on the radio way before they got popular was a breath of fresh air, but after a while this record got old to me."
3,Not a Bad Hard Rock Record,"I think this album is pretty cool. It mainly hard-southern rock n roll. Quite a few of the songs on here are famous. Since this was 1991, and the horrible grunge era was beginning, it's pretty hard to believe that a Aerosmith-y kind of band like this waould have a #5 album on the Billboard chart. it was quite influential and we wouldn't have the wonderful band Jet today if it weren't for these guys. It's really more of a 3.5 album. I'd reccomend it to fans of Jet or UYI-era GNR."
5,Shake Your Money Maker,"I must say that this is the most influential albums of my adolescence. I can literally recite every lyric of this album twenty years later. Awesome all the way through unlike many albums these days. If you have not experienced it then expect a total engulfment of southern rock and literally a new outlook on music, period. I can listen to this another thousand times and not get tired of it. Owe part of my life to it!"
4,i still like it,This was popular when I was growing up and I like it more now that I respect The Black Crowes more as a band. They didn't really become a hugely popular group and only a couple of their songs are still played on regular rock radio stations. Their latest releases have revealed them to be an excellent band that has stood the test of time.
3,Exploration on human sexual relationships,"An interesting exploration on human sexual relationship. Without minimizing Bunuel's importance in world cinema, this movie is still stuck in its own time and place. It would be difficult for younger generations to relate to the exploration of the older man's obsession for the young woman and their kinky, if twisted, relationship presented in this film. It is interesting that director is using two very different acresses for the role of the main female character, which is what makes this film truly unique. But, if you are to watch a presentation of the complexity of human (sexual and emotional) relationship, and you belong to a younger generation, your better choice would be to watch film ""Secretary"" with Maggie Guyenhall."
5,A Mediterannean Woman,A magnificient sample of Med woman. Reminds of my ex-girl friend. A must see film who are interested in art in film.
2,Disgusting and pointless.,"""Listen, Bunuel. What are we going to do? The witch has quit. Says: too much nudity. Who does she think she is - Mother Theresa?""""I am a little busy, JP (Quiet, babe! I am talking to my producer here!). Just get another broad for the role: anybody, only with a good front.""""But, Maestro! We'd have to re-shoot half of the movie. Fernando's already talking of another engagement. In any event, with his rate if we use him again, it will be twenty years before we see any money from this flick. We might as well scrap the whole thing.""""Don't worry, JP. We'll keep shooting as if nothing happened. That's what being Great Director all about. They are morons, or why would anybody pay cash to see such garbage? Most won't even notice that the face is different, and those who do, will find a good explanation for it. Subliminal, surreal, existential, women are alike - all that nonsense, you know. Relax and have a drink."""
5,Try it you'll love it,"This is one of the finest books I have read in a very long time. Gary Lucas is a writer that keeps you interested until the very last page of his book. I could not put it down and when I did complete it, I wanted more. Hope he will continue writing and being published again and again. Move over Patterson and Grisham, you have some competition here."
3,"Useful content, not well organized","This book has interesting and useful information about the subject, but the organization and flow are not good. It needs a good editor. It seems hurriedly put together from notes. The story could be a lot more interesting if well told."
5,You can never get enough Bernstein!,These pieces are comforting as you go about your daily tasks...I really appreciate this album. It makes a wondrous addition to my favorite pieces.
3,"Useful, but limited","Good information about such things as hygiene and manners, which according to women I've dated are far from uniformly decent among men. Good points about women having fantasies and wanting men, truths which some men's experience may cause them to forget. Magnificent sex techniques. An admirably upbeat ""you-can-do-it"" tone throughout.Given that, it has problems. A former consort to Henry Miller is not a representative woman. If more of her peers were as horny and adventuresome as her, the dating game would be vastly easier for those of us who are simply wonderful people, not movie directors, professional baseball players, or fantastically confident and frustration-tolerant men in their twenties. I would like to give two dozen similarly dazzling women with more mainstream attitutes some truth serum and ask them where they ACTUALLY met their boyfriends and what characteristics they ACTUALLY had that they loved. Now THAT would make a good book on seduction!"
4,A primer for the socially challenged,"If you are not very adept at meeting and attracting women, this is a bible for grooming and conduct. Some of the tips have limited applicability (unless you also run in the author's monied circles), but I cannot say that she is wrong in anything she suggests. From specific hygiene suggestions to dining how-to's, this book covers a lot of ground. My single complaint is the ""I am speaking for all women"" tone, and the overuse of exclamation marks. This my just be my pet peeve..."
4,"Tremendous, tremendous!","Before reading this book I was hopeless with the ladies. But after learning the secrets of putting on deoderant and shampooing my hair, I am quite the Reverend Dinshaw. I have managed to seduce someone with who is very hot indeed! Not the ""Ideal Ida"" which Ms Venus describes. But no two women are alike, and I can't hope for such perfection as Ida, but I found someone close. However! I am absconding with her to my mountainous New Mexican retreat, where we will no doubt enjoy romantic rose-petal strewn evenings. And I will not just pull down my pants and show my tool in public, or at least not until the second date. Ha ha. So, in summery, I have to hand it to Brenda Venus for teaching me the ins and outs of having a way with the ladies -- and by the way, I have had many outs before!"
5,Pleasant surprise,If you don't know Haydn's piano sonatas but enjoy Mozart's and Beethoven's this disc will be a pleasant surprise. Much more of Haydn's music is recorded now including the operas which I don't know yet. A bad day for Haydn would be when he was merely excellent. Try his string quartets too if you don't know them but if you like string quartets you probably do. Pogorelich is always superb.
3,A very nice wrap up.,"Frieza has now lost it and flashbacks are shown of the fight between Goku and Frieza up until where they are now. After Goku defeats Frieza, he desperately tries to find a way off Namek but can't and it appears that he blew up with the planet, but when he is wished back, the Dragon says he's still alive! Yamcha, Tien, Chao-Tsu, and Krillin are wished back and everything wraps up nicely. The reason I gave this DVD 3 stars is because for some reason the sound quality was really bad. It might just be THIS particular DVD, but I'm not sure."
1,Arrived quickly- just not what I thought it was going to be.,It looks very cheap when put on your car. I dont feel like I was cheated at all I am just not happy with the quality of the product.
3,BEWARE!!!,"Joseph Smith was a fraud. The whole Mormon religion is based on lies, false information, deception, half-truths etc. It's racist too. The Book of Mormon reads more like a fairy tale than anything else. The sad thing is that I believe many of its adherents are well-meaning, but misguided. How can so many people be deluded? I pray that they will seek Jesus before it's too late."
2,Ummm... Right....,"I personally am tired of outsiders creating screwed up fantasized realities about the LDS church. If you want to read something about a church then read something close to objective. This book does not accomplish that. It is right away assumed that the Book of Mormon is simply Joseph Smith's great work of fiction that he incorporates himself into. As if the life stories of oh, 20 people or more would not otherwise resemble Joseph Smith's life. And to sit and treat a prophet of God as a mentally ill or just psychiatric patient that needs psychoanalyzing is simply absurd. Most would agree it sacreligious to do so to Christ or Muhammad. The same is applicable to Joseph Smith. There's a certain amount of respect that the dead have earned. Award it to them. But of course, I'm just a teen ager, so what do I know, right?"
1,Why,"Imagine that your satan himself... now if there was one church that was truly God's own church, would you or would you not do what you could to place hatred in the hearts of any man you could so that they woulld try to discreadit it? Would'nt you want to do what you could to keep as many as possable away from it? And how would you go about doing that? Would you try literture and media? Just a few questions to ponder."
2,Humbug in search of humbug,"Garbage in, garbage out. I consider psychoanalysis to be a set of ridiculous and false doctrines invented by a hoaxer and charlatan named Sigmund Freud. Thus, to attempt at the distance of 200 years to read the mind of the Sphinx of Nauvoo, and to attempt this reading within the context of Freudian humbuggery, is to turn truth on its head. The question is, how does a fraudulent system serve as a context for proving that another system is fraudulent? People in glass houses throwing rocks!"
2,Harley Davidson Chrome plated emblem truck accessory,For the price I paid I would have thought it to be a chrome plated METAL emblem and not a chrome plated PLASTIC emblem in which it is. So for future buyers you can go to your local HD dealer and ask to look at HD Medalions.
1,It's not chrome!,"I bought this item as a test sample of chrome plate over plastic. Our lab tested it with X-ray fluorescence. There is not a speck of chrome on it. THe silvery coating contains zinc and titamium, probably in a lacquer medium. There is a surprising amount of bromine present. Disappointing."
3,"I just didn't ""get"" his style of writing","There's really not alot for me to say here, except that clearly some people relate differently to different styles of writing. I didn't like this book at all. It didn't make me ""feel"" anything as I read the stories. Most often, I was like ""huh""? Please know that I am not one who needs a ""point"" to a story in order to appreciate it. I can find alot of pleasure in one or two sentences, depending on how they are written. I very much prefer the styles of writing found in ""Flash Fiction: 72 Very Short Stories"" and ""In Short: A Collection of Brief Creative Nonfiction""."
3,An interesting failure,"I suspect the only audience for ""Stories in the Worst Way"" will be other writers - no one else is likely to have heard of Lutz (or even Gordon Lish, for that matter) and his stories haven't and won't ever find an appreciative mainstream audience.Lutz's prose is really interesting, the way that he invents and re-invents words and constructs sentences in bizarre fragments. After reading ""Stories ..."" I was honestly inspired to start playing with language and taking risks with my own writing. Unfortunately, Lutz's characters and stories are poorly developed and dreadfully boring. Every narrator is a repellant, self-loathing neurotic. Every story just sort of starts, meanders around for awhile and then ends. Nothing happens. The man can really write prose but his stories frankly suck.I'm giving this three stars only because Lutz approach to language is so different and fresh, but that is the only reason to read ""Stories in the Worst Way."""
5,All Hail Gary Lutz!,"Gary Lutz is to postmodernism what Henry Miller was to modernism, it's as simple as that. Here we have a writer who deserves to be cannonized, by his unique aplomb, cutting-edge wit, incomparable story-craft, and sensitivity to social issues pervading our culture of commodity and appearances...and yet he's outright ignored by the ""Establishment."" There is no hope for those glib, irony-insensitive, self-righteous critics who think of his work as overbaked and pretentious...he's obviously trying to use his style to make a valid point or two. Go back to the classroom and stop trying to impress us all with your fashionably hateful and derived commentary."
5,K. Battle is amazing.,Simply incredible... one of the greatest sopranos (at her best) in Carnegie Hall! A dream come true and an experience that is not worth missing!
3,"A charming, lightweight song recital","This recital is a pale shadow of the great one Battle gave with Levine from Salzburg, so I wasn't satisfied with one track after another of pretty, charming singing without deep musicality or committment. battle is capable of much beter. Her fans will be pleased, and that's about all."
2,This voice has got to be one of the best ever...............,"Before everyone tar and feathers me and runs me out of town on a rail, please let me explain about my review. Kathleen has one of the true great voices. I would put her among the top five sopranos in the world. She is ever bit as good as Jessye Norman, Barbara Hendricks, Kiri Te Kanawa, Lesley Garrett at el.Geting back to my review, well her voice was definetly a ten. The only reason that I rated this cd a two was because most of the songs were from the classical venue. Don't get me wrong, I really like classical music, but my preference is classical music that is performed instrumentaly not vocally.I didn't think it helped that this cd was recorded live. I had much rather hear a studio project.Recommendation: I think Kathleens' fans should buy this cd."
4,Lovely,"Kathleen has a beautiful voice, and it's wonderful to have a CD that includes both traditional opera pieces as well as fun gospel songs. I recommend this!"
4,Seem to be working,"This product seems to be doing what I expected. I began using these glasses about a week after I got them. I noticed a slight shift in my eyesight in about a week. I've had them about a month now and have been using them about 15-30 minutes each night. I was wearing reading glasses at 1.25 before I started using the pinholes, and thinking I needed to increase the strength to 1.50. Now I am wearing 1.00 reading glasses and feel like the pinholes are responsible for that shift. I can't compare this particular brand of pinholes to other brandss, though, because these are the first I've ever had. At times the black partitions do seem to get in the way of reading and I have to put my mind on the reading and off the glasses."
2,very poor,"I could not see through them because of the number of holes - or something!!!?I had a pair a few years ago, and they were perfect!!!I can cup my hand around and see better than I can see through these glasses.They look similar to the other ones, but something must be different, that I can't identify.If I couldn't see through a cupped hand, I would say it is my eyes, but that is not the case.I would love to return them, but it was too complicated a process, so I just chalked it up to a bad decision."
3,Pin Hole Glasses,"Yes I purchases the Pin Hole Glasses. But I have not been using them enough. I should be more serious about this but with the holidays I was kind of busy. I do beleive these glasses would work if given a chance.Sincerely,HKPin Hole Glasses Black Full Frame Kit"
1,Don't waste your money.,"These are incredibly cheap and flimsy! I knew someone who bought a pair elsewhere for $3, and they were much better quality. Also, the holes in the glasses are entirely too small! I am VERY unsatisfied with this particular product, and will never recommend to anyone. I wish that I hadn't even wasted the money. :(EDIT: My main complain is the quality of the glasses. I have to hold them to my face even after following the directions for warping them to fit your face. They're also uneven, lopsided on my face, and were that way initial to the adjustment. It is extremely hard to even see through the glasses this way, and defeats the whole purpose if none of the pinholes actually line up with both of my pupils. The booklet that came with the glasses is a good booklet, BUT the main reason I purchased the kit if for THE GLASSES. So, basically, I spent $20 for a 12-page booklet. Swindled, indeed."
4,Good lighting required...,These surprised us. It's amazing how using them allows me to read up close and small text. Cheaper ones are available but I'm not sure they are as large as these.
5,Can't believe I see the numbers on te clock,"I bought these for my son, who wears glasses with numbers off the chart. When I heard about these glasses I spoke to him about buying them for his and he said his father in law used them and yes I could buy them for him. The first time he used them he said he could not believe he could read the wall clock which usually was just a blob on the wall without glasses. He has been using them a few minutes a dayand seems to be seeing better. He is happy and so am I, with time I hope that his vision will keep on improving."
1,WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT...,"I'm still trying to understand and respect other people opinions but in this case I can't,period.Whoever is reading this review please understand that I love horror movies and I consider ""The Item"" the worst horror movie ever if it can be considered as a horror movie.Those who rate this movie with 5 stars and I'd read their reviews,they were trying to post a joke or make fool of the rest who believe their comments about this movie,so please have some dignity and never,please never dare to rent or worse buy this movie.P.D. ...but wait maybe if a junkie(of course clean) watch this movie can rehabilitate or under theinfluence could die shockingly."
1,One of the sickest films ever!!!!,"Warning for all horror movie fans,this isn`t what your looking for:(I shouldnt have I rented the Item.This movie is so sick with a million cursewords and gay people and beyond gallons of blood and how about the gal having a good time the fake puppet? That scene was so low i [was sick] all night from just thinking of it! STAY AWAY FROM THIS ...!!!!"
1,Very misleading!,"I saw this movie based on the cover and thought it might be a low budget gem like the recently released Tremors 3. The box promises a myserious creature on the cover, a very menacing eye at the very least, but fails to deliver. The monster is very poorly done and is very unthreatening. The film is also apparently shot on videotape. It has a kind of cheap mid-seventies charm in its filmography but is neither involving or interesting. Stay away! Stay FAR away!!!"
1,"THIS MOVIE IS SO BAD YOU HAVE TO BUY IT, SERIOUSLY.","I SWEAR, THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE. I BOUGHT IT JUST SO I COULD MAKE OTHER ENDURE THE WRATH OF THIS MOVIE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IMMEDIATLEY AFTER WATCHING THIS (PROVIDED THAT YOU DO NOT COMMIT SUICIDE), YOU STANDARS FOR MOVIES DROPS DRAMATICALLY. EVERYTIME YOU HEAR A FRIEND OR LOVED ONE SAY DURING A MOVIE, ""THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE EVERMADE"". YOU WILL REPLY, ""NOT AT ALL MY UNENLIGHTEND FRIEND, I OWN THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE"" SO THAT IS WHY YOU MUST BUY IT."
1,absolutely the worst!,"I was shocked at how terrible this video was. I watched it once and that was certainly enough. I am a fan of horror movies and I thought that the box looked ok for a low-budget movie. I purchased it and,when I made it through(barely!),I could not believe it! It was so stupid, to me. I tried to get a refund or exchange at the video store, but was not able to. I threw the movie in the trash can!The worst parts were the needless and stupid bloodshed and the ending of the movie. The ""item"" was a silly looking thing too!Please make sure you rent this movie before purchasing it. Don't make the same mistake I did.This is my own personal opinion. Be your own judge!"
1,May god have mercy on your soul,This is the most god aweful movie ever. I wanted to kill myself during the movie to end my suffering. I wasted two hours of my life that I will never get back. You would have to pay me to watch this movie again. Watching paint dry would have been more entertaining.
1,wow this movie really sucks..,"The Item is one of the worst movies ever made next to Carnosaur(now that movie was a joke). As said before from previous reviewers the cover is misleading. THE CREATURE DOESNT EVEN LOOK GREAT NOR HAVE EYES LOOKING LIKE THE WAY IT DID ON THE COVER! Stupid plot, Criminal watching after a box with a deadly creature and try win a million bucka-rews.The movie is Pure crap and I'm not even gonna go into the whole bizarre plot but I will say this movie involves Tranvestites, killings, guns, and lots of bad acting. If anyone whoe looked at the back of the cover of this film(or monkey crap as what I called this film)they should have noticed something mentioning about Tarantino(I forgot what it was cause I saw this piece of doo doo a loooong time ago)and was the main reason I even saw this flick.What ever you do do not watch this film, it was one of the worst films ever even if it is a direct to video film....Trust me..1.0 out 5 starsLates"
1,Return this Item,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Looking forward to a fun, perhaps off-track horror flick, this one misses the mark by a mile. From the overly juicy sound effects to the buckets of gore, this is one ""Item"" I'd like to return!"
3,Its a good corny movie,"""The Item"" was pretty good for a hardcore independent movie. It had some really funny, original scenes. Its not going to win any awards, but it was fun to watch."
1,embarrassing,"This is the most annoying, stupid movie I have ever seen. I am a B-movie veteran who has watched aweful movies the likes of which commoners can never even fathom. Yet somehow this is probably my least favourite. It tries so hard to be cutting edge, innovative, and quirky. There's more transvestites and gratuitous gunplay than you could shake a stick at, I hate all the characters (and not in a good, Russ Tamblyn way), and it has the MOST IDIOTIC SCENE EVER!!!!!!!!!! Yes - dumber than the animal cracker scene in the 1998 Ben Affleck romp, ""Armageddon""(Here I am making fun of this movie, but I don't know how to spell 'Armageddon')! I won't try to explain it though, but it involves the ridiculous monster(The least threatening creature since ELMER, from'Brain Damage') and the main guy's girlfriend. Embarrassing.P.S. don't censor thisp.p.s. I'm not really 4. I'm 4 and a half!"
1,abysmal,"don't even think about purchasing one of the worst horror movies of all time,PLEASE save your money.The movie got 1 star from me cause it would not allow a lower rating."
1,....................................(Cricket noise).........,"The cover looks nothing like what the movie is all about. The monster isnt reptilian. It is a worm-like ... monster. It plays mind games instead of the violent portrayal that you would expect from a movie with this cover. I would rather have put my face in a blender than watch this atrocity. If you like soap operas crossed with naked muppets, please watch it."
1,Don't buy this movie!,"I watched this movie and could not believe I sat through the whole thing. The acting was bad from the absolute beginning and the quality of the film was that of a show shot on a cable access channel. The so called ""item"" was this horrible stage prop that looked like a worm with a big phallus as a tail. The end of the movie was horrible and left me feeling like ""what the hell!?"". It was sick and I will never trust the description of a movie again!"
1,...,... What a waste of film!!The movie is a 100% dissapointment. You would think the creature would look like something attached to the alien like eye in the cover?...wrong it looks like a stiched up plastic rag doll. this movie isnt even funny. ...please save your money.
1,The Stupidest Movie I have Ever Seen!,This movie is the stupidest movie I have ever seen -NOT even worth the 3.99 Rental - It deserves to be thrown in the garbage or for target practice ;)I will Stick with Dario Argento.
1,lol,"I've heard nothing but bad word of mouth on this film, and I havn't even seen it! lol. I just know that I'm going to have to rent it to see what all the talk is about! I look forward to the puppet sensual scene with the chick! lol"
4,you are a collective,"Great for artists; Guttari basically says art is an aesthetical production of new forms of subjectivity, and subjectivity is always pre-individual. the Subject is always a collective, an interesting thought. Although you feel dumped in that post structuralist wordclog world, a good book for current artists."
5,A timeless classic,"I first heard this album in 1979, & I was hooked for life. A master singer-songwriter, Janis Ian is a major talent. Where is she now? ""From Me To You', 'Between the Lines' and ""In the Winter' are unforgettable. Sad songs, beautiful songs, memorable songs. All the songs in the album are of a high quality. I have Janis Ian on CD now. Haven't heard anything after the 'Night Rains' album."
5,Good Memories,"I guess as many of you, I heard Janis Ian's ""between The Lines"" LP many many times during my teenage years. It was a joy being able to listen to it again, this time on a CD format. Good music, good lyrics. Overall, a very good collection of songs coming from the soul."
5,"What can I say, Iove Janis!","I would recommend this product to anyone who loves Janis! My husband bought this for me by mistake for christmas, I already had it, Well, I'll give it to my sister"
5,My favorite record of all-time,"This is one of the best written albums of all times. Janis's sweet voice of loss, rejection and love has stood the test of time. I've listened to it countless times over and over again over the last 25 or so years since it came out and it's still my most favorite album of all times.Check out here other stuff too. She still has a recording contract and is still making awesome albums."
5,Take me back to the old days and let me bring them here.,"I listen to these selections and suddenly no matter what's going on around me good or bad, I feel really content. This album demonstrates the talent that this artist was blessed with. I am an old nostalgic anyway and this music just opened up all the great memories of that time for me. It just doesn't get any better than this. Totally awesome!!"
5,Just Beautiful,This was a seminal LP of the mid 70's. When it was released I was going through a painful broken engagement and this record seemed to capture the emotions I was going through. The musical inspiration never flags and Janis's voice captures the mood of each song. I saw Janis many times in concert here in Australia and she was always wonderful (and a superb musician). I had the privilege of meeting her at a concert and CD signing - what a lovely woman.
5,years come back,"i lost all my music in a fire, 8 tracks cassettes thought i would never find a lot of my favorites again. i live on amazon and quit smoking to get the greats like Janis Ian Thanks amazon"
5,Always Captivating,Water Colors reveals the complexity and emotions between men and women as only Janis Ian is able to expose it. Janis helps us put thoughts to what we feel.
1,Pretty God-Awful!!!!,"This CD is really tiresome and has to be one of the most self-indulgent ever produced, especially the cut ""At Seventeen."" Hearing it all was excruciating. Get a Britney Spears or Jennifer Lopez CD instead."
4,JANIS IAN - GREAT OLD ALBUM. hOPE SHE DOES A NEW ONE.,"pRODUCT WAS RECEIVED VERY TIMELY AND IN GREAT SHAPE. wOULD DEFINITELY BUY FROM THIS PERSON AGAIN. nAME OF ALBUM IS ""BETWEEN THE LINES."""
2,BLANKET,"I AM SENDING THIS BACK.. I HAD IT IN MY TRUCK AND ONLY AFTER 15 MIN THE PART YOU PUT INTO THE CIGARETTE OUTLET OR ACCESSORY OUTLET THAT PART GETS SO HOT THAT IT BURNS YOU. I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO DO THAT, AND I REALIZE IT CAN START ON FIRE."
1,still not received,I haven't received this item. very poor customer service. vendor not receptive to queries regarding item.
3,Not for kids,Its a model of an anime with that said not recommended for kids. If your kid gets one his has issues take him to a Doctor before he develops chronic issues lol.
3,"Good fan, but arrived in non-working condition","I got this fan based on the good reviews here on Amazon. The fan itself turned out to be good once I got it working. I'm not sure how this happened, but when I took the fan out of the box the fan blade wasn't attached to the motor. I had to unscrew the case, attach the blade, and reassemble it (ironically it says ""do not disassemble fan"" in the instructions). Once that was done the fan has worked perfectly. Still, due to this major inconvenience I can't give the product a high rating. I'm sure this is a rare case, so take my experience with a grain of salt. It's possible the blade detached during shipping."
5,light and very portable,We use this fan everyday along with the air conditioner. Its portable enough for anyone to move around and is a big relief in the kitchen when things heat up.
3,Good But Falsely Advertised,"This fan works well and is assembled out of the box, however, it is advertised as a wall mount fan when it is NOT. It sits on the floor and tilts up and down. Don't be deceived by this!!"
3,Lasko 3300 wall mount fan,"After visiting someone who had this fan operating at the bottom of their stairs,and blowing up to the 2nd floor of their house.I was very impressed.I tried to find this fan locally.No luck ,so I ordered it thru Amazon.The fan is pretty quite for the amount of air it moves.And over all ,I am pleased.The fan I received wasn't packed with anything to protect it other that the box the manufacturer put it in.And it's blades wobble pretty good when its running.I think this is going to shorten the life of the fan.Had I bought it locally, I would have returned it for one that had a fan blade that was balanced.And I would have given it five stars."
1,I don't know how this fan gets such rave reviews.,"Living in the desert, one can not live merely by AC alone [unless you are incredibly wealthy and can afford NV Energy rates]. So using a fan in every room helps immensely! We purchased three of these fans a year ago, and they do run 24/7. After about three months, the motor seems to wear and the RPMs are not as fast as originally when new. The highest speed ends up after time, being what would be equal to the lowest speed when new.Then one day, after about six months, you will walk in a room and the fan has simply stopped running. We have replaced all three fans this year however, two already are starting to slow down and probably won't last the season.While these fans may be good for medium duration use [6-10 hours a day], they are not good for 24/7 use. And we have found this to be the same with the Lasko box fans.When these die in the next couple of months, we won't be replacing them with a Lasko."
5,Really nice.,"This fan really moves the air. To give you an idea how good this fan works, do you know those 20"" box fans they sell for 15 or 20 bucks, well this Lasko 3300 fan on low blows as hard as the 20"" box fan on high. No kidding. I think this is by far the best fan I've ever owned.Will post a couple pictures for you to get a better look at it. I would recommend this to anyone in need of a fan. Don't hesitate, buy it."
3,Don't recommend seller,"First of all I want to say the fan is fine. Its like a typical window fan I put my box fan and this one nearby.. almost the same. With that being said I would like to warn you all... do NOT buy from this seller. I ordered two fans, plugged them in immediately and one was broken.. they sent a new one and the new one is cracked! I took pictures but I am not sending it back, gas is NOT CHEAP and I'm not driving across town to return this.. again the fan isn't all that special and this seller is selling DAMAGED MERCHANDISE!!!"
5,"Favorite album, EVER","Disclaimer: I love most (if not all) Brazilian reggae but this album takes the prize for my reggae album EVER. Natiruts has such a smooth and soothing voice and the way the music is all put together, it's truly excellent. The best part about this album, as compared to other reggae albums, is that each song sounds different. Usually, I buy a reggae album, and while I enjoy all of it, I could put one song of repeat and think I was listening to the whole album -- not so with this one. Each song has its own distinct rhythm and feel."
3,Incorrect Picture Displayed,The picture displayed with the listing was exactly like the unit I purchased over 25 years ago and served me well. I purchased this new unit and it looks like the photo you are currently displaying.The pressure gauge repeatedly have getting up to pressure instead of wiggling as described in the manual( quite unnerving).
4,Good pressure cooker,"It does its job without troubles.It is good looking also and light (Aluminum).Yes, I will recommend to a friend."
1,Mirro 92160A 6 quart aluminum pressure cooker,I have a Mirro 40 yr old Pressure cooker that I love. The gasket is old and needed replacing so I tried to do that but the replacement is too thin to create the seal needed to build up the pressure so I ordered this cooker. The quality of this cooker is not as good as the one I have and I couldn't get the lid back on . It claims it is a 6 quart cooker but my original one is 6 quart and the new one is much smaller- I am so disappointed I cannot continue to use my original one. It has served me well for 40 years and the only problem with it is I need the proper width gasket and that does NOT seem to exist!!! In my opinion in this instance NEW is NOT better.
1,Shipped wrong product and wouldn't pay shipping to return it.,"Product they shipped was not the product they listed. Seller admitted the listing was wrong and allowed me to return it for a refund, but they would not pay for shipping back to them even though it was their error. They even tried twice to get me to keep the wrong product, once before they told me I could return it, and once after I had already sent it back."
1,"unable to get lid to seal, where do i return it to?","i am unable to get lid to seal, several members of family are unable to either, should i return it and if so where do i return it to?thank you"
2,Not Happy,"I have canned a lot with my mother as a girl. We used many different canning methods for different things, but never did we have such a pain as I did with this canner. I would recommend a canner with a gauge on it so that you can see what the pressure is while it is building in the canner. The wobbly top guage is for the ""birds""."
3,"Great size, poor instructions","I asked for this for Christmas because of the large width of the pan. One of my favorite things to pressure cook is lasagne and this holds a 9 inch dish. A standard cooker only holds a 7 inch dish. My husband and son make short work of a 7 inch lasagne.I wouldn't recommend this for someone who's never used a pressure cooker before. The instructions are very poorly written and it's impossible to reach customer service with a question. As of Christmas their website had no information on it other than a phone number which went to an over-filled voicemail box.This is one of three pressure cookers I own, so I eventually figured out how the pressure setting works, sort of.Overall I'd say the product is adequate but not great. It does what it's supposed to -- pressure cook. If I had to buy another PC, I'd look for a different brand with the same capacity and skip Mirro."
3,"Safe, but....","We have owned this pressure cooker for a few years. It has served us pretty well and has frustrated us plenty as well. The gaskets in these break down and release all of the pressure. You may end up playing the game of opening and closing the pan a few times to get it to pressurize. It is a good sized pan for doing a bag of beans, or a simple meat dish for less than 6 servings.If you have been afraid of the pressure cookers, don't be any longer. These gadgets are very safe and will turn you into a world class frugal gourmet. The safety features are so numerous and foolproof that they border on ridiculous. The old days of exploding pressure cookers is gone; unless you can find a way to bypass at least 6 safety mechinisms. Buy one, maybe not this one, and save on cheap meats and low priced beans and legumes. They cook up so tender and so flavorful and so fast that you will never want to live without one again."
4,Pressure Cooker user,This smaller cooker works fine for our empty-nest family. I would have rated it as 5-star if it had been furnished with a grid to prevent scorching. Otherwise it works as I expected it would.
1,Do not use this product with a Glass Top Stove,"I cannot blame Mirro, but Amazon did not have in their write up that Mirro says not to use this Pressure Cooker with a glass or ceramic stove top. This particular cooker has a concave bottom and is to be used with gas or an electric element type stove. It will not reach the right temperature on a glass or ceramic top stove."
2,cheap made,i returned it was not what i was looking for not thick enough for me i went back to my old one with a new sealno problems with the return and also fast shipping
4,Nice but missing an esential,"This is a really good pressure cooker. Did everything we wanted it to. BUT it didn't come with a canning rack. We bought this so we could pressure cook some jars, not for jelly, but none the less, we had to make a rack out of disposable pie tins."
3,Interesting,"Before I put a review on here about this back when I was in high school, saying that this was the real elvis. The problem was, I had no idea what I was talking about. I don't know if this man was a christian. From what I've heard it sounds like he was not, but rather he enjoyed gospel music. There are some exciting performances in this, as well as some neat stories. There did seem to be too much talking however."
3,"Good documentary, but to little live performances","I was really exited when I first discovered that there is a dvd available about Elvis's Gospel music. Although the 2-dvd set was a great documentary, I expected more... I wanted to see Elvis perform ""He Touched Me, Amazing Grace, Bosom of Abraham, I John"", etc. Maybe mosty of his gospel songs are only on cd... If there could be a dvd with scene selections covering Elvis's gospel music, I will be the first to buy because Elvis sings Gospel music wonderfully!"
1,not such a good buy,"Owned it about 1 year and made about 50-100 prints in that time. Then it stopped printing, saying cyan ink was out. Bought a new cartridge, same problem. Called tech support; that's where you repeat the online troubleshooting page you just finished doing, but in case you're really dumb, they read it to you.Bottom line, ""its a hardware problem"", so they give you the phone number to the closest repair facility...of course, they give the FAX number.Then they bring you to their ""loyalty"" page. 'Loyalty' is a TWO way affair...it requires Epson to make a good product so I'll buy another product.I'm sure I'll be lining up to make another Epson product purchase...NOT!"
3,"Great for Teens, not for Adult readers or die-hard fans","I aquired this book along with about 16 Isaac Asimov classics (Foundation series, Caves of Steel, etc). I plan on reading the Foundation/Robot series chronologically from the beginning. If you are a die-hard fan like me, you will find this book/series unbearable. The book is written for a young reader according to the author. This is seen through the repetition of every single 3 law conflict over and over throughout the novel. Every situation is explained in detail with reason why Robot X can or can't do because of Law X. For a new reader that isn't familiar with Asimov this book would probably be very informative. If you are interested in Time travel, buy The End of Eternity by Asimov. If you want to read up on the 3 Laws, buy ""I Robot"". If you want a combination of both for a younger reader, buy this book."
3,Melodic metal with catchy pieces,"Finnish melodic metal with really catchy highlights, but not enough of them to suit the picky listener. A good album all in all, but not one that truly stands out in a genre that produces lots of this. It's still clearly above average, though, and worth listening to."
5,Best Kalmah album ever,"If you're a fan of Kalmah or melodic death metal, buy this cd!!It is a must for any fan of that genre.By far the best record ever from Kalmah with 11 tracks of non-stop heavy songs and great mix of symphonic sounds and electric guitar."
2,Item received not the one pictured!,"The item I received when ordering this was NOT the product pictured. It was a window mount that did work with the same Magellan product, but was not the original one received with the GPS/ the one pictured! It does not work in the same way, and is not adjustable like the one I thought I was ordering. I'm keeping it as a back up but glued the one that was broken because it works better."
4,Money well spent,Arrived on time.Holding the GPS steady even with the unsteady temperatures that we have been having in Michigan.Highly recommended.
1,Windshield Mount doesn't Macth Picture,The item I recieved doesn't match the picture and doesn't adhear to the windshield. Suction cup is to small and just won't stick.
5,Wrong Picture But Same and Newer Product,"The item pictured is not what you get. However, you get Magellan's newer version of the mount and it serves the same purpose. Although it is smaller, it is capable of holding even the big 5 and 7 inch systems with no problems and seems to be made of stronger material."
4,magellan windshield mount,"Unlike the previous one that was supposed to stay attached to the windshield glass via a suction and never did, this one actually stays on the dash. Be sure you have enough flat surface for the large sticky-disc."
2,Good book but the edition is poor quality,"Nuvision Publications attempt to bring back ""formally out of print books"" that are still in demand, which is a great mission and one they should persist in. They go to the trouble of scanning the book and running optical character recognition software so that the text looks clean, rather than just photocopying it. Unfortunately, in some ways photocopying can be better; this book contains a number of comments in Greek, which were rendered as %&*#, or once as (Greek). There were also a number of places where the OCR had introduced lines or other errors. One read-through by a copy editor would have made so much difference to my pleasure in the book.It's a good book -- a cosy mystery, well if somewhat fantastically plotted. I'll look for a clean second-hand copy instead."
1,Another wild goose chase,"Almost immediate at the begining, the author lets Thorndyke declare 'if this gentleman should never reappear, dead or alive, the question as to what was the latest moment at which he was certainly alive will turn upon the further question: ""Was he or was he not wearing a particular article of jewellery when he called at the relative's house?""' The reader declares, 'the latest moment at which he was certainly alive will turn upon the further question: ""Does the housemaid recognize a picture of the alleged missing gentleman?""' Until the end of the story, the housemaid curiously has never seen such a picture, on newspaper or presented by the investigators. The novelists would say, a good disguise is sufficient. The readers say, not in reality."
3,Meow!,"THE BLACK CAT is a fine piece of regional, shot-in-Texas schlock a la S.F. Brownrigg and Larry Buchanan. Terribly acted, it still has the lonely, off-kilter atmosphere that only a lack of budget and talent can provide. I took points off for FAT, BLACK PUSSYCAT, a wretched murder mystery that distributors liberally re-edited in order to get playdates. A bomb in every department."
3,His Wife Would Drive Anyone To Kill,"Gads, talk about bimbos. The wife of the killer in THE BLACK CAT is as dull as they come and about as bright as a bucket of hair. An atrocious actress to boot, I'm amazed he didn't kill her in the first ten minutes. Unfortunately the viewer has to wait almost an hour before he finally has the good sense to take an axe to her. He's no great actor either, but he is more convincing than his tedious wife. This film definately features a cast from hell.FAT BLACK PUSSYCAT however is as fun a B movie as your likely to find. Quite watchable and silly and just chock full of them beatnicks."
3,Radio Spots,"Here's a list of the radio spots on this DVD: The Body Shop, Fiend For Flesh, The Female Butcher, The Girl Snatchers, Beyond The Door, Blood Feast, The Eyes Of Hell, Sex Fiend, and The Naked Witch."
3,Cat Double Feature is Cheesy Good Fun,"The double feature DVD of The Black Cat and The Fat Black Pussycat is not without its charms. Both are low budget features, though The Black Cat appears to be a ""no budget"" independent. The acting is borderline atrocious while the sound recording is poor, making it difficult to understand much of the dialog. I saw this film as an 11 year old in a local theatre and at the time it scared the crap out of me. Seen today, the film's special effects are crude though the gruesome nature of the story is still unnerving. The accompanying feature, The Fat Black Pussycat, is much more entertaining, though there are ludicrous plot holes and some badly staged scenes that might make Ed Wood wince. The acting, however, helps paper over many of these flaws, allowing the viewer to more fully enjoy the film as a whole. Together the two Cat flicks make for a nice cheesy double feature experience."
2,Couldn't stick with it...,"I picked this book up from a bargain bin somewhere, and tried several times, unsuccesfully to actually read the entire thing. I felt that the descriptions by the author were interesting and provided some good visualization, but had a very hard time discerning dream sequences, flashbacks, memories, current time, etc. The net effect is that I often found myself reading, not knowing what I was being told. Don't get me wrong, I love a book with lots of turns and perhaps convoluted plot lines, but this one went too far for me."
2,Look good but very weak,"They look great exactly as the pic would make you think, but in use they are very fragile. The antlers on one of mine came off with normal use. The other is still OK, so it may have been a weak manufacture or something, but be careful with them."
3,exploring shamanism,"peter weir is a fine artist and director (see also ""picnic at hanging rock""). this movie is an unsettling, penetrating look at a mysterious subject. one line from the movie provides an eerie summary: ""we've lost our dreams, then they return and we don't know what they mean."" selection of the didgeridoo was an inspired musical choice, heightening the other-worldly nature of the film. well done again, peter!"
2,The music was good.,This is another 70's movie that hasn't stood the test of time. Its mysticism seems silly now. The film is long on atmospherics and short on dialog and plot. In the first few minutes of the film you will see a young student injured by flying glass and the teacher completely ignoring her to go look out the window. What kind of teacher would behave like that? However the didgeridoo music was really cool.
2,A DUD,"This movie appeals to those, I imagine, who want to see Chamberlain when he was young and pretty. I prefer him more mature and a whole lot more entertaining."
2,disappointing,the story was just ok and the acting was fair but the quality of the vhs tape wasn't very good. actually the sound was terrible!!!!actually worse than a homemade movie.
5,A must for the sons and daughters of America,"Much of the workings of Karma may be learned by a study of the series of lives contained in the book. We see the interrelations of individuals, the results of benefits and injuries, the links that draw the egos together, the repulsions that drive them apart life after life and there grows a sense of security, of an ever ruling guidance, of Wisdom that plans, of Power that executes, of a certain working out of a great purpose, of agents chosen, tested, accepted or dropped, opportunities offered, utilised, rejected, of a sure onward evolution amid complexity of ebbs and flowsl.A single life is seen into proportion,, preceeded and succeeded by many others. A feeling of strength and dignity within the reader as he thinks:""I too have a long past stretching behind me, I too a vast future stretching in front"".The troubles of the present lose their seriousness when seen in the light of immortality."
2,Nothing special.,"I love Rasputina and own everything they've put out, and I consider all of their albums essential listening. Except this. The only ""original"" material are the two remixes, but they're of the same song and sound disappointingly similar. The other four tracks are from their first album, so if you already have that there just isn't much here. If the remixes were better, or of different songs, or if there was an unreleased song on the disc, it'd be a must buy. But it's not.I think this was released by the label to squeeze a few more bucks out of a new band using the then popular Marilyn Manson. Rasputina puts Marilyn Manson to shame lyrically and musically, and to have MM remixing Rasputina's music is truly ironic and sad.My advice - buy everything else from Rasputina, pass on this."
3,I'll agree with deadman_12,"The mixes are good, everything else is on the album. I love Rasputina, that is why I bought the EP, if you haven't head them than buy the album, it better."
3,"beautiful, but not monumental","Rasputina have a breathtaking way of combining three cellos, a drum kit and one beautiful female voice into a haunting, but slightly repetative (at least on this EP)sound. While easily listenable time and time again, it is quite short (approx. 28-30min) and the first two tracks hardly differ at all, both being mixed by marilyn manson himself. Definetly worth a few bucks though and most certainly a beautiful sound all around, i've yet to hear anything like it."
3,"If you 'enjoy' Marilyn Manson, you'll like Rasputina.","Transylvania Concubine is the best song I have heard in ages!!! And the mixes are really good too, unlike some (for example, Madonna's Ray of Light remix). But I didn't really like the rest of the songs on the CD. And I also felt there should have been more than just 6 songs."
3,dissapointing in the aspect that its become heavy music,"I am going to say I am dissapointed in this piece. I was looking for something more melodic and dreamy and I got MM remixing ""ancient historical"" music. I love ""Thanks for the Ether"". I am also a lover of History so this is ridicilous compared to my tastes which range from Loreena McKennitt, medieval Dead Can Dance and Harmoni Mundi label music.Melora, whats happened? Please don't dissapoint the fans that adore, love, the old fashioned cellos. Don't replace them with heavy drums, please! Stay old-fashioned.But it is too late......."
5,Loved IT!!!,"I loved this CD, yes, it does only have 6 songs, and 3 of them are basically the same song, but it was totally worth the money.I loved it!!!"
4,An awesome CD,"This CD is one of my favorites, to say the least. It's as if I was at a Ron Kenoly concert, even though it's pieced together from different recordings. I would HIGHLY recommend it to any one seeking good Christian music. I mostly enjoyed the first 8 tracks."
4,High Places by Ron Kenoly,"My daughter gave me the cassette of this album about 6 years ago butI lost it when I moved 4 years ago. Some of the songs would occasionalycome to my mind and I stopped procrastinating and researched the CD on theinternet and, thank God I found it on Amazon. Now playing and enjoyingthe CD very much...a true blessing!"
5,Great collection of spiritual songs,"Out of 15 songs I would say that 13 of them are great. Overall, the whole album is worth every penny spent."
3,good!,"This cd was a gift, after I purchased Hotel Istanbul and loved it. This is a pretty good cd, but of course there are 3 songs on here that are quite annoying. I actually do not have these three song on my ipod or in my computer, they're THAT annoying. Other than that, this is a great cd!!! I recommend listening to the samples at farsidemusic.com to get a feel of which Blue Asia cds you want to buy."
1,Scenery and Sets,"There are many reasons for watching--and ways to enjoy--a movie. In ""The Sicilian,"" these do not include strong performances by actors and/or a well-crafted film.The movie was filmed entirely on location and that is its greatest asset. If you are considering travel to Sicily or simply enjoy beautiful scenery and sets, viewing ""The Sicilian"" in lieu of a travelogue may be enough to overcome the rest of the movie's limitations."
1,Just try to sit through this...,"Absolutely some of the worst acting and story continuity I have ever seen. Christopher Lambert is not the only bad actor here - Joss Ackland as Don Masino and Barbara Sukowa as the Duchess are not much better. The dialogue can be so hard to follow, and the film jumps around so much, that towards the end of the movie you can barely (if at all) understand what's going on. Instead of spending more time on the ""why"" and ""how"" of Giuliano's campaign for Sicilian revolution, this film wastes time on smaller, less important scenes. One in particular, where Giuliano is robbing the Duchess of her jewels, and ends up frolicking in bed with her, is absolutely excruciating to watch - the acting and dialogue is that bad. Don't waste 2 1/2 hours of your life on this."
2,Well here are my thoughts,"Totally absent from this movie are things like1. Acting2. plot3. Some sort of rational story line4. half-way decent cinematographyPuzo is rolling in his grave this was just awful. A waste of a perfectly good blockbuster rental. Heck the movie did have some great nude sceans, so if thats your thing yo might want to get this.As for myself i'll read the book(agian)."
3,"Good scenery, weak drama","Lavish Michael Cimino film of Mario Puzo's ""Godfather"" sequel is rather incoherent and uninvolving, but worthwhile for the rich Sicily scenes. It helps if you know the story of the real Salvatore Giuliano."
2,Artisan does it again,"Amazing, isn't it? They somehow -- probably entirely byaccident -- put out the longer ""Director's Cut"" of thisterrific and hugely underrated movie, then destroy it witha careless, awful, cropped presentation. But then, theseare the people who advertised a ""documentary"" on their discof FIRST BLOOD -- which turned out to be nothing but clipsfrom that film."
1,"Garbage, I wish there was zero Stars",Don't waste your money on this.It is not worth seeing. It is an insult to the movie going public.I threw mine into the Garbage
1,Buy British!,Admirers of THE SICILIAN may like to know that the British DVD release (on the Momentum label) is both uncut and fully letterboxed!
1,ReadPuzo,"The casting in this film was terrible. Anyone who read the book will agree. Besides, the costuming was terrible. And how about the catch phrase? ""Before the Godfather..."" That's not really true. First of all, Turi's parents were living in New York helping Don Corleone before he was even born. Second, Michael Corleone was in exhile in Sicily and was going to help bring Turi to America. Part of the cursed story took place DURING the Godfather book/film. Ah.... i dunno. it just wasn't great."
5,Fantastic,Krystian Zimerman is a true genius. His interpretation of Beethoven's piano concertos is beyond anything I've heard. Leonard Bernstein is delightful as conductor. Beautiful!
1,Warning for under-age readers!,"I purchased this book because I enjoy parody and humorous fiction. However, I was utterly horrified by the graphic sex scenes throughout the book! It worried me that someone might buy this book for an underage reader not knowing the contents. The book was funny, but...."
1,Robert Kaplow is horrible,I think Lilian is a great writer. I love her books. I really feel like I'm their. Kablow is a KABLOW LOSER!!!
2,Not what I expected,"I've read ""The Cat Who..."" series for years. I appreciate a GOOD parody as much as the next person. But I didn't think this book was as funny as everyone says in these reviews. I found somethings mildly amusing; but overall I'd say it was mediocre at best. The story was so far fetched; it was a major disappointment. I wish I hadn't spent the money on it. This does not do anything for me, other than waste the time it took to read it. Thankfully, that didn't take very long. My advice: save your money."
1,"Lovers of ""The Cat Who"" should avoid this book","I found this book so disgusting that I could not finish it. I do understand what a parody is--but I feel it should retain the qualities that made the original pleasing to its fans. Mr. Kaplow obviously failed to notice that Lillian Jackson Braun uses no obscenities and creates her major characters [aside from the criminals] from civilized, basically decent molds.Ms. Braun's leading male character is an intellectual gentleman, not a lascivious ruffian--and I did not appreciate being told--on page 8, mind you, that, after ogling a busty young woman, heviolently indulged in self-gratification.This book should not be listed by Amazon beside books by Ms. Braun with the comment that people who bought her books bought this one--because few of her fans are likely to appreciate this travesty of her scene and characters.I am bitter over having wasted money on it that I could have spent on a good book."
1,Disgusting,"I expected this book to be in the same spirit as the other ""Cat Who..."" books--humorous and light-hearted. I found it to be disgusting and extremely misleading. I agree with the reviewer who said her copy was going into the dustbin. Mine is already there."
1,Don't waste your money,"This pathetic excuse for a book was absolutely horrible and a waste of time. I literally threw it away before I even got through the first chapter. Stupid, aweful, full of bathroom humor and just plain BAD!!!! Please, don't waste your money on this book."
1,Revolting,"This is the first time I've ever thrown away a brand new book. I tried and couldn't get beyond the first three chapters. I've read a lot of trash in my time, but it all had something to offer the reader. Not this!"
1,More poor writing than good humor,"I was very excited to hear that there was a parody book based on ""The Cat Who..."" series. Unfortunately, the book is not funny and not well written. The graphic (or pornographic) thoughts and actions of the main character as well as other characters didn't even seem to fit into the story. I suppose they were thrown in for humor, but like a comedian who must resort to using foul language to get a laugh; it was disappointing."
1,"Kaplow, go back to porn","I'd have to agree with other reviewers; the series has been going a bit downhill but this parody is not just downhill, it is right at the bottom of the cliff and if we're lucky, an avalanche will come along and bury it.Braun's series fits into the ""cozy"" category so the last thing I expected was porn And badly written porn at that. I read the first couple of chapters and skimmed through the rest. Did read the ending though. Spoiler here in case anyone actually decides to finish the book:Philip Roth as the murderer? Oh, please.I got this book from the library. At least I didn't pay actual cash money for it. I'd rate this as one of the five worst books I've ever read. Mr. Kaplow needs to look up the word parody if he ever decides to write one."
1,5 black blotches,"The author seems to take the idea of satire as an excuse to be totally and inexcusably gross. I did not expect a satirical look at LJB's to be a ""pleasant"" read like the books being satirized, but neither did I expect semi-pornographic descriptions used as the vehicle for whatever point the author was trying to make. Frankly, I gave up after only two chapters. I am only awarding a star at all because that is as low as you can go on the scale set up by Amazon."
1,Shameful,"It is shameful that Mr. Kaplow is taking advantage of Ms. Braun's good name - and the Cat Who. . . series to make some money for himself. She sells well, writes well - develops a plot, etc. Mr. Kaplow's story is male, college-freshman humor(?) He knows two ""f"" words - and how to satisy himself physically. His parodies are shallow throughout. COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!"
1,Pitiful Parody,"This sounded like great fun, but turned out to be a major disappointment. I found the writing disjointed, the plot garbled, the character(s) insulting and the ending a cheat. In stead of getting a sly, witty take-off on the Cat Who series, I got a mean-spirited dig at another author's success. Who needs it?"
1,disappointed,"I was very disappointe with this book.As a fan of the Cat Who...books, I can honestly say that I did not find the book enjoyable. I found it offensive, and did not finish it."
4,It was pretty funny,"It was pretty funny. It was obvious it was written by a male author because the main character, an aging male, was obsessed with sex, a detail female authors almost never include but men often do.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."
5,"IT'S A PARODY, STUPID!","A wonderful send-up of the Norman-Rockwell-like world of LJB! Where her books are antiseptically sexless and bloodless, this delightfully ribald and risque parody is filled with lascivious, odoriferous, constipated, semi-homosexual, desperate and crazy lunatics. Fueled by lust and hypocrisy! It's a breath of fresh air! A vicious parody that's exactly on target."
1,A CAT SHOULD KILL ROBERT KAPLAN,"A good spoof gets into the style, gimmicks, and the like of what's being made fun of and does so with wit and imagination. Robert Kaplan settles for the coarse, the vulgar, and other hammer-on-the-head adolescent humor in a supposed spoof that suggests he hasn't read anything more of Lillian Jackson Braun than her titles. He repeats his jokes, e.g., the list of gay bars, the violent masturbation, and the character who farts, three times in as many minutes--pause for ever more hilarious laughter after each fart. Gosh. Do a spoof of a Papal Mass by having the Pope go to the bathroom. Isn't that a scream! What's really needed is a sequel from Lillian Jackson Braun: The Cat Who Killed Robert Kaplan. Unless Dexter gets to him first--justifably."
1,The Cat Who Killed Lilian Jackson Braun: A Parody,"This book doesn't rate any stars. It is an insult to a gifted writer who has shared her talents with those of us who appreciate a good mystery that we can share with anyone in our families. This book's dialogue centers around a 4-letter vocabulary. I will gladly pay postage to return this book as I don't even want it in my house, let alone on the same shelf with Ms. Braun's wonderful books."
1,Not amusing,"Complete silly and insulting to all fans of cozy mysteries, real writers and plots. This ia a mismash and just not funny."
1,Yuck,"I wish I'd read some of the reviews before I picked it up from the library! I have no objections to paradies in general, but this is badly written. Like some of the previous reviewers, my main objection is the overt sexual references. It could have been very funny without being explicit. I mean, I loved the title. Guess I should have just stopped there."
1,Nauseating,"Amazon needs a zero star category for bools like this! I have a sense of humor, and can appreciate someone poking fun at some of the absurdities of LJB's book series, but this book was disgusting. It wasn't even a parody! All it was to me was an excuse for the author to talk about the male reproductive organ at every opportunity. That requires no imagination. The author more than made up for the lack of sex in LJB's novels, and sent me rushing back to them to clear my mind of the mental images left from his book!! I think perhaps the author hates LJB for some mysterious reason! YUCK!!!!!!!!!"
1,This is a giant stinker,"No stars preferred for Mr. Kaplow's unfunny, unoriginal, grossly vulgar and sub-sophomoric The Cat Who Killed Lilian Jackson Braun: A Parody. A successful parody requires wit, erudition, a sense of play, a shrewd selection of targets, and some actual humor. None of these are displayed in this sorry and needless massacre of innocent trees. If the author seeks to display venom, he has certainly achieved that. Unfortunately for him, he has also displayed the ""fulsome settlings"" of his inner mind.The Cat Who books are certainly not above parody, and they may indeed annoy some people enough to make them angry enough to write a biting satire. However, throwing a bucket of random names and manure over a general subject does not constitute a parody.Readers, Braun fans or not, can save money and have an equivalent experience by standing in a cow barn on a hot day and taking a deep whiff."
3,WARNING!! NOT FOR CHILDREN!!!!,"Although the LJB ""Cat Who.."" books are PG and for children, this parody is not for kids. Besides the detailed pornographic actions of the main character, the way she was murdered is pretty gross.However, the parody is terrific. The writing is funny. And every aspect of the LJB books are made fun of. For example:Instead of country town it's in NJ. Wholesome characters are far from that. And the cats are irrelevant when it comes to solving this case. Also, I found a great pun of LJB's style of using common items as murder weapons. Instead of butter knives or fireplace pokers, we have a shaver and dildo!It's creatively cleaver and fast-paced reading. But it can be disrespectful to serioius LJB fans and even perhaps her family?To repeat: NOT FOR CHILDREN!!!"
5,AN UNEXPECTED SURPRISE,"Tedious mysteries about precocious house-pets and geriatric detectives have little interest for me, so it was with some real pleasure that a friend of mine recommended THE CAT WHO KILLED LJB. As they used to say in the Sixties, ""it blew my mind."" It was funny, unpredictable, daring. Clearly not for everyone. And certainly not for dear old white-headed granny. But wickedly funny and mercilously satirical."
5,UNBELIEVEABLY HILARIOUS !!!,READ THIS BOOK BEFORE THE LAWYERS STOP YOU.ROBERT KAPLOW TAKES NO PRISONERS FROM OPRAH TO NORMAN MAILER THE BODY COUNT AND LAUGH COUNT ARE ASTRONMICAL.NOT FOR THE EASILY OFFENDED NOT TO MENTION THOSE WHO ARE HARD TO OFFEND.THIS IS THE MOST OFF THE WALL BOOK OF THE DECADE.
1,Pitiful Excuse for a Book,"This book does not even rate one star but that was the lowest choice that I had. All I can say is this is a pitiful excuse for any kind of a book. It is written by someone who was obviously hoping that by using the name of Ms. Braun and her book series he might somehow sell his book. If you can't do it on your own, don't do it. This is one book that I consider worthy of a bonfire."
1,disappointed in the shanachie company,"After returning this dvd to amazon because it would not play on my laptop, I received This dvd which still will not play on my laptop but later I found out that it will only play on a regular DVD player. I wanted to show it to some of my friends in their own homes who do not have a regular dvd player but cannot due to the way this dvd was recorded or produced - I am extemely dissappointed in the product. I've never had a problem such as this with any other dvd I've purchased from anyone, anywhere!"
1,Worst investment since AIG,"Well I guess my rating and title should tell the whole story..., unfortunately it gets way worse. First off this thing barely even fits inside my ps3 input.. it just kinda flopped around like a dying fish (and they sent the ""special modified version). Second it barely worked! The colors were distorted and there was NO SOUND for the first 3 days, but finally after plugging my cable wire into the adapter I finally got sound and a pretty decent picture, but that was only after some heavy rearrangements. And finally the 3rd spark that ignited the fuse attached to a big bomb of hatred I now have for this waste of landfill space came when I went to untwist the cable wire off my adapter... IT POPPED OFF!!!!!!! So needless to say this product is nowhere near worth the price and/or hassle. In fact I wouldn't accept this even if Amazon gave it to me for free and gave me 50$."
1,"Awful video, no sound from Xbox 360","Well, I wasted $10.11 + shipping on this POS. The video signal was awful and there was no sound when I connected an Xbox 360 to my TV using this MadCatz product. It reminded me of the days of rabbit ears when you would ask your sister to stand there holding the antenna so you could try watching a signal from an out of state TV station. Either I got a defective product or it just doesn't work. I would strongly suggest getting a generic RF modulator instead of one that is product specific like this one is."
2,Not as Pictured!,"Amazon did get this to me pretty quickly, but it is not the correct item. The one they sent has the XBOX, GAMECUBE, and PS2 plugs molded together and the XBOX 360 plug on a separate cord. The one pictured has all 4 on separate cords. This is no big deal if you are plugging in only one of the first 3 systems, but if you are planning to leave it set up so you can play any game system without unplugging cords, this won't work. It says it has automatic switching. There is no way this thing is going to unplug itself from Gamecube and plug itself in to PS2. I am still waiting to hear from customer service to see if they can actually send me what I bought."
3,get what you pay for,"This cable adapter is pretty much what I expected for the price, adequate. Plugs, leads and adapters e.c.t. are made cheap and replaceable. No complaints on delivery time or condition of mailed product or provider."
2,Problems,"I've seen and had one of these hook ups back in the day but this one was just eh. needs work and all the universal hook up such as 360,PS3, and Will connect."
1,Still Looking For One That Works,"I should preface this by saying that the version I purchased did not have the xbox 360 adapter and I sent it back. The seller reported that this was noted in the seller description that pops up after the universal description you see on the Amazon product page...and it probably was. I only read those if I am purchasing something that needs to be in a certain ""condition"" (games, books, etc.) I figured that a cable (which is what this is, for the most part) either works or doesn't, and that it wouldn't be for sale if it didn't work...but I was wrong. Just a note: Make sure you read the seller's description and that the xbox 360 adapter is included. My son likes to play his when we go on vacation (and the hotels never seem to have RCA connections), so that's why we're looking or one. And I know the reception is poor with RF, but it's only for a few days and, in my son's opinion, it's better than nothing."
2,not recommended for ps2 slim,the most obvious problem with this product is the size and placement of the plugs (i cant think of the correct terminology). i had to saw the xbox plug completely off in order to fit it to my ps2 (slim). luckily all i had to do was snip the wires off and wrap it in electrical tape to be safe. but really when u spend $10+ on a product u dont want to be doing surgery u want to plug it in and play.
2,"Not as pictured, can't use with PS2 Slim","I received the product today and when I opened it, I realized that it definitely is not as pictured. I was hoping it would be that exact one with the multiple cords so that I could plug it into my PS2 Slim and my XB360 without having to worry about unplugging anytime I wanna switch consoles.It works fine with the XB360. As far as with the PS2 Slim, I cannot connect the power cord to my system because the XB360 part of the cable blocks the port for the power cord. That means that they both cannot be connected to my system at the same time, meaning I cannot play my PS2 Slim with this RF adapter. The main purpose of my purchasing this cable was for my PS2 Slim.I am dissatisfied."
1,INCORRECT DESCRIPTION,"Does NOT work with the Nintendo Wii as stated!! ONLY compatible with PS2, PS3, XBOX, XBOX 360, N64 and Gamecube."
1,Utterly useless if you plan on using it for a PS2,"We bought this as it advertised it would work with a Wii, Xbox 360, PS3 as well as the PS2. I dont know about the old model PS2's but with the more common ""slim"" PS2's the 360 adaptor sticks out in such a way that you cannot plug in the power cable to the back of the PS2. So unless you have a very old PS2 its useless if your looking to hook it up. Very disappointing as now we must buy a second adaptor due to misleading info. This may be my last straw as far as MadCatz peripherals....."
1,a waste of $2.99,"Obviously no one edited this. Chapters start mid-sentence, this might be a rough first draft or the outline, maybe letters sent to his editor for review? If you want an interesting account of Mark Twain's experiences as a pilot on the Mississippi, get ""Life on the Mississippi"" by Twain. Shame on whoever released this. Not worth 1 cent, much less $2.99."
5,Works just as advertised,"I bought this to make sure my light covers kept that clear plastic look. I love Mothers products and enjoy taken care of my car. This Polish goes on easy you do not need a lot so this should last me the year. I use my microfiber towel to put on and another to buff it off, the clarity to it is crystal clear. Love this product and your car will look better for it."
5,Awww YE!!!,"I totally LOVE this here BAG! I want another one to use as my primary suitcase! It's huge and will even fit my kitchen sink!Anyway, if you're in the market for a gadget bag, this is the one for you. Unless you want something smaller..."
5,The Bag,"I purchased the bag with my digital rebel XT about six months ago. It's extremely well built, well padded with movable internal partitions. Enough roon to hold four lenses, a camera body, cleaning kit, spare battery and some filters. With all due respect to Alan, canon has never advertised this bag for carrying laptop computers, so the one flaw he found with the bag really doesn't exist."
3,Not FOr Me,"The construction quality of the bag is great. I found it was just too large for my needs. Another thing which I think we all need to think of is that is too conspicuous - meaning that it screams to potential thieves ""there is something of value in this bag!"""
4,"Big bag, works great","Works great, perfect size - Although its needing a few more inside separator pieces. It's hard to separate and add 2 cameras, 4 lenses in there. The smaller bag works better (since it comes with more separator pieces)."
5,great bag,"Bag is great for my photography needs, plenty of room for camera lenses, accessroies, etc. almost too big, but can also use in flying to carry some of your carry on items...."
2,don't buy this bag,bag is made bad...no wonder the bag is cheap.no room for flash or lens hood.I was hoping my 2 cameras body 2lenes 2 flashes n 2 lens hood would all go in this bag I was wrong.
4,Big bag for big stuff,"I bought this bag for my wife to use for her photography work and it works just as advertised. It is a big bag, housing the following (with room to spare):1) Nikon D502) 28mm - 70mm kit lens3) 50mm Nikon lens4) 70mm - 300mm zoom lens5) extra battery and charger6) extra SD cards7) 2009 MacBook8) MacBook charger9) Nikon flash10) lots of other odds and endsAll fits comfortably in the bag with room to spare. It's a big bag, so you might want a smaller one for those short trips, but it is great to carry everything you might want."
4,Robust and value,Very strongly built and due to the thoughtful design offers a very easy grip which is helpful to play it. The sound produced is not of the best quality maybe because the small metallic disks are not of the best quality. But has a very good value for money at the price.
5,Love it!,Out of all the Tams I checked out this is by far the beat value and excellent tone! And for $10!!! You can't miss!
3,"Great build and balance, cheapish jingles","The pros: Super-great price! Very well constructed! Excellent well-balanced design. Feels great in the hand. Lots of jingles.The cons: The jingles don't sound that good to me. A slightly cheap, tinny sound. I'm sending it back and getting a Rhythm Tech with nickel jingles. I think that tone will suit me better.It's not bad at all, really. And it's so cheap, on second thought I might keep it around for the kids. Or lean it against the door like a burglar alarm. Like I say, it's got a lot going for it. It just doesn't sound that hip, the way a good tambourine should. I wouldn't shake this on a gig."
5,Very happy with this tambourine,"This is my first tambourine, and I'm very happy with it! Very sturdy, feels nice in my hand, sounds great, cool, and fun. Ordered on a Friday, received 5 days later, on Wednesday. Really can't beat it for the price!"
3,Horary Astrology Plain and Simple,"Louis has wrote a very good book for anyone w/ some knowledge of general astrology. While the book touts to be a guide for the beginner to the advanced, I found it quite difficult w/ very little explanations concerning subjects like Almuten and Par degree determinations. Some of the calculations didn't add-up.All in All I would recommend this as an additional reference to a Horary Library if you want some historical reference and a list of fixed stars.What I would have wished is that Louis had given a walk-through course on the subject instead of compiling the plethora of information he did. I would have made this book a lot more user friendly."
2,"Sorry, Couldn't Get Into This","What I didn't like about this book is that the author talks about exotic concepts that he doesn't define or explain and has very unusual and abnormal examples. I recommend Barbara Watter's Horary Astrology and the Judgment of Events. She's a great writer, easy to read and explains all the concepts she introduces. Now her book is out of print, but you can get a near new copy thru Amazon resellers for about $45.00."
5,A terrific guide to horary astrology.,"This is a great book for anyone who wants to learn horary astrology. After years of doing natal charts, I am finally discovering how much fun can be had at horary. This book is a real eye-opener. It is a delight to read, enjoyable, and totally engaging."
2,A mixed bag,"John Frawley's ""The Horary Textbook"" is, in my humble opinion, far superior to Louis' book. I read Louis work several years ago, and found it ""anything but"" plain and simple. The chapter ordering seemed confusing, introducing complex topics early in the book, and explaining them only later.Frawley takes a more traditional approach, adhering more to WIlliam Lilly's methods. After all, Lilly was the acknowledged master of Horary Astrology in 17th century England. Frawley has the gift of making astrological concepts easy to understand, and he is also blessed with an entertaining wit.I'm sure others may prefer Louis, but Frawley's book (published in 2005) has more to offer, as far as I am concerned."
3,not clear,"I bought this book because the title states ""Plain and Simple"" but unfortunately, for me it wasn't all that plain and simple. I don't know much about astrology and perhaps with some background, I may have felt otherwise, but to me it just jumped right into interpretations without explanation of the calculations. I would say this book is not for the novice."
3,man of flowers,A rather dated Australian film but I enjoyed it as much as the first time I saw it. Some wonderful vignettes and rich colour
4,Man of Flowers - An excellent film,"With a bit of eye candy in the begining of the film, this film is an excellent film about one man's psychological problem with nudity. As a wealthy art collector he pays a model to strip to a clasical music score then departs to play an organ at a nearby church. The model starts to develop fellings for him.Depending on what you are looking for this is a good or bad movie to investigate. If you are looking for a lot of blood and gore, then don't waste your time. If you are looking for a little entertainment with the kids, forget it - the eye candy at the begining makes this not suitable. If you are looking for a nice dinner and a movie evening then this is an excellent one - just put the kids to bed first. If you are looking for a bit of eye candy then this is for you.It did not get five stars because the acting is a bit wooden."
3,Haydn and Mozart without soul,"Everything about this CD looks good on paper. Outstanding orchestra, famous conductor, top rank soloists and one of the most prestigious labels in the classical music world. So why am I am only giving this CD three stars? Simple, the performances are extremely sterile. All the notes are there, nothing is technically wrong but the music has no feeling. If you want both of these works, you can buy them on budget labels for the same money and get additional music as a bonus. The Discover International label has an absolutely outstanding Haydn Mass No. 10. I paid only 5 dollars for it. And there are many great budget recordings of the Mozart."
4,Calvin and Hobbs Meets William F. Buckley,"Prickly City is unabashedly conservative comic strip. And it's funny. The interaction between Winslow the ""Stub-Tailed Coyote"" and Carmen reminds me of Calvin and Hobbs but with a William F. Buckley patina over the whole thing (and Winslow's not stuffed and Carmen's a girl but you get the idea).It's not always political (Winslow's efforts to fly are a recurring joke) and it's not always hilarious but it's almost always thought provoking. The one bad thing is that the Sunday comics are in grey scale (I know, cheaper) denying us Stantis' great use of color. That's the only reason I didn't give this five stars.If you're not lucky enough to have Prickly City in your local paper, buy this book to learn what is so great about Prickly City. If you do have it in your paper (or read it on the internet as I do) buy this book to remember the great strips (and catch ones you missed)."
1,Shouldn't comics be funny?,"Prickly City may be conservative, and it's on the funny pages, but it is not funny. If you think it's hilarious that Michael Moore is fat, and if you think that talking about how fat Michael Moore is passes for wicked, insightful humor, you'll love Prickly City. If you think that Michael Moore's weight is beside the point, look elsewhere for laughs, because you won't find them here."
5,"Marketers, solve your dilemma!","Finally, a book that addresses the myths and misconceptions of doing marketing ""the old fashioned"" way. Advertising as we know it is obsolete...this is the age of cyberspace and the consumer NOW controls the marketing dynamic. These contributing authors (who by the way are seasoned business professionals who have been there, done that), have assembled an anthology that is truly a survival guide for marketing professionals of the new millennium."
1,Not to be trusted!,"If anyone wants to know why the US has a reputation for being less intelligent than the rest of the world, they need to look no further than this book. Reading through it reminds me of several exposé-type programs I've seen about surprisingly inaccurate school textbooks. I'll give one concrete example here; you can find the rest if you're unfortunate enough to own this book.According to p. 168, 1 quadrillion (1x10^15) BTU = 170 million barrels of crude oil. From p. 167, we see that 1 barrel = 42 gallons, so a quadrillion is about 7,140,000,000 (7 billion, 140 million) gallons.On p. 169, we're told that 1x10^15 BTU = 180 million gallons. There's a pretty large difference between 180 million and 7 billion. If the book isn't accurate on this small, easily verifible topic, how can you trust them on the more obscure ones?Don't waste your money on this book, and while you're at it don't waste too much on your children's textbooks either."
3,Water Volleyball,They work okay except that they are really hard. They hurt your wrist etc... when you hit them. Hopefully that will soften in time.
4,"Happy wife, but both me & the puppy doesn't care for it.","The item is nice & heavy. Feels pretty good laying on the pad, after heating it especially. The one thing I don't like is the scent, very strong unheated, even stronger after heating it. I got it for the wife, but both me & the puppy have to smell it unless we leave the room.It is authentic lavender smell, but personally I don't like lavender smell. For $20, it's not bad. Good material, good quality item."
2,there's better ones out there,"I've been using heat wraps/packs for a long time for my shoulder, neck, and back pain. This heat back is VERY flimsy and poorly made. Within one week of using it was already tearing away from the seam, i'm just waiting for the beads to spill out. Also, this does not retain heat for very long at all. I've had other heat packs that have lasted over 30 minutes, this one barely get's 10 minutes. I'm surprised at the good reviews. I would spend a little more money and go with the higher quality 'Dream Time' heat packs. I've had mine for a few years and it still works better than this one."
3,"smell good, but seam not sturdy",It's a good size and smells good. Seam is not strong enough though and broken after two months.
3,"OK story, nothing creative or special","Nothing delighted me, surprised me or made me chuckle. Edward was drawn to her from the moment he first saw her. Then, the tension for the rest of the book was Edward not following his heart. He could have found another woman for Freddie. Freddie didn't care. It was an ok romance novel that was easy to put down when I needed to go to sleep or to do something else."
4,VERY HOTTTTT,"Okay, i didn't give five stars cause the situation is so contrived and you really dont get a feeling of love between them although they do have sex a lot! Its just that during the emotional scenes, your heart isn't pouding or you are feeling sympathy with any of the characters, in short, there is a lack of emotion within the book. Although, the sexual tension and scenes are quite HOT and it probably boosted a two star book into a four star.I you like sexy books with quick action and get to the point sex scenes, then this is the book. If you are looking for strong emotional scenes that tug at your heart, this isn't the book. I didn't cry once in the book. I did drink a lot of water!"
3,So So Reading,"The plot sounded promising enough and it was interesting in the beginning. Florence is a perfectly lovely character. Edward I truly liked. The sex was hot and wonderful. Their relationship was coming along nicely. Then Edward's former mistress came between them. Until this time Florence had seemed like a reasonable woman, if a bit naive. When the evil mistress comes around spinning lies however Florence believes them! Why would she believe a woman she barely knows over the man who has been her lover? This is never explained well. Freddy, Edward's cousin, is a great character. I thoroughly enjoyed him.Overall, it's a decent way to spend your time if you don't need one of the main characters to be too smart."
5,Terrific!,"I thought this novel was first-rate, a really good read, Emma Holly is my new favorite romance author. I never read anything by her before; now I can't stop!"
2,Okay,"Yes, it was pretty steamy, but it just wasn't a page turner. Even the [physical] scenes were stilted - no romance or love, just mechanical [physical scenes].Edward plots to launch Florence upon society as his cousin in an effort to have her marry his brother, Freddie. The problem with this is that Freddie [prefers men], and although he loves Florence, he could never be in love with her. Edward is a different story, however. He spends the whole book lusting after our heroine, of course he getting her in the end.But the characters were so shallow. Ms. Holly tried to make Edward strong and sensitive but she only seemed to be weak and naive. And as for Florence, she isn't treated as a person for most of the book. Edward lies to her, spies on her, uses her and she just takes it. Sure, she gets 'satisfaction' from the [relationship], but her character is so two-dimensional and she doesn't get any satisfaction from the relationship...."
3,I Read This Book.....,"a few months ago. It was my first book by this author. I liked the relationship between the hero and heroine. I subtracted two stars because, unlike some other reviewers, I felt that the book was written with modern sensibilities in mind. I just didn't feel that I was being transported back to the time written about."
5,Wow!,"I thought this book was great. I know that Emma Holly's work gets mixed reviews, but I highly recommend it."
1,I Love The USA - CD-rom,"I'd like to review this item but cannot make it work in my computer - using Windows XP or whatever, that new program that sucks. Give us back Windows 98 Bill Gates!!!!! The seller did not send the case therefore I have no customer service information, I cannot call the maker to get information about how to set my computer to make it work....a little bit frustrating."
5,Wow,I think I had as much fun with this as our son did. We homeschool and we honestly spent 4 hours one day playing with this!
3,Review of Product,"I received the product, though the package was not in the best of shape, I was satisfied with the overall product."
1,"great, but pricey","Truffle oil is excellent, but this one itself is a BAD deal.3.5 oz is like a shot glass, a bottle of tabasco, etc.spend $5 more and get a 9 oz bottle.."
4,Brilliant Insights Amongst Generalizations,"I loved this book for its brilliant insights leaping out from most of its pages. Being married to an Indian and having lived two decades in India, I can vouch for the truth of the Indian psyche he describes in most of the pages. I kept taking notes of gems he described in such a wonderful way! However, at times the generalizations became tedious, as well as some obscure examples. However, all in all, a great read to widen understanding."
5,Superb! The best coming of age story in years!,"Though teenagers' coming of age/coming to grips with sexuality has been an overworked theme of late, NICO & DANI (""Krampack"") is a film which merits viewing no matter how tired you think you are of the genre. It has been a hit at film festivals worldwide, the film's frank and uniquely natural handling of the topic consistently praised.See it now. This is one European hit you will never see as an American remake (in our lifetime anyway). You will see why. And you will be treated to a warm and special film."
4,Great Friendship Story,"Nico and Dani was a great story for me, as Hollywood has long lost its appeal. This down to earth story of a couple of young guys doesn't wear the label ""GAY."" I perceived this movie as a peak into two young males exploring their sexuality as they grow into adult hood. Nico will most likely follow the path for women; Dani without a doubt, will follow the path of male intimacy and companionship. A fun movie with out all the Hollywood sensation and violence. Hope you watch and enjoy the story."
1,oddly homophobic story of gay love,"Dani, who belongs to an affluent family somewhere on the southern coast of Spain, gets a summertime visit from his old friend Nico. They hit on some girls at Nico's insistence without giving up their old pastime of krampack. When Dani realizes that he is in love with Nico, he begins acting like an idiot: he grabs at Nico's privates when he is having sex with a girl, tells the girl that Nico is really a maricon, then pushes himself onto the local mature, sophisticated writer but runs out before they hit the bedroom.What I find insulting about this film is that the boys never say the ""gay"" word, but they express their hatred of ""maricones"" quite often. I don't mind the director trying to pretend that gay history and culture don't exist, but it is offensive to tell a story about same-sex love that simulataneously preaches hatred of gay people."
2,Not completely bad but not really any good,"The two leads are effective, but this is a teen film and not a good one.However, the relationship between the two leads is worth seeing because of the not so clear feelings that arise. But the film does not delve into the questions it raises about how male teen sexuality is a confusing place even for those who know exactly where they stand on the gay/straight divide.RENT it and be prepared to sit through quite a bit of ... to get to the so-so stuff."
3,Call me shallow.....,"...I hate to sound so shallow, but ....I am afraid that I simply could not get past the fact that the Nico was just soooooooo unattractive. It made the story hard to swallow. The director ought to have found a young actor at least half as cute as the young girl that was interested in Dani. Either that or give Dani a pair of dark glasses, a cane and a canine assistant. Then the story would have been believable.~[: pp.s.My SO has asked me to mention that they both looked like they needed a good bath (but he says that about most Europeans)."
2,So So Nico,"This is kinda sexy in parts, there's a hand-to-hand scene if you know what I mean. But it's not a stellar story, or performances, and there is a flatness to the production which some might see as understated but comes off as film-schoolish in parts. There is a preachy backnote to the film, too, which is always a turnoff. It has it's moments, but not enough to recommend beyond a rental. I regret purchasing the DVD, but I was taken in by the adverts for it and the copies I got from Netflix were all damaged."
5,One of those few that really draw you in,"Young actors playing young men and doing a wonderful job of it. I was drawn into the angst, the rollercoaster of emotions, the longing, the confusion, etc. The movie is really an outstanding one. Well written, well shot and well acted. An excellent addition to any collection."
1,"good stuff maybe, bad program","Maybe there's some good stuff inside, but the interesting thing is you cannot even run the software smoothly.... Everytime when I ran the program and waited for get in that stuff, it just crashed down my computer!!!... There must be something wrong of its program....."
2,I did not like their solution gave me. I was not satisfy about this seller!,I did not like their solution gave me. I was not satisfy about this seller!I did not like their solution gave me. I was not satisfy about this seller!I did not like their solution gave me. I was not satisfy about this seller!
5,Glorious!,"This is one of the most beautiful recordings of the Brahms Sonatas for Violin and Piano available, and it has probably become my first choice among modern digital accounts. Dumay and Pires create a radiant and glowing account of these works, cocooned in a beautiful acoustic.My collection includes a number of outstanding recordings including Perlman/Ashkenazy, Szeryng/Rubinstein, Amoyal/Chiu, Suk/Katchen, Zukerman/Barenboim and Laredo/Pommier. If I had to choose one recording to represent these Brahms Sonatas to me, it would be this one, Dumay/Pires, or Perlman/Ashkenazy."
4,Measured Doses of Hell,"First, in the interest of disclosure, I provided a blurb for Mr. Campbell's book. This review, then, is something of an expansion of that blurb.Bill Campbell writes about troubling things: execution, abortion, family dysfunction. He is not afraid to take a stance on these issues, or to let that stance come through in his stories, but he seldom demands that you see things the way he does. He just wants you to give 'em some thought.Standout stories in this collection are ""Don't Cheat The Tooth Fairy"" ""Abortion Is Life"" and ""Fantasy Night"", but it's unlikely that any of them will leave you disappointed. In addition, Campbell has included the stage versions of several stories, and it's interesting to note the changes that were wrought in tranforming the original material.Fans of Stephen King, Richard Matheson, or F. Paul Wilson will enjoy this very much, I think. And I think we will hear much more from the talented Mr. Campbell"
4,Christmas gift,I bought this game for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves anything V-tech. It's very educational and she seems to enjoy playing the Cranium Party land Park game I purchased her for her V-smile. The game was used but still in great shape and I was very pleased with how quickly it came to me in the mail. This was a great buy. Thank you for making this purchase a pleasant experience.
5,Cute game.,Good game for young gamers. In my mind any game is good if they will play it for starts and if they learn something playing it. This did both.
3,Mark Pyle,"I found this book by doing a search for Mark Pyle as an author in a vain attempt at finding a tape called ""Death of An American Dream,"" which I know he is quoted on, but I'm not positive he authored. But, this book looks interesting. Anything by the last Clipper Captain is a good read to me.""Pan Am has place of it's own. You call it the world, we call it home."" Gone but not forgotten...."
3,Bitterly biased towards U.K. aircraft.,Beautiful pictures of aviation history and aircraft from all over the world accompanied by very biased editorial comments that do not belong in the book. American aircraft manufacturers are portrayed as the dark forces of evil
5,Melville Moose is soft and cuddly,"I love Melville! He is such a soft and floppy moose! He fits right in with all my other moose. You can't go wrong with Melville. He just looks happy, doesn't he?"
2,Decent overview. No depth. Info on MS website,This is a quick overview of reporting services and lacks any depth at all. Virtually all the information is present in Reporting Services Books Online or on the Reporting Services website. The book might be useful to someone as a quick reference guide.
5,"Finally, an informative book that fits in my brief case!","I enjoyed the book very much. I have been researching for more efficient methods to create and maintain data driven reports. ""The Rational Guide To: SQL Server Reporting Services"" provided an excellent feature and technical overview allowing me to make a well informed decision to move forward with implementing Reporting Services. The book answered many questioned I had such as creating and maintaining reports, SharePoint integration, security, multiple data sources, and many more. I also liked the numerous demonstration ""steps"", easy to read shorter format with examples and details, extremely well organized, called out ""Notes"", bonus material, and effective screenshots.It is refreshing to finish a technical book wanting more rather than feeling overwhelmed and exhausted, allowing me to spend more time working with the product.I am looking forward to reading ""The Rational Guide To: Building SharePoint Web Parts""."
2,Not good,"Well If you already have the SQL Server Reporting Services, just read the BOL. BOL is slightly better than this book!If you are a beginner and want to know about the Reporting Services, don't buy it, it's just a reference book, not a step by step book. If you already know how to use the Reporting Services and tend to forget how to do what, this is the book for you."
2,Not For Beginners,"While this book provides a very broad overview of SQL Reporting, a lot of detailed information is left out that will cause a good deal of frustration for the beginning user. With the lack of information, you often have to relay on the help screen information or Microsoft's web site to fill in the gaps."
5,Excellent introductory book,"Excellent book when you are new to SQL Server reporting services. It covers all you need to create great reports. A small bit of time spent reading it will save you a considerable amount of time tinkering around with the new product. You will need other books to get the most out of the product, but this book is your best first stop."
2,Too quick out the door,"Although the book is clear, it doesn't even come close to going deep enough. Rational rushed this one out the door to coincide with the Reporting Services launch. I see little value above saving one the difficulty of printing out the BOL."
2,Pretty much useless,"Don't waste your time with this book. You will get much more detailed information from Microsoft's website (MSDN Reporting Services). By the time the book was delivered to my house I already new more from the Internet then what the book contained. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it is the very first book on RS, and I guess if all you want is to see what RS is about without actually using it, it might be enough."
2,Achieves its objective,"Its a very low cost, quick-to-market overview of the product, and so I applaud Mr. Mann and the folks at Rational Press for that. However, its nothing more than a rehash of the Microsoft marketing information and technical documentation freely available from www.microsoft.com/sql. If you don't have an internet connection, then by all means by the book. Otherwise, you won't be gaining much at all by picking up this guide."
4,Worth Buying,"I would recommend this book to anyone trying to learn SSRS. The book doesn't cover all the bases. But then, I'd think you would be hard-pressed to find a book that does. After all, SSRS is difficult to use and poorly documented by MicroSoft. So, this book does about as well as can be expected. Don't expect to find information of dealing with all the quirks of the Report Designer - which, as I said, is a poorly-designed application. But, this book provides a good starting point."
4,A very good introduction to reporting services,"While not a deep technical treatise on the topic, this book will get those just starting with reporting services working quickly. If your evaluating RS for use and don't have the time for full fledged training, this book will allow you to install the server, configure basic security, and start generating simple reports. Keeping in mind that you will not find all the answers here, this book is succinct and delivers the essentials."
5,"Great, but need spare parts.","This is what every gas grill owner needs to get the proper high temperatures needed for steaks, chops, and even rack of lamb. Since you can't close the lid and slow cook, you definitely need a kettle or gas grill too. but stoke this baby up with lump charcoal, and toss on your thick prime or choice steaks and you will be eating very, very, well.Although I keep mine in a protected location, and have the grill well seasoned (or so I thought), wire brushing the grill knocks off metal flakes which end up in the food, and the bars keep getting thinner. Lodge does not offer a replacement grill-top, but I have written to them requesting one."
2,not adjustable,"I like its heavy duty compact design, but I miss the adjustabilty of the old style Habachi with height adjusting racks. I would buy the Habachi featured on the BBQ Galore web site, but it doesn't look as sturdy as the ones that were made in the past. Lodge definetly is in the ball park, they just need to modify its design."
5,Too Cool for Words,"I love everything about this grill and use it more often than both my Hasty-bake and DCS(what a waste of money)combined.In addition to what has been stated before,I also like it's portability.Those of you who live in windy areas know that can be a plus.I'm always looking for a reason to fire it up.It's that much fun to use.Also check out the camp cooker from Lodge.A marriage made in heaven.The perfect thing for stews etc."
5,Cooking on this grill is hot!,"This Hibachi is the real deal. I have owned this grill for 3 seasons now and it is still like new and I use it often to cook some great steaks or burgers. You can control the heat almost perfectly with the adjustable slide door. Want to give your steak a nice flavor without using an entire bag of charcoal... then this is the grill for you. Just empty the ashes out when your done, clean the grill top and then put it away. It will last a lifetime."
2,Yankee Engineering?!? Pah!!,"This product was designed by a neanderthal. Although robust in construction, it lacks features that hibachis selling for even 1/3rd of it's price routinely feature. It has only two grill height settings, and good luck if you want to change the grill height while the coals are hot. You will need insulated gloves or tongs to do so. I have seen dime-store hibachis with up to four grilling heights, and no worries about making a quick switch in height. The grill's iron legs tend to get very hot in use, so beware of placement on wood or other heat sensitive surfaces. The door to stoke/service coals is a useless feature. All in all, this product was a disappointment. It may yet enjoy a more useful life as a flower pot."
2,Overpriced - make your own or print something from the Internet,"It is exactly what it claims to be but way overpriced for a single pad of scoresheets. Do yourself a favor and search for ""free mexican train scoresheet"" on your favorite search engine. It will help you find something you can use."
1,Not worth the money,Too expensive and does not have the running total for the game.Will just copy on computer an older version of the score sheet which has total lines for each game . The older version seems not to be available anywhere . Locale printer made them for $1.65 but has retired .
4,Mexican Train Score Pad - plain but works.,"Mexican Train is exciting and fun. This score pad does it's job, but is certainly plain and simple for a colorful, dynamic game."
1,Score pads,"Not impressed with score pads. One was separated, & seemed not as full as the other. For the price, I would have thought they would have been wrapped.MEXICAN TRAIN Score Pad by Ouray Toys"
2,Too small,The pages on this score pad are too small to write in the numbers. There is no space to add up the scores until you get to the final score. Could contribute to errors in addition.
1,Robbed,"I ordered a score pad along with other related items. The $2.95 scorepad was sent separately and $5.95 was charged for shipping, Will I order through Amazon again??? NO WAY!!"
3,Games Hooray,Great game - hampered by the fact the battery does not work so we cannot make the train engine sound.
3,Score pad,"I am a little disappointed in the pads that I received.I knew what the price was when I ordered them,but was shocked at the small amount of score sheets on the pad for the price.Overpriced."
3,Only Double 12,Nice score pad but it only goes up to double 12. We play Mexican train with double 15 dominoes.
5,Bucking the Tiger,"This is one of the most fascinating, beautifully writtten ""Westerns"" I have ever read. In fact, I'd have to say it is one of the best BOOKS I have ever read. Period. If you know a lot about Doc Holliday, the subject matter alone will interest you. If you know very little, like myself, you will enjoy it not only for what you will learn about history of this character, you will bask in the language, which often reads more like poetry than prose. You don't have to be a Wild West fan to appreciate this novel, you only have to be a lover of serious literature. With this book, Bruce Olds has created a fictional character, rooted in history and based upon fact, that will endure for a long time to come."
2,MISS THIS ONE,"CALLING THIS A NOVEL, IS A MISNOMER...A HODGE POGE..MORE LIKE IT.JUMPING BACK IN TIME...THEN SOME OTHER TIME..SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY..STAY AWAY FROM THIS FAILURE IN WRITING"
1,Music feature does not work.,"I had the two slice Mickey toaster purchased at Disney World two years ago. Works great. Needed something bigger to accomodate our family's morning rush.I ordered the 4-slice from WholeSaleAV for Christmas. The song peters out half way through. Sounds like Mickey ran out of gas.I ordered a second Mickey toaster to see if it works better. It does not.I don't know if these are seconds and not expressed as such, but I would not order another one here. I'll buy one next time I'm in Disney World, so I can test it before buying."
5,Review Rock Harbor Series,This is an exciting series of books to read. I had a hard time putting them down for any length of time and could hardly wait to get to the next one.
5,"excellent as good as the first ine i read,","she is one excellent writter and spell binding when the book gets ahold of you it is very hard to put it down,i love her books and will share with others,"
5,Great Series,"It is easy to get lost in Coleen Coble's novels. They are fast- paced, well written and well researched. I would recommend anything she writes."
1,No stars!,This is nothing but christian preaching! I highly resent that the description of these book does not indicate that. Total waste of money.
5,"Colleen Coble, Keep 'em Coming!","This book, as the first, kept me flipping pages until I had finished. Fast paced, action packed, with unexpected plot twists and true-to-life characters make this book a MUST READ! For more of my reviews, visit my website at www.robinmillerbooks.com"
5,Exciting read,"Colleen Coble knows how to spin a mystery. I enjoyed this and her first book ""Without a Trace"". This is a great series, so far. Can't wait to read more. These are ""don't want to put them down"" books, so try to find a day to get the book in without interuption, if you can.PB - Morris, AL"
5,Maysa's Sweet Soul Classic,"Balto., MD native and former Stevie Wonder back up singer Maysa Leak does it again. First of all, this is a cover album. Perhaps this sets the stage for uneasiness, but after listening, there is no room for disappointment. Maysa is an authentic artist. Her sweet soulful silky sound is clearly her own. And for sure, it is her sweet silky sound that elevates these 10 soul classics to another level. The level of smooth and jazzy. Of course I am a believer in originality, and truly there is nothing like the real classic itself. However, Maysa's interpretation of these songs is not to be ignored. Give a listen to ""Come Go With Me"" and ""Love Won't Let Me Wait"". These are smokin' treatments!! This cd reflects some of what she listened to while growing up in Baltimore. Apparently she listened well. She does a very good job here. I appreciate the musical change. Soft/mellow/jazzy."
3,Disappointed,"I love Maysa, but I was disappointed to hear her cover so many other people's songs. One of the many attributes I love about her is her originality and I missed that on this album."
3,Not Maysa's Best Work,"I love Maysa w/ Incognito, and love her first solo album as well. This one left me a bit flat. These were all cover tunes, and my opinion is that if you are going to cover a song, you've got to do it different AND better. They were different, all right. Not much interesting happening, even Maysa's great voice seemed like she was holding back."
5,Saved my family's lives last night!,I have one of these. I am not sure it is the same model. It is a Nighthawk brand CO detector that looks very similar except mine is 15 years old. It sounded off last night at 100 ppm. We have a furnace problem. I moved it to another outlet downstairs and it read over 200. These were the same readings the fire department got.
4,What would you sacrifice to save your family?,"Abigail Faulkner is a brave, free-spiritedgirl who lives in Andover and soon finds herself caught up in the hysteria of the Salem witch trials. As the accusations of witchcraft spread, Abigail, her sister, and her aunt are all accused.I have always been fascinated by this time in history and wondered how people could have been so easily swept into this madness. The author, a descendant of the real Abigail Faulkner, based the story on some of her ancestors who were accused of withcraft.Excellent read, especially for middle schoolers."
4,good service,"This was purchased for an 11 year old. She has enjoyed reading it, Thank you for the good service."
1,Love NYC...dislike the book.,"In short.""I couldn't put it down..."". This book I could put down, but I finished it . As quickly as possible!A big disappointment."
1,Audio version a waste of time,"The book might actually be good. However the reading of it by Mr. King leaves a LOT to be desired. He is a fast reader which is hard to follow. He totally lacks the ability to figure out the proper inflections to tell a story. If you want to know the story, buy the book..... don't bother with the audio version."
4,Funny book,"This book reminds me of Carl Hiassen's novels. Quirky characters, clever satirical writing. A quick read that I enjoyed very much."
1,Mayhem without mystery,This book was a complete let down. I'm still questioning if the mystery part of the story was the climax. Where was it?
5,One of the most impressive books ever read,"I lost my copy of this book years ago and am so glad to have it back. Anyone who admires Polanski's work will love this book. Anyone who questions Polanski's love of life, Sharon, and the World he lives in should read this book. You will understand him in a whole new light. He's amazing. Read this before any other about him. Please!!!!!!"
1,unfortunately i never recieved the product as it was promise to me i dont trust amazon anymore.,I would have been nice to recieve it but i never did this seller never sent me anything will never buy anithing from this site again.
2,Could have been better,"In little less than 100 pages ( plus 85 pages for the appendix ) this book runs over the basics and history of arbitrage investing but it doesn't really go much into the thought process of arbitrage.The latter half of the book contains an appendix which contains infomation ( eg. price, profit, returns) of companies that were recommeded in the Gabelli arbitrage newsletter but no opinions on how the deals transpired or the research that was done to arrive at these recommendations.There's so little written about arbitrage investing that this book could have taken adavantage of it since Pitaro has years of experience with Mario Gabelli. This book could have contained informative stories rather than just be another book explaining the definition of arbitrage investing."
3,"Some obvious mistakes, crucial omissions","I learned from this book, and don't wish to seem churlish, but there are some obvious goof-ups that any good editor would have caught. For example, J.P. Morgan was ""John Pierpont,"" Morgan -- his first name was not James, desspite what you'll read here.Also, it was Theodore Roosevelt who enjoyed the popular reputation as ""The Trust Buster,"" not his successor, Taft. In general, don't trust the early historical portion of this book.I would have liked to see much more discussion of the public policy consequences of the phenomena Pitaro is discussing. For example, what should people in the other 49 states think about Delaware's dominant influence in the field of corporate law?"
5,Excellent,"Alvin Slaughter sings like he knows God. His songs and the presentation of his songs are so inspirational. It is so real. I felt like I was there. It is not show boaty, it is voices lifting up to the father in praise. Wonderful!!!"
3,Boring read,Extremely boring to read...it is a sleeper. I only have the book for a class and it is a good thing to read for people with insomnia!
3,Mixed Feelings,"I bought this album because I am a huge Anthony Warlow fan. While the album by-and-large is very good, if you are really only purchasing it for ONE of the three artists, it might not be the best choice-- I was disappointed to find songs I believed to be Warlow's divided strangely into duets and trios."
4,"The Main Event : ""Bloody good show""","First off I have to say this was my first time Amazon Marketplace and the service in general was excellent -especially since the item itself was actually Australian - and I was shocked to recieve it in the week! So the service is great!As for the cd itself - its a must have for all you Anthony warlow fans out there ( specifically the main reason I bought it :P) and it doesn't fail to please. The vocals are amazing and there's some great chemistry between the three singers onstage which is reminiscint of the style they we going for which was a sort of Frank Sinatra, Liza Minelli, Sammie Davis Jnr type thing - and in that respect it doesn't fail to please! I'd definitely like to see the DVD version of this up here cause it really great show!Not the first time I've visited the site and found some rare treasures like this one! Would reccommend this site and the product my numerous friends in university! :D"
4,good hoji cha,"I drink a lot of hoji cha (almost every day) and I enjoy this tea. It is a bit strong with sort of a grainy flavor, but still good. I recommend trying a dual brewing to see if you like it. 20-30 seconds of the tea bag brewed in hot water to bring out some body and then about 10 minutes of same tea bag infused in cold water to bring out the sweetness. A half a cup of each temperate water. Then combine the two. Works fairly well."
1,Hopelessly Watered Down,"If you want a very safe book that will not challenge anyone to learn new words or appreciate a style of writing that differs from today's, this is the one for you. The series divides L. M. Montgomery's The Story Girl into four short, simple volumes, all lacking the charm of the original.The Story Girl is not my favorite of Montgomery's novels, but it was one of her favorites; and as a reader of her journals, I can imagine her outrage at this simplified version that carefully removes all humor and substance. The new adaptation reduces the story to nearly nothing and the characters to stick-figures. Montgomery's novels could introduce today's readers to a different writing style, to new phrases and speech patterns; but this author ensures that will not happen. I give it one star because it is a clean book that at least introduces L. M. Montgomery's name; but if you want an enjoyable reading experience, stick to the original."
1,I want my money back!!!,This Bear Scout book is over 20 years old!! The copy right is 1990!!! How could Amazon sell something like this???? This is not the first time this happened. Last year I bought the Tiger Scout book and received an outdated version as well. I decided to give Amazon another chance and they sold me an outdated book again!!I want my money back!!!!This is unacceptable. I can't trust this company again.I am so glad I bought the Nook instead of the Kindle.
5,Great Buy!,Quality and ease of use is outstanding. We have been very satisfied with this product. We would buy it again. We have not had any problems whatsoever. The design is very appealing. The power cord tucks away nicely under the unit which makes it very easy to move around and store.
4,VillaWare Waffle Maker,I liked it so much a bought a second one for our seasonal home. It is so simple to use and clean. Just great
1,PIECE OF TRASH !!!,"For about 4-months, we were able to use our waffle maker on a weekly basis and it produced some of the most amazing waffles ever. However, suddenly the waffle maker simply would not heat up at all. I contacted VillaWare (the maker) and reported the problem. They replaced it with another one. However, the replacement failed soon after I started using it as well. It would not heat up either. Once again, I contacted VillaWare. They told me to take a hike because it had been more than 1-year since the date of my ""original purchase"". They felt that it was irrelevant that the replacement unit was in my possesion for less than 6-months. I will NEVER purchase another VillaWare product again. I am not surprised that the price of this product has dropped considerably. It is a piece of TRASH !!!"
1,couldn;t ship?????,I can not believe that you could not ship a item to Alalska- that is Lame........
1,Wonderful Waffles But Quit Working on The Second Use.,"We were able to use our waffle maker twice and it produced some of the most amazing waffles ever. On our third time using this product, The waffle maker simply would not heat up at all. There is another review with this same problem and Amazon sent them a replacement waffle maker. I am in the process of requestion that Amazon do the same for me. Will report back on the results of this request."
1,villaware v400 failure problem,"Well, I knew I wasn't alone. I was on my third replacement from VillaWare for this Waffler when it failed yet again in the same mode as before. All of a sudden it will not heat up. Obviously there is a manufacturing problem since the machine continues to fail in the same mode and from the other reviews ---it aint just me. I believe those who have not yet experienced this failure have simply not used it enough. Really, how many times does the average joe break out the waffler. Suprisingly, VillaWare is still selling this item when they must know it has this problem. VillWare has at least offered me any one of their products at a $90.00 value to compensate since I obviously don't want to replace this machine for a 4th time. PRoblem is, I don't like/want any of their other products. I strongly recomend avoiding this product until VillaWare addresses this problem. And yes, it does make exellent waffles when it works."
1,Too much description and details,This book did not keep my interest. I kept reading assuming the story would get better. It did not. The writer gave a lot of information about past events and medieval times that were not necessary and took away from the actual story. Hambly seems to get the readers involved with the setting and background information. I prefer books that get the reader more involved with the characters such as in the book Eragon by Christopher Paolini or any of the Harry Potter stories by J.K. Rowling.Dragonsbane is an ordinary book that might be interesting to those that are interested in medieval times. This book would not be interesting to anyone that likes more dialog between characters in a story.
4,Good book...worth your time,"This was a very entertaining book. Good use of detail but sometimes there was too much at climatic parts of the book. The characters were well rounded and believable. The ending was very good. I didnt know how the book was going to end. It was an unpredictale book, which I like. This is a must read for fantasy/sci-fi readers. The sequel is quite good too...though i havent finished it yet...so buy both!"
3,Good read,I'm comparing this book with all the other books of her's I've read...and I've read most of them. Here is my take on it and why I gave it only a three stars.Pros:1) Great idea on dragons and dragon magic2) Some focus on gnomes which aren't normally a race that plays a lead part in any way3) Some enjoyable characters that you tend to care about4) We always like how characters learn of themselves...especially in the area of untapped magical potentialCons:1) Lot of untapped potential for suspense2) Lot of untapped potential for increased political intrigue3) Would have liked more play-by-play action when the dragon and the Dragonbane actually fight.4) Felt that some of the dragons thoughts/talk wasn't what I expected...too human5) I have little interest to read the following two books because the ratings are so poor. I would like to enjoy a continuing story but will pass up on the next two books because of this.
5,Hickory Dickory Dock ....,They dont make 'em like this anymore --- this is vintage Dice. You'll laugh so hard your face will hurt. Get it!!
5,Dice still Rules,"What can I say. I ordered Dice Rules off of PPV back in 1990 or 91 and recorded it VHS. Could never find it on DVD once that format took over. Great to watch, still funny as hell, (the ""Day in the Life skit was a riot), and he still is the Undisputed Comedy King"
2,DISAPPOINTED,"THIS WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING...THOUGHT IT WAS JUST THE STAND UP AT MADSION SQUARE GARDEN, BUT HAD SOME REALLY LAME MOVIE ALSO....STAND UP CONCERT WAS OK THOUGH"
2,not quite worth the read,"the first two books in the series were very good and i was looking forward to more of the same with further tales of the city but instead was left very much dissapointed in how weak the plots were.also leaves a gap from where the 2nd ended. somee ques i have are what happened with mona? and hhow did brian end up with mary ann? what happened to jon?i dk why but after reading this, all in all just left me cold and unsatisfied."
4,A Compelling Continuation...,"...but, perhaps Maupin should have left the characters with at least trace amounts of who they were when 'Tales' began. I am impressed with the consistancy of the story, however. He can spin a 'Tale' better than anyone I know! Have you noticed... These people are, in essence, living your life sometimes? There's a reality there that not just anyone can manufacture convincingly. All in all, a terrific sequel!"
3,Reading San Francisco from Paris,"French as I may be, I very much enjoyed the third volume of the Tales. The characters are pretty consistent from one volume to the other, even though they tend to change - but then, don't we all? Paris, year 2000, might be far from San Francisco in the eighties, but the very human stuff this novel is made of goes way over and above the boundaries of languages and countries. The ""added value"" over my little straight life out here lies in the thriller-like quality of some of tales in the Tales. Very enjoyable!"
5,A wonderful journey goes further on,"Reading the 'Tales of the City'-Series was such a wonderful experience I could easily repeat it as much as I could. Maupin's style is so great and terrific, it's strange I hadn't heard of him that much, before I read it.The characters are surely some of the best ones ever created in literary history. The developement of the storyline is so surprising and unexpectable it's breath-taking. The twists and turns are so effective, because you seem to know the characters so well, and never had thought... well, you have to explore the secrets by yourself. I have never seen such a developement of characters. The same persons are totally different in the last book than in the first one. It's great.I won't rate every book differently, although they are very different. But they are so great alltogether and so well-connected it's hard to tell them apart.This is wonderful stuff!"
5,I want to move to 28 Barbery Lane!,"Oh those gay 70's days in San Francisco when ""cherez la femme"" ruled the original Pink Village. Armistead Maupin revealed a zany twist of relationships in the most liberal city during its most liberal times long before the late 90's tech boom. Tales of the City depicted just how much ahead of the times San Francisco has always been."
3,"Charming and Fun, Easy Read","Having never read the preceding novels, I wasn't sure what to expect from Maupin's writing style. I found it easy to read, and he really seems to care about his characters. Although the plot gets pretty unbelievable, it was fun to just say hey and go with it. An especially fun read if you live in the Bay area. Would make a great novel to bring to the beach."
3,"Not as good as first two, but give this one a chance!","I absolutely loved the first two books in the ""Tales of the City"" series. ""Further Tales"" was more difficult for me to get into and care about the characters. However, once I did get into it, I was rooting for the characters (especially Mary Ann, DeDe, Brian and Mouse). The last part of the book was very suspenseful, especially the ""Bambi-in-the-basement"" scenario. All in all a very entertaining and suspensful book which, like the second book, made me cry in some places.I'm trying to find people I can discuss these books with!"
1,This is a HORRIBLE recording!,"This recording is very BAD! Stay away from it. Studer is not ment to sing Violetta. She does not even sound as if she is into the part. Pavarotti was ment to sing Alfredo, just not here! He is still one of the best Alfredo's around, but this recording he sounds bored and not into his character. Juan Pons is great as Germont, but just because he is in it, its not worth buying this bad recording. The orchestra under James Levine sounds, for lack of a better word, weird! It does not sound full, but not to small. Very bad reading of one of the very few Verdi opera's I like."
3,Too Heavy for my Mum,"They look fantastic, I bought them for my mother who had a fall. She said they are lovely and warm, but can't walk in them as they are too heavy. So, she wears them whilst sitting watching tv. Mum is a small framed woman with osteoporosis. I hope this is helpful."
1,I thought it would never end....,"The reader will have to plod through 250 pages of contrived situations (and not very interesting ones at that) for our ""hero"", Jack Durrant, to tell Constance that he, oh yes, loves her. For some reason, he did not think he had to and that is why he wants to marry her. Now, thankfully, this book which I thought would never end, does."
4,Frame of Mind-Riker's 'Total Recall',"Riker agrees to become part of a play that Dr. Crusher is directing. Later, we find that he is on a planet, captured and the play matches his incarceration. The whole episode questions whether he is captured, just acting, or dreaming it all. Great episode!"
5,Mothers car care,Mothers 06624 Glass Cleaner - 24 oz...........is in a class of its own.......a brand i will forever use on any vehicle or suv that i own
4,Does the job,"The 24oz bottle is a better value and can get more uses out of it. As far as cleaning, it gets the glass clean but not streak free. The more dirt and moisture is on the cloth you are using the more it tends to leave streaks. I clay the glass before using the cleaner to get better results.Mothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System"
2,Decent DVD but doesn't really work,"I got this because my dog has some serious seperation anxiety and I thought that this would help him but he doesn't really watch it. The first Dog Sitter DVD actually got his attention much better and the guy in this video saying ""good dog"" throughout was kind of creepy. I have heard this worked for some dogs, but didn't work for mine."
1,Barking Dogs,I was disappointed that the video was really just a tape of a dog obstacle course -- with a sound track of barking dogs. I didn't find it very creative.
2,A doggie no no.,My dog didn't pay much attention to this. I wouldn't buy it again. It was too boring for her. Mhm.
1,Total waste of money,Do not waste your money! Awful video with poor quality. I can't imagine this working for any dog. My dog looked as disappointed as I.
4,OK But First DVD Better,"The DVD was OK, but the first one was a lot bettter, the first one my dog watched, this one causes her to bark a lot !!"
3,Okay reading for suicide survivors,"The book is good, but Carlson kept losing me when the story of her son turns into a textbook for teachers. It does, however, have some strong points for anyone who has ever lost someone to suicide. A ""Good"" Book....."
3,There's more to Bipolar Disorder than Suicide,"This is a touching story, but suicide isn't the only aspect of Childhood-Onset Bipolar Disorder. This gives some good information, but isn't that well written. There's a new book that has a lot of practical information in a very usable format that addresses the daily challenges of Bipolar Disorder, not just the suicidal tendencies, much better. It's called ""If Your Child is Bipolar."""
3,How adults can recognize suicidal symptoms in children,"Through the moving story of one victim's life, the author illustrates how caring adults can recognize the symptoms that threaten a child's life."
1,Awful Music and Substandard Dancing,"My dance teacher recently rented the CD version of just the music to look for some ideas for new dance items, and we came across this AWFUL recording. The singer, who sings ""light music,"" is just awful, and there was no sophistication in the execution of the pieces. The jathis in the varnam were a joke, maybe one step above an adavus class, and the singer just killed the song.Likewise, when I actually saw the DVD, I was just appalled. She hardly had any stage presence and her face always seemed frozen. Her movements were mediocre, and she didn't really have much maturity in her dance as one would expect of a performer her age. There was no bhava in her abhinaya, nor did she exude a sense of enjoyment out of what she was doing. Perhaps she couldn't stand dancing to the music ;)Conclusion, please do not buy this DVD...if you are interested in learning bharathanatyam, seek out a teacher. do not use these items in an aragetram or you will surely kill the audience ;)"
2,Definitely not worth it.,"I purchased Padma Chebrolu's 2 DVDs many years ago. The vocal music is not great, and her dancing is not up to par with professional dance Guru's that I know personally (in the USA). Regardless of where you live, don't be fooled into settling for this instructional DVD.As a dance teacher, Padma's expressions and dancing are very sloppy. She does not appear confident and is off-beat sometimes. You can find plenty of other amazing quality Bharatanatyam dancers in the US. Padma Chebrolu would not even be on my Top 25 list. Hopefully I can re-sell my DVDs one day because they were a waste of time! The only thing that the DVD does well is explain the meaning of some songs."
5,Must have for dance students,This video is must for those who are learning or plan to learn classical Indian dance. It can be used to learn the aspects of the dance which are usually communicated by a teacher to a student and due to lack of access to teachers it is difficult for a young student to absorb the minutae of Indian dance and to understand the basics. This DVD allows for the student to absorb at a pace that can be set by the student and not the teacher. I would strongly recommend this in addition to the audio dance CD by the same dancer in preparing to learn the songs as well as the basic movements and to acquaint the dancer to the songs of Bharatanatyam.
2,"Regarding authenticity of ""Bharata Natyam""","I somewhat disagree with the previous reviewer (Raja Srinivasan). Padma Chebrolu does know a bit of what authentic Bharatanatyam is.Even if this DVD can hardly compare in ""authenticity"" with DVDs like Natya Samarpanam, at least, unlike Anita Ratnam (who also released a Bharata Natyam DVD), Padma Chebrolu does not write something like:""...am also very happy to see a good student of our guru Sri Adyar Lakshman continue the parampara. I know that SIr is always asking me to 'return' to Bharatanatyam, but my journey has gone too far away to return.""(taken from http://www.narthaki.com/bboard/messages5/20829.html)"
5,Great for practice,"For a consultant like me, always on the move, the ""Dances of India"" series is the next best thing to instructor led classes.I started with the basics from the ""Learning Bharata Natyam"" dvd, which details all the basic steps and Mudras.The Arangetram dvd is excellent in both instruction and quality."
3,Good to have one,"There are not many Bharatnatyam DVDs out there, and, if you have the cash, you should get this one for your collection - it is worth having as an intro into an adapted version of Bharatanatyam.Although the performer is not in a good form, and although the items are incomplete here, unlike, for example in Sreelatha Suresh DVD or Nrithya Madhuri DVD, still we have to admit that David Morrison's production was superior in image quality."
2,Sub standard performance for an expensive DVD,"I am surprised one can even venture in making an DVD with such an substandard music and performance.There was not even one teermanam displayed correctly by the dancer leave alone by the mridangam.All the main items are cut short so badly(tillana 7 minutes give me a break).....If this is the intention ,it is better be priced accordingly.I didnot enjoy even one item ...My strong suggestion is not to buy."
5,Great,This was exactly what I wanted for my daughter. She loves it. I think the best thing is that she can see out of it while crawling through it.
3,"Fun, but not strong","My little girl is going to be 2 years. I bought thi when she was 15 months. She loves playing in the tunnel, but this has several snags already on the mesh side of the tunnel. I like the extra length, but I wish it was little stronger."
5,loads of fun,"my 10 month old granddaughter just loves this tunnel.Our little neighbor, who is one year older, did not like her own tunnel as it did not have the mesh see-thru..but loves this one. Will be purchasing more to give as gifts."
5,So much fun!,I bought this tunnel with the four person tent for my 19 month old daughter. She loves it... My husband and I can actually play inside with her. She can fall into it and it will move with her so she wont get hurt. It is light weight and folds up easy. This was a great investment and we all have so much fun with it!
5,fun for all,Even Gramma enjoyed playing with it! My baby is 10 months old and totally lit up when I got the tunnel out. He loved crawling back and forth inside and touching all the colors. Seems to be well-made also.
3,"Fun toy, poor quality",I bought this for my son's 1st birthday July '11 and he loved it. Literally less than a month of having it the material was tearing and wearing by the metal rings that make the tunnel. Keep in mind my son was 12mos (so not too rough with it like a 2 or 3 yr old may be) and we had it outside so he was playing with it maybe 4 times a week. We've had it now 5 mos (inside now) and every metal ring is showing because the material has worn through. He still plays with it and loves it but it's on it's last leg and we've only had it a few months. It's a shame because I wanted to buy the tent that connected with it but I decided not to because it will probably fall apart.
4,Tunnel,"This is a great way to have fun with your children. Perfect for the whole family, and for helping an autistic child."
4,Great so far,"Our 10-month old baby has a lot of fun with this product...so far. I like the 1/2 solid, 1/2 mesh design because you can play 'peek-a-boo' while your child crawls, twists, and rolls down the tunnel. There are a variety of attachments too, which will add to the fun as our baby gets older. We've only had the tunnel for a few days, which is why I can't say anything about its durability. Overall the product has little academic value - some spacial perception stimulation, but I think the true benefits lie in its creative/imaginative 'play factor' as well as physical development. Encouraging children to crawl goes a long way for physical coordination and wrist muscle development (so I have heard from occupational therapists)."
1,Warning: Obnoxious smell!!!,We received the play tunnel today and we are returning it tomorrow as it smells very strongly of gasoline. We could smell it before we even opened the box and it just got worse as we took it out. The tunnel also seemed to have a oily feel to it. The strong smell gave us headaches and we wouldn't think to let our children play in it!
2,Falls Apart Easily,"This tunnel is great fun for both my 4 year old and 11 month old, but after having it for only 3 months and playing in it only a few times a month, it has started to fall apart. The metal spiral has poked through the fabric and is sharp. It is no longer safe for use. The stitching on the other side that contains the metal spiral has also started to come apart. I am very disappoint in the quality of this tunnel. When we first got it everything looked great and I was hoping to get a lot of use out of this. I guess not."
3,Fun but not well made,We had our tunnel for less than 2 hours before I noticed the stitching coming apart. Once that fell apart the metal coiling was exposed. The metal coil inside IS padded however if your child has his/her forearms on it for anymore than a few seconds it can be somewhat uncomfortable!! I think it was a great idea that was cheaply made or either we just got a dud!! I hope someone has had better luck than we have!! Have shopping:)
5,Exactly what I wanted!,"My kids have a tunnel at school that they love, so I was on the hunt for just a tunnel without the tent. This is perfect, and I love that I can see them while they are camped out or barraling through!"
1,very poor quality,"There are so many loose seams. When you drag one seam, it comes apart fast. I already find hole in the binding area showing inner padding within the first use on my soft carpet(5 minutes). It is NOT durable!!!The tunnel I received also contains blue ball pen writing on the tag. Is it a used or returned product? I don't know it was previously used by a pet or not. There was an area of light yellow stains I'm not able to wipe clean. Is it urine from a pet? I need to clean it before my baby use it. Baby likes to taste the tag. I cannot clean the ball pen writing on the tag either! Who did that?It is sooo cheaply made. It shouldn't be 30 dollars. I have to go through all the hassles to return the product. What a waste of time!I cannot believe the other good reviews. It seems as if my pacific tunnel was made by a cheap low pay factory with poor sewing ability. The other reviews are out-of-date!"
1,scared;; frightened,"i bought this for my 2 year old Niece.after setting it up , tried to entice her to crawl through it.no luck. all she does is bawl and try her best to get away from it..only thing i know to do is keep it and try when she is older"
5,Great Tunnel,"We bought this tunnel for our daughter's first birthday. She loves to crawl under things, so we thought this would be great for her. She was a little unsure of the tunnel at first, but soon realized that she could crawl through it and play in it. Now she loves it! Her cousin (2 years) also loves playing with it. I would recommend this tunnel--I love that I can see through it and see where she is."
5,Great for crawlers,"I got this for my 9 month old who has mastered basic crawling. She loves to have her ""secret"" hideaway and I love that I can still see her. She'll pull toys or snacks into the middle of the tunnel and play. We have fun as I chase her through the house and she always makes the tunnel part of the route. She just learned that if she faces towards the fabric, she can crawl and use it like a hamster ball. Sometimes when she crawls through, I start to move it side-to-side for a challenge. She really enjoys compensating for the movement."
4,My boys enjoy playing in it,"We gave it to our son on his 1st birthday and he loved it right from the beginning. His brother (2 1/2 years old) enjoys it too. I'm glad that I got one that has the see through mesh so that I can monitor their play. They are usually in it together. They also like me playing with them and the mesh helps with that.I only gave it 4 stars because it doesn't hold their attention for a long time, usually 30 minutes at the most."
2,"Started Good, Ended Poorly","As a die-hard comic fan, I was extremely interested in this book after reading the preview of the first issue. Someone had finally gotten it right, I thought. It focused on T'Challa as a king, first and foremost. However, the story soon degraded into something else entirely. Hudlin completely distorted established characters, and even completely changed others. This offended me as a comic book continuity freak. The stereotypes offered for both white and black characters managed to offend me as well. The art in this book is pretty good and if you dig a little, you can even find a palatable story. My recommendation is to skip this book. Pick up the collected Kirby Black Panther and the Priest books and enjoy."
3,see it!,i didn't think that this movie was as bad as everyone made it out to be but i must say that without the leading man (Rodney Eastman) there would be on movie! he really set it off!!love ya rodney
3,So the Visitor Moved On,"I've been searching for this movie since I was a kid. I finally found a DVD version and re-watched it. It wasn't as great as I remembered - terrible music, awful acting and special effects - but it's a cult classic and I kind of like it even though it's garbage. If you are in to watching old crappy movies you might like this, otherwise you should skip it."
3,A Can of Peas,A very pleasant story of nice people and how their lives are interconnected in a small Minnesota town and the small ways that God leads us in our lives. A nice book for accompaniment to iced tea on the porch in the summertime.
2,I wanted to like this book...,"I'm sorry, but this book was just okay. It was a very slow read, and the characters were just not developed fully. It wasn't a bad story, but don't expect much to happen. I did not care for the ending. The mood was too stark of a contrast to the rest of the book."
2,Borrrrrrrrring main character...left me wanting more!,"I found the main character to be a spoiled, self-centered brat. Every other character was developed and interesting, but she left much to be desired. I found myself caring less and less about her ""plight"" because really, it wasn't a plight at all.As an aside, I didn't realize this was considered Christian fiction until I read other reviews."
4,"Lures you in, and leaves you wanting more","This lovely little first novel focuses on a Middle Western couple who leave the big city to run the ancestral farm. I was quickly drawn into their lives, as well as the lives of Lake Emily's citizens. The story is sweet without being cloying. Mae's struggles, both maritial and spiritual, felt genuine and believable to me. The book has some weaknesses. Some of the writing is awkward and Mae's relationship with her mother seems less than plausible. But for the most part, the characters and setting rang so true that I felt as if I had experienced them myself. I found myself thinking the other day ""Now what does this remind me of? Mae and Peter's situation, of course."" I'd forgotten for a moment that they were character in a book, and not people I'd met. Which is high praise, I think. I look forward to the DePree's next book."
5,A Can Of Pleasure,A Can of Peas by Traci Depree is a most inviting book. The characters are so real in a small town way. Peter and Mae are newly weds trying to find their way and their purpose in life. They come to Lake Emily to Peter's grandfather's farm to start their dream. They are so endearing to the reader. Their lives are met with challenges one after the other but they have good values and tenacity to struggle for their dreams. All the characters have good solid substance and you are drawn into their lives as though you are there. Traci Depree has found her way! I can't wait to read her next book.
5,Peace sense of living.,This book made me think of the good things in life and gives you a peaceful feeling...you cannot put it down...makes you want to be a farm wife like in the story...they knew what really living is all about.
1,Minimal Plot,"Although this book is cozy, it could have been so much better. The plot is a simple story of a couple who become farmers, which is interesting if you enjoy learning about farming. But there are no subplots. There is nothing else going on besides the farming. Nothing to make you want to keep reading. It basically is a bit boring and nothing at all like the quality writing of Jan Karon."
1,UGH! Sappy and Whiny!,This book was a complete waste of my time. I found it to be sugary sweet and sappy. This book proved to me how hard it must be to write an articulate novel. Better luck next time.
1,Not for the fast paced northeasterners,"This book is blah,predictable and lacks any drama. As part of our book club reading we were trying to get more meaning out of this christian fiction. This book is dull,immature writing and the characters and plot are too obvious. Our real lives in the northeast are much more exciting then this goody two shoes farming story."
2,A real disappointment,Did not like this book. Selfish female character. Good male character. Loved the town and its people. Learned allot about farming. It is hard work. Need an understanding wife. Did not like the book ending.
2,Be Forewarned,"Be forewarned, Traci DePree is the Pat Robertson of barn yard fiction. Think born-again Jane Smiley on ecstasy. This story was so sticky sweet I had to brush my teeth when I finished. Barely a page goes by without an in-your-face reference to the big fat ""Hug me I'm a Christian"" pin each character wears on their sleeve. That said, I did manage to enjoy this story but I'm just a sucker for the all-to-rare farm fiction. For the other side of the coin (i.e. real-life farm story without the sugar coating) try ""A Thousand Acres"" or ""Prodigal Summer""."
4,A Pleasurable Escape,"Traci DePree whisks her readers from the busy hubbub of city life and takes them to a small town for a poignant look at Minnesota farm life. Among hardship, pain and death, we also see hope and God's blessing. Vivid scenery and endearing characters hold the reader in quaint Lake Emily through Peter and Mae's first year of farming. DePree weaves decades of history into the book, giving it many rich layers to enjoy. From calving to County Fairs, haying and romance, we learn to love the little town as much as her inhabitants. Peter and Mae learn a lot more about life than just when to plant peas and corn--they learn to hope in God's timing for all the abundance He's promised."
5,What a wonderful simplicity this book contains,"Real-life characters in over their heads, but trusting in God and community to pull them through. The small-town virtues of honesty and hard work. The toughness it takes to make a go of it on the family farm. And the tenderness needed to care for those who've entrusted their lives to you. These are the simple ingredients in this marvel of a book.Kind of like if Jan Karon set her books in America's heartland, A Can of Peas has that same gentle yet tough-minded sensibility. Filled with memorable characters, heartwarming stories, and unforgetable snapshots of rural Minnesota, A Can of Peas is almost perfect. I can't wait for this author's next one!"
4,Not only for the gals,"I'm a guy, and I don't usually pick up this kind of book, but a friend of mine recommended it and I have to say I was really quite impressed. Some of the characters and their situations really got to me.I usually read action thrillers, so this was really a change of pace. It was a little slow in the beginning, but once I got into it, I was hooked. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I'm not that familiar with this type of book, so I didn't want to overdo it, but it really had a lot going for it."
2,3 piece Halloween tombstone,"The idea of a 3 piece Halloween tombstone at this height seemed like a good one as it would be easy to store. However, it didn't turn out as well as expected. The three pieces do not mate up well. At least with the one I got, it mated so poorly that you could see the posts meant to hold the pieces together. The posts don't really hold the pieces securely either. I think the top piece would have come off in a wind. I suppose you could try to trim the styrofoam so the pieces would fit better but I used minimal expanding foam insulation. It filled the void space between the pieces, hid the posts and glued the three pieces together making the whole thing more stable. Then trimmed and painted to match the rest of the tombstone. It's good now but for the price I paid it shouldn't need all the extra work to make it usable. I'll be sticking with one piece tombstones from now on."
2,"good amplification, very bad sound","this phone is sold by amazon from 3 different sellers, and is the same phone at 3 different prices. all are bad buys because the sound though loud is so fuzzy that it is difficult to understand the caller. do not waste money on this phone. look for an old AT&T 2500 desk set with a G6 amplifying hand set attached. western electric phones always worked and never broke.all the electronic phones today can only be called second best and none of them approach the quality of the older and now not made western electric telephones."
5,Delightfful,"This is a delightful recording that captures the magic of Die Zauberfloete like no other. All of the performances are strong, but Rita Streich's Queen of the Night alone is worth the price of the set. She is simply astounding."
3,Good Quality - NOT REGULATION SIZE,"It's a great ball for the pool. Our old ball lasted for years. I just wish they would post the size of the ball here because it was significantly smaller than our previous Dunn-rite pool basketball. I believe this one is a 24"". Regulation size is 29""."
1,Read it before you buy it,"Relying heavily on the cute cover and editorial review, we bought this book for our preschool children. We hate to belittle the efforts of creative people, especially children's authors. Although See You Soon... has some nice ideas, it does not go anywhere and does not say anything new. Rather than being ""rife with pleasant repetition"", the book is rife with clichés and rip off. As beautifully as the wording of Margaret Wise Brown's classic Goodnight Moon lulls children to sleep, this book under delivers and jars the imagination. Some people may enjoy the blueberry skies and the see ya laters, our family wishes we looked before we pressed `Add to Cart.'"
4,Great Read!!!,After reading the Second Edition I can honestly say that it will prepare you for the ICND test. I think the first edition was written for a different test and even though the information is there you have to really dig to get to it(sorry Mr Odom). It is well illustrated and the IOS screens are very clear and easy to read.
1,No WAY! This is not even close to the CCNA exam,"The CCNA exam has very hard VLSM, EIGRP and OSFP questions, that are not even covered close to the depth needed to pass the ccna exam.not to mention how hard the NAT questions are...This book is hard to read, boring, and error filled."
4,This joke is Hilarious,"Harmony Korine and Gus Van Sant at one time wanted to collaborate on a series of filmed jokes, cannot imagine it would be as funny as what Jim Haggerty has done here.The jokes in this film would be a hit at any cocktail party or truck stop. In fact, my dad was a trucker and I recognized a number of them. Haggerty picked some great ones here.Telling a joke seems to be in the delivery and filming a joke seems to be in the casting. The last here is great. The male actors are oddball doofy sorts, the one exception being the lover who thinks he is a stud (You sure complain a lot for something that only took 30 seconds). The female actors are lovely AND NUDE.This is a movie like Kentucky Fried Movie or Naked Gun where the joke to actual laugh ratio is very high."
4,"Good Multi-Vitamin, Easy to Take","I like these vitamins-- they're chewable and don't taste bad (orange flavor)... I wonder if a previous reviewer doesn't have teeth because I don't find them hard at all- no harder than biting down on an oreo.If you want a calcium/vitamin D supplement you'll have to take something else, as there is not much of either in there."
2,Not a great product.,"I bought this only to make apple sauce. Growing up, my mother had one (for 25+ years) that all of us kids would use and this is nothing like the one we used to use. I have used it 6-8 times and have found the following:- I can only fit a very small bowl underneath it.- The legs slide all over the place easily. I have to grip the handle VERY firmly in order to prevent this from sliding all over the counter top.- The wooden pestle is already all dinged up and even has a chip in it.- The inside of the press is all scraped and dinged upIt does work fine, but the craftsmanship is very low. VERY thin metal, and I don't expect this to last more than 2 seasons of making apple sauce. If I had to do it all over again I would not purchase this item."
1,Incomplete order received,As has happened to many others the shipment I received did not contain the wooden pestle or wire rack which makes the food press useless. Reading through earlier reviews I see that this is a continuing problem with this product. In the future I will pay close attention to what other reviewers write in order to avoid wasting my time.
1,Another order with missing items,"I, too, received my order without the stand and the pestle. This appears to be the third order in less than a week that was shipped this way. I'm beginning to wonder whether any of these were shipped correctly. I just called customer service and was told a replacement would arrive before the 24th. I'm not real confident that I will have it in time to give it as a Christmas gift as I had intended. I have not begun the return process yet, and based on the previous reviews, I'm not looking forward to it either. I would STRONGLY DISCOURAGE anyone from ordering this item from this site."
3,Not as pictured,"It works good but the one I wanted was the one that is pictured, just like my old one. The one that they sent was more flemzy and not half as sturdy. Just like all the new stuff these days. Twice the price and half as good"
2,Isnt comfy and doesn't stick to the wall,"I just got this thing and have only used it twice. First it doesn't stick to the walls, which wouldn't be too bad if I could just remove the suction cups to make it more comfortable. And you can't have hardly any air in it or it is too hard and very uncomfortable to use. I would find a soft foam or other kind of pillow - don't get this one."
3,"You might like it, but I'm going to try another brand","Removable cover can be washed, although you must fold and push the suction cups through fabric holes to get the cover separated. Tiny nozzle is hard to blow up and is not in a convenient location with respect to the cover opening. Stayed firm for a while, then developed a leak. I'll next be trying a foam pillow and be staying away from inflatables."
3,Not Bad!!!!,The pillow is what you make it. It's not really comfy at all. It depends on how much air you put in. I don't like it.
4,Difficult to inflate,"This pillow is exactly the shape and size we needed for our whirlpool tub, but it was very difficult to inflate. On the positive side, it's not that big, so it didn't take long to blow it up, and hopefully this will mean that it will hold the air well."
4,church on sunday morning,Being from the same general area as janice i understand her characters very well.[or think i do] Since there seems to be a never ending supply of these confused folks of which i am one i generally hope for a character recognizable by a pecularity that i may have. Chanell sitting in church on sunday morning with her neighbors and friends speculating about her supposed marriage to an overweight lawyer when she reads the church bulletin. The preacher will be preaching in another church the next sunday so there will be no church that day. Chanell feels relieved that she will not have to be there like hearing that school is out. Having had those rebellious feelings many times myself makes chanell and the companion characters more believable. marshall
3,Paw Paw Patch,"With all the hype for this book, I could hardly wait to start reading. However, after starting to read this book, I was a little disappointed. It seemed to be slow in starting and something was missing in the storyline. I almost didn't finish the book, but after paying $6.99, I made myself suffer through, but with many intervals. At times I could not tell where the time periods were divided from past to future. Also, the ending was a big let down. To me, the ending just seemed to fade away without really finishing the story. Oh, well, I have many, many more books to read, so on to the next one."
3,kinda like The Help on a white trash level,"very mixed feelings about this book.it's kinda like The Help on a white trash level.the characters portrayed in this story are exactly why the world thinks southerners are ignorant, racist, and spiteful fools. in this book, all of them are.i did love the dialog. it's so natural and seems to ring true. it doesn't seem forced or bubba-fied.the characters - even the ones you are supposed to root for and like - like main character Charnell Foster - is so flawed i don't really like her. this town is full of unkind church people, most of who are fat. rumors are the town's (the white people anyway) greatest source of entertainment. the few blacks portrayed are noble.i HATED how the Charnell (the author, actually) used the town's black population to spur plot. Charnell does admit to feeling bad about that. i suppose the author feels bad about that too. big deal."
5,Bob Takes Over a New Generation,"I grew up with Bob Dylan playing on my dad's stereo. I truly love a lot of his ""old"" stuff. However, I only bought a Dylan disk, this one, when I had the opportunity to see him touring with Paul Simon (why buy them when I can borrow them from dad?). While I am not a fan of the first song, the rest of the disk is terrific. Ranging from foot stompin' blues to downright rock to amazingly introspective ballads, this disk has everything that Dylan does best. Now my one and three year olds will be exposed to the same legendary music I was, and a new generation will realize how truly gifted Dylan is."
1,"Not comparable to ""Oh Mercy""","I can't understand how people can compare this to the masterpiece ""Oh Mercy"". Even if Daniel Lanois is the same producer the final result is completely different. I could recommend this only to real country lovers, for other it's just a bore. No track of an inspired Dylan, let's skip back to ""Pat Garret"" or ""Desire"""
3,A marginal Dylan C.D.,"I'm puzzled at the large numbers of wildly enthusiastic reviews for this c.d. Yes it is a dark album, Dylan has never been afraid of adressing loss, betrayal, complex truths. But what is lacking here is beauty. Man in the Long Black Coat from Oh Mercy covers similar territory, yet the images in that song for example paint a much more vivid picture than anything presented here. The whole feel of the c.d. is more like a scribbled drawing rather than a painting. I try to imagine a stranger in a bar singing these songs and I don't think it would be very impressive. This is about as close to despair as I've ever heard him, dosn't sound like a good place to be."
2,"Powerful songs, but too full of deapair","I've been a Dylan fan from the beginning, but maybe this is where we part company; I simply don't like this album. OK, I agree that life makes me sad too, but the bitter deapair that permeates the lyrics and music is just too much to stomach. Keep it to yourself Bob (and Daniel Lanois); who needs it? I'll take the sweet sadness of Emmylou Harris over this stuff any day. What ever happened to the idea that art should transcend the darkness in us?"
2,Is Bob Dylan turning pop?,"This album, considered the bestseller of Bob Dylan's entire career, seems like the undeserved end of the greatest singer-songwriter. ""Trying to get to Heaven"" is only a paraphrasis of ""Knockin' on Heaven's door"" and the other songs look like Elton John, not Bob Dylan, wrote them. I'm extremely sad for this change from folk-rock to Brit Pop that knock down the Legend."
1,"Dylan's worst since ""Blood on the Tracks""","Just kidding: ""Blood on the Tracks"" was okay...a bit embarrassing, mediocre like his ""Planet Waves"" before. ""Time Out of Mind"", on the other hand, is simply awful. Its producer should win a Grammy award for most tasteless and indiscriminate use of echo. The playing is amateurish and sloppy: none of the musicians seems to have a solid grasp of where ""one"" is (or, for that matter, ""two"", ""three"", or ""four""). The songs are utterly vapid, completely devoid of lyrical inspiration and tune (needless to say); their chord progressions are the moldiest, tritest chord progressions you can imagine. I think it significant that no one who praises this album can seem to point specifically to anything in it to bolster their claim of merit. I recommend ""Time Out of Mind"" to all of Douglass Adams's ""electric monks"", those with a desperate desire to believe anything anybody tells them about anything."
1,a jarring return to splendor,"The emperor's new clothes are so subtle they're apt to slip by the eyes of casual viewers. As resplendent as the Emperor's most fashionable garments, these new clothes add to his wardrobe the perspective of impending mortality (a consummation devoutly to be wished). Everything is understated, from his non-existent shoes to his stunning lack of underpants. Don't be fooled by the outfit's ostensible vacuity--these are among the best new clothes in the past twenty years."
2,Disapointing,"This CD is no good. I thought I would like it because I'm really into people like Niel Young, Emmylou Harris and Lucinda Williams. In fact part of the reason I made the mistake to buy this was because Daniel Lanois who produced Emmylou's steller CD ""Wreaking Ball"" also produced this peice of crap."
2,Praised Out of Proportion,"I've been listening to Bob Dylan since 1964. I've been through a lot as a fan, from the brilliant Sixties to the mostly dead Eighties to the stunning release of ""Love and Theft"" last year. Of all the things I've witnessed in his career, the acclaim ""Time Out of Mind"" has gotten is the most puzzling.I don't like this album. I've listened to it many times trying to let it grow on me, but it won't. It's so dreary, monotonous and suffocated that it is a chore to listen to. None of the songs run in my head and compel me to play them again and again as do the masterpieces on ""Love and Theft."" Yet it is praised to the skies.Sorry, I just don't get it. Even Dylan himself has said that he couldn't get what he wanted while making this record. It's pretty obvious he's surprised that people like it; he doesn't.Skip right over this one to ""L&T"" if you're looking for Dylan's real comeback album. Or get the one before it, ""World Gone Wrong,"" another Dylan album with some real heart."
3,This album does not seem worthy of all the critics praise,"Dylan's latest album does have the raw, if somewhat eerie, emotional musical feel to it that is his trademark. I was far more impressed with his earlier work, than with this album. His lyrical abilities seem to have deteriorated steadily since Blood on the Tracks, with the exception of such songs as Blind Willie McTell and Series of Dreams. The lyrics on this album, besides being uncannily depressing, lacked the poeticism that made Dylan a legend to begin with.One thing that I have to give him credit for, is his ability to change with the times. In the same way that albums such as Freewheelin' and The Times They Are A-Changing reflected the anti-war, rebellious sentiments of the sixties, Time Out of Mind reflects the gloom, despair, and negativity that is an overall characteristic of the nineties."
3,Too few good tunes.,"While Dylan is without doubt one of the outstanding songwriters of our times, this CD is overall disappointing: You expect a lot, and what you find is that it's hard to stay attentive all the way. Overall, little is really captivating here: Too many slow songs that tend to sound repetitive, and that goes for the lyrics, too. Only one or two songs really get you."
5,fantastic album,"i see why he won a bunch of grammy's that year,because its his best album since ""blood on the tracks"".The song ""make you feel my love"" is the most gorgeous song he ever sang.You can hear&understand every word he says,and thats the truth.I love it,i love it,i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Simply Amazing!!,"Wow didn't see this coming. After a fairly unproductive period in the early 90s which saw the relaease of Under The Red Sky, Bootleg Series Vols. 1-3, Good As I Been To You, World Gone Wrong, 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration, Greatest Hits Vol 3 and MTV Unplugged - Dylan releases this amazing collection of songs seemingly out of nowhere. Highlands is one of his best songs EVER! His voice is perfect for these songs and every song is amazing - highly recommended - get it now!!"
1,AS IF HIS VOICE ISNT HORRIBLE ENOUGH,"...HE HAS TO SHOW HIS ''THIS IS WHAT DEATH LOOKS LIKE'' FACE ON THE COVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! bob is no musical genius (no ''O'' in genius,people !!!!!!!!) but he is a genius exploiter.he duped a generation of hippies into believing his junk.its been said before,put some other drunk guys name on any of bobs cds and not one person would buy it.except for tom waits but that goes without saying."
5,if delia made you cry..,"maybe this is the saddest record of all times, sadder than billy holidays late recordings of strange fruit or moonlight in vermont, sadder than sometimes it rains in april or Nico's 'the end' or Cales 'heartbreak hotel'. 'in the doorway' hurt me like a blow, 'not dark yet' makes my eyes leak but 'make you feel my love' gets me by the b++++, every hope is in vain and precious at the same time. If you are able to face defeat you will find a warmhearted brother in this Dylan, if you want 'idiot wind'-like bite, your late. This is the Dylan of the tragically underrated 'world gone wrong' and 'good as i have been to you'. If you hated those, don't try this, go back to U2, they are normal again now. If Delia made you cry, you may enter here and find a voice for all the pain you know."
4,Dylan's back!,"Dylan survived his heart fungus, and he's writing and performing with fire once again. Many of the lyrics are depressing, but there's so much life in the performances that the record is uplifting."
4,Time out of Mind review,"As is typical with Dylan,if there is at least one or two really good selections on the album it is worth it.....my two favorites are ""It's not dark yet"" and ""Standing in the Doorway"". J.K."
3,Minding time,"3 1/2Strong comeback which helped Dylan regain some relevance isn't completely unique, as it does rehash a few tired blues themes repeatedly, but with at least half the disc offering positive new compositions guided by absolutely accentuating production, even the extended rambler of Highlands makes sonic sense when through the throaty cynicism of our lead."
5,The Night Is Always Darkest Right Before the Dawn,"Dylan has been written off time and time again by critics and fans alike. But every time, he rises to the challenge to confound his critics and delight his fans. This album is a triumph of the first order.Never has Dylan sounded so world weary, or so wise. The lyrics are so honest, so humble, almost confessional. The music is eerily beautiful, in the best tradition of the blues. And Dylan's delivery proves that the medium is the message. The delicate phrasing and tonal shading only adds to the artistry. No one but Bob can sing with such poignancy and quiet power.Keep on keeping on, Bob!!"
3,Ripper dipper return to form,"Time Out Of Mind is a ripper dipper return to some sort of form from da mang who had set his sails for pissing his reputation away for good, but for me it is a tad too bleak and a little samish all da way through... it be a brilliant album don't get me wrong, n I can see why everyone hails it as a masterpiece n schitt, but I don;t know it's too similar for me all the way through... joo know, slow ballady song followed by dark fast blues song followed by ballady song followed by dark fast blues song followed by ballady song followed by dark fast blues songballady song followed by dark fast blues songballady song followed by dark fast blues songballady song followed by dark fast blues song, etc."
2,Positively 4th Rate,"It takes a fair bit of critical contortionism to declare this any kind of masterwork, especially considering it comes from a man with a few genuine classics under his belt. Despite popular opinion, Dylan's lyrics here are uniformly horrid, travelling the short distance between trite and awkward with less flourish than your garden-variety Hallmark card. Melodically the songs are indistinguishable from one another, with Dylan's cracked honk blending into the thick soup of Daniel Lanois' ponderous soundscape until it sounds like one of Brian Eno's ambient albums as mewled by a goat. I'd actually prefer the goat. Do Dylan a favor and pick up a copy of ""Blonde on Blonde"" or ""The Basement Tapes"" or even ""Love and Theft"" instead of this over-praised steamer."
1,Time Out Of Mind,"This album is a dirge. And a mess. The Academy was out of their minds to award it a Grammy. If you want to hear the power and brilliance of Dylan, PLEASE forego this one and skip to his 60's and 70's work. This is one of the artists poorer efforts, and the fact that it has garnered such accolades is a testament to the pitiable state of current day music. Don't waste your time, there are a hundred great Dylan songs, none of which are here. He has lost it and is over the hill only the reviewers are too dumbed down to notice."
1,I felt ripped-off,"Before you shell out your cash for this book,be forewarned that the ONLY picture that is in color, is the one on the cover!There is not one color photo inside this book,everything is black and white,and most of those are very grainy."
4,crisp and clean...,"...that's the Cleveland way. It's definitely note perfect, but perhaps unfulfilling and uninspiring in some sections of both pieces. The recording quality is superb (as Grammophon usually is), and like I said before, all the notes are there, but it's missing that extra ""umph"" that Stavinsky's music calls for. Also, this is the 1911 version of Petrouchka, NOT the 1947 version as labeled on Amazon.com. Don't be mislead by that."
3,"Excellent Petrushka, but Disappointing Rite","In ""Petrushka"", Boulez and the Cleveland Orchestra sounds excellent. However, the ""Rite of Spring"" by Boulez was pretty disappointing! (He was excellent in the complete version of ""The Firebird"" though.) The performance is indeed good and sharp with the Cleveland Orchestra, but I don't thing it is as excellent and ""thrashy"" as the one by Bernstein and the New York Phil, recorded from Sony Classical. (I reviewed on that one too, so find it if you want to.) I think it is best for you to buy Lenny's instead. His performance will surely rock the musical scale for sure!"
3,Some flaws..,"I always find it amazing that record companies, in this case Teldec, don't take the little extra effort to turn a good product into a great one. In this case their error was to not split The Rite of Spring into 11 tracks for each of the subparts like everyone has done (this recording has only two for each of the two main parts) and include liner notes that explain each of the sections. For collectors that already have other versions this may not be a problem, but for novices that are trying to study the music, the omission is unacceptable. Also, the liner notes stink--2 pages total for the 3 pieces and then 3 pages on Barenboim!"
5,Pretty Amazing,"For those unfamiliar with Barenboim's conducting, he seems to have a reputation for leaving issues like entrances and accuracy of rhythm for the players to deal with. In short, ensemble precision typically is not a trademark of his, which makes the performances on this CD all the more shocking. Who would expect the Rite of Spring, of all things, to sound so rhythmic, clear, and powerful under Barenboim? He has the Chicago Symphony playing with incredible tightness and security in this remarkably difficult work. The various climaxes are full of fire, as well.Both La Mer and Boulez's Notations VII get refined playing also, even though there's a certain heaviness about the La Mer that takes away slightly from some of the atmospheric and shimmering effects of the piece. Overall, a great (and surprising) disc, supported by Teldec's terrific sonics."
1,"""Principles of English Usage""? I think not....","I bought this book from Amazon.com on the advice of a good friend who writes technical support manuals for a software company; I figured it was a sure bet. I wish now that I had read the reviews before I clicked ""Add this to your shopping cart.""What a *perfect* example of style over substance -- and a style attempting to imitate that of _The Chicago Manual of Style_, at that (nice touch with the orange cover, kids...). This is really nothing more than a glorified glossary of terms with kicky packaging and hard-to-read pages. It's a magazine article about Internet/Web jargon on both steroids *and* acid. I expected much more in terms of content and guidance and I was sorely disappointed. I hope Amazon.com's return policy is as straightforward as it seems."
3,Are the WIRED staff as pompous as this book implies?,"""SIGGRAPH"" is ""Siggraph"" because the folks at WIRED find theoffical ACM acronym too something. ditto ""Wais"" and ""Arpanet"".The section titles are effectively useless. Do I look up""VDT"" under ""Transcend the Technical"" or ""Anticipate the Future""?I'm glad my company paid for this book, otherwise I'd wanta refund. I just hope we don't adopt it as a style manual.Wired Style is perfect for people who don't know how towrite about computers and the Internet and don't care ifthey know how to write about computers and the Internet.Get a good glossary of computer terms and a decent stylemanual (AP, UPI, whatever) and you'll be much happier."
2,No wonder they couldn't float an IPO,"A rehash of the obvious. Thoroughly pedantic. Does Wired think it knows something about about the subject. $18 dollars burned. After attempting to swindle ignorant invesotrs with a failed public stock offering, Wired has turned to petty larceny"
2,Portable Kitchen replacement grid and grate,"The grate fits and works nicely. The Hinged Cooking Grid did not fit inside the grill the way it should have, and prevented the lid from closing properly. I had to take a bolt cutter to it to make it fit better. Now it doesn't look like a professionally fitted grate."
5,awesome and inspiring,The only thing to top this CD is the MTV video I watched while in Saudi Arabia on 'The India Hit List'. That was magnificent. AR Rahman is a superbly talented artist.
5,One of the best Indian CDs to come out,"The music on this CD is excellent, and it is the last recording of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan before he passed away. One of the interesting parts is Rahman's ability to intertwine Western and Eastern music for a truly unique sound."
1,Poorly made and way overpriced,"This stuffed animal is very poorly made. It would have to be for display only. It would fall apart if given to a child to play with. Not only is the shipping fee ridiculous, but the monkey is WAY overpriced, too."
1,Did not like,I did not like this spray and gave it to a co-worker. I used it twice and had to stop. It left a gross film on my hair and did not make my hair smooth and silky.
4,"Not so great for straightening but excellent for curling. yes, curling!","My stylist used this in my hair for curling. It holds a lot better than any other styling product for holding onto curls. She spritzed it in my hair, then curled, then finished by spritzing a little bit of hair spray. My hair has NEVER been able to hold curls, but its been 5 hours and they are still holding. Try it!"
2,disappointed,"I read this book many years ago and then again from time to time.this is a very bad translation, and therefore didn't enjoy it quite as much.The result is quite different from Salgari's original"
4,A classic pirate story,"If you want to share a great story with your children, this book is definitely a good choice. Adventures, treasures, friendship, fighting, love are all here floating around the mysterious figure of Sandokan who is a strong pirate but also a passionate man. Welcome to the world of The Tiger of Malaysia !!!"
1,Nice Looking But Built With EXTREMELY CHEAP Components,"Several years ago, my wife bought me two different Lionel train lamps at a local Lowes store (way cheaper than what is listed here). After a short while (less than a year), nothing worked on either lamp ~ neither the light nor the operating train. Made of pure, cheap plastic with parts that probably burn through (I purposely used low wattage lights to make sure the lamps didn't overheat but they still burned out WAY TOO SOON). BUYER BEWARE unless you have the tools and know-how to carefully break open plastic components & rewire/replace with lamp parts that will actually last. This is not a knock against these Amazon sellers; the product itself looks sharp but is poorly contructed due to cheap, electrical parts."
2,Give this one a miss,"Despite the fact that this lamp looks solid and classic (looks like a real wooden base in the photo with a glass shade), it is actually 100% plastic. We have had it for 7 months and I would not buy it again, nor would I recommend it to anyone with children. The lamp makes a low crackling sound for several minutes after we shut it off, like it settling down after getting too hot (though the bulb we use is the wattage specified by the manufacturer). I never feel very safe when this thing is on, and certainly won't ever leave it unattended or on for too long. Cheap plastic construction."
5,Brilliant! One of the top sad love stories I've read.,Discover what many have been missing in one of the top sad love stories I've read. This book took me back to when I was young and had challenges in life. Want a page flipper? Learn why Joe Black is quickly becoming one of the fastest growing authors. I promise when you own this book you will finish it quick. It's Brilliant! One of my favorite sad love stories.
5,a good reality book,easy 2 relate to. lots of the same situaitions happened to me in high school. took me back to my high school days got me thinking alot about how i was back in the day.
4,Just what the Doctor ordered.,"Yes folks, this gasket does fit a Mirro model #0406 16 quart canner/cooker. The gasket fit the lid of my pressure cooker almost perfectly. I say almost because when I first placed it inside the lid there was what seemed to be a definite excess of gasket material that I thought would likely cause problems. However when the cooker built up pressure for testing (15 lbs) it held that pressure for 30 minutes with no leaks as the excess material was forced out around, and against the canner, and lid.I gave it 4 stars because I've no idea how many years, or uses I may, or may not get out of it. However I suspect that it will last as long the canner itself. If so then I perhaps should have given it 5 stars huh. But if not, then what? 3-2-1? Only use, and time will tell."
3,wrong product description,"product description obviously does not match the product. This is a gasket for a pressure cooker, not a pan. Will it fit a vintage Mirro pressure cooker model M0512?"
3,Choosing the right gasket for my pressure canner.,"With the information available on the gaskets it was hard for me to order the right one for my pressure canner. The gasket I ordered did not fit, according to the charts it should have. I later found out that because of the canners age they don't make a gasket for it anymore. It would have been nice if they had a better cross reference chart for pressure canners including ones that are obsolete like mine.They say it is a safety thing."
1,The item is very thin and a broke within days!,"The item arrived on time but is very thin and broke after our daughter wore it just a couple of times. We didn't contact the seller because the piece fell and we didn't have much of the earring to send back. In addition, we waited a few weeks to give it to our daughter so by the time it broke the return period expired. Very bummed about this product."
5,A Requiem for the Loved and Lost,"A requiem is a mass for the dead. Methuselah lived 900 years but did die. Not so Mr. Flint, and old and tired man who cannot die but who has been dead for millenia.This is one of the most powerful displays of television drama I have seen. James Daly, the guest star, creates a compelling character of depth, with pitiable resignation in a man who has known all there is to know--and yet is alone (sounds like V'ger, now that I think of it...).Although there are inconsistencies in the plot, I find them minor compared to Shatner's portrayal of anguish and desperation in the final act, leading to Rayna's death from a broken heart.All who have loved and lost will see themselves in ""Requiem for Methuselah"" and understand it perfectly.Oh yeah--pretend ""The Way to Eden"" isn't here. It would be for the best."
2,What were they thinking?,"""The Way to Eden""...absolutely the WORST ""Star Trek"" episode of all time. Lame script...bad acting, lousy ""flipped"" images.""Requeim for Methuselah"" Not too bad.. Kirk meets Flint...a man over 6,000 yrs. old...who has a female robot. Guess who tries to get the girl from Flint? (Hint: name rhymes with Dirk)"
5,Money Well Spent,"My debts are running my life and I was going to file for bankruptcy until I found this book. You can tell this guy knows what he is talking about. I especially liked the references to real life situations and all the helpful hints he provides. After reading the book, I'm sure I can get creditors to work with me because it's better for them. I also like the idea of doing the dirty work myself rather than using a debt counselor. This way I know my best interests will come first and I don't think I'll ever let myself get into this kind of debt problem again. Now, I'm going to read it again and start doing what has to be done. This is a terrific book. The best $18 I've ever spent."
5,Whittling Twigs & Branches,"For anyone who likes to go for nature walks and collect twigs and branches and do some whittling with them, then this is the book to get.Easy to follow and read, very good."
5,easy to really use lessons,"I have been very pleased. One of the few ""how to"" books to learn a skill that I have come across that can actually do the job straight from the book without already having some skill or personal lessons to go along with it. I have been having fun making animals and leaving them around for my children to find."
3,Basic whittling,"Now I just recently started woodcarving and my wife bought me this book as a gift. I must say it is an interesting book for what it covers. Basically the author shows you how to pick out twigs and branches to make the birds featured in this book. The cuts seem basic and with a glance at them it seems that it would just be a matter of practicing to duplicate his work.If you go camping and want something to do around a camfire, this might be the book for you."
2,I hope you like roosters!,"There's not much in this book besides branch roosters and varieties thereof. There's not a single useful thing to whittle in here. I understand whittling is not always about utility, but this is just pure fluff. It is hard to tell by the sample, too.The best part of the book is the intro, where Lubkemann discusses knife selection.His other book, The Little Book of Whittling, is much better.I may try his other book, the one with 'Big' in the title, as it appears one can at least make old-fashioned country games with directions in that book.Chris: if you read this, please write another book with nothing but *practical* projects. You'll make a million bucks.I wouldn't buy this one again, but it might be good for woman whittlers or even men who are making gifts for women. I'll probably try a branch rooster for my wife, then just put this aside for the next generation. Maybe my newborn daughter will use it in Girl Scouts or something."
2,Not for kids,This was a present for my grandson and most inappropriate. I thought it would show him technique. All it included was patterns to make objects -- something his own imagination ran counter to.
4,Prefect for the beginner woodcarver,This is a helpful booklet for the just getting started woodcarver. There is a lot of helpful information on woodcarving techniques.
5,"Puccini: Turandot (Highlights) / Karajan, Domingo","Puccini: Turandot (Highlights) / Karajan, Domingo is a 1982 Polydor recording under the direction of Herbert Von Karajan and starring Placido Domingo in the role as Il Principe Ignoto. The combination of a great singer and conductor makes for true opera magic. The pace set by Von Karajan is right on the mark. Domingo's performance is splendid. The booklet contains well-written music notes but unfortunately not the lyrics. It does however contain photographs of the performers from the time of the recording. A magnificent recording. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5."
3,Another good book from a phenomenal author,"If you are looking for a sci-fi fantasy author that can tell a story rich with detail, romance, and intrigue look no further than David Gemmell. In Lion of Macedon he weaves a story set in ancient Greece, following the development of a troubled soldier named Parmenion. As in his other works the story is full of twists and turns, prophecies, war, love, loss, and an ending you never see coming. Great for a vacation book that makes time on the plane pass quickly!"
5,New to David Gemmel,"Never read books from this author before but I like this genre so when I saw the book at a friend's, who is actually an english literature teacher, I asked to borrow it and I was hooked. I think it's one of the best books I've read in a very long time and I'm ordering the second one in the series."
5,"Swords, wars and sorcery","This book has great historical and fantasy stories woven together - I really enjoyed Lion of Macedon until the last few chapters. I feel the story then really got caught up in the sorcery aspect and gave less to the historical/fantasy items that I like. I really did like the book and would give it a great review.The sorcery parts were well written, but I would have rather read more about how the armies were trained to fight like legionaries when they were really poor farmers."
4,Historical Fiction,"I had put off reading this along with Dark Prince and the Troy series. Even though I was a huge fan of David Gemmell, I never really liked historical fiction. When I heard of his passing, I was sad that I would have no new fiction of his to read ever again, so I went out and picked up the Troy novels, Dark Prince and this one. I am delighted that this is a classic Gemmell tale with a liberal dash of historical names. Though he is historically accurate as far as the end results, how he arrives is entirely his own doing. The story centers around a half Spartan/half Macedonian named Parmenion who grows to be the greatest general of the known world. The story covers the fall of Sparta as the main power of Greece, as well as the rise of Thebes. It ends with the birth of Alexander the Great. It is a very good story with typical Gemmell battles, grand heroes, and the ever present magic of the source. This story is a winner."
3,GREAT SCARF,This scarf is a great alternative to those thick winter ones. I bought it a fews years back and I want to buy a few more.
4,Dope,"Right after the holy trinity of LOGICAL PROGRESSION, PLATINUM BREAKS & TORQUE, comes V CLASSICS AND this monster. though the vocal bytes found on ""dreams of heaven"" & ""deep inside"" might not be to your liking, other tunes such as ""mute"" & ""gray oddyssy"" manage to ride the fence between light and dark with amazing skill. either way, you MUST hear the absolutly Dope ""locust"" by ed rush & fierce, THE BEST! tech-style tune ever made!"
3,Moody drum & bass compilation,Unique ambient drum & bass containing interesting tracks from optical and grooverider himself. The compilation has a laid back house feel to it.
5,About Time,"Paul Barnett has written a timely book. There has been much written in recent times about how Jesus and history cannot be ever matched. Barnett who is faithful to the Bible and to history has brought the two together. It is a refreshing approach after the various ultra liberal writers publishings, which seem to just rubbish every aspect of faithful Biblical belief.this book is a must for every Biblical and theological scholar, and for the faithful Christian who feels that the ultra liberal writers are under-mining their faith."
4,An authoritative reference on the roots of Christianity,A valuable and comprehensive discussion of who Jesus Christ is -- from both historical and biblical points of view -- by a well-qualified author.The author's insights will help me again and again as I seek to read and understand the New Testament.
5,Beware of Talking Hot Dogs!,"Man, this is one of the best DVDs I've purchased in a long time. Most of the dialogue from ""Narcotics: Pit of Despair"" is just BEGGING to be sampled. And it's got the guy from ""Freaks and Geeks"" in it!!! And where else can you see Sonny Bono (in a gold lame` suit, no less!) telling kids the dangers of marijuana ""in their own language"". This MUST'VE bee some kind of community service he had to do, or something...There is also a rad case study of some girl's acid trip where her hot dog starts screaming when she tries to eat it, so she squishes/""kills"" it. Dunno, that sounds kind of fun to me..."
5,Woo-Hoo ...!,"I worked in Antarctica for seven months, and for some reason we had this dvd in our library at the station. We watched it about once a week. It's a riot. ""Trainables"" is one of the oddest pieces of ""film"" I have ever seen. Why have the huge close-ups of the presenter when he's got a horribly pock-marked face?It's a fun ride. Good to see some early Kevin Teague before Emergency and Road House."
5,a materpiece!!,"this was the first little mermaid story i was aware of. i'm not really a fan of disney because they alter the stories, among other things, and so in retrospect i thank my mother for getting me this book when i was young. The story is beautiful and the pictures are as beautiful as the story. This is my standard for the little mermaid story and to date all other renditions i've read have been sub-par in comparison."
4,Mindset and physioloy of fighting,"I bought this book because many readers said that this is one of the ""originals."" Geoff is a former bouncer who has many insightful thoughts on fighting. The most important concepts in the book are on how to avoid fights. Secondly, the physiology of the ""adrenal dump"" is discussed at length. This was my favorite part, as I have a backround in medicine. The text is easy to read and understand. The fighting section is less useful, as martial arts are very difficult to learn from a book. Overall, I would highly recommend this book."
4,Know you attacker,"The interviews with real life thugs are an invaluable resource for those interested in understanding the mentality of violent offenders. Many of us train martial arts or self defense but are often substantially removed from the lower life forms who lurk in our streets. This book provides useful insight into their world. Geoff Thompson does a commendable job in explaining the offender's side of violent crime and how to best defend ourselves from it, both physically and mentally."
3,"Great sunglasses, average build quality","Pros:- A killer frame shape, one I have yet to find since- Polarizing is top notch- Comfortable nose pads and frames- Tint is just the right level- Nosepads are easy to clean (no clear, gook collecting two sided nose pads)Cons:- Lenses are easy to scratch (plastic)- Nose pads quickly fall out and get lost (luckily they aren't too bad even without nose pads)- Custom nose pads which cannot be replaced- Too curved to replace with prescription lenses"
5,quick and easy,Makes my car stand out a little more and they were easy to snap on and they snap off to clean
5,"Excellent reading, incredible photographs!","I found this book at a friend's house, while visiting the USA from Toronto, Canada. I read it in one evening, and now can't wait to watch the PBS 4-part special based on it. It has made me view the oceans in a whole new light."
4,Great book and great designs,"Just with this book would have explained his designs better, but we figured them out and made the one on the back cover first. Much fun! We are stitching by hand, so I combined with another book for hand stitching tips. So far, so good!! Worth the money."
4,Poulenc: The Carmelites,"Poulenc: The Carmelites is a 2006 Chandos Records recording conducted by Paul Daniel who leads the English National Opera Orchestra. The sound of this opera has a distinct musical feel to it and the singing is opera light. Even so, the subject is not a light affair and deals with deep religious and moral questions. The booklet contains short biographies of the performers along with short biographies. It also contains well-written music notes and all the lyrics. Recommended. 4/5."
3,Definitely Brain Candy.,This is definitely light reading. I think many will enjoy this adventure of Dirk Pitt if you do not analyze it too closely. It tends to have a somewhat perposterous plot in the vein of James Bond novels. But if the reader knows that going into it then this book can be quite enjoyable - Cussler does an excellant job of telling a story.Dirk Pitt is truly a modern day swashbuckler who can do it all from the physical gun and knife play to the deductive powers matching Sherlock Holmes. He comes complete with a trusty sidekick.I found it a good book to read when I wanted to take a break from Novels with intricate plots. You can just plow full steam ahead on this novel.
3,"Standard Cussler, Entertaining but not spectacular","I enjoy reading the Dirk Pitt novels. Like the James Bond books you have to suspend your belief during the course of the book and not wonder how this guy could survive so many near death experiences from book to book. As with his other books this goes quick and provides ample entertainment. If you have read his other books you'll enjoy this one as well. This however doesn't deserve any more than 3 stars because it really is Cussler just getting started. The story isn't as good as his other future books. I think that ""Deep Six"" and ""Raise the Titanic"" were better. No less outlandish, but kept you at the edge of your seat all the more. So don't take this rating as anything bad, but just know it's not his best book and there's more you can expect out of him."
5,An early Dirk Pitt,"As an avid Clive Cussler reader I was not disappointed with this early Dirk Pitt story. I enjoyed reading how he met Summer but am still mystified how he managed to have twins with her when she disappeared before they got together. Still never let details stop a good story.From the start Clive Cussler introduced the mystery when the submarine disappeared in the ""Hawaiian Bermuda Triangle"" and never lost the plot which is a sign of a good writer. I expected this early story to pale in comparison to his current standard but it never did - I was very reluctant to put the book down.I really recommend this book and if you like Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino then this is a great starting point even though Al doesn't feature as much as later books."
5,Awesome Action Book!,"This book is really cool! It's kinda strange, but I finished it in two days because it was so suspenseful and I'm 14! Really cool book, I highly recomnned it!"
5,Dirk Pitt and Pacific Vortex,Reading the books that Clive Cussler writes is my best hobby. I take my book and go to a sea shore then I start to read the adventures of Dirk Pitt. Pacific Vortex is one of my best books that Clive Cussler wrote. Dirk Pitt is a character whois very enjoyful.Dirk Pitt is a god who never dies-Clive Cussler made him so ! Doa Gündodu
4,Great into to the series....,I love the entire Dirk Pitt series and Pacific Vortex was the 8th one I read. They are all good. I can't wait to read the rest....
1,Pacific Vortex,"I am really getting into the Dirk Pitt series, and am very disappointed that the wireless Kindle version of this book is listed here, but not available to download. What is up with that? Teasing us? Very disappointed..."
4,Experience the Dirk Pitt Magic.,"The first Dirk Pitt book. But already the charm is present, already Pitt has those little touches in his character (and jokes with Giordino) that make him the guy we all love. Short but packed with tons of action, straightforward but intriguing, simple but in no way stupid, this book will provide FUN and ENJOYMENT. Besides, since it's Clive's first, it's worth just for collection. Go grab it! Nothing else to say."
3,Prequel to the successful Dirk Pitt series.,"Pacific Vortex made me wonder if this book was written a long time ago, or as a stop gap novel until Cussler could develop another ""feasible"" aquatic adventure.Vortex is definately weaker than some of Cussler's other Dirk Pitt works. But would be useful in filling in the gap between new Pitt novels."
3,Good but not Cussler's best,"Pacific Vortex is good, but not Cussler's best. Not that it matters, but this is the first Dirk Pitt book published. I like how some of the later Pitt books are longer. This book has a great plot and is very exciting. If you are looking for a quick, but exciting read you should certainly buy this book. You should also buy the other Dirk Pitt books."
5,I read his first - last!,"I've now read them all, and I read the first last. Dirk has matured since this adventure. There is a lot more booze drinking and Dirk even reaches for his cigarettes! Perhaps a sign of the times the book was written? However, the excitement and plot development is awesome. It shows, no proves, Cussler had the talent from the beginning."
3,Good but not Cussler's best,"I thought that Pacific Vortex was a good book, but not Cussler's best. Not that it matters, but this is the first Dirk Pitt book. I like how some of the later Pitt books are longer and in more detail, but this is still worth reading. Dirk Pitt is the most exciting character in any story and if you have never read one of his adventures you really need to. The theme of this story is great and I highly suggest this book. Enjoy the book and check out the other Cussler books too."
2,Huh?,"This book kind of ended the series for me. I've loved the Dirk Pitt adventures and read every book up until now. But really . . . . . did Summer have an immaculate conception? I think they kissed one time, were never even together long enough to have sex. Did Pitt donate sperm? This is just too far reaching for me. I think Cussler could have done better and have had Dirk actually hook up with someone for awhile, at least long enough for them to have actual sex and her to get pregnant. Gah!"
3,Worked well...with undesired after-effects,"I had a LARGE amount of baked-on break dust, oxidation and light rust on my aluminum rims and this stuff (with ALOT of elbow grease) took it right off.However it started stripping the clearcoat all over the rim. I'm very inexperienced when it comes to cars and didn't know that I would have to worry about this, but now I do.My wheels are now very clean, but the clearcoat looks clouded/etched and ugly.I'm now looking into how to re-apply the clearcoat that the acid took off."
2,Read the fine print,"I purchased this item to give as a gift since my friend was going on a European cruise. I thought it would be a useful gift. When I received it the yearly calendars in the book were dated 1996, 1997, and 1998. I couldn't give this to my friend...the calendars would have been no use to her and she would have thought why would she give me such an outdated item. When I inquired to the store why they would even sell an item that was so outdated they said I should have read the entire selling page....copyright 1996. I never realized there would be calendars in it from 14 years ago. I was also blindsided by all of the great reviews. How could the other reviewers rave about a book that is so outdated. Make sure the copyright is current before purchasing this item (especially if you are giving it as a gift)."
5,Great Travel Journal,Have used this product before. It has all the space and categories I like in a travel journal.
4,The Price is Right,"Borley Rectory gained a reputation before the Second World War as ""the most haunted house in England,"" thanks in large part to the efforts of controversial ghosthunter Harry Price. Price was considered by some to be a humbug and opportunist. Over the years, Price's notoriety has sullied the Borley investigation. In this fascinating book, however, author Ivan Banks argues that Price did a better ghosthunting job than his critics allowed and that the Rectory was indeed a very spooky place. In perhaps the most intriguing chapter (the one on Katie Boreham), Banks looks into the allegation that the Reverend Bull helped conceal an illegitimate birth at the rectory, adding to the foreboding atmosphere of the unlovely Victorian house. This theory may be a bit of a reach, but it's a wonderful take on the evidence. Great illustrations and photos."
4,Quality Book,"I'm happy with the quality I received in this book. I was expecting one of the smaller type prints, but I was glad with the size and information that this book offered me. It is a good conflicting alternative to the other books we were required to read for school, and this is just the type of thing we need to get that exact objective education. Good quality for an older text book."
4,exhaustively comprehensive,"i bought this book on the advice of vincent o'neil. it is wildly thorough. fabulous photographs, too, but a bit hard to follow for the american reader. i understand ""odour"" + ""petrol"", but ""spammers""? like i said, it's exhaustively comprehensive. i was thrilled to find a new book on this most fascinating subject, but by the seance section it had become something of a chore. still, an a+ for effort."
1,Won't read this author again,"I picked up the taped version of the book to listen to on the way to work and back. I find the plot silly, and the characters too cardboard. I am offended by the language around adoption, which hasn't been used in over 20 years (""gave the baby away""). I also find the writing cliched and uninteresting. There is nothing new fresh and here. Don't bother."
5,The Pain of Adoption is Obvious In This Story,"With carson Springs still reeling from Samantha Kiley's romance with a younger man, her best friend, Gerry Fitzgerald, fires up the town with another sensational scandal. The child Gerry put up for adoption twenty-eight years ago-and kept a painful secret from her family, has come back into her life. But not without a lot of bitterness attached.Claire Brewster is a successful attorney engaged to her childhood sweetheart. She hurt her parents feelings when she chose to find her biological mother and family, most of whom do not welcome Claire into their fold.A bittersweet tale, and I enjoyed this book. As you read, you could feel the pain of rejection and all the hurt it brings to a child who is rejected by their natural family."
2,Disappointing,"I listened to this unabridged book on tape in the car. I had never read or heard this author before, and I'm not sure if it was partly the reader's voice (blah) but the characters seemed one-dimensional to me. There was a lot of action, but not much insight as to what the characters were thinking or why they did what they did, or frankly, why I should care. Some graphically described sex scenes thrown in (not well-written or interesting either) which juxtaposed with the rest of the book and its theme. None of the characters were really likable or interesting, in my opinion, either. Just when I was starting to get into a character, two more were added, until there were too many to keep track of or want to. Perhaps it would have been better experienced reading and not on tape. I hope so!"
1,False advertising!,"First of all the product they sent me in the mail looks totally different from the preview picture. They sent an orange bottle of ""maca"". I tried it out and it had almost NO effect on me. Then I investigated further. On the bottle it says ""maca"", but on the back of the bottle is lists the species name as ""Lepidium spp."" NOT ""Lepidium meyenii"", which is the species name for the aphrodisiac known as maca. I looked it up and Lepidium spp. is peppergrass or pepperweed - a form of tumbleweed!! They're selling tumbleweed! Completely false and misleading advertising! Waste of money!"
5,"""Say Goodbye""","Hello everyone... my name is Lauren Kinkade, and I was the singer you heard on the end credit song ""Say Goodbye"". Thank you all for your kind words!! ""Say Goodbye"" is a great song, and hopefully someday, it will be released. But as of right now, the only place you will find it is on the DVD or VHS.Thanks again everyone!"
4,"Nice acting, great song","Don't expect a lot from this DVD, it offers just two buttons for you to touch: ""View trailer"" and ""Play movie"". No scene access, no special features. Yea, that's sad. But the film itself makes up to what's missing on the DVD. Melanie Griffith gives a superb performance as a schizophrenic ex-girlfriend and distressed mother. You'll love the nostalgic scene of her and Patrick Swayze, from different corners of the world, watching ""The Hustler"" on TV and getting lost in their memories. And the fabulous musical score is definitely some ""bonus material"" to this romantic drama -- especially the last song (""Say Goodbye"", written by Serge Colbert, Mark Portman & Alan Rich and performed by Lauren Kinkade). That melody, along with Griffith's childlike smile, will surely capture your heart."
4,Along for the ride,"This wasnt the best acted movie of all time..but sometimes that isnt what Im looking for in a movie anyway...there are times when I want to watch a movie because it somewhat parallels my own life...such is the case with this movie..knowing you love someone and that he loves you..but, for reasons you cant control...its a love that wont ever be.....I liked Melanie Griffith's character and the way she played her...and Swayze is never hard on the eyes...it helped, too, that he drove a Mustang like mine in the movie...My one big disappointment is that I cant find, anywhere,a soundtrack or even the ending song to buy, download or just listen to...if anyone out there has any info on securing the music...Id love to know."
4,"Worth the time, especially for Griffith and Gordon-Levitt","Where this film isn't a masterpiece by any means, it is certainly worth the time. Melanie Griffith shines in her role as Lulu and Joseph Gordon-Levitt stands out yet again in the role of Martin. Unfortunately, his time is much too brief in the film, as I think he's probably the most underrated actor today. He's extremely believable in his role and he showed us exactly how one would act in the situation his character was in.Give the film a shot, it's worth the time- forget some of the characters Swayze has played in the past and look at him for the character he's playing now. Watch Melanie become Lulu... And lastly, you'll believe Gordon-Levitt is Martin in the awkward situation he's been thrown into.Acting is an A, film is a B."
2,A little to forced and fast paced for my taste,"The movie seemed to move to quickly without having a chance to really know the characters. Big parts of information were left out until the end and it was hard to feel the emotion needed to really get in touch with the film. The acting seemed too artificial probably because the characters had not really gotten to play opposite one another very often except for Melanie's and Patrick's characters. It just didn't allow your feelings to build and grow. It just went from one conflict to another, until it just seemed to far-fetched. I really do like all the actors, Melanie Griffith, Patrick Swayze, even the young boy who played their son, loved him in Sweet Jane! Anyways, they just couldn't get this picture to be more than 2 stas for me, I wish it could have been more, since they had such talented actors!Lisa Nary"
3,lauren kinkade (song is a ten),Lauren your version of this song is truely awesome. Why oh why is this not released. This is a true number one smash. absolute no brainer!!!!Someone is asleep at the wheel. I have been searching the net for this for weeks. Brooke Allsion did a good job but yours was more than memorable. My daughter is learning the song. We have been looking for the music or karoke version...obviously to no avail/ps. tried your link but did not get anywhere
4,OMIGOD!!!!!!,"First of all, read Mr. Janson's review, since everything he said is right on the mark!! I can honestly say that this is the coolest pin-up book I own. Cartegena is a classic Vargas sorta airbrush artist who creates very clean, colorful and bouncy vixens, and Sean does small scale color pencil and charcoal drawings of body builder types. I liked Cartegena's best, since his are more sensual while Sean's are alot rougher and more explicit renderings of women (the women actually have goosebumbs on their nipples!!). definetely a good buy if you like pin-ups."
1,Utilitarian Nonsense,"This is one of the worst libertarian books out there. David Friedman is one of those thinkers that makes libertarianism look bad. In this work, he presents the basic economic arguments against government intervention. To say the least, his exposition left me *underwhelmed.* In addition to this, he makes many poor arguments for anarcho-capitalism, falling far short of other more consistent, and not to mention intelligent anarchists such as Murray Rothbard or even the Tannehills. Furthermore, he makes an almost humorous attack on natural rights theory, ultimately falling flat on his face in the end. Lastly, he turns what could have been the only truly interesting part of his work, the section on ancient Iceland, into a horribly absurd joke by making assertions concerning the importance and quality of Icelandic literature. In the end, this is a genuinely bad book, and I would not waste my time with it."
5,Bought it for all the men in my life!,"Finally, sage words on the delicate art of gift giving. A droll take on what can result in a relationship chasm. We know most men give a gift hoping to see their lover's eyes sparkle; but when the gift misses the mark, it hurts both recipient and giver! And you know how we women can over-think the intention.... ""Did he just misread me, or does he not care?"" Ms. Adam's insightful book makes it effortless for any man, regardless of age, experience or financial wherewithal, to become the dream guy we brag about to our friends. You know the one we mean? The guy who shows how much he cares with that much appreciated (and oft rewarded) thoughtfulness!"
5,Interesting and informative,"This book is for a class but it's still fun and interesting to read because it has tons of diagrams, tables, and pictures to help you along the way."
1,One of the best's in the field!?!? False. One of the worst textbooks I've read in recent times.,"I read this book almost cover to cover. Considering actual literature produced in the field, this text felt scatterbrained, explaining models horribly, only giving the residual surface of theory. It's more like a slideshow of Cognitive Psychology than an adequate introduction to the material. Solso's writing is incredibly dry only caressing the reader's mind with the basics. While the point's themselves may be interesting, the word choice lulled me to sleep on several occasions. Also, much to my annoyance, neural networks are not as prominently mentioned as they are in the field."
3,If you're buying this it's probably because you have to.,I bought this for a class with a title matching the book. It's fine. It's a pretty balanced writing and there are little splashes of humor to counteract the dryness of the topic. I think my personal review may be unfair because I don't like CP.
1,Would give it a -5 if I could,"This text book is full of grammar errors making it a distraction to read. The vocabulary words are sometimes in the glossary and sometimes not. Examples: ""These regions include the hippocampus and the adjacent cortex and thalmus, as indicated in the study of clinical patients who suffer damage in these areas"" Aside from ""and ... and ..."" the wording implies that 'adjacent cortex' is an actual brain part. It should read ""...the hippocamus, thalmus and adjacent cortices."" I'm not going to try to explain the problem with the rest of the sentence.In the glossary, definitions are cut off mid way, missing words and end with a sentence as if it is supposed to end like that.Worst text book I have ever read in my education."
1,nice chain for the price....if it worked,When i got the chain it looked nice seemed a good buy for the price. and then after installing it and trying to adjust my new rear derailleur the chain kept skipping ....i thought it may have been the wrong size (i have a 12 speed) but come to find out it's not one but 2 barrings in the chain that are seized! i ended up swapping out a couple of links from my broken chain. will not buy again and recommend that you do not either.
3,Why pay more for the box?,"This is a wonderful opera and a pretty good execution, but why pay 50% more for this edition? It was made from the same recording session as the 2005 reedition, ASIN B00099BPNI, and I cannot hear the slightest difference. As far as I can see, one is paying only for a fancier box."
1,King solomons mines 1937,I don't think the Allan Quartermain in this movie is the real one. It must be his evil twin Alex Quartermain. He even has black makeup under his eyes just like Spencer Tracy when he played Mr. Hyde
3,Shame on Placido,"Domingo's foray into the baritone world should never have been, at least not here. He is not even close to pulling this off successfully. It is sad. Someone should have stopped him. Otherwise I rather like the set. Battle is not ideal as Rosina, but her vocal fireworks are worth hearing. Her voice in my view is a little too lightweight for the role, but she does some lovely stuff. Lopardo is outstanding. Probably the best Rossini tenor out there except Rockwell Blake. If you want a truly great Barber try the Callas set on EMI or Jennifer Larmore with Lopez-Cobos conducting on Teldec."
2,I feel cheated,"Most of the cast is good, the conducting is good, but Placido Domingo should never have been cast as Figaro. He really seems to be struggling through ""Largo al Factotum"" at the beginning. I might not be so irritated if it were only a [money amount]recording, but for the extra [money amount] I expect a bit more."
1,intox,"don't listen to the others reviewers ! LOPARDO is absolutely awful, what a pity ROCKWELL BLAKE never recorded this role in studio. I prefer not to talk about Miss BATTLE....."
5,"The best ""Barber"" 'cause it's the most FUN!","Rossini's ""Barber of Seville"" calls for two essential qualities: secure florid singing and comedy. A lot of recordings out there provide the former, but not the latter. This one provides both. Raimondi, Gallo and Lopardo play their parts to the hilt, Kathy Battle sings gloriously (though not coyly) and Domingo actually sounds better as a baritone than he sometimes does as a tenor. Abbado's conducting is breathtaking, pulling everything together even as he pulls out all the stops. (You may even find yourself jumping in surprise at the tympani outburst during ""La calunnia""!) The ensemble ending of Act 1 is simply breathtaking. The last complete ""Barber"" that had this much sheer joy in it was the 1929 recording by Capsir, Borgioli, Stracciari, Baccaloni and Molajoli, and that one was incomplete (even to the point of containing an aria by another composer in place of ""Un dottor della mia sorte""), so...this one's the best of all."
2,Domingo's Barber,"Despite its excellent sound and the enthusiastic, well-paced playing of the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, this is a dissapointing release. Lopardo very much excepted, the singers cannot cope with the considerable demands of authentic belcanto style and deliver Rossini's showy, florid tunes in a bald, literal way (Battle and Domingo are the major offenders). Although the recitatives are slightly pruned, the text is almost complete and even includes and extra aria for Rosina (borrowed from Semiramide). Recommended for those who like Rossini to sound like Donizetti or Verdi. Others beware."
3,"OK, not super clear but good value.","This globe is fine, but it's a bit small for my needs. I bought it to supplement a floor puzzle w/ the US map. My 4.5yr. old was interested in maps, so I wanted something durable & inexpensive that would give him the concept of the Earth. Everything is there, it's just so crunched together that there are piles of city names and no visual reference for a small child. It seems to be durable enough--about like a typical nice beach ball. I should have gotten something a bit larger."
2,"We are not lucky and got a deficient one, leak somewhere, and lose most air pretty soon.","We got a deficient one, leak somewhere, and lose most air pretty soon at the first use. The color is good, and the print is better than our previous one. But the quick air-losing pretty it a useless toy."
2,Easily Goes Flat,"The product, though a nice inflatable globe, went flat within a week. The ""patch kit"" only works in a hole that appears on a smooth service. The creases in the globe (the likely place for a leak) cannot be repaired."
3,A lot of talk not enough demonstrative video,2 of these DVDs are an absolute waste the 3rd is the only one that teaches you anything. I have seen others and think most people would prefer something more concise. There is no value in the first 2 DVDs at all don't be fooled. Look for other suggestions online.
1,Zero Rating/Had to put something in,Intro to porn. Didn't find much sacredness in this set. Grossly modified ancient teachings of the kama sutra.
5,Excellent book on a fascinating subject,"This is a great book, built on common sense and fact. Drews is extremely convincing in bringing forward his new theory. No disasters needed, no big conspiracies, nor huge migrations of nations - only simple fact finding leads to a theory that is both fundamental and cogent."
5,Brilliant,"A wonderful dose of common sense. As you watch Drews tear down all the old theories about the end of the Bronze Age, you will wonder, ""How could anyone have really thought that?"". Are the migrations of the ""Sea Peoples"" one of the biggest red herrings in the study of the Aegean and Near East? Perhaps so. Revolutionary, insightful, and a pleasure to read."
3,Very dry and narrow,"I had a very hard time getting into Robert Drews' ""The End of the Bronze Age."" The author's thesis is that changes in warfare resulted in the prolonged ""Dark Ages"" from roughly 1200 BC to 750 BC in the Near East and the Eastern Mediterranean, though he also goes into several other possibilities. I guess I was hoping for a book that explained the Dark Ages, what existed just prior, the extent of it, and a better understanding for it in general. Instead this is a very narrow book, solely aimed at trying to come up with a reason, to the exclusion of the larger significance of it. If you're writing a PhD thesis on this topic this book may be for you, otherwise you may have a hard time staying interested."
3,Catastrophe without Catastrophism?,"Drews has written a book surveying the conventional views, both contemporary and those which have endured. The author discusses various possible explanations for the seeming universal destruction of civilizations throughout the region. It's worth reading, but suffers from reliance on the mistaken consensus chronology of the ancient Near East.While this is a mostly academic work, most adults won't have any trouble with it.Those interested in the Bible and its synchronisms with other ancient peoples would do better to read one of the works listed below, but will find things of interest in this book.See also Immanuel Velikovsky's (new and used) ""Ages In Chaos"", ""Ramses II and His Time"", ""Peoples of the Sea"", and ""Worlds In Collision"", as well as David Rohl's ""Pharaohs and Kings"", Peter James' ""Centuries of Darkness"", Ryan and Pitman's ""Noah's Flood"", Mary Settegast's ""Plato Prehistorian"", and Robert Schoch's ""Voices of the Rocks""."
3,Good Attempt,"I enjoy the featured speakers on this video so much that I was happy to get thier insights. But, this video was not nearly as good as the Quest video - ""Human Potential""There a snippits of great words of wisdom contained in the presentation - but it falls short of providing a cohesive solution and answers to walking a spiritul path to success.Ultimately, if you love these speakers as much as I you will enjoy the stories and knowledge they impart - but, the total package falls short of the title."
5,C'est disk est chic,"I have no clue what their saying in half the songs because right now I'm only in french 2, but the music's real catchy. Even thought I dont under stand half of it, I still like to listen to it because it gets me grooven.C'est disk est tré bien, et j'adore il."
1,These kind of books should come with a warning,Very mediocre story but what can you expect.....it was free!!!However to my annoyance it turned out that it was god squad religious.How I dislike being preached to.
4,Excellent reading!,Blackstock makes this a suspense filled book! Fans of Christian Mystery won't be able to put this book away!
2,mediocre,"I grabbed this book because it was free for Kindle. It was a page turner, but very mediocre. The characters were poorly developed, and as others have pointed out, the crime investigation was handled badly enough as to be distractingly un-believable. I also didn't realize that this was a ""Christian fiction"" when I started it. It ended up being very preachy in what felt like an over-the-top way. I'd suggest skipping this one, unless you're really looking for a Christian crime thriller where the story can take a back seat to the preaching."
1,Doesn't work at all,"When I started this book, I realized it was from a Christian publisher, and thus probably had a religious element to the storyline. Sadly, at first the religious aspect detracted from a very good storyline. As the book goes on, however, the religious perspective gets out of hand.For example, one of the characters is accused of adultery by his wife and thrown out of the house. Despite the fact that he has not committed adultery and has no intention of doing so, despite temptation and opportunity, his wife (and others) believe that he has. Why? Because he thought about it for a minute. His thinking was, 1) it would be nice 2) it would ruin my marriage 3) I love my wife too much to even seriously consider this. To me, that's not adultery.As the book goes on, the religious aspect takes over the majority of the story. A real turnoff for me. And a narrow-minded viewpoint dominates.I pretty much gave up on the book as the storyline fell apart after awhile as well."
4,pretty good book,I could have done without the religious tones through-out but the storyline was good and I didn't figure out who the killer was so that's always a plus to keep me guessing.
2,Kleenex anyone?,"The book was easy reading, with a decent plot and a moderate religious undertone I could appreciate but PLEASE stop with all the character crying. Nobody cries that much in life. Husbands, wives, firefighters, friends, cops and clergy. All your characters were bawling at a drop of a hat. It totally got out of hand and put a damper on the story for me."
2,Too many characters,"Wow, I can't believe how poorly this book is written. I've read other books by Terri Blackstock that were very good. This was NOT one of them. 34 characters in the first few chapters of the book?!! too many to keep up with. They are also vague characters - someones brother, night duty cop, etc, who you barely hear about in the rest of the book."
2,duped by all the stars...am I missing something?,"I didn't read the synopsis first as the title interested me enough, plus it was free, so I can't complain.At first I didn't realize it was a Christian novel, but once I started I committed to finishing even if it was torture part of the way.Halfway through I was wondering how the title even fit into this novel as I couldn't make any connection until almost the very end.Too much marriage drama, and not enough real character and plot development in my opinion.Not understanding why all the high ratings...it was o.k."
2,Room for improvement,"The plot was appealing, but unfortunately, there were artistical flaws in the writing. The dialogue was awkward and many times unnecessary for moving the plot along. It was rife with religious references that at times seemed to be the author's only motivation for writing the book. Although Allie and Mark are main characters, they remain flat and underdeveloped as characters. I found Allie to be prudish and annoying. If you are willing to suffer through slow moving chapters to find out ""who dunnot,"" you might get to the end."
1,"This was free, you get what you pay for.","Most of the main characters were either underdeveloped or unlikeable, especially the ""holier than thou"" wife. The author must have done very little research if this is the way she thinks police and fire departments work."
2,Free & worth the price,"you get what you pay for in this case(it was free). In 40+ years of avid reading, I have only not finished 3 books. This will be the 4th. Stilted, inaccurate (re Mardi Gras in New Orleans, police procedure, fire procedure; geez, most everything, including how my fellow Christians respond to things.)Just not worth the time investment to finish."
5,Private Justice,"Private Justice was a very suspenseful book and I could not put it down. It took me about a week to read and the reading level was fairly easy. I had to start the next book in the series, Shadow of Doubt, the next day because I really wanted to know what happened next. There was never a dull moment in this book. New evidence kept appearing to point to who the killer was and what his/her possible motive could be. It was almost impossible to predict what was to happen next, and I really enjoyed that aspect of it. I highly recommend the Newpointe 911 series to everyone!"
3,Average Mystery Novel,"While I enjoyed the Christian aspect in this novel, I just didn't take a deep interest in it. It seemed to slow moving with lots of monologue and predictable as well. It is an easy read, though, if you want to take a break and forget about your normal life!!"
3,Great potential but needs a good editor,"I just read this on my kindle. As a Christian I wasn't put off by the ""warnings"" that some Christian lit gets. However, I was put off by the sections that were just plain preachy, and not woven into the story well. I believe that God belongs in every portion of our lives, but this author is clumsy in her integration. The marital issues don't provide any clarity as both Allie and Mark are missing the point. The book doesn't utilize the potential to illustrate how a troubled marriage could be strengthened without a life threatening incident.The voice of Nick could have been so useful but his lack of confidence overshadows the good he could do.I like the plot. I came to like a number of the characters. I just wanted to take a red pencil to the whole thing and tighten it up."
2,Got suckered again,Once again I downloaded a free book only to discover it is a Christian book after I got into the story. I wanted to see who the killer was so I finished it but the religious part of it was so unnecessary. And the author's Afterword was revolting.
5,A Christian Page Turner,"This book was excellent. It is very difficult for me to find authors that keep my attention during the whole book. To hear about Terri Blackstock and find out that she not only keeps your attention but gives her books a christian atmosphere was exciting. I started the Newpointe 911 series and have not been able to put them down. The day I get finished with a book, I have to get the next one. Private Justice was very good, and I was lead to believe a certain character was the killer throughout the book and found out that I was wrong. She throws many twists into this book, and keeps you on your toes. I do not believe I ever put this book down if it wasn't for having to do something else. I recommend this book to anyone (young adult - adult)."
2,"If you didn't like the movie, don't buy the CD","If you were spooked out by this creepy movie, I wouldn't recommend the CD. There are only a couple good songs on the soundtrack; the rest just poke along and remind me too much of the miserable scenes of the movie- especially the original score by Ennio Morricone."
3,Ok but needs more features,"Not bad training tool to build radio comm skills with flying. Wish it had more interactive scenarios where you really chat with live controllers and have real feedback insteadof canned responses which made this kinda lame. For the price, it should work like a real sim application."
5,Difficult to find,"This product took a while to come in the FedEx delivery, but was as expected and in good condition. The only issue I had was that this was too small for my aquarium glass thickness. My mistake, but maybe include measurement instructions on the website for getting the correct thickness."
3,Alright,"This book has some interesting anecdotes, but it can be hard to follow. The topic is VERY introductory."
4,Best Hairspray!,Just one spray and hair is in place! Non-sticky with faint fragrance. Holds hair with flexibility to comb through with fingers.
3,It's ok,"I've heard a lot about Fekkai products and how good they are, but they are expensive. So I tried this small size first to see if I liked it. I don't see what the fuss is about. It's just ordinary hair spray and I don't see anything great about it. Glad I tried the small size before I spent twenty some dollars for a big can."
1,Knockout hair or knock out lungs,You better think twice about buying this hairspary. The smell is so strong it will knock you out.Save your lungs and your money its not worth the price your health is more important than your hair.I'm returning this hairspary back to Walgreens.
4,"Keywords: ""Sheer Hold""","This is a light-hold hair spray that finely mists. For my fine Asian hair it holds the style for a few hours, but did not last all day. After spraying for a few seconds all over, it gives my hair a slightly coarse texture. This product would be ideal as a finishing hold spray post-styling, keeping that look for the next few hours. Does not flake when combed out."
2,Bargus,"I purchased this after having no luck with the sprays sold in salons which seemed to ""build up"" quickly and dry my hair out. I have very fine, straight hair and needed a product that would hold the style without damaging my hair. I had gotten a sample of their glossing gel and loved it so I decided to splurge on the hairspray.PROS: smells nice, does not ""build up""CONS: the price!!! NOT worth it!!! Does not hold my hair style more than a few minutes and I was constantly using more and more hoping it would!!! I have found three other brands that are half the price, do not contribute to a build-up and actually hold my hair.It's probably ok for someone with thicker hair who feels it is ok to spend this much on a hair spray only."
3,"Huge toy, good value, breaks/comes apart easily.","I was extremely excited when I found this toy at Toys'R'Us before Christmas. It was quite cheap for the size and coolness factor of the ship. My 8 year old son loved it for about a week and then became frustrated at how difficult it was to keep it put together. The ship is packed with movable/removable parts and You simply can not move it, or even scoot it very far on the floor without a mast falling over."
4,pirate ship,"the seller had this toy to me in less than 4 days wow thank you, and my son loves it thats all he can talk about and play with at this time. I would order again from them."
2,Breaks apart easily,"My 4 1/2 year old son got this for Christmas. It was easy to put together but it falls apart very easily. All he has to do is tip it over and a whole side breaks off and masts come tumbling down. I give it points for looking cool and simply because he loves pirate ships, but I am dissapointed overall at the quality. We've had much better luck with Legos."
4,Definitely one of the best books ever,I am currently reading this book and I love it. It has everything a good fantasy needs. I recomend this book to anyone who likes a good fantasy story.
5,Wow!,"This book is amazing. I began reading it at about ten pm, after it had sat in my room for nearly a month, and discovered I could not put it down! I read until 1am and then finally decided that if I didn't go to bed I would pass out. As soon as I woke up the nedxt morning I resumed reading. I was enchanted by the amazingly realistic characters and was drawn into the senery. I feel that any fantasy lover would enjoy this book."
5,Fascinating! I've never read anything quite like it!,"I consider myself to be a feminist, and I love the charactors. Isabeau is a kindhearted dreamer with a strong spirit...almost the exact opposite of her twin sister, Iseult. Scruffy, the boy thief, and his newfound friend, Tomas, the healing boy, were adorable. I could not put the dang book down! Whoever said they almost screamed when they saw the back page, well I DID scream! I didn't even realize it was over. I finished a page, turned it, and- COMING SOON IN JUNE 1999! My best friend and her mother looked at me and laughed when I told them what was wrong. Although the plot was complicated, I had no trouble figuring out what was going on. I enjoyed the language as well. I had to translate for my friend when she read it. This is definitely one of the best books I have ever read and I can't wait for the sequel!Jessica Richards, 12"
1,Painful,"I found this book to be painful to read, it was slow and the characters were annoying. I think that it had great potential but I found that the characters and the traveling in the book just killed it for me. It was slow and so boring that I could not even finish the novel."
5,I had to come write this review as soon as I finished it!,"A rich, imaginative backdrop for a new series, and Kate Forsyth is a first time author! I've never written a review for a book before, but knew that I had to turn some other readers on to this book. This has all of the makings of a long running series in the style of David Eddings, but it gets you hooked even faster. I'll be anxiously awaiting the sequel."
4,Really good,"I think this was a really awesome book, even if the dialect is odd. But you get used to it after a few pages of it.....only to have ""ken"" thrown at you. It means know, but thats hard to figure out for a while. ANyway, i liked this book because the plot is good, and the characters are well developed. I think that the rest of the trilogy will be really good.....i got pool of two moons last night and its good so far."
5,Great Start,"I've read the first three books to this series and I must say that they are spectacular. This book is a great introduction to the series. You meet all of the main characters in the series in this book and all the past events of their world, Eileanan, are descriped in full. If your a fan of heroic fantasy don't wait another day to get this book."
5,Amazing! Very Pagan-Friendly!,"I seriously would give this book 55 stars if I could. It's especially awesome for Pagans, who will recognize the Pagan references and events with a smile. The plot was interesting, and the characters were very 3-dimentional: Maya wasn't a TOTALLY COMPLETELY evil sorceress, and the Fairgean weren't ALL bad. It really was a lot of fun. Read them all!"
4,worth the read,"In one of the reviews someone mentioned that this book doesnt leave you hanging till you read the next book in the series - that is because not that much has happened yet - it seems to serve mostly as an introduction to characers and setting up the plot. THE book finishes without bringing all the seperate threads together for the long awaited and hoped for climax. Nonetheless it is well written and Forsyth has an excellent sense of storytelling in each of the ministories which comprise the book. It has spirited characters you really feel for, and a touch of romantic tension. I wasnt ever dissapointed with the direction the story took. I am off to find book 2. :)"
2,"Mildly interesting, somewhat amateurish though","I found this book to be mildly interesting; it held my attention more or less long enough for me to finish it. The detailed description of witchcraft was good, I thought, and there were some interesting touches like the skeelie woman who held Isabeau captive in her hut, but honestly, I've seen Celtic mythology done so many times before it's just not that new anymore. I did feel a certain lack of depth to the characters, and there were some amateurish touches--for example, the entire book being written in dialect was, I think, the mark of a new author and I felt the torture scene was somewhat unskillfully handled. It's good enough light fiction; if I want something more serious, I'll read Stephen R. Donaldson or Michelle West's Sun Sword books (Broken Crown, etc.)"
4,"One of more interesting fantasy ""worlds"" developed recently!","Mesmerds, cluricauns, nyxes, fairgean...the list of magical creatures inhabiting Eileanan seems to never end. Each species has unique magical abilities and unusual physical characteristics. This book is well written, fast paced and full of fascinating characters. The only bad thing I can say about it is that the sequel isn't due to come out until June, 1999! Kate Forsyth is a great new addition to fantasy writing and I hope this is only the beginning of a long, prolific career."
4,A fun read...,"Fans of female protaganist fantasy should enjoy this book. Although it uses tried and true fantasy techniques, the writing is engaging and the characters well-fleshed out."
2,I lost interest after about two days...,"I borrowed this book from a friend, who had nothing but good things to say about it... I had only time to read it in the evenings, after work and before I had to go to bed... and it just didn't hold my interest. Plus, I didn't care for the decidedly pagan atmosphere of the world the book was set in... but that's my problem, not the author's. That's all I can really say about it."
2,simplistic and preachy,"While the characters aren't completely unlikable, their adventures lack depth. Encounters with villians are short and end too easily. To add to this, the book reads like a morality play Wiccan style."
1,One of the worst books I have read recently,"The author does not seem to be able to develop character or plot in a way that engages one's interest. The book is poorly written and to be frank, I would not buy it again. I have only given the book one star because if I do not do so the computer will not accept the review. The book does not merit even half a star."
4,Great story,Nicely written story. Although it was originally meant to be a trilogy (up to book 5 currently) it has kept me interested and I'm looking forward to book 5. They are pleasantly paced and good reading.ShatteredCrystalChalice
5,"Great Talent, Little Fanfare",I had never heard of Althea Rene. I was browsing on the suggested listing from Amazon and when I read the byline for Althea it reminded me of Bobbi Humphrey who used to be one of my favorite musicians. I decided to give it a try and I was not disappointed. Her skill and expertise comes through loud and clear in every one of her songs. I am on the lookout for more music by her.
5,One of the best Church leadership books to be written,"I am a former pastor who has been out of ""full time"" pastoring for about 3 years - now I'm a internet consultant. It's been interesting to look at church leadership from the pew again, and to see the weaknesses of our churches and of the leadership in them. This book has put into words what my heart has been from the since God first called me: truly equipping people to achieve their purpose as believers in Christ. It is radical. It is unsettling. But it's words are true, even in the business world, these principles can apply. And when the opportunity opens that I get back into ministry full time, I will begin to apply these principles of leadership."
2,pretty but...,"I love the way these look, however, the are not comfortable at all! These will probably never ""break in"". In the few years that i've had them, I think i've worn them twice for very short periods of time and they hurt my feet due to the material not having any give. If they were made of a softer material, then they would be great. They fit true to size as well."
4,"a mixed bag, mostly great","I bought this CD just for Springsteen's ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"", but I like many of the songs, from a very eclectic group... Willie Nelson can't be beat, a very odd but pleasingly scruffy entry from Elton John... I don't generally like Shawn Colvin but she does credit to ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"". A nice popular mix with nothing too jarring or strange that you have to skip over."
5,Great Christmas CD!,I bought This cd for one song but ended up liking all of the songs. Thank You. The cd is in new condition.
4,Good variety!,"This is a decent collection of artists and songs. Something here for everybody.Track 5 is listed as ""Blue Christmas"" by Willie Nelson when it is actually ""Pretty Paper"" (by Willie Nelson)."
4,The Ultimate Struggle between good and evil!,"This book is essentially the story of the fight between good and evil that rages in a man's soul. Jekyl is too weak to keep his evil side under control and tries to destroy it. The results are horrible. I enjoyed reading this book, but I find it fascinating that you rate this as a children's book. The overall content of the book is certainlly acceptible for a child to read, but to suggest that a child would understand the deep moral undertones of this book is ludicrous."
2,"Excellent material, poor print.",This copy of the Manual of the Christian Knight was compiled of photo copies of the original text written in Old English. It was extremely difficult to read. I had to obtain an E book version to to be able to understand it.
2,Does this book really have a value?,"For [money], I will assume, you wi;; expect more than a book written with font size 12. Very generic context, with a lot of information on how to write your cv, and general carrier guide chapters. I want to be an interim, so I do not need to read thi sstuff. This is not the start of my carrier, so my needs are a bit more advance. But, the book will not offer you the sort of information that you really need. For your [money] you probably get [money] worth of valuable information. I honestly could not recommend this book to anyone ...Hope that this helps,Spiros.MEng, MSc, MMath."
4,A must for educational philosphers,"The book The Meaning of Adult Education by Eduard C. Lindeman is a must-read for an connoisseur of educational philosophy. On each page something can be found that is worthy of being quoted or saved to read another day. For example: ""The real distinction between educated and uneducated persons is not to be found in such superficial criteria as academic degrees, formal study or accumulation of facts; indeed, formal learning may, and often does, lead people into narrow acholarship and out of life."" p.110 His philosophy is enlightening and thought provoking."
1,Same stuff,"Disappointed that this Cd has so many songs from the other DF CD I bought...........like 35% are the same songs........that's not really fair..........oh, well.........had I looked I might have avoided this........FYI."
1,the third cd has been disappointingly unmelodic,"I am a huge Deep Forest fan, and loved the first cd they came out with. The music was beautiful. The second cd, although not quite as good, was still very nice. The melody was still there, the beat was still good, and you could sit back and enjoy. I'm sad to say that the 3rd album seems awful to me. The only song i really liked was the 'media luna'. The voices were beautiful, espeically the woman's. The other songs were pretty lame. No beat, no melody, nothing to draw the listener in. Annoying rather than relaxing."
3,Least favorite Deep Forest album,"Sadly, this is my least favorite Deep Forest release. While their first two albums were intense world music influenced ambient treats, this one is much more pop influenced, with hard edged beats, latin rhythms, and generally a very 'happy' feel so much different from their more melancholy first two albums. Certain tracks have an infectious quality to them, like ""Noonday Sun"" and ""Green and Blue,"" but many others feel like so much filler. ""Media Luna"" is the only track that I really love. Overall, this one was a disappointment."
4,Another of Deep Forest's feelgood albums!,Deep Forest has done it again! another feelgood album...and very good driving music too! i am buying a copy for my sister's wedding! all of the others (deep forest's albums) have stacked up... particularly Boheme! when i compare deep forest with enigma...enigma seems (somehow) boring...--rexifelis
5,Great!,Really a great CD! Its been in my CD-player in the car for more than 2 month now. Something no other CD have acomplished...
5,"If you like to be crazy and artistic, this CD is for you!",Deep Forest is a great CD just to relax to but it's also a great one to dance to! It has a calypso/african dance beat with invigorating lyrics. But #11 soothes you into another world of peacefull serinity. DEEP FOREST has a definate #1 on this one. I reccommend it to any world music lover!
5,Wonderfully light,"Deep Forest's third CD called Comparsa is wonderfully light and highly spiritual. As usual in their music, there is an element of folk music from different continents - this one represents some tribal sounds again. It is happy, stunning. My four-year-old daughter adores it. Great dancing tunes on top of dramatic, meditative scores. Highly recommended!"
1,Not so good!,"This book was very disapointing. I was hoping for some new ideas to spice up the bed room, but this has a bunch of things most people have probably already thought of. Very basic, not very original. Spend your money elsewhere"
2,"Very cute, but doesn't stay on the spout!","I love the way this looks, but it does't stay on the spout, so isn't worth much as a spout protector!"
3,Works Great But....,...it made our faucet loose. This is ok if you never take the cover off. But we had to take it on and off a few times and it made our fauct loose. I'd recommend this for anyone who plans on leaving it on and not removing it very often.
3,Cute,"Cute turtle. Works well, but I wish they had a cut-out in the head for my shower pull so I didn't have to take it on & off all the time."
4,Does exactly what it's supposed to,"Works like it's supposed to, my monkey boy doesn't scrape himself on the faucet while taking a bath anymore. It holds on tight and looks cute. The only downside might be that you have to take it off every time you want to take a shower if you have the integrated shower switch on top of the faucet (you are unable to get to it otherwise). Other than that little inconvenience, I highly recommend it!"
1,useless as a safety item,I agree with Jack's mom. My infant can get this off EASILY. Waste of money.
4,Great safety item.,This turtle is very cute but also very effective. It slides on easily and protects my little one's head.
2,Not very good.,Not much new here. Just a book to profit off Stings fame. Not very good reading. Buy at your risk.
3,You better like coconut,I bought these tablets because they do not contain sucralose like other chewable calcium + D. They have a very strong coconut flavor. I'm going to use them but will keep an eye out for other options.
5,Greco Roman World,This is a very informative book that gives you a peek of what it must have been like during the early centuries.
