1,"As unbelievable as ""The Firm"" and just as poorly written.","I am a great John Grisham fan, but NO ONE IN HIS RIGHT MIND WOULD BELIEVE THIS DRIVLE! While everyone knows that juries can be manipulated to a certain extent, even the most loyal Grisham fan would pass on this one."
3,Well... What can I say?,"It was good, yes... The beginning is very attention grabbing. Right from the start you are into the book; however, Grisham fails to use this to his advantage. It started off grabbing my attention, but failed to keep it. As I read on, I slowly became rather bored of the book, and the urge to ""pick it up again and keep reading,"" faded away.The plot was very interesting... The book was well written, and the twists were great. Like I said though, the main problem with this book was that it did not hold onto my attention. It began to drag along in several parts. I would recommend this book to someone who is heavily into law books, who may be more interested in some of the less entertaining parts than I was."
4,4.5 stars,Another winner by Grisham! I don't want to sound like a broken record so I'll just say that this man can truly TELL A STORY!!!
3,Just Not a Grisham Fan.,"I finally finished Runaway Jury. Let me tell you, it became a chore at one point! This is why I don't or can't read Grisham. It feels like it takes a million years to finish one novel!With that said, it was actually pretty good. I really wanted to see the movie when it was out. See, that's my thing with Grisham. I have enjoyed almost all of the movies they have made out of his books, I just can't read him. His writing is a bit cumbersome. When they turn the novels into movies, that element of feeling bogged down is gone for the most part. The plot was excellent, as was the character development, but the novel moved a little too slowly for my tastes. Very interesting plot though. Makes one wonder if it could or has ever happened in our legel system (i.e. the purchasing of a verdict). I am sure it has."
4,"Magnificent, Excellent, Couldn't be better.","This book is great, once you start reading it, you can't put it down until you know the truth. This novel is better than his previous one ""Chambers"". If you haven't start to read it, GO AHEAD"
4,"TYPICAL GRISHAM, FAST PACED, VERY READABLE AND FAR-FETCHED","VERY SIMILAR IN STYLE TO HIS PREVIOUS BOOKS, AND LIKE MOST OF THEM, THEY TAKE A SERIOUS SUBJECT AND STRETCH THEM TO THE LIMIT. A VERY ENJOYABLE READ, BUT STILL NOT ON PAR WITH HIS FIRST 3 NOVELS. NOTHING EVER REALLY GOES WRONG FOR THE HERO. I DID ENJOY THE INSIGHTS OF JURY DUTY, ALTHOUGH, THE REALITY IS THAT MOST JURIES AND PROSPECTIVE JURORS ARE TREATED AS SUB CLASS PEOPLE. IF YOU ARE A GRISHAM FAN READ THIS AND IF YOU HAVE NOT READ JOHN GRISHAM BEFORE READ THIS ABOUT 4TH ON THE LIST"
4,"As always with Grisham, kept me turning pages!","John Grisham is what I like best in an author, reliable.Everything I've read of his has been first rate, exciting prose. Hehas the ability to put one in the shoes of his character. I will never resist the impulse to pick up one of his new novels, and I have never been disappointed yet!"
5,"great, great, great, etc.","This book is without a boubt, one of the best books that grisham has ever written. His style of writing has fascinated me from the very beginning, he is without a doubt a writer that is going to get great reviews."
1,Not impressed. A little insulted.,"The first John Grisham book I read was The Partner. After reading that book I was hooked. This book, however, was slow and a little tedious. I just skimmed through several pages. His protayal of blacks and other's religious beliefs was offensive. This is the last John Grisham book I will read."
1,Stinking,"This book is a stinking pieece of garbage. It is so disgusting I can't bear to read it anymore. John Grisham and his idiotic juries! Why is every stinking book he has ever written has the word jury in the title and has something to do with them. And the jury in this book isn't even runaway. I bought this book thinking that it would be about a jury who refuses to do a case and runs away. Instead, it's about some jerk who tries to bungle a case involving a tobacco company and some ol' Southern drawler. For garbage, this is your best bet."
4,not the best but not bad,"This one's good but certainly not his best book. Anyway, a widow is suing a tobacco company for millions of dollars two years after her husband dies of lung cancer. A miserly jury picker by the name of Rankin Fitch picks his jury and the case is ready to begin. Everything is going well until they get mysterious calls from a Marlee who tells them predictions of the next day like the jury will perform the pledge of allegience. These predictions come true leaving Fitch to wonder if there is a person on the inside. There indeed is and his name is Nicholas Easter or is it? His past is a mystery and soon the jury follows his lead. Then strange things start happening. The jury goes on strike and one man claims he's being followed. Could this be Fitch?"
4,My First Grisham's,My first experience with a courtroom thriller by Grisham was unexpectedly great. This happened barely one year ago and now I already read more than half of John Grisham's novels.This novel is somehow relavant to read during this time as the State's juries are willing to give enormous amount of money to ordinary citizen in order to give 'lesson' to the multinational companies. I doubt that the juries did read this book and get the wonderful idea of 'donating' money and how horror it is to those who get the nasty consequence of others ill-doings.This book is highly recommended to all lovers of Grisham's unique way of story telling.
3,Hummm,This would have been great had it been labeled used so I knew I was purchasing my Grandson a used gift that was faulty. The other LeapFrog was new and worked great!!
5,Fun to read,"I had been assigned this book for a college course on (duh) the history of books. Before the semester had started, I had actually read the entire book, really geeky yes, but it was a wonderful book! It was engaging and full of images. It made me forget that I was actually learning something! I would highly recommend this book to anyone."
4,It's Smithsonian so the quality is there..,Overall I'm satisfied with the book's quality in production. I'm on the fence on some of the content but that's a personal matter altogether.
4,Nice atmospheric acoustic-based album,"I happened upon this CD by chance and listened to a song sample here and immediatly bought it. I had heard a few Gene Loves Jezebel songs in the 80's, but this is much different. Very mesmerizing, and Aston has a unique voice. ""The Lighthouse"""" is one of the most beautiful impressionistic songs I've heard."
1,"This is nothing like Aston's old band, Gene Loves Jezebel","This is pretty dismal stuff. Tuneless and lacking in ideas. I bought it because I loved Aston's old band Gene Loves Jezebel, but this is nothing like their best stuff."
5,Needle in a haystack,"I had been looking for this CD at music shops and on the Internet since 1994, when I heard it for the first time. It's one of the best Jazz/New Age albums ever recorded, yet it's also almost impossible to find.It's Max Lsser's masterpiece."
5,A terrific addition to the parenting literature,"I am a married mother of sons who is also a psychologist. Dr. Drexler's excellent book is a much needed resource for all parents, educators, clergy, and anyone who has an interest in children or better still, in the future of our society. Her warm and accessible tone, her understanding of the importance of what it takes to be a responsive, empathetic parent, and her honest assessment of what today's families ""look like"" are just some of the reasons this book should be read by as many people as possible. Dr. Drexler appreciates what children need to grow and thrive; love, understanding, kind and compassionate role models, people who care and listen and who guide them to be the best, most responsible citizens they can be."
1,Sad,"Regardless of the science one uses (IVF, sperm donation), it always takes a male and a female to create a baby. ALWAYS. The notion that fathers are unimportant after conception is downright dangerous and purely ideologically driven. Heaven help our society."
1,Horrible Book-Shame on You,"To think someone actually wrote this book. Worse yet is that the reviews with 5 stars are bunched together to create the real picture of what evil lurks out there. Fathers AND mothers ARE important to our children. To even think otherwise is to deny our humanity. What does this author think should happen to these boys that are being raised without dads should do when they become dads and the mother decides their being a dad is not important. what a web and circle of evil this author weaves. If you love our children, both male and female, don't even waste a dime on this book. Take your child out for an ice cream. At least ice cream has value. My copy of this book found its home in the rightful place: ""The Trash""."
2,This book is very important,"This book serves a very critical purpose in disspelling the popular myth that children are best served by having a married mother and father in the home.Peggy Drexler is currently working on a new book about how much better off girls are when raised in home without women. The evidence is showing that girls who are raised by men are far less likelly to be overly emotional. They have a much higher level(and healthier) level of competitiveness. They are also less likely to nag their partners as adults.Of course, Drexler does not minimize the importance of having female role models available for girls in single male households. These role models are important for teaching girls how to apply make up and do their hair.Yes, Ms. Drexler is helping to advance our society by debunking the old two-parent myth of the past. We will anziously await her new volume on Men Raising Girls without Women."
1,Shoddy research,"Drexler seems to forget that anecdotal evidence cannot be used to justify the type of claims she's making in this book, which is riddled with biased sample and hasty generalization fallacies. Drexler makes sweeping statements about the efficacy of single mother parenting without even attempting to clearly define her definition, let alone establish a double blind study or make any other attempt whatsoever to compensate for her bias. Instead, she relies on anecdotal evidence supplied by individuals who were clearly selected based on whether or not their stories support her conclusions."
3,Wasn't exactly what I'd hoped.,"I am a single, straight mother raising two young sons alone. I ordered this book because I fear the boys might be missing out without a father in the house. Although the book has some great summary tips about things mother's can do, it seems to focus mainly on lesbian couples raising boys. I didn't find most of that information helpful, as it does not apply to my situation. There was very little in the book targeted at single moms doing it alone. And on top of that, Amazon.com's ""suggestions"" to me were two books about lesbians. Hahaha, I'm not really offended, and have an open mind, but I need a book JUST for single moms without a partner."
1,"""Without men"" huh?","I wonder how many women who claim to raise children ""without"" men are actually receiving child support, even as they deny the man access to his child? Certainly not all women without active male partners would do this, but it is incredibly common.Such women remain dependant upon a man, yet they dare to tout some notion of independence? They are simply lying to themselves. Worse, they harming their children in the process.Feminists should be outraged at a women who would do this! So much for female empowerment.Are such women ""maverick moms,"" or are they self-righteous hypocrites?"
1,Single Largest Group of Abusers of Children,"After reading the reviews on this tripe about exceptional men raised by maverick moms, I'll offer that when it comes to statistical data, single mothers acting alone are the largest group of perpetrators of abuse of children than any other group. And this you'll find in the book, ""The Diary of a Patient Man, A Father's Struggle.""The Diary of a Patient Man, A Father's Struggleand the data as I found comes from research conducted across several states, and several hundreds of thousands of victims each year. As a father of an exceptional little girl, I won't be wasting my money on this book. But, if you are an exceptional mother, you might order the book above to see how mavericks sociopath mothers abuse men and children."
1,You Go Away Girl!,"As Caitlin Flanagan pointed out in the Atlantic Monthly, this book is just ""the latest entry in the ever growing field of `You go, girl!' studies""-feel-good junk science designed to help women feel proud of whatever choices they make, no matter what effect those choices actually have on their children or themselves.This toxic mind trash should be avoided at all costs. Yes, women can raise exceptional boys on their own, but it is in spite of not having a man around, not because of it. One wonders how much better the boys would turn out with two committed parents. Where else will they see the proper image for marriage and romantic love modeled? A single mom can do a lot, but not that. If you want to rationalize poor decisions you've already made, this book is for you-if you want the truth, better keep looking!"
1,Another attempt at denying reality,"An amazingly small sample size well vetted to ensure the results are what the author wanted them to be, and this book is the result. This is rationalizing at its finest, and the harm it will do to the boys of the women who read it for validation is immense.The truth is that intact couples provide the best chance for their children. No, it isn't a sure thing, and single mothers can have fine boys, but the chance is much less for those lads (and lasses) than for those with both parents in the household, working together.I worked for a state prison system for ten years. The men and women there were overwhelmingly brought up by a single mother, over three-quarters of them. I do not have a Ph.D or fine words, but my sample size was greater than Ms. Drexler's by three orders of magnitude. Do you want to see your son in prison? Then by all means believe in this book."
1,If I could give this a zero I would.,"The only thing worse than her research is her pure hatred poured onto every page like some invalid emptied their colostomy bag on a blank book and let some weathered crone divine words from the stains. Anyone with reason and critical thinking can quickly find research that clearly shows children raised by single mothers are much more likely to have a terrible future.They drop out of school at higher rates.They do drugs at higher rates.They have teen pregnancies at higher rates.They get involved with gangs at higher rates.They go to jail in higher rates.Down-vote this, say bad things about me, I don't care. If I can keep even just one more person from wasting their time on this garbage I've done my job.The ""author"" should have her head examines as well as anyone who thought this was anything more than pure and simple hate speech.Don't insult your own intelligence by thinking about this book anymore.I sure won't."
5,read the book!,"This is a must read for anyone interested in the American family as it actually is--not as it xists in sepia prints from the hoary past. I heard Dr. Drexler speak last summer, which motivated me to buy and read this excellant book.If i had read only the negative reviews at Amazon I would have had a most distorted notion about the book and about Dr. Drexler. The proof is in the pudding--anyone who reads the book will learn important things about our society."
1,Kinship systems vs. individuals,"Drexler is a trained psychologist, and therefore thinks of the family's role as turning out a well adjusted individual (empathetic, motivated, etc). But the issue of single-parent vs. nuclear family structure is more about multi-generational replication of kinship organization. It's about social architecture over the long run. And, not just about boys and men, but also girls and women. It's about giving meaningful roles to both sexes for childraising, sharing the energy burden, and social inclusion. Go into the prisons and juvenile detention centers, and do a survey of the family structure these inmates were raised under, Ms. Drexler. Ask about the pressure cooker of single parenting, and the lower ability of single parents to stave off drug addiction vs. parents with a committed partner. Then, crunch the data. You'll arrive at a different conclusion. Could be your next book!"
2,Not quite sure what to think about this,"My husband and I are raising our (adopted) son.I can only imagine what Ms Drexler would have tosay about raising a boy without women. For therecord, our son shows no signs of becomingmaladjusted, feral or sociopathic - nor has heexpressed any signs that he feels a lack offemale presence in his life.My husband expressed an interest in adopting agirl - imagine what people would have to say abouttwo men raising a daughter."
1,Another female author who likely hated her father,"This type focus has become too typical of many female authors. When will this ""type"" admit that boys are different (as are girls - and I have both). A book for eunuchs."
1,Feminist Tripe,"Another ""feel-good"" book directed at lesbians who insist fathers aren't necessary in the raising of boys. They are SO WRONG. Unfortunately, their guinea pigs are the children. The author limits her samples to white, upper class lesbians and single mothers. To say her sample is skewed is an understatement."
1,"Great Story, Bad Construction","The story is great for children, but the book itself was not satisfactory. I received it in time for Christmas, but I can not give it as a gift because some of the pages are ripped, the print is off center, and some of the pages are stuck together. It's like Quality Control never looked this one over before it got shipped out.I don't know who to point fingers at on this one, but I am disappointed!"
4,Loved it!,"This was a favorite of my daughters when they were little. So, I just had to get it for my granddaughters to enjoy. They loved it just as much. It is cute and witty and funny. The young child in your life will love it too."
2,Don't Bother,"Although the illustrations look amusing, once this book arrived I was disappointed with it -- the story was really simplistic and boring. Wasn't funny until the last couple of pages (where the char can't stop laughing)... Reading 'ha,ha,ha' is not my idea of a funny book - my 2yr old son has shown no interest in it since the first time we read it."
5,Simple and to the point.,"Simple in layout as far as the book, but you still have to study and practice. I like how the instructions are to the point, and the diagrams are easy to follow. Better than other books and charts (posters) I have had. It's actually fun just trying the different styles of scales to what you can do with them."
5,"This book was hilarious, I fell out of bed reading it",The best part of this book was when Paul was talking about the full length rat coat I thougth I would die. No matter how many times I read it through the book was even funnier.
5,"so funny, i couldn't put it down",i brought this book to work one day and now i think my co-workers think i went nuts. it is simply the funniest book i have ever read. his humor and sarcasm on everyday life is easily related by his readers. i bought a few copies of the book and gave it to friends -- they loved it too.
2,"Funny, but only 10% about couples and relationships","I read this book thinking it would be about couples and the sometimes humorous ways they relate. Instead I got one sentence per chapter about a 'couple' issue and the rest of the chapter is about other life observations. It would have been much better if he just would have called it ""Life Observations"" - at least then I would know what I was in store for -- but maybe that would have been too Seinfeld.Another reviewer wrote this book was so great on audio - I'm sure it is because all it seems like are transcripts from stand-up routines. I suspect that may be how the book was written - that's why it has no flow.Anyway, I found it humorous in parts - but had to give it 2 stars because it had hardly anything to do with couples."
4,The best humor in such a serious manner.,"Paul Reiser's Couplehood is a great read. He shows to be not only a wonderful comedian but an excellent lover. His knowledge on Coupledom in the 90's is oustanding. Reiser gives examples in a comic way, of how to make love - while making love. This book shows how easy it is to create love and how easy it was to delude it."
5,Funniest book I've ever read!,"In this book, Paul Reiser is as funny as he is on ""Mad About You"", if not funnier. You'll laugh from cover to cover, and when you're finished, you'll read it again. That's what I did. It'll make you realize the power of love and why we crave it so much. Whether you're in a relationship, was in a relationship, or want to be in a relationship, this book is your bible. It's a perfect present for couples who are about to get married and I highly recommend it to everyone"
2,An amusing look at relationships,"This is a light, fluffy read. While it is funny, it really just brushes the surface of its subject matter and never tackles them at any great depth. In a way this is a shame, as relationships provide so many opportunities for stories. This book was clearly intended to take advantage of the success of Reiser's television show, but doesn't provide any additional insights or much in the way of new material. I enjoyed it as a distraction, but I'm glad I wasn't looking for anything thought provoking."
1,Only one page out of the whole book is funny.,"Only one page out of the whole book is funny. On that page, he talks about where people usually scrub again and again while taking a bath."
2,Good when it works,"If you can get this thing started, it works well. I bought this about 4 years ago - used it the first year, cursing each time I nearly sprained my wrists or hurt my shoulders trying to start the damn thing. The next year I started growing tired of starting this thing, and gave up on it. The following year it just wouldnt start, and now its just a lawn ornament in my back yard."
1,"Terrible, Independable Governor/Carburetor","I have owned this product for three years. When it works it is great. However, after a day of heavy use, the governor/carburetor loses it's ability to adjust to load. I had to have it rebuilt after washing the entire house and deck two years ago. Just this weekend, it worked dependably for one day and then on the second day I had the same problem. I am now looking to replace it with something different as I need some dependability."
2,"Cheap Price, Cheap Product","Guess I got what I paid for with this unit, have used it 3 times so far. Works well once it gets started, unfortunatly I find it near impossible to start. For some reason it does not get any gas when it's cold, I have to pull them plug and inject some in there as well as prime the heck out of it.Should have gone with an electric, they don't clean quite as well, and I thought the cord would be a hassle. In reality the cord and hose is not much more problem then just the hose."
4,Great Valued Washer,"I purchased this washer based on reviewers comments and I would have to agree after using it. It's the best comprised of PSI and price for home use. Not powerfull enough to get yourself into trouble, but enough to get the job done efficiently. It may take a couple of passes to really strip your deck, but for the cost it can't be beat. It would be nice to have a wheeled frame to move it around while your working, but that would add $50 to the cost, and you don't have to worry about the washer vibrating itself around the yard while your working. I bought it to refinish my deck, back yard fence, wash the paved back yard, brick and siding on my house (summer projects). So far, no complaints. I've washed my car with it as well--my advice, don't. Doesn't work like at the wash rack. This is the first pressure washer I've ever purshed and I'm very happy with it. It's in for quite a work-out this summer."
1,fuzzy math at Amazon,"Yesterday, Amazon had this washer on sale for 26% off for a total of $199. The next day, they list it for 43% off for a total of $239. If you look back in the reviews, you can see where people paid between $85 and $175 in the recent past. Is this Amazon trying to make a profit on all those poor people cleaning up after the wildfires in California???? Outrageous!!!!"
3,power washer,the power washer is well worth the money but the shipping sucks it doesent have a this end up on the box so its throwed in every witch way and that means oil everywhere in the motor and the box an the extras that come with it it works great does a great job just they need to learn how to pack and ship it the right way other then that i love it an it was about 100.00 cheaper then i couldeve gotten it around here thank yall
5,Great for the money,"I thought that this was an outstanding value for the money. After receiving the pressure washer, I filled it with oil and gas and it cranked on the 1st pull! From there I was able to quickly clean my sidewalk, driveway and deck with ease. The turbo nozzle really works well. I have used 4000+ PSI units, but I find this one to be a perfect size for most people's home use. It has sufficient pressure to get the job done in a hurry, but it doesn't pack the extreme force that wears your arms out and damages what is being cleaned. For $175 shipped, this package gets 5 stars."
4,Briggs & Stratton Pressure Washer,"This pressure washer has a lot of power! I have used it to clean siding, sidewalks, patio, and cars. I have had no problems. The detergent pump, which only works when in low pressure mode, doesn't seem to spray out great. However, that might be the detergent that I was using. Would be nice to have wheels on it, but it is very stable and easy enough to move to a new location."
2,If you need to read a Grisham book: read another book,The case was too easy. Where's the thrill in that??? They made a movie out of this??? Hopefully the movie is better and not as much a waste of time as I spent reading this book.
2,not well produced,"Not a great recording. we have another taiko drumming CD from a show we saw and it is much better, though still rather poorly produced. I don't think these shows translate well to CDs."
3,Japanese Taiko,"There were a few songs that i was able to use at my murder mystery dinner party. However, all of the songs are quite similar so I used other CD's to play throughout the evening as well."
2,Not What I Expected,"This is not Taiko drumming alone.....these are musical compositions. It reminded me of Copeland... I didn't like it and I gave it away, because I wanted only drumming."
2,Never buy it,There are a lot of things wrong with this game.But the concept of the game is fun and would be a good game without the low production values First every character is the same except broly. The game feels like it was rushed do to deadlines. The combat is clunky and sometimes my guy disappears in mid air. simpley put-the worst dbz game ever
3,Not what you'd think....,"Not as good as it was supposed to be. The minute I had bought the game, I was so excited until I played it and beat it in the next hour. The game is so short! This game let me down. This isn't the first DBZ RPG game because you have to take in account that The Legacy of Goku games and Buu's Fury and the other GBA games are RPG. Another letdown, only goes up to Cell saga. Only one character goes SS2 and there some stupid new mini saga with some guy they made up that goes after Freiza Saga. A lot of glitches. If you keep on fighting, you will eventually disappear from the screen, but your opponent can see you and still be able to attack you. I wonder why it's $39.99 for GCN but $49.99 for PS2 and Xbox? I'll give it a generous 3/5."
4,The Budoki Games Are Better,I brought the game beacuse I heard it was a adventure game insteed of a fighting one so I picked it up and decided to play it. After a few levals the game got a little boring but when you get to the end of each one you get to fight a boss which is the best part of the game.ProsLots of charectersFun BossesSceans From The AnmieConsBad CamraSome Pictures Messed UpNeeds The Buu SagaOver all there should be a sagas 2 with the other sagas and better graphics. If you want a DBZ fighting game get Budoki Thenkiichi.
5,Wii/Gamecube owners get DBZ Sagas!!,DBZ Sagas is amazing! I beat the game switching between one-player and two-player co-op with a friend and had a blast. The graphics are great and the combat system is good for a gamecube game. Even the more difficult combos you need to perfrom to beat the main bosses can be executed with ease after a little practice. I've played a lot of Dragonball video games and this is definitely my favorite (I am partial to platformers so I'm a little biased).
2,What happened!,"Ok, bottom line, DBZ budokai 1 and 2 sucked! I gave 1+2 a 2/5. but i gave 3 a 4/5! I was expecting the same thing in sagas. I wanted to love this game, but i didn't. The frustrating camera angles and bad gameplay makes this game suck. These dudes can fly! And yet, you can only get 6 feet of the ground is DBZ sagas! I don't care what anyone says, this a pathetic platformer. (...)"
1,"Glitchy, repetitive,and not much fun!!!","I bought this game when it first came out for $40. Total waste of money. I beat this game 100% in less than 6 hours with everything unlocked. The boss AI was pitiful, sometimes you could avoid boss attacks by levitating 1 foot off the ground. That's not even counting the glitches. Quite frequently me and my enemies disappeared completely. Twice a boss went underground and never came back up. And more times than I can count, when I got knocked down my character got stuck in the falling animation, meaning I did not hit the ground until I got hit again. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!"

1,Boss??? Never again !!!,"It will never buy a Boss radio again , it's was installed and 2 weeks later the radio was just death.. how come??? I could not recommend Boss, it just does not work as I expected, never again.Now what ??? no radio , no nothing ! I hope someone can assist me... either from Boos or Amazon. [...]"
1,#1 i oder diferent stuf and only 2weeks later they they answer me,This company only today (09/09/08 ) figer out that they have wrong discription of their product anthey didn't have what I order
5,A spectacularly written book!,"A spectacularly written book, Evans portrays his characters vividly...It's not just any author that can bring his characters to life...Superb dialouge; great displaying of emotions; there's no way around it, Evans is a provactive author and this is a wonderful book."
2,A Total Disapointment!!,"I was expecting at least a decent story, due to all the good reviews of friends and fellow horse owners/riders, but this book was pitiful. It dragged on and on, supported bad values and morals, and was totally empty, with unrealistic events and characters. I can't believe so many people think it's a ""classic"", or ""one of the best reads of their life"". I hope Evans keeps practicing, 'cause this book sucked!!"
2,Animals: yes. Humans: no.,"When the author is involved with the relation between animals and humans there is much to learn and the writing is on the mark. When he turns to relations between humans and humans, however, there is nothing new: no insight, just ordinary soap-opera drivel. The book is a slam-dunk animal book with a tacked-on love-story that goes weak in the knees, and an ending that finishes things without really ending them. I understand there is to be a movie from this book. It's a sad commentary on the state of affairs in the movie business when this is considered movie material. Still, if the reader wants a fast, cheap, no-brainer read, buy this in the remainder section..."
2,a big dissapointment,"This was a VERY dissapointing book! It is amazing, though, how many readers had so many different opinions on it! I thought it was so bad because it dragged on and on and on and on....(you get the point) I wanted to throw it away. I'm so glad I didn't pay for it.. a relative gave it to me saying how great a book it was, and that the suprize ending was worth waiting for..YEAH RIGHT!"
1,Montana lies dimisnished,"I'm in a remote place and found a book I'd hear mentioned and thought ""wow! I can get current!"" Please, I love being remote...the book had few enlightening moments, the only purity of thought and feeling I felt was for the friendship between Grace and Joe. The rest were cardboard caricatures and lifeless...poor Robert, was he the eunuch or what? I rarely come away hating a book and it's characters but this came darn close...Madison County was close too...the only spark of interest and light came on page 199 when the author mentioned Wallowa County Oregon...he had to have heard that from someone cause you won't find it by yourself! Please stick with your day job Mr. Evans!!"
3,A solid 6,I really liked this book until they started having the affair. I don't know why it turned me off. I've read plenty of other books where people are having affairs and haven't been offended. Maybe it was that Robert didn't deserve it or that Annie wasn't likeable. Or maybe it was just so predictable. I don't know. The ending surprised me for sure. I'd recommend it to others.
4,It is okay!,"I think a strong resemblance to ""The Bridges of Madison County"" can't be denied. But what's wrong with that? I read the Horse Wisperer first and really liked it. It's no waste of time to read this book, even if you already know ""The Bridges"". Why not read a similar plot twice if you like it?"
3,Copy of Madison County?,"I couldn't warm up to Annie, therefore I didn't feel she was worthy of this adulterous affair. I just saw her as a bitter, mean woman who cheats on her husband. Robert is such a nice man who doesn't deserve her. Grace is a real heroine who shows amazing courage to overcome her disability...signs of which she showed before she met Tom Booker. I also didn't feel the ""magic"" between Annie and Tom."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"Where is the story of the man who whispered to horses? An eighteen wheeler, two horses, and two young girls. A tragically gruesome accident, and a changed horse. A mother who tries to heal the horse, herself, and her daughter. Her affair with Tom was predictable and only slightly intriguing. But the ending fell flat. What of the characters Grace and Robert? Are we to believe that they will be forever content while Annie spends her life doting on the product of her love affair? And what was the child's name anyway, TOM? Tom Booker, an almost- believable character, sacrificed himelf to the fiercely fighting stallion in a Madame Butterfly/Miss Saigon fashion. Oh, pu--lease!No, this novel did not work for me. And as for the movie, I will probably go hoping to see some beautiful scenery and some horses, But all I can say is that I hope Hollywood and Robert Redfern can fix this one up!"
2,It Made the NY Best Seller List; You've Got to be Kidding!,"The book started out very well; it was engaging mainly because the characterization was strong and the plot was heroic. However, my interest and enjoyment in the story plummeted immediately after the romantic feelings of Booker and Annie were acted on. Not only did the storyline become offensive, but downright pathetic. Cliches that tried to justify the affair such as, living for the now, and, it had to happen/it was meant to happen, were not only unconvincing but infuriating. As for the ending, oh please! Everything falls apart. Tom's suicide was bad enough, but then Annie's ""miraculous"" pregnancy was enough to make me want to tear the book in two. Why Robert Redford, whom I admire as an actor and director, would choose this of all books to make into a film, is beyond me! Evans, in your next book, try to be a little less formulaic, predictable, and downright corny!"
2,Adultery is not heroic.,"This book was an incredible let-down. Am I really supposed to believe that all this woman's internal struggles were laid (pardon the expression) to rest by cheating on her husband?! How is this a ""love story""?!! The unsung hero of this story was the husband, who supported EVERYONE in his family unconditionally, and who was left out in the cold of NY while his wife romped around in Montana pursuing her own personal ""healing"". And the ending was just a symphony of contrived ludicrousness! I regret I wasted precious hours of my life on this book."
2,Good two-thirds of a book,"It seemed as if the author was two-thirds into a good story when his agent called to remind him that the manuscript was due the next day at noon. Evans hadn't figured out the ending, so he grabbed a bunch of sentences out of his pantry and whipped something up. The ending was not connected to the rest of the book. The Horse Whisperer was a good story that inexplicably became a run-of-the-mill romance. I've been had"
1,WHY?,"Although well written (especially for a first novel), there was no actual substance to the characters or plot or ending. I felt nothing for anyone (including the horse and I'm a horse lover!) and kept reading just in case there was something there. Actually, I read the book because I was sorely disappointed in the movie and gave the benefit of the doubt that the book should be better. So, after the movie and the book I felt like the old adage, ""fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me!"""
2,A little horse story with your smut?,"This book is severely overrated. The idea is great...Girl and family override trauma and misery via horse and insightful horseman. Nice idea. Too bad the adulterous sex had to get in the way. It really had some potential. The bond between horse and rider can be a magical thing, but unfortunately the author chose to focus on what sells rather than what is meaningful."
3,"Nice book, Movie is better though...","The first four chapters are excellent. Great writing i must say. To see how you can churn out a n even better movie than the book, you must watch the movie.Robert redford's done an excellent job i must add. Then read the book. you will enjoy it better..."
5,Extremely Good Book! Best I've ever read!,This was a wonderful book that draws your attention so you can't stop reading. An irresistable instant classic. You could read it over and over!
1,tearjerker,"What a disappointment! I was very anxious to read the horsewhisperer and had high expectations, but nope. I found this novel a tearjerker with flat characters who obviously don't seem to have any motives. The novel is very unbalanced. At the end it's really unbelievable. I think Evans must have been in a hurry. He really took the easy way out."
4,A fantastic story that won't let you go,"No one had ever heard of a horse whisperer before Evans wrote this book. On top of that, he brings us a story about four needy people in search of happiness, not to mention the horse. A really great, old fashioned story, the kind that is hard to put down, and that has real living people in it. Don't be mislead by the hard hearted jerks who give this book one or two stars. They are over-inflated intellectuals with no hearts. Buy this book and enjoy!"
2,Dissapointed,"Promising start, very good subject (I love horses), but turns into a cheap romance novel after the first half. Don't recommend it and for the first time I can say the movie was better than the book."
2,A potentially great story with an insulting finale.,"A great read that draws you in heart & soul, until the unbelievable ending. It was an insult to the noble Tom Booker to finish him thus--it just did not fit, did not work, with the rest of the story. The book is greatly weakened by the ending and thus is a disappointment, despite the evocative, lucid writing and interesting characters."
2,"The horse Whisperer is a book about soul, without the heart.","Evans starts out the novel with a disaster that gave me nightmares for a week. As disturbing as it was, I liked it because it was real...not sugar coated. I read on and I continued to think it was a book of harsh realities and warm moments. It was a great beginning. Unfortunaltley the end left something to be desired. Evans became wrapped up in the affair that was taking place rather then keeping the story going. It fizzled out at the end. A great beginning deserves a much better ending, it almost felt as if Evans put less effort into the ending. I did not like the ending. I thought it rather ridiculous."
2,"Some powerful scenes, but often self-consciously ""romantic""","The horrific wreck scene (beautifully described) and fascinating character of the girl are far more interesting than the so-called ""romance"" of the selfish and unbelievable adult characters who take over the major portion of the story. The book seems to lack a true heart."
2,The Movie is MUCH better than the book,I saw the movie before I read the book. I am glad that I saw the movie first because the book was so confussing at times that I just had to put it down sometimes. The starting of the book was better than half way though I just couldn't finish it. So I think the movie is very good.
1,Trendy nonsense,"This story is extremely over rated. I felt nothing after reading it, except so what? Save your eyes and read something else."
3,Terrible ending,"I picked up this book and found the writing engaging and the story interesting. Unfortunately, all that changed about two thirds through the book. The storytelling seemed to shift and the story line became unbelievable. I actually hated the ending so much it made me angry."
2,"Sentimental, Predictable, Disappointing","The first forty or fifty pages of this novel, about a teen and a horse-riding accident, are gripping. The rest of the novel is not. It's overwritten (unnecessary words, sentences, and scenes), the characters are two-dimensional, and the plot is predictable. A disappointment."
5,A well-written horse lover book,"I saw this movie quite some time ago. Recently scrolling thru the kindle books I came across this book. It was so well-written I could not put it down. All of the characters in the book were believable and the relationship between mother and daughter so real. They both fought thru their own demons in their life, with strength and courage and let them go. Tom, the whisperer, with his magical touch not only with pilgrim, but with Annie and Grace.. brought them all back from hell to happy beings. The love that Tom shared with Annie, was so deep that Tom just could not live without her. After reading it, I watched the movie again. This book blew the movie away! In all, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves horses and would also enjoy a very rewarding experience in love and life's lessons thru a book that is well worth the time to read."
4,Perfect!!,I loved this book.I bought it two weeks ago cause I had seen it in the bestsellers.I read it and loved it.I'm interested in horses and this book reminded me of my horses in Montana.I loved Annie's character because she helped Grace as much as he could.And I was fascinated by the idea of giving plane tickets to Tom Booker.
4,A very good book.,"I saw the movie before I read the book. I was surprised that the movie and book followed pretty closely, except for the ending. I found that shocking. Although it was a good book I found all of the characters annoying. Annie is too *****y, Tom and Robert are too nice and to me Annie doesn't deserve both of them. And if Grace were my child, I would never allow her to be so sassy. Thought the characters were irriating at times the meaning of the story was well done. I applaud Mr. Evans. Go out and read this book!!"
3,Go See the Movie Instead,"I just saw Robert Redford's beautiful movie version of The Horse Whisperer last night. I must say that I loved what he did to the story. Redford took out all of the sleaze and trash that made the last third of this book so awful and transformed it into the magical story about horses, families, and healing that I think the author originally intended. I give Redford credit for not selling out with cheap sex scenes like the author seemed to think he had to do. Do yourself a favor and save your reading time for something more worthwhile."
2,Gutter language and trashy scenes. Lack of a real story.,"I was very disappointed from the very beginning of this novel. Evans peppers his story with gutter language and trashy scenes (the mark of a poor writer with little to say). Many readers, like myself, had hoped for a quality book with depth and literary value. Sadly, I'm also disappointed in the publisher who seems to think that everyone lives in the gutter. One good note is the the wonderful title and cover."
1,Smarmy and uninteresting,"Perhaps the new edition that has been released in anticipation of Redford's movie will force the editors to actually read the contents of this novel. The edition I read completely lacked commas and looked as if an editor had never put a pencil to the manuscript. The story is sappy, predictable, and not even worthy of escapist reading. I don't understand why everyone loves this book."
1,"Shallow, poorly plotted, poorly constructed","More and more the American public, perhaps because entertainment is delivered so passively to us via the television set, is unwilling to work hard for its literature. We've seen how shallow, nonsensical stories with shallow, nonsensical characters have become grossly popular. The true read -- one that entertains but also provides knowledge, moral value and judgement, and the intensity of human possiblities -- is sadly passed over in the rush to trivial escapism. This book is a sad example of this new cultural ethic. Fortunately, the film extracts the novel's plotline and then runs with it, creating a magnificent and moving story that you wish Evans' had been able to imagine. Skip the book -- go see the Redford movie."
5,Superlative,"I don't think I have ever read and enjoyed a book as much as ""The Horse Whisperer"". Absolutely fantastic. The ending was incredible, so moving and perhaps.... inevitable!? I've been counting down the days for the movie. When we first read the book a couple of years ago, my mother and I were trying to decide who would play Tom in a movie. We thought of Sam Elliot, but of course, Robert Redford was excellent. I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed in the ending of the movie, but on the other hand, I don't know if I could have made it through. It was hard enough to read the book. So many tears........ I think I just might buy this movie when it becomes available."
5,What?,"What? Is this the BEST book that I have ever read? YES!!Nicholas Evans is the writer of the century! His very first book, and I, a full-time reader,was just spellbound at the way that this peice of mere fictionhad me so excited, that I was scared to read another book. Surely no otherbook that I could read would be anywhere near this good! Andso far, none have. Praise God for Nicholas Evans! And Nick, if your reading, we are in a state ofcat-like readiness, anxiously awaiting your next book!"
1,"Joann says, ""HORSE MANURE"".","Thank GOD I did not purchase this book. It was forced on me by a well-meaning friend ! CHILDISH, PREDICTABLE and FOOLISH...Poor horse research. Better title would have been "" The Horse Pooper "".PHEW.."
2,Cliched - reads like 'The Book of the Movie',Honestly I can't imagine what the fuss is about this book. I expected it to have some more emotional depth - if someone had told me that the movie (which I haven't seen yet) had been written first and this was derived from the script I wouldn't be surprised. The whole thing is predictable right from the start and the characters are pure cardboard. There wasn't a single development I didn't see coming pages away. The only remotely interesting characters are the horse and the little girl who is hurt and towards the end of the novel they are sadly neglected in favour of an affair between two people who ought to have known better. Needless to say moral issues are ignored in favour of overwhelming sentimentality and characters undergo the sort of personality changes usually not seen outside the world of soaps - eg a ruthless and ambitious businesswoman suddenly seems content to become a stay at home mother.
2,a disappointment,"I did not see the movie, but the advertising blitzkrieg made me curious about the novel -- so I bought it. Almost from the very first page, the book was a disappointment. The description of the psychological turmoil of the main characters is something N. Evans should stay away from; maybe he is knowledgeable about horses, but the knowledge did not translate into the story. The second point was a special disappointment since I had hoped to find an intelligent, ""horsey"" book (read to ""Horse Heaven"" if you are looking for that).Having stated the negative, I admit to having finished the novel, and not only because I was stuck on the plane for several hours."
2,Thought it would be great and it just wasn't,"The plot about the horse and the girl was excellent and original. The ""love"" story between the whisperer and Grace's adulterous mother, left much, much to be desired and was like a bad re-make of Bridges of Madison County. The ending is completely nonsensical--none of the characters would have acted how indicated except for the sap that is Grace's mother. You like Grace's father too much for the adultery to fly. I had heard nothing but good things about this book and was stunned I didn't like it."
3,"Love the book, except for the ending","This book is a great read, especially if you love horses, like I do. I love the character, Annie because everyone tells her to destroy the horse, Pilgrim and she refuses. She's my hero for not giving up on him. The ending falls apart, though. It's almost as though the author didn't know when to quit. The movie was perfect. Just the way I wanted to see this one end. Skip the book and watch the film."
2,Books are always better ... just not this time.,"This book was pure junkfood for the brain. It was a quick, fun read, but there was little or no substance. The ending was as contrived as I've ever read. The saving grace (no pun intended) is that at least Robert Redford saw fit to change the ending in the movie! I must say this is one of the few books I've read that was better as a movie (which says more about the quality of the book than the movie)"
2,"Great book until the last 100 pages, then trash.","This book starts off very strong, with an interesting story, engaging characters and lots of tension. Unfortunately, about 3/4 of the way through, the tone of the book changes. The characters act out of character, makes dopey choices, and the book turns into a confusing, unsatisfying read. Felt like the author lost control of the story and took the cheap way out."
2,This book has been way overrated.,"I can't believe this novel has been made into a movie. I struggled and struggled to try to finish it because I didn't particularly care for the characters, who are underdeveloped. This book is trite, predictable, and made for those who read silly romance novels."
3,.,"I don't need to say much.. only writing this for amazon to update my recommendations. It wasn't my style of writing, the story wasn't quite right for me. But I still would think its beautiful for others."
1,Thank God it's over,"I read this book three months ago and still wake up with nightmares. Quick, someone take this man's computer before he writes another bomb. Tonight, however, I was dragged to see the movie and i have to say--thank God for Robert Redford. He and his two screenwriters saved Pilgrim and Annie. Finally, a ralistic ending."
4,"Strong start, slow finish","What a book! I fell in love with the characters (yes, even the horse!) and the story line at once. I read every page with anticipation of what was going to happen to my new ""friends."" However, the last few chapters were disappointing and the ending was a total let down. I didn't expect or want a fairy tale ending, but rather than dealing with the issues the characters were facing, Mr. Evans took the easy way out and left this reader at a loss."
1,Gag me with a Spoon!,"...This book reads like it was written with a screenplay in mind; there's no depth here, or feeling, or quality writing. The book is made up of polished, superficial scenes that will translate extremely well to celluloid and wil make very little impression on anyone who reads it. Cheesy and manipulative plot aside, even the horse whisperer himself failed to impress! He displayed a basic knowledge of horse psychology and a few tricks, and suddenly the world is aswoon over the ""magic horse trainers."" I was hoping for a real story about real people and animals; what I got was a made-for-Hollywood cheesefest by an untalented but ambitious writer. Incredibly disappointing."
3,"predictable, complicated story","It is evident that this is the author's first novel. I hope that just because it has become a movie, that Evans does not become satisfied with his work. The characters are mostly likeable, but suffer through this long, often complicated plot. The range of emotions that the reader is expected to feel is too great to allow them to enjoy this novel. It is very much like a sitcom drama. The great tragedy followed by the great aftermath, and finally the great conclusion. With this story, the great conclusion is a great relief. Hardly destined to become a classic, I would shelve this with the Danielle Steel and Jackie Collins summer beach reading material. There's no need to loose any sleep to try and finish this novel."
3,"...no long-term effects, recommended by doctors...","You can read ""The Horse Whisperer"" in two days. Some people will find this novel highly entertaining, perhaps even moving, others (""real"" Westerners in particular) will complain about the romanticized, stereotypical presentation of ""Big Sky"" Montana and the cheap ending. But ""The Horse Whisperer"" won't cause any long-term effects, positive or negative, in either group of readers. Reading this novel resembles listening to a Kenny G-tape: you like it or you don't like it, but it certainly won't change your life. ""The Horse Whisperer"" is a novel written for consumption (Hello, Hollywood!!), not for eternity. From that perspective, we can call Nicholas Evans' bestSELLER a very ""modern"" novel, no matter if you think it is great reading or just a big waste of time (and money)"
3,"Great potential, unfullfilled","I had mixed emotions to The Horse Whisperer. I thinkemotion is the operative word in this book. It startsout with so much gut wrenching agony and sorrow that Icried through the entire first half. I really empathizedwith Annie and her difficult plight. BUT the second halfwas a real disapointment. While I admit that the sexyscenes were thrilling, etc., I think that the author couldhave thought up a more imaginative way to heal Annie'sbroken family than to thrust her into an affair with thebooks' ""healer"". YUK. It's like a therapist sleeping withhis patient! How sleezy. I truely hope the author's nextbook stays realistic all the way through and doesn't lapseinto self indulgency too much."
2,Disappointing,"This book was going so well! The characters were well-developed, the plot was interesting. And then suddenly I found myself reading a bad Harlequin. What happened? The writing took a sad turn downhill (for instance, we hear Annie thinking to herself about two hundred times how strangely free of guilt she feels--didn't any of the editors notice that unnecessary repetition?).If you're going to read this book, stop halfway through it so you'll still think it's good."
2,Bridges of Madison County North,"Why did I think that I would glean some spiritual insights from this book? I was not sympathetic to the characters, and think the author is fortunate, indeed, to have gotten in on the slipstream of ""Bridges"""
1,what rubbish...,"cant believe this went to be a best seller....the writing is terrible, the characters unlikable, and Evans resorts to the same drivel that most romance writers on adulterous affairs use ie. it is beyond their control, meant to happen, etc. etc. BUT, the ending is such that it always remains bitter sweet, with no regrets, no guilt! The fact that this many people actually liked it says something about our morality as well as our literary sense."
2,This book is a waste of time.,"I never had any interest in reading this book, but when a friend I was visiting insisted I take it home with me, I felt compelled to read it. I thought this was supposed to be a story about a young girl and her horse instead of the trials and tribulations of her mother who is so obviously fashioned after Tina Brown. The book is so predictable, the affair was ridiculous and selfish and the end was not to be believed. The idea that Tom sacrificed himself like that made no sense to me and I can only feel sorry for Annie's husband who was a wonderful guy. I am glad to see that so many others thought this book was a sappy sham!"
2,"In retrospect, they should have shot the horse.","I was captivated by the beginning of the book, but when it turned in to a tawdry romance I felt betrayed. The ending was absurd, and I have to think that Grace will be even more shattered by Tom Booker's death than she was from the consequences of the truck accident."
1,An immoral story with a very disappointing ending.,"After struggling through The Horse Whisperer, I was left feeling betrayed by the author. The ending of this story was as morally bankrupt as it was implausible. I actually felt angered for having wasted my time reading this book."
1,"The horse could've died, and no one would've cared!!","I read this book expecting a heart warming tale about a horse and what I got was a book about an unlikable, selfish woman having an affair with a man that was supposed to heal the horse and the girl, but somehow got too tangled up in sleeeping with Annie to care. I'm only 13, and I didn't want to read about their sex life etc. All I wanted was a nice story with a horse in it. But this book is truly twisted and sick and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy."
1,Horses whisper in Madison County,"I had high hopes for a book so highly recommended by so many; but upon its completion I felt only anger for wasting time on it; with all of those stacks of wonderful literature awaiting me. I suggest that a baseline IQ or literature degree be required for those writing reviews. Inane, trite, nonsensical and just plain bad."
3,Had the author only understood his characters . . .,"Fortunately, I didn't have to pay for this book, because it irks me that Evans was paid so much for it when too often truly good writing and better storytelling goes unrewarded. That's not to say Evans doesn't have some talent as a writer. There were descriptions, phrases, and moments that captured my imagination, but Evans seems lost as a storyteller. He gets away with his ending (or so he thinks) by calling Tom a ""crumbled icon"" (although I had more the image of a 'crumpled' icon), which somehow justifies the cop-out ending as ""a symbol of salvation."" However, had Evans taken the time (the book comes off as having been written quickly) to explore his characters, especially Tom, as real people -- not icons -- he would have realized that the man who helped Pilgrim choose life would have made that same choice himself."
2,A Hollywood Sellout,"Like most of the reviews already posted, I, too, was hooked by the beginning of the book and then frustrated by the second half. I've read that Evans was signed for the movie rights before it was finished. My theory is that the book changes at that point in its composition. Evans becomes too aware of how it would play out as a movie and shortchanges the reader in the process. Ironically, Hollywood apparently wasn't too satisfied with it either. I hear the horse whisperer lives."
1,ran off the track,"this came highly recommended by several friends and since i have asked them ""What were you thinking?"" This was very corny overall. It began well enough but the characters were like Judith Kranz goes west, the ending was a cop out! how did this thing ever get published much less sell?!?"
2,"Actually 2 and a half stars, for the effort","I started off liking The Horse Whisperer. It is rich in descriptions and is quite insightful. Unfortunately, about half way through the book it started falling apart. The descriptions started to get longer, pointless, and started to drag the book down. Most writers seem to know when an experience has been retold too much, but Evans reiterates often and there are only so many ways to describe Montana's wilderness. Also, and far worse, I didn't like the characters. I didn't relate to them, I didn't care about them, and didn't truly understand them. I did enjoy it for the most part, though. When Evans stuck to the point, the descriptions were worth the read. For a first novel, it was quite good. I plan on reading his second novel, The Loop, to see if he has become more disciplined."
1,annoyingly predictable,I find it really hard to understand how this book ended up in all those bestseller lists. I picked it up because so many were apparently fascinated by it. What a disappointment! I guessed from the very beginning what was going to happen and it really annoyed me to find out I was right. Why all the fuss with horses and landscapes when all it leads up to is just another not very original lovestory. I'd vote for no star at all !
4,"A Book, I couldn't put down","The Horse Whisper, was a termendously good book. I would recommend it to anyone thinking of reading this book. I think of this book as a satory about a families struggle to overcome a very serious issue. I thought of this book as a little girl getrting into an accident, and a families struggle to recover from that."
4,"A gripping drama, a sloshy romance, and a tragedy","Well, talk about differences of opinion! Just read some of these reviews/ratings. I will defend the book. It grips you at the onset, keeps you wondering, even through the romance and maintains a good storyline and plot. Yeah, okay, maybe some sideplots were tossed in to make for what the author thought would be a more interesting novel (and some of it works). Overall, this is a readable tale, with a beginning that should snag you, and pull you through. I do not believe the movie will be better."
5,one of the most wonderful books ever written,"disgusted by adultry? a put down to women? wake up people. look beyond that and see the relationship between a mother and daughter. this book IS BEAUTIFUL! being a teenage daughter myself, i could relate to grace, and i know my mother could relate to annie. anyone who doesn't read this book because there may be a few punctuation errors will miss out on one of the most wonderful and moving books of our time."
5,I thought it was one of the best books I read,"When I first bought the book I thought I wouldnt like it. When I started reading it, the beginning really grabed me and kept me interested. It was a very touching story. I didn't like the end though because it happened so suddenly and the reader didn't even lead up to the idea. I dont think grace will be that devestated about his death. Well I cant wait to see the movie I got so excited when I found out they were making the movie. I think Nicholas Evans made a great first novel."
1,"""BRIDGES"" REINVENTED, UGH!!!","How hokey can you get. I kept hoping that the book would develop into something of substance, but then I felt the same way about ""Bridges of Madison County"". Either Robert was a complete dolt or he had no clue as to what was real."
3,An out-of-character climax!,"I found this book to be quite engaging, at first. The characters were well done and the situations set up well. Personally, I would have liked to see more interaction between Tom Booker and Pilgrim. I felt, from the information given by the author, that the fresh air and sunshine probably did Pilgrim more good than anything Tom did. Because the characters were realistic, the ending made absolutely no sense. Tom spoke more than once about going to the edge and deciding to survive. What happened was so out of character for him, it made me mad! I felt as though Mr. Evans had a deadline to meet and threw the ending together without much care or attention to detail. I would recommend this book as an exercise for young writers. ""Come up with an ending that makes sense in Tom Booker's eyes."" OR ""Come up with an ending that fits his philosophy of life."""
3,IT HAD VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH HORSES!,I bought the book thinking I was going to be reading a wonderful horse story only to find out that it was about a love affair! I would have rathered more about horses.
2,Why did Evans tire of writing????,"This was a terrific story until the last 100 pages - then it became a formula romance novel! I loved the tension, descriptions, everything - until the end. I felt let down in the end. I don't think Tom Booker would have reacted as he did in the book in real life - in Annie's mind, perhaps, but not in real life."
3,Not enough about the horse,"I bought the book thinking there would be more about the horse in it, but I guess it was about the ""Horse Whisperer"" not the horse. I thought it dragged on in parts, but I still cried while reading it."
4,wonderful and engrossing.,This book was hard to put down. It held my attention to the very end and the ending was alittle predictable but still a good book nevertheless. I bought it as a whim after hearing all of the good reviews and was not disappointed. You could really get inside the characters' heads and know how they felt. That is a sign of a good book.
1,"Disappointing, pedestrian, and facile","I tried. I really did try to enjoy this book. But its characters are predictable and underdeveloped and they STAY THAT WAY. The passages about the actual horse whispering stand out vividly from the rest of the book, but there are not nearly enough of them to support the rest of this lumbering mess. I had hopes--the subject is interesting and first books are often unexpectedly excellent. But the author was too busy covering his bets to actually write a compelling story. Hype wins again. I won't be looking for the sequel."
2,Dragged out love story,"Given all the hoopla about this book, I expected much better. It seemed like a long rehash of Bridges of Madison County. I found it poorly written and boring. Quite frankly, I was amazed that I actually finished the book. I also dislike love stories where people find their soulmate isn't their spouse."
1,"The First Half is great, too bad the second half Stinks","This starts out as a great book, with interesting characters and a good plot. Unfortunately, about halfway though the author decides to become a syrupy romance instead. The ending is as Cliched as a Daniel Steele novel, and as surprising as Barbara Cartland. I wouldn't recomend it as you'll only be disgusted with all the characters by the end."
2,Bang-up start:ending fizzled,"As with many readers, the beginning of the book held many promises- but alas, the transition from horses to a tawdry affair was disappointing. The ending left me dazed-I don't think that Grace would/should have been subjected to yet another senseless death"
5,Wonder with words........,"Nicolas Evans is an amazing writer. His use of words captivates his audience and keeps them waiting for more.... It is beautiful! This was the first book I read (cover to cover!) from him, and I liked it soooooooo much that I found another and read it cover to cover also! (The Loop)"
3,Good book..,"I really like Nicholas Evans, but this one isn't my favorite. Although, if someone is tempted to see the movie first, don't! The movie doesn't come close to how good the book is. Read the book first, for sure!"
3,The Horse Whisperer - something of a spoiler included,"I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this book - until it became clear that Annie and Tom were going to act on their feelings. Annie is a married woman. Do marriage vows mean nothing anymore? I also found the ending irritating - first Grace's behavior was just ""one more thing"" that could go wrong. Instead of making me feel sympathetic toward her, it irritated me. Then, the thing with Tom. I won't say what it was to avoid totally ruining the book for you, but it didn't seem likely. I THINK it was supposed to be romantic and/or tragic, but instead it was merely pathetic. Many of us (and nearly every teenager) has loved someone to the extent that we were quite certain that we wouldn't withstand the loss. Yet we do. Surely this isn't our notion of romance? It was quite well written and the performer did a great job of distinguishing the characters. All in all, I enjoyed it, but I was disappointed with the ending."
5,Heartbreaking love-story of monumental proportions.,"The Horse Whisperer is by far THE love story for the '90's. Mr. Evans writes, as if from first hand experience, about a woman in love with one man, but, married to another. She is torn between her desire to be with the easy-going, rough-neck, who is far from being her ""ideal"" man, and the man she promised to spend the rest of her life with.When her daughter suffers a terrible accident, our heroine calls on an old-fashioned cowboy to help bring her daughter's horse back from no-man's land. Never suspecting she would be attracted to this cowboy, she pursues him to Montana to convince him to help her with the horse. Finding herself drawn to him, she contrives to stay in Montana with him, and finds herself torn between her sense of duty, and the call eminating from her heart.A true heart-breaker; this book will reduce you to tears. I couldn't stop reading it, and finished it in one day!!!"
3,"Plot-driven, formulaic romance . . . Montana is lovely.","Savvy horse people will be pleased with some of Evans'descriptions of horse behavior, at least until he steps overthe line into anthropomorphism and tries to infuse extradoses of mystique into the ""horse whisperer"" mythology.(Horse whisperers are simply very talented trainers,empathetic animal behaviorists who take the time to trulyunderstand, love and communicate with their subjects. They are special, but not that rare; Iknow at least three.) Unfortunately, Evans seems tofathom the character of horses better than the character ofhis characters, who are mostly two-dimensional andpredictable. The deus ex machina ending is disappointingand improbable, and several major conflicts are leftunresolved (perhaps on purpose, to make the story more""real"" in its ambiguity.)Montana is beautifully drawn; I'd move there in an instant."
3,Book was a disappointment,"This book has a promising title, but the contentis that of romance novel that went astray. Theending is a cheating heart and the death ofthe Horse Whisper what a lame way to endthe book. Not only sad but senseless. I givethis book a 5 based on the fact I read itto the end but it never panned out itspromises of interest."
5,Rates up there as one of my all time favorites.,This book gripped me right from the start. Reluctantly put it down to go to work. Cannot wait to read further offerings from the author. Moved me to tears at the finale
2,I did not like this book,"Is the theme of this book to always act upon your desires? When Annie commits adultry we are told that she feels absolutely no shame or guilt; is that a good thing?She goes to Montanna to ""save"" her family and after her stay there decides to divorce her husband with the casual thought that her daughter will learn to live with it.This book bothered me on several levels. Annie was a selfish bitch at the start of the book and she basically remained that way at the end. There was no redemption here.And the self-sacrifice of Booker was a quick device to end the book. I think it made no sense whatsoever.I do not recommend this book."
3,horse,"I found this to be a fairly good book. It was hard for me to put it down once I got more involved in the story. I gave it only 3 stars because the ending was disappointing to me. It did not seem like a plausible ending for this book, it was almost as if the author wanted to wrap up the story within a certain number of pages. I think I would have enjoyed the ending if it would have detailed more of what happened to the characters, especially after the tremendous buildup to the climax of the book. All in all, aside from the ending, this was a very good read."
3,why drag in a horse to justify adultery!!,"for a first novel, the author deserves to be commended: the language is easy and in places delightfully fresh; his insights into human frailities would make a psychiatrist envious; and his descriptions are very vivid. however. the entire story seems to be have been contrived to justify an illicit relatioship! Robert comes out a real sucker in the end! not only does he have to condone his wife's infidelity, he has to learn to put up with an illegitimate child as well! and bumping off tom is a very convenient ploy regularly employed by script writers in Hindi films! get rid of the extra male (or female, as the case may be) so that everything can be nicely rounded off in the end! i'm afraid it is a rather stale theme in my part of the world. i'd recommend this book for any one interested in psychology, but just about that!"
2,Worse than a Harlequin romance,"It started out so well; the story seemed destined to explore the nature of healing with an intriguing link to the almost magical world of the ""horse whisperers."" It quickly degenerated into a third-rate romance. The ending is too pitiful for comment. The movie version actually fixes most of the problems with the book, so watch it instead."
3,WAY too long,"I enjoyed the movie several years ago when it was in the theater, and thought I'd get the book on tape. Not sure what the abridged version is like - but the unabridged was simply full of boring detail. I do like the story, the descriptions of the countryside, the horses, and the love story are all very good -- but I wish Evans would spare some of the detail! What was said in 9 tapes could have easily been cut down to 7 or 8."
4,I Liked it!,"This is the kind of book one would like to read on a winter's eve! Full of life, intrigue, love, romance, and on the darker side, infidelity. A super and surprising ending.....one that you won't appreciate till you get there! If you saw the movie, it is NOT THE SAME!Recommended for the sheer joy of being transported to the lives of fictitious people over whom you have no control! Enjoy the ride without responsibility! :)"
1,All hype and no substance...,"This book seems to be another attempt at creating a magical realism novel, like The Bridges of Madison County--a lone man with mystical powers, one failed marriage and ta da...who finds the ONE woman for all time--only she is trapped in a marriage she is bored or unhappy with. They have a brief affair and then he walks out, never to be seen again. I couldn't relate to the characters very well. They seemed made of cardboard. In my opinion this book meets the standard for pop literature, not high literature. If it's high-quality magical realism with great love scenes and scary situations you want, I strongly suggest Gabriel Garcia Marquez's books. That's one person who knows how to write in this genre!"
1,Didn't finish it,"I was intrigued by the legend of horse whisperers, but found this book unbelievable. For one, the book starts off in the viewpoint of a truck driver, who, other than being responsible for the accident, played no real part in the story by the time I quit reading. Also, a good friend of mine is an amputee who lost her leg right after eighth grade, and I spent a lot of time with her after the accident. Believe me, she wasn't up on crutches very quickly at all. Granted, I tried to read the Reader's Digest condensed version, so they may have had to cut a lot of scenes, but the girl's seemingly short recovery time just didn't feel realistic. Not only that, but I didn't like her mother--she was not a sympathetic character to me, so I never got as far as Montana. Therefore, I can't say what I thought of the character the book was named after"
2,YUK!,"Two people close to me (but not anymore) highly recommeded this book and, therefore, I was anxious to read it. It never got any better after the truck accident. I read the whole book (what a waste of time) just to see if it was going to get better and it never did. I'm glad to read the other review articles here to see I'm not the only one who was disappointed"
2,This book was a dismal disappointment.,"After hearing all the reviews, I was thrilled when I received this book as a Christmas present. The beginning was suspensful and made me anxious to continue reading. However, after Grace and Annie arrived at the Booker's, the story starts to go downhill. Where are the details and secrets of the art of horse whispering? It's as though it was too much trouble to do any detailed research into this unknown art. The ending of the book seems like the author was in a hurry to wrap the package and get it to the post office in any condition just so he'd be on time with his delivery. The way he chose to end the book did nothing to enhance the storyline. Very disappointing"
2,Very Disappointed!,"Very Disappointed, I can't believe that Mr. Evans develop such a story. The starting of the story is wonderful with great description of the characters and the environment of Montana. But what has to do with love, Doesn't he know that Annie has already been married. I consider thats a kind of adultory. And thats very sick too. What going on with his mind. I hope this is not going to happen in his next novel. And think he should go and check his concept of love and understand what in mean"
1,Ugh!,"The cover of this book should show a busty woman and a hunk of a man sitting on horses but locked in a passionate embrace. The synopsis of this book makes it sound like a great story; the truth is that it is nothing more than a dime-store romance. What is this with best-sellers about guys who are just too much for married women to resist? Must be some ego on these authors, who obviously knowing little about true love. (if they insist on writing about romance). I would appreciate it if the synopsis of these books makes it clear that the book is a romance. It is akin to making a porno movie with a plot (no, no I don't mean that it is all about sex, I am just saying that the story exists only to serve the romance, not the other way around"
3,Half and half!,"It is interesting that about half the reviews I read were one thing, and the other half the other. My thoughts echo one group. At the risk of dull repeat, the beginning was great, although it distrubed me more than fiction usually does, and a little past the halfway mark I considered stopping, but I have a problem stopping before the end of a book I'm reading, no matter what the reason. The ending is atrocious. How could someone who can start out writing so well come up with such a horrific, out of character ending. Tom Booker would never, ever do that! And Grace would have been finished off if he had. Why the abrupt ridiculous ending, Mr. Evans? Did you get tired of it, or was your deadline truly upon you? It would be lovely if you could rewrite at least the last quarter of the book. I know you could do much better than that. It was the concept, the title and the cover that drew me to it as well, but that much trauma gave me bad dreams after finishing it"
2,Terrible,"I really thought it was terrible. When I bought this book, it actually sounded good. I don't know what I was thinking...but I never judge a book by it's cover. At the end of the reading, I just felt, like, ...how many more old romance stories must be told repetively over and over? Bluntly put, I don't see how this book is very different from any of those trash books that any english teacher would abhor. So basically, to sum it up what I didn't like was the same scenario: bored ambitious career woman in the Eastcoast somehow decides that because her life with her husband isn't fulfilling she goes and have an affair with some ranch hand guy who psychologically treats horses. BORING. I actually didn't like the heroine character very much either--she was too 2-D-ish. the book scared me too much to wanna see the movie. So I didn't. But somehow I ended up with the The Horse Whisperer Cd....and it's actually pretty good. =)"
1,A waste of time,"I picked up this book due to curiosity. The fact that it was on the bestseller's list for several months along with a seemingly interesting plot compelled me to read it. I regret wasting any amount of time on this poor excuse for a novel. The book had the schmaltzy dialogue that one would find in a cheap romance novel. What could have made for interesting drama (ie., the plight of young Grace) was overshadowed by an affair between the two main characters that lacked both credibility and appeal. There are plenty of well-written books out there that accomplish the drama that Evans could only hope to achieve (Isabelle Allende, Toni Morrison, etc.). Give it up Evans!"
2,Message not clear,"Being a horse owner myself, reading the book was a must as well as seeing the movie. I preferred the book though to the movie.I just re-read the book many years later and for some reason I do not remember the affair. I am now older and wiser and have to say the book was very disturbing and the message very immoral. Also, the ending was way too tidy. The interaction between horse and human is memorable though.This book is not intended for the typical young, horse-loving girl."
3,"well done, but...","I thought the book was very well done, some nice touches, some unexpected layers. But two things just don't ring true, small, but annoying: first, the Jewish ex-wife. I don't see Tom's character as having any attraction at all to ... Rachel was it? Nor would she to him. I don't see them even looking at each other and how Evans describes their relationship only seconds that. To me it smells of a first-time author trying to maximize his chances of getting published. Second, Tom's funeral, how hundreds came. Doesn't ring true for a couple of reasons; first, it doesn't seem plausible he would have come in contact with that many people (that many Annies) to have established such great relationships that they would have made such an effort to attend his funeral. (The many people who attended his clinics would not have gone.) And also, how would they have heard about his death in time for them to attend his funeral? He was heroic enough, I felt, without the church overflowing."
2,ummmmm,"I bought this book looking for , well horse stuff. I am horse crazy and I wanted a horse book. I bought it because I remembered fragments of the movie from when i watched years ago. I remembered the horsey parts. There is alot of adult stuff in this book and hardly any horse stuff. I would recemed this too a person who likes romance novels and if you are horse crazy don't even bother."
1,Soppy Mills & Boone,"It is not by any means the worst book I have read.However, it must be near that.I wish I had saved my money and my time.This is in the nature of a warning to others, so that they may profit from my foolishness of having purchased and read this utterly stupid, silly, maudlin, shallow, vacuous book."
1,"A bland, poorly written book, mediocre and dull at it's best","I was very, very underwhelmed after having trudged my way through this book. The story is told in a flat and unremarkable way, the characters are unlikable and one dimensional, the plot is unrealistic-it is a story that lacks both imagination, believability, and foundation. The ending felt like a cop out. This book reads like it was written for a third grader. The publisher of this book should feel like a sucker for paying Mr. Evans such an enormous sum for such Drivel; I know I feel like a sucker for buying it and actually reading it. The only reason I didn't toss it after the first two chapters, was because I was in total disbelief that such a hyped book could actually be so awful. I felt it HAD to get better somewhere. The joke was on me."
2,Disappointing,"The best part of the book was the beginning. I thought as I began reading, ""This is going to be a good one!"". However what I thought was going to be the tragedy of a spirted horse saved only by the undying love of a young girl, became a love story between a horse trainer, the whisperer, and the girl's mother. What a waste?! I am looking forward to reading, ""The Man Who Listens to Horses"" for a better read about the communication between ""man and animal"". It is based on the idea of a ""horse whisperer"" not a wife-stealing, son-dumping man who happens to be good with horses."
2,This book was truly a tragedy in the Shakesperian sense.,"The characters intrigued me immediately when I began reading this book. By the time they got to Montana I lost my interest in everyone but Tom, but I found him pretty shallow. Why didn't we hear about the truck driver again? We knew a lot about him in the beginning. Why didn't the father fight harder for his family? How did he suddenly become so career driven once his wife and child left? Why didn't Tom ever see his son? He seemed to have traveled extensively. I enjoyed the author's descriptions. I wanted to know these people more. The ending was pitiful."
3,Glad I didn't buy it,"I give this novel a 5 because it did hold my interest, but the characterizations were weak and the ending seemed hurried and contrived. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless they are stranded due to a blizzard or just seriously bored. I am curious to see what Redford will do with this; some great cinematography just might do the trick."
1,Poorly written trash sells big---quel drag,"I found this book when I was desperate for a read--what a disappointment! Cardboard characterizations, actually I take that back as the descriptions on the back of cereal boxes have oft proved more gripping, and how about that ending. If it isn't completely amateurish to kill off a character to resolve a plot snarl then the best of novels start off with, ""It was a dark and stormy night."" Spend your pennies on a better book. The only beauty in this one is found in the title which is too bad as I'm sure many were drawn to it solely on that basis."
5,The most moving book I've read all year.,"The Horse Whisperer is a story of love and trust, of forgiving and rebirth. The characters and their actions are so real, people cannot help but to identify with them. Even if no one has gone through the same trials and tribulations, it is easy to understand why someone would make the same choices. The book is full of raw emotions that alternately tear at your heart and cause you to laugh. This is a must read for anyone who has ever faced a tough decision or a difficult challenge."
4,"A Good Fast Read, Predictable but Still Enjoyable","I had already seen the movie when I read this book. For those who haven't seen/read one or the other, I'll simply say - do both. They're two different takes on the same story; who says you can't like both versions? Neither is high intellectual fare; they're just entertainment. And sometimes entertainment is what it's all about.As to the beauty of Montana - I live in Colorado, and if you've never seen the Rockies for yourself, both the book and the movie will do their best to entice you here; do yourself a favor - let them!"
3,"It was a beautiful, well-written family drama.","It's so complex! It has so many different components; woman seeking independence, father feeling abandoned, and a daughter seeking her health. Beautiful, vivid scenery in the way he described the rugged beauty of Montana."
2,Great for awhile....,"I found THE HORSE WHISPERER very easy to get into. Flowed smoothly, good character development, believeable romance until the end. After all of the buildup of Tom Booker's horsemanship skills, there was no way that the events in the last few pages of the book could happen. The movie was better than the book. On a positive note, the book left me more intrigued with Montana."
4,A sweeping tale of passion and gradeur.,"It did not take me long to complete Nicholas Evans' lush novel, ""The Horse Whisperer"". All of the accolades that it had received were true. It was compelling how the novel grabbed hold of you and kept you reading until you literally found yourself at the end of its absorbing tale. Evans created characters that were rich with life and the setting held a beautifully vivid gradeur. To witness the progress of the three tainted souls was a pleasure and an unforgettable experience. I found myself hoping for a quick and easy recovery for the physically and emotionally traumatized characters. Yet, I discovered myself accepting and enjoying the detailed unfolding and later regrowth of each of the characters. Hence, ""The Horse Whisperer"" was indeed a delightful novel to have read over the beginning of my Christmas holidays. I am now eagerly anticipating to read the next book by Nicholas Evans."
3,This is a wonderful book with a terribly unoriginal ending.,This book deserves all its numerous accolades until the reader reaches the last ten or so pages and then the novel is pure garbage. Tom Booker is a noble man who would never let a horse stomp him to death just because he couldn't have a very selfish woman for himself. The horse should have killed the woman and Tom could then have married the horse!
1,Soap opera drivel masquerading as literature,"The worst aspect of this book is the fact that it tries to be something it is not - quality fiction. The beginning shows possibility in the tragic horse accident involving two young girls, one of them Annie's daughter. Instead of exploring the ramifications of this incident, however, the author uses the tragedy to set an unconvincing love story into action. I could have skipped the nauseating stolen glances between frosty Annie and wooden Tom. Maybe if these characters had actually had a chance to develop I would have cared more - although, I doubt it. I was given the impression that this novel was well-written and of high quality. I am astounded that Robert Redford was able to make a semi-successful motion picture out of this nonsense(of course, I use the term ""success"" loosely). I would have sooner pegged it for movie-of-the-week material."
2,Nice yarn but klutzy prose and questionable ideology.,"The narrative -- basically a girl on horse getting into an accident and then only recovering with the help of a Montana horseman -- virtually collapses under the weight of the author's infatuation with baroque adjectives. This is a mixture of feelings, blood and tears, the occasional soft porn thrown in for good measure, eventually sending the message that the earthy plain Montana ranchers (incidentally blue-eyed and blond Aryan heroes) are morally far superior to slick city folk. Most of the time, the suspense holds, so in a way it's fun reading, but the stereotyping is almost harder to bear than the indulgence in real estate selling adjectives. Go, read some Hemingway, before writing another epic!"
2,Unrealistic tripe,"This story starts out dramatically and then drags the reader through one unbelievable event after another. As with many Grisham novels, the reader must suspend all sense of common sense and logic to accept the sensationalistic plot. I would ask the readers who loved this book to rethink the events and ask themselves whether the characters and events are believable. When I read a novel, I don't want to stop in the middle and ask, ""Why in the world would anyone do that?"" Characters are quirky and unidimensional, plot is trite, don't waste your time."
4,Horse Whisperer,The book is great. It tells about a girl who had been injured and a horse who is severly cut up and how they come together again. The girl learns to ride again and the horse starts trusting people again.
2,"Saw the movie, could not get through the book","I really liked the movie and wanted to learn more about the inner lives of the characters. The movie also cut out all the sex in the book. I was disppointed and disgusted with the book since, the beautiful story of wounded girl and her horse and the people who loved them enough to not let them go, was marred by awful, graphic sex scenes and loose sexual morals. If I wanted to read about someone's personal sex life, I would read the proper material for that. The sex was very unnecessary. However, Mr. Evans writes beautiful descriptions of the human heart and the natural landscape."
1,terrible,"Mr.Evans could have made it so much better.I am a horse lover + rider, so I know how they act and their reactions to certain things. As I read this book, it did not sound like Mr.evans knew that much about horses. The beginning was good but I started to fall apart from there. I'm sure it would have been a better book if he had had more knowledge about horses. When I first started reading it, I thought the whole book was going to be based on horses. Then, horses were basically taken out of the picture and it was all love. Not very good, and I think that Pilgrim would deffinetly not have been that aggresive after the accident. His body got hurt, his brain was just fine."
3,"Great story marred by absurd Greek tragedy, but read anyway!","This talented author, who spins a wonderful tale of love, endurance, patience and forgiveness, suddenly goes schizoid at the end. Or else he chose a lazy, farfetched ""solution"" to a love triangle. There's no way a man of Tom Booker's kindness and humanity would have performed such a pointless sacrifice. (Especially after Evans emphasized repeatedly that there was nothing wrong with Tom and Annie having an affair. What did he say - something like, ""If this was wrong, what on earth was right?"") Grace had already been through a horrific ordeal as a result of a horse accident. Due in large measure to Tom's influence and teachings, she had recovered. There's simply no way he would have put her through another trauma. The movie ending is far more credible. Yet, despite its ""Greek tragedy"" ending, this book has a lot to offer. Just see the movie afterward."
2,Don't read this book if you don't like romance...,"I chose a 3 because the beginning was great. I thought it was going to be about a horse that's spirt was broken by a horrible accident, and they were going to put it back together. Well, i was right but from the 450 pages, only about 75 of them were about the horse. I read it because i love horses, but this wasn't about horses."
2,"Bought it, read it, hated it.","I have heard that Mr. Evans can write a great screen-play. If so, maybe he should go back to that line of work. This is a book that starts out like a ball of fire, and is quickly extinguished by mid-way. The end in particular left me cold.I have also heard a rumor...nothing more than that, mind...that this was actually written for the express purpose of making a movie from it. That Mr. Evans was asked to write this drivel so that Hollywood could make a movie from a bestseller. If this is true, then just wait for the movie...the book isn't work the money."
1,"Before you buy, read all these reviews first!!!","I can't believe I bought a hardback copy. I won't rehash what so many have stated so eloquently, but will add that I got absorbed until the half way point, and read on hoping for the unexpected to happen, but threw the book into the dumpster when the big affair became imminent. What a disappointing waste of time for readers. I too read on was expecting a deeper, soul searching, or introspective journey, but alas, it was not to be. If you must, borrow a copy - or check it out of my trash can - just don't expect me to be interested in how it turns out"
2,"IT DOESNT WHISPER, IT CROAKS!!","This book travels very, very well until the plot (ostensibly) gets to Montana, then suddenly the reader is in bodice-ripping country ie Madision County. The horse whispering theme is hardly explored and is insufficiently developed to justify the idea that Tom heals both horses and their mistresses (young ones and older ones). Based solely on the opening chapters, Evans must have something better to contribute than this embarrassment"
3,"A man who heals horses also has a talent, can help people to","I thought that it was a pretty good book. It kept me hooked and I didn't want to put it down. It showed that horses have feelings and a mind too. I am twelve years old, so I thought that the sexual areas were a little much. I didn't know that that would be a part of the book when I got it. I liked that everything was not perfect when the book ended. That isn't realistic. I think that it was worth the read."
1,He's No Roy Rogers!,"Tom Booker is the most loathsome excuse for a hero ever to ride out of the American west. His self-indulgence and irresponsibility loom over his horsemanship like the mountains of Montana loom over his Double D Ranch. As my wife said, ""Remember the movie Cabin Boy? It was a better story."""
1,"Disappointing, to say the least.","I was all excited - a horse book for adults! Well, the story of the girl and the horse was ok, but, honestly! The rest of the story was just stupid. Do we really need such tripe in a book? If you're going to read it, see the movie. It's much more interesting, which is something I rarely say."
1,Cliched romantic garbage totally lacking in imagination.,"This book starts out promisingly and, at least for about 170 pages (paperback), it seems like it's going to be the story of three people -- a mother, father, and their injured daughter -- and an injured horse (and what's done to save him). That alone would have been enough to make a good book, but, of course, the author went for the movie deal and tied in a romance -- cliched, of course, between the mother and a cowboy who's written to look like Robert Redford -- that's a copy of The Bridges of Madison County. If only he had just stuck to the girl and the horse ... What a ripoff! They could at least package this as a romance novel, then I would've known not to buy it. Instead, I feel as if somebody snuck into my wallet and pulled out $7.99."
1,I hope the movie is better than the book!,"This book is terrible! I don't know how it climbed to the top of the best-seller list. I felt no compassion for either the human or equine characters. They both are as flat as cardboard! I hated the story and only hoped it would end quickly to put me out of my misery. Since the story reads more like a screenplay than a novel, I'd suggest that the author stick to writing films and leave the writing of novels to others."
2,"Good start, but predictible and sappy story line","What starts off as an upsetting yet attention-grabbing book ends up being nothing more than a syrupy love story. When yuppie career-driven mom falls for the the quiet rugged cowboy, I was reminded of every girl-meets-boy-girl-gets-boy story. The fact that she's married is a mere inconvenience as she plots to leave her husband. Rubbish! A woman of her fiber would never succumb to such emotion---she's unable to demonstrate love to her own child! Yawn...."
2,Where's the horse?,"After all the hype I thought this book would be a profound insight into the relationships between people and animals and other people. How disappointed I was when I got almost all the way through and discovered it was little more than a romance novel! Heaving bosoms and all...I suppose without any hype I might call it an impressive first novel, but I found most of the relationships stereotypical and the ending totally inconsistent with what little character development there was."
1,Puerile and pernicious!,"This book is fundamentally disappointing for two reasons. First, imagine a story where a husband with a loving wife and recently crippled child suddenly falls for his kid's physical therapist. He's finally found his one true soul mate. How moving right? Wrong -- he's a self-centered cad (particularly if the therapist is half his wife's age). So why aren't stories like this and Bridges of Madison County treated the same? Secondly and more importantly, the Horse Whisperer treats the crippled kid like some sort of stage prop in the narcistic mom's adolescent fantasy. Its implies that life's real meaning doesn't spring from parenthood and marriage (or any of the ordinary relationships in life) but only from finding a down home hunk in a cowboy hat who talks to horses. Ugh."
2,Not much to like,"I started reading this book only knowing that it involved a mystical sort of man who could communicate with horses. This concept sounded intriguing. The novel turns out to be more about the thoroughly unlikable Annie character. She is is a self-centered woman, who makes one grand gesture to help her daughter by visiting the Horse Whisperer. It is obvious from the start that there will be a romance, but I could see no reason why Tom (the title character) should have any interest in Annie. It makes you feel sorry for Annie's husband, who seems like a nice enough guy, but is left behind in New York. The horse is really the most interesting character, but he just falls into the background as the story moves on.The wild horses in the story could have been an interesting metaphor, but Evans has an annoying habit of using symbolism and then explaining it too. It is as if he thinks his readers are too stupid to figure it out on their own."
2,Black Beauty on a psychiatrist's couch. Pluuuueeese!,"Not since Black Beauty or National Velvet has a book been aimed so unashamedly at both a teen and family animal-loving audience - which is what no doubt led to its bestellerdom. But if you're going all out to pluck heart-strings, then pluck them strongly. Evans never really plumbed any strong emotions throughout. And the part where they head off across America with the horse, stopping off at the occasional symbolic monument, was hopelessly contrived. With British authors writing about America, it is so often feared that they won't catch the tone right or will lack depth. In these scenes, Evans drags everything to its most superficial level - the American experience becomes little more than a sightseeing trip. In the end, these were the only parts to bring me to tears, I was laughing so hard!"
3,horse book,I'm in the middle of the horse whisperer.i love it so far.it's a great book that even my teacher wants to read it after me.the good thing about this book is that it's a cheap book.pick up a copy of the horse whisperer while you can .
1,predictable and boring,"I read this book last summer, on the insistence of my mother and several friends. They thought it was wonderful, and I was nothing but disappointed. I found the book extremely predictable, and felt there was no depth to any of the characters. We all love books that we don't want to put down--I just wanted to get through this one because I don't like to start something and not finish it. Mr. Evans should stick to screenplays and describing the countryside of England--he did not conjure up in my mind any of Montana's beauty."
1,"Evans' first book shows only a ""whisper"" of talent","The entire time I spent reading the Horse Whisperer, something seemed wrong, sort of unpolished, about the book. ""It reads like a screenplay,"" I thought to myself. Imagine my lack of surprise when I read about Nicholas Evans on the book's back flap -- he is a writer of screenplays and this is his first stab at writing a novel. I found his writing terribly uninspired, predictable and trite. It's sole purpose seemed to be to spawn a similarly uninspired movie.If you enjoy reading the work of truly gifted writers, keep shopping."
5,"Best horse, cowboy, & city girl story I've ever read!!","My name is Ashley & I'm 15...I went to see this movie with my mom when it first came out, because we both loved horses & Robert Redford!! I decided to read the book for an english book report...The book was way better than the movie, even if I knew what was going to happen because I had already seen the movie...I cried harder with the book, because I was able to use my own character images instead of the movie stars. In my opinion it's a great book for ages 13-however old because it also deals with a young girl losing a leg, and a mother & daughter relationship. Which by the way brought my mother & I closer together. It's a great book, and I would read the book before I see the movie...have your own experience before Hoolywood gives you there's. Thank You Nicholas Evans!!!"
2,Please spend some money on a good editor!,"I finished the book, which I believe is a tribute to my own desire for completion, not to the writer. Why did the author take so long to say so little? I thought no one was paid by the word anymore. I actually found myself skimming for interesting passages to read - a rarity for me, I assure you. The story does hold together somehow, though, and you do want to know how it ends. But then, I want to know how ""The Brady Bunch"" episodes end, too. Sorry. Another unusual thought: I bet the movie is better."
2,Promising story turned lackluster,"I was attracted to this story as I am both a lover of horses and the mountains of the American West. I knew the book had very mixed reviews, but decided to give it a try anyway. While Evans did a great job of setting up the story it never quite takes off and engages the reader. The ending was simplistic and not in line with the characters. Not a book I'd re-read."
5,It was great.,"I just finished reading, ""The Horse Whisperer"", and it was a great book! The author detailed every event and explained their emotions, but it did not drag on! Perfect for a teenager and up!"
2,Too Convenient . . .,"I had heard such great things about this book that I couldn't pass up the chance to read it for myself---Am I glad that I borrowed it instead of buying it. I was impressed at the begining, but by the middle, I was bored. I could tell already that she was going to have an affair with some steamy love scenes, but if I wanted a tragic love story and sex, I would have read a trashy romance. I did like Gracie's story though. However, the ending of Annie's and Tom's was way too convenient! She didn't have to make any of her own decisions and didn't suffer the consequences of breaking her promises to her husband. She got off too easy. If you want to read this novel, go to a library---It won't cost you."
3,Great book until the end!,"I would give The Horse Wisperer a 10 if the last two chapters are rewritten. I loved every minute, every word until then. I hope Redford changes the ending in the movie or it too will be ruined. It would have been better if the reader had been left wondering. Instead I was left with a strong dislike for every character except Tom. Why did Evans ruin such a moving, beautifully written book with this stupid ending?"
4,Worth the time,"A great, engaging, easy read. A moving story that will probably hold your interest even if you, like I, are not even that into horses. The ending is way too neat and tidy though, somewhat too convenient and thus artificial. But other than that it was a good book and a great expenditure of reading time. I hear the movie isn't bad either."
4,Mixed emotions,"This book gave me mixed emotions. For starters I felt that the author should have focused more on the horse whispering part and a little less on the romance. A little romance is O.K. but the author went a little far I felt. The fact that I love horses might be partial to my decision, but I still feel that all the romance was a little too much."
3,The Horse Whisperer,"I don't know how a book could draw me in, while turning me away. I found myself feeling conflicted by this book. On one hand, the story of the daughter, who has faced a life altering trauma, was very interesting and moving. On the other hand, the story surrounding the mother, nearly turned me from the book. The story was aiming for realism, but sometimes missed the target."
3,"The ""horny"" Horse Whisperer","I bought this book AFTER I saw the movie. I had no idea that the book existed. I saw the movie shortly after it came out and about a year later i saw the book in a local bookstore, so i picked it up. Ususally, I'm with the majority when it comes to the old saying ""the book is better"". However there is an exception to every rule, right? This book was the exception. It started off wonderfully but about halfway through turned into a sickening romance novel. I love horses and i wished that the book would have focused more on them. As another reviewer mentioned this book went ""Soft-core Porn"" about halfway through. When i picked up this book, i was about 13 or 14. I wasnt into reading about people having sex, i was interested in HORSES! On top of that the ending to the book SUCKED... movie was much better."
3,Read about the REAL horse whisper,"His name is Monty Roberts. He is not a mythical person or fiction. A truely wonderful store about a boy who learns how to communicate with horse in their own language. The book is available at Amazon as ""The Man Who Listens To Horses"" by Monty Roberts. This real life story is much better than the fiction book or movie."
1,'0' stars - Waste of Time & Mind,"I can honestly say, this is the worst book I have ever read. Not only is the writing flowery and annoying, the ""put all genres into the story"" reads more like a spoof Saturday Night Live piece, except this story isn't humorous, only laughable (if Evans was writing it today, he would have added some CSI blood and forensics to boot). Whoops, I am sorry, I don't recall any shooting guns; only the colors of Annie's various dresses (that list comes after her self-gratification, but basically around the time of her selfless act on her husband). I stuck it out till the end, which made me equally upset at myself as I was at Evans and everyone under the influence who rated this higher than a ONE. I can't summarize it any better than another reviewer, who states ""The fact that this many people actually liked it says something about our morality as well as our literary sense."""
4,The proper ingredients for a good book-I liked it!,"Very enjoyable book. Thoughtful, yet well paced. It kept my interest and had the proper ingredients; a little romance mixed in for good measure. The relationship to the horses was well drawn. Did not have the ending I would have chosen, but it is worth reading"
2,Exceptionally rich British screenwriter hits Big!,"The publicity department simply forgot to tell readers that the ""first novelist"" is British, an acclaimed screenwriter, and a savvy fellow. He spent three months in Montana and made ten million dollars for this puffed-up romance. For as much as he made, he could at least have gotten the details of horsemanship and Montana life right. Since he is so very rich now, may he never pull this rabbit trick again"
4,"A touching, but devastating book to finish.","The Horse Whisperer in many ways trys to shock the reader in it's graphic details. It hooks the reader by the firstchapter, and tricks you into believing this to be a story of hope. I recomend this for a good read but don't get emotionally attached.The story of the mother and daughter had some real moments"
5,God is surely smiling!,"Of all the inspirational music I have heard over the years, Carpenter's helper is, by far, the most stirring and at the same time calming, prayers of joy and love and faith that I have ever had the pleasure of hearing.I am buying this copy to give as a very special gift for a dear friend. I can think of no better present as it will continue to give such pleasure over and over again!"
1,Does not work,"I purchased this item and used it as directed in my lawn. My 2 dogs, did not care at all about it, they still pee and poop in the lawn without caring about this product. What a waste of money $10 for nothing, pretty expensive in the first place."
1,Scam!! This product doesn't work at all.,"This product is a scam. I applied the product exactly they way it instructed me to, and even exaggerated in the quantity. The following two days, dogs were doing their thing as usual."
3,let's burn!,"I actually picked this earlier effort up after reading Coffee Stains, August's other piece of work. this is a bit younger, the Man in Black attempting to be all 'Zounds and Wowie!' and at the same time, deep and dark and all that rigamarole. The metaphors about cats really reached out to me."
5,One of the Best Country Groups,They are my favorite country group. I enjoy almost every song they ever did. They sing very well together and they are real easy to listen to.
4,A light chinwag,"Seal follows his opening quote ""Think with the wise but talk with the vulgar"". I found this book magnetic. I picked it up because it was relevant to my univesity degree, but it's content is also personally interesting and entertaining. This book is not for those who prefer their literature sanitised. Seal lists in detail Australianisms that underlie modern folklore, and swearing, profanity and a healthy disdain for authority are basic to that lore. Australian language is shown here to be so much more than English."
4,Nice bench,"I bought this to use as a bench at my weaving looms. It's much more comfortable than the office chair and wooden bench that I had been using. I wish it were a little easier to adjust, rather than basically taking it apart when I adjust the height."
3,Started out nice,"Generally nice design. Exterior mesh pockets do not hold my water bottle. After 7 months, the front-side pocket ripped at the seam."
2,not again,"The item arrived on time and was immediately installed. However, it did not preform as advertised. It was said to replace a conventional brake light but was nowhere near as bright."
2,Definitely not musical royalty,"Like many other people that are already well known for other things, a singing career was not a wise choice for Princess Stephanie of Monaco. Not outright disgusting, but pretty boring for someone that's actual royalty, and in one song she reveals her smoking habit in a ""Look at me! I'm cool because I smoke!"" kind of way. If you like white-chick pop from the early 90s, try Kylie Minogue, Cathy Dennis, Amy Grant, or Lisa Stansfield instead."
5,HP Photosmart R817 Digital Camera Battery,"The battery arrived on time, was less expensive than previous replacement batteries for my camera, charged readily and has just returned from an international trip where it did what was asked of it."
4,"Very Un-Rozz like, but still very good.","I was surprised when I picked up this album. I've heard Christian Death before, but it sounded nothing like this. Rozz and Gitane (Both Christian Death members) created a side project, combining piano, accordians, and synthesizer in a moody blend of very dark and personal music. This album reveals a subdued and personal version of Williams, a side I'd never hope to see. Very good. I'd recommend this album to Rozz's fans, or even fans of folk music or bands like Black Heart Procession or The Cure."
1,dull and uninspired,"This album sounds like it was thrown together in a few days. The previous commentary comparing this to Catastrophe Ballet is absurd. This album is worse than even Valor's recent albums: Sexy Death God, the terrible album that it is, is better than Dream Home Heartache. I have experienced the pain of Rozz Williams -- in my wallet!"
5,Celebrations: RItuals of Peace and Prayer,book arrived on timebook priced very competitivelyBook arrived in the condition as advertisedBook used for gift and was read and enjoyed previouslyMaya Angelou is an exceptionally wonderful author
1,"Read Hilton Als' ""New Yorker"" profile","Read Hilton Als' ""New Yorker"" profile of Angelou for a true glimpse."
2,Sloppy fact-checking & proofreading. What's true?What isn't?,"While the book's premise is excellent and the use of eye-witness accounts laudable, the numerous typos, inconsistencies and errors make one feel unable to trust the information presented. (On page 9, we ""learn"" that the battle of Vitoria occurred in 1815!) The typos are truly jolting: ""filed"" for field; ""Moor"" for Moore; ""form"" for from, ""Sit"" for Sir. And that's just in the first three pages. The author states that this is book doesn't claim to be an ""academic or definitive work,"" but it's unusual for a work on this subject (and at this price! - $35 at the bookstore) to be so poorly presented. There's good stuff in it, but who knows what's accurate and what isn't? A real disappointment."
5,Where have you been?,After years of sharpening knives and cutting fingers this little gem came into my life.....As a jerky maker it has so simplified the task and produced a much more professional product........This is such a good looking unit and doesn't take up all that much space that it found a permanent location on my counter.....An absolute must have....Just order some food quality lubricant to keep it lubed because the lube washes off during clean up....Search for food quality lube from Amazon......
4,Workable,"This replaced a Krups unit which was hard to clean. There are fewer crevices which require the use of a toothpick or knife tip to remove the food particles. As the bulk of the slicing object (meat, cheese) gets smaller, it tends to hang up at the bottom of the blade and shred. This was true for the Krups as well. The collecting tray looks nice, but positioning it properly to catch the slices can be a guess at best, and it will move out of position at the slightest disturbance. It ought to be able to snap into place and perhaps be on a swivel to move in or out of place. Best way I found to collect the slices was by hand, like some people do behind a deli counter. The vari-tilt, though possibly helpful, neither makes nor breaks the deal."
5,Chef's Choice is now My Choice.,I received my Chef's Choice 632 for Christmas. I chose it because of the reviews that I saw. I was pleasently supprised that is was as good or better than what I read. I use it all the time and is works wonderful.
5,Great slicer,"The slicer works as good as the reviews describe it. I works smoothly, slices very thin, easy to clean. I like the tilt feature. I enjoy using it and happy with the purchase. I own an older, cheaper slicer that could never cut Jarlsberg cheese to uniform thickness. So I feel that it's perfect.A minor complaint after cleaning the slicer was that I had some difficulty to put back the plastic frame around the blade but once I figured it out where all the notches go, it is no problem anymore."
5,"So far, so good!","Bought this slicer for beef jerky and vegetable slicing for dehydrating. Slices through semi-frozen beef without hesitation and slices evenly. Sliced ""chipped"" some turkey ham for sandwiches - just like deli-prepared slices. Super easy to clean. Tilting mechanism takes some getting used to for locking in place. Used oven cleaner to clean off the factory lubrication since I had no idea what it was made from - followed with hot sudsy water. Doesn't take too much room on my counter. I'd buy this slicer again. Oh, used the smooth blade, not the serrated. I have no idea when/if I will ever use that blade."
1,MMM,The carriage on this slicer has openings in which food and juice can seep into but there is no way to appropriately clean it out. openings are too little to stick a finger in and it is not dishwasher safe. A total disappointment.
2,Not made for slicing uncooked beef,"I purchased this product to slice uncooked beef, for Korean bulgogi and shabu-shabu. This product does a horrible job slicing uncooked beef thinly. Instead, I got shredded beef. This is not stated on the product description and since it clearly says it is up to the job of slicing meat, you would think it can slice uncooked beef. According to Chef's Choice, there are problems with slicing uncooked beef. You are not supposed to use this machine on frozen beef as it will ruin the blade. Again, this is not stated in the product description. In addition, If you still want to buy this machine, do not purchase from Golda's Kitchen because they have a horrible return policy. They would not let me return this product because it is used, but I would not have known the slicer does not do what the description says unless I tried it."
2,Not very useful,"Skip the tilt feature, it is not useful. The slicer slices ok, but it leaves a fairly large unslicable heel on the bottom of your piece of meat. Wastes a lot. It is also very hard to clean. There has got to be a better option."
2,FAIR SLICER NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"THIS SLICER IS NOT AT ALL IMPRESSIVE AND IS OVERPRICED.IT LEAVES A LARGE PIECE OF MEATDIFFICULT TO CLEANPLASTIC GLIDE BREAKS EASILYPLASIC ARMS GETS CAUGHT IN THE SLICERPLASTIC MEAT HOLDER DOESN'T HOLD VERY WELL, I NEARLY SLICED OFF A FINGER WHEN THE MEAT GRIPS SLIPPED.ALL IN ALL, THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER SLICER FOR THE MONEY.I AM LOOKING FOR A BETTER QUALITY MODEL AND RECOMMEND YOU DO THE SAME."

3,Good review of the History of Catholic Ecumenism,"I had read the first two-thirds of this book (which cover the Catholic-Orthodox and Catholic-Lutheran dialogues) a long time ago and have finally finished the final section (the Catholic-Anglican dialogue) and the appendix (on the notion of ""Sister Churches"" as used in the Catholic-Orthodox dialogue). The book provides a thorough and academic look at this issues with a clear bias towards the Catholic Church (the author is a Franciscan!). Since it was published in 2004, it's not fully up-to-date on ecumenical dialogues but does give a great deal of background and context. If that's what you are looking for, this book is a great resource."
3,Violet Toilet Wood Seat,"The condition of this toilet seat is excellent. However, the brackets attached to the seat and lid are another color. In fact, the brackets match the toilet color, but the lid and seat do not match."
2,Delivery took too long,"The hose is on my desk, since the project it was for had a deadline. The other parts arrived and worked well, but I ended up buying an expensive alternative. The hose should work fine- but since I didn'thave it to use I can't say."
3,Must have for Space: 1889,"If you are planning to play Space: 1889, this is THE supplemental book to get. It gives much greater detail to Mercury & Venus than the rulebook, and adds to the information on Mars. The information on Victorian Earth is lacking, though the travel times and world maps of 1889 Earth are helpful.Cloud Captains provides interesting detail on Karkarham, ""the Casablanca of Mars"" - where just about anything goes. It is a great place to set a campaign for ribald adventurers."
4,Skye terrier champions 1952-1987,"This book is a list of champions and is published for the serious pedigree researcher, not for the average ""man-on-the-street"". As in almost every book, there are typos but nothing that cannot be overcome."
5,Frighteningly clever,"This was a clever one for sure. Noir writer Jim Thompson introduces us to a cast of small-town characters once again, and in his typically cynical way none of them have much redeeming going on. The surprising twist is in one of the character's behavior, so I won't give it away here. But its one of those surprises that hits you slow."
4,One of Thompson's Best,"POP. 1280 is in the tradition of other great Thompson books, such as THE KILLER INSIDE ME. The protagonist is a seemingly respectable, law-abiding citizen -- small-town Southern sheriff, Nick Corey. He's been pushed around by his wife, brother-in-law, and most other town folks. In the beginning it's clear that Corey has been a very passive sheriff, and his anger at being considered weak is building. The book chronicles how he slowly and dramatically strikes back. Corey's much smarter than most of the town thinks, but he's also probably delusional, which is what ultimately makes this book such a black comic gem. There are more laugh-out loud moments in this book than in most Thompson books. The plot depends on a number of coincidences and stretches of logic, but it's great fun and there are some truly great surprises along the way. Overall, I think it's one of Thompson's most enjoyable and funny books, with some memorable moments and characters."
2,"Very overdone, bad ending","Pop. 1280 was published 12 years after Thomspon's classic The Killer Inside Me and tells a very similar story - but not as well. Killer was a serious crime story, Pop. 1280 departs from reality to the point where the people often come across as caricatures. The ending of the book was also very disappointing; it seemed that Thompson just ran out to things to say. The two stars are for the sometimes very witty writing and the intricate manipulations that are woven into the plot."
5,what can you say about Paul Rodgers?,Fantastic....great selection of songs and you can't beat Paul Rodgers in the vocal department. Definitely worh the price. Received in good condition and in time for Christmas.
3,Just like old times,I enjoy the music and the photogragy is very good. They at least played their songs in a way we could recognise them.
3,Bad co,"The concert was very good but the crowd was unbelievably subdued! So quiet! And hardly cheering on one of their own! If it were me, I would've scrapped that concert and filmed it in the USA where the crowd would've cheered and screamed for more. Paul Rodgers is so good looking, so beefy. His voice is unbelievable. Too bad he wasted it on that unappreciated audience"
5,voice stronger than ever !,"i've been waiting for almost a month for this wembley performance in blue ray to arrive,well it was well worth the wait!.the sound quality is fantastic (dts master audio) picture is great and last but not least paul rodgers voice is still stronger than ever,by far one of the greatest rock singers of all time,for someone who is pushing sixty you could never tell. original members mick ralphs and simon kirke are back and sound great.dont wait purchase this concert. there are some songs i have'nt heard in years like gone,gone,gone /electric land /honey child / burnin sky/ seagull plus 11 more of their greatest hits STAN T."
3,I loved it but.....,They may have waited too long to do this show... Band was tired and seemed to struggle to keep the audience pumped up. They played great though. I enjoyed listening over watching.
3,Audiophile viewer,"I doubt this blu-ray as I bought the previous one which was sounded so bad as rubbish. I should not have complained as today's recordings have been so bad. Old recording engineers might have been retired but young people must learn to achieve the recording better than ever to encourage the world to get moving. But disappointed, they are.............!"
2,Come one guys this is Blu-ray!,Paul you are in my backyard in White Rock however the visuals on this Blu-ray stinkLucky to be DVD quality and that's a stretch!As a Blu-ray the visual stinks!
1,Horribly written. Writer is very knowledgeable but that seems to be part of his thesis statement---that he knows so much,"I use this book as a NON-example for my students when learning about argument and not straying from one's argument when writing. At one point the author takes the time (strays from his argument) to reference other biographies from other historians----not to continue building his argument---but only to let us know how ""unacademic"" they are.This happens over and over, and it's really distracting from the monumental importance of the Emmit Till case. That's the shame of this book. Worth reading if you can get past the guy who wrote it."
3,"Interesting subject, dry read, had some inconsistencies","This book didn't tell me much about the Till tragedy that I didn't know already by reading books more engaging to the mind, as well as the 2 recent documentaries on the case. However, it appears to me that Mr. Whitfield went out of his way to place the role that Carolyn Bryant-Donhamplayed in the barbaric murder, the way he kept insisting that she did not tell her husband about this 'uppity' teenager...apparently, Mr. Whitfield wishes to lay the blame squarely on the shoulders of a cousin of the slainyouth, and the two white racists, rather than on the former 'beauty' queenherself--where part of the blame, incidentally, rests. I can understand why Mother Mobley had nothing to do with most of these writers until she decided to collaborate with Mr. Benson just shortly before her death."
4,It was a perfect fit for a window in my shower....,I needed a rod for a window in my shower and this was a perfect fit for the vinyl bathroom curtain that was purchased.
5,Levolor Rod,"I had looked everywhere for this rod. Being handicap and recovering from surgery has been a mess. But finally Amazon was there for me again. Thank you great pricing, quick delivery and the item I wanted. What more can you ask for!"
2,"Its a white rod, nothing to special.","Good for what it is does. nothing special, really. its a plain white rod. Not much to say. It does the trick."
5,Best latin pianist ever.,In this album he tries a more relaxed mood.One of his most Bill-Evans-oid works.
4,Resonating Rhythm,"Camillo's album not only provides repeated listening pleasure, it inspires dreams in the Latin-jazz style."
3,"Cool jazz album, considering it's 20 years old.","Give Michel a break. This album is 20 years old. I just bought it. It's mostly a piano album. Michel played in Times Square in '09&'10 because his rep is so high now. Comparing this 20 year old album, made when he wasnt as refined or famous, to his recent work is not fair. All artists grow up. Is it a must have jazz album? No. Nor is it one of Camilo's best, but fans will like it.BTW, I didnt care for this version of Caribe."
3,Good Album,"Good album, I wish I could rank it higher but I'm afraid I've been spoiled - I just had the pleasure of seeing Michel Camilo and the rest of his trio perform live at Dimitriou's Jazz Alley in Seattle. He was absolutely wonderful. Five stars. However, I've noticed a strange phenomenon about jazz recordings: after seeing the artist perform live, their recordings often seem boring by comparison. Live, the performers have more energy, jam, and improvisation. The recordings though, seem overly refined and over-produced. This one is no exception."
5,AMERICAN LIGHT MUSIC CLASSICS,"This CD was purchased particulary for ""Nola"". I was very elated to find other of my favorite light classics presented with a full symphonic orchestra. A number of these had escaped my memory, what a pleasure to have them available in my music collection."
3,A little dim,"The light itself is pretty, but much dimmer than I expected. It's insufficient to light a sidewalk in the dark."
1,I CANT FEEEL AIIIT!,"SAVE THE TROUBLE AND FIND THE ORIGINAL CAN YOU FEEL IT 12"".DONT GET BURNED LIKE I DID!!!1"
4,A compelling read,"The text allows even the amateur reader of mountaineering to begin to understand the more technical aspects, and why these details are so important.Cons: the author tries to be balanced and fair, but comes off a little too interested in self pity/examination at timesOverall: stimulating account of the expedition in particular and Everest in general. Recommended!"
3,"Hot, but the flavor is lacking.","This sauce tastes like brown bread mixed with barbecue sauce and vinegar. Sorry if that doesn't sound appetizing, but thats what it is. It's hot (oh man, is it hot) but I just cant find a good food to pair it with.The sauce is so thick that it's nearly impossible to get it out of the bottle, and by the time you get it out, it comes out so fast that you're praying for the future of your [...].I have it, and I like it because its hot, but I don't use it. It's been used maybe once or twice in the past few months. I have hotter sauces that I use more frequently because they taste better.Buy it though, its the original!"
1,"Unpleasant Heat, and No Flavor","O.k., I'm going to offer a counterpoint to all the positive reviews. I did not like this hot sauce, and I like hot sauce! This may be good in chili (and I will try it there as soon as I get a chance), but it is not a general hot sauce for your eggs, soup, sandwiches, whatever.It is very thick and has the consistency of tomato paste. The heat is derived from peppers and ""pepper extracts"" (read: capsaicin).If you want flavorful heat you can use everywhere, try somewhere else. I recommend Melinda's Naga Jolokia for one."
3,not so hot,"well it tastes great but the is not enough heat, well not when i am eating it. The next day is very painful!! so use in moderation;)"
4,It was okay...,"When I first received the hot sauce I thought it would be dramatically spicy, but for my case it wasn't. I like the taste of it, but I've had spicier hot sauces before. I would recommend it for any hot sauce lovers."
3,"Hot, but not hot.","First of all, this hot sauce doesn't have any flavor. I thought it would be a bit sour, but no. Its tastes like eating a flaming fart which brings me to the point about smell...IT KILLS YOUR NOSE.Thats all I have to say, but one more thing... It burned through the cap and overflowed into the fridge. k bai"
1,Ow.,"We were at California Tortilla, and I saw this stuff. So I got some and put a few drops on a pretty big burrito, and started to eat it. Before I ate any, I got something around my eye and pushed it off, and my skin literally started to BURN. It took a good 20 minutes of dabbing for it to stop burning, but that was my fault.Then I started to eat my burrito, and was fine for a few bits. Then it suddenly hit me. My throat was actually CONSTRICTED if I stopped drinking. It took about 6 rootbeers, a bag of chips, some queso, and a granola bar to stop it from making me choking. It was awful, and it ruined a $ 6 . 50 burrito."
1,The Only One I Avoid.,"Well, I guess I'm the fly in this reviewer ointment, but Dave's is the only hotsauce that I won't buy. It has a synthetic quality to it and a flavor that is almost non-existent. This is due to its being made directly from capsaicin extract as opposed to actual peppers. It offers a nuclear level of heat that seems to be a recipe for ulcers in my opinion. According to Wikipedia, its Scoville heat (fire) index rates out 50,000 units which can be contrasted with Tobasco's 2,500 to 5,000 rating. Who needs that much heat? Not me or most human beings. This stuff is lethal. No thanks."
1,This stuff is not food.,I put 2 drops into 3 scrambled eggs and mixed it up well. I took one bite and spit it out within 5 seconds and this junk burned the heck out of me.I'm not Mr. Hot Food but I do like spicy food. This stuff may not be poison but it isn't food in my opinion. What kind of people make a dopey product like this? There is a mild warning and a caution to use a drop at a time but that warning is inadequate.It was about 10 minutes of legitimate suffering that was completely unnecessary.Don't buy this junk!
5,Beyond Hot,"Even Shakespeare did not have enough of a grasp of the English language to describe how hot this sauce it. It is mind blowing. I put a few good dashes on some BBQ I have eating. I was able to shovel in 3 healthy forkfuls into my mouth before the heat hit. Pow. I was knocked out. All I could do was grab on to the table to brace myself and breath through my mouth.I ate all the bread I could find. I wiped out every square inch of my mouth with a napkin. All in an attempt to ease the heat. It helped only a bit.After about 2 hours, I was almost back to normal.It is that hot. I would think that only 1 drop would heat up a pot of chili. DO NOT try this straight from the bottle. It won't kill you, but is will wound you. Wow."
3,call 911!,"OK, I love hot sauce and spicy food. My chili can strip paint and clean engine parts. But this stuff is ridiculous.First time I saw it, I sniffed the bottle, thought ""not bad"", then put a drop the size of a BB on my finger and tasted it. I literally couldn't get my breath, and my tongue was sort of numb for a while. About 1/2 teaspoon to a pot of chili is about right, but do NOT under any circumstances put this stuff directly on food like you would with most hot sauce."
5,This stuff is hot!,"I first bought this about 15 years ago in a spice store, and it is exactly as the name implies. If you like hot sauce, this has to be in your fridge. It may be to strong to use in a large quantity, but it really adds a kick when added to other spices. I've probably tried 2 dozen ""hot"" sauces that were purchased at a grocery store, none are close to as good, or as hot as Dave's Insanity."
5,it burns it burns,"i think i know what childbirth feels like now that i've had this sauce. it was not unbearable in my mouth but what it did to my stomach - the pain was a crampy, burning pulse that i couldn't do anything about. tums, milk, bread, nothing helped. a solid hour of complete and utter misery."
4,Great book,"I recently finished this book, and I found the material to be very good. Rick Joyner has done a very good job of pulling from history lessons that can be learned. Through divine revelation, he has brought truths to the present from the past that can benefit all Christians. Even if you're not looking for revival, you can learn from this book and be challenged to grow in your faith and walk with Jesus. I recommend this book highly."
1,"An unfortunate, idealistic oversimplification of revival","Joyner writes with an air of authority but failes to properly analyze the Welsh revival of 1904/5. In his many statements and assertions, he also fails to site references and give credit to other authors. This is unfortunate since most of the primary sources on the welsh revival are out of print and difficult to locate. His conclusions are simplistic and fail to take into account the many things that went wrong during and after the Welsh revial. Joyner excells at showing his idealism in his attempt to advance revival and in so doing paves the way for the same mistakes history records to be repeated. If you are looking for a title to read on the Welsh revival, Eifion Evans' book, ""The Welsh Revival of 1904"" published by the Evangelical Press of Wales is a must."
3,too small,This will not fit an adult head. I wouldn't even recommend it for a teenager. It does not go down over the ears. For children only. ! This is misrepresented as an adult hat but it will not fit unless you have a SMALL head. FYI since they do not disclose that. It you are buying for an adult you WILL be disappointed and wasting your money.
4,Came in good condition....,"The delivery was fine, the only complaint is that the hat would be better if it made more of a snug fit, also, if the bill could be less flimsy"
5,Awesome,"Fits perfectly, and I love it! I can wear this under a hood for it to be stylish, or wear it by itself for the functionality of a hat."
2,Really small,Bought this for my husband... i could barely get the hat over my head. Good material but it should be bought for kids... not adults.
2,Review: Tiger eye globe pendant,In the description it calls the 18 mm tigereye gemstone a sphere when it probably should be called a bead because that's what it is. There's a hole that goes all the way through it. It probably won't matter to most but it bothered me. I was expecting a solid sphere.
5,unusual gorgeous cage pendant,This item is so much more catching than the picture shows. Excellent value for money. Would make a perfect gift. If you can find additional stones for centre would be perfect as we women love to co-ordinate. Would recommend this item and seller.
2,I guess I should have read he description,"While this is a beautiful piece of jewlery and my experiences with Silver Insanity have been great - it is HUGE! I expected the ""ball"" would be the size of a marble, but it is the size of a jaw breaker. It does state the size in the description, but I guess I just didn't read it. So , I will be sending mine back."
1,An early work in a long progression .............,"Another of Dan's early releases with only glimpses of how his immense talent would one day be realized. If you own ""Inside Out"" (2004) you will never play this."
4,Artemis fowl the eternity code,"Artemis Fowl: The eternity code is taken place at fowl manor, where a evil scheme is set to play. Artemis plans to deal with a man named John Spiro. He gives him an offer about a device operated by fairy technology. Spiro snatches the device and flees to his base, The spiro needle. But before he leeves he commands his manservant, Arno Blunt to shoot Artemis' bodyguard, Butler. Now Butler life lies in Artemis' hands. But luckuly his old friend Holly Short, member of the L.E.P.(leprecon) helps Butler out by healing him and bringing him life. Now the gang is complete, and ready to take on Spiro's asociatives."
3,Evil deeds have consequences,"The Eternity Codeis the 3rd book in the series. I recommend you start reading this series at the 1st,Artemis Fowl. I have a longer review for that first novel of the series.InThe Eternity Code, Artemis realizes that his evil ways hurt those he cares about and he takes serious action. (Something bad happens.)"
4,"Artemis Fowl, book 3","Great imaginative book for my ""tween"" granddaughter. We have read the others in the series and have enjoyed them all."
5,My Favorite of the Series,"I like the technology in the book as well as the genious of Artemis in his plan to ""invade the Spiro Needle"". Good plot overall and Foaly is a great character in this book as obnoxious as ever. Mulch is annoying but funny at the same time. And Holly is very professional compared to Mulch and Juliet. I also learned about Cryogenics and it developed the character of Juliet.A very good read."
5,ARTEMIS FOWL IS DA BOMB!,"This book is about a 13-year old teenager who is a genius. His name is Artemis Fowl. It starts off when Artemis makes a ""C-Cube"". The C-Cube is a super computer that can do anything from playing a CD to downloading secret information from satellites all over the world to talking on the phone. Artemis' plan is to meet with Jon Spiro, a powerful leader of one of the world's biggest cell phone companies. When Spiro see's Artemis' great piece of technology, he wants it all for himself. Throughout the rest of the book Artemis and his fairy friend, Holly, are on a quest to get the C-Cube back from Jon Spiro's high security vault.I liked this book a lot. I loved how Artemis is a genius and always had a plan that never failed. In this book, just when you think that Artemis has failed, and his plan was faulty, Artemis' scheme comes to the final stage..."
3,MAG,"this is a kid of book that you pick up and can't stop reading until the end of it.This is ecellent for all ages. It is the third book in the serise and it starts off with the young artimas fowl, the hero of the book,waiting to make a buissness deal with a rich and powerful buisiness man named Jon Spiro. Things start to go wrong and artimas is ambushed. I can't give away any more without reveaing most of the book's twists and turns."
5,Artemis is at the top of his game,"With eager hands I picked up the third installment of the Artemis Fowl series. The second book paved the way for the Fowl family to potentially follow the straight and narrow path. Before such a thing occurs Artemis has one more brilliant business plan up his sleeve that utilizes some fairy technology that had been 'borrowed'. During this business meeting the reader gets a glimpse at the child genius' naivete and need for adult guides.In this third installment you'll meet familiar faces, (keep an eye out for Grub and his wicked hangnail)and once again be astounded by young Artemis penchant for intrigue and inadvertent trouble-making.The end is sure to get your mind working in overtime as Mr. Colfer presents a unique dilemna. Should a 4th book be in the works it can go in so many different directions. I for one, plan to be in line for that one as well."
3,"Fun definately, but not as good as the previous","I can't say I didn't enjoy this book. I really did like it, but the two previous books were much better. This book (as mentioned before) seems to be less well thought out... There is one singular plot and nothing else, it's just too darn simple. The jokes were funny, I liked the character developement, but the plot wasn't great. The book seemed to be a book made just so the characters could mature a bit more and so they develope. I'm expecting another sequel, especially with the ending ""cliff-hanger"". Anyway, if you buy this book, it's to complete your collection, and to have a few chuckles while reading."
4,"Hey, let's give Mulch some credit","I don't know what you all read, but Mulch-Diggums had me cracking up. I think he needs his own story. The C-cube was very intellegent had me thinking there may already be one on the market. I enjoyed all three books. I felt a little sad for Butler and I think his sister should have a book of her own as well as the fairy people. It's a book meant to entertain and that it did and does well."
5,COLFER DOES IT AGAIN!,"An addicting book is Artemis Fowl The Eternity Code. The best book in the series written by Eion Colfer. Artemis tries to do buisness with an elite buisnessman Jon Spiro. Butler gets mortally injured. Fowl needs help from the fairies. Will they help Butler or not? Here is an exciting part of the book. "" Key codes. Okay. Cameras. No problem. Wait until I show you wha I've devoloped for CCTV cameras. I'm fast forwarding through the corriders. Dum de dum de dum, ah, the vault. Pressure pads, antibiotic mats. Motion sensors. Tempature sensitive lasers. Thermal cameras, voice recognition, retina and gel thumbprint scanners."" You would like this book if you like action, technology, fairies, and stuff like that. It is a GREAT book!!!!"
3,Great portrail of characters and enlashing Artemis' genius,"A good book, a nice broadening of the spectrum. But the Story got a little predictable, towards the end, and you know Artemis will always win. Overall good story but this is one to get at the library.Enjoy:)"
4,A fairly good Book,I liked this book very much because it had suspense and a lot of descriptive words. This book is a fairly long book but you will never want to put it down. This book also has a lot of similes and metaphors. This book there was two people I liked one was Butler and one was Artemis. Butler is very gallant; he is Artemis's body guard. Artemis talks in a very savvy way. He thinks he knows everything and he does. John Spiro kidnaps Artemis's C-Cube (mini super computer). Now Artemis must get back his computer before he finds out the secret language and the password and get back from the Spiro Needle (the building that the C-Cube is being held captive). Although Artemis has a lot of strident words in his vocabulary but they is still not enough to save the cube. After Artemis is captured he must rely on Butler and use his brains to outsmart the multi-billionaire John Spiro. Will Artemis ever get out of the Spiro Needle?
3,Nooooooooo,"I really wanted to love this book, beacuse i liked the first two so much, but the part were butler gets shot is cliched right down to the drawn out ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOO."" But Juliet was in it more, which made up for it. Artemis is also gettting disgustingly nice. He was so much more fun evil! The main problem is that this was a great ending to a trilogy, but Eion Colfer has to go and publish a fourth book, and i'll end up reading it anyway."
4,Artemis keeps on chugging...,"Another good book in this series as Artemis tries to become a good person, but just can't resist dabbling in a little bit of crime again. He truly begins to change once he realizes that he is constantly putting family and friends (yes, he now can consider many in the fairy world his friends!) in danger because of his need to be smarter than everyone else. This book has as many twists and turns as the other AF books and continues Artemis' character development in a nice way."
4,Eternity Code By Eoin Colfer,i read this book after eading the reviews on this site and i enjoyed it over any other artimis fowl book i have read this book is full of exciting twists. The book starts with danger and continues to enthrall through out. an excelent book the only draw back is its a childrens book.
4,Great Book by Eion Colfer,omg this waz such a good book i culd read ovr and ovr! totaly awesom good caracters 2!
5,!@#$%^%$#,"Artemis FowlThis book has it all. Includind action, violence, and confusing codes. For action it's got lots of gun fights + bombs. For violence it has burring people alive. And the best is confusing codes including a person a dworf and a fairy breaking into a high teck vault!!"
5,very good book,I really liked the book. I would read for hours not being able to stop. The end was really sad and left me thinking that there is another one on its way. The friendship between Artemis and Holly had grown in the 16 months of their friendship and it seems that some way Artemis will find the fairies once again.
4,A Good Ending,"This is the third book in the series. Basically, Artemis'(one of the main characters) C cube is stolen. He has to fight for it with a little help while having to sneak around behind his parents' backs. I really liked this book, but it was a little too predictable for my tastes. It was a great ending to a good series."
5,Great books,This is one of the best series for boys (okay Girls might like it too) EVER. Bought the whole set.
4,really good but end just doesnt measure up,"The third installment of Artemis Fowl is just as magical and magnicent as the books. Maybe even more, it had action adventure and took place in the human world instead of the fairy one. THe villan was more real and terrifying than the first two books becuase it was something that could really happen with a multimillionair who doesnt care about other people or the environment, and for the first time, artemis fowl is on the fairies side. But sadly the end of the book wasnt as good and just cut off, like im doin right now!!"
5,The Greatest Book Since...Sliced Bread XD,"This has got to be one of the best books I have ever read. Artemis Fowl is a wonderful hero-suave, cool, and undeniably brilliant. The story is fast-paced and easy to read. My favourite part is at the end, where once again, Artemis manages to decieve the world. Again. So finishing with that ambiguous comment, I shall leave you to read the book yourself and find out what happened! One of the few books worth the money you spend on it."
4,Fun for all the family,"The usual characters are back for a third instalment, yet the writing remains fresh and crisp. You know what to expect in this book, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable to read.I recommend it for all the family, I'm nearly forty and I thought it was great, as did my ten-year-old daughter.J. K. Rowling could learn a lesson from these books: keep it simple!"
4,Artemis Fowl,"Eion Colfer came out with his latest fantasy book, Artemis Fowl, Eternity Code the third book he made.In this book Artemis Fowl's father was held captive by Mafia for two years, and his father said that he should not commit any crimes. But, Artemis Fowl want to commit one more crime. He created a computer that can do fairy magic that was stolen with fairy technology fifty years before it was even made! It was called C cube. But a character named John Spiro made a trap, stole the computer, and killed a character named Butler. Artemis's, only hope is to make fairy magic for his friend Captain Holly of the fairy police.In conclusion, this book is very good for ages 10-13. I myself liked the book and all the other books named The Artic Incident and Artemis Fowl, because it is so amazing with all these cool things. It is a good book."
4,"Colfer Still Has It, Just Not as Much","I enjoyed this just as I did the previous two books in the series, but it seemed to be a little lower on the scale. The first is by far the best, but the second was quite good as well. This one started off well enough, but after Butler ""ages"" things seems to get a little off track. Once the book gets back on target it seems a little too predictable at times. It started off so well and I was really looking forward to it, but I think the lack of the underworld's involvement in the story hurt. There were parts that kept me yearning for me though so overall I give this book a good rating and I will read the 4th installment for sure."
4,Fast and full of action.,"Action and suspense create this book. I felt a bit downhearted when Butler changed ( I won't tell you how, because it would ruin the story for you). I highly recommend reading this book."
5,This is the best one in the seires so far!,this is the best on out of the first 4 (havent read others). great book with humor and action!
5,"Artemis Fowl, Good Book or Same Ole Same Ole?","This was the third book in the Artemis Fowl series, and the good thing about Artemis Fowl is, it's not like Harry Potter where it gets darker and darker, and its not like harry potter where you have the same things happen, THERE IS A GREAT TWIST IN EVERY BOOK!!!! I would HIGHLY recommend this book to you.If you have or have read the first two books, you'll know that he finally has rescued his father and he wants to get everything back on track, but before he does, he wants to do one last thing, and that's all I can tell you without spoiling anything, but once again, I would get this book if I were you, and look, I DID GET IT :)."
3,Not as entertaining as 1 & 2,"I see that Colfer has left himself a wee opening for an Artemis Fowl #4 and if there were one, I would read it. The Eternity Code's pacing is slower than books #1 and #2 but it's just as tight and almost just as entertaining. While on the one hand I was glad to see Butler make it through to the end, the book would have been stronger in many regards if he hadn't. I was also suprised to see Artemis' parents suddenly absent after they were Artemis' raison d'etra in books #1 and #2."
2,Not a great Book,"The First book was great. But in this one, it's all too predictable and Artemis is no longer much of a villain. He seems a lot too noble and the story is not exactly unique."
1,Is the Artemis Fowl Series REALLY over?:(,"Artemis Fowl, boy genius and criminal mastermind, is back for another criminal activity. But this time, it's his last one. Since his father's been revived, he's been thinking about giving up, but there's one more thing to do, and that's to squeeze another couple of million dollars from a software company boss. Jon Spiro.Armed and considerably smart, Artemis's plan somehow backfires and he is forced to contact his old-nemesis-new-friend Captain Holly Short of the LEPrecon unit. Because this time, his crime involves the Fairy People whether they like it or not...This may not be the best book in the series, but it's still brilliant, and I still can't believe Mr. Colfer's putting a lid on Artemis Fowl! Oh well, let's hope his new book, the Supernaturalists is just as great..."
3,Not as good as the first two,"I thought Artemis Fowl number three was good, yet I don't believe that it was nearly as good as the first two. I myself found it to be a little too gruesome, and thought the end was sad. Yet Artemis Fowl is always two steps ahead so don't give up hope.13 year old reader."
1,A disgrace to both science fiction and fantasy genres,Any BELOW-AVERAGE kid will come up with a better and more interesting plot during a boring dungeon & dragons game.
2,statue is low quality.,"I was rather disappointed when I took the statue out of the box. The statue has the same detail as the image shows, however it is not a bronze statue. It is a plastic statue that has been spray painted with a bronze like color. When I purchased this it was on sale for $39.95 . After seeing this statue in person, I wouldn't have paid over $10 for it. The image they show is an actual bronze statue. If you buy this product, don't expect to get a statue made of bronze. If you like plastic spray painted statues, then this is the perfect one for you."
4,Does most things well,"Top quality sllicer. Cleans like a dream. Only problem I had was in slicing fresh bread, the slices tended to catch on the plastic blade protector. Other than that It did all things well."
5,Good slicer for the price,"I love having this slicer around. It allows me to cut meats as thin as I like for making sandwiches. I use it frequently on roasts, and when I smoke brisket. Great product. Also it comes apart quite easily for clean up."
5,Superb Purchase,"I purchased this slicer for my wife and I to use at home. The unit is easy to use and a piece of cake to clean... and the price is right, too. My wife is a chef, and she is extremely pleased with this unit."
2,Flatware for giants,"I am a pretty big guy and like Euro style continental sized flatware, but these are for giants. It's not just length but the overall heft and width. Way too big. The knife's handle is hollow and super thick. There is no way it would not fall off the plate if carried on it.Surprisingly poorly finished unlike other Yamazaki sets I have seen. Quality control lacking, my set came with two dinner forks, instead of one dinner and salad forks.If you're 7 ft and 300 lbs these may be for you."
2,Cheap looking,I purchased these earrings for a Xmas gift and was very disappointed. The photo looks MUCH better. This is the 2nd time I purchased from this seller and returned the item. I won't buy from them again.
3,eh... so-so.,"The majority of this record is incredibly mediocre, so don't expect the world from this thing. ""Back From Samoa"" is good, and worth listening to, and ""Inside My Brain"" is alright, but the other two records really don't interest me, namely ""STP not LSD."" That one's pretty rank. Don't say I didn't warn you, because this record will probably just take up space on your shelf. Tape the good songs off your friend's Angry Samoans records if you don't have money to burn."
1,PLEASE DON'T BOTHER,"Some may call me blasphemous for despising this album, but let me tell you, this is not what punk is supposed to be. With the same tempo and tune dominating each song, and with lyrics that mean nothing (that is if you can understand them), this album has no originality. I realize that originality is not what punk is known for, but this is pathetic. Punk should move you to action, whether socially, through the lyrics, or physically, through the music. This album does neither. And most importantly, it does not do the genre of old-school punk justice."
4,one of the best punk records ever,"Sloppy guitars, funny lyrics, catchy melodies, and really bad attitudes. This record is what punk is all about - but few punk bands ever achieve. Put this on the list of all time greatest with:Minor Threat - The Complete DiscographyOperation Ivy - Operation IvyCircle Jerks - Group SexBad Religion - Suffer (back when they were good)"
5,angry samoans rule!!!! fast old school punk anthems!!!!,"dont buy a single get the set its a complete discograph all there songs.includes famous stuff such as lights out,and gas chamber some of my favorite old school.fast tempo but unbelivably clear"
4,what happened in the dark?,"this is an edgey independent feature film that follows a group a ex high school students who are, one by one, graphically killed by a serial killer. shot with available light, this film evokes the feel of ""blair witch project""buy it and watch it with a loved one."
5,Great product!,"This is a great ring for the price! Looks good and feels on the finger. Excellent service from Old Glory, too!Cut-out Celtic Knot - Sterling Silver Ring"
5,Learning One Mans' Dad Journey,"I needed to read this book to help my two young sons understand what is is to be a father to their children. You see, my sons have not had a dad since age 4 and 5 and are now 20 and 21. and fathers in their own right. I was directed to this book by friends and it did not let me down. Hogan deals with the ups and downs of fatherhood, marriage maintainence and handling multiple children. Hilling also shares his adjustment to parenting a disabled child. A valuable resource to men and women alike in parenting from a very insightful and honest man."
5,Dr Bartsich is the fibroid KING,All I will say is this...I have struggled with fibroids for years and Dr Bartsich is a gift...he is the best doctor/surgeon you can ever ask for. If you struggle with fibroids he is the doctor you want.
2,Well,"I bought this movie because I'm a huge Lance Henriksen fan. The movie is kind of mindless. I would have gone a different direction with this movie. I'm not wanting to reveal anything about the movie. But it seems when a movie lacks its because of the poor writing, not the wonderful acting by Lance Henriksen and others. Danielle Harris was wonderful in this. Worth watching as long as you dont expect the movie to Wow you."
3,Loud and heavy,"On the plus side, the brushed stainless steel exterior makes it a breeze to wipe clean and the fact that no heating element is inside the pot itself prevents hard water deposit buildups. On the down side, this is one LOUD kettle. Most kettles get loud only at the boiling point but this thing sounds like an airplane is taking off from your kitchen each time to turn it on ! I also found it to be heavier than average while empty which of course makes it VERY heavy when it's full of water. For the price I guess it does the job if you don't mind the loud noise and the weight."
2,"Homely, and now broken","I received this kettle as a gift and never loved it--the brushed-steel look is not me, and the design is impractical, as well, as there's no way to see whether the kettle is full or boiling unless you open the lid. But I wanted to have an electric kettle for my two annual tea parties, so I did keep and use it.I used it *only* for these parties, of which I have two every winter. On each occasion, I used this kettle to boil perhaps eight pots of water. And the kettle lasted no more than three winters (possibly two--I don't recall exactly when I got it) before it stopped working. Now the light doesn't come on, and the water doesn't get heated.So after no more than 48 uses (2 tea parties x 3 years x 8 pots of tea), I have an ugly, dead electric kettle. It was never dropped, immersed, or otherwise mistreated. It simply died. I am therefore very disappointed in this brand and would never buy it again."
4,Exploring Candle Magick,I was not as impressed as I was with my other book called Candleburning Rituals by Marie Bruce that I bought. I like my Candleburning Rituals the best. It had alot of information in it. This book is not as easy as the Candleburnig Rituals is. I will be studying this one more but right now I am using the Candlburing Ritual book.
5,Great Buy,This machine delivers. Anyone who says anything otherwise is not reading the manual to answer any questions they may have. Customer service from Brother has been very helpful too when I was just being a big dork.
2,I got problems with this machine!!!,"I used the MFC just a little over one year, and its main circuit board failed resulting into malfunctioning of the fax. Cost of repair over $200! A few months later the copier started giving problem - a vertical band on the right hand side and uneven (faded) ink on the left hand side of the document. I changed the toner but no result. Scanner does not produce good quality on photographs. Tech support were not successful in solving the problems most of the times."
1,"Brother MFC9600, a big disappointment!","We bought the MFC9600 in early 2000. It appears to have all the popular functions integrated into a nicely designed unit. However, after 3 months of light usuage, serious problems started to appear. First bands started to appear on the copied pages. Changing the toner cartridge did not help. Then the paper feeder for the flatbed started jaming paper. Forget about faxing multi-page documents. We started calling the ""beast"", the ""paper eating machine"". It does a ""better job"" in shredding paper than faxing or copying, if you have to use the paper feeder. Even the faxed document comes out to be with disappointing poor quality.This product appears to have the right idea of including highly integrated office automation functions. It just does not have the quality that makes this to be the workhorse for a small office. We ended up buying an HP 3200 to do the faxing and laser printing and still trying to figure out what to do with the MFC9600 that we bought."
4,"Quite nice, but for the scanner","I have a home office, and was looking to clear up some space. I had an HP flatbed scanner which took up quite a bit of room, so I opted for the MFC9600 which had one included. I'm fairly happy with all functions of the MFC except for the scanner. My old scanner, in conjunction with OmniPage Pro, did a marvelous job of OCR, but with this scanner, I end up retyping most of the document myself. The resolution just isn't there. And I think they need to put more effort into fine tuning the Win2000 printer drivers. My whole system slows down and my mouse becomes jerky whenever I print something - it seems to use a lot of resources. And the Brother Resource Manager has a look and feel of an old Windows 3.0 program to it - not very refined."
2,I wish I'd known...,"I wish I'd known that this was an unnaturally scented product. The general consistency of the shampoo and the combined oatmeal and baking soda are fabulous. Why in the world does it have to be ""tropical scent""? And why oh why wasn't I warned about this in the product description?"
5,just great,"my shih tzu pup loves bath time and this stuff smells great and is dilutable so i highly recommend it,so does the vets and dont forget the conditioner they are a great duo especially if u have a hairy dog like mine!"
4,Great:) Definitely buying again... probably soon.,"I read an EXTREME amount of reviews.. before I ended up buying this product.I recently got a dog and I bought some regular shampoo at Petco.My requirements for a dog shampoo was:1) long lasting smell2) controls (somewhat) shedding3) nice, healthy, shiny fur coatSo far I have used it once and the shampoo doesn't beat the OVERPOWERING dog smellbut does smell less ""dog-like"".As for the shedding, I don't know if she is naturally finished up on her sheddingor if the shampoo actually worked but she is SHEDDING way less!What I have learned to LOVE about this product... was her noticeably SHINYY AND SOFTTT COAT!:) on the directions it says to use twice in one bath and I did but I believe for my roughly 40 lbsdog ... will use up the bottle in 2-3 more baths.I will definitely be buying this product again."
5,Stopped the Itching,"My son's pug was always scratching, as many pugs do. I tried hot spot medications likeSulfodene First Aid Skin Medication for Dogs, 4oz.which worked beautifully for the sore, red spots, but didn't help with the all over itching she experienced. Rather than buying one of the more expensive shampoos people were recommending, I decided to try cheaper first ... and it worked! No more intense itching, her ""prickly"" fur is nice and soft, and she smells so nice. Give this one a try before spending more money. I don't think you will be sorry!"
5,Stinky pup no more!!!,"I have a 13 year old ""pup"" with gland problems, so she smells pretty bad at times. She is a beautiful English Cocker Spaniel, whose hair is thick as sheep. I tried this Fresh N'Clean Shampoo this weekend and boy does it work. Hair is silky and smell is gone, leaving a clean smelling fragrance. I even think Sundae likes the aroma! Price is great for such a large bottle. Try it, you won't be disappointed.Since, I am a Prime member, this came overnight for free (I know it's supposed to be 2 days, but often it comes in one)"
3,stinks!,"it came in the mail busted open. it did not smell good, yuck. no thanks, we will not be getting a replacement."
5,Clean and smells great,"Compare to other oatmeal shampoo, this product smells wonderful, but not over-powering. It lasted a few days on my highly active german shepherds. I will purchase this product again, in a larger size."
4,Awesome series!,We just love the show 2 & 1/2 Men!! Great timing for them to release the series on DVD - we had just been discussing it was a series we'd love to have. The one liners are just great! Especially when we've had a rough day at work - popping in an episode of 2 & 1/2 Men gives us the comic relief we need!Keep the seasons coming!
5,LOVE THIS SHOW!,Great show; you'd think Charlie Sheen & Jon Cryer were really brothers. Love the outtakes!
5,Two and a Half men,DO NOT ORDER FROM THE UK. IT WILL NOT WORK ON YOUR U.S. DVD PLAYER. I LEARNED THE HARD WAY.
3,"Sigh, It's a Sitcom","I can usually rate a series by whether or not I want to see the next season. In the case of 2 and Men, guess I'll catch it on cable because it really doesn't matter if it's viewed chronologically, mildly amusing, but no great shakes.The Charlie Sheen character has an ancestor on 1950's TV, the Bob Cummins role in Love That Bob. They should have stuck to that idea more closely, because the 1950's swinger and pinups seem to be having genuine fun. Charlie Sheen, I have no idea why a woman would want him unless California chicks are pathetic beach house groupies. Hmm, maybe they are? Charlie's more regimented brother, Jon Cryer, come on, he's not believable as a husband or a parent. Throw in the usual wacko's, demented neighbors, and overbearing mothers. Sigh, it's a sitcom."
1,Not Ordered.,I did not order Two and a Half Men: The Complete First Season. I ordered a different one and it was great.
4,Missing friends?,I have been looking for something to replace friends and enjoyed this more than Joey. Althiugh can' understand why we can get on DVD in the UK when it is not out in the US.
2,Whoes the half man?,"Charles Francis ""Charlie"" Harper (Charlie Sheen) and Jacob David ""Jake"" Harper (Angus T. Jones), the kid, are the two men and Alan Jerome Harper (Jon Cryer) is the half man.MAN, MAN, MAN, MAN, MANLY, MAN, MAN...love the irony."
5,Two and a Half Men - The Complete First Season,We have really enjoyed watching this program and hope the second season is released soon.
5,Funny Stuff,"Two and a Half Men is more for adults and really funny. The two brothers are so opposite but both equally funny. The young boy is a natural comedian.The housekeeper, Berta, is a hoot. I wish she was my housekeeper! Berta tells it how it is and hysterical. Her expressions are priceless. The two brothers also have quite the mother!!! I look forward to the other seasons coming out."
4,Two and a Half Men - First Season,"Fantastic series; you get a grip on who these three guys really are. Alan and Jake are my favourites; they seem so real, you feel like you know what they're going through. Very funny with trying to hard to be funny. I definately have to get Season 2 & 3. Highly recommended."
5,great seller,"I would buy from this seller again. DVD came quickly, was brand new, and in packaging just like described."
5,Phenomenal,"This album is perfection from start to finish. I heard the CD the first time quite by accident and now I can't get through a day without listening to Mr. Gray's soothing voice. A must-have for anyone who appreciates well-crafted, thoughtful music in this day of bubble-gum pop."
4,An excellent buy!,If you like Dave Matthews than odds are that you will like David Gray. I personally had never heard of David Gray until the local radio station started playing 'Babylon II' and the lryics combined with David's interesting voice had me hooked! I can honestly say that I really enjoy listening to the whole CD. You really can't go wrong here...
5,My oh my,"My friend lent me this album because she was listening to it too much. I took it home, listened to the first song, and was immediately attached. David Gray shows a great amount of musical talent and no other singer has a voice quite like his. The lyrics are quite intricate and well put together. This album is wonderful, I can't wait to get it for myself along with his other works. I definately recommend it."
5,Passionate Poetic Brilliance...,"I doubt that there will ever be another artist that emanates such passionate poetic brilliance as David Gray. You can continue to read the raving reviews of this CD right here, or you can stop right now and purchase what will undoubtedly be the CD that will have a permanent place on your CD player...unless of course you have to replace it with a new copy because you wore the first one out by playing it constantly. Come to think of it, just purchase three copies, one for home, one for your car, and one for the office...yes, you will listen to it that much !"
5,Amazing,"If Van Morrison and Bob Dylan had a child, he might sound like David Gray. Beautiful, complex melodies and insightful lyrics. Don't miss out on the year's best disc."
4,SOLID,"It's a bold statement, but truly - this is unlike almost anything I've ever heard. It's pop, but not quite. Alternative rock, yet quite mellow. Folky - just a twinge. But it adds up to a sound quite enjoyable and unique. The tracks are crisp and catchy, and listening almost makes me feel... ""clean"" at times. It's simply really clean music. And if you are ever able to take advantage of those special features on the enhanced CD -check 'em out. There are a few live clips from shows, and just seeing them once gave me a better appreciation for this guy's energy, if you ever doubt it from just listening. Certainly, some tracks are better than others (it starts off quite strong and then sags a tad in the middle), but finding an album this solid nowadays (in this world of synthesized boring bubblegum cheesy-pop), is extremely refreshing."
4,DRUM MACHINE!,"As a long-time David Gray fan, I was shocked to hear the drum tracks on this album closely resembling those played at dance clubs. I understand that a two-man band is hard-pressed to record their own drums without technological assistance, but with the raw voice and sound I've come to expect and love from David Gray, one would think he'd be against such canned noise.Despite this, I was as impressed with this album as I was of his first two (not a fan of Sell, Sell, Sell, except for a couple of songs). After the first couple of songs, the drum machine steps quietly into the background, and we're left with Gray's beautiful voice, lyrics, and melodies. Also, some of the bass tracks on this album are the best I've heard from him, and his guitar is, as usual, splendid.And, you know, maybe those songs with particularly intrusive drum tracks aren't so bad. I've been too depressed by them to listen to their entirety. Let me know if I'm wrong.prussell@welseyan.edu"
5,David Gray works wonders with words and sounds,"I know this man has been around a long time, but I just started listening to his songs about a month ago. He has a wonderful way of putting words together with sound that flows. Really enjoy listening to his songs, most of the album is much better than average, 4 songs I consider outstanding works of art."
5,David Gray is THE MAN,"I love David Gray. Enough said. His lyrics are wonderful, his style of music is phenomenal, and the whole deal about him recording a CD without all the fanfare... Seems others must like him like Bonnie Raitt.. remaking Silver Lining... which I must add, he's much Bettah! Track 1 is one of those songs that remind me of summer, cruising down the interstate as fast as my foot will allow... :) If you love Irish accents, love poetical lyrics that are instantly adored, here's your next CD :)"
3,This may be the most overrated release of the last few year,"What is all the hype about. This isn't bad cd, it just isn't very good. Don't believe all the hype you've heard about this one."
2,Not at all what I expected...,"...and that about sums it up! I loved the song, Babylon, and purchased this CD because I felt that the writer/vocalist of that song must surely be able to compile a memorable CD. The fact that two versions of Babylon are on the CD should have been a tip of sorts. Clearly, the version I enjoy so much is one that has been worked with in the studio. Some producer somwhere obviously felt the need to remix the song in order to give it the style and feel that made it the hit it was. The remaining tracks reveal the mediocre ability of the artist. I really was ready to love this CD when it arrived, but after five listenings, my feelings remain the same."
3,Not what I expected at all,"It's a good CD, but there's a reason Babylon and This Year's Love are heard on the radio. They're agreeable to far more people. Pretty much the only two tracks I care to listen to."
3,Extremely overrated,"David Gray's album isn't terrible; he's a decent singer and lyricist. But, I have to admit that I'm confused by the critical acclaim that this album has received. Yeah, Dave Mathews likes this album, but don't get tricked into thinking that this sounds like the Dave Mathews Band. This album is much more quiet and subtle, and not nearly as interesting musically.If you're looking for smart, modern, folk insired music, I'd suggest checking out albums by Joe Henry first."
3,Awesome Album- But copy protected!,"The music on this cd is wonderful, but I had to return it. I will not purchase albums that I cannot rip to my mp3 player for personal use."
2,Drum Machines are best used in moderation....,"If you liked the early David Gray for the raw emotion and stripped down delivery of those great songs, don't buy this album expecting more of the same. From the first song, the replacing of the rythym section with a drum machine and keyboard is apparent, and annoying. You can tell the songs are quality, if you can get past that, but I find this album unlistenable as I am continually trying to imagine what the songs would sound like with a human backline."
3,Overstatement,"This is good but not great. You would be pleased to hear it playing in the background and have it in your collection. The voice of David Gray is what adds the texture to this work. His voice has the strength of Simply Red, the pace of Dylan, and only approaches (but in a valiant attempt) the qualities of Van Morrison. The songs flow well together; however, the weakness is reliance on canned instrumental music and lyrics that are great in some songs and average in others. I especially enjoyed #7, White Ladder, with that touch of static hiss, who would have thought we would miss vinyl with all of its drawbacks. A final note to all you critics out there: the mood of an album is often set by the attitude you bring to an album, White Ladder may have a reflective pace but that doesn't mean it is meant to have a feeling of melancholy."
2,Sorry to be different but...,"I first heard this album several years ago, in 2001 in fact, and fondly remembered ""Babylon"" and ""Please Forgive Me"" ( the video to the latter is pretty cool ) so as I hear Babylon more and more on the radio I got caught up in it's beauty and ordered the whole album. My girlfriend and I agree the rest is whiny and dragging. 2 tracks does not make a whole album."
1,"BORING, REPETATIVE, UNIMAGINATIVE...STINKS","Here's what ya do. Play the same three chord progression over and over. Every now and then throw in a minor chord to make the song appear to have a chorus or a bridge. Moan the lyrics, attempting to do a bad impression of either Dave Matthews or Bob Dylan. Get some critic enamoured with your words of longing and love, hope you get a good ""alternative"" review. If you do your home free....for at least a few albums, and then hopefully disappear.This poor guy does not have an origional musical bone in his body. He's the darling of the moment, and without a mention from Dave Mathews would have gone nowhere. I'm trading this one in at the record store asap."
1,Indie this is not!!,"I must admit, all the hype that preceded this release, especially in the indie mags, had me anxiously awaiting its arrival in the stores. What a disappointment!! With all due respect to Mr. Gray, his songs are catchy, emotional gems that would fit nicely in any soft-rock FM station's playlist (and they do!). But I was really expecting something a little more adventurous sounding than the usual So-Cal/soft rock/America/Eagles formula that plagued most of the 70's and 80's. That's certainly not to say that this album does not have its place: perhaps the CD player of a large SUV, piloted by an aging boomer/Dave Matthews fan in the clutches of his/her midlife crisis would be the ticket. Anyone need a lightly used copy?"
1,A Waste Of Money,"I Loved the first single Babylon. But that's it. The rest of it is boring. I don't understand why this CD has gotten such high ratings. It really is not good. I really wanted to like it, and I'm disappointed that I don't. :( :( :( Sorry David."
4,strong collection of songs,"David Gray is a great songwriter and singer. This CD was a very pleasant discovery. The standout track is Please Forgive Me, which received a great deal of airplay in Ireland (where he is huge), but the standard is very high overall. Occasionally the home production detracts somewhat but mostly the spare sound highlights his vocals well. I will definitely check out his earlier stuff."
4,"Not Classic, But Close","In ""White Ladder"", David Gray has created a masterpiece of acoustic guitar playing. Gray has airy vocals complimenting his guitar parts fantastically. His songs are of a unique quality unlike other songwriters, but written to make sense on many levels. ""Babylon"", the famous single from this album, is a great viewpoint for judging the other songs by. It stands out as earnest and true, even more so than his other songs.My only complaint about the album is that towards the end the songs lose their uniqueness. Everything kind of mixes together into one big pot, no one song really differs wildly from another. I was disappointed to find that even after listening to the album a few times, I was unable to discern certain songs from each other.Hopefully Gray will eventually be able to put out another CD with more potential than White Ladder."
3,An Acoustic Tour-de-Force! (3 STARS),"No, I am not one of the groupies that followed David around for months at a time on his tours of the UK, though I believe it's great he has such loyal fans. I hadn't even heard the name David Gray until I listened to ""Babylon"" on the radio. I bought the album and was pleasantly surprised by his unique style and mellow, acoustic ballads.David has three singles off the album, ""Please Forgive Me,"" ""Babylon,"" and ""This Years Love,"" all beautiful pieces of work done in David Gray's own unique style. ""My Oh My,"" another slow beauty is one of the best ""filler"" tracks on the album, and ""sail away"" epitomizes the album's mood and setting. Overall, the album is very honest, very tongue-in-cheek, very art-full, and heartfelt. It was so good in fact, that I had to buy ""Lost Songs"" when it came out a little while ago. No wonder Dave Matthews called Gray one of his favorite all-time artists."
3,About as mediocre as you can get,"This is not a bad album and it is not a great album. I think you must be in the right mood for it. I must say, I love the music but David's voice is not appealing to me and if I dare say, even annoying at times. Would I suggest you buying it???? If you have a need for a less gravely throated Bob Dillion.....then this is for you."
2,"""White Ladder"" Nothing Remarkable","Wow. It's rare to see an album rated a clean 5 stars across the board, and for that reason alone I was willing to give this record a listen. Add to that the facts that I love the song ""Babylon"" and that Dave Matthews, whom I respect, claims to have listened to this record almost exclusivly for months. Armed with that information, I was prepared for a record that would sit at the top of my collection for a good, long time.Ho-hum. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. Perhaps it's just the hyperbolic whiplash inherent in overexpectation. Perhaps it's that David Gray writes lyrically mediocre songs then records them with undistinguished musical backing. Perhaps it's his grating voice, which works well on a single song, but annoys on an entire CD.I won't dispute the hundreds of other reviewers here and elsewhere who loved this album unquestionably. I'll just assume that I'm missing something and move on."
4,Great Relaxing Music,"I had a copy when it first came out but it got scratched, so I bought another. Good stuff"
4,Dylan-Like,"With today's music in the whirlwind it is in, David Gray brings back a sense of realism with his lastest album White Ladder. The recording has a ""live"" sound to it because of it's simplicity. Gray is a true poet and musician and his album gives you that inspiration. It is simple and pure with no money or contracts backing it up. No offense Moby. White Ladder has a folky-blues sound to it and if you search hard enough inside yourself you can almost feel as if you are sitting in the living room with Gray as you hear his lastest creation. Related artists: Bob Dylan, John Prine, Ben Harper, Kasey Chambers."
4,Another English Find,"I'm beginning to think that if one wants to find the best in pop music, one need only look to Great Britain. Like Badly Drawn Boy, whose exquisite ""The Hour of Bewilderbeast"" ranks up there with Travis's ""The Man Who"" as the best album of the year so far, David Gray is an English troubadour who blends tuneful melodies with heartfelt and witty lyrics to create an album filled with gorgeous songs. If you like Elliott Smith or Nick Drake (another great English folk artist), then this album won't disappoint. The best tracks in the album, of which there are many, are ""Please Forgive Me,"" ""This Year's Love,"" ""Babylon I"" and ""II"", ""Nightblindness, ""Sail Away,"" and best of all, Gray's lovely reworking of Soft Cell's ""Say Hello, Wave Goodbye."" A must-buy."
5,Ouch!,"I'm afraid that Dave Matthews might have shot himself in thefoot. I had never heard of David Gray until I found out that Matthewshad recommended him; being a long time DMB fan, I took him at his word and searched for ""White Ladder"" on Amazon.com. It took only listening to the snippets provided to decide that I was going to buy the CD. Since it was delivered it's been just about the only thing that I've listened to - - - kind of like when a little kid watches the same movie 47 times in a row. I can't help my self. The perfect blend of haunting tune and soulful lyrics has captivated me . . . and, as I alluded to before, I haven't been able to muster the will power to take ""White Ladder"" out of my CD player long enough to put in anything by the Dave Matthews Band. Perhaps after one more round of ""Babylon"" and ""My Oh My""."
3,White Ladder,"Still waiting for David Gray to put out an album with at least some resemblance to Century Ends. White Ladder has a few nice tunes, but is dragged down by a canny disco drum machine. Don't know why he doesn't stick to the simpler yet infinitely more appealing style of his first album."
5,What happened to me?,"That a few days ago I wrote ""Wide Ladders"" in place of ""White Ladder"". Doesn't matter: a good excuse to return here and make another five stars shine. And,o.k, ""This Years Love"" is an instant classic; but what about ""Please, Forgive Me"": something like Bob Dylan meets The Pet Shop Boys. Truly amazing!"
5,Pure!,"Hands down my favorite album of all time. David Gray has a sexy, emotional voice and his lyrics are incredibly moving. Check it out, it doesn't disappoint."
5,an amazing CD from an incredibly gifted singer/songwriter,"David Gray is phenomenal! All four of his CDs are excellent. Full of emotion, brilliant songwriting...there are not enough adjectives to describe how much I dig his music. Unfortunately his first CD ""Flesh"" is not available here. I highly recommend checking it out if you're into Dylan, Van Morrison... basically great singer/songwriters, you can't go wrong. ""White Ladder"" is terrific as well, less raw than ""Flesh"" or ""Century Ends"" but worth adding to your collection. If you don't own any of his music, pick one at random, and you'll be more than pleased when you pop it into your stereo. Enjoy! Trish"
5,my oh my,"I have just started listening to David Gray and ""My Oh My"" can't get enough!!!! This is my first CD by him and am looking forward to exploring more of this mans music- EXCELLANT - a must have!!!!"
4,Gray is much more like dylan than Van Morrison,"The amozon music editor needs an ear tune. Gray sounds nothing like Morrison in this album.Yes, if you read the other reviews you will see a lot of comparisons to Bob Dylan. Those reviewers are hearing what I am. His voice certainly is Dylan-ish, but better. This is a great sleepy time, rainy day, get sad album. I liked it, but it tends to get old fairly fast upun repeated hearing, but almost all albums can do that. I reccomnd this album."
4,"Great CD but wont ""play"" in computer",This cd is wonderfull. The music is amazing and helps one to relax. The only reason that I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because you MUST use thier interactive viewer to play the cd which can be a real pain.
1,Hmmm...,"I guess I'll be the dark horse among all of these five-star reviews. I hate to even take the time, however I wanted to try to forwarn anyone else purchasing this (as I did) based on the reviews alone -- and the radio song Babylon. Or maybe simply I just don't get it. I honestly still want to like this CD, but my sheer frustration with it always wins over as it is removed from my player after only 5-6 songs. Or maybe I'll have to give the second 1/2 an honest listen before carrying forth with my plans to exchange it. Track after track, it just all sounds the same. Simply, listening to it just brings me down - and angry at myself for once again buying an entire CD for one song."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,"The best thing about this CD is that you can use your ""back"" button to get a truly hidden track just before track one. But that song, like the rest of the album lulls and relies on a cheesy machine to back up what essential aren't very good songs. Maybe he's done better, maybe he's done worse. I'd never heard of him before and I'd rather I didn't have the CD."
3,it's ok-not great,"given the current state of crap that passes for music today (britney spears/nsync/backstreet boys and their ilk), it is understandable that many people would find this album the next big thing. i beg to differ. it is a good album with flaws. it is not a classic that many people are making it out to be. for starters-a real drummer (come on-they don't cost THAT much) would have given this album much more warmth. in addition, at least two of the songs would have benefitted without so much repeating of the main chorus. ('SAIL AWAY' is two minutes too long) a good pop song should not last more than 3.5 minutes MAX) just my opinion.....thanks for the space. p.s. mr. gray sounds more like the guy from simply red than dylan. and please-no more comparisions to the uncomparable van morrision. i do find this album far superior however to anything by davey matthews..."
1,not worth the money,"the cd, well its boring. i know that few people will read this being that it is so far back in the review section, but this cd is boring and redundant. without the help of Dave this man would be no where. his cd is alright, and babylon is a good song the first 5 times you listen to it, but it gets boring and the rest of the cd is very similiar. if you want a good new artist, listen to Jack Johnson, that is worth the money. i am either going to let ""white ladder"" sit in the back of my cd collection and get no play, or get rid of it... i really dont see what all the fuss is about. this man's album will be gone in a couple of years. i will give him this much, on stage it looks like he loves what he does, but i sure dont... DONT WASTER YOUR MONEY ON THIS CD, buy brushfire fairytales by JACK JOHNSON is worth the money..."
5,Compares well to Bose,"I bought the Klipsch iGroove so I could listen to my iPod while working on my car in the garage. We have a Bose iPod unit in the house so we can compare them side by side. Out of the box it looked a little small, but the sound out of that little Klipsch was awesome. Very pleased with the purchase."
4,Excellent Sound,We love the sound and clarity of the Klipsch iGroove. We looked at the iHome which has more features like a clock etc but if you want a serious player and are looking for sound quality ...the iGroove STX is it!
5,Big sound from small unit,"When I opened the box and saw the size of this unit, I wasn't sure about my purchase. After I connected the ipod and turned it on, I was amazed at the deep base and volumn. I am very pleased at the quality of sound this unit produces."
4,"stylish look, not bad sound quality for size",The speakers are pretty good although the sound is compromised at higher volumes. The appearance and general portability is great. We use it in our kitchen mostly. Satisfied overall.
5,"Wow, wow, wow!","How do you review something that's as near perfect as possible. Sound GREAT! Room filling. Amazing for it's size. Easy to use. Yes you have to be in sight view to use the remote. And that was my only fault with this system. The ""feel"" of the remote should be easy and smooth. It's not. Hard edges but really just an annoyance. They should have looked at Apples remote.Hefty for it's size. The power brick is normal size. The sound is really, really HUGE for it's size. Even at top volume the speakers hold the sound true and rich. iPod alarm works perfectly so it can double as an alarm clock as long as you're not an extra sleep button hitter.I love the sleep timer. I'd been using the TV sleep timer and have found I sleep better listening to some decent music.Overall a great little machine."
1,does not charge 4th gen ipod nano,sounds great but does not charge the nano 4th generation - not sure why apple has changed voltage on new products - BIG hassle to have to charge unit on USB cable since aftermarket chargers don't even work with nano 4g
5,Half the price as BOSE and just as good!,"I'm a VERY picky person when it comes to sound, and a huge music fan. I spent about a half hour at Best Buy plugging my I pod nano into every I pod dock they had on display, this Bose was great, but it was $400, so i tried the Klipsch, just as good! i turned it up ALL The way in the store, and the employee's and tons of Christmas shoppers didn't seem to mind. it has a surprising amount of bass for such a small object, and sounds great even at max volume, with little if any distortion. The ""line in"" is one of the reasons i choose this over a Bose, i can plug it into my computer (awesome internet radio!) or use it for movies on my TV, simply with a 6 foot $3 headphone cable.The remote is useless except for <10' muting and track skipping. although Ive got remote reception up to 20' its not likely.for an alarm clock, you can use your I pods alarm (make a ""wake up"" playlist)."
4,"Few, if any, downsides","For the price, the Klipsch system packs quite a punch. I investigated quite a bit of time in reviewing these products and the Klipsch SXT came out on top when compared to all others. It does not have $500 sound, but if that is what you are looking for there are systems out there to fit the bill. In addition, there seems to be the most complaints about how this does not have a built-in radio . A simple solution to that problem is to use your iTouch/iPhone and listen to Pandora or your favorite local station on the web commercial free. Klipsch was embracing technology when it built this devise, not going backwards by trying to add antequated technology like an FM receiver."
2,Find something else,This unit WILL NOT charge your IPOD TOUCH. The adapter plates don't work with the TOUCH either. I would of thought that the manufacturer would of had this issue addressed buy now. I waited awhile before purchasing in hopes of avoiding this issue. I was wrong!!
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased this product 5 months ago. Immediately, I didn't like the power cord. The connection will not fit properly (I'm assuming this is supposed to be a breakaway cord.) You must position the cord perfectly flat and level to maintain a connection. The sound is good and I felt I could deal with the issues with the cord. Now 5 months later, when I dock my Ipod I cannot get any sound. For a while I could unplug the unit and then the sound would work. Now nothing and the product is useless."
1,Avoid Avoid Avoid,"This looks lovely and worked like a dream and then, one day, it died. Outside of warranty. Amazon don't want to know and Klipsch UK aren't interested either. You get what you pay for. Save a little longer and get a Bose."
3,"Decent Item, Nice sound ... Freeze Ipod Problems",- Good sound (not great)- Easy to useBAD:Freeze the IPOD for Overheat.
1,piece of junk,"Hi, I bought the system less than 7 months ago. First of all, when you turned the sound up, there was background hissing. Then the volume became frozen at a lower level. I cannot turn it up or down. The last problem is that I cannot turn it off either with the remote or on the unit itself. I have to unplug it to turn it off. It is unbelievable that after just a short time the unit is operating so poorly. I would never recommend buying this product. What a big disappointment."
1,Not for use with Nano Chromatic,Does not recharge the Nano and drains the battery very fast.But the speakers themselves are nice and clear.
1,Disappointing for a Klipsch product,"I was really disappointed by the Klipsch docking station, especially considering the generally high quality of Klipsch speakers. This product doesn't produce balanced sound. I wasn't expecting something like the more expensive Bose docking station, but I had read from other reviews that Klipsch would still have very good sound.Consider buying Klipsch's speaker system with subwoofer for the computer, just as I have for my home computer. It's just a little more expensive, but the sound blows the Klipsch docking station away."
1,Poor Product,This was a big Christmas gift and worked no more than 1 week and is not working well now. Very disappointed in this product and have no use for this company and their products.
5,Great sound at a reasonable price,"I looked into a lot of different docking stations. I wanted a docking station for my ipod that had a big, clear sound, but that was reasonably priced. I found it with this product. I use it with my older ipod nano (1 GB) and my brand new ipd nano (8 GB)."
5,klipsch I Groove,"Better than my Bose for sound quality. Great price , Great product, Great sound. This player sounds great in a large room and is user friendly, only a few controls but really all you need to enjoy great music."
1,DOES NOT LAST,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND MY IGROOVE SOUND SYSTEM STOPPED WORKING JUST AFTER WARRANTY ENDED. CANT FIND A PLACE TO TAKE REPAIR, STUCK WITH SOUND SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT WORK."
3,"Great sound, does NOT work with iPhone 3G","Caution, not all Apple devices are supported. It does not work with the iPhone 3G.Other than that, the sound is wonderful.I'm returning it and buying the Amazon Editor's Choice, Altec Lansing T612 Digital Speaker for iPod and iPhone."
5,Great quality and great price!,"I had looked at the many different options before choosing the Klipsch iGroove SXT. Out of the systems I had listened to, it was down to the Klipsch and the Bose SoundDock. To me, after listening to the two side-by-side, there wasn't enough difference to justify the +$100 price difference of the Bose. I've have used both Bose and Klipsch products in the past, and have been very satisfied with both. If you're in the market for an affordable iPod speaker solution, this is definitely worth taking a listen to!"
3,Klipsch SXT review 2_2_09,"hello i bought this since it was a gold box price of $70 plus shippingi reviewed others in it class like the Altec Lansing and JBL and Ihome products. most reviews were in store except the Igroove for the money could not be beat but if i had the extra $$$ i would have gone for the JBL on stage 200ID i like better highs and bass than what the Igroove puts out.To me the igroove sounds flat i even changed the EQ setting on my 3G nano and it helps but still not enough for me?i'm keeping is spite of it short comings and since my wife likes it it's staying. :)pros: charges my ipod, decent sound quality, decent build quality, looks good, compact, remote controller includedcons: flat sound, directional sound, bass,"
4,High Quality Big Sound,"This iPOD System is very nice and sits in our kitchen, it provides a big sound that fills the whole downstairs and there is no loss of fidelity. For a small 2 speaker system it captures all of the high's and lows very well only lacking a subwoofer for depth on really deep bass tones.The remote is a definite bonus and has good range, the ability to change tracks, pause and increase volume from across the room is nice.Glad I purchased this product."
3,"small speakers, small sound","I have the logitech z5500Logitech Z-5500 THX-Certified 5.1 Digital Surround Sound Speaker Systemfor my living room, the logitech z2300sLogitech Z-2300 THX-Certified 2.1 Speaker System with Subwooferfor my computer room. So i know what a decent system should sound like. I wanted something for my bedroom. I did the research and ended up buying klipsch just to see how their product sounded. I am not impressed at all. I mean it serves the purpose of just playing music from my ipod well enough but it is not good quality. I prefer to listen to metal and currently Killswitch Engage is playing. The speakers are turned up about 3/4 of the way and the best way to describe it is, sounds like its got a large blanket laying over it. Very muffled. May look into a bose sounddock and give this to my kid. So theres my 2 cents.***o yea i have a 3gen ipod touch it does not support charging***"
2,Klipsch v AltechLansing,"Having owned Altec inMotion speakers for XMRadio/Pioneer Units, decided to try the Klipsch iGroove SXT Speaker. Looks good, but ends there, the iPod Touch 3G falls out of the dock (does not lock), the power supply failed within hours of setting it up - sent it back and ordered the Altec inMotion Compact iM310 for the iPod. The iPod does not fall out, the unit is totally portable/foldable, deep bass, it charges the iPod, and can be used with batteries, unlike the Klipsch plus a 2 year warranty to boot - what a great deal only $65 v $150 for the Klipsch from Amazon."
5,awesome little speaker,This little speaker is packed with sound! I absolutely am in love with it. The sound quality is terrific and the volume output is amazing. I have a nano and had been looking for something I could afford versus the cost of a Bose. This speaker delivered big time. I just plug it in whereever I am and it's like a mini stereo system with BIG sound. I used it out by the pool today and thoroughly enjoyed it!It came in the mail quickly and the deal on Amazon was the best I found!
5,"""This is a Terrific Book""","This memoir by John Finerty--one of the best reporters of his day--is a terrific read, especially for anyone interested in the Great Plain's Indian wars,in the U.S. Cavalry, and/or the Indians themselves. Finerty wanted to ride with Custer when reporting on the war but his editor made him follow Gen. George Crook. Good thing. But Finerty saw his share of action, being many times forced to stop writing and begin shooting. If you want a contemporary-sounding account of these battles and men, pick up this book."
5,Great book,"It was a present for my fiancee, he's thrilled! :) He didn't think I'd be able to find this anywhere! :)"
5,WOW!!!,"I'm new to jazz. This is my first Gerald Albright CD and all I can say is ""WOW!"". I am truly blown away. I love this CD."
5,Soulful Saxophone Music,"Gerald Albright is so skilled, his music will bring tears to your eyes. He puts his heart & soul into his playing. It is a pleasure to listen to him. This is an excellent collection of songs."
4,Best of Gerald Albright,"This review may be very partial; I have always been a fan of any of Gerald Albrights work and this cd did not fail me in the least. It comes highly recommended!I loved the cd but would have loved songs of his creative genius; half of the cd were remakes of Luther Vandross, Babyface and other well known artist's music.Other than that, it's worth adding to to your cd collections."
5,Excellent,"This is the perfect cd for someone not familiar wih Albrights work -- or something who wants to skip the ""mixed tape"" process. Filled with amazing renditions of popular songs and classics, this cd will fill your stereo for hours. You will not be disappointed!"
2,Not a companion to anything!,"If you are a classics scholar or student, you might find this book to your liking--although I'd recommend you browse through it in a bookstore before buying it online, sight unseen. Just keep in mind, it is NOT A COMPANION to Greek Tragedy as it claims, which to my mind implies that it is a reference book about the tragedies and their authors. Instead, this book is simply a short collection of seemingly random and unrelated essays about select tragedies. This book looks like someone's attempts to get tenure in their department more than anything else. If you're writing a dissertation on Euripides or Aeschylus perhaps you'll find a tidbit of scholarship in this book that will make it worth the price, but if you're just a fan of Greek Tragedy there are better books to buy."
4,Great sauce with strange taste...,"This is a GREAT hot sauce with a strange taste. This sauce will make your whole mouth warm causing anything you eat after to burn. Nice affect! If they can get rid of the strange taste, I would be putting this on everything."
5,"A humorous look at our bodies, our minds and our emotions! Funny stuff",Cheryl and Tom have a word with telling it exactly how it is. I can't describe how funny it is to see such candor! A great read to keep beside the bed or on a coffee table for all to view. I'd much rather read this over and over again than read any fashion magazine out there. Go women and I can't wait for Book Two!
4,"Funny, funny book","Miller has written a great book that is packed with laughs and commentary. It's better than his first book, Rants, because he mostly (and mercifully) stays away from the extremely obscure pop culture references."
5,Hilarious and thought-provoking,"This follow-up to ""The Rants,"" continues on in the tradition of Miller's intelligent comments on life, politics and about anything else he can put his mind into. You find yourself laughing outloud while realizing that the majority of the things he writes about are intelligent truths. Most chapters are worth reading over and over."
2,This book contains about 15 funny pages,"Once again Dennis Miller has written a book about his unfunny view of everything bad in the world. Even with all the writers that he had to get to help him, he still couldn't put it all together to form a book that is worth buying. It is good to get at the library, because once you read it you will be glad you didn't buy it."
2,Okay but structured,"Although Miller is at His satirical best;His structured delivery on every subject starts to get boring halfway through the book.He injects different celebrities in the same old spots and it becomes a mantra after awhile.'I dont want to rant but Dennis baby,find a new free form formula!"""
3,Not Bad - but not very good.,"Overall, I enjoyed reading this book. It had some funny parts which were worthy of reading, despite the annoying parts. What do I mean when I say ""annoying parts"" ? stuff like ""As for my computer skills, you know there hasn't bee anyone that ineffective at a keyboard since Susan Dey was in The Partridge Family."". I'm not sure who Susan Dey is, and I barely remember the Partridge Family. The point is, I think one of every 3-4 funny ""bits"" of the book refers to a name, or a show, or something. Nevermind that I don't know 80% of these names - it just stops being funny after the 3rd or 4th times. Anyway, Like I said before, it's funny despite the annoying parts."
4,Ranting is what he does Best.,"I got a kick out of this book as I do with most books written by stand-up comics. Dennis gives us his side of things which sometimes can be over bearing and a little too real but he's always funny, and makes you think. And why else would you buy his book unless you wanted a good laugh and a little satire.As serious as the world has become its nice to get a lighter, funnier side of things from a true funny guy that actually has a mind of his own and thinks with his head and his heart. Dennis is spot on, good book, funny."
4,"Dennis Miller, I love you!","Dennis Miller is either a love him or hate him kind of guy. I find his commentary brilliant and incisive. If you love his brand of humor, I would snap this book up. If you don't like him...go ahead; give him a try again...you know you want to!This is one of the few books that I consistantly laugh out loud while reading, but it does give you pause to think. (Those who say smoking won't kill you are lying through the hole in their trachea) I find that social commentary delivered with a good dose of humor often is the best way to make ones point without seeming preachy. Miller is the King of this arena. He definitely understands the workings of American society, warts and all, and can absolutely hit the nail on the head every time.This is a book that manages to deftly walk the fine line of making you think AND entertaining you."
3,"Funny, but unsatisfying","After reading ""Rants"", I thought that this book would be even better. Not true. While this is a worthwhile read, I would suggest reading ""Rants"" first. In this book, he uses a lot of the same jokes in different rants and they're just not as funny as the ones from the previous book."
5,Miller For President!,"Based on the evidence of both ""The Rants"" and ""Ranting Again,"" I believe Dennis Miller has what it takes to run this country: the ability to cut through the BS and bottom-line things in a brutal, funny and real way; a sense of humor, which is usually lacking in our elected officials; and, most important, the ability to entertain while presenting and discussing an opinion or an issue. (Listen to any typical political discourse and then think about it being punched up by someone who actually considers the listener's desire NOT to fall into a deep coma!) Maybe it's time to put all that phony polish away, toss out the self-serving blowhards and find a person who (Harry Truman, are you listening?) tells it like it is. . .or, at least, gives his opinion, though he could be wrong!"
3,Good but take your time with it.,"A decent effort by Dennis. The first book was better, but then again most sequals usually don't have the push that the original did. I have to say I agreed with about 90% of his rants, and if you loved him on SNL you'll like him here. But my advice to readers is treat the book as if you would his show; as you're watching the show once a week... read a rant once a week. He tends to make the same references over and over (like Luciano Pavoratti for instance) that one would miss when seeing him only once a week, but get bored of easily as you read rant after rant on a lazy sunday afternoon."
3,"Good, but not as good as The Rants","Overall, I liked this book although it wasn't as good as his first book: The Rants. It just wasn't as funny and it was too preachy. Just my opinion, I could be wrong. (Also, being from Pittsburgh is a good sign)"
5,Specacularly Humorous with a dash of realism,"To call this book hilarious is equivalent to telling Alanis Morrisette that she needs to be just a bit more filled with rage. Few comedians can use intelligent banter with their monologues, without reverting back to f*** jokes. Even fewer can include those jokes and make it funny. For the latter, Miller is the Einstien of the art. I look forward to reading his rants with continual enthusiasm. I even find his adept use of metaphor rubbing off on me (to the point of claiming that '...to call the justice department a circus is to insult bearded ladies & trapeze artists everywhere') Both the first and second editions of his rants are brilliant commentaries on where we are and how we got here. If there is a complaint, it's that the books aren't long enough and there are only two of them."
4,Excellent Reference for Tennis Conditioning,"Paul Roetert was formerly the Head of Sport Science for USTA Player Development in Key Biscayne. He has been instrumental in advancing US tennis scientifically and shows why here. This book was created for the tennis player and coach and perhaps is the best book on the market regarding conditioning for tennis (there are 3 or 4 other inferior books). For myself, I think it is a bit basic (a primer) and doesn't cover enough scientific applications and how to scientifically create a conditioning program. Anyhow, I think that is for the German DTB (e.g., look up Richard Schoenborn books). Otherwise, Paul and Todd (a top trainer) would limit their audience. The authors produce an excellent resource for most serious players perhaps applicable to all. This book should rank among the top ten tennis books written in the past decade."
5,Very cute,"I loved Mad About You- it was one of the wittiest most romantic shows on television. This book was a good substitute and was very entertaining to read.If you enjoyed Couplehood, you will like Babyhood as well. It was a very sweet rendering on a father's journey throughout his wife's pregnancy through raiding an infant. Reiser managed to be both witty and sweet.This was a fun, but thoughtful read!"
5,Brilliant Observations by a Gifted Comedian,"As Mr. Reiser states, this is not really a how-to guide on parenting but merely several observations he's made along the way. After recently having a baby (ok not so recent, I had time to read the book right???), I have noticed many similar occurences and found myself laughing out loud. The author touches on many universal subjects that are true to parents from around the world. It is a quick read and I definitely recommend it to all parents if you can find the time!"
4,"Light fare, but fun","I bought Reiser's Babyhood on a whim, when my husband and I began to talk seriously about having children. I found it amusing, at times moving, and occasionally, it really rang true for me: I certainly remember ""the power of a two inch paper stick,"" as I am now pregnant! I enjoyed reading bits to my husband as well. I find pregnancy wonderful - but weighty - after all, my life will change for always after the birth of our child. Books which treat pregnancy, childbirth and marriage with irreverance, humour and sheer silliness really help!! If you like Reiser's show, Mad About You, you will most likely really enjoy Babyhood - it is a fun counterpoint to the many weightier tomes on pregnancy and childbirth! (And you will find yourself buying at least one of these, as Reiser points out!)"
2,This book's large type made it much easier to read,"This book's large type made it much easier to read that the version printed with a more stingy type. The fact that Paul has the consideration to print something for our less-sighted bretheren shows the true nature of this sub-humanitarian, although the book itself is a tribute from his big heart to our less-intelligent bretheren. Also, maybe in large type the peculiar liverpudlian inflections are more easy to remember. Despite all of his work for the death star, this guy still has his finger on the throat of america and won't stop doing it until he's met all of our expectorations. It's sure sad about his wife; While they may once have said paul is dead, his wife is now. Maybe future pop scholars will label this book, Parenthood, as commedia before the purgatoria about Linda Hunt's timely demise. May I suggest I title? Ex-Husbandhood? And keep the large type for the next work because I like to read this bard's books in the dark."
3,"Funny, but not as engaging as I expected","I can't say that Paul Reiser's book on babies (making them and having them), ""Babyhood"", was bad or dull. On the contrary, it was quite funny and packed with thought-provoking comments that make you question some of your irrational behaviors as you're going through the stages of parenthood , both before and after birth. However, I expected a lot more humor from the star and producer of 'Mad About You', arguably one of the best comedy shows ever, along with 'Seinfeld'. On that level, I must recommend as an alternative (a non-stop laughter generator) the book ""Being a Dad: The Stuff No One Told Me"". I read it shortly before ""Babyhood"". Though not as deep as this one in some spots, I found it to be a lot funnier than Reiser's."
3,A RELAXING AND ENJOYABLE PIECE OF WORK,"Certainly not ""An out-loud laugh on everypage"", but you read it with a smile on your face. The book definetely increases your respect to your father, while making you think twice before having a child. It can offer you a pleasent evening after a very tired and excessively serious day."
5,Great book for new Dad,I needed a special gift for a new dad. This was a great idea. Highly recommend. Funny and lots of laughs.
2,Disappointing,"I loved Bob James's recording of the music of Jean-Philippe Rameau; it remains one of my favourite LPs and CDs. When I saw that he'd done the same with the music of Scarlatti, one of the greatest keyboard composers ever, I couldn't order it fast enough. And I'm really disappointed. All the same things - multiple instruments, different effects - are there. But the magic of the earlier recording is missing. I can't figure out why this should be. Is it that Scarlatti is less tolerant of the James treatment than Rameau? Was it an inappropriate choice of Scarlatti pieces for Jamesising? I don't know. All I know is that it just doesn't do it for me. Perhaps It will grow on me with time, but the Rameau hit me right away and the pleasure of that recording has stayed with me for over 20 years. I don't get it - in every sense."
2,"Standard 8.5""x11"" paper doesn't fit","The container doesn't hold standard 8.5"" x 11"" paper. I read the specs before buying which shows it has an 11"" width but when it arrived, there is an indent in the plastic that effectively makes the bin only 10"" wide and 10.25"" deep. So if you try to put standard paper in the bin, curls up at the ends. I have no problem with the durability -- appears to be made from sturdy plastic."
4,Great for all ages!,"I bought this book for my 13 year old because she has become interested in law, but I think my husband and I had more fun with it! Simple to read, easy to understand. Definately a good book for kids!"
4,Easy and Entertaining,"I am the Activities Director at a nursing facility, and I ordered this book for our resident Coffee Chat on Monday mornings. The residents and I had so much fun talking about the cases, and it also led to some memories and stories of their own. It was not only a great social exercise, but good for a cognitive activity as well. The cases weren't at all technical, but short, written in lay terms and easy for people who may have cognitive impairment to understand and enjoy. We had so much fun reading the verdicts in the back of the book after talking about the case, and either feeling justified or appalled. A great buy."
3,The first cartoon is too hard,"I put this book aside because the first cartoon in the book had words in it that were not defined in the accompanying word list. For me this cartoon book is at too advanced a level of German to be useful for a beginner like me. I recommend instead purchasing ""Michel Thomas German Language Builder"" on CD.This cartoon book in my opinion is not useful to anyone who has not had a least a full year of German instruction in a formal course of study."
3,Second best,"I am something of an OCR fanatic because I depend a lot on being able to digitize research material for compact storage and easy access. I began some years ago with TextBridge and looked forward to seeing what Scansoft had done in melding the features of TextBridge and OmniPage. The result was a big disappointment. The ability to make PDFs in one step is a major improvement but they ""lost"" one the features that I find most important -- automatic separation of a scan of two pages at once from a book into separate scan pages. And the recognition accuracy and flexibility doesn't even come close to the standards set by ABBYY FineReader 5.0 (or even the earlier versions of FR!).The one significant advantage of OP over FR is its ability to accept PDF files directly as inputs. Unless that is of overwhelming importance to you and your needs for recognition of complex material are modest, I would definitely skip OmniPage and get FineReader instead -- and save a bundle of money in the process."
3,Kaput after 15 months,"The heating element has broken after 15 months. This is not an inexpensive unit. I'm a Brit and my previous (UK) Russell Hobbs kettle lasted me for at least 11 years. Otherwise this is an attractive and reasonable product, but obviously corners have been cut. I should also mention that the handle makes it a little difficult to fill from our filtered water spiggot.Summary: Buy something else folks. Sorry Russell Hobbs."
4,Un très bon livre,"Un livre qui devrait faire partie de la bibliothèque de tout amateur de plantes à caudex! Beaucoup de photos très représentatives de ces plantes cultivées en pots ou conteneurs, des conseils de culture bien choisis. Au Jardin Naturel nous connaissons bien ce type de plantes et ce livre est un excellent outil pour que nous progressions dans le domaine.Thierry ALBERTO (baobabs.com)"
2,S.O.F. isn't very fun,"Okay I don't have the DC version of course. It isn't out yet. But I do have the PC version and it isn't very fun. Sure you blow heads off and there are gutts flying everywhere. But they truth is that there is no strategy behind the game. You just go around shooting. I like stratagy games like Metal Gear Solid though. But I am telling you this game isn't worth buying. It gets old really fast. It is exactly like DOOM except against humans and better graphics of course. But remember how DOOM was so awesome for the first 5, 6 maybe 7 days then it got really, well then you didn't play it anymore. Well that is how this game is. I haven't played it since the 1st day I got it. I recommend not buying this game!"
2,"slow,slow,slow","The game is fun to play until you play for 2 minutes and have to wait 5 minutes during load times to play some levels, not exaggerating!you falll asleep between missions, i would have given it a 4 if not for the load time, the load time is actually longer than the game."
4,"Clear, Effective, No Nonsense Guide","This is a good guide for conducting diagnostic interviews. It is easy to read and comprehend, and the format will be great for future reference. The authors give examples in the frequent ""Putting it into Practice"" boxes, as well as ""Rapid Reference"" boxes and ""Caution"" boxes. There is a chapter summary at the end of each chapter, and a chapter quiz one can take to make sure the highlights have been processed."
3,A little too basic,I bought this to use with my social work interns to teach them interviewing skills. I was disappointed because it is almost too basic. It doesn't provide practical applications and there is too much focus on how to get insurance reimbursement through proper assessments and documentation.
5,FANTASTIC!,I had this book as a kid and I am now 24 and ordered it for my son(he is only 6 months so I am just being prepared. When I got the book it was in immaculate condition. I am very happy with it :)
3,Not the best seal.,Used it in Mexico once. Couldn't really see much and it leaked. Comes with a nice case though. Maybe my head shape isn't the best for these goggles?
2,Not like they used to...,"I read a lot of these reviews and decided to go with the Speedo Sprint because they were always my favorite. After 1 week of swimming I can say that they are pretty close to the same level of comfort as the older versions. Unfortunately the setting for the neoprene gasket is smaller and some areas don't appear to be glued. The gasket is definately going to be the week part, we'll see how long they last.Pro:PriceClassic designeasy to adjustCon:neoprene gasket thinner/not glued as well.GASKET GLUE IS HORRIBLE>UPDATE: After only 2 weeks the right eye gasket is totally separated from the bottom. The glue is non-existant, the neoprene didn't tear or anything, just came off as if it was never glued on. They leak a little but I'm going to stick with them because I want to see how bad they are. Listen to the other reviews. These have been my favorite goggles for decades and now they are pretty worthless.My last pair lasted 4 years, this pair 2 weeks!!!!!!!"
3,There's a reason why they're cheap,After a few uses the black rubber padding on one side separated away...during a meet. I gorilla glued it back on and it seems ok. For now.
3,Not what they used to be =\,"They are under $10 and for that they are great. They last about 4-6 months with about 5 hours a week (so about 80-120 hours of use) which is not great but then again they are $10 goggles.The adjustable nose strap is fairly difficult to adjust in my opinion. The rubber straps hold fairly well.The weak point in the goggles is the rubber around the plastic piece. The foam and/or the glue that holds the foam attached to the plastic eye piece wears away, thereby leaking water. Anti fogging lasts only the first few swims with these. Afterwards, just give them a good lick before jumping and you should be fine."
3,Short-lived,"At first, I was REALLY happy with these goggles. They didn't give me headaches or bruises around my eyes like most other goggles tend to do, and they kept out water perfectly fine. However, it only took a few weeks (of swimming between 2-4 times a week) for them to start falling apart. The foam-y part started peeling away from the hard plastic, so they aren't very watertight anymore. I've still got them, as a backup pair, but they're not reliable enough for frequent use."
1,Racoon Eyes,These goggles leaked and they left dark circles around my eyes. As for the fogging a little coat of saliva on the goggles fixed the issue.
1,Foam on the back,It leaks a lot and if you wear it too tight it will give you raccoon eyes. not worth the trying. If they replace the foam padding with silicone gel or whatever comes with most other goggles I would consider buying it
5,great product for the price,"I've used this style for years now and have always been happy with them, they have fit me better than some of the pricier models out there."
2,"ok, not great","These goggles lack anti-fog coating. Ok what do expect for low price. But I also find them really uncomfotable. The suction cup thing that goes against your eye doesn't really bend that much it's like this flat piece of foam, (neoprene?) pressing against your whole head. The band is easy to adjust. They're usable. sort of. I do like the speedo vanquisher although I only tried them on a few times, they certainly didn't make me feel like tearing them off my face as these do. I wouldn't buy these again."
2,"Cheap and ok, but not worth the Speedo brand name","... I needed goggles urgently and got these ones. They were cheap, so I didn't expect too much. But still, they are speedos and I expected a somehow better rubber. Unless you wear them really tight, water will come in. Wearing them tight will make you some nice rings around the eyes...Whatever, the are probably ok for their price ..."
1,worthless,"I've owned many Speedo goggles and never had an issue.. well, these leak water unless you crank them tight on your head causing you to see double ..can't even tell when I'm coming up on a turn. Terrible product. They may fit some heads but not mine. Only problem I've ever had with a goggle. Terrible product."
5,A product that lasts and a great value,"These goggles are used 3 times per week. I have had and my original pair more than 2 years with no problems. I am still using them! I purchased 4 pair as I was afraid Speedo would discontinue this model.I bought the clear goggles as they are used inside in a swim spa. For that reason though, I can't comment on how durable they would be in a chlorine environment as I use bromine.The bridge of my nose is quite narrow and these goggles, unlike many others I have tried in over 61 years of swimming, have quite a wide range of adjustment to the point that I was able to be fit them to my nose and they could be made even narrower if necessary. This is he first time I have encountered such goggles. It may not sound like much but if they don't fit around the nose, they leak."
3,Not For Competition,These goggles are ok if you are an occasional swimmer with a smallish head. These kept popping off my big noggin and the strap is at its last little plastic holder. Looking for a two strap google with the adjustment in the rear now.
2,fog,the fit of these goggles is good but they fog ALL THE TIME! pay the extra money and get anti-fog goggles.
4,Good purchase,"For the price, it is actually a good purchase. Pros, personally, I like the rubber foam around the eyes' cover since it does not hurt the skin around my eyes, but at the same time, do a great job in preventing water from entering the eyes. I bought one in another shop and they use plastic around the eyes cover. After use it a while, I found it a bit uncomfortable since the plastic is rough and hard to the skin. Furthermore, the size of the goggle is just nice for me.While the cons, the strap is a bit difficult to adjust. Maybe I'm not used to it yet."
3,this style is ok for casual use,"I can't remember the style I wore back in H.S. water polo, those worked so well. This style is good for my casual use at the gym pool, home pool and shower { I have sensitive eyes,and SoCal water is harsh}. The strap doesn't adjust easily, and it fits a little too tightly, maybe it could use a different type of material, and a little more padding around the eye cups.Speedo is a quality brand and I would recommend one of the other styles they have over this one."
4,Entertaining,"Though I agree that the ""bridal consultant advertising"" was a touch excessive, I still found the book to be a lighthearted look at the realities of weddings. I used it in conjunction with other books and it was the only one that lifted my spirit at a time when even happy things become slightly traumatic. This books has done the rounds amongst my friends and family who have gotten married and they all loved it."
2,An Ok Book,I found this book to be a lot of common sense without a lot of fresh ideas. The author is from Indiana and constantly sites examples from that part of the country which didn't help me at all. The constant plugs to hire a bridal consultant become tiresome. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you didn't have a clue about the wedding process.
1,Too narrow minded,"The author spoke only from her point of view, which was Midwestern and Christian. She devoted a huge section to church weddings, and a tiny section for any other kind, which did not help me at all. Also, she kept talking about NOT having a wedding outdoors, which doesn't make any nature-loving bride happy, nor does it give a California bride tips on planning her outdoor wedding. Thirdly, this book doesn't include many ethnic or cultural tips and traditions (except for the tiny part on the Jewish wedding). Try the Unoffical Guide to planning your Wedding or the Dummies book instead."
5,"A Home Without a Father: Raped, Abandoned, Shamed...a Life",This book was captivating; easy to read; hit all the emotions; and left you inspired and thankful for what has happened with your own journey in life. Makes you realize that there is so much more to do with your life and such a short time to do it!
5,A retrofuture gem!,"Remember the Seinfeld episode when Jerry and George reflect on their disappointment that flying cars have yet to appear? Well, the Revillos hark back to that era--they are the hardcore alternative to Jet Screamer in the Jetsons pop universe. Imagine the B-52s OD'd on steroids and amphetamines--they're THAT good! Fantastic pop-rock masterpieces played in Hyperdrive, and the bonus tracks are wonderful. Bitchin' guitars, drums, and boy-girl vocals. Did I mention that it's recorded in SnatzoSound? Get REVVED UP!!!"
5,Finally - THE CD!!!,"After wearing out my Rev Up on vinyl years ago, it's good to see the re-release of this priceless ode to bouncy mid-sixties ""beat"" bands. Ignore the detractors who don't understand the context or historicity of this album. This is the real deal. A band tighter and more energetic than rock has experienced in 20 years!!! Although this album was frequently compared to the prior released B-52's first album, there really is no comparison. The Revillos can play the B-52's under the rug."
2,Dissapointing,"I first heard this album last year. I was very disappointed. This was the plundering of Re(z)illos. It's too bad Rezillos couldn't reproduce the greatness of Can't Stand the Rezillos, which has been a fave of mine for a couple of years. I haven't been a fan-boy about this record, it is just obviously sup-par. Avoid Revillos with a V. Viva la Rezillos! (with a Z.)"
3,Corny or Not,"20 Years later the music of Ratt holds up well, but in real life every cliche for being cool, that is really corny."
3,OK OK OK,This album has two really good songs in Round & Round and Lay It Down. Other then that there is not much here. Just another band that really couldn't hack it in the big leagues. Not recomended but not bad.
5,Perfect travel case!,"I picked this up with a Rogue RM-100A Mandolin. It fits it perfectly. I already had the Baritone Ukulele model of this case, and have always been more than happy. This case is no different. Lightweight, sturdy, plenty of storage for your books, tuners, and other gear. Perfect for traveling with your Mandolin. I would recommend this to anyone looking to travel with their axe. Not as heavy as a hardshell case, but not as weak as gig bag. Yet it offers all the protection you need, and more. The best of both worlds."
3,Hot Spring Fizzel,This book is old. I haven't had a chance to see if the hot springs listed are even still there.
5,Weiss offers more than you think,"After reading ""Many Lifes, Many Masters"" and ""Messages from the Master"" many years ago, I use to think that Dr. Brian Weiss didn't have anymore to offer to my spiritual growth. But I was wrong. I widely recommend this book."
2,"This is a joke, right?","He's exhausted the topic of Regression and has now started on Progression. There is even a chapter touching on Aliens, so you can see where the next book is going to go!He's having a laugh, isn't he? Mind you, the joke is on us for buying the books."
1,Shame on him!,"Brian Weiss yet again tries to convince his readers that his stories are real. I am sorry he has to go to such lengths just to publish a book. His advice is the same no matter how many books he writes.For a creative story with average writing, this is your book!"
5,"wonderful, uplifting exercises to practice","This book has many wonderful, uplifting exercises to help you along on your journey toward a fulfilling life. I always find Dr. Weiss' books fascinating as he delves into precognitive dreams and lives yet to be shaped or lived. Once we realized and accept all have the free will to create our destiny, our lives are totally within our control. Elaine Williams, author A Journey Well Taken: Life After Loss."
4,making you think,"I thought that the book was very interesting to read, and it made you stop and think about your life and lives you come in contact with. Some of the stories were outside of my belief and thought pattern. I have a lot of respect for the author."
2,Money not well spent...,"I picked up a copy because I had read his others many years ago and they were somewhat interesting.I think he probably needs money and so wrote another book under the pretense of having advanced his theories and techniques. But, clearly, this guy is no Michael Newton."
3,benjamin franklin,This book is interesting it has a lot of information and a lot of details thats why i give this book three stars
4,pretty funny movie,"i never saw the original but i thought i would rent this cause i was in the mood for a comedy, and this wasnt too bad. its your basic bachelor party type movie where a group of guys go on a wild adventure and this one has a little twist mixed in. its not the funniest movie but i laughed at some parts. harland williams is what made this movie funny, without him it would have been a 2 or 3 star. if your looking for a silly comedy with some good nudity and some laughs then rent this."
2,Far from Original,"Sometimes actors from old movies will appear in cameos to bless the re-make. Tom Hanks is nowhere near here. This has very little to do with the first movie; it doesn't say what happened the next day or next year. This work involves four horny guys, but they don't have the chemistry and appeal of the four men in ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin."" This is full of predictible jokes and gags. Honestly, I've matured since seeing ""Bachelor Party 1,"" so there's a chance that young guys may like this one as much as I liked the first one. Still, I found this underwhelming and a bit long, the only good part was the occasional coverage of male nudity. Also, an actor named Danny Jacobs had an awesome chin dimple and hairy chest."
4,great garden shears,"these pruning shears are very easy to use, makes cutting roses etc a real joy. and they're pink, easy to spot in the garden"
3,It's okay....,It was heavier than I thought. I've used the orange and the offwhite models of saboten shears before. I guess this one is supposed to be heavy duty. The yellow and pink color stands out amongst all the shears my coworkers use at the flowershop.
2,Are the Cliff's Notes available?,"Who edits these books? Arrggh! There is plenty of good information here, but who has the time to extract the useful stuff? Maybe I'll look into the audio version."
5,Excelent,"The purchase process was fast and easy with the memory selection tool. The memory arrived on schedule, well packaged and the installation resulted in a good speed improvement on my laptop."
3,joe leste missing key factors of band,"This band was one of the best bands ever in it's prime,late 80's early 90's. Bang Tango still is one of my favorite bands. joe's voice one of a kind, raw soulful punk. Ready to go often misses on the key points that made Bang Tango what is was, The slappy funky punk bass line is no where to be found. The raspy punk vocals are traded in for more convention gen. glam-metal screaches. Even Dizy Reed playing piano on a couple of tracks only helps a little bit. This album is a poor attempt of a recreation of a great band. Joe's attempt to keep nastaliga alive sounds more like a cheesy way to capitolize on a name and make a few bucks."
4,They Are Still Better Than Most Of The Others,"Why this band didn't make it and hold their ground after the 80's backlash is beyond me. They were never a typical ""Hair Band"" and the bass that they had was monstrous.Now this cd doesn't have the funk anymore but this is solid Rock. No flash, no grunge, no alt/nu metal. It's just straight up rock in the vein of AC/DC and GnR. It has two weak tracks that I could have lived without but then I would have complained it was too short. So I will live.If you liked them in the past and you still like strong rock or love to play air guitar, well then pick this up. This is a very solid release that doesn't scream has beens like many returns that you hear today.This cd is as good as Velvet Revolver or Brides of Destruction."
5,rare gem of an album,"an indie album produced in 1996 by the band itself on a $ 2500 budget.very original cloth cover using tie-die cloth from swaziland makes each cd a collectors itemthe music itself is edgy trip hop from an electic group of individuals that met in cape town, south africait is their debut album that captures the band at its rawest and most desparatethis comes through in a recording that has brilliant songwriting by the entire bandone of those bands that should have gone somewhere...where ever there is!"
3,Good but Not Great,"This product is pretty reliable and works good, but getting it to work properly all of the time and to respond to everything is a bit tough. It takes a lot of time and patience."
1,I wish.....,I wish you have included a list of the songs of the CD and have some samples to listen before deciding whether to purchase it or not. I have just bought 3 Zydeco's CDs for my dad's 85th birthday in March next year. And I am ordering the Mardi Gras in New Orleans 2 as well as the Mardi Gras Essentials after listen to some of the samples. I like the songs - they will surely entertain the guests as well as my dad. I am preparing a Mardi Gras theme for my dad's birthday party.
3,"Good, but not real original.","While not very old, the style is more along the lines of the older ""Slayers"", which is what it seems to be trying to copy. It is watchable, but parents should be aware that unlike slayers there are adult situations and some fan service. While not really bloody, there is a fair bit of violence.The story is about a team of sorcerer hunters working for a supernatural entity called ""Big Mama"". It has some good points and develops a story line, including some character development, but not as much as it could. Some of the characters are developed more while others get less attention. If you're in the mood for something with serious moments in the middle of a comedy, and aren't looking to think too much, this is a good series.Overall I liked it, but unlike most I've recently picked up, I haven't bothered to go back and watch it again. (I usually at least watch each once dubbed and once subbed).Not really disappointing, but not outstanding either."
5,Wonderful Answers!,"I am a college student that has written MANY research papers on the Columbine tragedy. I had heard Brooks Brown mentioned before, and had read a few other limited books on the topic written by the parents of victims. However, at a professor's recommendation, I purchased this book, and found in it one of the best resources for the tragedy. It does not try to glorify the tragedy, nor does it present it from an outsider's view. This book presents one of the most tragic, interesting tales of one person's struggle with not only being bullied in high school, but dealing with the consequences of being friends with Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. So I offer my sincerest thank you to you, Brooks, for writing such a poignant look into the tragedy at Columbine High School."
3,Missing info,"The Truth . . . connects reptitious points with clunky prose, yet is so compelling I finished it in one afternoon. Brooks Brown seems to tell every story several times and still leaves big gaps in his account of life at Columbine before the incident. I never got a clear picture of what it was that pushed Harris and Klebold from sharing day dreams of revenge to executing mass murder."
1,"Given the reviews here, disappointing","I turned to this book as possible first-hand source material for a seminar on violence and enculturation in modern America. What did I come away with? A whining, immature rant about how things aren't ""his fault"". Society made them do it. Instead of the lucid expose that so many of these reviews promise, this book presents us with a whining, tattling exercise that does no service to anyone or anything, and serves only to feed the self-serving desires of the author.The prose is itself slang-ridden and nearly impossible to read. One wonders whether this is the work of the co-author, trying to make the piece seem edgy and relevant. It ultimately acts only as an off-putting, succeeding in alienating the reader, making it difficult for us to form a closeness: though we might wish to. A tragedy such as this is deserving of a far better voice than is provided by this book."
1,There must be better accounts,"Brown's work is nothing save self-serving, poorly written, half-thought out tripe: I would call it pablum for the masses, save that this seems to overstate the value of the work. There is naught of value here. This marks nothing more, or less, than a voyeuristic/self-indulgent (depending, of course, upon one's point of readership) excursis upon a tragedy. Brown does no service to the memories of those whose lives were senselessly disrupted. Much of his writing is spiteful, presenting himself as a figure of authority, qualified to comment upon the role of violence in modern American society.What credentials does the author present? This I ask..."
3,"Brooks, Brooks, Brooks.....","While I believe the story itself is compelling and sad, my chief thoughts while reading this book is that Brooks Brown is a whiner, a tattler, and above all a huge attention seeker. He brought a lot of the stuff pertaining to him on himself. I found the book almost tedious, even though I agree with Brooks' thoughts that Columbine and society CREATED those boys, not music lyrics and video games. Still a good look into the facts of the case if you can get past Mr. Brown's attention seeking."
3,First hand account on the killers,"I find the writings to be to the point. Brown's first hand account of growing up with the killers provides a great insight. I could'nt help to think that Brown was motivated to write this for attention with something to prove. I could'nt help to feel that Brown was whining, making the book too bias. He references in the beginning of the book that video game violence had played no influence in the killings. He later refers that one of the killers settles into their own reality of playing video games, because it was the only thing they knew. He refers in the book that the brutal act resembled levels in the video game Doom. This discounted Brown on his previous statement that video games played no influence in the killings. In a whole I felt that it was okay, but unfinished."
5,Best Columbine book ever made,All I want to say that brooks brown knew Eric and Dylan well and he had feuds with eric and such this is what make's it a good read I am going to put this on my best books list but anyway its about growing up with them knowing them happy times and bad times and at the end of book very political. Brooks brown deftly has tanlent at writing trust me you won't put it down
5,An Excellect Book !!!!!,I highly recommend this book. It was just excellent.I could not put it down. Definitely a must read.Thank You Brooks!!
2,No a true account of what happened inside,"If you're looking for a book that goes in-depth about what happened inside the school and how events occured, this is not the book for you. This book details the relationship of a friend of Dyland and Eric's. It is his account of what happened (he was not actually there at the school, he had already left), His relationship with Dylan and Eric before the shoting, what he felt and what he has gone through since.Not your typical ""true crime"" type novel with details of events that happened."
4,Very interesting read,I really enjoyed this book. Brooks Brown tells about the experiances he had when he was friends with Harris and Klebold. He also explains what led up to the killings and the signs that the killer's displayed that were missed by their parents and friends. It was also a very easy read and simple to understand. I have had the book 3 months and have read it several times. I highly recommened this book to anyone that wants information on who Eric and Dylan were from someone who knew them best.
4,No Easy Answers: The Truth Behind Columbine,This was a very interesting account by a young man who had some insights that few have of this most tragic event in our history. As a school administrator it was a wake-up call.
1,Doesn't work - yet,"I have been unsuccesfull in getting this item to work. My computer states that it can accept up to 1 gig of memory but when I install this, my computer will not work properly. I even updated the bios because I read that sometimes newer memory isn't manufactured the same way as the stuff that came with it even though it's technically the same type of memory(SODIMM). Not sure what to do now because it's been so long since I first bought the memory that I don't think I can return it. If I could just test the memory in another computer to verify that the memory is actually the problem...that would be great but I haven't been able to get my hands on the same type of computer that uses this style of memorey."
2,I can't believe I am saying this...,I am a staunch Julie Garwood fan but I did not like this at all! It was so stilted and I could never quite get caught up in the romance or the suspense - not thrilling at all. I have it bookmarked in my Kindle (I'm 70% done) and haven't been bored or listless enough to go back and finish it up which is quite unlike me. I remain very surprised at this.I would definitely recommend Julie Garwood (I have some favorites by her - Honor's Splendor and Prince Charming) but perhaps not this genre. Because I love her so much I'll try another as the description for this book lists this as her first romantic thriller.
3,Story didn't work,"This is my second book from this author. My first was ""Honor's Splendour"", a historic romance novel, which I really loved. Garwood managed masterfully to describe her main characters and convey excellently the medieval atmosphere.However, nothing like this was achieved in ""Heartbreaker"". My feelings concerning this book are very mixed. There were good moments and I sometimes even smiled at the one or the other verbal attack. But the story never really ""took off"". Maybe this was because the ""chemistry"" between Nick and Laurant didn't really work? Maybe the story line was just poor and badly elaborated? I can't put my finger on it; in any case it just didn't work out for me."
2,Whatever happened to Julie Garwood?,"All my Garwoods are spotted with pool water, bath water and coffee. My daughters and I love these comfort books--they probably have calories. The three of us have shared some hilarious Garwood book reviews. OK, it's not the Bible or even Shakespeare, but Julie is our best friend; we know what to expect. We're not quite sure just what it is about Garwood's medieval Scotland that hits the spot but it really does; no man could ever understand.Heartbreaker is a departure -- a stalker story that Grisham and others have done already, and much better. The characters are mere sketches. We know that Julie can make her people quite real (at least until the story is over). Heartbreaker's Laurent is not believable or lovable. Nick would be much better in a kilt. If there was humor tucked in there, I must have missed it. Better luck next time."
3,A change for Garwood,"I have two copies of all her Julie Garwoods books, this will be the first one that I do not get a second copy of, and if I had known ahead of time I would have waited for the paperback. The writing is good, her style aparent, however, I wanted to read a romance, not a thriller. Many romance authors seem to jump ship and leave readers who adored them behind. I hope that Ms. Garwood does not plan on this in the future, as she is my favorite author. The storyline is based on a seriel killer who is stalking a single woman, Laurant. He tells her brother, a priest, what he is doing. Laurants brother calls in his FBI friend, Nick, to protect his sister. Although there is an attraction between the two, there is not enough play in the book with it to become entranced. There is also a lot of time spent on the killers thoughts, more than I wanted to know... So, needless to say, I was disappointed, however, I am anxiously waiting,(fingers crossed) for her next book."
3,Dissapointed in the master...,"My friends and I have been addicted to Garwood's books since high school, and considering the frequency with which she publishes them (that is at a snail's pace compared to some other romance novelists) I was incredibly excited to read this new story... and rather dissapointed when it was over. This is not the witty, organized, insightful Garwood of old. Where was the developing romance? Where was the humor? Where was the, well, interesting, imaginitive and compelling story? This book did nothing but frustrate me and I felt that the ending did in fact conflict with some of the information she leaked about the ""Heartbreaker"" earlier on in the book. All in all, not her best effort by far. And P.S. - when someone checks something on the internet (such as a page that teaches you how to make bombs, as her psychopathic killer does), it is called a web ""site"" NOT ""sight"" as was written in the novel. Sorry..."
2,disappointed,"When I read a Julie Garwood novel, I expect strong, believable, and admirable characters. I also expect the characters to be be interesting and unique. With Heartbreaker, I thought that the characters were not any of these things. The dialogue was typical rather than using her usual wit, and the characters were trite. This could be because I usually read a lot of contemporary suspense novels and I was sad that my favorite historical writer gave up on the genre. For whatever reason, unlike all of her other novels (I particularly recommend Honor's Splendour), I was not gripped or entertained."
3,Good but not that good,"I'm a newcomer to Julie Garwood, and though this book will lead me to pick up others books by her, I don't think it was all that good of a book. You have the romance aspect, no doubt about it. Laurant and Nick are a nice little couple, Nick was definitly fun to read about. However, I picked the book because the blurbs hyped it up to be a ""...good thriller."" The thrill aspect of the book was horribly shadowed by the romance aspect. The investigation... well wait, what investigation? You didn't get any of the police work, crime scene evaluations, or even the profiler that was introduced disappeared before literally revealing anything. So if you like romance stories, pick it up, it's worth the read, but I suggest renting it from the library and saving your 8 bucks."
3,Just couldn't get into it,"Like so many others, I am a huge Julie Garwood fan. I have read all but three of her historicals and absolutely love them. I was not expecting the humor and light hearted feeling that most of her historicals have, but I was still a little disappointed. I have read several suspense thrillers that left me on the edge of my seat and kept me guessing, but I didn't really feel that way about this one. Something about the pacing just messed it up for me. I felt like it started off a little slow for some reason. Too much descriptions as the first made me want to skim to get to the action. For whatever reason, I never really clicked with the heroine either. She was likable enough ,but she doesn't stand out. I felt blah about the whole thing. Even the villian was not that memerable.I read this JG book to appease my curiosity about her contemporary books. Now that I know, I will probably leave the rest alone and hold out hope for another historical."
5,One Hell of a Read,"This novel has excellent characters and provides a thrilling mix of holiness and evil. Page turning suspense and hot sexual attraction between Laurant, the target of a mad man, and her big brother's best friend, Nick, an FBI agent dedicated to protecting her, adds spice.Other characters are introduced, Noah and Theo, who you'll want to spend more time with. I'm looking forward to reading MERCY.Shelley Dawn, author of,Sweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights. [...]"
2,Heartbreaker....,"This book was not a good romance novel at all. This is the story of Nick, the FBI agent who has been called in to help protect his best friend's sister from a killer. I won't go more into the plot because it has already been discussed by the other reviewers. My issues with this book was that it dragged on and on with useless information. There were so many stories and information given that went absolutely no where. It would have been better if some of the fluff was left out to focus more on the relationship between the hero and heroine. Their romantic connection was none existent. You could fit all of the romantic interactions between the couple on 2 pages. As a mystery, I guess it was okay. But I expected a Romance and there was very little of that."
2,A Real Heartbreaker,"I bought this book believing that it would be another sure thing by Julie Garwood. It was a sad disappointment. I'm not sure exactly what happened with character development, but I didn't feel that I knew these characters until more than half of the book was done. I normally read this author's books in one sitting. I found myself putting this one down again and again. I'm looking forward to the next one, but probably will wait for the paperback."
2,"Unmoving romance and iffy plot; stick with ""Mercy""","The romance just didn't feel that real to me, and the big twists were just too unrealistic and implausible. Predictable killer as well. ""Mercy"" was much better."
2,Not up to snuff,"Being a very good fan of Julie Garwood, I was very disappointed in this novel. It's taking romance and blending it with mystery and detection (and what's supposed to be thrill) and not doing it well. If you have an inclination to blend romance and thrillers, try reading Nora Roberts or books under her pseudonym JD Robb. They are excellent. This book reminds me of those old mystery books that give you diverting clues and then spring on an ending that none of the previous 150 pages supports. Try her strickly romance...they're good."
3,Why the change?,"Was quite disappointed with the change in genre. Having three copies of ALL her other books (I do love her), I regret to say this will be the only copy of this book that I will own. PLEASE go back to the historicals...they made me laugh, cry and totally fall in love with the characters...This one however, did not do any of those. Although a good storyline, I guessed the villan quickly. I reserved this book months in advance in Hard Copy, and was so disappointed, I should have waited for the paperbook...It wasn't worth the additional money. Sorry..."
2,Disappointed,"If your thinking of reading a julie garwood book I would recommend any book other than this one. I've read all of Julie Garwoods books and this book is not one of her bests. What i love most about her books is that they can make you laugh out loud, cry, and feel every emotion that the character is feeling. She has a historical suspense book called The Bride, which is way better."
2,Disappointing contemporary debut,"I eagerly awaited Ms. Garwood's contemporary debut, but have to say that I was disappointed. Neither the hero nor the heroine are endearing -- they are both caricatures with no personality to complete them. Frankly, Father Tom and Noah were the most interesting characters and they weren't around enough to keep the plot from dragging.I can't put a finger on exactly what went wrong -- the book opened well. But there were too many pages spent on subplots that weren't really relevant and characters (like the FBI guy in charge) whose presence was useless as a plot device.I'd steer clear of ""Heartbreaker"" until released in paperback, or read it at the library."
3,TOO BAADD,"I was disappointed by this novel. I have enjoyed all of Ms Garwood's other books, but this one just did'nt do it for me. Somehow though her female characters are interesting in period novels this one was not believable nor was the romance. I was more interested in the hero's friend than I was the hero although his fear of flight was a nice touch."
2,Story Drags on Too Much!,"Although Julie Garwood's plot for Heartbreaker is very good; her writing defeats the entire concept because the story just drags on and on way too much. As I was reading, I kept thinking, ""Get to the point!"". The way the story is written, she could have said it all in 50 pages instead of over-describing every minute detail.I finally just gave up and skipped to the section that told who the creep was, which I had guessed early on anyway.Another disappointment with her style of writing is that her characters have flat personalities, they are like cardboard cutouts - they have no depth. It's as though she stands back and watches them and never really gets inside of their emotions. She doesn't allow the reader to feel anything. Laurent was asked if she was scared, she just answers, ""Yes, I'm scared."". . . and nothing more, there is no indepth description of how she feels. Very boring."
3,could have been a lot better,"This book had an ingenious concept but the book failed to be the quality I expected it would. It was slow-paced and dragged on at parts. I never felt that the characters were actually in any danger. This was a romance novel in disguise. The characters and their love scenes were straight out of a cheesy Harlequinn romance novel.The identity of Heartbreaker was a surprise though and the book was just interesting enough that I didn't throw it down in frustration. However, I would NOT read another novel by Julie Garwood."
4,"Chilling, Heart pounding read!","This was the first book by Julie Garwood that I had read. I was surprised to find that the book was not all sappy romance, but a total page turner. There is a nice warm connection between Nick and Laurant that takes care of the romance side....overall this book is a great read and I am hooked on Julie Garwood because of it!"
3,Could have been great,It started out great...but my interest faded three quarters of the way through. I mean you just new what was going to happen.More surprises needed...more suspense...this was to predictable.
2,Just okay,"I had heard good things about Julie Garwood, so I looked forward to this book. What a disappointment! The story is obvious, and Laurant and Nick are cardboard characters. They have no chemistry, yet we're supposed to believe there's this love between them that they have to fight to resist. Plus, the use of cliches is distracting - at one point, she stated Nick ""had the body of a Greek god"" and a few minutes later when Laurant tried to seduce him, Nick ""looked like a deer caught in the headlights."" For some reason, I kept picturing a Greek god caught in the headlights. And the humor with the old ladies fell awfully flat. I heard her historical romances are better, so maybe I'll try that. And the FBI in this book seemed awfully unprofessional.Finally, the ""false suspects"" - the property buyer who was foaming with rage and the kid who flattened the tires, were so obviously false as suspects they seemed ludicrous."
2,Not a page turner for me,"This is the first book that I have read by Julie Garwood. I purchased it after seeing how many reviews it had and looking at the overall star rating. I wish I had looked a bit further at the lower star rating reviews.I did not find this to be a ""real page turner"" or one that I simply ""could not put down"", but instead I found myself bored with the characters and the slow moving story line. It took about fifty pages for the story to really get going. I just had a difficult time engaging in the story or caring about the characters. I didn't ""feel""the chemistry between Laurent and Nick. I did like the author's description of Kansas City (State Line Road and Ward Parkway) it was just as I remembered it from years ago.Will I read another book by this author? Yes. I am going to give ""Ransom"" a try. Hopefully I will like it better."
1,Not Good,"bought this thinking it would be as good as the historicals. not even close! I will not waste my money or time on these books again. where was the deep attraction, the sizzle between the h/h? Very little went on romance wise. I won't waste time or more money on her modern stories. Go back to the writing of historical. Should have stayed with what works."
3,Half Way,"I have long enjoyed Julie Garwood's stories, however, this one was my least favorite. I liked the male character, he was interesting and enjoyable. I did not at all like the female character. . . she was too perfect. She had no idiosynchrencies, no foibles, nothing. She was bland, perfect mush, that I could not relate to."
3,Not quite her usual caliber,"I have been eagerly awaiting Julie Garwood's new book, Heartbreaker. I have always been a big fan of her work. However I found that I did not enjoy her latest, Heartbreaker, as much as her other books. I was expecting that this would have the same tender, funny chemistry between Laurant and Nick that is so characteristic of Julie Garwood's books. Instead the relationship seemed to be contrived and a little rushed and missed the magic she normally puts into her books. The story focused more on the mystery aspect of the story instead of interaction between Laurant and Nick. Overall I would say that this is one of my least favorite books by Julie Garwood."
1,Very Disapointing,"I was looking foward to reading this book since I heard it was coming out. When I finaly got it and read it I was very disapointed. I found Nick and Laurant's relationship taking a back seat to the ""murder mistery"" wich I found lacking. Their relationship never takes of until the end and by then you have skipped so many boring pages that all you want for the book to end. Don't take me wrong the book is good if you are not expecting a romance novel, wich in my opinion this is not. I found their relationship stale and missing that all important spark of passion. Laurant, I found, to be a one dimensional character never having any deph, never growing. Nick was missing that air of power and sensuality that most of Julie Garwood's male characters have. I have read all of Julie Garwood's books and this sadly is one I'm not re-reading."
5,Awesome!!!,"This is the first time I've read this author because I don't read historical romances. But once she ventured in to one of my favorite areas, romantic suspense, she hooked me. She did a wonderful job...this book is really good. I couldn't stop reading and did not want it to end. I love the bits of humor she interjected now and then. Her characters were so likable, with the exception of the killer of course. She did a good job of making him scary. My favorite was Nick. You could feel his strength and vulnerability at the same time. I would love to read a sequel. Maybe one centered around Noah, and give us an update on veryone from this novel. I'm sure if you are a fan of Ms Garwood, you will not be disappointed with this novel. If she continues to write contemporary romantic suspense, she has a fan in me. I highly recommend ""Heartbreaker""."
5,Garwood takes the high road and travels it with flash & dash,"What? Julie Garwood's ""Heartbreaker"" is a contemporary romance/mystery? My words when I discovered my favorite writer was stepping out of the mold I associated with her of dark, brooding Earls and fair, fancy Ladies! My next sentence was a half-hearted.....""Okay, I'll lay down my money and give it a shot"". Thank goodness I did or I'd have missed out on my favorite Garwood book to date!Her characters, Nick and Laurant jump at your from the pages...and fill your imagination with fanciful thoughts of actually knowing them along with Laurant's brother, Father Tom and the exciting Noah Clayborne (please let there be a book on Noah...please, please, please?).Oh, did I mention the psycho that has designs on Larant....as his next victim? The plot is so intricatly woven by Garwood you'll drive yourself nuts trying to figure out who the ""Heartbreaker"" is. Great read! Can't wait for her next book....I'm betting it's a sequel to this one."
2,"Okay, but not her best","I have been a fan of Julie's for many years, but I must admit, I was also disappointed by this book. Although the plot around the killer was very good, something was missing in the love story between the two main characters. Another novel of Garwood's with a good plot, but with character connection is ""Saving Grace"" or ""The Lyon's Lady."" Either one of those would be a better start to see what Julie is about then this new work. Sorry Julie."
1,Another sadistic killer,"I mean, what is up? I enjoy Julie Garwood's books, or at least, used to enjoy them. Her last few books have been an extreme disappointment and this one clinched it for. It's very unbelievable. I find the love that ""blossomed"" between Laurant and Nick so unrealistic; the descriptions and dialogue were juvenile....this one isn't even worth borrowing at a library. A total waste of time. I don't know about you fellow readers, but reading about sadistic killers brutalizing women isn't my cuppa tea."
3,Not too bad for first comtemporary novel.,"For Julie Garwood's first comtemporary novel, this is not too bad. I will definately give her her props for taking that step for change. I'm sure with a little more confidence, J.G.'s natural ability for writing very good books will be more profound in the following comtemporary books to come. (I do enjoy the historical novels the best.) I did notice a similarity to John Sanford's character, Lucas Davenport in the Prey series, to that of Nick. (For those readers who are not familiar with the lead character, Lucas Davenport, in the Prey Series, Nick's ""terrified of flying"" behaviors mirrored that of Lucas Davenport). I adore reading Julie Garwood and can't wait for her books to be published. Although this book is not up-to-par with her earlier releases, I don't think J.G. derserves a hard slam for her attempt in trying something new. Julie, keep of the good work."
1,"Where oh,Where did our Julie Garwood go?...","Okay, I am probably the first person to try to sell someone on Julie Garwood, but this book was really disappointing. The last couple of books she has written make me think Julie wrote the first couple chapters and then handed it over to someone else to finish. Where is her style? Normally, when you finish one of her book you feel like you just took a deep breath and you just feel better about life. She really makes you believe that true love, respect and committment can still be found in marriage.For this book, everything was very loose and you never really get a real romance between Nick and Laurent. The story line was unbelievable and just not her forte.Julie...Please do us a big favor...We love you, go back and write the type of books that only you can write...About Love and Hope and the beleif that happily ever after can really exist."
5,The best one yet!,I started to read this wonderful book on Wed. morning and found I couldn't put it down. I just had to finish it that day! I think this one is Ms. Garwood best yet. I always find her books intelligent and very hard to put down once you sart reading them.
4,Good suspense,"A good suspenseful book, a change of pace for Garwood, I LOVE how she brought a Claybourne back in this book, I'd love to see a book about him."
4,Pretty Good,"I like this book. It was worth the price (I got it 40% off and autographed!), but I did have a few minor problems with the book. I thought the plot about the killer was well written, but I would have preferred more romance. Garwood is still a dependable writer and I look forward to any more contemporary novels she might write. There are quite a few sequals she could write from this book alone (Noah, Nick's brothers etc.) I would recommend reading this book, but don't expect it to be very similar to her other books."
2,Not Julie Garwood,"i'm sorry...what were we reading again!? A romance, suspense, murder mystery thriller...what?!? because i couldnt tell from the book!I love julie garwood. I've read every one of her books. I have every one of her historicals. This one was a major disappointment. While the plot seemed interesting, i didnt feel the characters were so developed nor the story line. Nick, the FBI agent was supposed to take care of the herione and also fall in love with her in the meantime. He did the first well enough but the other part, im not too sure. Anyway if you're thinking of picking this one up because its written by Garwood, dont! It'll only upset you. If you've never read a Garwood before and want to try this out, stop and pick one of her historicals like The Prize, Honor's Splendour, The Bride etc."
5,Truly a Garwood Fan,"Heartbreaker was by far one of the best books I have ever read. The characters backgrounds keep you interested. This book had everything I look for in a book (intrigue, romance, great plot). This book is a must read for any Garwood, Nora Roberts, or Sandra Brown fan. Couldn't put it down."
1,oh my goooshhhhh..,"this is sooo predictable that I guessed - correctly - the murderer by chapter 2. the author's prose and style of writing just gave away too much and it felt rather draggy instead of moving the plot along. Too much character development is crammed into the pages when the characters are introduced. I also did not have any motivation of continuing with the book after discovering the murderer and it wasn't that tough to begin with. Just put the first and 2nd chapters together, tweak your brain cells a little and you will get ur murderer."
1,Heartbreak High,"I have never read Julie Garwood before, in fact I didn't read her now, I listened to the audiotape during my commute to and from work. A mystery or suspense thriller usually makes good company. I wasn't necessarily expecting a literary masterpiece, but the description of the story, written by a ""New York Times bestselling"" author sounded worth a try.It turned out to be ""trying"" at best. Longer than most 10th grade writing assignments, but hardly more sophisticated, the novel was at times excruciating to listen to. Predictable? Yes.Wooden? Like an oak. The heroine and hero were Barbie and Ken, but less dimensional. Paper cutouts with dialogue supplied by a 14 year old who has watched primetime often enough to get the sex scene down is more like it.The only good thing about the book is the hope that it should give to all unpublished novelists--if they wasted paper on this...we could get our grocery lists published!"
1,DISPLEASED WITH AMAZON,"I AM VERY DISPLEASED WITH AMAZON. 2 TIMES NOW I HAVE SENT FOR BOOKS, I SENT FOR UNABRIDGED BOOKS AND BOTH TIMES I HAVE GOTTEN ABRIDGED BOOKS WHY WOULD ANYONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND SEND FOR A HALF BOOK?"
1,Boring,"I had just finished Saving Grace, which I really liked, so I picked up Heartbreaker and was very disappointed. I didn't really care about the characters, and found the book boring."
3,Disapointed,"Ms.Garwood is my favorit author.I have read all her books and they give me great joy.Her historical are the best.There is no danger for her funs to became bored with them.Her novel is her only book that i put it down before finishing it.If her next will be also a novel I'm not going to buy it.That is saying a lot from a great fun of her that no matter of the hour, or weather,or distance she wii drive to book store to pick up her latest.I do hope that Ms.Garwood will go back to her historicals.She will make me and others happy."
3,Surprisingly VERY Disappointed :-(,"While I have in the past loved Garwood's books, I was surprisingly disappointed in her first (i think) attempt at modern mystery/romance. The storyline was very unbelievable and the characters did not have quite enough ""depth"". The heroine was pretty blah and the hero was just ok. Not what I would expect of a writer such as Garwood. Now....I did enjoy the character Noah Clayborne(any relation to the previous Clayborne's written about ?Hmmm.) I would definitely like to see Garwood write a story with Noah as the main character and who knows maybe the 2nd contemporary would be better than the first......."
5,Great Easy Read,Garwood is a new discovery for me! I enjoy her books and I know that they will keep interested from page one to page end! They are easy beach reads that can be finished in just a few hours if you are an avid reader!
5,Worth every minute spent!!!! What a read!!!!,"Wow!!! I was lent this book from a friend who absolutely raved about it, so I had to see what all the hype was about. Oh my God, what a find!!!! It balances out thrills, mystery, and a healthy dose of romance for those of us who love men in uniform. Nick is a dream boat, even though he is a bit of an idiot, and who does not feel a little disappointment about a gorgeous man like Tommy being a priest? If only a good man like these two actually existed. If you're looking for a good summer read, Heartbreaker is an amazing story that combines all of your cravings. Pick it up, and go on an adventure!!!!"
3,Great Beginning and Ending...,"Father Tom Madden takes confession and is shocked to learn that the penitent has targeted his sister Laurent, for murder. He calls his best friend, FBI Special Agent Nick Buchanan for help. Nick agrees to protect Laurent, especially since the murderer, nicknamed the Heartbreaker, is a lot closer to fulfilling his devious goals than anyone realizes. ... .Mystery/suspense buffs should be warned that this book contains more romance than plausible suspense. Garwood's writing is delicious and fun, but the storyline is flat. The (somewhat shocking) ending is worthy of a good suspense yarn, but the plotting and characters seem dormant. This is a perfect book to pick up for a quiet weekend or lazy day. If it's page-turning action you are looking for in this genre, a better choice may be Catherine Coulter's FBI mystery: Eleventh Hour"
5,Heartbreaker,Julie Garwood has written yet another compelling drama/romance/suspense novel. It includes many characters from her other books so be sure to read them in order! Loved it!
4,Heartbreaker,Exciting and fast paced. I must admit I had identified the wrong villan. The plot is amusing in places when Nick's emotions for Laurent become so conflicted. A good read.
4,Great Book,"If you enjoy suspense, plot twists and a good romance, HEARTBREAKER is a must read.When a killer confesses to Father Tom that his next victim will be the priest's own sister, Father Tom calls his good friend FBI agent Nick Buchanan to protect Laurant. Headstrong Laurant does not want to sit back and be protected...she wants to use herself as bait to catch the Heartbreaker."
4,Deliciously Different!,"I have been a long time fan of historical romances. I put off reading this book for over a year, even though it is written by one of my favorite authors. Now that I have read it I am looking forward to reading Mercy and Killjoy, Garwood's other suspense-romance novels. I was very pleased with this book. I was able to guess the ending about three quarters through the book...but I still enjoyed it! A good read!"
4,Heart Pounding,"My first venture into reading a book by Julie Garwood brought a fine surprise. Although the action is somewhat predictable, I found the suspense quite real. Nick, Laurant, Father Tom, Noah were all fully drawn characters about whom I cared,and the plot was quite ingenious. The confession in the confessional--bless me, father, for I will sin--was enough to capture my immediate attention and propel me through the book at breakneck speed. This was just the ticket for a stormy day at home! I would love to know more about the author's son, to whom she dedicated the book. I found that page perfectly beautiful."
4,Still one of the best,"I enjoyed Heartbreaker. It was predictable, sure, but the story was very enjoyable. I found Nick and Laurant very believable in their affections. I thought the entire story had enough romance & suspense to keep the reader entertained. JG's humor came through only a little bit though, especially toward the end there when Nick was yelling, worried about Laurant. But yes, I'd definitly recommend this book."
5,Wonderful Change of Pace,"I was slightly disappointed at Garwood's ""For the Roses"" series. However, I love so many of her other books I was anxious to see how she would design a contemporary hero/heroine dynamic. I was wonderfully surprised reading ""Heartbreaker"". The pace is quick, and kept me interested. I laughed out loud, cried, and really enjoyed the chemistry she created between the characters. Good Job!"
4,Not all I Hoped It Would Be,"I've been a Julie Garwood fan since I first read ""The Bride"". I have read many of the stories multiple times, and was really looking forward to her first contemporary. The story line was outstanding for a mystery. It kept me turning pages, but I really missed her sense of humor, and I really didn't feel as though I knew her characters very well. I did love Noah, and hope to see him down the line. Worth reading but not my favorite Garwood."
1,A Disappointed Reader,"I've read all of Julie Garwood's books and enjoyed most of them. But this one left me cold. It wasn't romantic; nor was it really suspenseful. In contrast to the funny and charismatic characters Ms. Garwood usually creates, Nick and Laurant might have been cut from cardboard. I started it about four different times but couldn't finish; finally, I skimmed to the end. A disappointing effort by a normally fine writer."
3,Helpful overview,I'm reading this as a prelude and overview to taking on Gibbons' DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. This volume covers a lot of ground though not in much detail. My only exposure to Rome is from a World History class in college and what I have picked up as a hodge-podge from the History Channel. It is a great introduction to understanding the history of Rome.
2,I personally didnt like them.,"My partner didnt seem to get any extra sensation out of them, and I didnt find them very comfortable. I guess I'm just not used to the flared head style of condom (even the biggest man could feel like he'll slip out)."
2,Poor acoustic quality,I had forgotten how bad Deutsche Grammophon CDs are from a sound engineering point of view!!!I regret the purchase of this collection!Jose Rafael Arango
5,A delightful journey,"This fascinating history takes the reader into the very soul of a warm and loving family. The reader is swept along as a third party, sharing the in-depth experiences of life as it existed in the late 19th century and into the mid 20th century, as the family was forced to exist under the oftentimes tyrannical forms of government struggling to survive in the continually changing economics forced upon them by nations in higher power. While the more adventurous family members find a better life in America, others remain behind to deal with life that at times remains unchanged as the rest of the world progesses. Those who put down roots in America prospered on both sides of the continent and became part of the American dream. When this legacy came to an end, I felt I wanted to know more about this family and hope Mr. Smith will consider continuing this delightful saga in the very near future."
4,It's a Polo,"This is just a regular, NFL team polo. The fabric is a little thin (which can be good in the summer), and I wish the shirt was a little longer (so it would stay tucked in). But it was pretty decent for the price, so I have two of these in my closet actually. Just be warned that the large is pretty baggy, so sizes may need to be adjusted for a tighter fit. All-in-all, a good polo if you need to show support for your team at work and don't want to spend $80."
3,good info and easy read,"I purchased this book because I am a horsewoman AND because I had heard that some of the principals of the book were applicable to modifying behavior in other animals - including the human kind. I work with delinquent juveniles and thought it would be fun to read this book and see if it would actually work on both species <g> I'll have to let you know later if they work on kids- not enough data yet <g> There are some good lessons in the book, it's a simple book to read and easy to reread, non-technical for the most part, and full of just good common sense. Worth the price of purchase easily!"
2,Horses Don't Lie,"I'm sure that the author is a great horse person. However, I never got the relationship between horse traits and our traits. Yes, horsses teach us patience, awareness and leadership. However, there are not a number of examples that demonstrate how that happens in the author's experience. The book rambles. The author speaks mostly in generaalites. Interwoven is the facts of Irwin's life with horses. I work with horses. I've read many ""Horse"" books. This is not one I'd recommend."
1,Unhappy with content,I am glad I checked out from library versus paying money for this book. I kept reading hoping for substance but none existed. No concrete examples for everyday use.
2,Not impressed.,"I expected more from this book and was very disappointed. In fact, I found myself bored while reading and had to re-read several passages as the words all just started to jumble together."
4,Historical building,"I love building games that are historical and give you other options about doing things that are political, etc. It isn't the most informative tutorial nor does the manual explain enough but you learn by trial and error fairly easily and that is how I play it. Not an exciting game for those who love to fight and love action games. It's more for the slow paced game lover who likes to build and loves historical references."
3,Great gra\phics,Nice game but not quite my choice for the most part. Gave it to a friend and he loves it.
4,Easy Fix,"Don't let other reviews fool you. This is a damn good game, good for wasting countless hours. I'm in Iraq so theres not a whole lot to be done during down time, and most games get real old, real fast. The Guild 2 has helped me through it all, and has run a few weeks of this deployment. It is however a little buggy, but most of which got fixed in the most recent patch. The internet is horrible over here, but the patch version 1.2 only took a few minutes to download, and after that I was good to go. Easy. Don't let people saying this game has has a lot of bugs skew your decision. Once you patch it you'll be pleased."
3,DVD-R,"The product appears to be exactly what I was expecting to receive. However, I have not had the chance to actually test the quality of the DVD's but do plan to copy some movies from VHS to DVD in the near future."
1,"YA SENT ME -R's TWICE and I ordered +R's, the firm filling this order are IDIOTS!",I ordered DVD+R DVD and you sent me the -R's~~I returned them with a message Re: +R DVD's ONLY and I'll be damn if you didn't SEND ME THE WRONG DVD'S TWICE. Can the people packing this merchandise READ ENGLISH???
1,THESE DISCS ARE TERRIBLE,DO NOT BUY THESE DISCS> NONE OF THE DVDS I BURN WITH THESE DISCS WORK PERFECTLY. THEY ACTUALLY LEAVE OUT CHUNKS OF VIDEO AND BECOME DIGITAL MESSESS ON THE TV. CRAP. BUY VERBATIM AND BURN ON A BURNER THAT DOES REAL x1 not x4 like anything new school you gotta get a dvd burner from 2003 or earlier
4,good product but expensive,"I trust the SONY name. Of 12 disks that I recorded, 2 failed verification, so I had to discard the 2 and re-record them. I paid about $23 for 50 disks and then found I could get 100 for the same price at Costco."
1,Not happy,I bought a 5-pack of Sony DVD-R discs at Walgreens for $2.00. They aren't worth $0.20. All five returned unrecoverable errors while trying to burn a system repair disc. Window 7 diagnostics said the media wasn't writable. I've read comments on a couple of PC forums regarding the same issue with Sony DVD-R discs.
5,DVD-R by Sony,"I received my order in a timely manner and the packaging was very neat and protective. i enjoy this brand because I rarely have ""dud"" disk that are bad disk that won't record. I recommend this brand."
5,Sony stills produce the best,I have always bought Sony blank media and I have not had any problem with any products. All of these 50 DVD disc work great and none of these didn't work. Amazon offers the best price for these except other retail stores. I used all of these for data like photos and videos and I've had no problem while burning or after. I was so satisfied I will buy more and I would recommend this to anyone who wants blank DVDs.
1,Not really 16x ! Totally false and misleading product.,"I have a SONY DRU710A 16x DVD burner with the latest firmware installed. All of my burning software only recognize these discs as 8x write. Even Nero's program that scans the disc and tells you the actuall speed says these are up to 8x NOT 16x. I've also used Roxio Disc Copier 7 and 8, all only go to 8x when these are put in. I just reloaded an older firmware version and now it can be 12x..."
5,Not one coaster,"I burn them on a Plextor drive. I've been using them for about a year, at the middle of my second hundred now. Never a playback issue as far as compatibility issues with Magnavox, Pioneer, Denon, Sony, Samsung....They are on sale all the time. I'll continue to purchase them."
5,good product,"good product, in the same condition as stated, recommend it for other people. High quality discs."
1,Malaysian made Sony discs are junk.,"Sony DVD-r media used to be one of the best on the market, but no longer. Sony discs made in Malaysia are of poor quality. Despite the Sony name and the AccuCORE branding these discs have very high error rates and my DVD recorder has rejected them altogether. After burning 10 discs out of a 50 disc spindle, I had 8 errors. I simply threw them out after discovering all the bad reviews on the Malaysian made discs. Avoid them. Sony DVD-r made in Taiwan were very reliable, but the Malaysian made are absolutely a waste of your money."
1,Not very good dvd's,Half of the dvd's end up as coasters. Not good for video at all. I've tried 2 different burners & get the same problems. TDK & Memorex work a lot better for me.
3,So far so good,Worked as expected. Bought this one long ago and reviewing now.Used only few by now and while using those got error in some of them.
1,FAIL!,"Honestly, I have tried to give Sony blank media product a fair chance, but every time, it comes up wanting. Having a package of these DVD, I attempted several burnings and nearly EVERY one of them FAILED. Only ONE burn succeeded. It's not the first time I've had problems with Sony's blank disc media products. Can;t say I'll ever buy anything from Sony ever again. PASS!"
5,Excellent! No complaints.,"Bought these for my husband and they were exctly what he needed. Never had a problem with them at all, good price!"
5,Excellent DVD Price,What is important is a good price and fast shipping. You can't go wrong with Sony. They make excellent products and ALWAYS stand behind there product. I would buy from this seller again.
1,Giving up,"I used nothing but Sony DVD-R discs for nearly six years and had no problems with them until now. The latest stack that I bought is horribly unreliable. At least 40% of them so far have been bad, not passing data verification or playing back video with glitches even if they do pass it. I tried two different software programs and even replaced my desktop PC's DVD burner in case it was failing, but continued to have bad luck with them. My laptop's DVD burner software sees these discs as 8X rather than 16X like they're rated, and the odds of them working seems to increase at burn speeds below 8X. But I'm definitely not getting what I paid for anymore, so I'll be switching to a new brand."
1,don't know why... Love Sony... But these stink!,"I've always bought my CDs and DVDs from Sony but this time they are awful! I just opened the package to do file back-ups and the first 4 disks have all had errors. I tried burning from an older package and they work fine! Something is wrong with these newer Sony disks.---------12 disks later and they all failed! More than 15 years of using Sony products I've never had so much failure!Bought some CDs, they work fine. Tried another brand of DVDs I happened to have they worked. It's not my computer, just this batch of disks!"
2,Good deal but lot of discs fail,"Amazon clearly has the best price on these discs, plus with free shipping (prime member), it's a steal. However, about 25% of the discs failed. Talk about frustration. I always use Sony DVD-R's and had no problem (maybe 1 failure) with 3 sets of 25 Sony DVD-Rs previously (purchased at Best buy within the past 2 years). Could happen from the shipping process or that these are no longer quality dvd-r's. I will purchase this set of 25 from a retail store and see if the same problems occur."
3,broken case,"the cases were all cracked and unusable, they need to do a better job at packaging to protect the cases"
4,10 for 10 so far...,"IMPORTANT: This review applies to Sony 50PK DVD-R, 4.7GB, 50-ct spindle, 16X. Discs are from Malaysia. Packaging is similar, but not identical, to the Amazon picture. Same yellow + black design for the label, but my spindle has no people on the label. I think it's likely a newer label than what is pictured here.BEFORE YOU BUY: In fine print on the outer label of this 50-ct spindle Sony advises, ""Before use, please check compatibility at [...]."" This site discusses different operating systems and different DVD burners. I would recommend you go to this site and check your setup before ordering.I ran a blank disc through 'disc identifier' software. The Media Code for these discs is 'SONY16D1.'My experience: So far I'm very happy with these discs. I've had 100% success after burning ten discs.From what I've researched: On a scale of EXCELLENT-OKAY-POOR, SONY16D1 discs from Malaysia have a reputation for being 'OKAY.' A 75-90% burn success rate is anticipated."
4,"No problems, highly rated on quality",I burned all 50 discs copying old 8mm video tapes to DVD on a Panasonic DVD recorder. Zero errors. Every disc appears to be perfect. What else can I say except that you can get a 100 disc spindle these days for nearly the identical price. I just ordered mine.
3,Works well but very noisy.,"Although this humidifier works well overall doing what it is supposed to do, it is very big and very noisy even on the quietest setting after it has been on for awhile. When I first turned it on the lowest setting, I was pleasantly surprised how quiet it was, but then a half hour later I noticed how very loud it was... the noise increases gradually until you think there is a jet hoovering overhead. I have not used the remote control since that seems to be a waste. I really cannot recommend this item."
2,Not worth the money,"Despite the product description, this humidifier is quite loud, especially if you use the highest setting. The filters are not at all mold resistant. I just replaced one less than two months ago and it is already filled with mold. Definitely look elsewhere."
2,No dialogue. No action. No plot. No point.,"I suppose I was expecting something a bit more Bollywood. I picked it up because I wanted to listen to the Hindi. Mostly, I listened to my own yawning.This film had so much potential, and it was wasted. The idea of someone going from butcher to pacifist is not new -- it has been done before, and I expected better. I was disappointed.When I went to the special features -- there weren't any! There was commentary and that's it. I started to listen to the commentary but couldn't handle the dullness of that. Another wasted opportunity: There was a curse on a building used in the film, which was mentioned in passing in the commentary. You should have expanded on that! That would have been interesting!This is worth watching once for some of the scenery, but not worth a purchase."
1,Rated R for what?,"Ok, If you like a movie that has hardly any dialogue ( maybe a paragraphs worth for the whole movie) no fighting or any samurai action (even though the dvd box said there was) and if you like a movie that shows a man walking through the desert for an hour then this movie is for you."
4,Worth a look...,"I picked this up at blockbuster b/c I thought it was going to be a samurai flick with action. There is NO samurai action, nor is hardly any fighting sequences. The back of the box says there is both! Yet, I still greatly enjoyed this movie. This movie is a drama about a man who worked for a ""Lord"" who ruled their country. After encountering an experience with a girl who by chance had crossed paths with his little boy, he experiences an epiphany. The story then ends with the struggles to remove himself peacefully (both physically and mentally) from his previous violent past. A very good plot, with powerful moments expressed via few words.Subtitles for those who don't like subtitles and at several points in the movie the viewer is required to interpret what the actor is thinking."
3,See Asoka instead,"The other reviews, both good and bad, tell what to expect and not expect here. The movie Asoka is what I had hoped this movie would be."
5,Perfect Bible for Catholic Tweens,"I came across this wonderful Bible while homeschooling my children (ages 10 and 12). This is the perfect link between those picture Bibles for very young children and the more in-depth ""Teen Bibles"". Every book of the Bible is covered and made very easy to understand, even for adults! If you want an excellent overview of the Bible, written in simple language, this is the perfect choice."
1,"Erotic, sex & Love","This is not a 3D Blue ray, I buy it in 3D, it's only 2D player. I'm not happy about that."
2,Air - Alpha Beta Gaga,"While I'm sure that Mark Ronson meant well when he gave Air's single ALPHA BETA GAGA a hip-hop beat and an MC, the fact of the matter is: it doesn't work. The lyrics are trite, and even without the lyrics, the tracks has simply been sped up and given a beat. Was that even necessary? Jackson fares a ltitle better with his mix, adding some dub effects and icy computer beat into the fray, but it's less than what he's capable of."
5,a wonderful book for beginning readers,"My son who just started kindergarten loves this book. It is all he wants to talk about, and can't wait to read it again. He says ""its really cool"""
2,Does not live up to Advertisement,"The Advertisement says, ""Never enter sales data into QuickBooks Financial Software again!"" After I bought it, I found out it doesn't assign a sales representative to each sale when it transfers information to Quickbooks Pro 2002. When you pay commissions, this is an important piece of information. It only sends a consolidated receipt for each type of transaction (cash, check or credit card)and does not include what was sold. It also does not make inventory updates to Quickbooks. I had been waiting for this program to come out for a couple of months, and unfortunately I will be sending it back. Hopefully they will make improvements on the data exchange on the next version."
3,Simple elegant semi-melodic joy!,"Rather badly produced but completely made up for by brilliant joy and amusement. Have attitude, have concepts and have musical gift."
4,good value,This is a great value. Has two large bags. I wish it had some larger tips as well as the smaller ones.
5,"Nice starter set, price is right","I have been using these a few weeks now and am happy with the set. I don't bother with the pastry bags, I just use a cheap generic storage bag and toss it afterward. The tip and coupler fit just fine and then I don't have to clean the pastry bags, which are always a pain.This set has a nice basic starter group that will keep most people happy who just want simple and not to professionally decorate."
2,China Made Junk,Made in China junk. Extremely cheesy construction. It fell apart during first attempt to use it. Even the plastic container holding the parts was broken when delivered. This is something one would give a child to pretend decorate cakes with.
4,Everything needed!,This is a great set of most of the things you need to pipe frosting. My only negative is the case it comes is is super cheap and broke on my first use.
3,Flower Pick!,"The tips are great and the bags also! But the Flower Pick is terrible. As I picked it up to inspect it, the metal disc part falls off! It looked as if it was barely on there in the first place! I would have sent it back but I needed to use it immediately so I kept it."
3,what's with the bags?,"What's with these pastry bags? they are a fabric that is lined with plastic. This means that they are difficult to clean. I would have to wash them out really well in the sink, and THEN wash them in the washing machine to not ruin any clothes with them. Completely IMPRACTICAL. I decided to throw out the bags after one use because it wasn't worth my time to clean them. I'll stick to disposable or rubber bags from now on.The tips seem fine and sturdy with a nice variety. I found the plastic attachment pieces a little hard to screw in, but that also might have been because the bags were too thick. The case is not on hinges and does not clamp together in any way so i have to use a rubber band to make sure it does not open and spill out.Decent product for the price overall. Definitely worth it just for the variety of tips in a case. Throw in some disposable bags and I'd call it a good beginners kit."
4,Great Pattern - Medium Quality,"My wife and I are expecting our first child soon and we both really liked this color scheme and pattern collection (Secret Garden). We received the hamper in good condition and it was good to go right out of the box. The fabric and pattern were what we expected, however I was particularly dissapointed in the quality of the wood used as the frame of the hamper - very flimsy and not very sturdy. We are still going with the Secret Garden theme but were a little surprised with the product quality."
2,poor quality,"We bought the whole Secret Garden set three years back and love the patterns and look of it all. This particular hamper, however, is cheap and flimsy. It is made from light, flimsy wood that is held together haphazardly with a few small nails. The nails came out easily after a few months and the cheap wood does not hold up when you try to nail it back together."
5,I got Tricked.,"Its kind of a funny story. When i was looking at the picture for some reason i thought that the item i was buying was was actually a glass hornet dart thing. but when i got it in the mail and opened it, it was obviously paper. I got it for my father for christmas and he still loved it. So no complaints here. :)"
4,Good book for beginners,I'm in my 30s now.....I wanted to re-learn how to make a plant hanger like I had done about 20 years ago in 7th grade....Try as I might I couldn't remember how to do it from memory so I went in search for a good book from the '70s that could remind me. This is a pretty cool book - its has the basic knots that I was looking for and has good instructions. It still seemed easier to do when I was 12 yrs old sitting there in art class but this book gave me a good start. It has a wide variety of things to make and many pictures to show/inspire. Don't think I'll be making that macrame purse with fringe but the plant hanger was good.
3,Good basic book,"I have ""Hempmasters"" and this book. I primarily refer to this one for instructions on basic knots. I find the pictures very easy to follow and they are grouped together on 4 pages. I don't have to flip through the book looking for different knots."
3,"Too long, much too long","I read this with great anticipation, and was even fortunate enough to see the Dalai Lama while I was reading it, and it was still too much for me. How in the world the SECRET wasn't figured out until 80% into the story boggles my mind. I figured it out in the first couple of chapters. Still, Shan is an interesting fellow, but the whole story was too melancholy for me. And slow. And long."
3,"Interesting setting, but much too long","This is an excellent story of the oppression of native peoples by the Communist Chinese and of human greed's role in the new China. However, it is also a murder mystery, and as such, the story could have been told in half the space, even with all the sociopolitical information. In addition, the number of characters and the complexity of their names and ethnicities is truly bewildering. I'm hoping that Pattison's later works are improved in this regard."
3,A bit over the top,"A disappointing follow-up to a fabulous first novel. It starts well enough, but sinks in its own ponderous righteousness. The monks, the embodiment of truth and good in a landscape withered by evil now have even more mystical powers. Think X-Files meets Kung-Fu.Characters are not well developed. They are instead a mishmash of standard types - the crusty tough guy with the tearful story and a heart of gold; the menacing leader of the bad guys who finds the light, etc. Ick.It's still better written than most of the drivel out there, but a good editor could have salvaged this book."
2,Asian Lord of the Rings,I had enjoyed The Skull Mantra and was looking forward to the sequel. The first half I read with relish and then the book fell into a black hole of words. It did nothing more than rehash the first half. I have no idea what the mystery was supposed to be - that was lost on me. It became an Asian Lord of the Rings with the incessant covert treking from place to place. It even had it's own Gandolf - Gendun. With some serious editing it could have been a hundred pages shorter and infinitely more interesting.
1,Viewsonic 220 and 225 series awful!,"Our company purchased two years ago thirty two (32) Viewsonic 220 and 225 monitors. As of July 2004, eighteen (18) have literally gone up in smoke. These monitors are miserable pieces of junk and pose a safety hazard."
1,pointless,"This movie was a dissapointing waste of time. It showed that violence happens within family units and that not all people are bad. That's it. Dull, uninteresting, negative, with no moral or even ending to the story. Junk."
2,Constantly drops connection,When I start up my Mac it intermittently drops the USB port connection and my mouse / keyboard don't work until I unplug- replug this thing. Something is not fully Kosher with this thing and I'm now looking to replace it. Beware.
2,Disappointing USB hub,Case fell apart 5 minutes after I got it.I got what I paid for.Packing container was also damaged in shipment. UPS....
2,Stopped working after a week,Worked fine for a week and then simply stopped working. Have tested power supply etc. but no luck.
2,Displeased with Item,"I am the new owner of a aluratek 4 port hub. Sad to say that when I plug it into my computer while plugged into external power it shorts my usb connector and shuts down any of my 3 pc's. I suspect it is just a defective unit. I'm not going to worry about sending back, just get another one down the road. Also the cord on this thing is so short it's useless. I am very displeased with this device. I will add that it does run my portable hard drive and charge my phone at the same time w/ no external power source."
2,"Works, but has some issues...","The first problem with this device is the cable is about 2 inches long. I started using this device and I rarely turn off my PC so I figured everything was working fine...that was until I rebooted my PC (Intel D865PERL motherboard, Corsair RAM) and it froze up after displaying the type of RAM I have. It was about a month since I rebooted last and started using the Aluratek hub so it took me a while to figure out it was the USB hub. Soon as I unplugged it my PC booted right up and I was able to plug in the hub again after I was booted up. I'd give it 4 stars if it wasn't for the cable length, no extension cable being included, and the lock up problem on reboot."
1,Returned for exchange,I had to return the item because it stopped working a few days after I received it.Hopefully they will give me another one.Victor
1,Don't even bother !,"I have read that the Presley estate is working hard to preserve Elvis and his memory.I will always be a life long fan,but this cd is absolute garbage..he obliviously was so drugged that every song he never could complete,or just joked and laughed all the entire show..Not a good way to remember Elvis...I guess if your a devoted fan like me and your curious you can buy this like I did,listen to this one time,like I did..and throw it in the garbage like I did. !"
5,rayjoy@ipa.net,"To me this book is an outstanding, reader's book. It kept me glued to 1st Sgt Hamblen's exploits all through the book. I had to force myself to put it down so I could get some sleep at night. But then I expected no less since Bruce Norton was involved in writting this book."
5,One good book,The book came as described and was in great condition.A great Autobiography of a soldier's story. Very descriptive and insightful.
1,More Spies,"Once again we have the real heroes, all deep behind the enemy lines. I guess myself and my Sergeant Major buddy here in Beaufort were the only mud Marines in Vietnam as everyone else was in recon or sog. Hamblen states that all the 62 ""missions"" ( behind the lines- whereever that was)are no longer classified and that is why he is talking about them. Well Major Norton, just produce the evidence and you can prove your case and stop slamming your questioners. I find it rather strange that all the Vietnamese we sent undercover into North Vietnam were captured and executed yet a one legged caucasian came and went 62 times without a hitch. How about a book about that? RA Doyle USMC retired."
5,SPRIT FILLED,"How to describe what ONE needs to hear? EagleMan's voice speakstruth and tells a story that each two-legged needs to be aware of. Thesinging and drumming create openings for Spirit to Move us. With the hearing of Black Elks songs-we can return the gift by repeating these songs. Blue Man, it is a good day to die!!Hokahey!!!!!"
1,Worthless,Purchased and found this book to be worthless. Agree with the other reviewer 100% and won't waste my time expanding on my thoughts.
2,Oldy,"I was disappointed in this book. It was last copywrited in 1978 all old tech info. Maybe alright for a green newbe, but I'm giving mine away (if I can )"
5,Best Hot Sauce!,"If you like hot sauces, this one is the best. It's very ""hot"" but very flavorful as well. Goes well with meats, seafood, even plantains. It's a spice-lovers must-have."
2,Dave's Gournet Scotch Bonnet Hot Sauce,I would not buy this again. This is a medium sauce made from one of the hottest peppers on Earth.
3,What's the big idea?!,"I've read both books included here, The Final Judgment and Degree of Guilt. Both books are good, entertaining, legal thrillers. Patterson is a good author (although a bit liberal for my tastes), and I've enjoyed all his books.But I can't understand the reason behind this two volume selection. Why is ""Final Judgment"" included. This was just released recently as the CAROLINE MASTERS paperback which was relased before that as FINAL JUDGMENT. It all seems deceptive to me. Patterson could have chosen another novel to include that wasn't already the subject of a con job to the public. How many ways can one book be marketed. First they change its title, then they release it in different form with the original title... I am losing respect for Patterson because of this deceiptful marketing."
5,this guys does it all,I've found another super author and again am going broke buying and reading everything he's written. Mr Patterson keeps you on the edge of your seat...wondering who done did that??? how'd that happen?? and its almost impossible to put down the books once you pick them up. I can't wait for more from this author!!!!
2,Worst Filming Ever!,"This would have made a decent video if it had been filmed competently but the video director chose to film everything in super macro close-up. I found it unbearable to watch!It's a shame because the musical performance is excellent and Peter Sellars does a better job at staging Giulio Cesare than I expected. Of course, it's hard to tell since we can't tell what the stage looks like because the entire video is in super close-up.I would recommend this video just for the music if there were no other choices for Giulio Cesare. But since there are several to choose from, you can do better than this. My recommendation is for the one conducted by William Christie.I am surprised a big label like Decca would put out such a poorly made video."
2,Peter Sellars Handel Giulio Cesare,"The 20 Century costumes, including swimming attire, are too avant garde for me. I would like to see the opera in a more traditional setting."
4,Makes camping easy,I got this tent as a five-year anniversary gift from work and have enjoyed the heck out of it (more so than work!). I have camped beachfront and at racetracks and really enjoy how easy it is to set up for one person. The rainfly is included and came in handy NASCAR weekend at MIS when it rained most of Saturday. I have not had any problems with gear and if treated well I don't see why it won't last for years.
2,"A few good nuggets in a dense, dry book.","This book focuses heavily on the writing process; it discusses pre-writing, free writing, revising, and editing at great length. But it does not discuss them in a brief or interesting way. I found the text sometimes repetitive, sometimes wordy, and frequently dry.Plus, the non-process writing advice is either highly abstract or narrowly focused on a hypothetical scenario used throughout the book. So the advice is less than helpful in many respects. And though the text contains some gems, they are usually buried in long, dense paragraphs or blurred by a stiff and formal tone."
2,WARNING! RE-RECORDING of PAST HITS!,"These are not all the original recordings! Some of them are recorded ""live"""" If you are looking for the great original versions, look elsewhere! I am always slightly bothered when I buy an album expecting one thing and get another.All that said...this is not a BAD album...as a matter of fact I will keep it. And I must say it's good to hear this band still together. But PLEASE...if an artist puts out a ""Best of"" album, it should have the ORIGINAL songs on it or else it should state that it has ""NEW RECORDINGS""."
3,Fledgling performers bite the big time. Yo.,"Kriss Kross's intelligent blend of juvenile hip-hop with hardcore tinges transcends the racial boundary between pure white-bread pop and burnt-toast ghetto. Offering elaborate insights to a middle-schooler's paradigm, we are entertained while being educated on such antics as missing the bus and learning exactly who'z da man. Yo.Unfortunately, such high critical standards were not applied in making the Krossed Out World video. The message conveyed in songs like ""Jump"" are lost when remixed in a live setting. Somehow, Kriss Kross looks tired and faded by this video, as if anticipating their spectacular fall from stardum later in the year. Yo.In conclusion, this video is a must for die-hard Kriss Kross collectors; the casual observer is better off renting the video to sample the end of an EXTRAVAGENT era of middle-school rap. Yo."
5,A Big Hit,"I highly recommend this very informative book. Many beautiful pictures, and lots of experienced advice. You won't be disappointed."
1,I thought SONY was a trusted name!,"The sound qualty of this CD has to rate among the worst I've ever heard. Alphonso deserves much better than this and Sony Music (their name is on it, should be thouroughly embarrassed for this nonsense. No master tapes used here folks, just good old fashioned vinyl. And the tracks run into one another. As soon as I figure out how to translate the Sonymusic.fr (France) website, I'll will be giving them an earful and demanding a refund.Such an outstanding bassist, outstanding material, but poor sound quality of CD."
2,"Way too much discriptions, and not enough plot.","I've read 5 Georges' books so far and loved them all, except this. You have to read about 20 pages of discriptions just to read a page or two of the story..Boring.."
5,Great book!,I always enjoy Linley books! I believe this one was made into a PBS movie but I would rather read the book than watch the movie...The setting at the school with the parallels to Linley's Eaton experience gave details into his character that I found insightful.
3,Well-written but sometimes hard to follow.,"As seems to the norm with books written by this author, there are lots of narrative paragraphs that go off on tangents. However, there is a well-rounded, colorful cast of characters which leaves Lynley and Havers chasing their tails at times. As usual, the author leaves many avenues open for exploration and it takes a good amount of deductive reasoning to figure out how and why Matthew was killed. If you don't want a lot of trivial information clouding up your mind, this is not the book for you. But, if you're looking for a book that points out the differences of social classes in a private school, and how those differences lead to murder, this is right up your alley."
2,George's naivete on Human Sexuality,"I was dismayed by Ms. George'm s constant reference pairing Pedophilia with homosexuality. Further demonstrating her English provincial mores of this perversion by allowing her protagonist, Inspector Lynley to actually protect a fellow classmate and not disclose or better yet arrest the fellow for possessing ""child pornography""(even giving it a name seems to relegate it's status to acceptable seems beyond comprehension)."
4,A 21st century Agatha Christie,"Ms. George has her own flair, but for those who love Christie, Ms. George's style has recaptured the psychological thriller of Christie and adapted to the modern day. Fun read with lots of twists and turns."
4,Well Schooled in Murder,Well written and easy to follow. The subject was pretty grisly. I'm not a mystery reader but my sister suggested I would like Elizabeth George's Inspector Lynley. Liked his character a lot. Typical mystery these days where there are about 5-6 people who could have committed the murder. You don't find out until the final pages. Her style of writing is enjoyable.
3,Doesn't quite live up to later novels.,"I enjoyed this book because the reader meets Inspector Lynley and DS Havers in their early versions -- and not quite developed to my liking. George's later works are spell-binding with outstanding character development. Because her later writings are so good, this story is just slightly off her mark."
4,...in the name of education,"The Lynley/Havers series shows steady improvement with this book, a complex mystery that takes on some of the class and education issues that are a little murky for the average American. Beyond exposing the evils in English public schools, it was an interesting examination of what sacrifices the characters made for their educations, and a questioning of what *did* they really learn all those years in school."
5,Well-Rounded Who-Dun-It,"Elizabeth George continues her expert writing in this tale of intrigue and mystery. Her forte is in the very human qualities she instills in her characters, good or bad. They become known to the reader, and believable in their very humanness. Her craft leads the reader to make multiple guesses as to the murderer, because of the very human traits they carry. It makes for a fun, entertaining, and captivating read!"
4,Well-Schooled in Murder,"This is another great book from Elizabeth George. It is very sad, well written, a terrible insight into life in a fictional boys boarding school."
1,Not my thing,"This is my first review after owning my kindle for nearlt two years. This is the first book I haven't finished. I feel mislead by the previous reviews. The characters were aimless and the plot never really got going. (I stopped reading at 55%). It seemed to be almost a ""hospital"" drama, rather than the mystery I was expected. There was a lot of ""woe-is-me"" nurse in charge stuff that didn't interest me at all."
3,Tedious,This book was rather tedious. Too much action. It detracted from the storyline. Once one crisis was over anther immediately started or was already in progress. Overkill. I did manage to make it to the end of the book. It was worth the effort...but barely. His books need more substance and less flash.
4,Stretching the Envelope,"If he just wouldn't have created a 100 foot-long caiman. The swarm of giant locusts, the enormous anaconda, even the jumping land piranhas stretched the envelope of reality, but with a little imagination they were still plausible. Unfortunately, a cousin of the alligator 33 yards long tainted this otherwise exciting and inventive thriller.James Rollins took the often used theme of a disease caused by man's intrusion into the natural order which threatens to destroy civilization, and reconfigured that storyline in a new way so it makes sense and entertains at the same time. Once you answer the question that naturally arises, ""Is this for real?""and accept that much of the story is tongue-in-cheek, you should have a great time letting your imagination use Rollin's descriptions to thrill and entertain you. Then, even a 100 foot long caiman will make sense."
4,Jungle Jim lives,"I just finished reading this novel and was pleased with it. I was actually sorry to see it end and would like to see another adventure with Nate, Kelly and Dr Kouwe who are among the main characters.This book has enough scientific material, enough mystery and good enough characters to keep you turning the pages continuously until you are done. The traitor was predictable and there was a surprise loss of one member of the crew which was disappointing but overall, most enjoyable and good escape literature. I downloaded this on my kindle and usually read a few chapters every night at bedtime and I found myself reading longer than planned each night. A good sign that the story is interesting.I gave it a 4 instead of a five because of some predictability and seriously considered it a 5. The characters are well developed, and one really learns to dislike the bad guys in this novel.I recommend it."
4,Another Great book by James Rollins,"James Rollins has created a world in Amazonia that grabs you and transports you into the Amazon. The descriptions of the Amazon, and the characters are brought to life in vivid detail.When I first began reading Amazonia, I thought that maybe the idea was a bit to far fetched, A man who had one arm going into the Amazon comes out with two? I mean that is really out there, and I was skeptical, but as the story moves along, the plot takes hold and you are brought into a wonderful world with surprises around every corner.I especially liked the descriptions of the village in the end of this book, they were fascinating. I read Amazonia in two nights, and once you pick it up, I think you will have a hard time putting it down!I highly recommend James Rollins' Amazonia!"
3,"Good start, but...","I must say that I really enjoy James Rollins' work. This book starts off strong, the plot is engaging, the animal attacks make you cringe. But the ending is downright ridiculous and very disappointing."
2,Too Inplausible,"Admittedly, I purchased this book as an easy read for a vacation in Central America. The basic story line was intriguing: an expedition disappears, without a trace, in the uncharted Amazon. For the first 200 pages, the book was difficult to put down, as the expedition enters the rainforest and begins its quest. But, as the mysteries are revealed the drama fades. The characters don't react as real persons to what they are subjected to, instead soldering on in a cliched way. Bizzarre creatures take over the story. Despite the sometimes tedious and unnecessary detail and the collapsing and unrealistic plot, I read on to the end, hoping the story would redeem itself. I wanted to find out about the mysterious Ban-ali tribe that haunts the book from its inception. But, the mystical Ban-ali tribe, when they are finally revealed, are uninspiring, one dimensional and never seriously developed."
2,very disappointed,"I got three of Mr. Robbins books on the recommendation of one of his family members I sold a book to. Amazonia is my first read and I may not read the rest based on this book. It is too long. The creatures are far-fetched and unbelievable. Why the plague is spreading all over the U.S. despite the fact that the body was flown to Florida is mind boggling. I keep putting the book down and picking it up again because I hate to waste good money not reading something I have paid for. There are too many characters wasting too much space that I don't care anything about. What's with Tor-Tor? Could have been an interesting character but all he does is chuff. Sorry. So, far, this author is not all he's cracked up to be. This book is boring."
2,flat and plodding,"I expected to read a sciencific fact-based book with lots of suspense, intelligent characters, and steamy atmospherics, but I got a plot,--or should I say plod--that was completely flat, with stock villians and insipid heroes. For an example of sterotypical characters, look at Rollins' depiction of the U.S. Rangers. If I ever get stranded in the jungle with these guys (and one gal)--then, I hope to be rescued by Black Hawk Down, or Big Bird! The science is virtually non-existent; the research into the Yanomamo and other indigenous people of the Amazon is weak, and the American scientists are portrayed as shallow seekers for a big Cure. The plot goes in leaps and I was unable to acheive the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" that is essential to an engaging adventure novel. I like Lincoln Childs!"
4,Grabs you from page 1,"Like all of James Rollins' books it presents a fascinating premise within the first couple of pages. One of the things I like about his writing is that there is very little ""fluff"", that is he sticks to the story and keeps it moving along at a fast clip. Every chapter was different and fascinating.I like the way he often uses actual places in his books (although the Amazon doesn't seem too mysterious"". In this book, I assume the plants and shaman medicines described are real, as are many of the dangers normal to that part of the world.The only negative comment is that this book (as well as Subterranean) stretches the imagination a bit too much for my liking. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the read and finished the book in a few days, I have a hard type imagining a 100' long alligator, for example.Don't let this deter you though. If you enjoyed any of his other books you'll not be disappointed with Amazonia."
3,It could have been better...,"I loved the plot - it kept you on the edge of your seat. As with his other books, though, it did have too many gory deaths. I understand that some gory deaths help contribute to the story, but a good number of these ones were just unnecessary."
5,Great Vacation book,I took this book on vacation to Mexico and it was hard to put down. The first thing I did when I finished it was buy another Rollins book. It is always great to find a new author.
2,extreme action,"After reading several of this author's works, I felt compelled to write a review. The book is interesting, but gets much too out into left field in the activities of its players. Not in the fantasy department, but in the extreme actions the folks can manage to pull off. This is a failing in all of Rollins' books, it seems, and really detracts from the story line. These do not come up to Jeff Long and Childs & Preston."
4,good popcorn book,"Take this book for what it is. It's a by the numbers action/adventure story. It you can get past that and suspend your disbelief (especially when it comes to Tor-Tor) you'll really enjoy this tale of non-stop jungle adventure. There is plenty of action, violence, and gore. I listened to the book on cassette and the reader does a great job of using different voices, expression, and inflection. It would make a great popcorn movie."
3,Amazonia,"The story has a great plot, flows smoothly and gives reader some great thought provoking issues, but a bit unreal at times. Overall a good read."
3,Tongue-In- Cheek,"If he just wouldn't have created a 100 foot long caiman. The swarm of giant locusts, the enormous anaconda, even the jumping land piranhas stretched the envelope of reality, but with a little imagination they were till plausible. Unfortunately, a cousin of the alligator 33 yards long tainted this otherwise exciting and inventive thriller.James Rollins took the often used theme of a disease caused by man's intrusion into the natural order which then threatens to destroy civilization, and reconfigured that storyline in a new way so it makes sense and entertains at the same time. Once you answer the question that naturally arises, ""Is this book for real?"" and accept that much of the story is tongue-in-cheek, you should have a great time letting your imagination use Rollin's descriptions to thrill and entertain you. Then even a 100 foot long caiman will make sense."
4,Enjoyed this book,"Very interesting read. Had no idea where the story was going, but then it hooked me in and I found it hard to put down."
5,It was Awesome,"This was my first Rollins novel and I thought it was one of the best action/adventure books I've ever read. Aside from being action packed, it was also very suspenseful. You had no idea what was going to happen next. You kept thinking that the group of bad guys might get them only to have them run into some unknown danger from the depths of the jungle. The constant action and suspense keeps you glued to this book.Also aside from the non-stop action there are also several subplots like the fact that a sickness is plaguing the world and the romance between Nate and Kelly, and the fact that the leader of the men that want to kill Nate already has his own problems with the Rand family. There is enough intrigue and action in this book to keep readers very interested."
4,Just a good fun read,"If you've ever read any of James Rollins other books, you know his style, and this book, while older, stays in that vein.Exotic locations, elite military team, cool adventurer protagonist with a troubled past, and pure evil bad guys.Pretty much modern day Indiana Jones type of adventure.This is just a fun easy read, and while you can get through a book like this in a matter of days, it does also bring into question some larger social-economical themes as well."
5,"Amazonia, One of the Best","Amazonia One of the Best.If you thought the creatures miles below the earth was enough to be feared in Rollins first book, then your in for one wild ride. packed full of action, facts, and in the middle of the jungle.Charictar depth is accutly one only James could come up with, delving into pasts and forging their futures.This book is in the top five of my favorite from Rollins, The book is full of mutant jungle creaters, wild adventure, and also dealing with world-wide consequenses if this team appointed by DARPA* (If my memory serves me right) to search for the cure of an epidemic that grew straight out of the vast jungle of the Amazon.I highly recomend this book to the most avid readers, to the people who only read when they travel. hint, hint makes a great gift too!"
3,A Longggg Journey to Anti-Climatic Ending,"A long tiresome journey to an anti-climatic ending.Noticed inconsistencies in characters behavior in environment,struggling to get thru jungle, and avoid dangers, yet, run ahead6 miles to radio other team.? huh? seemed out of context, and that's just one example.I love unbelievable & over-the-top action, that make me not careabout substance, like Matt Reilly (just love him) but was disappointed in AMAZONIA, Just my opinion."
5,A real adventure!!!,"The first Rollins book I read was ""Sandstorm"" and he certainly kinows how to keep someone up all night!!"
3,only read if you have nothing better to do,"ok yes this is a good book if you have spare time, such as myself being on school holidays. yes, it was well written. yes it is easy to read. no, i didnt lose interest. yes, the ending was dissapointing, or lack there-of. it seemed like rollins couldnt be bothered explaining how they got back home from the amazon so he simply stopped writing and made a separate chapter entitles ""eight months later"". yes, too many people did die. yes, i do get the point - the amazon is VERY dangerous, thankyou rollins. yes, the novel takes a slight turn towards sci-fi towards the end. yes, everything eventually does turm out ok for the characters, apart from losing about 10 of their crew and one good friend. well there you have it. if you cant be bothered reading this book, ill send you a basic story line if you email me. or you could simply read the prologue, chapters 1, 2 and 20. hope i helped you,natalie"
2,Runs out of steam big time,I have liked other Rollins' novels and this one was enjoyable for the first couple of hundred pages but it just went on way too long with too much plot repetitions. Not a worthwhile read and it may be time for me to give up on Rollins.
2,Comic Books Are Deeper Than This,"Actually Amazonia reads like an extended episode of Jonny Quest, only not as sophisticated. One of the characters (and I use the term loosely) travels with a pet jaguar. The military contingent are equivilent to Star Trek's ""red shirts"" -- expendable extras who exist only to get killed. In Amazonia, they are killed by giant mutant creatures. The sections involving an obligatory and chiched romance and the author's occasional lectures on the value of the rain forest (spare us, please) are absolutely must-skip reading.I know it's supposed to be mindless fun, but this is all a little TOO mindless. I'm a big fan of Preston and Child thrillers and this falls far short."
5,This one was fun!,"I've read almost all of his works so far -- every one of them a hoot to read. Fun, adventure, action, and this one does not disappoint!This book is HIGH on the ""Holy crap, what else can possibly happen to these guys!"" and impossible to put down.Loved it!"
4,Entertaining Read without Effort,"If you are looking for an entertaining read where you don't have to think very much, then this book might be for you. It has great detail but your belief system has to be put at bay when reading most of the science fiction, which there is more than needed; one man is fed by a tree root for almost a year. There was no mystery about any of the characters as they all turned out just as you thought they would when they were first introduced; none of the good guys turned out to be a villain. I would not classify it as a thriller since a lot of the plot was predicable, but it will keep your attention."
3,Slow start but worth getting through,"I've read quiet a few of Rollins books and enjoy them quiet a bit. I came very close to giving up on this one and ultimately I'm glad I didn't. According to my Kindle I was about 1/3 in to it before it got better.The beggining was slow, a lot of dialogue, medical talk, and little action. It took a while to feel like you were in the Amazon. In contrast I just finished Blood Forest by Jonathan Taylor and that book took me into the jungle atmosphere immediately. This lacked that.I liked the storyline, good ending, decent characters. This certainly isnt one of Rollins best, but its a decent adventure/suspense read."
1,I couldn't make it to the middle.,The book was boring and silly. I didn't like it at all and since I bought the kindle edition I can't give it to someone who might like it.
4,Amazonia (James Rollins),"I rated this novel 4 out of 5 stars, and did enjoy it quite a bit. The characters were interesting, and I would have rated it at 5 out of 5 stars, but there are some aspects to the ending that are pretty cliche and feel as if the author included them to tie up loose ends. I really liked the relationship between Manny and Tor-Tor, and Rollins does an outstanding job describing the jungle, the botany and conservation issues."
4,Scrapping good yarn!,"I'm not sure this is a classic tale in the search for lost civilizations genre, but it's not bad. A missing Special Forces soldier from the Rand Expedition returns to civilization with two arms, even though he started out with just one! He also carries a lethal pathogen of unknown origin. Scientists and Army Rangers begin an overland trek through the Amazon jungle searching for the missing expedition. Scores of mutated jungle creatures attack the folks along the way, including two 100-foot black caimans. The characterizations are mostly stilted and cliched, but if you want interesting characters read ""Treasure Island"" or ""Moby Dick."" The scientific verisimilitude is excellent, and the author keeps you turning the pages. Doyle's ""The Lost World"" it ain't, but since Michael Crichton doesn't write this stuff anymore, what are you gonna read?"
3,Another captivating novel from James Rollins,James Rollins does it again. I was hard pressed to put it down. I just had to continue reading until I got to the brilliant ending.
5,Rollins never fails,James Rollins never fails to come up with fiction with just enough fact mixed in to make you think maybe this could happen. Amazonia does just that by taking us to a place with so much unexplored area that anything could happen and does.
3,Popcorn novel with slightly tangy flavor,"This book was not exactly one that I'd recommend for everyone. It is definitely of the Crichton school of writing- take scientific issue, explore it, have people meet grisly demises, rinse, repeat - and unfortunately, not past the seventh grade in this particular school. Rollins does an excellent job with the setup and puts his heroes into big trees and throws plenty of rocks at them. However, when you surround your heroes with lots of expendable Special Units forces, I'm going to be able to pick who lives and who gets eaten by piranha frogs fairly quickly.Take a look if it is on paperback and you need a good book to get you through that plane ride."
2,Just a little research would have made it so much better,"Rollins is clearly a gifted story teller and I relished the first couple chapters. However, my appreciation for the fast-paced prose quickly went downhill after the introduction of the Army Rangers into the story. As a former army captain, I found the Rangers entirely unbelievable. Jim's depiction of them is full of implausibilities and downright inaccuracies. Page after page of mischaracterizations eroded my willing-suspension-of-disbelief until I finally put the book down unfinished. If Rollins includes military characters in future stories, I hope he does some basic research first."
5,Simply amazing!!!!!!!!!!!,Amazonia was a very enjoyable story. The body count is pretty high and more people died than I thought should. But it was an amazing book. The characterzation went very well. And it kept a good pace. This book is a hard to put down action/mystery thiller. It had many twist and turns and the best part of all was that it had a totally unexpected ending. It was kinda those stories that left you wanting more. It was very goodBUY IT BUY IT BUY IT
3,Started strong but runs out of gas,"Amazonia was exciting and interesting from the start until the middle of the book, but I thought the ending was weak and it limped to the finish line. The characters seemed to get less dimensional as the story unfolded, until by the end it was hard for me to care about what happened to them. Maybe he threw in too many characters and the focus was lost. I thought the outlandish sci-fi like elements didn't work well either, and were unnecessary (the jaguar hybrids). Still, for much of its length this book was quite thrilling, too bad it didn't sustain it."
3,Good imagination - mediocre writing,"Rollins seems to have a great imagination, but is not an engaging writer. Rewritten by someone with a talent for writing and at half the length, this would be an excellent book. Would probably make a good movie if produced by the right group."
4,Great Stringer,"Just clip one end to boat or belt and keep the unused clips at your end. I always keep just the next one open. Catch a keeper, clip it on, slide it down and open the next clip.Fish can get deep and stay healthy for hours. Great if you are releasing when you catch a better fish.I would give this 5 stars if it were still available in the softer braided cord version. The vinyl coated cable is a bit stiff and gaudy. Nonetheless, I bought three and we use them on each boat in Canada.Caution. This is a long stringer and can reach the motor. Not the best way to remove scales ... ;-)"
5,Amazing value,"This is a HUGE roll of paper! I used a very small amount to use as a roll of paper on my son's craft table. I just roll it across the table and he's got a huge area to color on, paint, whatever. It's a great weight - nice and thick to handle markers, do-a-dots, etc., but light enough that it's not hard to move or fold. I highly recommend it!"
4,Bittersweet Memories,"Whether you admit it or not, we fell in love with Nick and Jessica. If you watched every episode as it aired or missed a few, you'll love this DVD."
1,"Too little, too late","While I loved Newlyweds, I just can't stand to watch it now knowing what's going on right now with Nick and Jessica. Jessica has filed for divorce!!! Hello!! What a crappy time to put out another DVD. I had the other 2 DVD sets which I eventually sold and I'm glad I did. This show was supposed to give viewers a taste of what it's like to be married and while it did that, wouldn't it also get you thinking, ""So, all marriages evetually end in divorce..."" hmm"
1,You would be stupid to buy this Dvd!!,"Who would ever want to buy this Newleyweds Dvd, You gotta be kidding me, This show is the reason they are going to get divored! They were a normal cute couple before the show, And then Newleyweds came along and so did the fame and money which changed everything. They should have never publicised their marriage on tv, They were so desperate to get any kind of attention because their careers were going nowhere, Jessica is talentless she couldn't even make it as a singer, So she had to try another way to get any attention, Which she had to act like a dumb girl to get anykind of fame, And you stupid people bought it, She ended up with fame which she doesn't deserve at all. Let's see now with the dumb act getting old if she could make it as a real talent in hollywood , Your looks can only get you so far!!"
3,TRULY - The Final Season !,"If you pay attention during these 10 episodes you can clearly see the end coming for our favorite Newlyweds. That spark of love and affection is gone and Nick & Jessica seem to be going through the motions. They spend more time apart and Nick ALWAYS seems annoyed! I guess Jessica isn't so cute after 2 years of marriage.I don't know, maybe it was all the media coverage or maybe it was Daisy the dog or maybe Nick & Jessica just grew apart, in any event they are OVER and even though at first I thought it was hysterical that they were getting divorced, after watching the ""Newlyweds - Nick & Jessica"" DVDs I do think it's sad. I will miss the show and I will miss rolling my eyes at Jessica's ditziness.These DVDs are a must have for all Nick & Jessica fans. Let's face it, alot of us didn't really know who Nick & Jessica were until this show aired on MTV!"
4,Shame,"I thought this last release was quite bitter sweet, as we know what happened to the NewlyWeds,and it wasnt ""happily ever after"". Not as enjoyable as the first 3 seasons, but if you are a fan of the show (as I am) you will still find it entertaining. I had to chuckle when, on Valentine's Day, Jessica told Nick (sitting in a restaurant with the cardboard heart she had made for him) : ""here you are still sitting with your heart on"". Wasnt that the problem - he always had a heart on but she wasnt always in the mood for it? :-)"
2,Boring,"I half paid attention to this while I watched it. This season lacks good drama and often strays away from attracted people to the show in the first place - watching interaction of Jessica and Nick. You will spend an entire episode watching Nick fooling around with his friends on a boat in Mexico. i don't even remember where Jessica was, but it wasn't interesting either. I liked the other seasons better."
1,THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL!,"I hear that Nick and Jess are finially fessing up to breaking up. Now that's what you call a FINIAL SEASON!But.... Dizzy Blonde that she is, she does not have a pre-nup."
2,COULD HAVE AT LEAST WAITED TO BREAK UP AFTER RELEASE,WHO CARES ANYMORE... THEY COULDN'T MAKE IT LAST..
3,"NOT HIS BEST, BUT NOT BAD....","AS I FIND WITH MANY OF LUDLUM'S NOVELS, GOOD STORY THAT TWISTS, BUT IS SOMETIMES HARD TO FOLLOW. THE BOOKS GETS PROGRESSIVELY BETTER AND I LIKED THE STORY."
3,Not my favorite Ludlum but ...,"... still worth reading.The story revolves around a massive conspiracy about whether or not Hoover was murdered. The story is told in true Ludlum style, with enough intrigue and interesting characters to keep you turning the pages. The only problem I find with this book is that Chancellor always seems to make a correct guess while writing his manuscript. I would have preferred seeing the document evolve and adjust as information is uncovered.But still enjoyable."
5,Great story of 'What If?',"Every day some of us ask the question: 'What IF?' Well in 'The Chancellor Manuscript' Ludlum has a pretty big 'What If' on his hands, and it turns out to be quite a fun question to ask, too. What if J. Edgar Hoover didn't die a natural death, but was cleverly done away with...?As it turns out, we stumble on this situation quite by accident. You see, Peter Chancellor comes up with a great premise for a fictional book he plans to write. Guess what the plot is? What if Hoover was knocked off instead of going naturally? From here Peter, like any good author, begins to do some credible research before embarking upon his chore of writing--but as he digs he begins to uncover some startling revelations...maybe he really WAS killed after all... NOBODY can devise a plot that is filled SO completely and move it at the pace that Ludlum could do in his prime, and 'The Chancellor Manuscript' definitely is Ludlum at the peak of his amazing craft. Just bloody good fun."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The Chancellor Manuscript is another set of secret files. All over the place, these things. One J. Edgar Hoover had a penchant for these things, it appears.When a novel seems to become a bit too close to the truth, the novelist is embroiled in a nasty plot involving those who feel threated by their very dirty laundry being revealed."
1,Just about unfinishable bore,"The Bourne Identity by this author was great but this is a contrived, monumental bore. Intricate plotting is only worth following if the themes and characters are worthy of attention. This book is some kind of desperately single-minded, looney-left hate fest. OK, you can say Hoover was a monster, and say it again 10 times, maybe even 50 or 60 times, but that does not a book make. The world presented here is sick, but the sickness is the author's monomania."
4,The Chancellor Manuscript,The book was very good. But the Kindle edition had so many typos. It was very disappointing. Inver Brass became Liver Brass just to name one. I've never encountered this before in an Kindle edition. Hopefully the proof reading will be better. The story though was very good. It's just the quality of the Kindle edition I found disappointing.
5,a great conspirasee and spy novel,deep this is one book you can not put down and come back to dayds later there is so much going on that you have to pay attention and keep up a real mind worker and a great story always somthing happenening and a twist at every new chapter a good book.
3,Chancellor Manuscript,"The Chancellor Manuscript just seemed to take too long to take off. It seemed to lapse back into the confusing doldrums too often. This book was too easy to put down. In my opinion, this was not truly vintage Ludlum."
5,Impossible to stop reading,"This is my sixth Ludlum book, and I can't say which I prefer. I confirm my statement, this is the one that got my hands stick like with crazy glue to the book. Incredible how the writer sets all the places and persons, taking you step by step deeper into the novel. Don't miss this one, you will regret it if you do not get your hands in this novel. Ludlum is the best."
3,Disappointing ending to promising developments,"Enough said about Hoover's ""reign of terror"". What organisation Venice created should have survived his death, they are not a bunch of unorganised mob.Varak died in this book, and also in Icarus Agenda. Wow. Maybe I read an earlier version.If Venice had the files, and wanted IB to end and he carried on, he could have easily done so without going through so much trouble.This book could have been ended better."
5,Fast Shipping...Vest as expected...Xcel is a good brand,"I expected to wait at least a week or so, but received the item in about 3-4 days.I am about 187lbs and 5'11"" and the XL fits snug and perfect. Glad I didn't get the large.I bought this less for warmth and more for rash as a traditional rash guard did not protect my sternum very well. I'll try to update this review after my next surf session but I'm sure I'll be glad for a little extra warmth going into the fall (slightly cooler water conditions) in Daytona.One more thing...suggested retail per the tag was $33, and I paid $35 plus 4.95 shipping but did not reduce my stars because I could not find this item at my local surf shop and got exactly what I wanted so it was worth a few extra dollars..."
3,caution,"***Definitely be cautious about taking your kids to see this film. I'm a grown-up and some scenes were quite scary to me!***A new family moves into an old house. One of the twins discovers an enchanted book which brings to life a whole new world of goblins, fairies, and other monsters.The CGI is well done, the monsters felt very much ""alive"" and all are quite scary it's so well done. I myself jumped in my seat a few times !I didn't know this was based on a book, but should have known - with the popularity of movies like The Chronicles of Narnia, and Harry Potter, it was obvious the Spiderwick Chronicles would be adapted to the big screen. In any case, the movie made me want to read the books as I felt a lot of the action was too fast, and something was missing.Still quite an entertaining movie for the family."
1,disappointed,"We rented the movie after reading the series. We were so disappointed that it did not follow the series, left out characters, added characters that weren't even in the book, left out so much of the books. It may have been a better movie had it not been titled ""Spiderick Cronicles"" leading the viewer to believe it was a movie of the series. Would I watch the movie again? NO!"
1,Spiderwick,"Ordered this from Amazon for my grandson. I gave it to him he was pleased. After I got home 6 hr. drive from him, he informed me that it dosen't play. I assume it was because it came from Great Brit., when I get it back I will be returning it. I wish I had known that DVD's from other countrys may not play in the US. Would it be possible to let us know before we purchase them?"
4,Good movie,"It's a kool Kids movie.My Kids Like it and I also enjoy watching it,cause,there's some action that can make laugh.Good action.Beginning and ending.Good audio Sound and clear video.If You have a Movie Theater sound system,then,You would more likely enjoy it.Just bring it down the earth.You'd feel like They're coming for You."
3,Defective Bluray,"Two copies of this bluray were defective so I had to give up and get a refund. Audio would quit half way through the movie on both discs so never got a chance to watch the entire movie. I enjoyed the 1/2 movie that I saw, wish the manufacturers would get their act together. And yes I have the latest firmware for my player...Amazon sent a new copy out immediately and issued a refund when I returned both copies. Perhaps there is a recent bad batch of these out there since I have seen no one else mention this problem as of yet. My player has only had a problem with one other title which was definitely a manufacturing defect. I'll probably end up purchasing a DVD copy of this title as the family enjoyed the half we did get to watch."
3,cute movie,"The story line was great the quality was perfect. 3 stars only because of the price, would watch another if there was a series."
4,Wonderful movie,I rented this for my 7 year old grandaughter and found myself watching and enjoying as intently as she...and Im not a movie watcher. Very good movie. I'd even watch it again :)
3,Not For Book Lovers,"The movie was poor compared with the book. As a different story, it was ok. The acting & characters were good. I liked that the personalities of the characters reflected the book."
3,Spiderwick DVD,"I didn't remember this movie having been made. I saw the previews of it before another movie and thought it looked pretty good. The best I can do for the rating is a Fair. Maybe worth watching once, but not really worth buying. Would have been better as a rental, but I got it at a good price, so I can live with that. Got it in an acceptable amount of time and and appeared to be New and unopened as advertised."
5,Enchanting,"Without boring you with a long drawn out review, I just wanted to say it's a wonderful tale. It's a fastasy adventure for all ages."
5,Field Guide Edition,"The field guide version of this film is a creative way to enhance the movie and gives it more depth. It should also encourage all to read the books. Spiderwick is clearly inspired by legendary field guide authors like John James Audubon, and Roger Tory Peterson. And should encourage all amateur naturalists to explore the outdoors around their home. As well, hone in on their creative skills. Recommended for single adults!Creativity > 5 starsPlot > 4 stars"
3,The edition to get,"I got this one years ago, don't remember much about it now but know that I liked the level of detail and quality of the FX (visual effects by Tippett Studio, they do the wolves in the Twilight movies). Nick Nolte, as I recall, had only a small amount of screen time, Sarah Bolger (Irish, not American - in ABC's ""Once Upon a Time'') was thrilled to get to drive a car in one scene, and Freddie Highmore (British, not American) looked good as twin brothers (I think the extras show how that effect was achieved)."
5,I thoroughly enjoyed this film!!!,I caught this on a plane recently and loved it. It is a fabulous fantasy film for children. Totally creative and whimsical.
4,FANTASY FOR KIDS AND ADULTS. UPDATED BLU RAY REVIEW,"Young Jared finds Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide and despite the warning of ""Do Not Read"", he does so anyway. Hence, the adventure begins. Not only must Jared get his family to believe, he must fend off a horde of goblins under the command of an evil ogre! This is a complex movie with many undertones playing throughout. An excellent movie and fun for the whole family. There are some scary images that are not suitable for children under 8. Approach this with a light heart and fun in mind and you won't be dissappointed.NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Wonderful picture and sound! All special features carried over! FINAL VERDICT: UPGRADE WORTHY!"
4,"Family Style ""Cute Fun""","This film was a strong, family-fun addition to what has been a dry couple months of DVD releases. I would have liked a little more backstory on the creatures and less discussion of the family. I would have also liked to see more diversity in the creatures and preferred less reality and more fantasy. The books are filled with interesting tidbits that seem glossed over, but what can you expect from Hollywood today (they don't expect you to be able to read, after all). The film still stands well on its own. Mostly family friendly except for a couple of rough action sequences and an ill-timed, almost-profanity at the film's conclusion. Just don't expect Froud or Narnia. Recommended!"
5,Great movie for the family,"I took my boys 5 and 9 to see this movie and the three of us loved it! We actually went to see it twice in the theatre and have been waiting anxiously for the DVD. The movie was so good it inspired my 9 year old to read the whole series of books, as well as the Field Guide, the Care and Feeding of Sprites and other related books.As for it being too scarey, it wasn't. My 5 year old son loves all that is scarey, but my 9 year old son is a bit of a 'fraidy cat. He did not have nightmares or trouble sleeping after seeing the movie. It's really just a cool twist on the familair troubled family pulling together storyline that happens to take place in a fantasy setting that pulled us all in."
3,too scary and violent!!!,"The books are great but, the movie was scary and innapropriate for my eight year old who loved the books first. the trailer and the pics on the movie are misleading. It looks like a magical land with brownies, and flower fairies. We were expecting some darkness with the ogre but the whole movie was dark, with heart racing violence. It is setting children up for horror movies as they get older. It is not a good family movie unless your kids are young teenagers. On that note, the movie could be entertaining for tweens and teens. It just goes to show that books are typically always better then movies."
3,Good Movie but...,This movie is so different from the books I had a bit of a hard time enjoying it. I think had I seem this before reading the books with my kids I would have liked it better.
3,ok,"Somewhat naf. Story predictably developed. Acting ok. Whish it had been more interesting and complex. It really was like pablum, spoon fed. If you are under 5 ok."
4,Good action/fantasy movie.,"I have never read the books so I wasn't sure what this whole thing was about.I'll make it short.The good.Incredible sets,locations etc...The plot advanced at a nice pace.The music was done well.It's a good watch but not nearly in the ""Potter"" category of excellence.The bad.My only real gripe is the acting.And it wasn't just one actor, all of them gave great ""made for tv"" performances.But for a major movie like this, the acting was below standard.Is it enough to break the film?Hardly but it is a persistant annoyance throughout the movie.Otherwise...Fun and not too serious.A great movie for the family.A tad too ""Disney saccharine"" for my tastes but still worth a rental.Recommended."
4,Cute Family Movie,"Great Movie for a family movie night. I would not allow children younger than six or so watch it though, as it does have some mildly scary characters. We loved it though!"
3,In the end a very formulaic movie that does not stand out amongst the Many Fantasy Films.,"It's based on a book, of course. But unlikeThe Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Widescreen Edition)orThe Golden Compass (New Line Platinum Series Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)or of the franchise Fantasy films it does not add to the Fat genre that many believe is on the end side of its run. I would say it's a good Family movie that will run excessively on television when that time comes (Nickelodeon) To be more critical, it has sloppy, lazy CGI and the characters are pretty much your Stock characters that too many screenwriters/novelists use. A standard, average film which you should shed any expectations. I don't think I've seen a more average film for the Fantasy genre as of this year and last."
2,Not My Favorite,"It was alright, but I think the movie itself could've been better. It went way too fast in the events, I would've liked it better if had been more like the books, but even then, I've seen better fairy tales. All of you can like it if you want, I'm not stoping you, but I prefer other movies."
4,Kids movies,"Inventive, moves well, but is a bit too fanciful for my taste yet should appeal to the young. A good movie for the kids during Halloween. For me it was yet nother fantasy world vs reality flick that required me to invest my emotions in someone elses 'what if' world, (where magic and fantastical creatures are the norm), if I am to gleen any shred of enjoyment from veiwing the movie.As I said , great for the kids especially at Halloween considering the movie is full of cute, (mostly), goblin like creatures. There is redemption at the end however that gives some closure, a quality sadly lacking in the Lemony Snickets movie. This is really a good thing since the movie isn't good enough to engender a part 2, (but then, niether is Lemony Snickets)."
4,"Pass the Salt, Please.",Excellent movie but may be a little too intense for small children which is their intended prime audience. Enjoy.
5,Charming AND suspenseful!,"I loved the books, and the film is first-rate, both technically and in brilliant casting. Freddie Highmore has to be the best juvenile actor in decades, and Joan Plowright, David Strathairn, and Mary Louise Parker always add polish and professionalism to anything they touch. This film is a winner both for young viewers and for any of us older film fans who still love magic and mystery."
3,The Spiderwick Chonicles Review,"Its tried & predicable at best. The cast is bland & forgettable. The action is ok but nothing really special. The story is not great but pretty good. There's also too much yelling,shouting & anger. More then The Spoony One yelling at the Final Fantasy X2 game. The most memoralbe part about this film in my mind is when The Thimbletack changes into a boggart whenever it get angry ala Bruce Banner/Hulk. Overall,its not great but still a fun movie to watch. I give this film a 5 out of 10."
2,"Oh, shut up already.","Three pissed off, dysfunctional kids arrive at their new home, and have a screaming match. They unpack the car, and have a screaming match. The older sister, who is a bully, accuses a brother of stealing something, and there's a screaming match. Then some fairies show up and there's some good computer-generated fantasy characters, then more screaming.At minute 38, I want these three siblings to die very slow and painful deaths. Or at least have some ogre eat their vocal cords. I gave up.If you must, mute the TV and turn on subtitles."
1,Make Up Doesn't Hide an Already Ugly Face,"Too juvenile to appeal to a mature audience and yet too scary to be appropriate for a younger one. They spare no expense when it comes to beautiful CGI effects but clearly have both a sloppy screenplay and poor director. Quite a few of these actors are big names with consistently good performances so I couldn't believe their cheesy acting. I am a huge movie fan and love a good cinematic interpretation of a book and believe whole-heartedly in the director and screenplay writer's creative license to make changes to the story to better fit the screen. That said, the books really deserved better."
3,Good kids film,This is a good kids film. It is imaginative and should get your kids to show interest in books which these days is near impossible.
4,Great movie for kids!,"As an avid Fantasy fiction fan, this movie just hit all the right buttons. There were moments that I fell right into the storyline, completely forgetting that these creatures do not exist in real life. I look forward to sharing this with my son once he is old enough to appreciate movies!"
4,The Spiderwick Chronicles,'The Spiderwick Chronicles' is a pretty decent family fantasy adventure film that was actually a lot better than I expected it to be. It follows a family who move to the country and find a book that shows how to find various supernatural and fantasy creatures. They have to stop the book falling into the wrong hands and here the adventure begins. The child actors are quite good and there's none of that precocious cutsey-ness that can drive you mad in other films. The effects are great and the storyline is pretty good as well. This film is quite short at just under 90 minutes and I didn't check my watch once as I became completely captivated by the story. If you like fantasy films then this should be right up your street and makes for a great afternoons viewing when you want a bit of fun and adventure. A solid four star film and well worth a try.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
4,Good,"First of all, I just wanna say. That this cd is NOT TECHNO! More like Diva House to Progressive house. Now with that said. Im Sure if you people liked the old razor & guido rmxs, you would really enjoy this cd. Its got some good diva vocals on some of the tracks. So if you enjoy NYC House music and progressive house. This cd is a must. Enjoy"
4,More Celtia than New England,"This album conjures visions of Celtic lands rather than musical impressions of New England. Sure, the Irish and the Scots migrated to the upper eastern coasts of North America and so their music still echoes there, but rather than evoking the eclectic musical mix that came to be distinctly Americana, this music wafts from a different shore. Heavy on the squeezebox, most likely you'll imagine Irish bands and pubs before you'll imagine Ol' Nick the Sea Captain or Old Cape Cod. Well-crafted, but not what I expected. I do like this CD. It's just that I'll most likely play it when I'm in a lively Celtic mood and ready to dance the Maypole; not when I'm cooking New England clam chowder or steaming lobster and dreaming of buoys bobbing peacefully in the bay."
5,Hold on Steve...it's poetry,"So ""Steve"" from New York critiques this book of poetry as bad because it's ""based on the author's opinions."" Steve, it's poetry, by nature an art form informed by the author's opinions, ideas, emotions and worldview. Steve, have you heard of poetry? Did you really read the book, or are you just another idiot dittohead? Because I did read the book, it's well written, compelling, moving and a worthwhile read, no matter what your political leanings are."
3,It's Not All That Bad!,"I can't argue with the negative reviews, but I am somehow strangely drawn to this movie. Perhaps it is because I was in my late 20s when the movie was originally released, and I hung out with a group of friends who were somewhat similar to the characters in St. Elmo's Fire. We even hung out in a bar (Z's Sports Tap in Chicago, since torn down and replaced by a highrise building) where we were regulars. I like to think we weren't as shallow and useless as the characters in this film, but we were all trying to find our way after being out of college for a few years. Now we are all fat, with kids, living in the suburbs; so I guess the attraction of this movie is to recall our ""youth."" By the way, it does have a pretty good soundtrack. Strictly 80s!"
5,Who are we kidding...,"...if you're even looking at this movie, then you probably have seen it and, come on, let's face it - this is a classic for anyone born between 1960 and 1980. Watched just after I bought it and made me feeling 10 years younger. Just go ahead and buy it."
3,Back to the BratPack Years,"Anyone who loves the 80s movies has to watch this ... a coming-of-age movie about friendship, sticking out for one another, unlike the sex-centred teen comedies of today ... who can forget John Parr's 'Man in Motion' and David Foster's love theme instrumental? Andrew McCarthy, Rob Lowe, Emilo Estevez, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Demi Moore - need i say more ? wonderful actors/actresses in the 80s who graced the screen...great chemistry on-screen... a trip down nostalgia lane..."
1,Spend a couple hours of your life with 7 vile people,"Of all the hateful self-centered characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie, the one I found most offensive was the one involving Emilio Estevez/Andie MacDowell. Isn't stalking hilarious? And isn't Kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you've ever seen? I bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little Kirby.I also loved at the end when Ally Sheedy tells Andrew McCarthy and Judd Nelson, who have been fighting over her for the entire film, that she just wants them ""all to be friends"". To which they both reply the classic cinema line, ""Ehhhh... ok."""
2,"The ""Brat Pack"" lives up to their name","Seven recent Georgetown grads find disillusionment when confronted with ""the real world"". Realistic elements like unrequited love, faithlessness, and employment trouble are undermined by ridiculous (and unintentionally funny) dialogue. I also had a difficult time believing that these twentysomethings were already undergoing a midlife crisis. Do I watch and enjoy this? Yes. But I don't think that snickering and eye-rolling was what director Schumacher had in mind. Lowe and Moore returned the following year for the superior ""About Last Night..."""
3,Fun and Full of Heart!,"In this engaging offering, the popular Sesame Street star plays a wealthy philanthropist who opens a much-needed orphanage deep in the worst end of the Bronx. In a graceful gesture, the children give their furry benefactor the nickname, ""St. Elmo,"" only to turn on him when their new home mysteriously burns to the ground, (hence the title of the movie). Did Elmo set the fire for the insurance money, or is someone trying to frame him? A dejected Elmo must go on the lam to clear his name, and while this is clearly the most ""adult"" of the Elmo features, the entire family should enjoy this entertaining hybrid of ""The Muppet Movie"" and ""The Fugitive."""
5,Master OF The rare Laserdiscs Movies.,"I have St.Elmo's Fire ON LASERDISC And on DVD too,'tis a great Movie :)"
2,Corny Bad,"This movie is not the best, but not the worst either(that honor would have to go to Bio Dome). It's just blah. The characters are dull and the whole plot is corny in a bad way. I couldn't really feel myself identifying with any of the characters or caring what happened to them, which is one of the best parts of movies. The only good thing about this movie is the theme song by John Parr. It's an awesome song. Anyway, most of the movies with members of the Brat Pack are overrated and this one definitely fits the bill."
3,Dumb brat packery,"The Bottom Line:A movie that's too dumb to even understand what its title refers to, St. Elmo's Fire is a film about disaffected yuppies adrift after college that never feels authentic or compelling; it's not really offensive enough to warrant a lower rating, but nor does it have any material good enough to warrant a viewing.2.5/4"
1,THIS DVD IS IN GERMAN!!!,"Absolutely useless to me. The DVD is in German, and will not even play on my DVD player. What a ripoff. I just spent 10 bucks on a DVD that is going straight into the trash. DON'T ORDER FROM THIS SELLER! NO RETURNS are possible once you open the package!!!!"
4,Great Movie,"I have been very satisfied with my purchase of the movie 'St. Elmo's Fire'. I knew that I was purchasing new, but I would have rather of had a set date to expect to receive it.(I am not good with patience). It has been a great movie that I have watched several times already."
2,Not as Good as I'd Remembered,"Short review: SEF this time around seemed too outside-in and contrived plotwise to me, both with respect to the plot and its characters, several of whom seemed to be overacting. It was fun to see many of the actors (Demi Moore, Rob Lowe at the start of their careers whereas several of the other characters (Judd Nelson Ali Sheedy, Emilio Estivez...etc) seem to have vanished from sight- or, at least from my sight. Blu Ray Quality was OK, nothing more. If you have this title as a DVD I'd hang on to it and move on."
5,Great Film; Enjoyed It Thouroughly!,"I liked this film SO much! It was so well written, and so well acted too. Great movie, great actors too, I couldn't think of any other actors who could have played these characters better than they did. Well Done!"
5,A solid film,"St. Elmo's Fire captured the drama, humour and emotion of the 80's. The Brat pack was wonderful. A great way to capture the period."
4,Child of the 80's,"This is one of the ""defining"" movies of the 1980's. And with good reason. First it had almost every major 80's young star in it. If they had squeezed Molly Ringwald in there somewhere, it would have been required viewing for 80's historians.Imagine graduating from college and then suddenly everything you have prepared for falls away, leaving you hanging onto nothing. That is St. Elmo's fire. It's a legend of sailors following lights that aren;t there. I think everyone has had that moment when you can't seem to find your way. This movie bottles it and packages it. You can put it in your DVD player and watch it like a road map when you need to figure out your life.I am proud that I was a teen in the early 1980's. The so-called ""brat pack"" caught a lot of flack in the 80's, but I hold onto these films and this on in particular. I was a defining film in my life. Maybe it will be in yours too."
4,Just watched it again,"Ok first of all, I DO like this movie, BUT it is so depressing! I hadn't seen this movie since the 80's and aside from the cheesey hairstyles, clothes, this movie has a pretty deep message about growing up. One of the saddest scenes in this movie is where Rob Lowe comes back to the old frat house and is welcomed by his ""brothers"" with open arms. They end up playing a game of football and Billy (Rob Lowe) asks one of his friends if it's possible for him to get a job coaching at the college, and his friend says something like, ""yeah we need someone like you around here to get us some good drugs"". How awful! He's trying to do the right thing and constantly gets slammed and makes the wrong choices. And then of coures there's Demi Moore's charecter who is a drug addict, and the love triangle thing, it's just good but VERY SAD!"
2,Hasn't held up too well,"Well, having just watched this again for the first time since 1985, I found it pretty trite, surprisingly old-fashioned, and lacking in the script department. As usual with a big ensemble cast, the characters are all stereotypes. Rob Lowe's rosy cheeks make him seem like he should have stuck to after-school specials, even though the girls of the time loved him. Only Demi Moore's acting stands out a bit here, and, true to form, she is probably still the biggest star of the bunch almost 30 years later. Evidently this got savaged by the critics of the day. They were not wrong."
4,St. Elmos Fire,"Purchased for my favorite teen who loves 80's movies. The movie was insight into the gen X way of some, of lost and indulgent college kids. For my teen it was a affective learning experience about that generation."
1,Unbelivable ...,"I am astonished that this book might be the support material of a Harvard course...First of all, there is a massive mistake on the backcover of the book ""Jean-Francois Le Pen"" is in fact ""Jean-Marie Le Pen"". It is such an obvious mistake - it looks like a joke !But OK, let's admit it's only a translation mistake, it doesn't change the overall quality of the book.Just to let you know, the author is part of the left side of the french left wing - She is a typical example of the generation of ""soixante-huitard"" french intellectuals, who use to support the maoism if not the stalinism."
4,...,"I've just finished reading this and i'm a little shellshocked. Not because I feel Grant has been villified but perhaps merely because it shows such a debonair and enigmatic idol of mine as a true fallible human being.Like the other reviewer commented, I too thought it seemed to be written with a fair amount of objectivity. It did not come across to me as a bitter and delibrate attempt to trash or undermine Grant. It does come across, however, as a bit of a tacky and harrowing romance novel, even the presentation of the book conveys such an image.I think if you're a Cary Grant fan that wants to find out a little more about Archie Leach and is willing to accept the fact that their view of Cary may be tarnished in the process; then go ahead and read this, it is an interesting and (from what I can tell) balanced read.Let's all hope he was happy in the end."
4,Great Book,"I felt like I knew Cary Grant much better after reading this book. It seems to have been written with some objectivity. The book makes you feel as though you are right in the middle of their relationship. I really enjoyed reading about the details of the most dashing man of the classic movie era. There will never be another Cary Grant, unfortunately."
3,Good patterns -- bad book design,"This book has adorable, as-yet-untried-by-me, knitting patterns, but one of the worst designs I have seen. The front of the book has lovely photos of each pattern clumped together with text on them in big letters which gives the name of the design and ""See Page such and such,"" which, in many cases fade into the photo. The bigger problem arises when you are looking at the pattern, which tells you the number of the page of the photo -- but the photo pages are not paginated at all which makes that useless and makes you have to count backwards from the first pattern page (page 36)."
3,Cute Patterns- Bad Instructions,"I made the pig booties which certainly turned out cute. However, the pattern lacked a tension gauge (which is as fundamental as needle size) and didn't have any diagrams to show the knitter how to piece the body of the bootie together. Her patterns are really adorable and I would buy the book again. But if it ever gets into reprint adjustments should be made."
4,Good mitts,"these mitts are good enough for my boxing training, but, are not professional punch mitts, you have to pay more if boxing is your favorite sport!!! I think Everlast have products for all training levels, these are for beginners or amateur boxers... worth what you pay."
5,mitts,"These mitts are really good, they are light and comfortable. i use them 4 times a week and so far they have been durable."
3,Adequate,"These mitts serve the purpose for which they were intended, however, the finger dividers are hard to navigate so the fit isn't always quite right. They are small in size and the lack of an elastic-velcro band sometimes causes them to shift or come off after sweating in them for a few rounds."
4,Apple Picking Fun,"As an early childhood educator, I found this book to hold the attention of children ages 3-5 years old. The clear and colorful illustrations blend well with the simple text, as a day in the orchard picking apples is embarked upon by several friends. I especially liked the descriptions of the various types of apples and was able to bring those particular apples to my classroom for hands on exploration. I will use this book for many years to come in my classroom and would recommend it to other early childhood teachers."
1,"Unafraid Mary, The Lineage of Grace",I was very disappointed in this book. I am a Catholic & felt that the author went out of her way to demean Mary. I found her portrayal offensive & contradicting much of what is in the Bible. This will be the last book of hers that I will buy.
1,Unafraid: Mary...I'm afraid could not be finished.,"Ms. Rivers portrays Mary the Mother of Jesus as an often angry, pushy and even prideful woman. She obviously has issues with Mary, Jesus' Mother. While I have another of Ms. River's books that was given to me, I do not have much interest in reading it as I feel her credibility has been compromised with the writing of this book. In addition to demeaning Mary, there are many inaccurate presentations throughout the book."
5,Unafraid: Mary (The Lineage of Grace Series #5),This whole series is worth reading. Francine Rivers has a talent for bringing new light and life to people God tells us about in the Bible.
3,Not the best book in the series,"I thought that the other books (especially UNSPOKEN) were better than this book. I can't really explain it, other than to say that Mary wasn't necessarily likeable, and the other kids were brats.I think that Ms. Rivers took chances in narrating Jesus' life during the ""missing years"" that aren't explained in the Bible. The healing of Anne, and the relationship with Joseph, and his brothers. I almost felt sorry for the family after Jesus became ""KNOWN"" because he left them and didn't necessarily acknowledge them.I didn't particularly like the way the book ended--but maybe that's the Catholic in me :-) But it was a good way to finish the series, since the other 4 books were leading up into it.I would highly recommend this series."
2,quick delivery,"good where delivered quickly but CDs where not clear at the end,,(both disc 1 and 2 scratch)"
5,Could Hardly Put it Down!,"I enjoyed this book a lot. It gave an almost perfectly accurate description of the life of Mary and Jesus. It gave personal insight on Mary's thoughts and fears. This is the first book of the series that I have bought so far, so I couldn't compare it to the others. But if it is as good as this one, I should highly recommend all 5 books."
4,Very interesting!!!,I thought this book was a wonderful portrayal of Mary and how as the mother of Christ she felt. Often I have read the Bible and have wondered how Christ was as a child. I think the book was well written and very interesting.
4,The Story of Mary,"This is the final book in the Lineage of Grace Series. It must have been the most difficult one to write, as it is the story of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Her story is so well-known and oft-repeated that even the most casual Bible reader is familiar with it. As usual Rivers fleshes out the Biblical accounts with more emotional and everyday incidents. In this case she reached a bit further and wrote some incidents which were never recorded in the Bible but which could have happened within the context of Jesus' character. She emphasizes the maternal feelings which Mary had for Jesus, and her sadness at ""losing"" him to his ministry. This book does not succeed as well as the others in the series, but is a noble effort and does give the reader some food for thought about what might have been."
1,AWFUL!,If I could have rated this with less than one star I would have. This book of Rivers is so bad that I am forcing myself to finish it (simply because I don't like to start a book and not complet it.) River's portrayal of the Blessed Mother is false and disrespectful at times. I would not recommend this book to anyone I know.
3,Unafraid to Say,"Unafraid&#8213;Mary""All eternity had been waiting for this moment.she responded in simple obedience to God's call.""Mary was given a difficult task. To carry the Son of God in her womb, to raise Him, and then to watch Him die the cruelest death in all of history.In Unafraid, Mary must learn that her son, the Messiah, wasn't meant to overthrow the Roman kingdom, but rather to die....for her and everyone else.I'm unafraid to say it was a little slow. :/"
4,unafraid,"I absolutly loved this book! It really made Mary and Joseph into real people for me. The kind that struggle,want,and dream. Not just story characters. Lets face it all our lives when we think about Mary and Joseph they are seen as legendary people,far away and removed from our daily struggle. This book helped me realize how wrong that thinking was, how amazing is it that when God told Joseph to pick up and go he did, not the next morning right then. He didn't question what he was told or wonder if he was crazy he had faith, and Mary faced the scrutany of her family and neighbors most of her life waiting, not always truly understanding for Jesus to make Himself known. These were real people and this book truly touched on the heart of that"
3,Disappointing,"I read the entire Lineage of Grace series and was thrilled with the other books, but this one was disappointing. I am a protestant and do not believe that Mary was sinless, but Francine Rivers made Mary out to be a complaining, and pushy mother. It is interesting that the author did not dwell on the sins of the other women in the series, eventhough we know that they were sinners. But, she chose to dwell on Mary's sins. I believe she was trying to make a point, which I agree with, but she took it too far."
3,White Huntress,"I have been seeking this film for some time, but was unhappy with the actual film, shortened by some seven minutes, and not up to the standard as I recall, lurid cover, of a non-existent scene, and in grey rather than black & white. Better than no souvenir of the performers, but not an ideal memory of the now late artistes."
5,this cd is classic,this cd brings out the best in us all. i used to own this cd but lost in a move but all i gotta say is when ever i listen i wanna move around cause it really brings out the adrenline in me
5,FiFi BABY .........,THIS BAND IS FROM 1996 & SO HARD TO BELIEVE. A LOST ALBUM FROM MOST OF THE PUNK WORD. FiFi IS A THROWBACK FROM THE GREAT PUNK BANDS OF THE 80's.WORTH EVERY PENY. FIND IT BUY IT.AND ROCKOUT.
1,Silver Jackass Is Henseriffic,"My friend Mark first clued me in to this book. He is really into Jackasses, in fact he is one himself. Considering the fact that Mark is the all-time PHATtest jackass around how could I go wrong? It was really a terriffic book - I especially enjoyed the part the illustrated mark's family tree.There were even some extra bonus bits of jackassedness that I didn't even know about.For instance did you know that Mark has his own recording company?Overall this is a great read for anybody who ever wanted to know more about the world's biggest jackass!"
1,...,"Mindless dribble with feeble musical abilities targeted to those equally feeble minded. HEY SUAVE LEARN TO PLAY GUITAR....what are you missing fingers of just an underachiever??? Bland melodrama... if your looking for virtuosity keep looking. Compelation neither made me think or challenge my intellect. Some Like it some don't, I don't.Word to your mutha"
5,Best Sled I've Ever Owned,"My family has owned one of these for at least 4 years now. I taken it off many jumps and find that it's the only sled I fit in well, I'm about 6' 2"". Unfortunately, the sled did finally crack when I went off a jump with two other people and went down nose first. Fortunately, we have pictures of the whole thing. I spent about twenty minutes online looking for something to replace the sled with and when I found that I can replace it the same model I jumped at the opportunity. What a brilliant sled."
1,The brief Thomson Handbook,The Brief Thomson Handbook that i recently ordered has a lot of damages and almost fall apart.
2,WAHL 7060-700 Bump Free Performance,"This shaver works fairly well when using on the face, however when usedto remove short hairs around the neck it fails. My Remington ES-1000 outperforms the WAHL 7060-700 drastically in all aspects. I only broughtthe WAHL model because the Remington es-1000 has been discontinued."
1,Disappointed,"I really wanted this product to work because I am tired of using an Edger or Magic Shave. I like this razor, but it only cuts about 80% of my facial hair. It cuts the lip and chin area perfectly, but under the chin and the sides it simply does not cut completely. I have tried everything, every angle, nothing works. The instructions said to give it three weeks which I did to no avail. I tried to return and now they are giving me a hard time because I followed the instructions and used for three weeks. Buy at your own risk."
5,Jus wat i've been looking for in a electric shaver,"Excellent shaver ! A lil loud but works very well. I use it to shave my face ,head & neck. I use clipper 2 get my hair low as possible then go over it with these shavers. Im very pleased wit this product & not affect by hair bumps like when i tried other electric shavers or shaving razors. Just follow the instructions & im sure u will be pleased."
2,Lousy,The razor doews not give a close shave. I don't have a heavy beard and this thing does not cut my whiskers. One should try before buying
1,Save Your money,Not a good product for me. I'll never buy another. Total waste of money. Does not shave close at all. Leaves as much hair as it removes. Too much irritation. I tried it with and without preshave. I get much better results with the Norelco H8000 series.
4,Pretty Good,"I just got this in the mail today and gave it a try. I got a decent shave in just a few minutes. It is noisy and does vibrate a lot, but it's an electric, so that's to be expected. I have yet to try the trimmer, but it seems overall to be a good shaver. It's not quite as close as a blade, but until I can find a barber who still knows how to use a straight razor, it'll do."
1,Don't Buy This Product!,"I bought the Bump-Free Shaver figuring that if it works for men who get razor bumps when they shave, it'll work for me. After all it's supposed to be easy on the skin/face. Right? Come to find out it doesn't cut at all. And thats with just a few days of hair growth. Which in my case doesn't amount to a lot of facial hair. My barber uses a different type of Wahl electric foil shaver and it cuts just fine. Next time I see him, I'll ask him where he bought that one."
2,Not for me,"I ordered this to replace a previous Wahl Bump-Free Shaver. The shaver I wanted is discontinued. The edger part of the shaver was too sharp for my skin, it pulled and grabed the skin. It may work for you but not for me.J. Jackson"
5,WAHL SHAVER--NONE BETTER,I can't imagine a better shaver on the market at any price. I've used Wahl electric shavers for at least 10-15 years and every one I've purchased has been great. This new one is just as great as the several others I've owned through the years.
1,Wahl Bump Free Shaver,This shaver was for my husband. It was returned because it did not live up to what it's advertised as.
5,excellent,Brought for my son he specifically asked for it. He had one before and said he wanted another because it shaves very close and he doesn't get bumps. He is very happy with it. I could only find it anywhere so I am glad for amazon.com.
5,Wahl Shaver is best value,"Lightweight, easy-to-hold shaver provides and extremely smooth and close shave, with never any irritation.I am pleasantly surprised at the superiority of this model compared to my previous Wahl shaver and other dreadfully inadequate shavers such as Norelco, and even the expensive Braun."
2,Wahl shaver,We got shaver and the mini shaver hardly worked with a battery so we sent it back. Did not test the shaver itself
2,Vibrates like a jackhammer.,"I bought this product because it was made in the USA. And because of that especially I really wanted to like it. I bought this as a second shaver to keep at work. It does not do any better of a job than my Norelco at home, which is not saying much. But the real issue I have with it is that its vibration level is VERY pronounced. Its not really comfortable to use for a full shave.The shaver comes was a seperate small battery operated trimmer. That trimmer actually works great, especially for running off a AA battery. But I bought this thing for the shaver and its just not that good at all."
2,Unhappy,"I was very unhappy with this product. I was unable to get a close shave despite using a electric pre-shave face lotion. It pulled at my facial hairs and I needed to press harder than usual against my face to get any type of sufficient shave. I purchased this product to help eliminate the few razor bumps on my face. It only served to irritate my face even more. To top it off, part of the shaver's exterior screen broke off. I would have asked for a refund, if I had not misplaced my receipt."
4,Worth the Money,"The shaver actually performed just as I was informed it would. As an African-American male I needed a shaver that would give me a close shave, but not so close that it would cause irritation or ingrown hairs.The reason for not giving it five stars is because it's has to be by far the loudest shaver I've ever used."
5,Exceptional Service and a quality product,This was my first time buying a product from Amazon online. I was pleased with the service that I received. I was also pleased with the product I purchased. It was given as a gift and it was well received. It worked just the way that product should have worked.Thank you
1,Horrible product!!,My facial hair is very curly and this shaver does a poor job on curly hair. POOR JOB! Leaves patches of hair on your head and face.
2,"disappointed,?????????","Used twice, first shave was close and comfortable,second i bumped worse than with a 4 blade razor, returned for refund. Now, I have been using an old Norelco Rotary that never gave me bumps, I used it with theBump off Face And Beard conditioner that I bought to use with the walh and........Bumps everywhere on my face. Now I don't think the Wahl was that bad and will probably get another and try without The Bump Off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Big Disappointment,"I bought this shaver to accompany my husband when he is admitted to a nursing home, which required an electric shaver. His old one was getting ineffectual, so on his barber's advice I ordered a Wahl. It arrived in fine shape, but when I turned it on, it was so noisy it startled me and upset my husband whose Alzheimer's makes him fearful of loud noise and dictates the nursing home for him. I put cotton in his ears and tried the shaver. It removed nothing but the shortest hairs. Longer ones missed previously would not budge. So it sits in the closet, a new razor that will never be used. Amazon's accepting a return if unopened is of no use to me. My experience was NOT a good one."
3,Wahl - a mystery...,I purchased this rechargeable shaver because I couldn't find much else available anywhere. My dad likes the Wahl brand and has owned several models over time. But then this brand disappeared from all the places he usually buy it from and I had to search for one. I found this one for him and bought it. It is not a very fancy one and is a lower grade model than he has ever purchased in this brand. The casing is just plastic and it feels cheap. But it is dong the job and doing it well. It is the best I was able to find and I hope it lasts.
1,never got it,i never received mine UPS lost it. i filed a claim and now they are talking to amazon about replacing it. so until i get it i honestly cannot give a good review.
3,Whal Shaver,"Can't exactly say its bunp-free cos after the first few usages, I couldn't stop the bumps from coming. I guess it's an indvidual thing. The battery lasts quite long enough after a full charge. Easy to operate."
3,Decent Shaver,"The Wahl Bump-Free Shaver is a nice shaver for those who cannot use your typical razor, however the trimmer portion of the shaver is somewhat useless still have to use my trimmers."
3,"It's Okay, but could be better.","I have tried the Wahl Bump-Free shaver for nearly three weeks now. I am just now starting to get the close shave that it supposed to give, but there is a catch. You have to use it when your beard is stubbly and very short, not thick, as I have curly hair. It will not cut long beards as effectively, and I had to shave with a disposable razor to get the close shave that I want after using the shaver. Also, this is the first shaver that I have used with a hypoallergenic/microthin foil. I have noticed some pink lines on my right cheek and a small dent which could have come from my using the shaver and trimmer to take off some of the hair, as it is a bit sharp. The good news is that there are no shave bumps to be found, but I'll still keep using it as it takes a while to get a close shave with it."
2,Not What Was Described,"Did a lot of research in trying to decide whether or not to even start using an electric shaver instead of the clippers that I've been using for the last 15 years. Decided to try this shaver based on other review and testimonies, but was disappointed with the results after first use. Product did not come close to providing a ""close"" shave. Returned it and purchased a Norelco 8000 series shaver and immediately upon first use, got the closest shave I've had since I stopped using depilatories."
1,Major let down.,"I was really excited about this shaver so I could shave twice a week for work. This shaver barely shaved any hair, i even tested it on my arm hair and it too nothing off. Being an African American male I suggest Andis T-liner[[ASIN:B000143C0K Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer] to shave and use rubbing alcohol] to prevent bumps."
1,Lawnmower for my face,"I have used a Remington Black Men's Electric Shaver for over 5 years with great results. The only problem is they don't make it anymore as far as I can tell and my current one has a nick in the screen that scratches my face. So I tried this bump free Wahl. It basically did not do as advertised. It was supposed to trim the whiskers above the surface so that they don't curl back in under the skin like lift and cut or close shave razors do. This Wahl basically took off a top layer of skin and lifted pulled and chewed out most of my whiskers while just laying some down without cutting them at all.I've decided to go to the disposable type black men's bump control razor I can get at Walmart. While it takes me a little longer to shave than electric, it is doing the type of job my old Remington did.Hope this helps. If you want bump control for curly facial hair, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
2,It Didn't Work For Me,"This shaver just doesn't shave close enough, and I got more razor bumps thanwhen I used the Bump Fighter manual razor blade. I used the Wahl as directed, and even with an anti bump cream, I got ingrown hairs. The shaver is well made, and it easy to use, but was a disappointment.The one scenario where it fares well is shaving with the Bump Fighter razor on one day, and then using the Wahl the next 2 days as soon as I wokeup. If my beard/moustache had minimal growth (<24 hours) it worked decently.By the 4th day though the razor bumps were returning."
2,Waste of money,It doesn't give a clean smooth shave and it's a waste of money with the loud noise that it makes.
4,effective,"These hose are effective. I got them after noticing a few vericose veins starting during my pregnancy. I first tried some thigh highs in another brand (bought from a medical supply store) that kept falling down. The Jobst stays up pretty well, and after wearing them almost every day for the last few months, I have not developed any new vericose veins. They are not particularly comfortable, and are a pain to get on and off, but I'm pretty sure that's necessary for them to work properly."
1,Quality: Not what they used to be,"Jobst used to be amazing... the first pair I purchased got runs in the toes and crotch, which I couldn't figure out since my toes are always manicured. I thought perhaps I ordered the incorrect size, so I ordered the next size up and the same thing happened... for $70.00 these pantyhose should not have these issues especially when they're reinforced. Called the sellers and they would not stand behind the product."
4,"Jobst quality, wish the tummy were higher","I am 5'3"" and wore these on a plane at 5 months and the tummy panel felt like it wasn't quite high enough. It kept slipping down a few inches but I still much prefer these to the thigh-highs. Other than that small issue, these felt wonderful and really combated fatigue."
1,"Low Quality, High-Priced, and Uncomfortable!","I know compression stockings aren't the most comfortable things to wear, but comparing these to the Gabriella brand, these are horrendous! They keep falling down, and they are also hot and thick. And you would think that by being thicker that these stockings would hold up better--NOT TRUE. Mine got a run in them just the SECOND day I wore them, and then a few days later, they got a huge tear in the ankle. As for effectiveness, I suppose they do the job alright, but taking everything else into consideration and by comparing these with the Gabriella brand (which is WAY cheaper, lighter, and sturdier), they aren't worth it. Buy the Gabriella brand (be warned though, you'll need firm compression to work the same as the medium compression in Jobst does). You'll save yourself a good $20 and you'll be much more comfortable!"
2,Underwhelming Mexican Film,"The trailer for this film unfortunately paints a portrait that is more interesting than the movie itself. I was encouraged to watch the movie after realizing that it starred Vanessa Bauche, promotion for this particular film was strong considering her performance in Amores Perros (as Gael Garcia Bernal's love interest).The result was a disappointing attempt at a coming of age story, which was both predictable and with no standout cinematography. The plot holes and conclusion to the film also left me unsatisfied with it as a whole. I was happy with Vanessa Bauche in Amores Perros, and was thus disappointed when her first big break as a lead actress was in a film that didn't deliver (by no real fault of her own). My suggestion is to consider renting this movie before buying it, as it doesn't represent quality Mexican cinema."
4,Perfect for the iPad!!,"I'm a longtime user of Manhattan Portage's products and when I got my iPad, I wanted the perfect minimalist's accessory to carry it around the City. THIS is it! Perfect size for the iPad and one or two books, notebooks, folders, binders, etc. Enough pockets for cables, wallet, sunglasses, iPhone, etc. It's lacking that fifth and elusive star in my rating because the front flap pocket is open to the back part of the bag (the part that rests against you when you carry it). So whenever I open the flap, some of the things slide down into that section. It's a nice option, but I'd prefer for that to be sewn shut. Other than that, PERFECT."
3,an OK book,"I was disppointed about the book in general. It wrote about stories of answered prayers but all the stories are pretty much the same. After read half of the book, I lost interest in it."
5,A valuable resource for this tumultuous year,"Good book about important time. I took many notes as reminders of that year, many lessons we've forgotten and many that younger readers don't know about, e.g. cost of Vietnam War was $30 billion/year(put that into current day dollars and it's way up). And in '68 alone 14,589 U.S. military casualties. Covers situations leading to disturbances in many places beyond the U.S. For a different perspective, I recommend my book ""On the Road in '68: A year of turmoil, a journey of friendship,"" about my 6-months low-budget travels that year to 27 countries, including the hotspots of Cambodia and Vietnam.On the Road in '68: A World of Turmoil, A Journey of Friendship"
3,Up and down,"I've actually read this book before, and it's a fun and page-turning read if you like this kind of thing. Some aspects became repetitive and cliché - like the constant references to hair length and and number of Jewish radicals in different movements from Poland to France to the US. There's also an unseemly amount of attention to the Columbia student takeover and the Yippie! activists, somewhat peripheral players. The condensed historical backgrounds to certain 1968 moments - the miniprimers on the history of feminism, civil rights, Poland, and Mexico - are the most interesting part.On the other hand there is a huge whopping lie that the communists took power in Czechoslovakia peacefully (google Czech Coup 1948). That casts suspicions on the rest of the book. It's good that this book has an unhidden leftist slant, instead of a kind of anodyne false objectivity. It's NOT ok that there's a bald-faced lie."
3,"Yeah, right...like O.J. could have gotten into Cal","The author states on page 19 (of 381) that on January 1, 1968, a huge crowd watched O.J. Simpson rush for the University of California against Indiana in the Rose Bowl. Sorry, but unlike the other heroes in this book, Mr. Simpson didn't spend the 60s in Berkeley - he played for USC, way down in LA.Despite that glaring error, this book was an interesting read about a time on which anyone culturally literate today must be aware. The history is well-balanced between what happend in the U.S. and Europe, and the chapter on Mexico in 1968 revealed information that was new to me. The chapter on the 1968 democratic convention was also very informative.I recommend this book to anyone with a general knowledge of the late 60s who wants a good review of important events of that time."
3,So-So,"Receives three stars for covering an interesting set of events that are often neglected. Receives only three stars for overly romanticizing the student-led movements in the West to the point of trivalizing the bravery of those in the Communist bloc and elsewhere. If you're an aging and nostalgic hippy/New Lefter, you'll like it. If you're honest, perhaps not."
3,1968,I didn't go beyond page 18 of Mark Kurlansky's 1968 because I wonder about the veracity of the content. Pages 16 through 18 deal with Palestinians (a subject I know) and contain much misinformation due to his not consulting Arab sources in English.
1,This is a pop-history book,"Kurlansky's commendable attempt to analyze turmoils of 1968 fails because of his unobjective leftist bias, and lack of deep background historical knowledge about the countries where the events took place. His claim that after World War II, communists in Poland built ""from the rubble of society that became a nightmare"" a society ""of greater social justice"" is simply historically incorrect. His obvious anti-Polish sentiments allow him to say, without pointing to any sources, things that are manipulation of history.A writer who picks a historical topic that in itself may guarantee a bestseller book, has a basic obligation to follow truth."
3,Intriguing Ideas,"This is an account of the many turbulent events that took place around the world in 1968. In addition to what happened in the US that year (assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy, student protests, LBJ declining to run for another turn, the rise of Nixon, etc.), Kurlansky sheds the spotlight on the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Summer Olympics in Mexico City, and incidents in Poland, France, and Spain. Most of this book was well written and informative, but Kuransky's account of the year didn't grip me as much as I had hoped. Admittedly, I found the parts about Poland and other European countries of little interest, and would have liked more detail about the ramifications of what happened in the US during that tumultuous year. Whatever the case, there was some element missing from this book that kept me from becoming gripped by the accounts that were described."
3,Good summary of 1968 -- bad edit,"Kurlansky's writing is easy-going as always. However, there are way too many errors in the book. Willy Brandt was not Mayor of Berlin when the Schah came for a visit; the following demonstration was Benno Ohnesorg's first ever etc. A bit more care could be expected, I think. Unfortunately, there are also errors when Kurlansky attempts to translate newspaper headlines and the like into English. Its pop-history, I guess."
4,Enjoyable horror,"Amityville-It's About Time is a fun movie for horror fans. The Amityville Horror is back again, this time encompassed in an antique clock with a sinister history. I don't know why, but I found this movie unintentionally hilarious, the father of the family gets bit by a dog and slowly goes mad-as the result of his proximity to the ""cursed"" clock of course! The teen daughter turns seductive-also a victim of the clock's doings. The neighborhood psychic is the only one who seems like she can help...I liked this movie a lot, but I am perplexed by the ending. What exactly happened there? I don't want to give things away so I won't say more, but it is rather confusing."
3,Demonic clock thriller passes the time.,"A clock possessed with some of the evil from the cursed house in Amityville wreaks havoc on an unsuspecting family. This low budget thriller manages to mix some surprisingly entertaining moments in with the expected hokem. Recommended to bad b-movie buffs, those wanting a quality ghost yarn should look elsewhere."
2,About Time for This?,"Everything goes wrong in this 6th (Yes, 6th) installment of the ""Amityville Horror"" series. Bad script, acting... no suspense & average special effects. An Unsuspecting suburban family buys a mantel clock (guess what... it's possessed) and then awful/dumb things start to happen. The opening sequence is gripping, but the movie starts going downhills after that.Skip It."
2,Poor sequel,"Fifth instalment of the Amityville series and quite easily the worst of the series. The acting is what caught my eye most of all- poor, unconvincing unknowns were just, it seemed taken off the street with someone prompting the script to them through the film. The effects, I expected would have been a little more improved since Amityville's predecessors but they still had a very cheap look about them. On the positive side this film is watchable, but overall, all we are seeing is a repeat of the famous, eerie Amityville house we have seen in the last four films."
2,Amityville sequel gets a below average dvd realease....,"I know this wasn't a classic movie by any means but I do think it deserved a better dvd treatment than this. During the last fifteen minutes or so this quality of this dvd release gets worse and worse.Let's see we have;frame freezes,skipping,I couldn't even read the ending credits,why???? Because the last scene skipped to the end of the credits and froze. The picture also breaks up into pixels and the frames freeze between scenes. All for the low price of..... This movie deserved better than this.I can't believe Lions Gate would do a ""shoddy"" job like this. Do yourself a favor keep your crappy vhs copy and save your money for something else. Its too bad cause Lions Gate usually do a nice job on their dvds...."
3,"Not at all scary, but gory fun","This one is not based on a true stroy, but for some reason it has fun horror humor. A possessed clock turns a nice home into a haunted house."
2,"Evil, Curses, Possessions, Clocks","Could all those horrible movies be blamed on the simplicity of a mere clock? Head of the family brings home clock that possess father and daughter and kills anyone who tries to stop it. One of the best in the series at times just tries too hard to hold our interests firm, even dressing down a few cast members. Not much potential any way you look at it."
4,"""Makes you jump out of your shoes every 5 minutes!""","This is a classic Amityville. If you have seen one, you've seen them all. I personally like this selection of movies because there is no particular order you have to watch them in. This is a definate thriller, but there is no true plot."
1,Proof that some people will buy anything...,"This is the perfect gift for that special someone that you absolutely hate. Wait until you see the look on their face when they open ""Lohan Holiday,"" only to find out you have lost the receipt."
1,The worst,I have to say I paid $.49 for this on sale and feel that I overpaid! I knew that it would be cheesy but I love almost all holiday music even the cheesy pop versions (yes I like pop lol) so I figured that since I wasn't picky it would be fine. Well I was wrong. This cd is absolutely horrible. It's not torture per say but there is not even one song on it that I like. I know that everybody has different tastes in music but am still SHOCKED that this cd has some 4 and 5 star ratings. They must be relatives :P
1,wow... and not in a good way,"This album sounds like it was recorded over a karaoke machine. Actually, I've heard better karaoke singing. She can't really hold a note or a key."
1,so yeah its that bad.,she completley butchered silent night! one of my favorite christmas songs. i think when following in your sisters footsteps to get famous just skip the bad singing and go right into drugs. it's a lot easier.
4,Easy listenin' christmas music..,"I don't know why other reviewers are trashing this cd.She's not a professional singer by no means, but this is a very nice addition to my christmas music collection.She has some nice old favorites as well as some new music on here.And I'm sure she sings alot better than the people that are trashing her."
3,"It's not great, but it's not too bad either","OK, so Ali isn't the best singer ever. She can't sing as good as her sister, even. But you've gotta admit, this is a fun album that will get you in the Christmas spirit. ""Christmas Day"" is a really good original song. ""I Like Christmas"" is kind of cheesy though. ""Lohan Holiday"" is good, but I don't get it. It just says a billion million times: ""Come let me take you on a Lohan holiday, a very special place that's oh so far away."" This album isn't the best, but give Ali a break! It's a good, fun effort."
4,overview,"There is a reason why it's a bestseller. Hollywood, guns, Oprah, death threats; in short, Thank You for Smoking, covers everything America idealizes in this raucous account of Nick Naylor's profession as chief spokesman for the Academy of Tobacco Studies. Compared to Hitler, satan, Stalin, and other proteges of evil, Nick struggles (with a cigarette constantly at his lips) to beat back the wave of neo-Puritanism sweeping the nation. His hilarious escapades, often underscored with scathing insights by the narrator, lead to a climactic finish. Christopher Buckley, also author of, Little Green Men, has thoroughly researched the hot topic of tobacco and has added all the unexpected twists and jokes of a true craftsman. an enjoyable, intriguing, quick read that might just make you reach for a pack of your favorite cigarettes, even if you don't smoke."
4,Unique Story Line,"This was a good page-turner. The dialog can be a little weak, but the story-line was different. It's nice to have a suspense novel whose plot isn't based on a drug smuggler, a law firm, a serial killer, etc."
5,Disturbingly funny,"I went out and bought this book after seeing the author on MSNBC's ""Hardball"". His deadpan style and the satiric nature in which he described the book really piqued my interest.Thank You For Smoking is a quick, easy read. Christopher Buckley pokes fun at all involved - tobacco, firearm and alcohol lobbyists, politicians, hollywood producers and actors. The result is a gripping, disturbingly hilarious look at Washington DC and its pay-to-play lifestyle. Nick Naylor, the star of Buckley's farce, is an anti-hero for the ages. He's suave, manipulative, and fights to keep people smoking. Unfortunatley for Nick, he's got enemies and they'll do just about anything to get rid of him.Upon finishing the book, I wanted to read it again, a rarity for me, but it speaks for the quality of this book. If you like a good dark comedy, I recommend reading this book. It'll have you laughing in no time."
5,Fabricate Your Own Opinions,"This book spoke to me. I am a smoker, and I do not condone it to ANYONE, knowing how bad it is for you. this book does not condone smoking either, rather it is a satirical commentary on how ridiculous it is that people attack everything. The truth is, most smokers know how bad it is for you, just as most thrill-seekers know the risk of them dying in a terrible accident. Personally, I don't care. So, before anyone denounces this book as a book advocating death (I told someone I was reading it and they called it that), read the book. See for yourself its true purpose. I loved it."
3,Good - not great,"A pretty funny book and a nice light read but that's it (for better Buckley humor see 'God is my Broker'). It's hip to like Buckley these days. Similar to Dave Barry reviews, the exaggerated praises wear a bit thin over time ( e.g. 'I laughed out loud for weeks', etc). His 'look at me, I'm inside the beltway' act is also getting tired. All this being said, I still recommend this book - just not the accompanying hype."
4,Thank you for smoking.,"This book opens a window into the world of politics and the ""art of lobbying"". It also shows you how some people can ""frame"" or ""disguise"" an issue as if it were closely related to The Bill of Rights. Overall, a very funny book!"
4,Nicotine for your eyes,Good read. Didn't alter my view on the topic in anyway but kept me happily pre-occupied for a good while.
2,Not as Expected,"Reading this book was required for a class that deals with how logic and persuasive techniques can be used in compliance. Based solely on that aspect, Thank You for Smoking delivers. But what it doesn't do is reveal the ""secrets"" of the tobacco industry as much as it would seem. The pages, even whole chapters are filled with this mindless dialogue which is very irritating to read. Seriously there are pages and pages of which two people talk back and forth over mostly irrelevant topics. I would estimate this comprises nearly half of the book. When the tobacco industry is actually talked about it is interesting and entertaining but for I feel its not worth the effort."
1,Nopers,"Not a good book at all. Heavy-handed, obvious. If you want to read a real satirical writer, try Vonnegut or Swift or Twain."
2,Surprised,"I was unpleasantly surprised by this book.Reading it before I saw the movie, I didn't like it.With a lack of dialogue, it seems that the the story moves slowly, not really going anywheree.One of the only things I did like about it was the subject matter, drawing readers in to something they see regularly in Washington. I wasn't happy with the lack of character interaction, there was definetly alot more telling by Buckley than showing, he needed to let the story just tell itself throught dialogue and character interaction.I was really expecting something better in this book."
1,"Smarmy, Trite, Dated","There's nothing clever, insightful or entertaining about this novel. It's regurgitated College Republican pabulum that won't appeal to any intelligent person over the age of 22. The characters are two-dimensional cardboard cliches of DC reporters, lobbyists, and politicians along the lines of ""Bullworth."" Cynical adolescent smarm that will only intrigue those with the most rudimentary knowledge or education regarding politics."
4,"Funny, sappy, and sexy!!!","So this is a typical 80s chick flick...but, having said that, it's also really funny. The exchanges between Belushi and Lowe will keep you laughing. Women and men will also feel a kinship to the main relationship on the screen, to the comfort levels involved with different levels of intimacy, of relationships, from dating to moving in together. Funny, sappy, and sexy!!!"
4,Fun to watch,This movie is fun to watch and has great music. Interesting to see how all the stars of the movie have changed over the years. It has some harsh language and nude scenes. Some people may find it offensive. I enjoyed the scenes filmed around Chicago.
5,"This book is sweet! Lovely text, and awesome drawings!","This book is the sad story of Lou Gehrig, a true hero of New York. The up-beat drawings of the 1920's and 30's, really bring out the vibrant text."
2,This book left my son a sad feeling.,"After readind this book to my son, only once, I felt very sad about what happened. Maybe because my son is only 4, his reaction to this book was a lot of sadness, rather than liking the story, or learning about Baseball. I had to spend quite a bit of time explaining to him we (mom and dad) will not die and go to heaven just yet. He was so concerned we would not be around, and started asking so many questions about DEATH. My whole purpose of buying this book was to teach him about the sport, since he is getting so interested in it, and the experience was not even close to it. It is a good book to have and read about Lou Gehrig's history, but not for a 4 year old who just wants to understand and learn more about Baseball."
2,Not up to West Hornbook Quality,"I own all five first year West Hornbooks (Property, Contracts, etc.) and they all are a great help except for this one. It seems every time I have a question, this one doesn't have an answer. I love the other West Hornbooks, and after using the others, I just can't put this one in the same category for breadth, helpfulness or clarity."
1,Don't do it,"you are NOT going to read this along with your casebook. No way. Just get the E&E and the casebook, and go to class. you don't need this book unless it is assigned or you just enjoy learning from encyclopedic sources."
4,great test prep!,"This book is the perfect companion to the America at odds textbook. It offers sample multiple choice and essay questions and key terms for each chapter, along with the answers. It served as a vital resource for my Pol Sci 1 class, as my teacher followed the guide exactly, merely rewording the questions. Great also as overall review for finals."
1,disappointed,"I don't know if it was a production problem or shipping problem, but half of the box was discolored and cracked. It was clearly old or exposed to some sort of sustained heat. We had heard good things, but this was our first exposure to See's. My wife's excitement quickly turned to disappointment."
4,Great candy,"Chose this box because was all dark chocolate, but prefer to pick my own. It was really good but several pieces I simply didn't care for. Personal taste."
3,Too sweet,"I purchased this item after reading a Fortune magazine article about the company and how its product has less preservatives than other brands. Quality is fine, but the taste is too commercial and too sweet for a true dark chocolate lover."
2,KINDA INTERESTING,"Although it's suppossedly based on a true story, it's hard to believe the robbery occured the way it's portrayed. Security is non-existant. If you can suspend logic then it's an o.k. caper film. As a bonus you get to hear two versions of the titled song. One the classic and the other a disco version. There is also a cameo by John Rhys-Davies. This is above average DVD for the money but the image quality is pretty bad. The colors are dull and murky. The sound is just o.k. Geneon [Pioneer] ver."
4,"Sweet Food, Sweet fun, glorified","Not sure if she has anything to do with the weight or unhealthy eating habits, but she glorifies all that is unhealthy and fattening! However, a few times a week we will watch the movie since is good and the songs are usually pretty catchy. ""Eye Candy"" for all the kids, even my son watches! Just try having the kids eat broccolli after watching though.."
3,"Cute, but strange..........","My 3 1/2 year old daughter LOVES this new Strawberry video as the characters are ""all grown up!"" I, on the other hand, have noticed a few strange things about it. 1st, Tangerina Torta is no longer African American as she was in the World of Friends dvd. That is just CRAZY!!! We are white, but my daughter keeps asking me why Tangerina changed colors, and I have nothing I can tell her to expain that. Race is a hard enough issue to explain to little kids without tv characters changing races!! Also, the characters faces all look a little to similar for me (the toys have this same problem). The books seem to do the best job of making all the girls (and Huck) look unique. Other than these few things, the dvd itself is really cute and teaches good leasons."
3,Tangerina Torta?,"Tangerina Torta was not African - she is Latin American, from the Rainforest. I haven't seen this episode yet - just how light is her skin now, compared to the 'white' Strawberry kids??"
1,"do not order, bad product","We paid a good price for this product just alittle over two years ago...bad water pressure, never performed well. Now we might need to replace because the handle gears are stripped and we can't turn it Off! Do not buy this, one more call to the plumber!"
1,Sophomoric Writings,"I found the book to be a disappointment. The writing was tedious--no new ideas--just shock value ramblings. A more sophisticated approach would have illuminated contemporary social mores. The concepts presented are mundane and do not reflect authentic social criticism. The book has no intellectual value, no literary value and above all offers no actual social commentary."
3,"Good Book on football, Not Good for West Point.","If you like football and football stories, it is a good book to read. If you are looking for a good book on West Point and cadet life, it leaves much to be desired. Most of the story is on the football field. There is very little description of the life of a cadet and how they lived day to day. Also, the main charactor is little to self absorbed to be a good read. My recommendation would be to read Red Reeder's books - West Point Plebe, Yearling, Second Classma.n, and First Classman."
4,Entertaining & Often Humorous,"Sportswriter Jerome Holtzman (1926-2008) compiled this remarkable collection of baseball fiction by such notables as James Thurber, Ring Lardner, Bernard Malamud, etc. This entertaining book contains both short stories and excerpts from novels, and should be of interest for both baseball aficionados and fans of good fiction. I particularly liked ""Alibi Ike,"" about a ballplayer who mouthed excuses for every occurrence, and ""You Could Look It Up,"" a humorous piece by James Thurber about a pinch-hitting midget written years before Bill Veeck sent up midgit Eddie Gaedel in a real-life 1951 game in St. Louis. There are other humorous and interesting pieces here as well, most of which were written decades ago. Fans of baseball and of good fiction should enjoy this entertaining book.Note: Holtzman was the sports writer who came up with the Save as a baseball statistic."
5,An amazing reading experience,"Let me start off by saying that i'm a high school student and the only reason i picked this book was because there was a scholarship contest pertaining to it. I was incredibly suprised when i found myself totally enjoying the book. Although some parts of it are drawn out a little more than necessary, reading it was a totally worthwile experience. Once i started reading it, it was extremely hard to put down. Rand has a great style of writing which will make you feel as if you are part of the story. I highly recommend this book to all."
5,A Profound Life Experience,"This book frightened me at first because everyone I have ever known to read said they have had a life changing experience from reading it. I finally read it. The story wrapped me up in the beginning and carried me through till the end. And when I was done, I was a different person. Be fearful and in awe of works like this."
4,great characters and longwinded narration: a mixed bag,"Ayn Rand certainly writes some incredibley vivid, gigantic characters. Howard Roarke and Henry Reardon are 2 of her best creations. But lordy be, does this woman prattle on in places. The Fountainhead is more concise and will not bore you as much of some sections of Atlas Shrugged will. Warning: John Galt's 70 page speech in Atlas should be flipped thru as fast as humanly possible... Other than this, both books are a good challenge to anyone who likes to think for themselves, although her pro-industry stance is a little foolish to say the least..."
5,An exciting discovery for all Rand fans:,"If you enjoy Rand, I direct you to another ""Randlike"" novel,THE LAST DAY, by Glenn Kleier. In THE LAST DAY, Kleier tackles the subject of authority in organized religion with startling ""Ayn Rand"" objectivism and outrageous wit and irreverence. LAST DAY is a classic, watershed novel in the manner of FOUNTAINHEAD and SHRUGGED. I found it a riveting read, and one that I greatly encourage all Rand fans to experience."
3,Two Ridiculous Books in One,"The hero of The Fountainhead does his best to make himself the apple of the reader's eye by raping the leading lady. In the climactic scene, he consistently demonstrates his love of violence by dynamiting a building. Naturally, he gets away with everything.Atlas Shrugged is much better, although the characters and the story are unbelievable."
4,"We must read our enemies' works, too, comrades :)","Ayn Rand's politics are extremist, to say the least.I do not agree with most of her ideas, but she definitelyput a dent in my opinions. Her extremism has uncovered forme a new perspective of looking at social order.However, her writing is repetitive and monotonous. ""AtlasShrugged"" would only benefit from having some chaptersamputated.I.T."
5,"The most influential book you'll ever read, if you think.","If you read only one book in your life, read TheFountainhead by Ayn Rand. It will make you think long andhard about the nature of man's relationship to ""society,""whatever that is."
4,Some of the most talented music ever written.,"My only problem with this album is that its so short. The vocalizations are superb, the guitar work is amazing, and nothing can top the drumming. This is a CD that is dripping with emo, and, friend, that's a good thing!"
5,Love Sephirot in toy!,"I really like Sephirot's character from the saga of FINAL FANTASY, and when I saw this figure I was surprised at how nice it is and at the price it has!Usually, this kind of collectibles are more expensive than this one is, so I didn't think twice before buying him and adding him to our collection of figures!!!"
5,Very true to the Advent Children rendition,"Although I can't agree with other writers here about ""loving Seph"", etc. (It's a toy, people!) I must admit this is a very nice piece of work...Looking very much like the Sephiroth of the Advent Children movie. The posable arms can be set to mimic many of the poses from Advent Children, and maybe even FF7. His features are dead-on. Hinting at the evil within.This character is depicted in the game/movie at the Nightmare. Heaven's Dark Harbinger. But, if you are a collector or a fan, it might turn out to be your dream."
5,I love my Sephi!!,"This action figure is sitting on my desk at home. He's my little computer buddy. It's really not bad at all, although the plastic hair doesn't allow his head to move very much. When I'm writing, and I get to a point where I need to back off a bit, I pick him up and change the pose, or threaten my daughter with the masamune, or she and I set him up for a couple of humourous pics. It's great.All hail Sephi!! (and you can just hear it, Why the heck are you calling me that? Well, why not? It's weird and it's not right! But, Sephi....)Hahahaha. Can't wait to get Cloud too. Then things in my house will be interesting."
5,Excellent Action Figure,This action figure looks just like the Sephiroth from the Advent Children movie. It comes with interchangeable hands and can be posed many ways with the adjustable arms. The sword is very long just as Sephiroth's sword should be and his hair is very long just like that should be. It also comes with a nice stand. This is an excellent action figure I believe you will really enjoy.
2,Translation,I have a copy of original Muye dobo tongji written in classic Chinese and found some distorted translation in this book.
3,Interesting,"Interesting for history porpuses. It is clear that this book is a translation from a Chinese book on the arts of combat. Found interesting the way they approched the only empty hand art in the book, Kwon Bop (Chuan Fa in chinese, Kempo in japanese, meaning ""The law of the fist""), stating that has little use in the battlefield, but is the only way to built up the spirit for battle. The small use in the battlefield is understandable, due to the fact that weapons are obviusly used. I liked the sprit building aspect mentioned, i feel that is the ultimate martial arts goal, to train on one system to a point that your self confidence overcomes your internal fears, helping you to see in your core what is your true self, to become an overall better person."
5,Great old Hymns done well,"I love this CD. It has just a little bit too much Appalachian influence to really be ""Old English"" but still very enjoyable. It is not overtly Appalachian. I am very glad I own it."
3,Not My CD,"Hello... I'm sure this is a good record, but I only played on it... it is NOT my CD. - John Mock"
2,Good start but looses itself midway through,"I listened to this book on tape and although I enjoyed the beginning and was looking forward to a good story I found myself dissappointed and a bit disinterested by the end. There is no question that Lyden lived overcame a traumatic childhood and it is interesting to read about it. But her conclusions seemed, well, inconclusive. In the end she waxes poetic but doesn't really make any clear point. She accepts her mother and misses her mothers manias and she repeats how content she is with her own life. It seemed more like she really didn't know how to synthesize her story and that she was trying to convince herself and the readers that she was ""at peace"" then it actually seemed true. At the end of the book Lyden still didn't seem to have the solid foundation which, sadly, her childhood failed to provide."
2,Self-Help Book Striving to Be Memoir,"Jacki Lyden has attempted to capture what it was like to live with and endure the trials of a dysfunctional mother. While the situations evoke sympathy and empathy, they also bring forth pathos, similar to that caused by the Duke of Deception by Geoffrey Wolff. What parents the Duke and the Queen of Sheba make. This is a self-help book striving, apparently, to be memoir. The writing, while at times successful, is repetitive and irksome. How much complaining is a reader supposed to abide?"
4,A wonderful book...,"This is a wonderful book which is one woman's story about a relationship with her mother which was shaped by her mother's mental illness. Her writing rings of honesty of emotion regardless of whether the events are factually accurate. Her ability to express her appreciation of her mother as a women, healthy or ill, is a touching reminder of the bond between ourselves and our parents."
3,Too Choppy,"This book was written by someone from my hometown, thus I know the characters. She changed the names and the places, yet I still knew what she was referring to. She left out any reference to her two younger brothers so were my age. This book was written in a very choppy fashion...hard to tell her current experiences from her past experiences in her writing."
4,"great message, hokey dialogue","There are many sound success principles in this book. Build trust, accentuate the positive, redirect the energy when mistakes occur. Praise progress, catch people doing things right. There is meat to be found in this book, if you can dig it out of its somewhat sappy coating.Through the fictional story of Wes Kingsley, Whale Done! identifies proven principles that motivate killer whales at Sea World, and illustrates how they may be applied to benefit your relationships at work and home. Prepare to learn some sound information that will help you and your team become more effective, but brace yourself for dialogue that reads like a cheap infomercial.Larry Hehn, Author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory"
5,Whaley Good!,"Another good and easy to read book by Ken Blanchard! I read it in one day and could have read it in one sitting. A trainer at work gave me the book to read and it was well worth it. No new information in this book, but the way Blanchard tells his stories always makes it seem like it is new and it really sticks because of the great story. Great idea of using Sea World as the back drop to tell the story about giving positive feedback. This book was a great reminder and refresher for me. Recently, I have been doing a lot of ""Gotchas"" with my employees and now I'm going to start telling them ""WHALE DONE!"". Thanks, Ken!"
4,Excellent Book,great positive book on how to build and encourage great relationships. A must read for everyone.
4,Amazing - it works when you follow it.,"You have to ask yourself this question: ""How can whale trainers get a 1500 lb whale to do what they want when I can't get a 150 lb male to do what I want?"" It's all about how you say what you say. Words have such a deep effect on us and this book proves that. I've had mothers tell me that by using the methods in this book they can get their teenagers (especially male teenagers) to get things done. I have discovered it only works when you use it. If you slip up, you have to start all over (redirect). It's just as hard on the person giving instructions because you have to take the time to think about how you are going to get the results you want."
5,Great book!,"I purchased this book as a reading for my management class in college and I love it! Although the story is fictional, the idea behind it is real. Perfect book for someone starting their own business or someone who is having a hard time running one!"
1,More of the same fromThe One Minute Manager,If you read the one minute manager do not waste your time or money on the same old stuff. Maybe Dr Blanchard will get a new idea some day! ALthough he is a master at getting lots of $ for the same old stuff.
2,Five Stars for Chapter 2,"Easy read, but got all I needed from chapter two. (I did read the whole book.) All these books are overpriced, so if your interested go to your library and check it out. If your short on time, just read chapter 2.However with that said, the information is solid and helpful."
2,Whales 'OVER' done!,"First off, the book is OK and stresses being positive and looking for those positives in your daily life. Great! I am a believer and the book reminded me that we should work a little harder to practice the positive at home, work, and in almost everything that we do.With that said - so what? Most people instinctively know this stuff but cannot find a practical use for it in such a simplistic manner. After all what am I supposed to say when an unthinking employee, just contstantly forgets a task that I have assigned? ""Whale Done Joe! - you have blown off that same task for the 4th day in the row now - I AM REALLY IMPRESSED THAT YOU STILL WORK HERE????"" Give me a break. Blanchard would never have got this book in print if it were not for his earlier book successes. Spend an hour in the corner of the library and consume this thing if you must, but remember to only think 'good thoughts' even if you feel your time could have been better spent reading the Sunday comics."
2,Simplistic book that should be no more than an article,"Written as a fictional story with unnatural dialogue, very simplistic message, does not even scratch the surface of human motivation. Nothing new here, this would not even be noticed as an article by a popular magazine. A typical example of low content book that is no more than a streched and pumped-up 4-page article. Nuff said. Leave on the shelves."
5,"Whale Done equals 11,000 lbs of leadership","Ken Blanchard does it again. He provides a fresh look at a tried and true idea. After years of management training and motivational classes, the importance of looking for the good gets tarnished. The idea of catching people doing things right instead of constantly looking for the negative works. The way Ken presents the parallel of killer whales and people is brilliant. During the book I couldn't help but think, these trainers from Sea World can't talk killer whale language, but yet discovered an effective way to get positive results. How is it that I have known my kids since birth, but can't seem to get them listen to one word I say sometimes.If these guys are willing to get into a tank with an 11,000 lb whale using Blanchards techniques, maybe I can get my son to keep his room clean and have fun doing it."
5,Cool story,I love how this book uses the story of killer whales to make its point. It is so easily to relate to very reasonable when it comes to applying the same principles in my life.l
1,Did Not Make A Big Splash With Me,"As a manager for many years, I got nothing out of this book. I don't see how workers are like whales. It just doesn't make sense!!"
1,A Rather Silly Idea,"Here we have a book about an old idea: positive reinforcement. In other words, reward people when they do good as the whale trainer does when he gives the whale a fish for jumping through a hoop. I wish life was this simple and managing people this easy, but dealing with complex relationships is far harder than giving simple rewards. The basic premise of this book is that people are like whales.To assert that managers can command people to do what they want by simple rewards is silly, naive and just downright dumb! No company that I know works this way. There is office politics to consider, personalities to contemplete and power players to acknowledge. This is what it is like to work in an office, which is much more complex than the simple reward system that Blanchard advocates. People are more complex than whales and while this book may be a whale of an idea it is not a book that carries much weight."
1,One Side Of The Story,"After I read this book, I watched the Discovery Channel's program about killer whales. They showed the whales swimming in packs and how they combined their efforts to kill a baby blue whale. This is the kind of behavior that Blanchard does not address in his book Whale Done. He has a simplistic view of whales and people. He thinks of only domesticated, well-trained whales that appear in shows for entertainment. Here he misses the mark completely!! He thinks that by being good to whales you will bring out the best in them and he applies the same sort of unreliable logic to people. I suppose giving the killer whales that were about to kill the baby whale a small treat would have spared the baby's life. Nonsense!!This book is flawed, simple and out of touch with reality."
5,a good self-help book,"If you want to read more self-help books but you're tired of the same old put-on-a-happy-face drivel, this may be the book for you. The main theme of the book is this: keep a list of names, addresses, and phone numbers of people you meet and stay in touch with them. Moreover, do occasional favors for them because you might someday need favors FROM them.The book is interesting. It is liberally dosed with anecdotes and second-person pronouns--two factors which help greatly in making a book interesting.However, I'm ashamed that I haven't put the book into better practice. In response to the book, I made an e-mail mailing list of people whom I know and sent them an annual newsletter--except that I skipped last year because I didn't have anything to say.I hope you read this book, and I hope you put it into practice better than I have."
3,Why is this book different from all other self-help books?,"Why do self-help books concentrate on developing personality and friendships without stressing the need to be a person of substance rather than the process of ""personality?"" Anyone can be taught the art of schmoozing, cajoling, jawboning and joke telling. How many have the commitment to stand for something, often unpopular, in order to gain respect and grow one's business or profession ?"
4,Networking is simply too important to be ignored!,"Networking is just so important both in your business and social life, and it is highlighted time and again in the book. Being well 'Networked' may give you access to priviledged information in important situations, and might be the key to saving you from a crisis situation. This book describes all aspect of networking, and most importantly, explains how to apply it with some examples. I highly recommend this book."
2,A Yarn,"I've read and own several books by Harvey Mackay. I personally think he is a good writer and extremely streetsmart, though I am not so sure if he'd survive in Asia. BUT this book, is not one of his best. This is more an autobiography of Mackay's networking than the art of networking itself. No big deal."
5,My Networking Bible,"This is the first book I ever read on networking and if I never read another one, I'll be successful for years to come. Harvey really opens up your eyes to what is possible when you do your best to get to know others and extend them a hand. What's more, Harvey writes in short sections that makes it easy for those of us who don't have a lot of time to read."
3,"Good introduction, but not the only networking book ever","Harvey Mackay tells us really a lot about networking and his interesting life. To find out, what networking can be used for, why it's important - very important, and what mistakes can be made, this book is a good introduction. But there are too many short stories in this book, till the end, there's no ultimate lesson to be taken from the book. On the last few pages this gets better, though, however: in my opinion it's not the only networking book you will ever need."
1,NOT worth the time to read,"This book has way too many useless stories about his life and friends without any real substance about how to build a network. Even worse were the stories about how networking is important. I know it's important or I wouldn't have bought the book. It does seem a bit dated at times, but is mostly relevant if you get by the other stuff. I feel like this book is the product of an author who has had successes in the past and wanted to write another book to make more money and brag about how good he is."
5,An opportunity to expand your network,"Couldn't put the book down. Filled with golden nuggets . You want to expand your network ? This is the book for you. Harvey Mackay is absolutely right when he said "" The best way you can help yourself is to use your network to help others."" Read his book today."
4,A perfectionism for networking,"The book begins by asking: If you encounter a serious problem how many people can you rely on that will certainly give a hand.As most people have 2-3 real trusted friend, the author response is that he has 50.This book is about making relationship with people.As this is the second book on the term I have finished reading, it does repeat many of Keith Ferrazzi ""Never eat alone"" book (which was written afterwards).The stories and advice this book gives are worth reading."
4,Good Read,"The idea is networking, job searches, and being able to advance yourself or land a job in case of being laid off is far easier when prepared in advance. This is excellent advice and this book gives pointers in how to prepare before you are forced to change."
3,One-fourth of an interesting book,"Timothy Garton Ash should have stuck with Prague. While he may have witnessed the fall of Communism in four countries, he only had the ""inside story"" in Czechoslovakia. His reports on Poland, Budapest and East Germany seem rather superficial. I read this book in its 1999 British edition, titled ""We the People."" Perhaps this 1993 edition is slightly different, but the one I read was full of metaphors and references I didn't get. If you're interested in this underresearched period of history, I'd recommend reading this book -- at your library. I don't know if it's worth a purchase."
3,Too bad Ash was Not really in Prague...,"Ash was not in Prague until ten days after the revolution started on November 17th 1989 with the 'student massacre.' He really missed the most exciting days of the revolution on the streets. However, he has always been a good name-dropper and in touch with dissendent leaders in Prague despite what they may say about him. This book gives the reader access to some of their (the dissidents) thoughts during the 1990s which are often forgotten today. His section on Prague is fairly good but the other ""revolutions"" were superficial in coverage. Unlike other books by Ash, this one seems to be a quick and hasty preparation to strike while the fire of revolution was hot in the media spotlight. It is worth reading to learn a perspective on the people of 1989 in Central Europe."
5,Great Help for Husbands & Dads,"This book is amazing! Not only is it helpful, insightful, and informative but it is incredibly entertaining to read as well. From helping to motivate my family to get involved in household chores to practical ideas to organize my garage (always the dad's area of responsibility!)all the way to accommodating overnight guests - this book is the best how-to field guide for running a house that I have ever read. A real must for all members of the family but especially practical for husbands and dads."
4,Good Advice,"Excellent Book! A lot of great ideas to get the house in order. One of the things I especially like are her suggestions for including kids of all ages in practical matters around the house. Get your two year old to clean?! She offers many idea on how to do it. From that angle, her ideas are rather ""Montessoriesque"", giving kids a challenge and a sense of accomplishment when their task is acheived.I do agree, however, that some of her idea will not work with every house and family. (She really does like those disinfectant clothes. Not very economical.) But, if you take what you need and adapt if for your own needs, this book offers much."
2,"Come on! Erm, where we goin'?","Could have been a killer album if it the tempo's hadn't been so rushed, and the vocals so overheated. And the recurring use of the phrase ""Come on!"", is really annoying. Very flawed."
4,Wonderful Debut,"At times lyrical, this first novel of Lewis DeSoto begins with a great deal of potential. Here are two women who have lost--parents, husband. Here are two women in apartheid South Africa, one black and one white. DeSoto describes grief poignantly without being over the top, but he fails on two points: his dialogue is wooden and he often isn't as subtle as he could be, pointing out his lyricism to the reader too blatantly.DeSoto has a solid start though--he will learn to develop characters through dialogue and create believable conversations. He will draw in the scenery without making obvious metaphors. After all, if he can create sorrow in such a fashion, he can create life.A bit lengthy, this novel is still completely readable and worth the read. The chapters are short and despite my frustrations, I did have a hard time putting it down. There is an investment from the reader into these pages and I know DeSoto is a valuable author."
2,Had a hard time finishing it,"This book moved slowly, and didn't keep me interested very well. The symbology was not very subtle, the author just laid it out in front of you, not letting you search for it at all. I thought the second half was better than the first."
3,Neither here nor there,"Though I found this book hard to put down, I felt it was lacking. It was not fast moving, yet it wasn't meant to be. The main character, Marit, did not change or grow much, and as the end of the book drew near I felt her fate was inevitable, yet I was unsure of the lesson to be learned from it. At the end I no longer felt anything for her. The dialogue could use some work, and the symbology of the land with life was a little too obvious; it was almost cheesy. Regardless, the novel held me because it had a layer of hope hidden under the surface. It reminded me of how helpless we really are and that sometimes hard work and dedication mean nothing in a world torn by war and injustice. I felt that the author captured these feelings very well."
2,Depressing read,"Not only was the story depressing the main character was pathetic and stupid. I know that sounds harsh, but while I want to applaud her for trying to run her farm after her husband's death and for seeing past the color of a person's skin, given the times and circumstances, staying was a death wish.I'm sure many others liked or even loved this book. However, I'm just not one of them. Not only did the main character not set well with me, the writing did not engage me in the story (jarring switches in the point of view and long, overly detailed descriptions)."
5,One sweet reel,"There are lots of fly fishing reels out there to choose from/ Some are cheap and basic, others high priced and smooth. The EastFork reel bridges these two extremes. It's reasonably priced--though not cheap, by any means--and it's incredibly smooth. Plus it's beautifully machined and designed. I can't wait to load my spare reel up with steelhead line and head for the river this fall."
2,okay but not great,"The sad thing is this could have been a great graphic novel if the stories just weren't so short ... the one about the waitress who wants to be a famous actress was good but the others ..... basically this is way too many short stories that have the POTENTIAL to be good if they were only explored in more detail. The stories are too short and end too quickly - a bit like getting a bite of a good meal then having the rest of it suddenly whisked away from you .. as far as the ""average day in the life of a superhero/superheroine"" type comics/graphic novel feel that this book strives to accomplish, the ""astro city"" books do a far better job of this sort of thing, which I would strongly recommend to any readers interested in that kind of story... to be honest I'm really surprised this graphic novel received all the hype that it did from various famous persons in the comics industry."
2,"Poor PDA, Batteries drain fast.",For a palm-Pilot they could have done a better job. it is not worth the price i paid. The batteries drain fast even with the unit off.
1,Cheap Cheap!,We have a ton of little Polly Pocket pieces and didn't want them getting lost so thought the Cruisin Closet Carrycase would be perfect. This item is made extremely CHEAP! The seller makes it sound like it has lots of compartments do store things but they are so small and open weird that not alot can fit in. The front two boards are made out of cardboard and plastic and this whole thing is not durable what so ever. Every time we move one of the parts we're scared it will break! Not worth the money. Polly Pocket needs to develop a much better case that holds the dolls as well!
1,I wish I read these reviews first....,My daughter loves Polly pockets so I thought this carrying case would be great for all of the small pieces. I wish I read these reviews first because I would have saved myself the money. Nothing works on this case! The drawers fall out and pieces fall behind the drawers. It's useless... I store all the pieces in a plastic zipper bag and that does the job a lot better.
1,The most tererible organizer ever,"My daughter received this for her 7th birthday. The fronts are cheap, and so it the plastic. Since then she has put all of her polly things in plastic baggies. It is pretty sad how cheaply and disoragnized this toy was built, and I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,disappointed,"I bougth thus storage case so my 4 yr old daughter could put her polly clothes somewhere out of the way. I don't like it because the small items like shoes etc.. get stuck behind the pull out bins . When something gets caught my daughter has to ask me to get it out, which is hard because of the material the shoes are made out of. I wouldn't recommend this storage case to anyone I ended up buyinga plastic pencil case for her pollys and it's better. It's also a pitchintg hazard becaue it's hard to get fingers behind the bins to get anything out."
1,Really wanted this to work!,"Once my daughter grew an interest in Polly Pockets we somehow started to accumulate tons of miniature little shoes, clothes, pocketbooks - if your child has Polly Pockets you know exactly what I mean. I spotted this case at a local consignment store with a $5 tag on it. It seemed like an answer to our Polly Pocket storage issues. I have no idea what this really retails for in the stores. Paying $5 was too much! The drawers are not easy to pull out and you can only put one or two items in each drawer otherwise things get trapped behind the drawers. Don't let this thing fall on its side because everything flies out. Why is there a handle on this thing? You really cannot take this thing anywhere. Congratulations to those who find this product worthy of 4 or 5 stars. This isn't working for us. One star!"
4,Polly Pocket Carrycase,"This is a great accessory for storing all those little Polly Pocket pieces. The only thing I didn't care for was the front panels, which are cardboard, come out quite easily. Also the larger drawers can only hold one or two polly dolls. Polly needs more closet space at our house."
1,Parent,"I was very disappointed in this product. The draws for the container are not completely solid, so the little pieces fall behind. They are difficult to get out. I would not recommend this case, there are better ones out their."
3,not that bad,"I bought one for my daughter. But, it also came with 2 Polly Pocket - Adorable Storable - Small Storages (those round basket kind). So I got one price for 3 items!! You need to be sure the item you are purchasing comes with 2 extra small storages with it. I'll have to say, the carrying case is not as durable as I would like it to be. And the Doll doesn't fit in. But it is good enough for my daughter to enjoy and store her Polly Pocket items."
3,Good enough try but the elves are badly portraited,"The problem when reading about Elminster is that you know that he will overcome any foe presented against him.He is just too powerful. Elminster is as usually protected by Mystra and thereby impossile to kill. Another thing that annoyed me is that the elves felt like humans.The elves where not the elegant race shrouded in mystery as in the works of Tolkien(unfair comparison). I think a book about elves should be written by Salvatore, after all he did a magnificent job describing the drow and their lifestyle. The part where El was an apprentice puzzled me.Why on earth would an archmage capable of hurling meteor storms serve another mage? Also sometimes I felt like Elminster was a force of evil rather than good slaying elves almost at will."
5,Ed Greenwood has done it again.,"I give this book 5 stars, well possibly 4 and a half for it started to lag near the end when El was wandering aroung as a phantom. This novel gave a good look into Elminster's past during his first mission as one of Mystra's Chosen and the persecution that he faced by the xenophobic elves during his time in Cormanthyr. After reading this novel I'm only left with one question. Who is the Mentor, and why was he so readily accepted by the elves?"
5,Another Homerun,"This stop in the Elfminster series was another positive experience for me. The insight into the inner workings of the elven community was fascinating. I loved the fact that they were portrayed as ""human like"" with regard to their ambitions, flaws, and political manipulations. However, just like us, there are always those who seek to rise above and become a better version of themselves. There is plenty of magic, intrigue, and pathos to keep the reader coming back. Some may not like the fact that the setting is basically limited to the elven city, but for me it allowed the author to bring more depth to the story instead of running around questing for this and that. I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series."
3,Good but I was expecting more,"I'd have to say I was disapointed while reading this book. Too much of the story line relies on magic and things ""just happening"" apparently due to Mystra's intervention. I realize this is a series of books on how Elminster becomes the great mage that he evolves into, but this book just didn't do much to show how that happens.The story takes place in the elven city of Cormanthor where the leader has decided take steps to open up the city to non-elves. This is a radical plan which infuriates certain factions in the city. Into this political turmoil steps our ever innocent, naive mage Elminster. While this might be a great way to address racism in our current society that's best left for another book. What was needed here, and still could have been done but wasn't, was more development of Elminster's abilities and maturity. He seemed to be the same character at the end of the book that he was at the end."
1,Dry and boring as usual from Greenwood.,"The whole Elminster series is very disappointing. This series was my first taste of Greenwoods writing and since it came out in hardback, I assumed it would be a good read. Shame on me for judging a book by its cover. Everything else I have read under the D&D; umbrella by the varying authors has been a good read has ranged from good to fantastic.These Eliminster books do not flow and lack depth. I had to struggle through them and then sold them on eBay. These are the only D&D; books I have read and sold. I am sure Greenwood is a good guy but not a good author.If the Eliminster books are your first taste of the D&D; realms, try some other authors as well. Any of them will be better than this. This is most defiantly NOT the best and brightest star in the D&D; realm of books."
3,better than Making of a Mage,"This was the best Ed Greenwood book I've read so far, although thats not saying much. It was much better than Making of a Mage (the worst book I've ever read) and much better than Corymr: A Novel (the second worst book I've ever read). Compared to the other Forgotten Realms books this was below average.Greenwood books are so predictable. Elminster always calls on Mystra to save the day; can't he do anything by himself? And the women always end up naked.And damn it, Ed, we all know Elminster is just a fantasy version of you which is why he's invincible and beautiful women fall in love with him even though he's ugly.If there's ever a book where Elminster permanently dies, I'll be the first in line to buy it. If Ed's latest book was titled ""Elminster Goes to Hell"" I'd buy that one too."
4,Elminster in Myth Drannor,I really thought this book was a great sequal in the Elminster saga.For all the people out there that havent read this book buy it and read it.But first buy and read the first book Elminster the making of a mage.
2,Not worth it,"With names like Aulauthar Orbryn and Eltargrim Irithyl, and about 40 other names and nicknames for a host of key characters..this book is way to hard to keep up with. The story was below average, and even the epic battles couldn't save it's let down of an ending. Ed's written better stuff."
4,Confusing?!??! But a good book,"After reading Elminster The Making of a Mage, I was ready to jump into this book. This is a good book never less. But the bickering between the elves was very confusing. I got lost in many of the spell battles in the book. But at the end I understood what was happening and was glad that I finished it."
4,"Good book, but not as good as ""making of a mage""","This was a good book, but it left something to be desired. It wasn't as good as ""Making of a Mage"" in my oppinion but still a book worth reading."
1,Good books have good characters...this doesn't,"I found myself really wanting to love this book and walked away quite disappointed. First, it wanders all over the place. Second, the character developer is just poor. I would have assumed that Elminster was the main character that the author wanted the reader to like but he really came out as a lackey who tripped into situations and needed his butt to be saved by others, consistently. Lastly, while the author strove to use dialogue that reflected the ""era"", he slipped several times using modern colloquialisms that stuck out badly.For me, this was oka writing, okay dialogue, poor character development and just an okay story. I felt empty when it ended like nothing was resolved."
5,If You Ever Doubted Why We Should Be On The Moon.....,"What an exciting and educational collection of essays. Some of the essays are from famous space writers such as Andrew Chaiken and Robert Zimmerman. They even included Alan Steele who is one of my all time favorite science fiction writers. This book makes you think about many of the issues we will have to consider if we are to settle the moon. Some of these subjects include how to get back there, lunar manufacturing, spiritual aspects, as well as what it will mean to mankind. One of my favorite essays was on the ""Overview Effect"" by Frank White, which tells how the perspective of mankind can forever be changed. I thought this book was a fascinating read and well worth the money."
4,Good enough as a gift,"The Tachikoma PVC key chain is tough, flexable, and fun to have around. I work in a mill and my keys get exposed to all sorts of chemicals, but my Tochikoma keeps kick'n with no damage. Some Of my coworkers liked it so much they got them too."
3,Nice collection; not destined to be a favorite.,"This book falls short of my favorite Marie Barber book: Gifts of Nature: An American Sampler. The qualities that I liked most about that book are missing from this one. There, Marie had large samplers that were photographed in finished form as well as including ideas of how to pull out portions of the designs for smaller projects. This book is loaded with small patterns but few are shown combined or photographed finished. I would like some suggestions on how to use these patterns individually or combined. I also miss the size charts that tell me how big the finished design will be based on thread count of fabric used; call me lazy.I have worked a few of these designs, and they are easy to follow as are all of Marie's patterns. So I would say that this is nice book for someone who is looking for a collection of small, simple floral patterns."
3,Nothing unusual,"This book contains patterns that are typical of any other pattern book. The patterns are not great nor are they spectacular. Rather, they are what I would consider basics. If you are looking for unusual patterns or motifs, you will not find them in this book. Most projects are simple enough for beginners but experts may not be challenged."
2,less than expected,"The book had some good tips, but I feel like there was a lot of advice that I was looking for that I didn't get--like pros and cons of selling by owner vs. with an agent and searching on your own vs. getting a buyer agent--just as an example. If I had been able to preview it before I bought it, I wouldn't have bought it."
2,Not one of Dave's best,"I am a big fan of Dave's Gourmet sauces and condiments, but not this one. If I was just rating it as a mustard alone I would give it 3 stars for taste, 1 for value. There are much better, brighter and fresher tasting mustards available at half the cost of this one.However, this is a Dave's Gourmet product and as such I am looking for not just a good mustard but but one that makes a good use of a variety of heat producing, tongue scorching peppers, like Serrano or maybe even Habanero. What we get instead is a mediocre Dijon-style mustard spiced up with ""hot pepper extract"". This is a commercial additive of pure (or close to pure) capsicum, which is used for riot control and to add heat to an otherwise bland product. In my humble opinion hot pepper extract adds ""hotness"" without adding to the flavor. Dave's has some great products, I just don't think that this is one of them."
3,Overly Sentimental,"I am a big fan of Midsomer Murders and am glad to have watched this one since I want to see them all. However, this one is overly sentimental with an excess of adoration for a dead songwriter/composer. Those who adored her are still wrecked over her untimely death. The direction and production of this episode make me want to avoid any other episodes they directed and produced.If you are like me and a rabid fan, you should watch this episode but it's not the best one."
