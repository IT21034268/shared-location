2,Disappointment,"I was counting on a THREE HOUR working battery. After all, that's what it says it gives you. So far all I get from it, after more than a month of use, is two hour, max..."
3,"Is 3 hours, or really two hours","This battery is advertised as a THREE hour battery. However, after I received the battery and gave it a full charge in-accordance-with the instruction my camera shows it as having a two hour life. It's difficult to tell how long it's lasting because my videotaping is done in short clips at a time. I'm going to buy one more battery, but this time I'll spend a little more and buy a name brand battery. There is truth in the saying you get what you pay for, lower cost equals less time. If I get around to timing the battery life with a stop watch I'll update my review."
5,Great stuff for good price...,"I purchased this battery as a back-up to the one that came with the camcorder. The great thing about this is, once charged, it can sit in a camcorder for a month without loosing any power. I discovered this last week when I wanted to use the camcorder and was worried that the battery may be dead by now but ...surprise surprise. Its recharge time is very fast.The only negative part (if I must have to give) is, it's a little bigger then the one that comes with camcorder.I say go for it."
5,Eficaz,"""Simplemente indispensable para poder aprovechar el disco duro de la cámara, de otro modo está de más tanto espacio"""
4,DID KIDD VISIT MY WARD TO WRITE THIS BOOK?,"This is such a great novel about the inner workings of a LDS ward that I thought she must be talking about my own ward. I read this book for an assignment in college and have read it several times since. Easy to read, funny, and yet Kidd brings home a great insight into Mormon culture, that, only until recently, has been shaded and guarded. Kidd is a great LDS author."
4,Great camera for smaller budget,"Takes good quality pictures comparable to more expensive models. Has 2x digital zoom (as a selectable menu option), not to be confused with optical zoom which is much better. If you need real zoom choose another model. Uses Compact Flash cards which are very popular and thus less expensive than other types. I recommend canon cameras, they are more professional."
3,Too much prologue,"When the action happens, it works, but too much of the book is review of the characters and updates on their personal lives."
5,"""Bannerman's Ghost""","I have been waiting for this new addition to the ""Bannerman"" series and was not disappointed. I could not put this one down till I had read it cover to cover. Being a patrol officer, I appreciate the realistic avenues this book travels and the sense of humor which matches those of us in law enforcement. I was on the edge of my seat."
4,well balanced,"At the suggestion of a friend from Kerala, India,I purchased this movie. Watching with a friend, we found it historically well placed and apparently well balanced. My only regret is there were no scenes from Mother Teresa's funeral, which was a State funeral,with a procession beginning at the School of the Sisters of Loretto, and ending at the Missionaries of Charity Mother House."
5,Excellent Movie,This movie about MT is the best version out there and it is very well done. I got mine here for very low price and it was brand new still in the wrapper and I watch it in HDTV with an up-convert HD-DVD player but the DVD is not HD. But that is no complaint as this is the best version of Mother Teresa's story starting as a Nun and working alone in the slums and slowly growing into the Mother and getting the Peace Prize. This is the kind of movie that inspires those that watch it.
1,Misleading Title .. and still some points lacking...,This book is more about collection development than it is about fashion drawing. And the worst part is... it's so sparse on the information even for how to develop a collection. Everything is in a nutshell. It's like picking up a children's book-- you don't get much out of it other than the obvious.
3,Fair,I bought this book acually wanting to draw and create clothes but I didn't do any of that. On the other hand it does teach you the right way to do certain things like how to get inspiration and how to get it on paper but again you don't actually draw.
3,very basic,"Very basic, it goes on a summary overview of areas of fashion design. So, it's great for a beginner that is looking for a quick introduction to what fashion desing drawing would include. Not for someone that has a general idea on what fashion design entails and is looking for more ""hands-on"" more sophisticated projects. For example, I was looking on how to actually draw clothes wore by people...there was only one area for that, it covered actual drawing of the human body; about 4 pages. A lot of general, finding your style, mood boards, etc. To the title I would add ""101"" so it is not misleading, then it would be an excellent book!"
5,Expec...,"Well this book its awesome, really works about yor creativity and explore many ways to become a Designer...."
1,Possibly the most mis-leading title ever,"This book is awful, especially given it's title. Drawing is not discussed in the book in any meaningful way. the cover is dreadfully misrepresentative of what is inside. The drawing styles presented are horribly dated from a horrible fashion Illustration era. These 80's - 90's looks are awful to look at and disproportioned.Very little if anything can be learned from this book."
3,Alot of information,"This book gives much fuel for imagination-lots of color, painting, prints, artwork- less practical information such as flat drawing, measuring, etc for actual production. The 4 pages devoted to ""working drawings"" were too brief and examples to small to read."
2,meh,"I am very intreguied about the lessons in this book. it was an interesting way to look at fashion design. however, i was disappointed in the lack of instruction of drawing fashion figures. Also, the drawings in this book were very dated, so the drawings were very irrelevent"
5,Making the invisible visible,"This is the most important book yet written about same-sex desire and the institution of education in the US. Blount describes in rich detail how schools have attempted to control the sexuality of their workers--and how school workers have resisted. The research for the book is impressive: Blount traveled widely throughout the US to access archives and other original sources. The book is sure to stimulate a wide range of emotions in readers: outrage at oppression, satisfaction at successful resistance, sadness that justice continues to be withheld in too many school districts. The book is highly readable, beautifully written, and compelling. Anyone interested in the history of sexuality, education, and/or gender will find this book to be absorbing. I recommend it highly."
4,Good book for a beginner to understanding the car,"I did a lot of research before deciding to buy my car, so the book was more of a casual read. The book provides a good overview of the Mini, including history which is interesting. As for performance information, it focuses mostly on shops/parts available in the UK and not the US. I'm glad I read it and will add it to my book collection on cars I've owned."
3,"Buying and Modifying, but very little on maintaining","After buying a used 2004 Mini and being a do-it yourselfer I thought this book would have more on maintaining the Mini. It really doesn't give much more than the owners manual. I was hoping for more trouble shooting, but then Bentley's Service manual doesn't either."
2,"Not bad, but not comprehensive on modification portion.","Not a bad book I have to say. For people who like to research before buying a mini, this is a great book. For someone, like myself, who owns one and like to modify it more, it is just a disappointment."
5,Incredible package and bargain!,"It's pretty amazing to see such a beautiful and comprehensive package like this for a band that never enjoyed a ton of success. Thank you Metal Blade for the effort that went into this - this set is well worth checking out for any fan of old school 80's metal - I guarantee it will be like discovering buried treasure. Hallows Eve could thrash with the best of 'em but what really amazes is how memorable so many of these songs are after all these years - there are endless catchy choruses and musical hooks and hearing them again after 15+ years is a joy.The live DVD is all bootlegs and of lower quality, but it really gives the vibe of those early years and how hungry hard working bands like Hallows Eve were back in the glory days of a very exciting scene. 4 for the music, 5 for the package.Would LOVE to see a Nasty Savage package like this from Metal Blade!"
3,Use as ballast only,"I second Isiah's opinion that the book is not very useful and is best read as a pre-trip planning material only. I have actually undertaken a few of the treks and in my opinion the book misrepresents the nature of several treks and contains errors in the route descriptions. For example, Isla del Sol trek in Bolivia is better done as a day hike instead of a multiple day trek described in the book. Also, campsites on Ausangate trek mentioned in the book are not situated in the most optimal locations and most trekkers supported by local guides camp in better spots. Finally, the book fails to convey the idea that even for experienced hikers most treks, esp. in Peru and Bolivia, really need to be contracted with local guides and/or pack animals for safety and more enjoyment... I would not recommend using this book as a trail guide without making inquiries locally, but it is still a good source of ideas, if you plan to trek in Central Andes."
2,Limited usefulness once in country,"I tried to use this book as my only travel guide (apart from the LP Peru or Bolivia). It has very limited info on bus routes, city maps, and other practical info common in LP country guides, so it is not meant to be used alone. And where it is strong in giving trek descriptions, it admits it should not be used as a trail map-guide. Most treks are affordably run out of local agencies with guides, so I didn't even bring the book with me on the trail. It is best used for pre-trip planning back home, deciding which treks you want to plan your itinerary around once in country. The LP country guide is really all you'll need."
4,"Good source of information, but lacks some of the nice features found in other LP trakking guides","I endorse other reviewer's opinion that the book is useful in particular as a pre-trip planning. In this sense, in my opinion the book is well written, and contains a wealth of information on the subject. However, by comparing it for example with the similar LP guide *Trekking in the Indian Himalaya"", it lacks some useful information, like description of side-trips, e.g. easy climbings along the trek. In addition, the index contains only geographical locations, which limits its usefullness."
2,Lacking in production qualities,"On the technical side of the recording, this album didn't deserve to be on SACD. It's studio engineering is doubdtful at best, not leaving sufficient basic qualities on tape to transfer on such a high resolution format. The surround layer is unlistenable, as if they were sitting in a tunnel when it was recorded. The stereo layer of the SACD is better balanced, but nowhere near all other quality recordings by most other jazz and classical artists. Bottom line: This singer/musician sounds more like a seasoned amateur who recorded his album down in his basement."
2,Kilted Kutie Plays the Funky French Horn,"As with unauthorized biographies, Ewan McGregor: From Scotland to the Stars is a composite of brief television clips and interviews which purport to examine the phenomenal young Scottish actor. The high point is McGregor at his most intriguing first music recital on national television where his impish nose-wiping on his sleeve was cut out (thank you very much, Mr. BBC-man). A souvenier compendium of the actor is no more than snippets with narrative. Not necessary for a video library for those over the age of 13 unless a die-hard Ewan fanatic."
4,Recommended for knowledgable Giger fans...,"This edition is entirely in German and is probably the hardest Giger book for American fans to swallow. Nevertheless, the drawings are fascinating and should thrill anyone who has followed Giger's art from the ""Necronomicon"" books to the present."
2,bad idea,I'm a huge fan of giger but i've not bought this book because it is in german. Why did they publish this in america with german text? Was it some kind of joke? I'm still waiting to buy a version with english text.....
1,Garbage,"Bought this from a dept. store. $25 I'll never get back. Will not fly! Tried adjusting the bridle numerous times. Nothing. The spreader hardware was cheap and was bending, near breaking apart just from regular assembly. Do not buy. Spend a little more and get something from a strictly kite company."
2,An Old Tale of Political Scandal,"In it's time the subject matter of this book was probably a lot more suspenseful. It's a sweet tale of politics and romance with the possibility of a scandal. The suspense is low with emphasis on character development. Two really good looking, very noble, very 'nice' characters. If nothing else it will remind you of a time when the hero and heroines of romance had to be clean and wholesome with no flaws. That used to be a formula that worked well."
5,A Great Starter Book,"Baby Mickey's Nap is a great beginning book for your little one. Made of durable, wipe off material, you won't have to worry about letting your little one 'messing up' the pages.In this book Mickey is going to take a nap and is deciding what to sleep with. He thinks about his blocks, but they are too hard; or his duck, but it is too wet. In this work, children are encouraged to think about how things feel, to touch them and understand the different textures of the world they live in.A real learning read. Recommended.Shirley Johnson"
4,Hawai'ian lullabies,"The gentle sounds of Hawai'i don't just work for small children, put on this CD and even adults will soon be 'drifting off'!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"This book is very misleading. It does not actually tell you how to grow, choose or dry the herbs. The description of the herbs could be better. I am extremely disappointed with this book and would not recommend it!!!"
2,What you should expect.,"You get what you pay for. Normally I play Hohner Special 20 or Lee Oscars. This harmonica played very airy and was off key. Even after tuning, the harp just didn't play right; i also thought the hole size was too small. Like I said you can't be too picky it was only like 6$ so if you want a gift for your kid there ya go. once he/she gets better spend 30$ =P"
1,Look for anything else,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas. The first one was dirty and looked used right out of the box. I emailed Amazon.com and they sent a replacement right away. When I got the replacement it looked as bad as the original.My wife cleaned one up and is using it, but it has problems. The water level indicator is nearly impossible to read and the cover doesn't close or open correctly.The best I can say is it works, but I couldn't recommend it unless you don't care what it looks like or how much water you're heating."
2,Non-ergonomic kettle difficult to use,"We recently replaced an older Phillips cordless kettle with this model (in orange) from Bodum. We love the fun color, but don't enjoy using the kettle. The handle is uncomfortable to hold and awkward for pouring, the spout design makes the kettle difficult to fill, and the kettle makes no sound when the water is done. If you use your cordless kettle a lot, I would definitely recommend looking for something more ergonomic, even if it isn't as aesthetically pleasing."
2,Plastic flakes in the water--Not good!,"I have had my Bodum pot for 4 or 5 years and use it every day. For the past year, I have noticed black granules or flakes in my hot water. The pot I have is white but the heating area inside on the bottom is black. This bothers me, especially after reading about the dangers of heating in plastic. Although the pot heats fine, does not leak, I am replacing it with one with a stainless steel interior."
1,Didn't work right from day 1,"From the very first day, the on-off switch worked intermittently. After a month, it stopped working completely and I had to return the kettle.I found the design of the water viewing ""bubbles"" on the side impractical to use. The water viewing bubbles are so small, I couldn't really see the water level and had to peek in the top of the kettle to gauge the height of the water.Poor design overall."
5,perfect,Heats quickly and shuts off for safety. Pot is a little heavy when filled with water but otherwise this is perfect for heating water for my tea.
1,"Not quality, Just a nice looking kettle.",Lid broke off fairly early. Handle has sharp edges and is not comfortable. After a year of use it moans loudly when heating. No working auto shut-off; it will boil violently if unattended. But it still looks good and heats water. I'm pitching it after a year.
1,Not what I expected,I had hoped this book would deal with relationships between men & women that did not just revolve around romance. But I found it lacking.
1,It's a waste of money.,"I ordered this product. What I got in return was the Titanium Grey version, even though the red phone costs a little more. No explanation offered. To make matters worse, the grey phone did not work with Windows VISTA. Oh well, live and learn! Neither the product nor its seller are worthy of a positive recommendation."
1,Save your money!,"When I ran this flag up the flag pole, I noticed that something wasn't right. When I brought it down the top grommet was split and had to be replaced. Off to the hardware store and spent $4 for replacement grommet package. I contacted these folks about the problem and here is the response:""flags once flown can not be warrantied.sorry.. this is policyclint""I should have spent the extra few bucks and got a better flag. Customer service is very poor."
2,Not a flag for southeast-Texas weather,"I have sent some pictures with this review that shows what the - ""all-weather,outdoor, will last for years"" - flag looked like after nine months in the southeast-Texas weather. The sun, rain and wind caused the flag to rip along the sewn seams. The material has become very brittle and cracks have developed along with small holes. But for about seven months the flag looked great with color fastness; and the brass grommets held fast. I give it two stars for the six to seven months of good use that it gave before it started to deteriorate."
3,Not so Heavyweight...,"I feel I was a little misled on the 100% ""Heavyweight"" nylon. I would not consider it heavyweight at all. Also, I bought this item for a Christmas gift so when I got the item and opened it to wrap it didnt have a package of any type. It was rolled in a plastic bag so I was a little disappointed I didnt get the original packaging with it. I guess the seller was trying to save on shipping costs. Overall, decent purchase."
5,American Flag Excellent Product,"I received the American flag in a timely fashion and it was as advertised. The proof of durabiity and wear will be in the pudding, however. The last one I bought had a similar write-up to this one - paying the bigger bucks because it was supposed to last forever. This one is a different material so only time will tell if it holds its colors. But no problem so far after a couple of months. As I said in the title - ..... and Excellent Product."
5,Great Puzzle,When I first saw this puzzle I was surprised as it looked just like my cat. The puzzle is now part of our Artwork.
4,A Judicious Mixture Of Standards,"Harry Parry is enjoying something of a revival, with currently no fewer than three CDs devoted to his memory, and this one is well up to Mike Dutton's usual high standard of remastering. It contains a judicious mixture of standards, many associated with Benny Goodman or Artie Shaw, plus a number of Parry's own compositions. Listening to it, I couldn't help feeling at times that this music should be played with somewhat less reserve, but that minor cavil should not deter you from ordering it whilst it's still available."
3,It's OK,"I have used this scanned quite a bit. It quit working after about 8 months (still under warranty), but was repaired locally at no cost to me. It's been working fine lately, although I'm not using it as hard as I had been at the time."
2,Does NOT work at 1200dpi,"The LiDE 50 will not scan at 1200dpi. I'm running a 1Ghz Athlon with 256MB of RAM and plenty of system resources in Windows 2000 Professional. The scans just ""hang"" at 20% or 90% and never finish. Also, parts in the internal mechanism of the scanner I recieved appear to have minor corrosion on them.I returned the unit and did not waste time with a replacement."
2,If you want to scan more than one page- forget it !,"This scanner is sleek and does not need a lot of space, due to its design and the wonderful single USB cable connection. The scans are of good or very good quality (compared to HP).However the printer driver is unbelievable annoying. You have the option to use default scanning settings ( for b&w;, greyscale, magazine, text) or to manually adjust the settings for each picture. The options are standard but the preview window is very small (too small). Thus you have to guess very often. But the worst feature of this driver is, that there is no way to save some of your own settings. You have to make the same adjustments all over again - for every single page of a document you are scanning ! (This affects every software you are using).This is unacceptable - on the other hand they deliver a well working OCR program with scanner (0mnipage). What are they thinking?"
2,LiDE 50 on Linux a no go,"If you plan to use the Canon CanoScan LiDE 50 on Linux, you're currently out of luck. Of the LiDE scanners, the Sane (Scanner Access Now Easy - http://www.sane-project.org/) project only supports the LiDE 20 and 30. That's why only 3 stars.BTW, though this is labeled as a USB 2.0 product, it also works with USB 1.1."
5,Awsome Scanner Dudes!,"I had a Canon FB630 that went belly up so I bought a Epson perfection scanner because Consumer Reports rated it a fast scanner. Yeah Right! Its fast alright, after it takes time to warm up. So I sold the Epson and bought the Canon Lide 50, Damm! I thought it was the second coming of Christ! No warm up, goes right into a scan and its fast. The scans come out very clean. I would highly recommend this scanner to anyone. The only thing I miss is the Fax button on the canoscan toolbox."
1,I will never buy another Canon product of any kind,"I'm a very experienced computer user, having started with an MITS Altair back in the 1970s and having had almost everything else since then.I bought a Canon LIDE 50 to replace an aging Astra UMAX scanner.I've been able to make the Canon work mostly with Windows XP, although its supplied software is terrible.I have been completely unable to make this piece of junk work with my Macintosh. It just doesn't work. Period. Canon's support has been useless, and now that I've upgraded to Leopard, I'm told that by Canon that they WILL NOT EVER SUPPORT THIS PRODUCT on 10.5 or newer operating systems.So Canon, kiss my backside. In some years, I spend up to $2M on computer systems on behalf of my employer and clients. You'll never see a dime of it.Have a nice day."
3,Problems with installation under OS 10.3.9 MacIntosh,"I am writing this review for the benefit of iMac users (flat panel) who have difficulties installing or re-installing the software. The trouble during installation is due to the lack of authority. Therefore, log in as system administrator and perform the installation as such. Make sure that you first install the Canosan software and afterwards the LIDE 50 driver. I used the 4.1.3 version of Canoscan (CSTb4130MXE.dmg) and the 7.3.1 version of the driver (LiDE50_OSX_v7134X.app.sit). Works perfectly and always.The LIDE 50 is a competent scanner and, if you can get hold of one, one of the cheapest around."
1,I can't say enough bad things about its OS X Drivers,"I got one of these for a friend and I am appalled at how bad the drivers are for OS X.The scanner does NOT work with OS X's ""Image Capture"" application, and the provided application is hideous.It looks ugly.It has horribly translated dialogs and instructions.I can't even allow you to select standard applications (such as Preview) for viewing the scans."
3,good but not the best,"I like A Sei Voci as a very good Josquin ensemble, bad luck for them that there exists a Tallis Scholars interpretation of the same works. I think A Sei Voci does not come near to the overwhelming singing of Tallis Scholars and Peter Phillips conceptual approach to these two different master pieces."
4,double CD,"When this product arrived, oh surprise! it was a double CD (I did not expect that).The first CD is top quality. And this is what I ordered. The second one is not nearly as good, but since I was not expecting it, it does not matter.Good music! Enjoy! :-]"
2,Did someone proofread this before publishing?,"What appeared to be a good story on an amazing cancer drug discovery turns out to be a disappointment in reading experience.There is no doubt that the author is intelligent; (given that he did find this amazing drug and remains to be a CEO of a huge pharmaceutical company) but someone should have helped him out with his writing.There were run on sentences, misspelled words and the flow of his writing doesn't get the reader excited. Instead, it conveys a sense of sensationalism and unnecessary drama."
3,Rent it. Nice reading,"The issue is about cancer patients, their pain and a miracle drug.The book sails through story of development of ""Gleevec"" pill. This medicine cured people with specific kind of cancer and saved lives.It shows that a great deal of effort required over a sustained period of time from individual contributors that brought such a revolutionary medicine."
5,A beautiful cd,"Just had to correct the impression left by the other review. The music on this album is sublime, one of the best in the 4AD label style and one of the favorites of my couple thousand CDs."
2,Bujold stubs her toe,"Firstly, I have devoured and loved everything this writer has done. Miles Vorkosigan and the first book in this series rock. This book seems an ill-considered amalgam of bits of Chaucer's pilgramage tales and the 70's daytime soap opera ""Dark Shadows"", with its endless chatter and lack of action concerning an undead milquetoast vampire. Better luck next book Ms. Bujold."
3,Competent,"This is a solid fantasy novel. The base of the plot is conventional but developed in greater detail than most such books. Bujold has created a world in which the supernatural directly contacts the material world and develops a mythic-theological structure in a fairly rigorous way. The plot itself is based on a clever combination of the sleeping beauty and doppelganger stories. The main character undergoes a trial that is an act of personal redemption that mirrors a prior mistaken action. The quality of writing, however, is not outstanding. Some aspects of the story resemble a romance novel and sections are redundant. Another defect is that this book is a sequel and reading the prior book, The Curse of Chalion, is necessary to understand the background and characters in this book."
1,"Awful. Not up to her usual awesomeness. Slow, ugly.","I struggled to identify with her main character, a ""washed up"" 30-something widow with two children. She felt old and ugly, and so did I reading this book.Sections were brilliant, and the overall plot was decent but slow.Her descriptions of women being interested by men are infuriating for some reason. For some reason I think she writes attraction from the male point of view much better than the female.The Vorkosigan series are much better than these. I hate it when I see an awesome author seem to get worse as they move on and write other series. I pushed through the first one, and did finish this one, but had to complain about the writing and slowness at least once per reading session.If you're looking for something, I'd suggest the Red Wolf Conspiracy by Redick. Or any of Bujold's Vorkosigan books."
5,"Looking to be disappointed, but I wasn't","I won't go into the story, but after loving the Curse of Chalion, and wanting to hear more about the main character, this book came out. I did not want to hear about Ista, was not interested in her character, wanted more of Caz. I began this book wanting to dislike it, but Ista and her supporting cast pulled me out of my funk to really enjoy this story and her character. I would gladly read anything else she follows up with regarding these characters or this world."
2,A mere shadow of The Curse of Chalion,"This book is nowhere near as exciting as the first book. If you really liked all of the ""mumbo jumbo theology"" aspects of the first book, then this is the book for you. If you liked the action and characters of The Curse of Chalion, then this is not the book for you. Ista is not near as interesting as Cazaril or even Iselle."
5,Liked it more than the first,"I realized this book was going to be about one of the more minor cahracters from the fiurst book, and I was not expecting too much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The characters are well written and interesting. I am not a big writer of reviews. However I am trying, and this is one of those books. I found the writing to be very smooth, the sort of book that I found hard to put down and looking forward to sitting down with again. This series is the first I have read by this author, but I am anxious to start number 3 here in a few minutes. I also am looking forward to reading her other series."
3,Unsatisfactory,"No complaints about adventure and mystery, but somehow the setup feels forced instead of genuine mishap. Almost instantaneously a woman was given the wisdom and perceptiveness that Vorkorsigan and Cazaril acquired in a lifetime. Almost no Chalion couriers noticed the turmoil at a border state. And almost no one called spiritual emergency (or at least alarmed some archdivine) aside from praying for relief. Good for flying-solo heroism; unsatisfactory for plot and world-building."
2,A disappointing sequel to the terrific Curse of Chalion but ...,"[***** = breathtaking, **** = excellent, *** = good, ** = flawed, * = bad]... that may be due to Ista who feels so bitter about life. Plus the invasions from the barbarians across the border got repetitive. Longer review at ImpatientReader-dot-com."
5,A more than worth sequel,"I loved the Curse of Chalion; this sequel is at least as good. The first book barely touched on the intriguing former Royina Ista. In this book she attempts to take ownership of her life, and does so with possibly a bit more divine urging than Cazaril had received."
5,Wonderful!,At first I could not picture any way for a sequel to Curse of Chalion to make sense- I should have trusted Lois. This is a wonderful direction to take the story while allowing the first book to stand on its own.
3,Entertaining but not really special.,"This is quite a good book with an interesting main character and a reasonable plot.It does rely heavily on the gods to sort problems out and the other characters are all a bit clichéd but the pace is quick and the relationship between Ista and the gods, particularly the Bastard, is interesting and supplies some humour.The ending is a little too easy though, everything tied in a neat little bow courtesy of the gods."
5,Terrific book. Highly recommended,"This book came highly recommended by a friend who knows my taste in fantasy, and I was not disappointed. Engaging, creative, interesting, this story was one of my favorites by Ms. Bujold. The characters were very real to me. Highly recommended story."
2,I expected better,"** spoiler alert ** The beginning is terribly slow. I could hardly drag myself through the pages. The book picks up appreciably in the middle, comes to a decent (if predictable and barely harrowing) climax, and then limps ... and limps ... to the end. The characters were somewhat interesting, although there is a whole lot of introspection ... almost too much, really. Didn't really see any serious flaws in the main (good guy) characters, which was disappointing.I liked the idea of demons and sorcery, though I did not like the change in the characterization of demonic possession: early on, terrible consequences are hinted at, but by the end of the book there are demons aplenty and seemingly no consequences for those dabbling with demonic power. Even a cuddly demon horse for the heroine to ride. Anyway, I suppose if this book hadn't won a Hugo I wouldn't have been so disappointed, but as it was I left feeling fairly unsatisfied. I'll try Vorkosigan, maybe, but I'm done with Chalion."
5,Great sequel,"Paladin is a great sequel to Curse of Chalion. I would say that it is, in fact, a better book. I was not thrilled to begin the book and find out that McMaster Bujold had abandoned her original characters from Curse and started again with one of the minor characters in this new book. I usually do not like sequels that do that.But really, it is a wonderful book, full of the wry wit that characterized Cordelia in McMaster Bujold's early Vorkosigan books. A wonderful read."
3,"Like it, but it needs more hooks","This is an attractive and easy way to hang all sorts of things. I have two of these at the top of my basement stairs and it holds brooms, etc., for easy access. There's not much storage space in my small condo, so this way of storing things is a plus. There is only one problem. It only comes with two hooks and finding more is very difficult. I ended up buying some hooks from a kitchen supply store after a long time searching for hooks that would work properly. I finally found some but feel that the company who sells this item should make the hooks easily available if they're going to sell the grid."
5,Twice a Thousand Told Fairy Tales,"Beautifully written and illustrated, it makes a perfect bedtime story. You will also get distracted by the artwork: it could tell the story without the words."
5,Beautiful Pictures!,The pictures in this book are just gorgeous and the story is beautifully told. I love reading this book to my children!
5,Was he right or wrong? How big will the flood be?,"I have an even older version of this book.Fontenay talked about a catalyzed fusion process not unlike the suspect cold fusion process. He didn't know about global warming but he suspected that the weight of the oceans would change the equilibriumof the land with the ocean.I just finished ""The Coming Global Superstorm"" by Art Bell and Whitley Strieber and it paints another picture entirelyof rapid climate change.What they share is the depiction of a disaster due to humantechnology changing the world; more or less horror movie types scenarios. Unless we do something about the conditions evolving at this moment this kind of situation might actually develop in our times."
1,Misleading + Racist = poor novel,"I was deeply disappointed in this novel and teh blantantly misleading advertising for it. I will no give any plot points from this crappy book, but there are a couple points where you realize that you have been duped into giving away your $5 or so. Save your $ for a Ludlum, Crichton or le Carre novel and pass up this waste of paper."
2,Ken,"I liked the book, but if you've ever been to GA... to go from Athens to Atlanta by way of Red Top Mtn & Lake Allatoona, you would probably detour by way of Chattanooga, TN. This is STUPID. The writer & EDITORS should check their directions. I've ""written Steven Coont's off my list of readables"" for the same reason.KEN L from Spring, TX."
4,A Mythic Thriller,"As a professor of Greek myths and literature, I found this first novel quite enjoyable. A good mix of suspense, a hint of romance, ancient and recent history. I've visited the sites in Greece which the author describes and they are accurately portrayed, providing a fine backdrop for the story. I look forward to other books by AJ Hartley."
3,A quick read.,"This book is a quick read. I enjoyed reading it because it moved fast once you get about 100 pages in. There's not a lot of thinking needed when reading this book, which is not a good thing since I believe books (especially fiction) should be somewhat thought provoking.pros- a solid heroin, murder, nazi'scons- are we that foolish to believe that museums do not have security cameras?"
5,Intrigue and Suspense,"'The mask of Atreus' is one of those rare mystery novels that combines an exciting story line, rich in history and archaelogical detail with a quality of writing which is a joy to read. The book is an extremely accessible read without being patronising and the chapters move in a sharply paced style.Gradually the reader is drawn into this intriguing novel and kept guessing.The characters are well delineated and believable, whilst the plot has many twists and turns building up tension and suspense and the compulsion to keep turning the pages.To say more would spoil the mystery. Read and enjoy!"
3,Not as good as Tears of the Jaguar,I ordered because I like Tears of the Jaguar by same author. The writing wasn't as crisp as Tears and the plot not as good.
3,"Good, not great","The Mask of Atreus is the second book I've read by A.J. Hartley. I liked it, but still was a bit disappointed because I really loved his book What Time Devours. This one is well-written, and I found most of the characters interesting. It made me wish I knew a little more about Greek mythology, but not enough that I will look for a book on the subject. There were a few too many curves in the story for my liking; by the end I was getting a bit impatient with the twists. But the lead character is well detailed, and I found her believable, other than wondering how I had missed that she was wealthy enough to take off on trips overseas with about 30 minutes consideration."
3,good book - bad promo,"First - I enjoyed the book. The pacing was good, the main character was flawed (which is good to see in an action thriller - no superhero), the puzzle was interesting and done well. I would maybe read the author again.Second - I very much dislike when publishers mispromote there books.Counter to the cover blurbs this book was not scary,spooky,or horror.I thought it would be a little bit Dan Brown with a horror angle - not at all. Disappointing! Also, the book had 4 testimonials from otherauthors(they claim bestselling?) and it was actually the same 2 authors twice each. Silly!"
1,"Disappointing, to say the least","I was very disappointed with this mystery/suspense novel. The plot was so full of red herrings and ludicrous trips abroad that it made no sense. The heroine, a museum curator, tries to solve the mysterious death of her boss, who was hiding a collection of artifacts from her. However, we soon realize that 1. the artifacts are priceless, 2. oops, maybe they are fakes, 3. they have something to do with WWII, 4. that neo-nazis abound in Georgia, 5. that anyone can hop on a plane to Russia and unearth buried secrets from 70 years ago knowing no Russian, 6. Same goes for Greece, but knowing not a word of Greek.All in all, this book was one of the worst I have read of the genre."
2,A Disappointment,"I was expecting something more scholarly I suppose. The Gourmet Atlas contains: some great maps of the migration of foodstuffs; recipes which look good; time-lines; charts and some wonderful photos and pretty pictures. But this visual appeal is at the expense of the text, which I found light-weight, and the writing is sometimes confusing. If you are serious about food then this is lacking in many areas - no bibliography or references for starters and I found some factual errors. The very short introduction promises that the atlas will be THE source for the avid student and casual inquirer. The serious student would be better to stick to something like Waverley Root's FOOD.Meanwhile I await Alan Davidson's The Oxford Companion to Food. The Gourmet Atlas is a pretty book and could prove quite handy butis hardly a definitive reference. Good for someone starting out with an interest in food."
1,not a great atlas of foods,"I am currently taking an upper division geography course on food topics and we are using the ""The Gourmet Atlas"" as a text. The general feeling of the class is that the maps in this book lack a reasonable cartographic approach. This is quite sad considering that it is an 'atlas'. However, the book does offer some background knowledge on various kinds of foods(though minimal). I personally think the subject the authors tried to take on is extremely fascinating but the manner in which they did so was not successful."
5,Lovely book,I found this book to be a wonderful addition to my ever growing snake referencing materials. I appreciate the colored pictures.
1,Tiny -- bulbs stick out beyond the shade,This is a tiny light and the shades are so small that a standard light bulb sticks out beyond and below the shade.
5,Awesome!,"This light is very unique in it's design. We hung it over our vanity when we remodeled our bathroom. It's very bright, was easy to put together and hang."
5,ROYCE HAS IT!,"I bought this for my bathroom which has only one ceiling light. I don'thave it up yet, but I took it out of the box, and....I LOVE IT. I trulyrecommend all of ROYCE light fixtures, and Amazon has the best prices.I'm gonna GET'ER DONE!"
4,Rarity,"The quainter with Konitz is worthwhile because is shows both masters at a young age in very rare performances. The sextet with Mclean is good, but Jackie still suffers from a huge Parker influence; he still had not developed fully his distinctive and beautiful sound."
3,GPS SD Card,The SD card works fine. One problem I had is this is a micro SDcard so it needs an adapter to fit in the SD card slot on myGarmin GPS. The micro SD card came in a Garmin package but noadapter. There was an empty space in the package where it looks like their should have been an adapter. I was leaving for Spain the dayafter I rcvd the sd card so I had to go to radio shack to buy anadapter. The company needs to specify whether the package containsand adapter or if you need to purchase it separately.
2,Garmin Spain & Portugal City Navigator,Slow to find satellite signalKept losing signalMay have been worth renting or buying onein Europe especially with all the newhighways.
2,how to install,"I have not yet figured out how to install this on my Nuvi 1450. When I try, I get the message that there is not enough room on my device. Don't know what I can delete on my Nuvi to make room for my map of Spain."
2,"Lack of accuracy in highways and cities, don't waste your money","Bought it for 8 days of driving in Andalucia and Catalunya on vacations. Several mistakes with streets that did not exist, suggestions against traffic rules, wrong turns. Inconceivable for a product of this price in these times. Next time I would spend more in the European sim card data allowance and use my android phone."
2,weird tab,"A great collection of songs. Unfortunately, the tabulature has the notes in between the lines (like piano music) instead of on the line like traditional banjo music. It was so hard to follow I acutally had to transpose the songs I wanted to learn. I really like that there is piano music to accompany the banjo music."
1,I've had better companions...,"A big bore. Homogeneous selections. No Aboriginal stories of worth. Sameness of style, plot, location added to drudgery--and I really wanted to be entertained on the 15 hour flight. Few of the stories held my interest. Later I realized that the major problem is that the collection didn't really paint an accurate picture of these incredibly diverse, lively, creative,spontaneous, brave people and fierce, glorious habitats. Not at all the Best of Australia--my Aussie friends (well-read) had not heard of the majority of authors. Not worth the weight to carry home. I threw it out in the hotel."
5,Awesome DVD!,"I got this DVD for my 3 year old niece, specifically for when I baby-sit her, which is often. She's a sweet, beautiful child, but also ...um... let's just say she can be a handful. I have tried lots of books, games, crafts, and other videos, but so far this DVD is the best. As soon as I bring out the DVD, she gets excited at first, but then sits right down to get ready for the show. She really enjoys the monkey & banana segments. And I really enjoy a little peace and quiet!"
1,better than nothing,"The speaker looks okay, but the volume is so low and un-ajustable!!! Plus, You need to buy an extra AC adpater (or batteries). Considering how much shipping fee you pay, a $ some speaker from a local store is much better than this. Like another victim, I am gona keep it as a toy for my son."
3,ok computer speakers,"These computer speakers are ok they were cheap, you get what you pay for.The Sony name is what caught my eye and I thought they would sit well for my computer but they are a bit ackward."
3,4 times better than SRS-A27 for 1/4 price!!!,"actually, this speaker is same as SRS-A21 (old version, with paper dome)though it's not as good as SRS-Z500(!!!), this is excellent for the priceSRS-A27, on the other hand, NEVER BUY IT, PERIOD, the sound is just better than noise!!! NO BASS AT ALL!!!if you planning to buy SRS-A27, you should check this first"
1,Disappointed because the product was beautiful!,The holes were too small for our toothbrushes - even our toddler's toothbrush! We were really disappointed because the product was beautiful and would have coordinated so well with our new bathroom fixtures.
1,Waste of my money,How do I get my money returned for this crap. I'm glad I only bought the first episode. I deleted it half way through thats how bad it was!
2,Too fuddy duddy,"The CD is too short and too old fashioned. I prefer a more update modern sound for my Pilates class, like the Mat Pilates PowerMix CD's."
2,Not too happy,I haven't even had this wheel cover a year and it already has a tear in it. It was extremely difficult to put on the steering wheel. Not happy with it at all. Save your money.
2,Umm started slow,"Alright the show really was drawn rough and the animation and design got better towards the end but I couldn't deal with the writing. This show was really one big racist stereotype, I mean just look at the villains, majority were black and involved in a huge gang war and their powers embraced the stereotypes. Statics sister was loud and obnoxious and WAY too many rappers and basketball players in this show guest starring. Even the trip to Africa was a bit over the top. Just starts off way to offensive but does have its moments once it found it's footing."
5,Great Show,"To put it strait out, great, fantastic and original. This is a 12 year old talking about a kid show. Still it has a great plot and story line. To make it short and sweet.BUY THIS GAME"
2,Horrid Show,"This show is terrible. Though these few episodes are enjoyable(that's why I gave this a 2/5 instead of a 1/5), the series itself is terrible for children. Let's list the non children features shown in the show in total, shall we?1. Static Shock complains that there are not enough black superheroes. RACIST TV FOR KIDS?!?!?! THAT'S HORRIBLE! I can think of many black heroes(Luke Cage, Bishop, Black Spider, Amazing Man 1, Amazing Man 2, Black Racer, Joshua Clay, Cyborg, Steel 1, Steel 2, must I go on?).2. A KID SHOT RICHIE IN THE KNEE CAP! That's not right for a children's show!3. Static said suck. I usually don't care, but that's something not for today's young.4. RICHIE PUNCHED VIRGIL OVER A FIGHT! THAT'S HORRIBLE! A SUPERHERO FIGHT IS ONE THING, BUT TALKING?!?! WHAT A KID SHOW! *rolls eyess)I can go on forever, but it seems you get my point."
1,Static Shock is a dumb show for a number of reasons,"When I first watched this show it was very dull. He can throw electricity... wow, big deal. Also they could've done a better job drawing Virgil's dreads... they're not dreads. Justice League is a much better show. WB, you really disappointed me this time."
5,Great,I bought this for my cousin because he loves static shock an it no longer comes on tv and this was the only DVD we found thanks Amazon....
3,Good serie... but in this disc...,This was an excellent series. I really wanted to see it again. It was very frustrating for me when I couldn't see the second of the following chapters it brings because of scratches.
4,I Like Static Shock,"It was the first 6 episodes of the series plus some decent extras. For $3 plus $3 s/h- it was worth it. I went to Wiki to see what's going to happen to Static next and was pleasantly surprised:(In June of 2010, DC Comics announced that Static would be receiving his own series in 2011. The series will be written by Felicia Henderson and drawn by Scott McDaniel.)"
4,it's a shocker!,well......i like comics.....even though it is geared toward kids. this is a good modern day anime about the many struggles people (men and woman) face in the torture years of grade school all the way through high school. it's a good buy. i just hope the company decides to release the rest of the season's episodes.
4,An Electric Superheroe,"Static/Virgil Hawkins really has to be the first African-American superhero that we've ever really had to look up to. I really like this show. It's creative and deals with important issues and politics, but in an easy format that kids can understand. The show even takes the leap into dealing with topics like racism and high school gun shooting. Virgil Hawkin has lost his mother because of gang violence and is now being raised by his dad and his older sister Sharon. His best friend is Richie Foley (who later on in the series, has a much more important role.)My only complaint is that this DVD only contains the first six episodes of the series. I wish that it would had been the release of season one rather than just a few episodes. You can get so much more on one disk these days. I would love to see a completed set of all four seasons on DVD someday, or at least volume two for season one."
5,Excellent DVD for an excellent show.,"This is probably one of the best kids shows that has been aired in a very long time. The story is solid, the characters are interesting, likable, and unique, and it teaches morales to boot. It covered many issues in it's 4 years of airing, from racism (a rarity for childrens shows), to kids who turn to guns to solve their problems (where Richie gets shot in the knee cap. Trust me, parents, there has been far worse on childrens TV, and it's not graphic), to bullying and gang violence. If your looking for a TV show that tries to actually teach your kids something about life, Static Shock is the show to turn to. This DVD covers gang violence, but overall, doesn't exactly showcase the best in Statick when it comes to morale issues. Still, even so, the show is great, and is worth picking up for the super hero lover of the family."
4,"If you love Natalie Portman buy this movie, She Shines in this movie as always.","Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium gets four stars overall. Natalie Portman gets a five star rating because she shines in this movie as always. If you love Natalie Portman this is the only reason you need to buy this movie. I give the story three stars because its O.K. but not to deep, or to detailed, but it's a ""kids"" movie made for kids and one of the better ones around (Not the typical stupid type with stupid jokes or jesters to get a cheep laugh). I would not have bought this movie before seeing it first if Natalie Portman was not staring in this movie. I have LOVED her from the first movie I saw her in (The Professional) to her most recent ones. Portman is in most of the scenes in ""...Emporium"" which is why this movie works. The story has a good meaning - believe in yourself, and make your own MAGIC!!!"
2,Nothing wonderful about this movie!!,"Some cute special effects but other than that a pretty boring flick.Wear your P.J.'s as this film will put you to sleep. It immediately went in our stack of DVD's to get rid of. It is a ""message film"". By the time I found out ""the message"", all I could think of was the amount of time I had wasted watching this film."
2,"It's like ""The Neverending Story""","Honestly, I am 23 years old. I watched this movie because it was written and directed by Zach Helm, who did ""Stranger Than Fiction"". I was hoping for something as creative and meaningful as that movie, but I was disappointed. This movie is for children, and it's special effects are now(2010) severely outdated(and not in a charming way). The plot is similar to ""The Neverending Story"", except newer and more complicated. Some of the ""magical"" scenes seem to drag on awkwardly long and don't add anything to the story. Dustin Hoffman delivers a respectable performance as does the young outcast boy, but Natalie Portman is not at her best. I do not recommend this film to anyone. Even for children there are better movies that deliver the same message."
2,At least the children liked it...,"The only think that saved this from being a one-star movie is that my children thought it was okay.We paid 50 cents per person to see it, and it was not worth it!The acting was no good. The movie didn't make a whole lot of sense. It had so much potential as a story - but none of it was developed. What about the guy in the basement? Why was she so blase about her job? What did Mr. Magorium see in her anyway?Now, I like children's movies as much as the next guy (or child) but this was a snoozer loser. Two thumbs down."
2,Cheese,Good story but mostly cheese acting and cg...geared towards kids. Not much of a story for adults. Your kids might like the flick but I was bored.
4,Good,"The wife actually ordered this film. We have different tastes, but it was enjoyable. No defects in the movie. It was delivered in very short period of time. Thanks again."
3,Memaw,"Saw this movie previewed on another movie and thought it looked good.It was a good movie, but not as good as I thought it would be.Amazon did a great job with my order and will order again."
3,Fantasy that falls a little short of good.,"This movie was ordered on an impulse; I'd heard some good things about it and decided to try it out. After watching it once, I had not seen it when it was released in the theaters; it impressed me as a moderately charming fantasy if you were prepared to accept its assumptions.This is true of most movies and I usually don't have too much trouble doing that but this time it just didn't seem to work as well for me. The production of the movie seemed too formulaic, the impression is they were just trying too hard to make it work and it just didn't quite come off right. Too many aspects of the movie were just a little bit over the top.As I look back I come to the conclusion it might have been better just to rent the movie instead of buy it; I'll watch the movie again just to check my impressions and if I revise my thinking I'll update this review."
4,"Poignant, Funny & Heartwarming Story. However...","The directorial debut of a man whose name I don't remember is funny, charming, heartwarming and poignant all in one. Starring Academy Award winner Dustin Hoffman (Best Actor, ""Rain Man"") and Natalie Portman (the ""STAR WARS"" prequels), the film begins very well, establishing that Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman) is the narrator's only friend. I enjoyed the all-too brief scene when they hug. However, once the movie made a point of the narrator making friends with ""The Mutant,"" I thought, ""Oh, gross. WHY DO THEY HAVE TO INCLUDE A MALE CHARACTER BEFRIENDING A BOY? UGH."" I HATED the scene where Molly is a bit rude to the boy later in the movie (idiot screenwriter). Also that their relationship stalled out after that. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Rated G."
2,Not the best,I'm usually quite a fan of Dustin Hoffman as well as most kids movies but I found this movie pretty boring and extremely silly even for a kids movie.
3,Never watched it,"This was offered as a streaming video as a bonus with purchase of the dvd, but the dvd was a gift for a kid. Nice idea, but not my kind of film."
5,Mr. Magorium Delights,"I found the story emotionally moving and delightful to watch. It even has a line that resonates long after the film concludes: ""Your life is an occasion: rise to it."" Well-acted."
3,"Conceptually interesting, but...","The movie concept was interesting, and I could easily see a child adoring such a magical place. I also liked watching the growth of the characters. At times, I felt like the movie moved slowly or threw the ""believe in yourself"" message at me too often--something I might have minded less if the makers hadn't simultaneously added in a clever word play about the King of Planet Yahweh, but ""there is no king, and Yahweh (another name for God) doesn't exist."" An atheist might not mind, and it went completely over my little boy's head, but it dampened the *wonder* a bit for me."
2,No Willy Wonka,"What a let down this movie was, I really wanted to like it but I did not. No imagination....No wonder.......they spent all the money on sets and promotional material I believe and ten cents on the script WHAT WHERE THEY THINKING."
2,Mr Magorium's Wonder Emporium,"I was disappointed in this. Especially to star Dustin Hoffman and Natalie Porter. It is fair, but not all that much of a story line."
2,twaddle,"Despite a workable premise (magic toy store), this movie is relentlessly depressing. The kids came to see a movie about magic, wonder, and loony fun . . . not about death and decay!And why is Dustin Hoffman still getting roles? He's been playing the same character for the last twenty years! How is he still getting work?"
1,Death watch,"Great movie if you want your kids on a death watch. It is good in so many ways, almost magical, but the main character has chosen the time that he wants to die. Had bought it for the grandkids but could not send it to them because their dad is serving in Iraq and they deal with that issue enough already.Don't buy this movie as it is a real disappointment."
1,Mr. Magoriums Wonder Emporium,"The movie in the case was not the correct movie. It was 101 Dalmations. I have contacted the seller with the necessary information to correct this mistake, but at this time I have not gotten a satisfactory reply or the correct movie has not been sent."
1,dont bother,"Please dont bother watching this movie. I am a movie buff and very rarely do I quit watching a movie. This one however was one of the worst I've ever tried to watch. I am a fan of light hearted, mystical childlike stories but this one was too much to handle. nothing remotely believable about this movie. stupid! dont watch!"
4,"""Life is an occassion - Rise to it!""","A breath of fresh air of a family movie. Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium is simple in its storytelling about believing in your self, finding the magic in your life. It is an enchanting movie; entertaining without the typical hper-action, potty/burping humor or street-smart smack talk so overdone in every other ""family"" movie these days.Charming. Brilliantly understated acting; not over the top in any way, no sterotypical characterizations. Dustin Hoffman, Natalie Portman, Jason Bateman and child actor Zach Mills played true to their characters, filled with wonder, believable. I can only imagine that the movie's negative reviews are based on reviewers having preconcieved ideas of what they ""thought"" the movie would be like. This is a simple Willy Wonka-esque story, 90 minutes of enchanting entertainment without hype or preachiness. Slow down and enjoy it!"
5,Fantastic!,"Both my boys, 8 and 5 loved it and so did my husband. Well worth a family night rental. We are still talking about the movie after watching it over 2 months ago."
3,"Interesting, But Surprisingly Depressing","This is not the happy movie I thought it would be. It has some interesting special effects and excellent actors, but parents should be prepared to explain to their young children why Mr. Magorium had to die. Yes, death is a part of life, but thinking about it all the time is no way to live. I had been to a funeral a few hours before I watched this movie. I was expecting this movie to be more uplifting, but I walked away a bit unsettled."
4,jess,"Very nice movie. Dustin Hoffman is wonderful. I still prefer Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory, but I think that is just my age showing. I think that any kid (kid-at-heart) would love this movie."
3,*Good Movie For Kids!*,I think this movie will be enjoyed by children.It does have a great toy store that kids will wish they could go to.A good fantasy movie for kids.
5,Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium,This is a great movie. I was so glad that it was purchased for me. I saw part of it on broadcast TV and knew that I needed to get a copy. It came in no time and I am very pleased with your service and the product.
3,Magical,"I watched this video outdoors with several families and friends. It was fun, magical and had a great message--something for everyone!"
3,"Oh my goodness, this is sad!","I didn't realize quite how sad it was, but my 9 year old daughter and I were sobbing. Over than that, it's a sweet movie, but not as magical as I expected."
4,Mr Magorium's Wonder Emporium: Fun Holiday Film for the Family,"This is a beautiful film for the holidays. Filled with the childish wonder, imagination and magic expected of holiday films. The special effects are magical, the acting is great and the way the story is told (in storybook form) greatly enhances the plot. This is 100 minutes where you will be freed to relax and let your mind wander. A great film for all audiences at this or any other time of year."
5,Mr.Magorium's Wonder Emporiunm,I love this movie it very funny it an good movie for the family they need make an part 2 to this movie it very good
2,could have been a lot better,"I was really looking forward to this movie after seeing Dustin Hoffman on the Today show and hearing what the story was about. It was an interesting story, but it was done in a very bad way. The story felt like it moved too fast and i never felt like i really developed an attachment to the characters. Then it ended abruptly and did not really give me a chance to settle in to the outcome."
1,this movie was terrible,i was forced to watch it and i knew it would be terrible. the idea was ok but the actors were terrible it was completly random. the characters were not aware what was going on. natalie portmans chracter was confused at somepoint in the movie she was talking to the box and then the next minute she was like what box after she was just talking to it. this movie was stupid and a waste of time.
1,This movies sucks. Buy a happy meal for your kids instead.,"This movie should be avoided for 3 reasons. (1) The movie focuses on the upcoming death of Mr. Magorium. Unless you enjoy discussing death with young children you will be unhappy with this topic. (2) Most of the movie is talking, talking and more talking. There are few...make nearly zero...special effects that are entertaining to children. One special effect is Mr. Magorium dancing on bubble wrap that has been placed on the sidewalk. (Likely the movie producers were on a budget.)(3) The story-line is weak. Merely, Mr. Magorium is dying and he picks his employee of 15 years to succeed him. There is no moral and nothing for children to learn. For these 3 reason, forgetting the slick marketing of this movie and picking any number of tried and true children's movies is the better bet. This is no Willy Wonka movie."
1,don't waste your $$$$$,Could not wait for this bad movie to get over with! Little kids are the only 1's that Might like this.
5,The Second Mark,"Like Seabiscuit, Friday Night Lights, and Eight Men Out, The Second Mark transcends the sports genre. The figure skating is there, all right, but so is the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the lost generation of Mao's Cultural Revolution, a little boy carrying a bedboard down flights of stairs to use as a pingpong table, and a Chinese girl skating by candlelight in a deserted, late night ice rink. In both large strokes and small details, the book takes you, not only into the lives of the six medalists in the Olympics pairs skating competition, but into the cultures from which you cannot separate them.It is an amazing story that unfolds, even if you thought you knew it. Beautifully written and seen--Joy Goodwin's writing is worthy of the story and that is high praise. I loved this book!"
5,Great Book!!,"This book has interesting information on the childhoods, tribulations, and triumphs of Jamie Sale, David Pelletier, Shen Xue, Zhao Hongbo, and Elena Berezhnaya. The one person it is lacking information on is Anton Sikharulidze. It goes through their elite careers and touches on competitions leading up to the games. The play-by-play account of the Olympics brings you back to the day you watched the pair's final. If you are looking for information on the scandal other than what was printed in newspapers, don't bother reading this book. Overall, it gives information that is hard to find elsewhere on the six skater's lives before and after the Olympics. I highly reccomend this book."
1,Boring,"For the second time Amazon.com has removed my book review that gave this book a low rating. Is this just to bring up the overall rating of the book? It certainly did that, when two reviews with one star were removed. Is this a trick to sell more copies? If Amazon.com does not want honest opinions, don't ask for customer reviews.I wrote two complete reviews of this book twice and I am fed up with Amazon.com. That's yet another reason to not buy the book.However, I will put my two cents here (yet again). The book has several factual inaccuracies which makes the analysis suspect. There are pages after pages of detailed descriptions of the skaters' lives, and speculations that make this more like a boring novel than a description of true events. I have heard and read all about the pairs event in Salt City Olympics. This book adds nothing to it, except for a few pictures. I would not waste my money on this book."
3,Too much backstory,"The book was not my cup of tea. I don't remember the events enough to care about any of the people covered in this book. The part I was most interested in was the scandal with the judging, not with the lovingly written back stories of each of the skaters. By the time the book got to the bit I was interested in I was bored and put the book aside."
5,"surprising, involving and lovely","I dare you to try to read this book in more than one sitting. Goodwin takes you deep into the minds and environments of all these skaters and their families, with all kinds of beautiful and telling details. International sports competitions like the Olympics really say volumes about who we are as cultures, and as individuals. Skating fans will love this book--but so will any sports fan curious about other cultures and human nature. An amazing read."
5,Perfect marks for this one!,"Being a fan of a sport such as figure skating, in a country where we don't have winter, is quite hard. I don't get to see as many competitions or information. It is refreshing to have internet, magazines, and a great book such as The Second Mark. It was so good that I couldn't put it down. Goodwin captured the escense of these six extraordinary athletes in a wonderful way. I recommend this book to everyone who loves a great story."
3,McCrea Shines in Colorful Biopic,"The sanitized life of Western legend William F. Cody receives a big-budget Technicolor production. Joel McCrea's splendid portrayal and William A. Wellman's expert direction redeem the melodramatic script. Cinematographer Leon Shamroy takes spectacular advantage of the Southern Utah scenery. ""Buffalo Bill"" (1944) has little relation to the truth, yet entertains in spirited Hollywood fashion."
5,Good Movie!,"Although historically inept, the movie has a fine empathetic performance by Joel McCrae, and a surpisingly sympathetic view of Native Americans. Well made, briliant color and epic scope it is a fine addition to anyone's Western collection. Just don't believe anything in it."
3,Harriet Tubman DVD,"I teach 4th grade, and I just finished reading a biography about Harriet Tubman to my students. I was hoping to follow up with a movie about her life. I was a little disappointed with the DVD Inquiring Heroes- Harriet Tubman. The movie itself was very short. Although the movie was advertised as being 45 minutes, the actual movie was only about 20 minutes. The DVD included a sing-along, which I didn't feel was as appropriate for 4th graders. The twenty minute movie was not in depth enough to really teach the children about the difficulties that Harriet Tubman faced. The movie didn't begin with Harriet's childhood. It began with her escaping from the plantation, so the children weren't able to understand from the movie the problems that led up to her wanting to escape. I would recommend looking for a better movie on Harriet Tubman if you teach older students."
4,A joyous read for enthusiasts.,"A great collection of automotive journalism written by a man who is now a hero of mine. This book goes into the depths of being a car-guy that outsiders don't understand. It helps the reader identify with a cause, and defines the feelings we all have for driving, working on, and just being involved with cars. Great read for anyone into cars, from the fast & furious import tuner crowd, to the shadetree mechanics, to the nascar couch fans. A wonderful book by a very good writer."
4,"A cool and entertaining commentary, as well as a memoir","The discussion of cars in this book was easy to understand, even to an amateur car fan like myself, and the stories themselves are extremely interesting. Although, after reading Peter Egan in Road and Track, it could have been funnier, but that might not correspond with the author's idea for the book."
3,Pretty good,"The anthology has a pretty good mix of techno music but its got a pretty good mix but its more laid back and mellow not really heavy club techno, more of a mellow chillin mix."
5,Incredible,"For 20 years, I've planned my vacations around visiting lighthouses. I thought I'd seen them all. Mr Siedel has turned up dozens, maybe even more than a hundred that I never knew existed. I must grudgingly pass my lighthouse wizard crown to him.The old photos he has dug up are amazing. If they were all that was here, this product would be an outstanding service to the lighthouse enthusiast. The amount of information here is astounding and yet it is presented in such an entertaining manner that it is never overwhelming. Whether you are just interested in looking at pretty pictures or you are a research scholar, I can highly recommend this CD. As for me, I've got to go plan some more vacations."
5,Great for kids.,"I like this because it's a show that both children and adults can watch. My six year old has very few programs that are tolerable to watch, but we all love Billy the Exterminator. She was also able to meet him a week or two ago and he's a super nice guy."
4,Useful book for practical work on vibration and acoustics,"I work as acoustic consultant, primarily with noise and vibration simulation.I recommend the book as it has helped me out on a few occasions where I needed to look into new things with which I had not previously worked. It is also useful when there is a need to reference matters you are familiar with, but want the detailed equations or the background assumptions restated.Having to solve practical problems, I especially appreciate that the author includes references to other work and, more importantly lists `rules of thumbs' that lead to sensible designs. Such recommendations have saved valuable time and money for me.So, the scope of the book goes beyond that of teaching. It is quite a useful book also for practical work."
4,'Sounds' like a winner,"This textbook was helpful in communicating the basic principles of engineering acoustics. Several errors, (k^2 missing in numerator of equation 6.14, page 109) but generally a good reference when coupled with good teaching. Includes around 8-10 problems after each chapter with solutions in the back."
4,It a Good CD !,"I bought this CD and thought it was Good. The songs are good,but, I was expecting better production though. Still it's a great CD if ya like traditional Country music."
3,Harmony wth horses,"Interesting book considering it was written over thirty years ago.Ray was one of the originals in ""Natural Horsemanship"". Althougha little hard to follow sometimes, he helped me more understandthe term ""feel"", used by the Dorrance brothers, and others. Agood addition to any collection."
1,"Not the best ""how to relate to your horse"" book available.","After seeing Mr. Hunt at a clinic, it was evident that he was an accomplished horseman who could get his point across very well to his subjects (the horses). A self-professed misanthrop, he was also verbally challenged and unable to clearly communicate what he was doing to the human attendees. I had hoped that his book would contain the secrets he was unable to express at his clinic. But, alas, it was equally disappointing."
5,Great book--with a different approach,"Ray Hunt was one of the best horsemen in recent history and his book reflects a lifetime of simple wisdom that characterized his life and way with horses. Not a long book, but one that should be read only a few pages or even few paragraphs at a time, so that the reader can absorb what he is saying. A must book for the serious horseman who really wants to understand horses."
3,Ray Hunt,"Ray Hunt was a phenomenal horseman, and I'm happy to have obtained a copy of this book. That said, it is rather poorly written. If you're a cowboy (or cowgirl) who's heard of the legendary Ray Hunt, you'll probably treasure his words (I do) and appreciate the man who spoke them. I think it would have been wonderful to meet Ray in person and learn from him, but since he's now gone, at least we have his philosophy to refer to in the training of our own horses. I think you have to know something about the ""old cowboys"" like Ray Hunt and the Dorrance brothers, and be attuned to the philosophy behind Natural Horsemanship, to really justify spending the money to buy this book."
3,I need to read it again,"I read this book through once. I think I need to read it again for it to sink in. It kind of rambles along as Ray Hunts streamof consciousness. I love the idea that it is the famous Ray Hunt, but I wish it had more practical every day advise I canuse when I'm spending time with my horse."
2,feeling the life flow thru him,"The book is full of abstract thought processes that don't explain much. The book was saved by the last chapter that was written by a student of one of his five day seminars. That chapter is called ""interpretation"" and it was greatly needed to make sense of what Mr. Hunt was trying to get across."
4,Good Ole' Boy!,"Hunt is one of a small handful of horsemen who were inspirational in the usage of ""natural horsemanship"" philosophies, so many today are now using. It is always a little different to read the words, when their methods are really only learned when they are ""felt"" through experience. Reading his words and thoughts are a wonderful insight to his powerful skills and knowledge. It is a small book, but worthy of the home library."
5,Carex Bed Buddy-back wrap,It is very easy to use - either by heating it in the microwave for a heat pack or by keeping it in the freezer for a cold pack. The heat or cold last long enough to help the pain. The size is perfect for my neck and shoulder.
2,You can do better,"This body wrap has an unpleasant and cheap outer fabric. Who knows what is in the inside....some little polymer beads, I believe. I have had far better wraps in the past. I will be sending this back. There should be more product info on line and on the box. I wouldn't have purchased it had I known it was entirely synthetic with a kind of brushed nylon fabric (the kind that catches the smallest rough area on a fingernail.) I am looking for a barley or rice filled wrap, as I have had in the past. They last a long time and seem to be a superior product."
2,Is it really 100% Natural filling? Smells like chemicals ...,"Purchased two of these - one as a gift and one for myself. The description claims 100% natural, but doesn't list what is in it. It really smelled funny - like chemicals. I've used similar products before and they usually smell like rice or buckwheat. This smelled more like lawn fertilizer.If you aren't sensitive to chemicals it does seem like a nice product. I like the construction and it seems durable, but the chemical smell is too strong for me. I am returning both of them and buying something else that lists all of its ingredients."
3,Disappointed,"I have been a user of the Original Bed Buddy Back Wrap for many years. This product was outstanding and is still in good condition.I purchased a second one for my sister several years ago and the product was identical to mine. Several months ago I purchased another Bed Buddy for my brother and a second one for my husband. This product is entirely different from the original one. It appears to be smaller and less flexible. The filler must have larger particles in it. It take much longer to heat up and is not as effective. I would not recommend this product. It should not be called the ""Original"" Bed Buddy as this is totally misleading."
2,Would be great if the quality of construction was better.,"This wrap was exactly what I was looking for in terms of size and application. Within two days of taking it out of the box, the stitching on one of the seams opened up and allowed the little heating media (rice) to spill out. I read two similar reviews posted in the last week saying the same thing. So there is definitely a quality issue with this product. I returned the item instead of replacing in-kind, because I am concerned about receiving the same poor quality item."
1,Waste of Money,"This wrap is poorly sewn together. We had only used this a couple of times before the seams started coming apart. If I wanted to sew, I would filled a tube sock with rice and seam the top. Poor quality."
5,Wonderful product,"Heats quicky in microwave. Forms to any part of the body. Although it's advertised as a ""back"" wrap, we have used it for everything except the back. Highly recommend."
4,"Carex Bed Buddy, Body Wrap",It does the job. Have serious neck issues and use it in the evening. I would like it better if it stayed warm longer.
3,somewhat helpful,"Not exactly what I had hoped for, as the heat is not retained for very long, and also the body wrap is quite heavy on the shoulders."
5,Bed Buddy for What Aches,I have been using Bed Buddy for several years now. I have been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and Arthiritis and use this product faithfully. It help relieve my pain and soothes my muscles. I would recommend this product to anyone with chronic pain
5,Love IT,Take it to bed with me. Use it on by back. Like the velcro to keep it on my knee or foot. Good for arthritis and it stays warm for a long time.
1,Horrible as cold pack,"I bought this because I wanted a cold pack to wrap around the back of my neck. I am very disappointed. I followed the instructions and left it in the freezer (for several days) and it just does not get cold - at all. I'm no expert, but I think it's because the material inside is very dry - it feels like crushed rice or sand or something like that. I have a cold pack with some sort of liquid in it and it get very cold. This does not."
4,very versitile,"I really like the versatility of the body wrap, i do wish it would be a little warmer, other than that it has been great!"
1,Smelly,"I do not know what has changed in Carex items, but OMG please change it back. These back wraps smell like bad seaweed. Can't even use them. I purchased one, and after gagging from the smell, I emailed the Carex company directly. They promptly got back to me, and even sent me a replacement free of charge. Unfortunately, it smells just as bad. I have another Bed Buddy product, the original cold/hot pack (long and white with two blue ropes on each end) and that smells yummy, like rice almost. But these back ones are not the same materiel inside or out. Horrible."
2,If only it didn't stink,"It's the first time using it, so I can hope the smell will dissipate with time, but I'm not hopeful. I don't understand why some of us seem to notice it (see other reviews) and others do not.It's a chemical smell, not of buckwheat, but of some kind of plastic or mad-made material. Is it toxic? I don't know, but I don't really want to find out! Amazon doesn't list where products are made, so I didn't realize until I got it that it's made in China. Given other issues there, I'm concerned enough about the origin of the ingredients to send this back.On the up side, it feels great on. I have some trigger points in my shoulder and this is helping reduce the pain from them while I type. Too bad I would have to wear a gas mask to enjoy the comfort."
2,poorly constructed and smells funny,"Within two uses the wrap started leaking rice from the poorly constructed seams. Also it really smells like fish when you heat it up in the microwave. Our microwave is new so it wasn't a smell that the wrap picked up, it was a smell that came from within it that got released with the heat. The heat makes your neck/back feel better, but the smell makes you nauseous. I wish I had not purchased this, my father had one for years and it was great, sadly the quality has clearly declined."
2,Odor is dealbreaker,"As other reviewers have stated, this has a fowl odor that won't quit. It fades a bit but after a year it still stinks. I've tried other items by this brand and they have a similar but milder odor- and I'm not referring to the ones that purport to have an intentional ""aroma"" added. I'm done with this brand."
1,not a good cold pack at all,"I bought this to use as a cold pack because I liked the form factor of it. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work very well. It is a good size, and it's lightweight compared to gel packs.I'm not sure how it is as a heat pack because I'm not interested in heat packs."
4,Wish it was warmer,"The old skinny little thing stayed hotter, longer, but this one covers a larger area and is good for my sore shoulder and my wife's neck."
2,Hard to get warm,"Have had other microwave heating pad and liked them but this odd shape makes it difficult to get warm even with 2 minutes. While the design fits around both knee and neck well, it is ineffective."
4,"Warm, moist heat for those aching muscles",This is just right for doctor ordered or self prescribed warm moist heat for those sore neck and shoulder muscles.
3,Bed Buddy,"The wrap is easy to use and heats up nicely in the microwave. However, it does not stay hot very long and it has a very peculiar, chemical-like smell to it which is bothersome."
1,Never Gets Cold,Bought this item to use as a cold pack but no matter how long you leave it in the freezer it NEVER gets cold. I have tried leaving it for as much as a week and still feels only a few degrees below room temp. What a waist of my money
2,fell apart after a year,"The moist heat from this unit is great, it's durability however is not.I replaced it after 2 years and 3 patches of duct tape *and* hot glueto prevent the stuffing from leaking out. I guess you get what youpay for. I'm happy to pay more to not have little stones leak outinto my bedsheets."
5,goes anywhere,goes anywhere and can be used everywhere-very versatile-works on all of my aches and pains. Have been ordering them for everyone-young and old
4,Bed Buddy,"I have owned one of the bed buddies before but it had seen better days. I was looking to replace it, but wasn't having any luck at any of our local drug stores or Walmart. So I went to the net to look it up and found that you carried them.I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and have also recently had arthoscopic knee surgery. The warmth helped to soothe the pain that I experience from both of these conditions. I love them.I bought extras to give away as gifts to family."
4,"Great, just wish it would stay cold longer!","Love the product. Great for your upper back. The only thing is I wish it would stay cold a little longer. It takes awhile to get it cold, and then it only stays cold for about 30 minutes. It has helped me though and not too expensive."
2,good concept - but just doesn't do it,"I purchased this for my husband who has a severe neck injury and needs to alternate cold and heat to help with the pain. When I saw this, I thought that was exactly what he needed. The concert is great and the design is great, but it doesn't hold the cold or heat long enough to really make a difference. It sits comfortably around the neck, but without the heat or cold, it might as well be a shawl."
1,Does not get cold,Does not get cold in the freezer. Says hot or cold. It does not get cold. I bought it for cold
3,Microwaqve heat pad,"I have had several different kinds and I do not like the velour material on this one. It makes my skin clammy. So I put it in a pillowcase, which helps. Cotton would be better."
3,Good Size but Weird Smell,Bought this for my husband who loves hot water bottles and or herbal wraps. He really likes this. Heats up fast but I don't think it retains the heat as well as others we have used in the past. It also has a very odd smell once it has been heated that you can faintly smell for days. Hard to describe smell but almost like burnt corn.
2,Not good at all,"I purchased this body wrap because I had heard it was one of the best but NOT TRUE for me at all.First of all it is so big that it barely fits in you microwave. Second of all, on the box it say to leave it in the microwave for one minutes and fifteen seconds but that doesn't work. The wrap doesn't feel warm at all in such a short time and once I left it for a longer time, it burned. i wouldn't recommend this product to anybody!"
3,Great for not being tied to a cord! But material melts...,"I loved it till the material between the folds melted...no matter how flat, how many times I flip it, and the mircowave is big with a carousel. (Less than 2 mins in mircowave). Also friend used it and melted a hole on the flat part, not sure how to ""patch it"". Currently I just put sports tape over it and hope for the best."
2,Works Great But Can't Get Rid of Odor,"We have been using Bed Buddies for years (both the back wrap and shoulder/neck version), and like them a lot. They really do deliver prolonged moist heat and relieve sore, tense muscles. The Velcro closures make them especially convenient to use.Our Bed Buddies were getting pretty tattered, so I ordered a couple of new ones. This time, though, they have a chemical smell that I can't remedy - I've tried airing them for days in the sun, storing them with baking soda sachets...nothing works. I don't want them in my microwave oven, where we cook food - so we continue to use the old ones, not the new ones. It's been a big disappointment."
2,"Horrible smell, not enough heat or enough time","I got this to use around my neck for tension headaches at the recommendation of my doctor. First of all it smells so bad it makes me nauseous. I don't know how to describe it, like maybe something rotted inside? I heat it for the maxmimum allowable time and it's just barely hot enough to relax my muscles at all. There isn't enough stuffing in it to actually hit all the areas I need it to hit though, and the areas where there is stuffing cool off within about 5 minutes. Useless. Would give it 1 star, but mine hasn't burned up.... yet."
1,Don't waste your money,"This bed buddy fits around the neck and over the shoulders very nicely, it heats evenly, and does a wonderful job. However, it only does the job a few times before the fabric starts melting a little at a time. I followed the directions and made sure the microwave was clean and dry, so I don't know why the fabric developed melted holes, but once the buckwheat started dribbling out it soon became worthless. They really should have used the same fabric as the original bed buddy. Then I would probably be giving it 5 stars instead of 1."
1,Terrible terrible!,"I bought this recently for my bad back. After heating in the microwave per the instructions, it retains heat for only about 20 minutes or so. Have to keep re-heating it.Furthermore, after about the 10th time using it -- and on a new day when it had not been used yet that day -- the outside material disintegrated in 2 places in the microwave, with the inner material falling out. Always heated for no longer than the instructions said to. I will never buy this again."
2,"Right size, right shape, WRONG SMELL!","I bought this to replace a similar microwaveable heat pad/wrap that I had from Sharper Image, which was ripping at the seems after many years of use. The Carex wrap heats quickly, holds heat well, and is the right size and shape. I use it for my shoulders (upper traps) and upper back. The channel stitching holds all of the heat-retaining filler in the appropriate places (no ""gravity slide""). Unfortunately, the thing stinks... bad. I'm not sure how to describe it... not quite chemical, but it's bad enough to cause me to find another replacement. It's unusable. I tried for a couple of weeks to see if it would get better, but it's actually getting worse with use. Can't recommend it unless you have no olfactory sense. Another smaller problem: the velcro tab is extremely rough."
3,Don't buy for cold therapy,"I bought this for my son who has fibromyalgia, for cold therapy. It does not get very cold even when left in the freezer for 24 hours. Then doesn't keep what cold it does have very long. To be fair, we have not used it for heat therapy. It may be wonderful for that. But don't buy if you need cold therapy."
3,Bed Buddy,"It's too heavy and the contents inside fall to the bottom of the stitched channels, so there is nothing around the neck area to produce heat. Might be good for shoulder pain though. I like other bed buddy products, but would recommend something smaller if you're looking for relief of neck pain. It worked pretty good for back pain though."
2,"Not cold enough, too short","Easy to use. tried using this product as ice pack. However, it's not cold enough, too short. Now looking for alternatives."
1,Horrible as a cold pack,"I purchased this specifically for cold use. I have never heated it up. However, even after days in the freezer it feels like your basic towel (if left in the freezer) and gets about as cold. Meaning, that it barely gets cold. So, my one star reflects the fact that they are selling this as a cold pack but it doesn't do the job. I just wish I still had the packaging so I could return it. (bought it locally)."
2,"Great for Heat, Terrible for Cold","This pack retains heat pretty well, but not cold. It doesn't have a great smell either. It does conform well and is large. Doesn't matter when you can't even get the pack cold enough to work. Look elsewhere."
3,Carex Bed Buddy Body Wrap,"Fits extremely well over the neck and shoulders, but doesn't stay hot near as long as the simple, first bed buddy. I wouldn't recommend it, they need to add more 'filler' to allow it to get as warm as the original bed buddy, then it would be 'perfect'!"
2,"If you're looking for a cold pack, look elsewhere","As noted by other reviewers, the body wrap does not work at all well as a cold pack, even though it is advertised as such. It has been in my freezer for over a week and I am wearing it now on one shoulder with an $8 Thermipaq I bought at the grocery store with an internal liquid/gel substance on the other. There is a noticeable difference. The grocery store liquid/gel pack is much cooler.I have not tried the body wrap as a heat pack but other reviews say it burns up or breaks down rather quickly. Not promising.Side tip: a physical therapist told me I could make my own ""ghetto ice pack"" with 1/3 cup vodka to 2 cups water in a Ziploc bag. Also works with rubbing alcohol."
1,USED !!!,"THIS ITEM WAS USED! It had hair, lint and dried up goo on it. Totally disgusting that they would send this out as new.I love Amazon, but this manufacturer or seller who would resend such a personal item in this condition is awful."
3,Great but doesn't stay warm long,"I agree with many of the other reviews. The original bed buddy stays warm much longer, as do most of my herbal packs. I think this one doesn't do as well because of the separate compartments. That makes for a smaller volume with more ""wall"" space and faster heat loss. Too bad because it sits really nicely on the neck and shoulders. I've found some help with this by putting a light fleece blanket folded on top of it, to help stop heat loss."
2,Needed more,"Terrible acting for the most part. Powers and such were awesome, and i guess good for an independent film with not much of a budget. Needed to use, make, or have different sets for this movie to have its own story setting. Wasn't sure who were the bad guys for the most part. Couldn't hear much of the dialogue. Overall it was cool, unique, but needed more before it was actually finished. I fast forwarded for the most part.Hope that the next film, which is a Superman Fan Film, will be much better..."
1,doesn't exist,"I've tried ordering this 3 times, then proceeded to check London Elektricity's website and there's no mention of this existing. Do Not Order."
2,Too small,"The earplugs were soft and flexible, which I liked, but they were too small and didn't block out noise as well as I would like."
2,Muffs are better,"Although they're easier to store and handle than muffs - you can put them in your pocket - they're too flimsy for rugged use. I know you're asking, ""What did I expect for five bucks?"" But after only a few trips, the tips of the plug tore and I had to shove the shoestrings tips down into the plug itself. Ironically, they now block sound better, but you have the tiniest of panic attacks pulling the plugs out of your ears when the ride is over. Break the piggy bank and buy the muffs instead. They look cooler and protect better."
1,NON-USABLE,"THESE EARPLUGS ARE 'NON-USABLE' AS THEY ARE SO SOFT, THEY WILL NOT GO INTO THE EAR CANAL. COMPLETLY USELESS."
1,Don't waste your money on these. Non functionable.,I should have bought another type as these didn't work well for me in that they wouldn't stay in place and didn't offer enough noise protection.
3,Soft Plugs,These work great as far as the sound is concerned but the cord is not glued into the plug and came out on the first pull when out shooting.
2,not for my ears,"bought the item, I'm sure it would work for others but they don't seem to fit in my ears.I went with a ear muff system instead.seller was fantastic, wish the product worked for me :("
2,Poor conformity,"These earplugs look and feel like gummy bears. Subsequently, don't deform as much or as well as other designs such as foam plugs. Depending on your ear, these may or may not suit you.I tested these while I was vacuuming and felt numbness around my ears when I was done. I never had that problem with my other reusable earplugs, which use strips of thin plastic to conform to my ear. I never felt numbness with foam earplugs either, which you would never expect from a foam design anyway.Sound protection was adequate once I found a ""proper fit"", but the numbness seemed like my body's way of telling me to stop using these earplugs. Hence, I am only using them for short periods when I have nothing else available.Bear in mind that I will use these only because I have them. I would not buy them anymore nor recommend this design."
1,READ REVIEW FIRST!!!,dont buy this if you using it for target shooting its not effective at all!!! it will only hurt your ear than protecting it... this snugplug is ok for other puposes
2,not great,"These are for the very small ear canal people out there. The material is soft and comfortable and great. If it were just a little bigger, i would love them"
3,Small not so snug,If these plugs fit your ear canal they're probably fine however:1) They're small.2) The stethoscope effect is pronounced because the cord has rough texture.3) Even if they seem to fit they will gap if you lean the right (wrong) way.
2,Radians earplugs,"The quality is not great, but what do you expect for something that is priced so low. They should last a season of shooting, and are a good backup to keep in your case."
2,are you a shooter? keep looking,"I don't know how these are supposed to have an NR rating of 28. They don't fit well in my ears. The flange on them is too small to make these fit any but the smallest ears. And mine are fairly small. If you shoot guns and are looking for a good set of ear plugs, these are not the plugs you're looking for."
2,Not so great,"I got these for motorcycle riding to cut the wind noise. I chose these as a filler item for free shipping. I like the fact that they are reusable, but they do a poor job of reducing noise compared to the disposable foam ear plugs. I don't intend to use them."
3,Good basic protection,"I bought these to protect against the noise of a two-stroke snowmobile, a task they performed adequately. I wouldn't say they were the best because the disposable expanding foam earplugs work better I think. The best thing about these is that they're easily cleaned being that they're made from silicone. They're somewhat difficult (as earplugs go) to get a good fit with. The cord (which is basically a shoestring) comes out of the plug pretty easily so you need to be careful that you don't snag it on something. Overall though, for the price, they're okay."
1,Like being ear raped by tiny little elves!,It honestly feels like your sticking tiny dildos in your ears. It's seriously disturbing.Plus they don't work. There about as effective as wearing a stocking cap. After three shots from a 30-06 and three shots from a .243 I gave up and went back to my cheap foam earplugs.
1,Very dissatisfied.,"This item was not properly described. It is intended for automotive use only, but the description did not state that. I wanted something for use with 110 volts AC. As a result, I had to return it and eat the cost of shipping both ways."
4,JJ's Cool Guitar can Soothe,"I used to see JJ at PB Scott's Music Hall in Blowing Rock, NC back in the late 70's. This live CD took me back to those shows-his guitar sound is right on-round, rolling and pure JJ. I was wondering why they didn't mix the disc to sound like one show, even though they are tunes from different shows from the early 90's. Hearing JJ's sound you can really get his influence on Clapton and Knopler-what a true pioneer he is with his song-writing and subtle zen guitar.You will like this disc in the car, especially Call Me the Breeze!"
3,The fade outs between each track kill the flow,"It's supposed to be a LIVE recording, not a studio recording. Even though the tracks come from different shows, they could have easily synched the tracks together. The songs and playing are pure J.J. Cale, laidback and more laidback, very nice. The production leaves a lot to be desired though."
3,"Decent set, but not a great recording.","As others have said in their reviews, this Live recording doesn't have very good sound and the fading between tracks IS annoying. If you like J.J. Cale already, you'll enjoy the collection of songs on this album. If you're new to this artist however, you might want to try one of his studio albums like 'Travelog'."
2,What does it add?,"I have a lot of J. J. Cale on vinyl, and I really like some of it, but the sound samples here give the impression that someone has stood this cat up on stage and tried to wring another buck or two from a legend whose time is past. I was told I would rate this 4 stars because I bought a John Ussery CD and some Little Feat stuff, but the Ussery this is straight blues and the Feat is replacement for some worn-out vinyl. It makes me feel good that artificial intelligence is still a heartbeat behind my own sad fifty-year-old taste in music. No arguing with any other real person's taste, but I haven't been convinced to buy this one. I still think the world of J.J. Cale."
1,Would the real JJ please ...,"... stand up and deliver, cause this guy here is a ... .Someone wrote that the first four trax are really the best and worth buying the CD. No. The fist two trax are ok, and whyx buy a CD with only two good trax on it?The sound is mostly awful (hey, Cale, we live in 2002, not 1950). Cocaine is not worth the name any more, cause it doesn't take you anywhere. Call me the breeze is not even that, and forget the rest.What made Cale's CDs worth listening is the interplay of the musicians and some - some! - good songwriting. Since there is no interplay, and the songs are performed in 'I wish I was somewhere else' fashion - don't buy this.The fact that there are only 6 reviews shows the audience this guy must have nowadays, and rightly so."
3,Need More Inspiration,"""Utilities"" moved me, some what. Although whenever I saw Zabiela live, he just bring out the sound 10 times better. Zabiela, man, you're a talented DJ fo sho. How about starting more compilations of your ""mixed live"" sessions. Do IT!!+ Strong Tracks +* This Is Sick... Truly a sick track - LUV IT!!* Rykketid* At the Rave* Gyromancer... Take that! Crystal Method"
1,Bitterly Disappointing.,"In July 2005 i went to see Sasha & Digweed in Cork, Ireland. James Zabiela was playing before them so i decided to go have a look. He truly blew me away, his mixing and enthusiasm, and most importantly, song content was top class, he was even better than Sasha & Digweed and that's saying a lot.So i bought this album on the back of that performance. The album has mixing skills but that's it!!!. The songs are rubbish. There's not even one stand out track on either CD. Don't even bother with CD one - it's a complete write-off consisting of soulless electro and is just plain irritating.CD 2 only gets going at about song five - but is still way below average. There was talk that James Zabiela would be the next Sasha. On the back of this effort - i don't think so. Buy at your peril. James, stick to the gigs."
3,WeatherTech 440622 Black Extreme Duty Rear Floor Liner,i thought this would be more heavy duty and i thought it was supposed to be a snug fit. i had husky's before on my old truck and it was thicker and higher side walls. i haven't received the front ones but ill see how that turns out.
5,"I Never Write Reviews, But....","...this time I felt the need. Of all the books I read after my sweet black cat, Flash!, died a year and a half ago, this one meant the most. Ever since my sweet boy passed away at the ripe old age of 11 (old for a cat with FIV, I was told), I searched for a book like this one...someone who feels as I do, and Samantha Mooney captures this. My heart aches when I think of Christmas without him...spring without him...he was alive just a little while ago...where did he go? What happened to him? Ms. Mooney seems to be the only writer that shares these thoughts with me, and so this book helped me tremendously. If you're mourning a loss as deep as ours, please don't hesitate...treat yourself to this book."
5,Wonderful and Bitter-sweet,"Bitter-sweet and wonderfulIf you can not tolerate an animal in pain or the loss of a beloved pet do not read this book. HOWEVER, among the sorrow there is so much joy the book is hard to put down and took less then two days to read because it is a page-turner. Written in pleasant conversational tone the author brought me into the story, I felt as if I was watching everything first-hand. So many lives to fall in love with, so many celebrations to cheer and inevitably loss of life to cry and grieve over. Clear crisp writing of life the way it is without being morbid or gory in describing each story. A book I will add to my personal library of ""those never to give away.""I love this book...."
5,Get This Book!,"If you are a pet owner/lover get this book. It is informative, funny, and moving. Gives one a new perspective on life and death and the value of a certain kind of friendship that only an animal can bring to your life. Highly recommended. Wonder what ever became of the author and why she has not written more books?"
4,sad but true stories of the end of life for our wonderful pets,I can say I knew this would be sad.....but having had to put down some of my precious pets over the years would want to be with them as they passed over the rainbow bridge so I sat with them until the end so they would not be alone. I anguishes after each loss but was glad I could be a part of their going on into a new life.
3,A Snowflake In My Hand Book Review,"Hmm, I don't think I can even come up with 20 words to review this product?Book was okay, but started out way too slow for my tastes. The two (or more?) cats that died in the book was sad reading I do admit, but they had better lives than a lot of the stray cats you see on the street that die of cat diseases without the benefit of veterinary intervention. Maybe I'm a bit cynical here, but I don't think it was worth a lot of the five star reviews I saw the book had when I first decided to purchase it. I'm sure other readers would disagree with me here though, and would thoroughly enjoy reading the book themselves.Nonetheless, Samantha Mooney is a good hearted woman."
4,A real tear jerker,"This is a nice book for people with pets. I have three Feline Leukemia positive cats that live with me, so I was very interested in this book. It really hit home."
4,Good stopping power...but awful brake dust and noise.,"I have been running R4-S pads on my E36 M3 for about two years now. I am a ""spirited"" driver and also do about 6 track days a year. I find the R4-S pads to be a good choice for good daily driving and occasional track use. I haven't experienced brake fade on the track and I do brake late and hard. The only complaint (for street use) is that these pads tend to be a bit noisy and leave a lot of brake dust (especially on the fronts..)Overall I am pretty happy running these on my daily driver."
3,Pretty Good.,"This lens is cool to work with, it is a nice lens for shooters on a budget. Of course if you have the money then by all means spend it. The 2X adapter is GARBAGE. I could not get decent results with it no matter what I did so save the little extra $$ and skip that addition."
1,Not worth the money.,"I bought this lens because I have started getting into nature photography, particularly watching some nesting Swainson's Hawks. According to the pictures, this lens should get me right up to their nest. Well, it did get me a little closer, but nothing like the picture showed, and then when I put the pictures on my computer, all of the pictures were so overexposed you couldn't see what you were looking at. Don't waste your money on this lens."
5,BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was the best book ever written. It belongs in the library with Shakespere, Dr. Seuss, JK Roling, Michael Crighton and Charles Frasier. I have visited the Battle of Carthage 67 times and all facts in this story are entirely accurate. As for the negative reviewer, if he is still a virgin, he could be hooked up with Emily Petersen. That woman will fix him up. Back to the book, it is very well written and describes all aspects of the battle in excellent detail. Don't let this strange review thwart your desire to read this book... I have several schizophrenic relatives... and I'm not very good at speling. Here in Newberg we aint learned to write good. As Bob Cydell once said, ""What would you say you do here?"" I will end on that note, goodnight, and farewell."
4,Lowest price I found!,This item was out of stock but it was worth the wait because the low price it was going for.
3,Not very helpful,"I was looking for greater detail and possibly more pictures. This book just didn't impress me at all and actually I ended up donating it. I am a beginner at toe reading and expected more explanation. To me, it was simply a disappointment."
1,not for beginners,"I was excited to get the book, unfortunately it is addressed to advanced modelers, and the Glossery was chinese for beginners, plus the fact he had no place for nautical explanation of his descriptions,I will add most of the jigs he referred to are not available. It could be I am at fault for ordering and possible it should have mentioned it is only for advanced modelers."
3,"Good, but not what it advertises","An interesting book covering most aspects of planking of solid, bulkhead and frame models. It really only brushes over each subject. What it really needs is a step by step example, be it photos or diagrams, as I am yet to find an author that really does it well. You purchace a book on techniques, you expect it to be step by step, with demonstrations, not generalisations.It has good photos of wonderfully made models, but it is about planking, not showcasing a mate's work. It is a difficult subject, that could have been done so much better. Why not show differing clamps, homemade and commerical, the ways to bend the planks not a paragraph of description, demonstrate how to do the dowels, not a paragraph, that is why people buy these books, to learn."
1,Maybe okay if you already know all this stuff!,"NOT presented in a truly orderly and logical manner. Nice pictures of models done by members of a certain Club, but does not adequately teach planking from scratch. Many terms are NEVER defined and there is no rigorous process defined; like I said, it's okay, IF you already know most of this stuff and just want the author's take/recommendations on which of a bunch of ways to go. Will confuse a novice into tears (I know it did me, and I've built a couple of models already)."
2,Good information poorly organized,"Mr. Dressel is obviously a very experienced builder, and there is a great deal of information in the book, but it the way it is presented makes it very difficult to absorb.The organization of the material made for very frustrating reading. The planking techniques indicated in the title are scattered throughout the book in various sections, and are often separated by unrelated (but interesting) material.Nautical component terminology (like ""wing transom"" and ""fashion pieces"") should be clarified (preferrably by illustration) before or at least at the same time they are used in the text.The ""how to"" explanations would be much improved by diagrams, photos or drawings with step by step procedures, rather than the often vague descriptions provided.Overall, the reader must expend a great deal of effort to glean the information from the book."
1,"Rambling, Disorganized","This book is not useful. While the author maybe a good ship modeler, he does not know how to explain it.It is disorganized and poorly written."
1,I would not buy this book again,"Lots of [bad] pictures.A stuffy comment about ""I have never had to personally use stealers""This guy may really be that good but the rest of us don't need to hear about it.Final comment: I kept the book but have been thinking about throuwing it in the recycling bin. It is NOT GOOD for beginners...or much of anybody else."
4,Vendetta Rad,"I've been a fan of this band for a while, but never bought anything they put out. I saw this on sale, and figured I'd give it a swing, and if it sucked, no biggie. Well, it certainly doesn't suck by any stretch of the definition.While not quite as hard as their earlier output, this is actually a very good introduction EP, because it covers a wide array of what Vendetta Red is capable of. If you like sing-along chorus' AND throat shredding vocals, check these guys out. Good, rubber basslines, angular guitar riffs, and some super tight drumming. 8/10."
4,Long time,"I have always like Milira. I had been searching for a long time to find this album. When I saw it on Amazon, I jumped at it. I just wonder where she is now. ""Go Outside In The Rain"" is the ultimate!"
5,Superb,"I can't think of a single bad thing to say about this book. The writing is clear, the examples numerous and interesting, and topics are covered thoroughly. There are exercises of various levels of difficulty. Very suitable for self study."
2,Disappointing,"I had expected the sound of a street corner Salvation Army band; brass, close miked, pure, basic. This recording has a produced, orchestral sound, recorded in a large hall. The picture on the CD jacket is not what you hear on the CD."
2,Snore,The book did not keep me interested and I ended up giving it to goodwill while only 1/4 of the way through.
2,Not impressed at all...,"This book barely scratches the surface when it comes to manipulation. This book is kindergarten compared to the book ""Mind Manipulation: Ancient and Modern Ninja Techniques by Haha Lung."" Buy this one instead if you want to get right down to the nitty gritty on mind manipulation."
4,In Sheeps Clothing,"It was understandable and easy to read, but I wish it were more in-depth. I thought it was a little on the light side. The author laid out good examples of the subject matter and it was a good read, but I just expected more."
5,Great book--must read,"This is a great book. He describes my step-mother's behavior with frightening accuracy, and he describes me perfectly as her ideal dance partner. Not anymore! A must read for anyone dealing with a manipulator in their life!"
5,excellent book,Very easy to read with good insight into manipulative people. Great tips for dealing with them. Invaluable book to have
4,Invaluable,A whole new way of seeing family members and getting a better understanding of how to better work with them. A must for anyone who has to deal with manipulators.
2,Not as informative,I loved the cover and title. Cant say it was informative. I've read more concise and informative books. Doesn't offer much dealing/coping mechanisms. We read to understand and and hopefully have insight/ideas/suggestions to heal. I returned this book because it neither served as a reference nor would i even read it a second time.
3,In Sheep's Clothing has no follow through,"In Sheeps Clothing is a very entertaining book that goes into depth into the mind of difficult and manipulative people. The anecdotes are instructive and easy to read. However, the main reason for this book is to help someone deal with these type of people. However,three fourths of the book is dedicated to the difficult people leaving a scant on fourth to the coping skills necessary to deal with them. As a result, the last part of the book reads more like a general overview rather than teaching actual skills."
5,I knew I wasn't imagining it.,"This book gives clear advice on how to stop being manipulated by malicious people who go to great lengths to appear helpful and empathetic. Not only does Simon give us words to describe what we experience (it's hard to explain to others the evil nature of someone who is so pleasant), he tells us what to do about it. This book brings validation and relief to its readers."
3,"Too simple, but worth reading","It may be that it is very concice (compressed), but I must confess I was not very impressed after the first read off this book.Unless you are extremely naiv, you probably know most off it's content. Still it has a value to read it so as to not fall in the temptation off naivety and romantisism.What I expected was more examples of manipulation and deeper psycological reasons as to why they work.The most important thing I have concluded so far is the extreme importance of knowing your own weakneses and desires.Manipulation is essentialy knowing another persons weakneses and desires and exploit them. If you don't know them yourself you are the perfect victim."
3,A good start,"This book describes the manipulative personality quite well, however, I found it rather superficial compared to Snakes in Suits or Who is Pulling Your Strings."
4,Eye-opening,"I think this book discusses an important topic but needs to be updated and elaborated on. It gets a little windy in certain sections that really don't need it but overall, it does bring to light some very interesting points. If you work with manipulative people this isnt quite meant for you so much. It is meant more for people who are in relationships with people who covertly aggress as the book describes it."
5,One of the best books I read this year.,This book can be understood by all. Because we have all seen this behaviour in people. Helped me rid of people that were draining me.Helped me see my own ways of using subtle aggression as well as others.
5,In Sheep's Clothing,"The author expertly describes the covert-aggressive techniques used by this manipulative type. It can be read in a short time, and the author uses language lay-readers can understand. Reading the book is an eye opener, to be sure. While not being a lengthy volume, the author masterfully exposes the true character beneath the sweet, wooly cloak we see. If you want to see, and if you want to understand why you might feel confused, sad, or angry at the ""sheep"" in your life, this book will ""disrobe"" the character so that your perception is clear. I highly recommend this book."
4,In Sheep's Clothing,It's great to read about the different types of manipulators and feel encouraged to take a position in my own life.
5,Excellent Information,"Great book! Great advice on how to deal with these types of people. Not only does it explain the behavior of manipulative people, but it offers advice on how to change your own behavior to combat the impact those kinds of people have on you."
1,More Trash,"I was hoping that this book would provide me with some insight into how individuals are actually affected by war, but this book is nothing more than a forum for the author to express his blatent anti-war opinions. As a psychologist myself, I found this book to contain no real psychology, and the author's statements and accusations were not bolstered by any solid research. If you are interested in reading about the true psychology of war, I would not recommend this book."
3,Not 5 stars,"I bought this book since the prior reviewer gave it 5 stars.... Well, I wasn't as impressed as the other person. It wasn't a bad book & did have a good storyline/ending. The problem I had was the history of the older magician was confusing. Also, I would have liked more history regarding the older magician's wife. I thought she was the most interesting character other than than the older magician. Basically, this book could have been better IMO & wasn't a 5 star read.... I ended up donating my copy to local library...."
3,not so magical...,"The book was pretty predictable and unimpressive. What was actually intriguing was left under-explored, such as the history behind the older magician. The book was billed as a modern update on ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" yet it failed to actually update anything-- there was no addition or twist on the original story-- resulting in a predictable, though competently written story. It wasn't bad, but it definitely could have been better."
3,Rosetta Stone- ??,"I LOVE the product when it works!! I installed it on my personal computer and it worked for a few weeks then all of a sudden--- wouldn't work anymore! I emailed Rosetta Stone tech support --- in the mean time installed on my work computie, and it works. I have to have it on my home computer though! Tech support finally emailed back wanting to know if I had resolved the problem and if not to fill in this questionaire--- now a month later STILL NOTHING!! SO Basically their tech support is worthless and to pay this much for software you would think you could get tech support! I need to buy another language now but worried I may never get the support to have it on my private computer! :o("
1,Do not waste your money,"I bought this product after reading the great reviews in Amazon and I can say that it was the worst buy of my entire adult life. The software is booooring and repetitive. It was hard to stay awake during the study. Some of the sentences were useless (The boy is under the airplane). This pattern continued for the duration of the course up to the advanced levels. It is impossible to understand the German grammar from these silly exercises.I have checked other softwares to learn German. They all require a lot of motivation and discipline, but Tell me more and Instant Immersion are much much better than Rosetta and at a better price. Check the demos for yourself and read reviews on language softwares and you see that Rosetta is never rated as the best (Tell me more usually is)."
4,works as advertised,"Have used this mostly when traveling. It can be confused in airports, for example, where there is more than one wireless network in operation. Next time I would purchase a more expensive device that can sort signals and networks. At home it is useful to help quickly determine if a network problem is caused by a wireless network failure or by the Internet Service Provider. I recommend purchasing a more sophisticated version of this device."
3,Okay although has a major flaw,Does a good job detecting networks although doesn't indicate whether they are secured or open.
3,Pleasing array of Stars,"What impressed me most about this CD is the wide array of stars that appear on it. What did not impress me however is the fact that it's out-of-print & not easily available. But if you're lucky then both listeners of pop/jazz will find this effort by Mandoki as a novel one. Mandoki heads the wagon wheel on vocals & percussion supported by Ian Anderson, Jack Bruce, Nik Kershaw, Al Di Meola, Steve Lukather, Steve Khan, Anthony Jackson, Brecker Brothers & many more. The best track is track no2.which features Chaka Khan."
2,"Borrow it from a friend, don't waste your money on it","The CD sounds like it was recorded in a karaoke bar. This artist has a unique voice but her lyrics get overshadowed by the other instruments. Once in a while she manages to hit the right notes but I find her CD rather annoying and insulting. Out of all the songs on her CD I'd have to say Iceberg was the best, at the risk of sounding frugal I'd have to say buying a CD for one song would be a waste of money. Best stay away from this CD, buying it would be like throwing your money out the window."
2,Historic but dissapointing first...,"While this Duck book is significant as not only the first 'original' Donald Duck comic-book but also as the first Duck work by Carl Barks (he did not write it and drew only part of it) it is a dissapointing read, especially when compared with the far better Donald Duck or Uncle Scrooge books which followed. Adapted from an unproduced Disney animated film, the pacing is slow and the story, unexciting and uninvolving. I found it very tedious to get through. Better to pick this one up after you've read the good stuff (especially try the Uncle Scrooge story ""Back to the Klondike"" to see what I mean.)"
4,"Great Value, solid build quality",This lens compares very close to my Canon 17-40mm f4L lens. This lens does not have HSM (Canon equivalent of USM) so it is slightly noisy yet it focuses pretty fast except in low light conditions. Accessory flash is a must if you are using indoor low light shots.Even though it says 15-30mm actual coverage is only 16mm at the wide end. I was a little dissappointed because I bought this lens thinking I would get 15mm because I own 17-40mm. I have not gained much in the wide side.I paid less than half the price of Canon for this lens. This lens feel very solid.Sharpness and color saturation is superb.
2,Not my first choice...,this product goes through batteries quickly and the vibration is very loud to the point of distraction.
2,disappointing,"The horse is the usual Breyer quality, but the saddle, bridle & rider's clothes look really cheap. They definitely don't look like they will hold up to being played with, and they certainly aren't collector quality. Definitely not worth the high $. So does anyone know if buying the accessories and riders separately is any better quality?"
1,Dont believe the hype,"Bought the album based on the quality of the single ""Crazy"" which is a great song. Was totally underwhelmed by the rest of the Album which is mediocre at best. Dont believe the hype."
1,don't be fooled,"Don't buy this album if you're expecting more songs similar to Crazy. I can't understand how you can be so good and so bad at the same time. This is a perfect example of why you listen to an album before you buy it. What a waste of talent. I look forward to good things to come, however."
3,the current rave,"this album is gemerally a crowd pleaser but will not stand the test of time to become a great LP. good violent femmes cover, fun, upbeat mix of electronica, hip hop, and rock. you'll likely listen to this for about 3 mos and then probably sparingly....."
3,I hate when record companies do this,"It is so annoying when record companies re-release cds with bonus material and/or dvd. It is just a sneaky way to get more money. I already own the cd and the Vinyl LP record edition of this album (That was a gift). I shouldn't have to buy the same album twice. Now, If I didn't already own this album, then this version would be worth the purchase. The music alone deserves a 5 star rating. What the record companies need to do with this bonus material is release it with the first release, save it for the next album, or release it by itself at a lower cost."
5,Most Original Album of 2006,"As you can tell by most of the reviews for this album, either people love it or it's not for them.I heard and loved ""Crazy"" on the radio (like everyone else in the world...) but while previewing each track on Amazon I wasn't captivated. However, I broke down and bought the album and I am so glad that I did. The album is in my opinion the most creative album of 2006. The sound is very urban/modern --- creative hip hop without all of the foul language and repetitive beats.I rarely give any product 5 stars on Amazon, but this one certainly deserves it."
4,What an album should be,"Cee Lo was always a creative force starting with the Dungeon Family, then moved as a solo artist. This is his most successful work to date under an alter ego with Danger Mouse. This album is fun & refeshing each time you listen to it, its also not a negative album at all."
3,so so,"crazy is obviously a great song. the rest of the cd is okay, but i don't really listen to it much."
5,I love this CD,"I have been looking for a new style of music, and in St. Elsewhere's Psychadelic Soul, I think I found it. For the most part this CD is unbelievably entertaining, and I love cruising to this CD. It's a great CD."
2,not a fan,"i bought this based on the reviews, thinking that i was going to like it. maybe i need to give it a good listen, but i've tried twice and i just can't get into it."
4,"Gnarls Barkley, St. Elsewhere",A fresh take on 70's funk...with the added suprise of both gospel and rap tracks included on one CD!
3,mixed,"rap, reggae, gospel...quite a variety of sounds, but no unique ""sound"" to define the group's style. Not very impressed."
4,A lot of filler songs,"I would give it three stars, if I didn't like at least one of the songs on the CD so much."
2,two good songs,"Ok, maybe I'm getting old (I resisted saying maybe I'm crazy) but there are only 2 good songs on this CD. Go thou to I-tunes."
3,They Say I'm CRAAAAYYYZZAAAAYYY!,"Cee-Lo Green The Soul Machine returns with a collaboration album with producer Danger Mouse under the moniker Gnarls Barkley. If people have kept up with CeeLo Green they would know that his solo projects aren't for everyone and this release definitely isn't for everyone. Heck it aint even for me. It's not an album that could be classified so people who like different genres may like different aspects of the album. Personally, I like a couple of the songs on here and the rest I skip but the songs I like, I REALLY like. The songs I like are CRAZY, WHO CARES, TRANSFORMER, and ONLINE. But I could see how folks could like the rest of the album if they like that type. Still Crazy is the best thang smokin (get that Young Dro!) on this album and rightfully so...it's very great song. 3 stars."
3,Catchy,"This one is OK. Some of the songs we love, some of them we hate. It has to grow on you a bit, so give it a few tries before putting it on the shelf."
3,A coupe of real grab ya songs,"One or two real grab ya songs - otherwise, maybe your taste, maybe not.... but definately not up to par with the hit songs. Just download the good couple of songs and skip the CD."
5,"""Odelay"" for the New Millenium","WOW! I haven't enjoyed a CD this much in 10 YEARS... since the afore-mentioned Beck. DJ Danger Mouse does it again! I couldn't believe it the first time I heard this CD.Think 60's Motown meets Sir Mouse... a bit Al Green, Miracles, Temptations, Spinners and even Dionne Warwick with an amazing backbeat and a lyrical darkside. Funky, soulful R"
3,Frenzied beats that do not disrupt the music's natural flow. Huh?,"If you are looking for songs as catchy as Crazy you won't find them here. It is one of the best uptempo songs I've heard from a male vocalist in a year or so and the most straightforward track on the album. The other tracks are too disjointed for my taste; like the beatles mixed w/ funkadelic, and a bit of rock -n- roll, played by a schizophrenic DJ. (Maybe this CD should come with a dime bag.) To his credit, when I saw Ce-lo being interviewed witht the Gmob a while back he seemed very humble. It would make a nice soundtrack and has ""grow on you"" potential."
1,"Fantastic Album, Horrible Encoding","I adore this album, and purchased the MP3 album to replace a lost CD from Amazon. The encodings are horrible, full of crackle and hiss in all but the most quiet tracks. It appears that the encoding was done from a CD with a diminished dynamic range, which was compounded by the loss of quality inherent in MP3 encoding.In short? Buy the CD, and rip it yourself unless you are mostly deaf."
4,St. Elsewhere by Gnarls Barkley,"It's a CD I bought for a friend and they like it very much. I'm 63 now and DO love the current ""good"" songs the youngsters listen to these days...CB isn't my total cup of tea, however, but that's just me, an old fart, saying what he thinks...lol"
3,Kinda disappointed,"Few weeks ago I saw their concert in London on HDnet. I was blown away. Some of the best soul,funk,r&b; I've ever heard. They were playing real instruments.I was disappointed after listening studio versions of both albums. Sounds like any other hip hop or whatever they call this new music."
5,Where the Hell is MF doom,this album is so good who ever said crazy is the only good song must be into pop and backstreet boys.i think if u are gonna write a review u should leave it for us musical Connoisseur.Favorite songs gogo gadget and just a thought. The rest are amazing to just not as good as those. Where was doom. the only thing this lacked was some sick rhymes i thought since dangerdoom had benzibox we would hear another collabDangermouse blows me away again if your looking for a great album dangermouse produced a band called pelican city check out rhode island
1,I am crazy,"I soooooo loved that song ""crazy"" that I just had to have this cd and was so disappointed in their non-compliance with their brilliance that I am ready to give it away. My favorite song is not more than three minutes and the orgasm is over before you know it and some sludge of a song comes before and after. His brilliant vocals are only shown in the coveted song and the rest is some hip-hop that I don't connect with at all. I am so mad at their collaborators as to their ignorance in what hooked us in the first place. Give me more ""crazy"" sounds and I will be satisfied."
2,"Good at first, then...","Pretty much all the songs on this album attracted me at first because of their catchy beat, but after actually listening to the songs a couple times I just became fairly annoyed and then aggravated to hear these songs. If I never hear Crazy again on the radio, you won't catch me shedding any tears."
2,average&#65533; a good Charles barkley reference,"Danger Mouse is good producer&Cee-Lo always comes out of Left Field which would make this a interesting Colab,but aside from ""Crazy: nothing else rivals that Mesh up.things get bogged down&in a hurry.I think a EP would have been in order as to a full 14 tracks because after a while this Album becomes like a Novelty as to being what it should have been&that is a Interesting hook up."
4,Pretty Darned Good,"With the exception of three songs on the CD, it is pretty darned good. I don't care for Feng Shui, Transformer or Go Go Gadget Gospel. Of course, Crazy is the best song above all."
5,Crazy,"Bought this cd based on the song ""Crazy,"" and was pleasantly surprised to learn whole album is just as creative and innovative as that song. A plus- their cover of the Violent Femmes song. I think is the new direction for American music."
5,"This album is ""Crazy""!!!!!","This album is one of the most unique collaborations I ever heard. Danger Mouses amazing and eclectic beats combined with Cee-los soul-grabbing voice has captured me in this new genre of music. It is a mix of funk, soul, and rock. It is definitely an album for those who are tired of the same ol stuff. The first single, ""Crazy"", is just what it says. My favorite songs on the album are Crazy and Smiley Faces. Cee-lo has always been one of the most soulful voices in Hip Hop to me. From his days in Goodie Mob (Soul Food) to his solo albums (Cee-lo Green and His Imperfections Cee-lo Green is the Soul Machine), I have found that Cee-lo is always Cee-lo. This album sounds like the evolution of his solo albums. I am always impressed when artists go against the norm. Though I am not familiar with any of Danger Mouses work, this album makes me want to buy something else from him. The album is absolutely worth the money you pay for it."
2,Crazy...its a one track wonder,"Got the CD, listened once, shelved it. Crazy is a great song, but the rest of the album falls flat. Definitely try to get a careful listen before you buy."
5,This made 2006 worthwhile!,"Thank god this CD (or album, as some prefer) came out last year\summer.It was the only thing worth listening to.These guys are unbelievable.Prince has been replaced."
4,ST. ELSEWHERE REVIEW,I thought it was great. These two groups blended together very well for this CD. A couple of the songs by Gnarles Barkley just blew me away.
5,POWERFUL AND INSPIRING STUFF!!!!!!,"I was flipping the channels and I so happened to see the ""Crazy"" video. My jaw dropped!!! The music, the lyrics and the spirit: COMBUSTION! I would dare to say that this artist is a POET AND A SPIRITUAL CONVEYOR. I immediately bought the cd, I got more than I bargained for. WOW, WOW, WOW!!!! TRUE POET WITH JAMMING AND AWE INSPIRING MUSIC. LATER, I PURCHASED HIS EARLIER WORKS ""HIS PERFECT IMPERFECTIONS & THE SOUL MACHINE"" WITH ARE ALSO PROFOUNDLY THE SAME AS THE LATTER. GOD BLESS YOU CEE-LO/GNARLS BARKLEY. MAY YOU CONTINUE TO CONVEY GOD AND SPIRIT THROUGH YOU AND YOUR BEAUTIFUL MUSIC. ""WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE."""
5,I love this CD!!!,"C-LO has really put his foot in it this time. All I can say is my husband works out to this CD everyday and I love pumpin it in my ride. Great work, totally different from anything else out there right now.LOVE IT!!!"
4,Convention-bending fun,"I'm new to these artists but I bought the CD mostly because of ""Crazy"" and a general curiosity, piqued by other reviews here. It definitely took some getting used to -- on my first listen it all sounded very random and chaotic, but I find the album is growing on me. One thing I don't quite get, though, is why they opted for what sounds like recording levels set too high on some tracks, so that vocals sound like a radio station not tuned properly (or AM under a bridge!). I don't know if this is a ""thing"" for these artists or the genre, but it still bugs me, kind of like the clumpy paint applications of Van Gogh. ;) I can't say if this will become a favorite album, but it's certainly fun when I'm in the mood for something a little off-kilter."
5,Addictive,"I read a review that said Cee-Lo's voice is part Al Green, Roland Gift (Fine Young Cannibals) and Jimmy Somerville (Bronski Beat). I was intrigued. That compared with the brilliance that is Danger Mouse compelled me to give this CD a listen. Ok. So now I am hooked. This album has crawled under my skin and I can't stop listening to it. A little bit of everything is on here and appeals to all of my musical tastes. I highly recommend this one."
1,let's get 4real,all you cat's need to stop listening to mtv telling you a album or artist is hot just like they did with eminem. this album is trash i heard one person compare it to p funk.this is trash you'll see in a few year's when you'll be using it as a coaster.they using m k ultra (research) on you dummies they play a record so much it convince's you that its something you like wake up people.
1,BUY CARRIE UNDERWOOD CD INSTEAD,"This compact Discs is a joke and has only one good song on it ""crazy."" The people that nominated this over Carrie Underwood Some Heart for Album of the Year must have something good to drink the night before. This Cd is trash and awful to the ears. Buy Carrie Underwood CD instead you will love it!!"
2,It's okay.,I bought this for my husband and he says the whole cd overall is disappointing. He was not too pleased with it.
5,COOL STUFF,Outstanding music. Takes an OUTKAST vibe and goes further! More heart and a definite feel of fun and wild abandon. EVERY song just grabs you and won't let go!
1,Poor quality vinyl.,"First off I LOVE THIS ALBUM, love it. I bought it on vinyl because I wanted to hear every little nuance of Danger Mouse's killer beats and rhythms and Cee-Lo's beautiful, soulful voice. I was enraged when I received the album and it skipped nearly every song. I cleaned the record, cleaned the needle, no difference. So I figured I just got a bad copy of the record. I love this album so much I bought it AGAIN on vinyl and the damned thing skipped in all the same places. I don't know if they are both from a bad batch or if they are just shite quality, but I DO NOT recommend buying this album on vinyl."
2,A Great Voice Wasted,"I bought this because of the hit Crazy....and I must admit that Gnarls Barkley has a very impressive voice. Unfortunately most of the songs on this album sound like they were thrown together by amateurs. Lyrics that must have been picked out of a wastebasket and arrangements and mixing by neophytes on drugs. End result is an inconsistent and unsatisfying mix and a waste of a good voice. I know, there were some who rated this five stars but I'm guessing they have a vested interest in its success. I sure hope that Barkley's newfound popularity lands him a session with professionals because he could do so much better.....and my review would be more flattering."
2,ATL raised NEO SOUL 4 Life,"I really hate ranking this CD this low. I've been a fan of Cee-Lo since the very beginning, and admire his transition from rap to vocal. As soon as I had seen the video ""Crazy,"" I went out and bought Gnarls Barkley's ""St. Eslewhere."" This says a lot because I refuse to watch MTV or listen to heavy rotation radio. I love the underground sound, and this album truly displays such talent. To my regret, ""Crazy"" is the only album likely to see air play. Moreover, the orchestration of the album resembles another ATLiens work...Andre 3000. I really feel that this CD could be called ""The Evolution of the Love Below: pt 3000 featuring Cee-Lo Green."""
2,Incomplete-Could Have been Excellent,"I would rarely take the time to write a review on an album, but felt compelled to let the world know that this album is OVERRATED!The reason why is it is INCOMPLETE. There is some good stuff here, but it is not finished. There is one track over 3-minutes on the album. They should have taken more time and added more to these tracks because they have some good components. Crazy is a good song, Smiling Face...Also Not Bad....Gone Daddy Gone-OK cover, but why bother ...Violent Femmes version is still way better. Dont bother buying this. Download these 3 tracks and your good to go. I hope they build off this album, it could have been excellent...It sounds like an incomplete Outkast album"
5,It's been a while,"This album is excellent. It's been a while since I have listened to an album that was as fresh and interesting as this album. Sure - I really liked ""Crazy"", i know it was a smash, but there were many other song on this album that had a nice beat, interesting lyrics and just ""caught"" something inside of me. I wish the artists all the best and thank them for a nice album"
4,Gnarles Barkley- St. Elsewhere,Another good album by the duo artists of alternative hip-hop with an soulful tune in all of their songs.
2,Less enjoyable than others,We have had other animal books with cut-outs that my daughter enjoyed more. It is not a very enjoyable read for us since we prefer more rhythmic and sing-songy text.
2,Not for a beginner,"I have done quite a bit of tile work and am not a foreigner to trowel trades. When I decided to put in my first brick hearth and wall I looked for a book to give me the basics. This was not it. I feel it is poorly outlined and organized and lacked some basic information I sought. There are some cool projects in it, but start with another book if you're new to the trade."
5,GOOD !!!!!!!!,Good Book ! I would recommend it to others but I would also say that it was not as good as some of the other books that I have ordered. Thanks !!!
2,Subpar Randolph Scott Western,"Scott, working with Andre de Toth, who worked with him in Stranger Wore A Gun, finds himself in a film that does not stack up against the Budd Boetticher Western he made around the same period.Scott plays a rancher in a range war against a bigger, powerful rancher, who has married the woman Scott loves. Scott tries to refrain from violence, but when the other rancher hires gunmen to kill Scott, Scott has to defend himself.Westerns often feature a plot that has been done many times before, but are distinguished by great writing, great action, and great performances, and this film features none of these things. It is great that this film has been released on DVD, but it will not be remembered as one of Scott's better films."
4,Man in the Saddle 1951,"In MAN IN THE SADDLE we see Randolph Scott (1898-1987) in a archetypal role as Owen Merritt , a man of few words , inerring aim and unbreakable principes , who swallow his pride when the woman he loves marries for wealth . But when her wildly jealous husband vows to ruin Merritts Ranch , Merritt strikes back . A Satisfying combination of action , Romance and breathtaking high-desert scenery , MAN IN THE SADDLE also featured Tennesse Ernie Ford (1919-1991) in a rare movie appearance . Great plot and wonderful outdore scenery and Randolph Scott..what more do you need ! . High Qualty digital transfer . Recommended"
1,I wish you could leave zero stars,"I dont know what the other idiots are talking about but the only thing this piece of crap is good for is breaking lights. I cant even get the thing to work when I'm holding it in my hands right in front of me. Much less six feet in the air. Does not hold on o anything. Horrible, I threw it in the trash it was so worthless."
2,Don't do business with this Merchant for any reason,This merchant does not return emails and its voice mailbox is full. Amazon itself can't reach them. Don't do business with them for any reason.
2,Denon AVR-687,"Don't buy it! Powere shut off and power indicator blinks red. The troubleshooter says overheat (I placed a fan over vents) or bad speaker connections at back of unit. I checked, and tried different connections over and over again."
2,O'Keeffe & Stieglitz,I have not read this book. I bought it for a friend. I was disappointed that the book was not in good condition. Several pages were loose and the cover was slightly soiled. This is disappointing because it was supposed to have been a nice birthday gift to a good friend.
3,Cute....for a while!,"Overall, this is a typical Steve Madden shoe that looks great to begin with, then falls apart and causes blisters after a week of wear. I'd recommend these to anyone looking for some cute shoes that they won't wear very hard."
2,"Bland, boring, juvenile","juvenile writings. Perhaps my 9 year old might enjoy it, I, however, did not. Will never read another thing she writes."
4,Very spirtiual and enlightening while being an easy read,"As a member of Lois W.'s 12 step program, I loved the spirituality of this book and its simplicity. It was simple and easy to read, yet contained thought provoking ideas. I was bothered by the fact that the author skipped over commandment five, a major one to discuss in detail, and just skimmed commandment six. If she didn't know how to cover them, omit them or write a longer book as it is only a 147 pages. Because of my spiritual background the other ones were refreshing reminders of my daily program. I was very interested in the author's ideas on these last two and felt cheated as the rest of the book was quite good. My suggestion rewrite it and include these two as they are very important ""commandments""."
5,Full of fantastic messages for all of us,"I was given this book after I had surgery and at a time when I was reading everything I could get my hands on.I must admit the title and opening pages made me stop and wonder if I wanted to go on with this story. But, believe me I am very glad that I did. It is a beautiful and simplistic story that is easy to read and that many of us can relate to. The most important thing to say though is that the messages that this book contains are real, full of meaning and I think can give a lot of hope, reason and enlightenment to all of us."
2,Cornball Spirtual Fable,"Well, if you're looking for enlightment or a life-changing way of thinking after reading this book, chances are - it isn't going to happen.This was like cotton-candy for the female mid-life crisis soul. I don't know, I just felt like it was cute (like fuzzy slippers) cute, but boring as hell on a Harley.Me no likey. Different strokes for different folks, I suppose."
5,Should be required reading for all women!,Have you ever read a book that moved you in such a way that you were challenged to change your life? this is that sort of book. For every woman who has lost her way and just knows there is something more out there.
5,A book to really consider reading,"I received this book from a friend of mine a while back , after undergoing some very stressful times in my life and feeling extremely lost .Let me say that this book was truly a godsend and has provided me with the inspiration i needed at the time to fulfill many avenues of my life .I truly feel content for the first time in my life after getting a message that I know was necessary for my existence .Not everyone will get the same message but everyone will receive an inspirational one ."
4,"It started out sort of corny, but got better the more I read","I wasn't sure I was going to like reading the book when I first started it, but the more I read, the more I got into it. The commandments that Joe gave to Christine are things we all should remember as we live our daily lives, especially the one about living in the moment. The book left me with a warmed heart and a fresh outlook on my own life."
3,Fun story but heavily flawed--covers only 4 of 6 points.,"God takes the emotionally and spiritually bankrupt protagonist on a journey that teaches self-love and authentic living. God, who takes the form of a kind biker, gives the main character six lessons. Unfortunately, the author completely omits the explanation of the fifth lesson (a BIG one) and barely mentions the sixth lesson. I found the story entertaining for a while but was disappointed and confused at the end because of the story's incompleteness."
1,Not for the weak,"I received this book in the mail from a person who said it changed her life. Unfortunetly, like many others, she is unable to distinguish what is real and what is notFirst off, it reads like one of those cheap harliquin romance novels that are written for teenagers. Second, the characters have no depth. They are as shallow as characters on soap operas. And lastly, a fictious story should never change your life or the way you think, if you are using your brain the way it was meant to be used.I think Amazon.com should have a no-star rating, because that's what I would have given this waste of paper."
1,self-help book for the shallow and self-centered,"A friend gave me this book for Christmas, and I thought I was going to love it. Really, the only reason I even finished reading it was because it was so short and I wanted to see what happened. It was like nails on the chalkboard, though. Really.The protaganist was a vain, boy-crazy, wash-up with a high school mentality. She hated her nursing career, which focuses on service and making others feel better. She meets this Jesus character, who instead of spinning the positive messeges of Christian Scripture to fit the modern world, shoots out all this stuff about being happy with yourself and slowing down, etc. The main Christian messege is community and service. He stresses being happy alone and taking care of yourself.He tells her to stop obsessing about men, appearence, and weight, and she ends up with all three ducks in a row. This book is like potato chips for the soul. You read it quick and end up with a funny feeling inside."
1,trying to be open minded,"What I liked about the book is that is is short and used large print, so it is doable in an afternoon. The problem I have with the book is that spiritualy it is just like every other New Age book I have read lately. It pulls you away from God and into yourself, ""The God within"". I have a hard time with the idea of God changing his mind about the Ten Commandments. To describe this book in one word, Sacrilegious."
1,Ick!,"I bought this book because an affable looking woman and fellow shopper at a local bookstore suggested it to me. She proclaimed it was the best book she had ever read.Upon reading the first few pages, I knew this was going to be a very long ride. The author's prose (or lack thereof) was either disturbingly condescending or revealed no real talent. It read like a Judy Blume novel for desperate, single, and aging women, although Blume's novels were well written , with an age appropriate voice.I didn't learn anything from the lessons that I hadn't already known, except that Brady's image of God resembles Billy Ray Cyrus.Not a book for the thinking woman."
1,Wanted to give it zero stars,"Admittedly, the protagonist refers to herself as a card carrying atheist but the story was offensive by the way she made sexual innuendos toward Joe aka ""God"" as well as the flippant manner regarding the out datedness of the Ten Commandments - and I am not a weekly attendee of religious services.Christine wasn't happy with anything in her life - job, city in which she lived, and the fact that she wasn't married. Perhaps there are such women, I'm hoping that they are almost extinct.I will pass the book along to my daughter, for whom I originally purchased the book because of her heartbreak. After all different styles and opinions are what allow us to maintain our individuality."
1,read the bible instead,"If you like to read because you love words and the weaving of tales, then this is not the book for you. But, if you need a Sidney Sheldon version of God, then you might like it. While God on a Harley pretty well represents the biblical story of Christ, it lacks any real writing effort (it's actually really bad. Look for the phrase ""pleased as punch!""). The bible says every knee will bow before God (not necessarily out of the free will of the knee-bearer) and in the novel, the lead character falls to her knees when confronted by God. The book is filled with references to the bible like this one, but the bible is way, way, way, way better."
1,Terrible book.,"This was quite possibly the worst book I have ever read. Luckily, I didn't pay for it, as it was a gift. It's a stupid story lacking inspiration and without a shred of spirituality whatsoever. It's kind of like a christian Harlequin romance. I think it must have been written for brainless women who want to ride on the back of a Harley with God. It fantasizes God as a biker sex object. It's just ridiculous. Did I say dumb??? My intelligence was insulted by this book, as well as my spiritual beliefs. Next, she will probably write ""Buddha on a boogie board""."
5,A Life Changing Book,I am amazed that such a short book could be so powerful. I have read it several times now & recommended it to many of my friends. Thank you Joan for writing such an awesome story!
2,Great Story.......disappointing writing,"Being an Anglophile who loves all things English, especially the Royalty, I was so looking forward to reading this book.And it is informative. However, I find that the Author has a way of presenting a situation, complete with background, in excruciating detail. Plus added footnotes on most of the pages. Instead of a pleasant read, it felt like a textbook that I had to keep up with. A bit irritating, actually.I've never read Gyles Brandreth before, so it may just be his style of writing. I just know it's left me with a bad ""after taste"".Grace B."
3,Hardship and Trials,"I like how this book tells the hardship and trials that Prince Philip has gone through in his life and more so about his life as the monarch's consort. It must have been really hard for a man who cannot give his name to his children, because his wife prefers to keeps the House of Windsor to stand. Princess Diana should've taken her queue from Prince Philip on how to deal with life in the royal lane. Very interesting, sheds a lot of light about how Prince Philip is, not just the sour type of a man the public and media knows or makes him out to be. My only problem on this book is, it tries so hard to portray Prince Philip as the model Prince. It's too Pro-Prince Philip for my taste. This book should have been just about him since it talks and praise the Prince a lot more than it does the Queen."
3,Philip and Elizabeth,"The reader will find very little ""Elizabeth"" in this book. It is a lengthy and detailed account of Prince Philip and for the psycho/socially trained reader provides some insight into the factors that have made him the person he is.....or appears to be. One is left with the impression, however, that the writer had His Highness looking over his shoulder throughout. If the public wants to view Prince Philip as an historical character, not much will be revealed here and chances are it never will. There are still questions about his motivations and true feelings."
3,Older Game,"This game was older and I had to play it on my other computer with WIN98. I was about 3/4 of the way through the game and thought I had picked up an item at the start of the game but it wasn't in my inventory. I had to either restart the game or quit. I quit. It was very had to move to place to place and some of the things had to be repeated over and over. For instance, when you operated the submarine you had to restart it and go back and start the engine and then do everything all over again to make it work. It got very tedious."
3,Not a cat tree!,"It's a kitty tree. Cats are too big for this unit. Cool design, but seller needs to call it what it is."
4,Great cheese primer,"Absolutely amazing primer on cheese. She covers everything from planning a cheese platter, to beverage choices to recipes. The book is also broken down by chapter by cheese type, so you learn the difference between say a goat's milk and a sheep's milk cheese. Her recipes are simple and delicious and really bring out the flavor of each cheese.If you are a cheese lover or looking for a gift for a cheese head - this is the perfect purchase."
4,Pairings Ideas,"The main thrust of this book is to provide ideas for cheese pairings: with fruits, greens, and breads. The cheeses and ideas are grouped with an Introduction, Cow's Milk Cheeses, Goat's Milk Cheeses, Sheep's Milk Cheeses, and Mixed Cheese Platters. The recipes are good, the photos are good. An easy-to-use book that will make you crave cheese and feel confident about serving it."
1,The graphics are poor. The clipart is repetitive and out of date for today's wedding invitations.,"My fiance and I decided to make our own wedding invitations. We bought this product because we believed that since it was a product designed specifically for weddings, we would find a good selection of wedding clip art. We did not. The clip art in this program is disappointing. For instance, they have 46 images of a bride, but all 46 are the same image of a bride, but with different colors. They have 46 grooms, but again, all 46 are the same, but with different colors. The variety is poor as well. If you are looking for wedding clip art, ""Art Explosion: Seasons, Events & Holidays"" has a much better wedding clip art selection than this for the same price! Mountaincow customer service, however, is excellent and they offer a 30 day money back guaranty."
2,Not enough ideas for me,"I wanted a good face painting book to use with my three-year-old, but this book wasn't much help. It has a good tiger and clown. Other faces in the book were either too simple to need directions (i.e. paint a flag on the cheek) or too abstract or scary for my little guy."
2,Ok if you only have five minutes,"This book is for the mom who is looking for something to get her through a birthday party and not for those seriously looking to get into face painting as a serious hobby or business. The faces are basic and offer little for the imagination. If it were much less expensive it would get better reviews, but at the same cost you can get much better face painting books from the market. Check it out at the library instead."
4,Good battery for the price.,"I purchased this battery so I would have a spare one during a recent trip to Disney World. Changing batteries was easy, and they are small enough to keep in your bag until needed. 3 hours of battery time (for the original and spare combined) was enough for most days. One day I forgot to recharge them, but that was my fault."
2,Disappointed,"I was very diappointed with this item. I bought this item because the last battery on our camera lasted for about 5 min on a full charge, and we needed one for our daughter's dance recital. This ""new"" one lasted about 20 min. If someone can tell me that I didn't charge it correctly or something I would greatly appreciate it, but I don't think I did anything wrong"
5,Great Product,This is a great product for your digital camcorder product back up and especially a great price.
5,Excellent on time delivery,I received the product on time next day for my vacation. It worked out very good for me.Thank YouJulie
4,Flibbly..,"..The Renaissance fair (Selena Fox rules!)songs don't ""Do it"" for me but the ""SUngod"" song does it for the earth!Legendsis similar and it was (Gwydion watcha doin?)done by two former members of the Process church oF the final judgement! I'm always gonna recommendSpiritual Bathing: Healing Rituals and Traditions from Around the Worldto all!"
3,"Good, middlin' Scott Western","While Columbia studios' TEN WANTED MEN is not a top drawer Western like COMANCHE STATION or RIDE LONESOME of a few years later, it is never less than entertaining---the kind of ""super B"" feature that enthralled sagebrush-addicts back in the 1950s. Certainly this is no Budd Boetticher directed product, and it lacks his stunning, distinctive touches, but there is enough action to keep any fan glued to his TV set. Richard Boone, who appeared in a number of Randy Scott's 1950s Westerns (most notably in THE TALL T), stands out as a superbly drawn villain. And Scott is always excellent."
5,Ten Wanted men,Randolph Scott was a under rated actor but as for an early action movie star one of the best. You can't go wrong spending time with him on rainy day watching a great old oater.
4,This is a my scene I'll be getting.....,"I Don't really like my scene and I am not an owner of this doll but it is a great idea to be able to change the face (3 very pretty faces) I love the stands that the other extra heads are on because they look like mini styling heads! And the bratz vs my scene thing, in my opinion I am a fan of bratz but I'm NOT saying n e thing mean about my scene. I think my scenes r just as good as bratz. But if I had to say my fave its BRATZ 4 EVA!!AND MY SCENES ALSO ROCK SOME PEOPLES WORLDS!!! I love this doll but it would be the only my scene I would have. =)"
1,*sighjs and thinks about how stupid people are*,"Whats the matter with purple hair streaks???? OMG! its freakin PURPLE freakin hair freakin streaks!!!! Do you not get what I'm saying???? I mean, that would scare me if I saw a person walking down the street with purple hair. wouldn't you??????????????? F*** YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-zoe-zoe-zoe-zoe-zoe-zoe-zoe-zoe-zoe-zoe-zoe-zoe-zoe-zoe-zoe-zoe-"
1,Not really,"Your kinda wrong, Bratz are indead better. they won more awards, and I have met more Bratz fans then My Scene fans. There are a lot of little girls in our school that love Bratz dolls, not one My Scene fan. I love bratz, but I don't like My Scene dolls.P.S. If you think Bratz dolls are slutty, check out the Bling Bling My Scene dolls, OMG they show too much skin, and they are super slutty, and once again, they copied Bratz by putting a belly button ring on them. Copy caters. BOO!!!!"
3,...........,thats nice that yall are friends. but instead of letting the world know can u at least get each others emails or something instead of taking up space on amazon.com?? cuz this a place to write about the dolls. btw i am not a my scene fan
1,hahaha,One of her heads with the wavy hair has lips that look like they've been banged onto a wall so hard that they got swollen and purple.
1,You want a doll that can change heads?,"If you want a GOOD doll, that's pretty, fun AND fashionable, Then I reccomend you get the Bratz Head Games. It rox! My Scene dolls are ugly....and have absolutley no quality. Soon you will learn that my scene dolls are fake bratz wannabees.......BRATZ FOREVER,MY SCENE NEVER!!!!!"
4,Review,"I think My Scene dolls are cool and cute, and I do collect them! I don't like Bratz but if you do, I don't 'hate you!!!!' or 'YOU SHOULD LOVE MYSCENE OMG!!!' I think this Nolee is especially cool because she has three different heads. My sister always complains that she can't make dolls hairdos, this may be a perfect doll for people like her! I also like the themes of the outfits, the sort of 'punky' outfit shows my scene don't always wear fancy, elegant things. Way to go Mattel!"
5,Thank you Buttoms!!!You are so cool too!!!!(Sara Siblini here),"Hey Buttom.You rock!!!Wanna become friends with me,Chelsea Churro,*******MY SCENE QUEEN*******,and Lisa???Give me an awnser.By the way,this doll is gorgeous.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*"
1,DeLonghi should refund the money for this pot,I too had the problem with the clear plastic part of the lid breaking but after only 2 months. I called them and they said I could order the part for $21 and $5 shipping. What a joke. The pot cost me $48. It was on back order anyway. The one thing I did like about it was the adjustable strength dial. I like strong coffee and the other pots I had before that one made weak coffee unless you put in a half pound of coffee. I used my great aunts GE for 8 years and she had had it for 15 so we got the moneys worth for that one. Still searching for a new one with adjustable strength and using the old drip one in the mean time.
2,Lid Broke,"I had this percolator for about 1.5 years before I experienced the same issues with the lid as other reviewers here. It made great coffee, the unit is attractive and convenient. The lid was always difficult to remove and from all that tugging, the clear plastic piece on the top eventually broke. There are 2 little plastic pieces that hold it on to the metal lid. One gave way about a year or so after using the product, but I was still able to use the machine. We used our product everyday. Then a few months later, the other plastic piece broke and now there is nothing to secure the plastic top to the lid base. I could not find a replacement online. If it wasn't for the lid, I would have given the product 5 stars. I am now in search for a new percolator. I considered giving this one another try since it did last for a year and half with no issues, but given the other reviewers postings, I don't think I'll chance it now, especially at $150."
4,Good for a cheap case,"If you just want a cheap protective case for your Zune, this is a good buy. It is durable and feels as if it won't ever break under normal use. If you want to be able to drop it and not worry about breaking it, buy something more expensive. This is a good protective case against scratches and stuff. I like it."
4,"""Wonderful""","This movie makes you laugh through the characters difficult times, and rejoice in loud hallelujah's when they learn to spread their wings and fly. It is truly a family movie that all will enjoy. I will go see it again, and can't wait for the DVD.God bless!"
3,Funny but sends some mixed messages,"I love Madea. I have seen both films and laugh all the way thru them. I have also seen the plays on video, but not live. Madea gives some incredible life messages and actually the whole ""branches and roots"" message helped me see the light on a situation. However, I found it disturbing when Madea started beating the girl with a belt. There is no situation when a child should be beat. Also the hot grits in the face was more disturbing than funny. She probably disfigured that man. Madea was giving out the message in this film that physical revenge is the best way. And I do not agree."
4,Pretty good,This was not one of my most favorite Tyler Perry movies/plays but it was still funny. I enjoy the movies better than the plays.
1,This is funny?,"Nope, it is not funny. Some people might not consider me qualified to review this, as I did not even finish watching it, but personally, I was highly offended. Madea is nothing more than violent and abusive. End of story. Once she got out the belt and started beating her foster child, I had to turn it off, as I was highly disturbed. Who promotes this as being funny? That is a sad situation which unfortunately happens to lots of kids, and as a teacher and former camp counselor, I have unfortunately had direct contact with many children who have been abused in a similar way. I am sure anyone who has had direct experience with victims of abuse would agree with me that it is never funny to promote any form of domestic abuse. And all the other scenes were extremely boring. Do not watch this movie, unless you think abuse is funny, and then you are just sick."
2,Not The Best Of Tyler Perry's work...,"I really enjoyed ""Diary Of A Mad Black Women"" and some of Tyler Perry's other movies but I did not enjoy this movie. The previews made it look funny but there was only a few laughs... and Madea did not have a lot of scenes in this movie as I would have thought and it was very disappointing. This movie was sadly quite boring compared to the other movies!!"
3,DIDN'T LIKE ENDING,"Actually I'd give 3 1/2 stars.AHHHH I wished 'ugly' sister has gotten back Lynn Whitfield's charater good. She gives her a kiss at the end. Also, how could you continue any relationship with a mother like that(meaning the 'pretty sister'). Anyhow, although Diary was better, I did enjoy the drama in this film also. Lookout for the wedding scene--it's beautilful."
3,Well...,"It was well done on screen, but I still prefer the play. This movie, for anyone living under a rock, is about a woman who's getting married and isn't in love with her abusive fiancee, and getting the strength through her family to leave him. She learns about herself and her sister, and discovers her worth. What I liked about the movie version is that she did it without having a man ""showing her"" what real love is....so to me it was actually a little more powerful done this way rather than how the play did, with that guy coming around.It's a good one, but I would recommend you watching the play then the movie."
5,Tyler Perry's best film,"This movie has it all,Madea,the way we love her the most,funny,honest,and doesn't take crap from no one.Ohio valleys own,Blair Underwood(Were very proud of this great actor from our home town) in a very Evil role that has to be very hard to play,and the great Cicely Tyson and Maya Angelow.The movie has a message for everyone,and that's why this is my favorite Tyler Perry movie."
1,why do they bother,"seen it,heard it,went to sleep on a ton of similar crap.a smart alecky wannabe comedian in senior citizen drag...mar'in lawrence beat this pile with his pile.from the looks of it,the target audience loved this."
4,IT JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER!,Standing applause for Tyler's Perry's Family Reunion. I laughed cried (I mean really cried!) and found myself loving the wonderfulness of family all over again.TP's ability to push our buttons worked wonderful and I found mystlf = even after going to the movies to see it - I watched this on DVD over and over again because it was just that good.Gimme more Tyler! Gimme More!Sylvia HubbardAuthor of Stone's Revenge and Mistaken IdentityFounder of Motown Writers NetworkCo-Founder of Essence of Motown Literary Conference
3,One of the ok films from Tyler Perry,"It was ok, not anything spectacular. The series seems to be getting aged and a bit repetitive but it's a quick funny movie."
3,Amazon purchased dvd,This movie was Okay. Wasn't really crazy about it.I found it a little boring at times. Not that funny eighter.Wouldn't recommend.
5,5 stars!!,"if you like neon colors this is just what you're looking for, it's a very bright neon orange lol it does have a radiance to it, looks great in any light. but i will say it doesn't look just like the pic, in the pic it has a gold-ish (maybe cooper) hue which it doesn't have in real life as i said it is a very bright neon orange. i personally LOVE it and i'm getting another for my friend who i know will love it too."
1,Cheaply made,"Don't buy this unless all you are going to do is pull it around a small yard with a garden tractor. We bought ours three days ago and have used it for about three hours per day spreading lime in our pasture. We have to keep stopping to fix it. The metal plate that closes the opening is so thin, it bends when you push it closed, so then the material will just pour out when you stop. The part that turns and spreads the material can come loose and become free turning and then it will just basically drop the lime under the spreader instead of the wide path it should make. We've had to fix that too. In addition, it doesn't hold it's settings well. It has vibrated closed so we had to jerry rig it to stay open with a bungee cord. It has come too far open as well. I""m glad I bought it locally as it is going to get returned to the store. It is a piece of junk."
4,Better than the rest,I purchased this item from the local Tractor Supply for 199.00 plus tax and the box was in great shape. Most of the complaints on the shipping of most spreaders was the box and product was damaged in transit. The only problem so far was that I need to tighten up the lever that allows the flow of material. It kept sliding back to off while spreading material. Love Love Love the size of this thing! Big enough to get the job done without multiple refills. Handled well over rough terrain. I just had 20 acres dozed clear and the ground was very rough--so rough that the cheap earthway spreader only made two trips out and broke. So I spent the extra money on this one and not disappointed. I use my 4 wheeler to pull this hopper and it has a pull pin on the axle to disengage the spinner assembly so I can run fast back to the house.
2,Very poor customer service.,"The first unit that was shipped was destroyed in transit so badly that FedEx didn't even deliver it and the second unit was severely damaged. I asked the manufacturer to send some replacement parts and they sent the wrong ones. They finally did send the correct parts and I managed to get the unit assembled and working. So far it seems to do OK. Out of the four shipments I received, three of them were poorly packaged and they were very uncooperative about using a different carrier that was more convenient for me."
5,The Only Bible to Read,"I wonder if many folks realize that The New English Bible is not a revision of some previous translation of The King James Version but rather an entirely new translation from original manuscripts including the use of the Dead Sea Scrolls. This information was on the fly-leaf of the very first edition of The New English Bible first published about 1960 (Old Testament). Since so many of the words have changed their meanings over the years since KJV and since there are many translators not just one person who did this entirely new translation, it is my opinion that this is by far the best means to study the Bible and to understand what the Christian Faith is."
1,Needed it and wanted to love it...but...,"I received the package and everything was fine. However, the spring latch/catch mechanism that keeps the umbrella in the open position would get stuck in the ""in"" position and wouldn't spring back out to hold the umbrella in place :-(. I returned it in the hopes of an exchange, but they were on backorder. I hope everyone else got a non-defective version than I did."
4,Great Umbrella,"This is definitely a high-quality umbrella. Sturdily built, attractive design, and better coverage than any other umbrella I've had. We have dogs and find this size of umbrella tremendous for rainy day walks. Wish we had found this product years ago."
1,Disappointed,"After one use, this umbrella broke. It will not stay opened. It is a difficult umbrella to use as it does not have automatic open and close buttons. I would not recommend this umbrella. Also, when it arrived, it had a horrible smell that permeated my entire house. I am particularly frustrated because I threw out the box when it arrived and it will be very difficult for me to return this lemon."
2,Handle with care!,"We've used our Gustbuster umbrella a few times and it broke! The plastic hinges are prone to braking so handle with care. The ubrella has a warranty, but it will cost you $10 and shipping to get it fixed. I've had other golf type umbrellas with metal hinges that lasted a very long time, so be advised and treat with care."
5,Great for older Zune...,"It's a great fit and makes buttons etc. easy to use while attached to arm. I use it at the gym and holds up well while on the treadmill! Even when your arms swell lifting weights, the elastic band makes easy to adjust or gives just enough to keep the unit secure at all times. I've gone through many cases, mainly made for the ipod, but this is a perfect fit and you just can't beat the price/functionality. Thank you so much for your wonderful product and service!"
1,Zune DLO Action Jacket,This item looked great but I did not open and returned it because it was too big for the 2nd generation Zune which is much smaller than the original Zune. The 2nd generation Zune would have fallen out of this jacket immediately. Unfortunately most of the Zune items do not mention which size the product is for.
2,Not what it says it is,"Beware when buying this item. Although the qualityof it is very good, this is not for the 80 gb Zune. it came up when I searched for cases for my Zune, and I didn't check closely enough. It is listed as a case for Zune, but doesn't specify. It does work.... they are similar sizes, but it is annoying to use the squircle with the case on. I have recently bought another case, but will still use this one since the armband is very comfy. In cosing, good case, just poor description."
1,Dissatisfied Customer,I can't review this item because I never recieved it. The company does not ship to APO/FPO addresses which would have been nice to know ahead of time. And I'm still waiting on my refund.
5,awesome for the price,"This seems to be the best zune armband out there. I can't remember if it was supposed to but mine came with a belt clip too. If you need a zune armband, look no further. I love this one"
4,Action Jacket,This product is good for its price. Belt piece is kinda easy to lose ( but so are most small parts). I wouldn't reccomend it if you have small arms( the band is kinda big).
4,Good deal,Brand new in the package; quick shipping; great price! Couldn't find these in the store anymore because it's an older Zune.
5,A Nice Case For The Zune,"I have bought four of these cases and like them. It was made for the 30 GB Zune, but I like it for the 80 GB also. It is a little big for the 80, but I like the ease of use and the proection that it gives to the Zune."
5,Great accessory!,"I was sooo happy when I realized there was a product like this available, and I was not disappointed! The arm band is a little weird, but the belt clip works great and the case keeps the Zune nice and protected. This has made the Zune a permanent part of my every day!"
4,Works for 30g and 80g models,I ordered this case for my 30g 1st generation zune and it works great. I recently upgraded to the 80g 2nd generation zune and the case works fine. Its not as snug as it was on the 30g but the player still does not shift around. I use it at the gym with no issues.
5,Great case with belt clip and arm band.,"Well, basically this thing does its job and does it well. I love the fact that I can now simply store my Zune in my pocket without having to baby the screen so much due to the integrated screen cover. I will say that dust seems to love the screen (getting between the case and the Zune itself) but overall it is an excellent product and was very much worth the price paid. Also, it is extremely sturdy and has a wonderful grip on it so it makes it much more difficult to drop in case you are accident prone. Lastly, with the included belt clip, I can attach it to workout pants/shorts, pretty much anything and it holds very tight and secure."
4,Good Value,"This product seems to provide good protection and permits you to clearly see the screen, when lit. The case is of a ""condura"" like material with the plastic, covering the screen, clear and slightly flexible. The case provides easy access to all the buttons and inputs. To the rear of the case are two loops which accomodates the armband or your belt, of your choice.Cons: None"
1,Horrible Production Value,This is the most boring DVD I have seen! My child has no interest in this.The production quality is terrible. The puppets are cheap. The camera man can't even stay in focus. Now I need to figure out how to send these back.
1,Numeros y Figuras,"This DVD is very poorly done. The Spanish spoken by the cheap-looking puppets is not clearly articulated and there are no English or Spanish subtitles. There are a couple songs in Spanish, but again no subtitles, so it sounds like inarticulate rambling to children who don't speak Spanish. More attention to audio/visual detail and consideration of how children learn is needed. We wasted our money on this purchase for our twin daughters, and suggest you make a different purchase."
4,Going places,"Written in 1957, this is a fairly routine account of tourism in the West, which began in the 1880s (the creation of Yellowstone Park was a big boom for the industry). In a large country it was difficult to do much touring when there was no means to do so except in a horse and buggy. The expansion of the railrods, therefore, contributed greatly to getting people to visit different places not necessarily on the beaten path. Pomeroy discusses railroad travel, resort hotels, dude ranches, California, the sportsmen (hunters and fishermen), health seekers, and other factors. The book attempts to cover a bit too much ground and comes across as somewhat superficial at times because of that. A decent introduction to the topic, however."
1,Poorly organized kills it,"I wanted to like this book. However, with a horribly faulty index, lots of repetition masked by the author's cute made-up names for certain drinks... I definatly wouldn't buy this book again. If this book was organized by main ingredient or season or SOMETHING useful other than alphabetical order per the random naming by the author (and the index that attempts some organization is wrong oh so many times) it would be somewhat useful. As I said, a lot of drinks repeat themselves (Blueberry mixed with orange juice and then the same mixed with- oh! Look! Pineapple now!) but the author gave them cute names so they are all over the book alphabetically so it makes it an absolute mess to find the same thing twice. This book's only function is a grab-bag type thing- open and point your finger and hope you have all the ingredients!"
2,Got any cucumber juice?,"Yeah, I didn't think so. I wanted a book on making smoothies with everyday items, and this wasn't it. It seems you should have a juicer to utilize the majority of the recipes in this book....I was unaware of that. Even if I had the juicer, I really wasn't that impressed with this book. A lot of the recipes seemed very similar to me. Well, I'm off to find the perfect smoothie book so I can get that VitaMix earning it's keep!"
2,Not for me,"A lot of the drinks have odd names, they are listed alphabetically so if your looking for a smoothie you need to read each recipe and define which one is a smoothie, a shake, a frappe or a regular mixed drink. I was hoping to turn to the smoothie section and pick a recipe. Guess I'll look for another book and be more careful about the one I choose."
3,"Listen to the clips once, think twice","I wish anybody had mentioned this about this album before I bought it, so I'm telling you: this edition has been post-processed with a reverb that surely wasn't there when Lomax recorded it. Sometimes it's not especially intrusive, but sometimes it's aggressively metallic and artifical. Serves me right for trying to cheap out, and failing to listen to the clips. If this bugs you as it does me, do yourself what I'm going to do next time, buy the Rounder edition of ""Prison Songs (Historical Recordings From Parchman Farm 1947-48)""."
3,"Great music, no liner notes",This is an excellent recording with almost no context. The liner notes (all of two paragraphs) don't say anything about when the songs were recorded of how Lomax got access to the prisoners. The sound is excellent.
4,Recorded in a large room with one mike,"The reverb on this recording is good old fashioned-echo. It comes from using a single mike in a large, empty room. Not scratchy acetate, that's for sure. The sound is as ""authentic"" as the late-50s would give you."
4,A Nice Little Mystery Puzzler!,"This entry in the George Felse series is well-worth a read. In it we see the Felse family on vacation at the seaside. The action of the book takes place over a six day period, but in that time they find evidence of smuggling, a missing body in a family crypt and two murders. (one from about 3 years ago and one most recent). The weird thing about these two murder victims is that their bodies are found in an old family crypt in a stone coffin that is actually minus the original body that was supposed to be there. It's a nice little puzzler that has two or three plot strands running through it. These separate strands do meet up together in the end though, and the mysteries are solved. Great story."
4,Rear floor mat,"I had to trim the mat, but otherwise, I haven't had anyone ride in the back seat yet to see if they will stay in place."
4,"Authentic ""pikilia""",This CD is a great sampling of authentic greek folk songs from all regions of greece: mountain to island!
3,good music regardless of the singer/artist,"Lets be serious just a minute! In this day and time there are very few artists who can play an instrument, write their own lyrics, produce, so forth and so on. What was the big deal here?Everything is done with sampling and computers. Heck, you dont even need talent(can you say ""Busta Rhymes""). All I know is that the album standing alone is decent. Infused with ""Girl you know its true"" the album is above average. Good music plain and simple. And they didnt even need to use epic profanity to get attention(can you say ""anything considered modern rap or R/B)."
4,Great memories,"Not much needs to be said other than out of all the Mill Vanilli cd's, this is probably their greatest and the fact that they're still out there is great."
5,An Extraordinary Achievement,"We are dealing here with an extraordinary achievement, an encyclopedic study which should prove to be one of the very few volumes with staying power and definitiveness to be worthy of a place on a reading and reference bookshelf in the libraries of generations of Jews to come... Page after page, the book lifts the veil which reveals the Jewish innermost soul, the richness of the Jewish mind and character... Among the most uplifting, spirited, and valuable books on a subject whose depth we are now beginning to explore."
2,NOT AS PICTURED,"Like most Amazon items... received this one in record time. Quality and appearance are very good, and I'm confident that my diehard Alabama fan nephew is gonna love it! Gave it 2 Stars because its not at all like the one pictured at the time of my purchase. The one received does have similar gray and crimson colors but with a different style of elephant pictured on the left and a big A with the words Alabama Crimson Tide encircled on the right (I've since added the image to this product page). I think I might like the original design a little better but the one received still looks good. Oh!... and one last thing... WAR EAGLE!"
4,Great knife for every day use.,"If you're looking for a great fillet knife in the sub $80 price range, this is it. I consider this to be every-day kitchen quality but not quite restaurant quality. If you fillet chicken more than 3 hours a day, then I doubt you're considering this knife anyway.It is very sharp and has a good flex for de-boning small game.The only possible negative I want to draw attention to is this: the cutting edge continues to the point where the blade meats the handle. So, if you have a high grip you may lose some skin on your fore-fingers. In other words, get used to gripping this knife directly on the handle instead of choking up on it."
4,I'LL SLICE YOU TO RIBBONS!!,"Very sharp and moderately flexible filet knife, i use it to filet my tout and bass during fishing season. The only drawback is it is way overpriced but expect to get many years of good use assuming I keep it sharpened after every use : )"
3,To be used as a study aid only,"I bought this book on an impulse, and I still haven't made up my mind on it. The lessons are nice and there is plenty of dialogue, yet the majority is romaji. Some of the vocab lists are all romaji and all the dialogue is. Other tables use kana and kanji. It is a fine book if you use it as a supplement (as it says) but don't buy it expecting to base your Japanese study around it else you will be disappointed. All in all I felt it was a bit too basic, and my Japanese is really not that good."
3,its not what i expected,this book wasn't very interesting to me.. it was rather dry in my opinion.. i got it because i had luck with their algebra the easy way book.. because i had such high expectations for the book i was extra disappointed when it wasn't as good as the algebra book..its not awful.. it just didnt meet my expectationsoh and it introduces kana but doesnt use it for most of the pronounciationsits ok as far as texts go
3,Arab Mediterranean c.1900 tour,"Contents include; Algiers, Genoa, Athens, A City of Illusion (Constantinople), The Turk and some of his Phases, Abdul Hamid II (His Imperial Majesty, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire), Islam, Ephesus, Syria, Damascus, Nile, Karnak and Luxor, Egypt and much more. The Author was an old friend and biographer of Mark Twain, and dedicated this book to him."
3,Pool Test Kit,The product was not delivered as described in the web sight. The websight displayed the test kit in a carring case. The product delivered was in a plastic clam shell. It is very difficult to maintanin all of the chemicals and vials in the clam shell.
2,Very slow service,Ordered this product almost two weeks ago and still have not received same. Wish the company OpticSalewould ship same out when they stated. Oh well live and learn. :(
2,Too scripted.,it started out as a good concept. but now it has become way to scripted and predictable that it has lost its appeal.
5,Gene Simmons Family Jewels: Complete Season 4,"I love Gene Simmons Family Jewels shows. I have added this dvd to my season 1,2,& 3 collection.I really love this collection."
3,Fish netting,"While I like that it is nylon, that is about all I like. It says it is 5'x10', not quite. More like 3'x7'. We made it work with what we wanted to use it for but we are very disappointed in the size. No holes in it, but it has a big section which is frayed and looks like someone used a hot glue gun to fix it. Quality is poor. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Poor Quality,"Delivery of the product was earlier than expected and when I opened it, I was very hopeful having returned a couple of other nets before. Unfortunately, when I pulled the entire net out, there was a huge hole towards one end. It wasn't that the knot had come loose, it was actually not even tied. Returning it would cost more than the net itself so I'm resorting to ""fix"" it by patching it with natural jute twine. Very disappointed in this."
3,Hot But Not Enough Substance,"I purchased this book on a recommendation from a friend because she said it had a great storyline and was ""hot"".The graphic sex scenes are what made it so hot. The plot was interesting and there were plenty of surprises that kept me reading to find out what would happen next, but I was a bit disappointed in the development of the storyline.There were parts of the story that seemed to be rushed, summarized or skipped like when you try to squeeze a thousand page novel into a two hour movie. The book would have been much better if the author had spent as much time expanding or developing the storylines as she did in detailing the sex scenes.All in all if you're looking for a spicy quick to read book...buy it!"
2,Oh boy...,"I was put off by not only the borderline pornography of the book, but also by the somewhat fragmented plot. I am a fan of erotica that is tastefully done (i.e. Zane, of Erotica Noir)...this wasn't it. The characters seemed to be overdone, especially Wellington (I kept thinking of Beef Wellington). The plot was, most of the time, predictable. Some of the minor characters shone through, like Jada's mother and her boyfriend, as they were very down-to-earth. On a positive note...Mary's poetry in the book was BEAUTIFUL. But overall, I was disappointed."
1,If You Like Porn....,"then this is the book for you. This was selected by my bookclub and all of 12 of us HATED IT! The characters are phony, the plot really stupid and it had too much explicit sexual situations that made us all barf! Then at the end does the author try to be a Iylana Vanzant and tell us how to find your ""Soulmate."" If you are into porn on the page, look no further, this is your book!"
2,They Were Not Soul Mates,"When I think of Soul Mates I think of people who are destined to be together, who know from that first look, who grow together, and share, bring out the best in each other. What I don't think of, are two lust-filled people, who include someone else in their intimacy that should only be meant for them, lying, cheating and hipocrisy. With that said, if you plan to read this story based on the title, you will be sadly misdirected. This book's main objective seems to be to heighten your libido and nothing else."
3,Not my first choice,"Too much time was spent of sex scenes. There were some unexpected events and some unrealistic ones as well. The book had a good flow and there were times that I wanted to read more. However, this book would not be my first choice."
1,The novel is an awful piece of poorly written garbage!!!!,"This book should be located in the porno district with a blue stained cover on it, instead of being portrayed as a mainstreamed love novel. It's nothing more than porno under the guise as true literature. I believe the book should have been written mainly for the XXX market instead of being sold as a romance novel. When the author writes about the numerous sexual encounters between the characters, the novel flows akin to XXX pornorgaphy. But the book tries to come off or should i say get off, as a love story. The only love that i saw in this novel was actually the word love since it was pure porno for hornos. The book is poorly written, the characters are ghetto fabulous at best, and every gauche brand consumer goods were repeatedly named throughout the novel. Its too bad there isn't a minus star category, because i certainly would give this book minus 5 stars. Borrow the book, i did don't waste your money."
3,I am confused,"Why was Jada referred in the book at one point as a Christian Woman? Why did Jada agree to do the do with Wellington and you know who? The book has it moments, however, I guess the sequel will piece it all together. This book is full of sex. This one was very confusing especially about a church woman with worldly ways. Will those who write about christian women identify them from church women because there is a difference. We all are not perfect but lets not be confusing. There are other parts in the book that did help it out once you got beyond all the sex drama."
2,Soul Mates? More Like Sex Mates!,"This novel was basically a soft porn story. And like any porno flick, the storyline isn't important; the SEX scenes are! The sad thing about this book is that the story could have actually been interesting, and even thought-provoking, if Morrison had written the whole book with the fervor she wrote the sex scenes with, if she had a better editor, and if she had given her characters a little more depth. She actually had a pretty good story, she just didn't give it the proper attention, so it didn't flourish. I won't even go into how in the world Morrison's characters were such committed church-going people, when they were giving satan himself a run for his money the rest of the week. Too much attention was given to carnal desires and material gain for anybody with a half a brain to believe that this book had ANYTHING to do with soul mates."
2,A Tad Unbelievable,"This book was an interesting read, however I found it unrealistic and unbelivable and irritating at best. The two characters were imo not soul mates whatsoever. If ever I character I disliked in a book, it was this guy Wellington. Being written as all that, didn't convince me that he was. He wasn't! As for Jada I wondered, after the huge mistake she made, I wondered what kept her thinking about this man. It bothered me to read her confusion about this relationship. (...) I was disappointed in the woman she thought she needed to be, the one that thought Wellington was worth the time of day.(...)"
3,ENTERTAINING READ!,"Soulmates Dissipate is definitely not the type of book I normally read, but I did enjoy it for the entertainment (DRAMA) it encompasses. The characters in this book will take you on a roller coaster ride with their issues of love, infidelity (the sexcapades are SIZZLING), greed, pride, lies, and deceit. All the ingredients for a blockbuster that main stream readers will feast on.The book also contains a reading group guide, which is excellent for this type of read. It leaves you wanting to discuss the issues and drama in the story. It also includes a sort of reflective self help guide if you will for ""The Art of Finding Your Soul Mate,"" which added a little substance for this entertaining read."
2,An exiting read for those who love mild porn sex scenes,"The catchy title made me buy this book but I was disappointed after the first couple chapters. The characters are too beautiful and rich to be real and the plot too is unbelievable.I really wanted to see the relationship between Jada and Wellington expand beyond the cliches that we are used to reading about contemporary successful black couples but Mary B. Morrison just did not deliver. Jada came off as being desperate and childish and Wellington came across as being a typical black male who cannot resist raunchy sex with another woman (Melanie) thereby breaking his woman's heart. In many ways this book was a ghetto fabulous read but for the serious reader, its appeal is minimal.In the end, we are left to wonder if Jada and Wellington will get together again but if the sequel is anything like its Soul Mates Dissipate I will not read it."

3,"Thankfully, this one dissipates quickly","I rarley give a book that I complete less than three stars, because if it is any worse I have to put it down. I was tempted. However, as one of the previous reviewers stated it is ""catching"" and that was worth an additional star. Otherwise, it was another Bold, Beautiful and Black story. I didn't care about the characters, though their sex lives could be characterized as interesting if not downright poronographic. For the most part, they were shallow, greedy and self-indulgent. Or they were the opposite end of the spectrum. As for the use of literary device, foreshadowing and desription, they were either too obvious and/or too difficult to follow. The subplot was way too contrived, and the ending pretty much tells the whole story. However, the most annoying thing about this book was the Art of Finding Your Soul Mate portion. (...)"
4,When can we expect the sequel?,"Soul Mates Dissipate is flying off the shelves here in Chicago, and now that I've completed this enjoyable first novel, I understand why! A diverse cast of characters nearly had me skipping pages to see what was up next! I also enjoyed how she incorporated poetry into her book, especially in Diamond's letter to Wellington. And those lovemaking descriptions! Spicy, delicious, delectable - I'll stop now! I am definitely looking forward to the sequel."
4,Hot and steamy,"Soul Mates Dissipate was an easy to read novel filled with secrets, betrayal, deception and love. Wellington and Jada were sure they were each others soul mate until Melanie showed up for a visit. I felt that Jada made one bad mistake that added icing to the drama. After you read the novel, you'll see what I'm talking about. Wellington was a very intelligent man but was thinking with the wrong head. Cynthia was full of herself. She got on my nerves early on. I'm hoping for a sequel. Best wishes to the author. Be Blessed!"
4,Getting Pass the Steamy Scenes,"The sex scenes were steamy and a bit too explicit for my taste... but beyond the sex scenes is a story line. I enjoyed the characters as the author introduced them. There was some mystery in how the story line would play out, with some surprises along the way. The author shows how pretentious we can be in our lives: pretend social status, pretend christians, pretend friends and lovers. I think it was well worth the read. I would read the sequel."
4,Good book,I liked this book for alot reasons it has a little of it all in there spice stabbing in backs all kind of stuff no murder! But this book will have you wanted to read more and more just to find out what happen in the end
2,My Interest Dissipated!,"This novel was a disappointment. I read it because it was a book club selection. The characters were shallow, at best, and the plot was often confusing and extremely unrealistic. Jada Diamond Tanner comes across as a savvy, intelligent young woman who knows what she wants in life and in a mate. Her actions were totally opposite of this. The same can be said for her ""soul mate"" Wellington. Despite being so in love with Jada he is lured away by a childhood family friend, Melanie. As the plot thickened, the storyline became less and less plausible. The love scenes, though a little risque...No, they were HOT!!... held my attention more effectively than the pretentious, unrealistic, way too perfect characters. Finally, I could have done without the Soul Mate Guide at the end of the book. This one is not high on my list of recommendations."
2,Reviews are deceptive,"I was drawn to this book by the reviews I read. But the lesson learned this time around is that reviews can be deceptive.This story was underdeveloped and cliche. It seemed that Morrison did a really bad edit job and cut out alot of important details, OR she just failed to fully expand the story. As I read chapter after chapter, it felt as though there were large gaps that prevented me from getting into the book. I felt that I was being left out of what was really going on. Furthermore, the grammatical and spelling errors were slightly distracting.I would not recommend this book, unless you're looking for an example of the ill effects of a self-published book...sure you'll get a few readers to buy into the hype the first or second time, but they will not come back for more."
5,Excellent Book,"I really enjoyed this book. I read alot of books, and I think this one measures up to some of the best. Highly recommended."
3,It Was Just Okay. Nothing Special,"Before reading this book I read Carl Weber's Baby Momma Drama. Unfortunately for Mary B. Morrison, Carl Weber was a tough act to follow. This story was just okay. I can't say that it is something I will remember reading. The writing style seemed really juvenile and basic. Even the sex scenes left much to be desired. I didn't feel like there was any passion behind the writing, just someone telling a story. It also seemed to jump around a bit. It didn't flow as smoothly as it could have. When a book is really good you hate to see it come to an end. I was okay with this book ending. In fact, I encouraged it to end."
5,Soul Mates Dissipate,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I honestly had never heard of the author before. One day while riding home from work a friend intoduced me to the book and I could not put it down.In my present relationship I could understand everything Jada was going through (where everything seems SO right).I have emailed my friends and told them to go out and purchase that book. Although I borrowed a friends copy I plan to buy my own and get my boyfriend a copy.I say to Mary B. Morrison ""Keep up the good works""."
1,A real mess.,"I'm glad I didn't buy this from Amazon, because I saved myself the cost of sending it back by mail. The first page I looked at contained two glaring errors. While the sheer volume of statistics is impressive, what good are they if you can't trust them? I found this book to be inaccurate and full of sloppy fact-finding. It even contradicts itself! The author is obviously quite proud of his accomplishment, which is touching, but there is no excuse for errors in statistics and other matters of record."
3,The Pro Football Encyclopedia,"Its not quiet what I wanted , but close . Lots of stats and names I haven ' t seen or heard of in a long time. I ' m trying to bring back the memories of those good ole days in the NFL. This book is a goody."
5,The best guide to making the bock style,"If you have read any book that tells you how to make a Bock Style I can almost guarantee you that they are actually quoting this book. Darryl Richman is a beautiful and clear writer who explains the triple decoction method better than just about any other writer, or they are drawing from this book. This is a classic.This book is fairly advanced and I would not recommend this series for the beginner or low experience brewer as Richman does give some very technical descriptions about mash chemistry which are important to understand for this style but would be very overwhelming if you are starting out. If you are an advanced brewer, this is a beautiful series and should be read by everyone as this series shows up in the reference section of almost all of the books I have read."
5,great all around brewing tips,"This book is not only great for brewing bock beer, I was amazed at the tips and information that I have never came across before. Read this book and you will brew better beer in all styles."
4,Very good book,"A very different storyline than any other I have read. While I enjoyed the way Jeff seeks after Cassie, it does seem rather odd that he goes from almost committing suicide over the death of his wife to seeking so ardently after Cassie. I really liked the interaction between the two and the fact that there was some sexual contact, though in a very appropriate way. Sentences were kind of short and choppy sometimes, and was sometimes difficult to follow the meaning of what was being said. But still a very good book."
3,"Nice material, but see-through in the light",Get a darker color than yellow since it is slightly see through when held up to the light. Can see face cards at the bottom of the deck pretty easy.
4,Avoid red and yellow,"No complaints about the quality/function of these cards. However you can see through the red and yellow cards. Make sure you pick blue, green, or black and you will be satisfied."
4,Expansion Drive Set Is Worth It!,"I purchased three expansion drives sets for the three-way holder from Calumet. The product is high quality. The chain drive works well - it makes life so much easier. The ONLY problem I have is the 9' rolls will ""smile"" (sag) after about a month or so. This is not the fault of the system, but of the cardboard roll the paper is on. Anything that long and heavy will sag in time. The only answer I have is every couple of days turn the paper 1/2 turn to avoid the sag. Taking the paper down for storage is not practical and defeats the purpose of having them on the drive set. If the sagging problem can be over-come than this is the best system ever....!"
3,German Military Marches - Air Force Band - Table of Contents,"A good but not outstanding selection with each piece well executed. The English translations of the march titles are frequently not only incorrect or incomplete but also misleading. Some examples: Fehrbellin is an important element of the corresponding march title. Yorck was a Prussian general making a political decision that initiated the defeat of Napoleon. His military unit cannot be termed a York army. The term ""mounted calvary"" is not only a spelling error but also demonstrates ignorance of German history. etc.,etc., etc."
5,Fur Kaiser und Vaterland!,"A thoroughly Deutsch collection!Here we have a foot-stomping selection of some of the best military-marches of German origin. Most of these tunes are 19th century parade-ground music, with some newer additions as well. This takes you back to an era of spiked-topped helmets, polished brass, and cavalry sabers. Uhlans, Jaegers, and all manner of soldaten march off to battle or field-drill in strict Prussian order....If your neighbors are French, Polish, or Russian, ...they might get a bit nervous if you play this CD too loudly!"
5,Beautiful Jewelry,"I first came across the Silver Insanity line of Celtic jewelry last year, when I was looking for Christmas presents. Jackpot! I confess I spent a good hour and a half looking over their featured items, both on Amazon and on the Silver Insanity website. The teardrop earrings I picked out were quite a success, so much so that I recently went back and got this lovely pair of silver Celtic knot earrings for myself. I've been very happy with my selection, and I just went to pick out some silver starburst earrings as a wedding gift for a friend. I highly recommend the items from Silver Insanity, and plan to order from them again."
2,A Gift for daughter,"Earrings look better in picture than in person. While the design is lovely, they are very thin. First time I've ever been disappointed with anything I've ordered."
1,very disappointed,"My 5 year old son bought this and we were very disappointed. It is very heavy so it's not easy for a child to hold up, etc. Also, the push button that is supposed to engage the wings did not work at all. Even my son wanted to return this item because he said it was ""too heavy""...I would not recommend especially at this price!!!!"
4,Great Halloween prop,"My 9 year old nephew really wanted to go as Aang for Halloween and since his birthday is in October I decided to buy him the costume. Unfortunately I had a bit of trouble locating a costume in his size (I found out later this costume was in high demand this year). I ended up paying for the material and supplies needed to make him one at home, but I felt he was getting jipped so I decided to buy this toy as a prop for his costume, plus I figured he could use it after Halloween for fun. He loved it and it arrived in perfect time for Halloween. It gave his costume a more authentic look. The only complaint he had was that it wasn't as long as Aang's real staff, though I didn't expect it to be. Over all it is a great product."
4,Grandson's weapon of choice,This is one of the best made toys of it's type that I've seen in quite awhile. It is made for the 7 yr old's constant use and abuse. My Grandson (and I) are very pleased with it.
2,Almost what the doctor ordered,"This book is not as witty, funny or meaningful as I thought and hoped it would be. There are a few good one-liners, but over all the book is not good. I was hoping for something along the lines of a Robert Fulghum collection, but these essays fall hopelessly short. Knowing people have purchased (and enjoyed) this book, almost makes me want to publish a collection myself."
1,Tag Heuer Alter Ego Disappointment,"I bought this very expensive watch for my wife on her birthday. She was thrilled with it until the apparently very expensive genuine reptile band broke. Yes, the leather tore at the pin, and luckily, she noticed right when it did, as opposed to when she was out in public. It dropped right on the carpet. I asked whether she wanted it replaced, and said that she had no confidence and would rather buy another watch at a jewelry store. We are retrurning it for a refund."
1,"Heavy going, poor translation, not very helpful","Since the Canon manual contains only scanty information about the functioning of the Canon Eos A2E, I was looking forward to a book that would fill in the gaps. I was very disappointed with the Magic Lantern guide, that failed to provide much factual information, had no index, and is pretty useless as a manual."
5,I give this manual a thumbs up!,"I found this book to be a great deal better than the manual that accompanied my EOS A2. It's clear, concise, easy to read, understand and a great book for the amateur or the professional. I like the way this book delved into specific areas and gave recommendations and tips for particular situations. For cameras like the EOS A2, manuals like this are essential for understanding its features and to make photography meaningful and rewarding. My only criticism would be the lack of an index. I've been involved in photography for 25 years and rate myself as an intermediate to advanced."
3,3 and 1/2 stars on first blush,"I think I've figured out the ""Unspeakable"" part. These sound like demos or backing tracks to singing or spoken word parts (some of the titles refer to poets) that never got recorded. Well, you can't fake the funk, but as has been pointed out here, it is nice to have Mr. Frisell back spreading around his electro-geek weirdness in the land where the ""inner-city"" exists. In fact, let's say you and your sweetheart are lucky enough rent a nice car and leave Oaktown behind for a weekend getaway up the coast. Have I got a soundtrack for you. This is one I am looking forward to revisiting as time goes by."
4,Very rhythmic . . . interesting,"I like this album a lot. While it's not a complete triumph like ""Gone Just Like a Train"" it does have a nice blend of tempos and is a more varied listen than was ""The Willies"" or ""The Intercontinentals."" Frisell's playing here is the most rhythmic I've heard from him since the Naked City days, although it is not nearly that noisy. This has probably the best integration of samples into what is very organic-sounding music. Hal Willner is to be commended. Those who enjoy this recording will find it similar to the excellent ""My Lab"" album by Tucker Martine and Wayne Horvitz and also featured Frisell on many tracks."
2,Doesn't work too well,Cascade is a very poor item in my opinion. Filters need to be changed very frequently Aqueon is a better product
5,Cascade 150,"Bought one some months ago for a 20 gallon long. You can see that review here... I bought the same filter for a 20 gallon high tank. Same filter, same excellent quality, same great results. I'll be ordering ANOTHER cascade filter soon, a cascade 200 for a 36 gallon tank. These filters are high quality, and GREAT bang for the buck."
3,Super Reader,"Earth is ravaged and polluted, and those living there just get by. The conditions have spawned a mutant, Gerswin. When he is tested by the crew of a ship that finally rediscovers Earth, they find out about his superhuman abilities, both physically, and mentally.Due to his immortality, he ends up working at reclaiming Earth for a long time, and is a natural leader for the project, recruiting other scavenger children and outsiders to help him."
5,Oldies but goodies,this is a great cd. i am 71 years old and would see gene autry as a youngster; this brought back great memories of the old movies. a must buy.
2,Hard to fly,"The kite is well made an very colorful, but it is very hard to fly.I bought it because it had mainly good reviews. First you need a pretty stiff wind to fly it, and if you can manage to get it high it does not fly that well at all. We have others that fly much better."
5,Fun to fly,"I got this to fly with my daughter. It's really easy to get into the air. We went out on a breezy day, and it was actually a bit too windy for the kite. It goes up with the slightest breeze and hangs nice. It's not as stable in gusty winds. We had gusts around 15-20mph which got the fabric flapping around pretty good, and made it a little difficult to control. During the calm times it was great. You can stand still and control it with one arm.It's really pretty when the sun shines through the nylon fabric. The construction is also pretty good with heavier nylon pockets for the poles.I'd say it's worth spending a few extra dollars to get a real kite over one of those cheap plastic drug store triangles. This is a great first kite which won't frustrate a child (or adult) trying to get it into the air.It came with a few hundred feet of a fairly heavy weight nylon string."
2,where's the ink,"I was excited to buy this printer for my daughter, but was disappointed that the box did not contain the usb cable or the ink cartridges. The addition of buying these items made it an over-priced piece of futility. I won't buy from this site anymore."
4,First Impressions.,"Yup, its a cheap cookware set.Not a bad one though.As other have said, the red strap in the picture is gone probably due to people burning the thing off, lol. Its been replaced with a mesh bag that hold everything nicely.Also not shown is the tool used to pick the pots off the heat. Kinda looks like a garlic press that hooks to the sides of the cookware.Will update after my first use. Planning on using it with a pocket rocket type stove.For now, fast shipping, everything in the package, cleaning instructions, and a more feasible way to hold it all compact with the mesh bag.4 stars for what its supposed to be. I rarely give out 5 stars unless its over the top fantastic, and neither should you, lol."
3,Works but...,"Totally works, light weight, but oh man scraping anything against this material feels like a chalk board. Also really for backpacking you could probably get away with less. I really should look into more collapsable stuff and utilizing my Jetboil as the cup. Make sure to only use plasticware with this thing else you'll be dodging touching the bottom like a teflon coated pan."
4,decent quality,"I will update it when i get a chance to use it in the field, every thing looks well made, bought for 72hr bug out bag"
4,Satisfy curiosity but not envision advancement,"I still think advanced physics needs advanced mathematics to explain and explore. With limited depth of mathematics in this book, even though lots of ideas can be expressed, the process is tedious. This introductory book can satisfy my curiosity but not enough to envision the potential study advancement."
3,Hopelessly dated,"In spite of being published only two years ago, this book does not make any mention of Professor Susskind's Landscape theory, the single most important advancement in string theory since anomaly cancellation was discovered. The book does a disservice to the students it is intended for, letting them think they understand string theory while depriving them of key mathematical and physical concepts, such as the Lanscape or Calabi Yau manifolds."
2,Please listen to some AMAZING music instead of this stuff...,"I picked this CD to write about because it's the #1 seller on Amazon for Bagpipes. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, people don't take this as what is going on in the Bagpipe & Drum world!!! This CD is ok for having many different Military Marches and that's about it!Please listen to some of these bands to really experience the BEST of what this awesome music can bring: Shotts and Dykehead Caledonian Pipeband, Victoria Police Pipe Band, Strathclyde Police Pipe Band, 78th Frasiers, Boghall and Bathgate, and SFU.Amazon actually sells some CD's from these bands. At least I know there is a Shotts CD.This in not a definitive list, there are many other GREAT bands.Lismor Recordings also has a series of the Actual Worlds best pipers and you can't get any better. Once you start listening to this stuff, you won't get anymore of these.. compellations."
3,"Not Bad, Not Great!","I love military and police pipe bands, and for the most part, this CD delivers the real thing. One unfortunate choice of music sounded like it was performed by ""Alvin and the Highland Chipmunks"", and has generated a lot of amusement in my office whenever it plays."
3,Good practice CD,If you want to practice with a good tempo and get examples of setting .. this is a good CD.
3,Great if you like pictures,"I bought this book at the Aerospace museum in the Honolulu International Airport just before boarding a plane. With little time to browse, I purchased it expecting it to be an interesting reference on Jumbo Jetliners, as the title would imply. Unfortunately this is primarily a picture book with very little technical information in the captions below each picture. This book would be great for one who enjoys viewing photos of planes but quite dissappointing if you expected technical reference material."
5,"Konstantine, shy little crocodile","Konstantine is a shy, timid crocodile on the outside, but bright and adventurous on the inside. The other jungle animals can only see his shyness, and tease him all the time. One day Konstantine finds a French horn and teaches himself to play it. Through his music, Konstantine discovers that he can share with others the warm personality inside of him."
5,Scrumptuous!,"This book saved my life! Had to go on a long, stressful trip to the Southwest and knew I'd need a break at the end. I found Spa Journeys in my doctor's office (of all places!) and used it to find an *incredible* spa in Arizona. It doesn't just tell if a place is good or bad; it explains how you can turn your trip into a really intense, positive, life-changing experience.I'm planning a trip to Europe this summer and will use Spa Journeys for that, too. Thanks, Linda and Annette!"
4,XM radio to go!,The Belkin XM Mobility Kit for the Xpress and Roady is recommended to anyone who wants XM radio on the go. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the battery needs to be charged every 3 to 4 hours rather than the 4 to 5 hours as advertised.
1,Nice but poor volume level,"Good reception but the volume level is very low. No way to increase it. I'm disappointed in its performance. Hopefully, the manufacturer can correct it."
2,Belkin XPRSS Battery Kit : Headphones,The portable battery works great however the headphones have a lot to be desired. Unable to hear the radio with the volume turned all the way up on the headphones. Any outside noises covers up the radio. I love my portable XM radio but wish I hadn't spent 100.00 bucks for the headphones. That cost more than the protable XM unit!!!!
1,Doesn't work,"We couldn't get this battery pack to work properly but when we went to send it back to get a refund, there was no way to figure out how to do that. Will not buy from this place again."
2,Bad connector design,"I am on my second Belkin unit like this. The connector plug between the headphones and the battery pack become faulty after a while and require all kinds of jiggling to function. First one ear, then the other ear, then skipping, then it plays backwards!! Right now I have a rubber band holding it in place. Too bad because I love the Roady unit. I use it in my vehicles, my boat, the camper, all over. Now if they could just design a good plug for the portable battery pack the world would be rosey."
2,Just too bulky,"I bought this hoping it would give me more options to listen to my radio. However the radio plus clip plus battery is just too bulky. It is too heavy to clip to a belt loop and too big to stick in a pocket. Its not practical for public transportation. I tried it a couple of times for walks around my neighborhood, but found it is just too big of a hassle. I would much rather listen on my smartphone."
2,Un-useable discomfort,"For me, the headphones supplied are painfully uncomfortable. And because they contain the antenna, you have no choice to use something else. This could have been a great product were it not for this. But it simply is unacceptable for a person with a big head like me."
1,Hard to tell,Looks like an interesting DVD - but who would know? There is no information given about the contents.
3,A lot of a little,"I think a somewhat more appropriate title for this book would be ""A Beginner's Introduction to Linux"". Basically, the book takes a sweeping overview of what you can do with Linux with a few short examples and references for more in-depth information. Indeed, he has some excellent tips and tricks, most of which are from his Magazine articles. But each subject is very short, with some being completely useless. For example, his section on Firewalls is about 4 pages long and talks about ipchains. This I can't understand. With the book being published so recent and the 2.4 kernels out for a while now, he doesn't even mention netfilter and iptables.His sense of humour prevents the book from being a dry read but at times gets rather childish and annoying. In addition, it takes away from the professionalism of the book.If I were a complete beginner, I would probably give this book 4 stars and If I were experienced, I would give it 2 stars. Thus, I settled on 3."
5,Educational and Humorous Insight into China!,"This book is compellingly entertaining and an absolute pleasure to read. Written by an expat from Canada, it will keep you learning AND laughing about the various cultural differences! Providing many useful, personal insights into the business culture, social culture, and day-to-day living in China, Sally Grattidge wends her way humorously through the frustrations and culture shocks faced by foreigners. A ""must read"" for anyone relocating to China."
2,"Enjoyed it, but then it got VERY disturbing","Yes, this book is engaging and immediately pulls you in, with its [mostly] strong characterization and its very rich details of life in 18th century Scotland. The author has done her research, and I appreciate that when it comes to historical romance. However, the last section of the book -- when Jamie is captured by a nasty English officer -- contains scenes of such graphic sexual violence that I could hardly continue reading. I put this out there as a warning to other readers who dislike reading about brutal sadism: you may want to skip this book. It's a shame, as there is so much in the book that is is lyrical and engaging and enjoyable. But the last section left me with a very, very sick taste in my mouth."
2,Could have been great !,"The general story holds great promise. The character of Jamie is delightful and appealing. Claire is self righteous and hard to like. It's not intellectual but lots of fun for the first 672 pages. Skip the ending . It really breaks the spell. At one point in the story, Jamie asks ""what is a sadist?"" Well I suppose Ms. Gabaldon thinks her readers fit this category. The sexual violence is appalling. It made me very angry and I could not bring myself to read the details after awhile. I can't believe she treated her hero with such excess. And the psychological healing was crap. I unfortunately bought the next 2 books in the series but I will not be reading them."
5,Favorite Book,"I became a fan of Diana the day I started reading this book. I have reread this three times and it keeps my interest every time. I recommend Outlander for anyone who likes good romance, adventure, and even time travel!"
4,A Bit Fantastic.,"A fast-paced, adventure filled romance. Wonderful details of life in Scotland in the 1700's. Like most romances, the hero is perfect, leaning towards deity, but the heroine is full of flaws that bring a reality to the story that will help the realist reader. My one complaint is that the trials faced, that are all eventually overcome, border on the unbelievable. This was disappointing as the historical details feel very accurate and I believe more realistic adventure would have given the book a better consistency. One warning - the descriptions of torture are very graphic. If you are looking for a lighthearted romance, look elsewhere."
5,Can't get enough of Jamie and Claire,"I love, love, love, this book and all of the books in this series. It is everything I could ever hope for in a romance novel. (yes, I consider it a romance novel!) Read this series, you will not be disappointed!"
4,"Fast, fun read even for a non-romantic.","Can't say this is genre I typically read but the mix with adventure, time travel, history and fantasy made this an enjoyable romp."
2,disappointing,"Apparently I'm in the minority, but I was really disappointed in this book. With such a promising story line, a great heroine, and such a clever setup, it should have been outstanding. But I got tired of the brutality. Does Diana Gabaldon have some fixation on physical and sexual violence? Or is this standard fare for romances? (not my genre) Seemed like Jamie was being hideously injured about every 5 pages, and the bit with the sadistic gay ancestor Jack Randall was, in my opinion, overdone to the point of absurdity. And did she ever explain the kilted ghost who stared sadly at her in 1945 or did I miss that when i was skimming it to be done with it in the end? Beat ME up instead of Jamie if I ever try to read a Gabaldon book again."
4,"loved it, but....","I really liked this book but found a few things over the top, and I am primarily a fantasy reader. Therefore over the top is my cup of tea. The scene with Claire and the wolf? I am still scratching my head. And, it seems like there was not a time where there was not some sort of crisis. At one point I caught myself saying, ""Oh come on! Get on with it already!"" But I had to remind myself not to defer to my 21st century, gotta have it now attitude.Ms. Gabaldon's writing is very vivid and haunting. A word of caution though, this book is not for the faint of heart. If you like Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel Series, you will probably love this story.I can't wait to read book 2!"
1,Bad Book,"This book is a kind of parody of fantasy, romance, and s/m. Unfortunately, the author seems to take this badly written and ridiculous story seriously. I do wonder, however, why she has 18th century Highlanders speaking Lowland Scots. She seems to have quite a following--well, there's no accounting for tastes."
3,"Lovely, but not what I expected","I had super high expectations for Outlander because of all the good reviews here, and because it topped the lists of best romance novels. I liked the book, but... I wouldn't really call it a romance so much as a historical novel with a romantic storyline. Not to sound like a super perv, but where was the sex? I don't necessarily need things to be super graphic, but since I thought this was a romance novel, I expected the sex to be sexier.On the plus side, the book is very well written and obviously impeccably researched. I just didn't get much of a sense of passion from it, so for me it fell flat. To each their own."
5,My new favorite!,"I'm only half way through but I love, love, love this book. I stay up way too late reading it. I just can't put it down. I love the characters, the descriptive writing, everything!"
4,Review,"This book was recommended by my daughter. She absolutely loved the book so I picked it up. I have to say it was a slow start and wondered if I'd keep going, but I did and glad of it. I'm absolutely absorbed by the characters, especially Jamie Fraser..all he went through in such a young life, dedicated, loving and the endurance and strength of a true VIKING and then some. Strength and courage does not even begin to describe these characters. There is so much to the book, details,emotions and characters are very well portrayed in these gripping novels."
4,"Solid story, heavy violence, amazing detail","I read this years ago and remember liking it a great deal. However, I had forgotten how violent this book is and as I've matured I find some of the more gruesome section over-wrought and over-done. The basic story is solid and so detailed, you can find yourself becoming a part of 1700's Scotland - almost smell the peat smoke and roasting meat and open sewers, almost feel the rough cut muslin skirts or soft, worn saddle leather. I chose to listen to Outlander this time via Audible download to my Blackberry and I must say, the lady reading the story was outstanding. Her accent and pronounciation was lovely.Worth reading and investing several days with, but be prepared for the heavily descriptive violence & after effects. I think this is a better book than three stars, but slightly less than four stars all told, so my final ruling is 3.75 stars. I will read book two at some point in the future most likely."
5,Outlander,I JUST KEEP READING DIANA'S BOOKS OVER AND OVER AGAIN! EVERYTIME YOU READ THEM YOU FIND SOMETHING NEW. EVERYONE SHOULD READ DIANA'S WORK AT LEAST ONCE. THEY'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO STOP! TRUELY AWSOME READING !
1,Yuck!,"I chose 1 star for this book, only because there wasn't a zero star option.In my opinion, the time travel premise of this book is simply a hackneyed device to draw the reader into a banal, unbelievable, and gratuitously violent historical romance involving a (married) heroine and another man.I found the characters shallow, inconsistent, and unbelievable. The violent, sadistic scenes had me wondering about Ms. Gabaldon background and her concept of love. She may benefit from reading some of Alice Miller's books.I plowed through the entire 800 pages, hoping that I would find at least one redeeming characteristic in this book, but I found the experience similar to watching an inexorable natural disaster.I find it frightening that so many people gave this book such high marks."
1,Just awful,"After the vicious beating of Claire by the ""hero"" Jamie, I could not pick up this book again. Good thing I stopped reading -- the reviews here suggest it only gets worse. Like other readers, I was willing to overlook the silly premise and less-than-stellar writing for a good historical love story. Unfortunately, endless descriptions of torture and sexual violence do not a love story make. Yuck -- after you finish this book, you'll need to find some real literature to get this awful story out of your head."
5,"This is a terrific series, except...","I'm thrilled with the characters of Jamie and Claire. Mostly. Was I the only one who had a lot of trouble rationalizing the beating Claire received? The only way I could continue with the book was to realize that in both the era Claire came from and the era she arrived in-this beating was STILL acceptable behavior. I was still mad for about 300 pages, while Claire got over it in under 20 pages. Hm!Oh, and some things that happened to poor Jamie in the prison...well, SOME things, it's enough to know THAT they happened, without need for the full gory details. This section of the book is upsetting enough to make me avoid recommending it to most anyone who usually enjoys light reading.Other than that, absolutely intriguing and I've already read the second book."
2,No so good,"I know this good got good reviews from everyone else, but I found it drawn out and lost interest. I listened to three fourths and could not bring myself to finish it. It was read pretty good, it was the story line that lost my interest."
5,A Truely Unique Series,"I have read and reread the Outlander series many times and am enchanted, entertained, and enthralled with the story, the history and the characters in this series. I am, as probably every woman who has ever read the books, in love with Jamie Fraser. What a guy! And Claire's story is wonderful. She is a woman who, if she were a real person, I would admire beyond belief. I don't want to add any spoilers. Their love story through the years of their life is very believable to me (probably because I want to believe it is possible) and they so whole-heartedly respect and support each other. I have come to care for the characters almost as much as I do my friends. I'm absolutely delighted to be able to carry all the books with me in my Kindle. Well done, Ms. Gabaldon, well done!!"
5,Best book I've ever read!,"This book was super. In fact I've bought every one the day they came out since Outlander. I've met Diana Gabaldon, and I enjoy a whole community of folks online who share the enjoyment at lallybroch.com I can't praise the book highly enough, and it could be hundreds of pages longer and I'd still have been captivated! You will never read anything like this....it is a genre of it's own! This woman has a talent! Enjoy!"
5,Delicious Page-Turner.,"After a slow start, Claire is finally transported back to Scotland and the real story begins. Claire falls in love with an absolute hunk of a man. You will fall in love with Jaime and you will be immediately drawn into this book. There is time travel, herblore, witchcraft, passion, violence and incredible romance. I cried, I laughed, I actually threw the book across the room at one point because I was so involved with the story. Beware there is sexual violence in this story that not everyone will be able to overlook. When you're done, do you reread it or rush to the store for the next in the series? Even the intellectuals who think romance is trash won't be able to help themselves. There is no way you won't enjoy this book."
5,A true love story,"I just loved all the adventures! Jamie is better that any prince, vampire or heroe I've ever encounter!!! His love for Claire is so intense! The new man of my dreams! Outlander is a book you just can't put down!"
4,Great book--very well written with good character development,It was somewhat slow in the beginning but then got really interesting. Loved it so much that I'm already on book 2!
5,Great Book,"great story, I'm reading the next one in the series, Love the characters, the plot and the love story. very informative of Scottland in the past. Love historical novels"
1,Wordy porn for women.,"What makes this pornography is not the presence of graphic sex scenes, but the fact that the entire novel is driven by sex and is in fact nothing but one (tiresomely) long sexual fantasy. The only interest this book held for me as a heterosexual male was the insights it afforded into the nature of female sexuality. I found it interesting how naturally a woman's fantasies turn to men of the past: dirty, violent, scar-covered men with gentle, childish hearts and lots of stamina. Aside from speculations on a few legendary beauties from the pages of history, I don't think men have many sexual fantasies set in times before indoor plumbing was prevalent or Lady Schicks were invented; whereas the plucky heroine of this tale was clearly thrown 200 years into the past for no other reason than to get lucky."
2,Didn't do it for me.,I don't see what all the hype is about this book. I barely got thru it. If they make a movie of it starring Gerard Butler then I WILL happily go and see it!!! Not my favorite read that's for sure.
2,very arduous storytelling...,"as someone who loves a long book with a slowly-unwinding story, this book just was waaaaaay too slow for me. i hung in there as long as i could, but finally put it in my garage sale after only making it half-way thru. just don't get the appeal."
5,Diana Gabaldon's My Favorite Author,"As an avid reader, I enjoy beginning with an author's first book and then reading each book, following the chronological order in which they were written. Using this process, Diana Gabaldon's skill blossoms before the reader's eyes. She has become my favorite author. I'm now buying all her books in hard back. Well worth the investment.OutlanderAn Echo in the Bone: A Novel (Outlander)Voyager (Outlander)A Breath of Snow and Ashes (Outlander)The Fiery Cross (Outlander)Drums of Autumn (Outlander)"
3,Bodice Ripper Historical Romance **SPOILER ALERT**,"This book was highly recommended by a friend. I enjoy historical novels, and this one did a good job of evoking the era correctly. However, there was too much gratuitous sex for me. I don't at all mind reading sex scenes, but one after the other, just gets old after a while. The book could have been a lot shorter if the sex scenes had been pared down. I also did not care for reading about the brutally abusive rape of a man by another man.Having said all that, I read the book to the end, and I'm going to read the next one to find out what happens. Maybe I'll have better luck as the series goes on."
1,"Soft porn trashy read, can't believe people take it seriously","SEriously one of the worse reads in years (and I read a lot, and pretty much everything). The historical, time travel component is merely a distraction for a lot of sex with no meaning for the story. If you like supermarket-like-cheap books (the ones with the embarassing covers) you will probably love this."
2,Am I the only one annoyed by this book?,The best way I can describe reading this book is like watching the movie 2012 in the sense that the main characters always marginally avoid catastrophe and come out on top. I found myself annoyed by nearly every outcome of the book and many of their actions. It felt like a teen romance novel done horribly wrong.
2,A let down,"As an avid reader I was encouraged to read this book by a friend. Unfortunately, I was so disappointed with every turn of the page that I wanted to quit the book several times. Although I thought it was well done from a historical point of view, the characters were so unbelievable at times that I never really connected to them. It's definitely not for the faint of heart with it's graphic details that, in my opinion, were not necessary for the story. After such a difficult read with the first book I choose not to continue the series. With so much hype, it was an extreme let down and I don't see why it should stand so far above other historical romances."
2,300 Pages of Story Crammed into a 600 Page Book,"A great story horribly written. Very interesting idea - heroine travels back in time 200 years - but the author just drones on and on with many pointless plot twists and then leaves several questions open. What happened to Frank? Did his history change? Why not give more detail about Geilis Duncan's background? Maybe some answers are saved for later novels, but I just couldn't bear reading more of her writing to find out.Also the author clearly does not know how to write dialogue for a male character. No 18th century Scottish warrior would talk about his feelings the way she has Jamie Fraser talk. William Wallace is rolling in his grave."
5,The Character's Steal Your Heart,"I passed by and just wanted to share my feelings about ""Outlander."" I read ""Outlander"" years ago. I was swept away and completely enchanted by the story of Claire and Jamie. The plot includes time travel, but never feels contrived. The characters are believable people with dimension. You come to know and understand their strengths and flaws. Galbaldon""s writing has a natural feel and pace that keeps you present in the time period and the plot at an interesting speed. ""Outlander"" is one of my favorite books and my all time favorite historical romance. Words cannot express my love of this book. You must experience the magic yourself. A must read."
5,Love the Series,I love the whole series. I've read them all twice and can't wait for the next one. (Jaime is the only man I'd leave my husband for.)
4,Outlander In All....,"In specifics, I was ensnared by this book and was placed into the contents. I was compelled to read whenever possible. The characters were well established and you felt as though your heart would break for them. Without giving anything away, this historical fiction was well thought out and without any doubt on my must read list. Claire is trapped within two different times. Loving two men, but one in her time and one in the past. Her decision is based upon many turn of events to choose her destiny. Given many paths she chooses her heart, which may not be the easy. However, war, corruption, and love makes this book thrilling, intoxicating, and enchanting."
4,THE BEST LOVE STORY,MY SISTER IN LAW sent it to me i am so glad she did.I just loved it it kept me riveted. The love between Jamie and Claire is so deep reaching over 2 hundred years. When Jamie took Claire to the circle of stones I nearly lost it. She was torn between her husband in 1945 and the love she felt for Jamie but that won out I was so happy for her it would be a very hard decision to make I am glad she made it not me.
1,ugh,"This book is basically full of soft-core porn scenes interspersed with corny conversations between the characters and unbelievably overly dramatic and unnecessary chivalry from the ""hero"" of the story. I was expecting more of a historical action adventure mystery story. Why do people read this smut in droves?"
2,"Great book, but. . .","The premis and stories in this were excellent. Coming from a Scottish heritage, I thoroughly enjoyed most of it except. . .I absolutely dispised the incessant erotic scenes ad nauseaum! The book would have been far better if it had been greatly toned down and much left to the readers' imagination. Far more romantic than hard core porn! Way too much graphic detail of sadistic behavior as well.Much as I would like to see what happens in the next book, I'm not going to subject my mind and my heart to this type of smut.What a pity."
5,fast pace fascinating and sexy,My husband picked her book up and started to read and he couldn't put the book down as it has to do with his home of Scotland and it held his interest with his country and his people. And he is looking forward to reading more of what Diana has written.He read the outlanders in less than 5 days between working and relaxing
5,Don't start this if you have chores to do,"DO NOT start reading Diana Gabaldon's books if you have housework or yardwork or work work to do. Once you start, you will get sucked into each 700-1000 page behemoth to the total exclusion of everything else in your life. I picked up ""Voyager"" in the Romance section of a bookstore, but it is far more than that. Not only do the main characters get married only a couple hundred pages into the book, but they stay that way, over a period of more than twenty years in the three subsequent books. Also, these books are far more historically accurate than most ""romances,"" meaning you learn the gory details of normal seventeenth century life (think chamberpots). This only makes them more absorbing. READ THESE BOOKS, but only on vacation"
5,"Outlanders is full of Romance, witch craft, history and more","This book has it all; marriage gone sour...time travel....boy meets girl...historic events...witch craft...herballore...unexpected ending. When you pick this book up youwon't want to lay it down untill your done. When you finishthe book you will wish there were more. Outlanders iswritten in dialoge, which I enjoy reading, it also makes youstop and think what if?????"
1,Another female author disguising her fantasies with HISTORY,"I read and was thoroughly happy and intrigued with the plot, characters, and story of historical time travel until... predictably, the heroine ""must"" marry the young stud of a hero. Okay... I guess I could get past that part... and then I reached the sex. It is utterly and absolutely disgusting to read an over-drawn sex scene with details that reek of the author's fantasy. I put it down there and then, I didn't even make it to the beating part other one star reviews rave about (thank god). Like the last 2 and a half books of Jean M. Auel's Earth Children series, I am assuming the entire series is just Gabaldon's sex fantasy with a Scottish hunk she dreamed about in high school. Ugh."
1,Whew! I thought it was just me.,"I thought there was something wrong with me and my inability to actually FINISH this novel. I'd pick it up every once in awhile, read a few chapters and then unceremoniously dump it back into the pile of unread 'stuff' I have laying about. After coming here and reading other one star reviews, I now know I am not crazy. This novel is bland tripe. Claire and Jamie are the most uninteresting and idiotic characters. The story drags and there doesn't seem to be any point. Claire has no redemming qualities--I could never 'get into' her persona. I now feel ok with letting this book fade away into my distant memory. I no longer feel bad about aborting. Abandon ship!"
5,Outstanding,"Very rarely, if ever, have I felt the need or the desire to re-read any novel. I have read each book in this series no less than 5 times each over the years! Ms. Gabaldon managed to pull me into the lives of her characters. She has the incredible talent of making her characters come alive, so that not only do you read her work, but you see and experience it vividly in your minds eye. Every visit to the bookstore warrants a check in with information in the hopes that a new Claire & Jamie novel has emerged!"
5,In a class by itself!,"This book is a wonderful combination of fantasy, romance, and historical fiction. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire series."
5,What a wonderful book!,"When I first received this book from one of my friends, I'll admit, I was a bit intimidated. I flipped to the back and noticed it was 600+ pages... Not being one to turn down a challenge, I immediately starting reading it. What a joyous day. Gabaldon tells the story of Claire and Jamie with such detail. I literally dreamed about these characters! I have never read another book that so completely captured my attention as those in the Outlander series. I am nearing the end of the third book, Voyager, and it's just as wonderful as the first. (No boring sequels here) And I can't begin to express how tickled I was to find that there is a fifth novel! I rue the day when I finish the Outlander series and have to revert back to my old dime store romance novels."
5,The book is good but the book on tape is just ok!,"I loved all the Diana Gabaldon books in the Outlander series. But I was really dissapointed with Outlander on tape. I think that the person reading it was good, but there were several parts of the book that were edited out in the tape version.Read the book, it is much better!"
5,Brings the era alive!,"I started reading this book and just fell in love with it. It swept me away. I've always found period pieces about this era lacking in detail, but this was fabulous. Not only is it a heart-wrenching love story (a little cheesy at times, but great), but it tells you about customs, clothing, speech, and life in 18th century Scotland. I read all of them in about 2 weeks and this one and #3 were my favorites. Don't start it unless you have the time to read it through because you won't be able to put it down."
5,Excellent Series!,I started reading this book because it was a free download. Thought the premise sounded a bit odd and not really my thing but it was free. I quickly fell in love with Jamie and Claire and devoured the remainder of the series. Can't wait for the next installment!
3,Just finished reading Outlander by Diana Gabaldon,"If you enjoy historical fiction, this is a very good read. I plan to read the next book in this series."
5,Outlander,Outlander has great characters and an unequaled description of life during that time! Can't wait for the final in the series to come out
4,outlander,"Really enjoyed this book. Diana Gabaldon is a great author !! If you enjoy time period books and if you enjoy time travel stories, you""ll enjoy this one."
4,Exciting Romance For women,This book is a romance for women. It is a fantasy story of love. It is about a twenty eight year old childless woman who is happily married to a man she is getting reacquainted with. They were separated by service in the military where she served as a nurse. Her husband is a history buff and she enjoys collecting herbs. She gets transported into a past century and both her nurse skills and her herb knowledge help her survive in a cruel but exciting time. She falls madly in lust and love with a younger Scottish man and they have a lot of very descriptive sex. It is a very physical world and she is very descriptive. The story is captivating and fascinating and the author is able to truly transport the reader.
5,Very good historical fiction,"I first saw this book for sale as an ""extra"" copy at a library. After looking at the cover description, I decided to check it out rather thank buy it. Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. I now own this book and all the others the author has written, and I will buy the next one to come out. And I don't wait for the paperback. These are books I keep coming back to, to re-read."
5,"So amazing, I couldnt put it down.","I am skeptical of romance novels and have not read one in years because i dislike mushy storylines. This book beautifully written and masterfully thought out. It was absolutely amazing how much I was drawn into the story. Given to me by my friends mother, I said I would try it. Try it?? I couldnt put it down for more than five minutes! I carried the book around with me. I havent done that since high school when i was an avid horror reader. I just can not express how wonderful and beautiful the story was and also how emotional and exciting. This is not your average romance novel."
2,Why do so many people like this book?,"I was really excited to read this book, because so many people raved about it, but i stopped after a hundred pages. It was in a word...Boring! Really a very dry book that goes on and on about obscure historical facts that nobody cares about. I also found the characters very unrealistic and hard to relate to. Claire's reaction to ending up in another century was so laid back it was absurd. She just goes along with it all, more interested in dressing Jamie's wound, then figuring out why the hell she's ended up in another century! Also i find it very hard to believe that a bunch of Scottish Warriors would decide to take along a women they found on the road, and protect her for no apparent reason. On top of all that i couldnt seem to make myself care if Jamie and Claire got together.In short, it was a serious disapointment. If you want a really great time travel romance read Jude Deveraux, A knight in shining armor or Rememberence, now those are some amazing books!"
1,Terrible Book - Disturbing,"This book had received so many positive ratings that I bought it on my kindle. If you want to read a book that will make you upset and feel dirty, then buy all means this book is for you. The Author has included a cast of spiteful and pathetic characters and weaved them into a loose plot. The spousal abuse was spine chilling but not so much as the husband telling his wife in graphic detail how he himself enjoyed being sexually abused. This book is disturbing to say the least."
1,Don't waste your time on this book,"I am of Scottish decent so I thought this would be a good read. Don't waste your time or money on this book. This is one of the few books I did not care to finish. There were some parts that were interesting but a large portion of it is filled with sex, rape and it goes on and on with details. I found it very disappointing. Maybe those who like dirty sex might find it of interest."
1,"Disgusting waste of time. Porn, Violence","This book started out ok but as it progressed it just became nothing more than violent sex. Blood and gore and than throw in some filthy sex. Can't even say it was a great love story. This couple was suppose to love each other and all they seem to want to do is hurt each other. If they were at each other than they were cutting up someone else.Dumb, foul, perverted book. Wish I could give it less than a one. Evidently this author didn't have a story to tell so she just filled this book with a bunch of violent porn and had it printed. Will NEVER read another one of her books."
1,Thinly disguise romance book,"I thought I was purchasing a fantasy book. Having read the excellent novel of R.R. Martin and Abercrombie, I couldn't have been more displease with this book. It should be listed under romance novel. Seriously, the hero doesn't event have a realistic reaction to be back in time. All she does is to stare at the men chest. The one saving grace of this book for me was the quite exhaustive research the author did upon mid-1700 medicine. Still a 100 pages in I threw in the towel and read the ending."
2,I really wish I could like this book...,"I tried really hard to get into this book.I love time travel books. I thought The Time Traveler's Wife was awesome.I could only get 1/2 way and that was a struggle.I tried to like this book but...I could not.I just do not want everyone to feel they ""should"" like this book.I can not imagine how people continue to read the many long length books in this series. Half of the first one was enough for me."
2,So Disturbing!,"(SPOILER!) I read this book a long time ago, and had forgotten the title. Friends of mine recommended it to me because I also write romantic, time-travel fiction. Just now, I was checking out other reviews because this book was on my Christmas list, and realized this was the book I HATED because of the vile and brutal male rape scene that went on and on toward the end. Before that point, I really liked it and thought it was extremely well written, which, technically, it is. Now that I realize Outlander is, indeed, the book I'd already read that disturbed me so much I wish I'd never picked it up, it is as far from my Christmas list as it can get! Don't read it unless you are a real man-hater and want to imagine a man being brutalized beyond belief. Why would a person put such a scene in a ""romance"" book? It raises my hackles just to think of it now, and I probably read it 10 years ago."
1,Outlandish,"Although I heard rave reviews about this book and the series, it was not for me. The story line(s) did not grab my attention and it was just too big of a book to spend my time reading. It was a book club pick and the very first book I did not finish for the book club discussion. It did sound a bit more interesting as I listened to the discussion, but do not plan on reading any of her books. Sorry."
2,Not Enchanted,"After having this book highly recommended by numerous friends as the best book they have ever read, I finally picked it up and snuggled in for the best read of my life. Whoa! This book is BRUTAL! I can understand how the story of Claire and handsome young Jamie could captivate a reader at first. What I don't understand is how so many people can get past the many just-in-the-nick-of-time rescues, the wife beating, the torture and the rape. The constant unnecessary brutalities ruined this book for me. Obviously, I won't be buying the many sequels."
3,Disappointed,"Reading the Outlander book before listening to the tape was my mistake. I loved the book...couldn't put it down. The best thing about the audio version was hearing the words with the lovely scotish accent. There was so much left out of the audio that was so wonderful in the book that I found myself waiting to hear stories, family arguments, love scenes, and characters that were left out all together. If there is ever an unabridged version I would recommend it 100%, but spend your money on the book not the abridged tape."
5,Ms. Gabaldon is to be commended!,"This book is the first of a series that will carry you away. Once you get into this book, it begins a journey through time and love that you will not want to end. The encompasing story of Jamie and Claire takes you through honorable moments in history and makes you feel a part of it. Diana has written with perfect historical provisions, that help you to enjoy this masterful series even more. I recomend this book to anyone who loves history, romance, and a bit of the unknown. And even if you don't like these things before you pick this book up, you'll be sure to LOVE them afterwards."
3,Outlander,"Historically, this book was fascinating. At times, I felt as if I could see 18th century Scotland through Claire's eyes. I was hooked by the premise of the story immediately. Unfortunately, by the end of the book I had so tired of Jamie's abuse at the hands of everyone that I was ready to abandon the story. I was astounded that each event of torture became worse and worse and by the end I was hoping for his demise. Exploring the psychological angle of a woman facing the dissonance of her own upbringing with that of a more repressed era for women would have strengthened this story."
3,"Book is good, but certainly not deserving of 5 stars!","I have read this book and enjoyed it as simply another romance novel. I do not feel that it is anything special. As for reading it quickly, it took me 3 weeks to read it! It was easy to put down! I admit, I have not read the sequels, but I probably will get around to them eventually. I am in no big hurry!"
3,TOTALLY OVER-RATED BY YOUR READERS,Outlander was okay and I enjoyed it....but I came nowhere near the rhapsody decribed by your reviewers! Is Gabaldon trying to take Michener's or Clancey's place in the world with the thickest books on the shelf? There was no reason for this story to have taken over 800 pages (paper back). It could have been told just as convincingly in half the pages. I'll read some of the ensuing books.
2,Good start but way too violent and unreal,"I am also one of those who got hooked in the beginning and I went through reading the first 80 pages or so in a blink. But then, I started getting bored with all the sex scenes. Then, I started getting annoyed with all the times the heroine is rescued or the hero beaten. Then I got furious and disgusted with the detailed descriptions of violence including wife beating and rape. It is a pity because it had potential. There could be so much drama in the feelings of a woman trapped in another time, away from a man she loved, bound to a man she learns how to love. Lots of historical facts show that the author has done a good research but the heroine is much too easily adapted to all. I was put off from reading the rest of the books."
1,Oh Please.......,"This is nothing more than the typical lonely housewife book. The reason I started reading it, beside it being free, was because of the reviews. I thought it had an interesting concept of stepping back in time. After reading about 40% I had to stop because it became your typical unrealistic romance book. I only read as far as I did because I thought maybe Claire and Jamie would grow tired of having sex behind rocks, in leaves, in camp with men around, by streams, etc etc etc...and get back to the story. No such luck. Deleted from Kindle and was very disappointed since reviews were so high. Oh well...on to the next."
1,Had high hopes for this but....,"I was really hoping that this book was going to be great, especially after all the rave reviews I read. I love book series, even if they are a bit fluffy. This unfortunately was beyond fluff, it was just boring. It was a slow beginning but I decided to stay with it, then it got intriguing for a while when Claire was transported back in time. After that point though it was, as another reviewer has pointed out, like a reality show where they just let the camera run to record all the minute by minute minutia of the day. I am more than half way through the book and am struggling with the decision to finish it or not waste my time and move onto something else. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
3,Romance novel meets the Perils of Pauline,"I hate to disagree with all those listed here who said that it's not a romance novel, but it is. The two main characters make love when they're happy, when they're sad, when they're angry, when they're in danger, when they escape danger, when they kill someone....and the earth always moves.The harrowing danger-and-escape sequences are well written but become repetitious in time. The sense of place and time in Scotland is well done and reinforced with considerable detail.A fun summer book if you keep your expectations reasonable."
3,Frustrating details,"Diana Gabaldon uses a wealth of well-written details in her books, which in the beginning made them very interesting and drew me into the story. However, I started noticing a number of inaccuracies that I found distracting. Little things, mostly about plants, farming, etc. - wild foods at the wrong time of year, crops planted out of season, bizarre Scottish low creeping potato vines, and 18th century baled hay (which does become a loose pile in a later book). This might sound picky, but they were numerous and just jumped out at me when I was really getting into the story, and made me wonder about the accuracy of the other details, including the Scottish history, that I am less familiar with.I also did not find Claire's reactions to be believable, or consistent.That said, I have read the first 4 books of the series and will probably read the 5th. I enjoyed most of the minor characters, and have recommended the series to a friend who reads historical romances."
5,Romance and Time Travel,"Be prepared to read the entire series, if you love romance. Diana Gabaldon breathes life into Jamie and Claire and you can't leave them on the shelf. Jump in, the water is fine. Join millions of other women from around the world who follow the love and adventures of two special characters. This is the first book of the series and it shouldn't be missed."
5,outstanding,"I highly recommend this book, one of the best books for keeping a reader hooked to the last page, everyone I've.recommended it to raves about it. you will go right out and buy all the other's in the Outlander series. IMJ."
5,My Favorite!,"Love, love, love this series. These books are so long and great, that when you're finished with one and you don't have the next to read, you miss the characters like they are old friends. i've gone back and reread several until i could find another in the series. I've heard there is going to be seventh book. i can't wait."
3,"Books great, CD...eh,,,","My wife and I began reading and listening to the series a while ago, she reading, and myself listening as I drove long hours to a distant job. I found myself puzzled more than once, wondering what happened or why the scene suddenly shifted.On comparing experiences with my wife, I found that the audio CDs had been severely edited and entire chapters expunged.I will say, on a positive note, that Geraldine James does a very credible job of reading the material she was given, using accents and expression that will delight the listener.If you buy the CD, be prepared to get the book and read the entire chapters that were not put on the disc. (Note: The cover of the CD admits that there has been ""abridgement"" and that it was ""approved"" by the author.) I can't imagine why she would do that, as it really spoiled my experience.SHAME, Ms. Gabaldon, for cheating your listeners!!"
5,Outstanding,"This book is outstanding!!! I picked up this book in July 2010 and have read the entire Outlander series 4 times. Diana Gabaldon is an awesome writer and the best at storytelling. Diana introduces Jamie and Claire in this wonderful first book in a series of well thoughtout, researched and adventureous books. I have never picked up a set of books that are so real and tell a story of a grown up relationship that goes through many hurdles and the love still endures. Jamie and Claire are two people whom you fall in love with and never want the story to end. Diana Gabladon has done an oustanding job with this book and the entire Outlander series."
3,it was ok,"it is a romance novel. it's good....but dragged a little. but, the purpose was so that u could see how the characters grow. wish there was more action. the end was the best part."
4,Great concept!,"This book started off incredibly slow and boring, but if you stick it out, you will soon find yourself in love with the characters and dying to know more. As a nurse myself, I love reading about the old ways of practicing medicine, and of course, the love story is as good as it gets!"
5,"Fantastic historical romance, I loved it!","This is the first book of the saga of Diana Gabaldon, a great historian and writer.In 1945 Claire goes to Scotland with her husband and when she is visiting an ancient stone circle she is hurled back in time to a Scotland in 1743. There she meets a hero like no other: Jamie Fraser. You will fall in love with him!I do not like fantastic books, but I loved this one. It is already several years old...but it is a must! Following this book is : Dragonfy in Amber: lovely book! and the voyager...another must."
5,What an amazing book - leaves you wanting so much more,I love this book. Diana is the greatest. She can't write the new books in this series fast enough and I certainly cannot read them fast enough. This is a romance/drama/historical novel/science fiction/fantasy novel all rolled into one. The characters of Jamie and Claire maybe the most romantic couple of all time next to Romeo and Juliet. There are at present (Jan. 2002) five books in this series and more are promised. I recommend that you read them all as soon as possible. Everyone that I have recommended these books to has loved them as much as I do and that never happens. Buy and enjoy! Diana please keep up the good work. We must have more!
2,Surprisingly uncompelling,"I love out-of-time sci-fi, but this one just didn't cut it for me. I was absolutely unconvinced by the storyline, and didn't care if the main character got together with that Scottish guy or not. I did not even finish reading the book. Wish I had gotten it at the library instead of buying it for my Kindle. Oh, well."
4,"Inhaled book, but cringe worthy parts...","I went really back and forth about how to review this book. As a lover of romantic books, this one is so good, and you get so completely absorbed in the book, that you forget where you are. However, it has some parts that are so cringe worthy that it made me hesitate recommending it. But then again, I would not have wanted to have been deprived of the immense joy of living with these characters. Especially for readers that inhale 200 page books in a day, these books are perfect to have on the nightstand because they're long, and there's several of them. I'm on the 3rd one Voyager now, and I'm so happy I continued reading regardless of the cringe worthy parts. Don't deprive yourself of the joy of reading this book, but beware that depending on how sensitive you are, some parts might make you cringe more than others...."
4,best historical fiction ever,I only need to say that Jamie Fraser is the most wonderful character ever created. Read these books and you will be madly in love. Guaranteed.
4,Great combination of the past & present!!,"The book ""Outlander"" is a fast paced book combining the present and the past. I liked the way the author switched back ands forth from the different time periods. The writer also used common sense in daeling with ""things or knowledge"" that could be applied from the present to the past.I highly recommend this book and it's sequels"
5,excellent read with engaging theme and characters! Super!,"The premises and characters of this now-series are surprising, completely engaging and well-founded historically. If one's interest is in the realm of Brittish or Scottish history, this serieswill surprise and transport you along with the primary characters into the peat-smoked rooms of history. The botanical, sociological and ethnic research tie well into the historical tapestry of which the reader is certainly a part"
1,too slow of a read for me...,Too slow of a read.. guess I'm part of a minority in finding this novel enjoyable.Couldn't get pass the first few chapters and I tried to give it a chance.
3,Would have been great at half the length,I enjoyed the book but it had way too much fluff. If the author would have eliminated some of the fluff it would have been a much better book.
1,Junk Food,"Just like a Big Mac and fries, this book is addictive but ultimately not nourishing. Excessively violent, over long, and highly homophobic, it keeps you involved without giving much back. The religious sentiments at the end also troubled me, as if Jamie experiences his own Passion of the Christ in 18th Century Scotland. The hero and heroine are beautiful, and loved by the good people and hated by the evil ones. As good a writer as Gabaldon can be, she deals in simplistic scenarios that are disturbing and ultimately dishonest."
1,"Vapid characters & rife with redundant, boring sex scenes!","This book needs ruthless editing! If I ever hear or read the words ""Oh, Jamie..."" or ""...he put his arm around my waist"" again I will most certainly cringe and may even hurl. I could not finish the darn thing, as it was excruciatingly tedious and one dimensional. I do not understand why this has gotten so many five star reviews. I find sex scenes to be perfectly acceptable and appropriate in most works, but this book is full of so many darn ridiculous and repetitive sexual encounters that I found myself feeling infuriated at the author and mostly at myself for not stopping the nonsense sooner. This book is an utter waste of resources and I will never get the time spent on it back. If you have a brain and a decent sex life, leave this tome alone....I can only surmise that the sexually frustrated and intellectually limited could find this book of any interest."
3,predictable romance,"As a lover of historical fiction I decided to give Outlander a try. I agree that it was based on a fun premise, somewhat educational, and good fun. Then it became repetitious. Get away from the bad guys, have great sex, learn more about other characters, get away from the bad guys, have great sex, learn more about other characters. Given, the characters are interesting. But the plot (or lack of) was too formulaic. And many of the sex scenes were unnecessary. Though I approached it as a piece of brain candy, I was unable to finish the last 200 pages due to its predicability and my boredom."
3,a long saga,"This book is not bad, but it takes a while to get through it. The sequals are equally lengthy. They are well written, but tend to lose steam. They are written as if the writer was actually there, which makes them interesting. If you have a week to curl up with a book and devote your week to it, this one is good. Give yourself a break between this one and the sequal."
5,THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!!!!,I loved this book and I have read it three times! I have ordered the Outlandish Companion and I am desperate to recieve it!!! I can't wait!!! I love these books if anyone else enjoyed them as much i did please recommend your other favorites :)
3,This book is a bodice-ripper romance,"I had heard wonderful things about it, and for the first couple of hundred pages, really enjoyed it. But let's face it, this is a historical romance -- great if that's what you like. I learned that I really don't like historical romances any better than I like romance novels. I quit reading about halfway through -- the book just went on and on, and after a while, the novelty of the device (time travel) seemed to have lost interest for the author, because we were totally imbedded in the earlier time period.If you love romances, this will probably be just your cup of tea. If you don't normally read romance novels, be warned."
1,Outlander is AWFUL,"I agree with everyone who gave the book one star. I give it zero stars. Next time, before spending good money on an e-book, I will read the negative reviews. Please don't subject yourself to this disgusting tripe."
2,I don't get it ...,"Besides the stupid time-travel premise:predictable set pieces;characters from type casting;slow moving;poor, repetitive writing.Why does anyone like this book enough to stay with it?"
1,Appalling,"There is so much that is woeful about this, it's quite hard to know where to start. Historical and linguistic inaccuracies to make your hair curl, crude approximations of various Scots accents scarily reminiscent of the janitor from the Simpsons (hmm, so maybe that was her inspiration!) - so far so bad.Don't, whatever you do, come near this series if you have a genuine interest in and fondness for eighteenth century Scottish/British history. Prefer endless repetitive coupling between two highly improbable main characters ? This is the series for you."
2,Yuck,This one was recommended to me by someone and has been touted as the ultimate romance. I thought it was stupid. I couldn't even finish it.
1,Awful book,"I enjoyed the first few chapters enough to ignore the badly written bits. But by halfway, it got so much worse-the sex degenerated into masochism, the characters talk soooooo much and so boringly, the extreme and unending physical and emotional trauma, could not make up for the few nice touches, the small amount of good writing.What is so astounding is that people have so fallen for this ridiculous bodice-ripper."
2,About 400 pages longer then necessary,"This book would have strongly benefited from some good editing. It was over half as long as it needed to be.I read all the glowing reviews for this book and was anxiously anticipating a story that would sweep me away into a magically place. I was sadly let down, due to the masses of dribble that the author spilled all over the place, I found myself having to skim over whole chapters because NOTHING was happening.I will say that the romance between Jamie and Claire did not let me down. There were parts of the book where I couldn't put it down, but those were few and far between. This book had so much potential; it just got drowned under unnecessary fluff."
2,Too Much Sadistic Sex Descriptions,"This story starts our very well. I was, in fact, mesmerized by the story line. But then Gabaldon begins endless descriptions of the love aspects of the two main characters. Just when I thought I could not stand it anymore things get really worse. I started wondering about this author when she descibed a belt whipping that the heroin got from the hero. Then the heroin went through the process of convincing herself that she deserved it. (NOT!). Later in the book a very detailed description is given of a homosexual torture rape, complete with knives, blood licking, and you name it. Then close to the end, to save the hero, the heroin reinacts some of the same acts on the hero. It was too much for me."
2,You lost me at domestic violence **spoilers**,"I had to read a romance for my book club. After trying two others, I stuck with this one because the writing wasn't terrible. I was okay with this book until the hero, Young Jamie, beats the crap out of the heroine, Claire, after she's almost raped by the villain. Once it got into the whole ""he did it because he loves me"" bit,"" and she decides to stay with him instead of returning to her other, non-abusive husband, I could no longer relate to this character. If domestic violence is what passes for romance, I'll stick to my Stephen King novels (wherein domestic abusers are monsters, or eaten by monsters, or both)."
2,Not my style,"I enjoy good historical fiction and found this not to be good historical fiction. While I skimmed so much oft be book because of the graphic sex and brutality, the parts I read dragged for me. I enjoy Lear ing something in a historical fiction book and the only thing I learned is this graphic romance was that I will not be reading any more of her books"
2,Overhyped book,I bought this book because I heard about how great it was and everyone kept raving about it. Boy was I disappointed. I was so bored. The book is way too long and drawn out. I cannot believe that there are several more books about these same characters. I could not get into it at all. I skimmed the end of the book. I didn't see the chemistry between Jamie and Claire. I liked Calum and his brothers' characters more than I did the hero and the heroine. To sum it up in one word BORING!
1,I don't know what other people saw in this book,"Possibly if you are 15 and still haven't read many books this book will appeal to you. I found it untterly innane and ridiculous. I do a lot of reading and usually plow through things pretty quickly but this took me over a month to get through just half, at which point I finally decided I didn't care anything about the characters so back on the bookshelf it went. I wouldn't reccommend this book to anyone."
1,I don't get it!!?,"I purchased this book because of the great reviews and the fact that it was listed as the number one romance novel of all time by readers in a Romance Reader web I was browsing through (never listening to their advice again). What a big disappointment!! It was way too long, too detail-oriented and we really didn't need the ""hero"" to go through all of that torture for us to be compassionate about him or his actions! I agree with the May 8 review by ""Anonymous"" -- I too was so disgusted toward the end of the book. I actually had nightmares! I finished the book 6 days ago and I still can't stop cringing about it!! That's not my idea of a ""feel good"" read!! Don't waste your money folks!!"
2,Outlander,"I was really disappointed by this novel, which only became exciting towards the end of its very long story. Frankly, it too long to get there to make it worth it. The heroine did not hold much interest for me, and I think that caused most of the problem. The heroine is a woman from the 1940s who travels back to Scottland during 1740s. I thought that the concept was going to be an interesting one, as I would discover two time eras pitted against each other, rather than the usual gal of modern times thrown back to earlier eras. The book let me down however, because the heroine never seemed to reflect on the differences between her time and the 1700s. Her only desire to return to the 1940s came from her love of the husband she left there, as opposed to any reflection of the modern conveniences vs the wilds of the 1700s. I do not recommend this book for those who love the juxtiposition of two different time periods in one book."
5,The Best,This is quite simply the best romance series I have ever read. The life of the story is so believeable that one actually starts thinking one is a part of the story. A *MUST* READ!
2,I don't get it....kind of.,"It took me forever to finish this book. I am the type of person who finishes every book I start, no matter what. I am not sure how long it would take if you tried to read this book in one sitting (the audio book says it is over 30 hours), but either way it's about 10 hours too long. For the length of this book, there is really no action. I like sex as much as the next person and like it in the books I read, but come on; there seemed to be so much sex between the two main characters that was so out of context that it was borderline ridiculous. I loved the concept of the book...""time travel"" during a period when it would have been technologically impossible. I realize even today it is not possible, but having time travel when TV's were not even invented yet was an excellent idea. Especially since there was no equipment involved. Even though I gave it two stars, I am going to read the next one because I love the premise. I can see why people would love this book, just not me!"
5,The people in this book are real ...,"I came across ""Outlander"" because it kept popping up in my Amazon.com recommendations, based on other books I'd reviewed. And I kept ignoring it, because I erroneously thought it looked like a bodice ripper. I finally bought it only to try out a new ebook reader - and promptly fell in love. With Jamie, yes, but mostly with a new-to-me author who created whole people, not just characters in a book.I raced through ""Outlander"" and the other five books in this series (more to come!) at breakneck speed, and when I came to the last page of the last book, I started all over in ""Outlander"" again. I've never done that with a book, not ever."
5,The Outlander,The characters are rich and carefully crafted. The author creates solid history for her primary characters and remains faithful to their development. I am completely enchanted with Claire and Jamie!
4,The start of an amazing series,"People have been recommending this author to me since high school, no joke. Well, I finally got around to reading it and they were right - it's really good and I really liked it.It's got the same richness of detail (and corresponding length) as the Philippa Gregory books, but with much more endearing characters. You'd have to be a stronger woman than me not to fall in love with Jamie Fraser.""Outlander"" took the entire length of other books - about 250 pages - to get cranking but then it was a thrill until the end. One minor annoyance with the plot: Jamie and Claire run afoul of the villain two or three times apiece. The cold-blooded side of me could only think that they could have saved themselves a lot of trouble had they taken the time to just kill the bastard at some point."
5,wonderful,Diana Garabold is one of the best authors I have ever read. She kept my intrest throughout the book. I have most of her books on my Kindle
4,WHATS THAT NOISE!!!!,"DAVINA PORTER IS EXCELLENT!!!!I absolutely loved this reading. I knew the story after multiple readings and experiencing it again in spoken word was very relaxing.The one star is left off only because via my iphone ear buds I could hear faint phone ringing, conversations, office chatter in the background of the recording. Very noticeable and sometimes distracting when trying to relax. I am sure she was in a sound proof booth but I can still hear it. A testimate to the quality of the ear buds to be sure."
3,Liked it until the last 200 pages,"I really enjoyed this book until the last 200 hundred pages, when to my suprise the story took a horrible turn. I thought I was going to be sick....the hero is raped by his captor (a man)and he seemed to enjoy it. This book is so not the type of romance I normally read (I like virign heroines and strong heros), but I thought I would give it a chance. I had even ordered the second book about half way through this one. However, once I got to the last few hundred pages I quickly cancelled my order. Seems like this author has thing for man on man sex."
1,chick sci-fi just doesn't cut it,"I promised my neighbor I would read this book, and it was torture. A little bimbo that is very easy to hate engages in polygamy by marrying a scottish highlander that is (surprise) a nice guy in a muscular rough exterior. The writing is infantile, the plot predictable, and if judged against other science fiction, really doesn't cut it. The only reason it is as famous as it is is because it is marketed towards women, who will read anything that involves a sensitive guy in a skirt. Skip it, read something better"
1,True to Life Scottish Novel - Ha!,"Well - I've read half of Outlander and I'm sorry Diana Gabaldon, but I won't be finishing it.I wondered when it was first recommended to me by an American friend, whether the author had actually spent any time in Scotland. A few pages into the book and I knew the answer - a resounding ""No""! There are many differences between the US and the UK, one of them being their different electrical switch orientation - i.e. when Claire switches the light switch down, she would have, in fact, made sure that they were in bright light and not the ambient candlelight she wished. Secondly, no Scot in their right mind would put cream in their tea!I rest my case.This is a fine book for you silly Americans but not for the Scots."
5,One of the best books I've ever read!,I loved this series... Dianan Gabladon creates a world that is engaging and so realistic I felt like I stepped back in time!! Beautiful characters and detail!!!LOVE LOVE LOVE! One of my top five favorite books!
5,Excellent,I read this series 10 years ago and decided to start up again. I knew that I wanted to own the series so I came to Amazon to check it out. I was apprehensive about buying a paperback for such a large book (over 600 pages) but I am very pleased at the quality. Diana Gabaldon is a masterful author plunging the reader into 18th century Scotland. I encourage everyone that has a sense of adventure to enjoy the ride.
4,Great Read!,"Romantic and thrilling! This book is well written and thought out. I am looking forward to continuing the series with the second book, Dragonfly in Amber!"
4,Good read,A little slow in parts but overall a great book. Love story with just enough action for those looking for it. Would definately recommend!
4,Escapist reading,"This book is really quite thin as far as historical fiction is concerned. Much of what takes place really isn't plausible, but if you are looking for escapist reading, this is it!"
4,Great series,"I tried hard NOT to like this book, as I didn't want to get involved in yet another series. But my sister insisted it was a good read. Well, it lured me in and now I'm about to purchase book #3. It's a good series. Well written, lots of great historical detail, well worth it. Plus they're nice, thick books that allow you to really get to know the characters and the plotlines. Buy it!"
5,One of the most engrossing books I've read!,"I found this to be one of the most fantastic books I've ever had the pleasure to read. Gabaldon's gift for storytelling makes these books hard to put down and makes it hard to let go of her characters. Fans of all things Celtic, and of all things romantic, will love it!"
2,A good read gone very bad.,"I love historical fiction and I really enjoyed this book until the end. There were two currents throughout the book that were troubling: torture and homosexuality. Until the end, they were easy to overlook and were not so overt as to be unpleasant. Unfortunately, they rear their ugly head and consume the end. I spent the last of the book skimming as quickly as I could in order to find out what finally happened. I liked the characters and the writing; but, because it was so graphic, I decided that that was the last book I would read from this author. So, beware."
2,Standard bodice-ripper fare,"Based on the rave reviews, I expected more than your standard bodice-ripper fare. I was disappointed. Characters and story were just OK; wild sex every 15 pages became laughable. Barely managed to finish it and rather regret wasting my time with it. Will certainly be able to resist reading any more by this author."
2,definitely NOT my kind of read,"I read Outlander for a book group. The 2-star rating I give it is only for the quality of Gabaldon's writing. This book was written by an academic with every bit of research used included, yet I can't fault her on her writing abilities and style. The content of that writing, however, leaves me with too many harsh comments about the book for this forum. Suffice to say, rape and attempted rape were used throughout the story as a gimmick. Emasculation of the lead male character is also to be found throughout. I won't be recommending this book to anyone other than current Gabaldon fans."
4,Escapist fiction at its best,"After hearing several friends and relatives rave about ""Outlander,"" I picked it up. Two pages into the book, I could understand the raves. The time travel storyline has been done before, but for the first time, at least to me, Diana Gabaldon presents it intelligently, and with a realistic, worth-rooting-for heroine like Claire Randall. Gabaldon obviously did her research, and it shows admirably without beating the reader over the head with obscure facts. The writing meanders a tiny bit, but overall ""Outlander"" will rivet your interest from beginning to end. A great start to an intriguing series!"
2,Sleep-Ez,I am three quarters through this book and I am still waiting for something to happen! Too predictable. The historical content reads like filler material between the constant boinking. It would have been interesting to read what Claire's husband Frank was feeling while she was gone. The novel wasn't what I expected. I was hoping for a bit more SciFi element to lend some mystery to the theme.Ya kin what I mean?
5,Outlander,"Great storyline, I love the back in time and romantic twist about this book!! I recommend this book for everyone to read!!"
5,Great Series,I love this series of books. Definitely start with Outlander and work your way through the rest. But heed this warning: they are very addictive!
1,Rewind and delete,"This book should be a sado-masochist's dream. A badly written bodice ripper with no likable characters, it pummels the reader with interminable length. I am definitely not sure why anyone would read the next one. This book is not historical fiction, not well-written and has no likable characters. The premise, that a woman from 1945 accidentally finds herself 200 years earlier in time because she stepped through a crack in a Druid circle rock, is interesting but never takes off. The time change is an excuse for barbarity, brutality and badly written sex scenes. Save your money and your time."
1,Don't waste your time,"I got about half way through the book and was already sick of the characters, the violence, and the shallowness of the whole story. I skimmed the rest of the way through, just to make sure it didn't get better. It didn't.I'm not going to go into a lengthy description - other 1-star voters have already done that. Just know that I'm with them and their assessments 100%."
5,THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"A friend recommended this book to me and I ordered it online not realizing that it was an 800+ page book. So, when I got it and saw its girth, I was hesitant to start it. For months it sat on my book shelf, untouched, until I finally decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did. WOW! This book was amazing! Honestly, it was the best book I have ever read in any genre. I absolutely LOVED the main characters (especially Jamie), the eloquent style of writing of this author, and the exciting, highly involved storyline (never a dull moment!). The only problem with it, and I mean the ONLY problem was that I could NOT put it down, leading to sleep deprivation. I am eagerly awaiting my order of the next book in the series, Dragonfly in Amber. I cannot wait!"
1,Not what I expected....,"I purchased Outlander about two years ago. I tried to read it on several occasions, but just couldnt, the beginning just dragged on forever. I did eventually commit myself to reading this book because of all of the great reviews I read.If I am to be honest Outlander is several hundred pages too long. The plot seemed interesting enough at first, but then it takes you into some really gory, disgusting and graphic scenes. I found the main characters lacked depth, aside from the sex there really wasn't much else they had in common.I thought that Jaime's rape scenes and the re-hashing of all the details was uncalled for. A 23 year old virgin, who gets raped and savagely brutalized all throughout the book is not my idea of a romantic hero and it is certainly not what I had in mind when I sat down to read a time travel romance.I really don't know why this book received so many great reviews, I was totally disappointed and disgusted at the end."
5,This book is Truly Ace,Five star entertainment. There is nothing more to say - I cannot improve on its brilliance. Go ahead - you will love this book.
2,I really wanted to like this book...,"...really, I did.But I think the author (and this is just my opinion...I don't have a writing degree of any kind, I'm just an avid reader) is trying WAAAAYYY to hard. I think the book could've been cut down by at least a third to tell the quality of story. It was overly wordy and at some parts I tried hard to follow where it was going but I couldn't. Again, I don't proclaim to know anything about novel writing. I think the premise is interesting but it didn't take long to get lost in the overuse of '$50 words' and descriptions so wordy and, well, over-described, that I was tired after reading it."
3,Failed to Enchant,"I purchased this book on the recommendation of a friend, and sadly, I discovered that this series is not my cup of tea. ""Outlander,"" at 800-plus pages, is a lengthy read, and if the history and lore of Scotland do not captivate you, you're in for somewhat of a dull ride. Personally, I had no problem with the violence or the sexual content of the book; the romance between the main characters does capture the reader's heart, so in that aspect, this book is a winner. However, Gabaldon and ""Outlander"" failed to capture me, so I will not be exploring this series of books further."
1,"Lurid ""Mind Porn""","0i, but I felt positively mislead by the glowing reviews. The ""heroine"" of this piece was a lobotomized facsimile of prototypical feminism with an unfathomably unexamined inner emotional life. While adaptability, resourcefulness, and steely determination are admirable qualities in a female character - esp. in a romance - Claire displays them with such a seeming lack of inner reflection and struggle that all but the most self absorbed amongst us might employ.If I was stuck on a desert island with nothing but this book as my one possession... I'd use it for kindling before I would read it again."
1,Drivel,"This book was recommended to me as a wonderful historical fiction. I read almost half of it when I realized that it was a stupid romance novel. Are you kidding me? Long, detailed descriptions of dirty, smelly, unwashed 18th century sex. Women of that time died from bladder infections, pelvic infections, etc. from the filth of the day. Hey, I love a good love story with some sexy sex, but, pleeese. Sappy, adolesent, trite, immature, stupid. I'll never get back the hours I wasted on this. To bad, so sad. If you must read a romance novel, I recommend Forever Amber. After that, you'll never need to read another romance novel. FA is the romance novel to end all romance novels."
5,I LOVE this whole series!,"I have read all of the Outlander series-- repeatedly. The first book, Outlander, is still my favorite of all of them. They have everything-- romance, sex, action and above all a GREAT storyline, attention to detail, historical accuracy and a vocabulary that does not insult my intelligence. Trust me-- if you have somehow managed to go this long without reading this book, get it now. Every single reader I have loaned this book to has either asked for the next one or started building their own Outlander libray. What are you waiting for? You won't be sorry!"
5,The book that made me pay for my first Kindle book!,"I've been reading only free books since I purchased my Kindle about a year ago. Well all that changed after reading Diana Gabaldon's Outlander. While it was free for the Kindle, it was *so great* that I was compelled to buy the next in the series! I expect I'll be buying them all at some point.Don't read the free one if you're not willing to pay for the rest of the series, because you too will not have a choice in the matter!Great book, great read, amazing writing."
1,I hate this book.,I can not get through this book. So many people seem to love it but it just is so boring to me. I am really disappointed.
2,If you love reality TV--,"The premise of this book--historical time travel could have been wonderful in the right hands. Unfortunately, this author has produced a book of sensationalistic slop. Violence and sex and more violence and sex. The many hot sex scenes are all basically alike and it's hard to imagine a person over the age of twenty finding them (one after another) interesting.I'm generously giving it two stars instead of one, because the premise of the book is good. But I suspect that this book will primarily appeal to the crowd that considers ""The Real Housewives"" of wherever to be quality TV."
3,Worth Reading,I grabbed this when it was free for Kindle since I had never read it. You have to suspend belief to enjoy this book as most elements in it are quite preposterous. I was able to do so until I read Claires cure for blood poisoning. That was ludicrous. But if extreme violence and descriptions of torture do not upset you this book is worth reading.
2,The Fiery Cross,"I have read all of Diana Gabaldon's books and looked forward to her next addition to this wonderful saga. I was so disappointed with the Fiery Cross. Diana went on and on and on with description....I think 24 hours took a couple of hundred of pages. I think our beloved author has lost her ability to move the story along. I hope she hasn't gotten caught up in an ego trip where she believes everyone is hanging on her every word and description. We need to hear a good story beyond her initial characters. They are getting on in years and their daughter and her husband need to pick up from here. I don't think Diana knows how to develop those characters enough to keep the series flowing. I was so disappointed. And I bought this book in hard cover, not wanting to miss any more time away from thecharacters I had grown to love. Diana...do not fall in love with your words...allow us to continue our love of your characters."
2,NO THANK YOU,"This book had so much potential. But, male rape and beating woman turn me off. So unless you like violence and way too much information stay away from this book. No thank you."
1,Nothing says lovin' like a slap in the face.,This novel is a load of sexist masochistic drivel. The only good thing about this book is that the pages tore quite easily and made excellent lining in my parakeet's cage.
1,Couldn't finish,"I realize I'm going to be incredibly unpopular with my comments but... I could not finish this book because I thought the first 100 pages were too boring to want to continue. Maybe it got better, I will never know. I have to agree with the reader from Washington 3/20/00 and the reader from Ohio, 11/17/99. (I'd probably find myself agreeing with others but I don't want to read all 400+ reviews.) This is one of those books you either love or hate, From the reviews I read, I really don't think there's a middle ground. I did not like it one iota. This was my second time travel only because I loved ""A Knight In Shining Armor"" by Jude Deveraux and thought this one would be as wonderful."
5,Unforgettable!,"Diana Gabaldon is one of those rare authors who not only has an unparalleled imagination, but also the gift of storytelling. I didn't read the Outlander books -- I lived them. Every event, character, and scene is described in such meticulous detail that you feel as if you are actually a part of it. Jamie and Claire are unforgettable characters, and you miss them long after you've read the last page. I've read thousands of books ranging from classics to trashy romances, but very few books left the kind of impression that the Outlands Series had. Can't wait for the next installment."
2,Not historical fiction,"I would not assign this book into the historical fiction genre. It they had a category , romantic science fiction , this book would fit into that. If you are looking for a Penman, Chadwick, Gregory type historical fiction you will be very disappointed. This has none of the research, writing skills or intensity contained in the books put out by those authors. This book is a fluff romance with the historical background interchangeable with any time period in the past or future."
2,Blah,"Heavy on the romance, light on the history. I know this book is beloved by many but it was a disappointment for me."
2,Depressing and Dissapointing,"I bought this book and the other ones in this series on my Kindle due to all the great reviews about it. Big expense and mistake. I thought this was a very long depressing book. It jumped off on so many unrelated subjects and there was no excitement and laughter just sorrow and pain. It was long and drawn out. Jamie and Claire were the only reason I kept reading and finally finished the book. With all the pain Jamie was unbelieveable his good nature all the time and recoverys. Claire was so non-chalant attitude for traveling back to those dreary hard times with no complaints by her were just not realor believable. I have read 15 time travel viking books by Ssandra Hill that were very entertainning and the time travel to 18th century Scotland trilogy Sacred Vows, Binding Vows and Redeeming Vows by Catherine Bybee which were the best I have ever read.This is one time the reviews did me wrong."
3,Worth a look,"The characters were very well written and the historical detail was great. I read the last few hundred pages in one shot... but I just couldn't get on board with the story. The whole second half seemed like a string of poorly related, but well written catastrophes (I kept waiting for it to come together). I felt conflicted the whole way through, wanting to like it but not quite able. I'm glad I read it, but decided against continuing with the series..."
5,addictive story,A little slow to start but once it gets going it's totally addictive. Can't wait to have time to read and hate putting it down. Great story and awesome characters.
5,Excellent,This is the third time I've read the book and every time it gets better and better. An excellent series.
5,"Ranks right up there with ""Gone with the Wind""!!","Quite possibly one of the best books I've read (and I've read thousands). I too, fell in love with Jamie Frasier and found myself wishing that I was Claire. I can't WAIT for her next book!!"
5,Such A Great Series!,It took me 2 chapters to really get into the book and then I couldn't stop reading. I'm already half way through the 2nd book. Looking forward to the other 5!
2,if I wanted to read a trashy romance novel.....,This is NOT science fiction/fantasy. This is a trashy romance novel! I am only 1/2 way through it & don't know if I'll make it. I can't understand all the rave reviews! The sex scenes are not all that great either. The plot is contrived. Don't waste your time if you are a true sci-fi/fantasy reader.
1,Blah,"One of the most boring books I have ever tried to read. I love reading, I love romances, but I simply could not spend any more of my time on this book. Needless to say, I dont think I will ever try to read this author's work again."
1,Booooring!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book was so boring!! I bought all three and couldn't bear to finish the last one, I tried but I just couldn't do it. Try reading ""Knight in Shining Armour"". After all, this time travel romance stuff should be fun and fanciful not drawn out, and boooring!!!!!"
3,How can the publisher at once charge $9 for an e book and disable text to speach?,"What I have read of the book so far is delightful. However the delightful sensation is curbed by the irritation that one can charge as much for an ebook as a print copy and then disable text to speach...I suppose I should not have assumed. But it just seems insane... I like most people am a busy person and if I want to finish a book that I aam excited to do so I rely on listening to parts. Its really, in my opinion, one of the only advantages to buying a kindle book. There are many to the liabrary loans...I should have just waited for the book at my liabrary. I will never make the mistake of not checking again as I refuse to give my money to a publisher petty enough to disable text to speach on an ebook they have the nerve to charge as much as a printed version."
1,Boring,"I could only make it through the first 4 chapters. I did not find the prose interesting, it was slow paced, and the heroine, was not likeable. I went back to read the one and 2 star reviews and found I did not want to read anymore. I love historical fiction but this one bored me to death. Glad I did not order the sequel, on kindle."
1,Intriging Story Hidden in Massive Porn!,"If you have ever watched HMC (Hallmark Movie Channel) and other similar bloated commercial packages you get some idea of the ""6 minutes of story then 8 commercials in a row"" until you finally give up and switch off the channel or suffer through till the end. The difference in Gabaldon's book ""Outlander"" is the commercials are sex followed by sex and more sex until you may decide it's not worth this muck trying to follow the underlying story plot.If you like adventure stories it will be hard to keep reading and not be turned off by the obsession with the horizontal interruptions before Gabaldon decides to pen a few lines of the plot.Just a thought about such things: In an adventure story you usually mentally go with the hero through his or her dangerous situations. This type of writing must appeal to the mental images of being ravaged by a sex starved partner, I suppose. Pick your poison."
2,is this the unedited version????,"I couldn't believe how poorly edited this book was. The story was told in about 300 pages, the rest is unending filler. The time travel conceit was completely superfluous, it is simply a historical romance. I liked the story well enough, but the other 350 pages? I had to keep reading to see if there was any more story. Gabaldon would intersperse about 15-20 pages of story in 30-40 pages of mind numbing dreck. Half the time I thought I was reading the 18th century equivalent of a reality show in which a camera is just sitting in a home somewhere in Scotland taking it all in, minute after minute, hour after hour."
5,Loved It,"Wow... what a great book! Flawless writing, great imagery, wonderful story. Just discovered this author, can't wait to read the rest of her books."
5,This is an OUTSTANDING series of books...,"I first read Outlander years ago and immediately checked out what other books followed! I've read every single one and can't wait to find the next one..I think I have 2 to read still!I just saw Outlander for sale at Wal-Mart and it was the only time in my life I've actually wanted to put up a note on the shelf saying what an absolutely wonderful book this is.It's hard to explain and you won't get it till you read it, but it's infectious!!"
5,Why is it 'Cross Stitch' in Australia and 'Outlander' in US?,"Thoroughly enjoyed this book - and am hunting for the rest of them. But, why was the book published in Australia as 'Cross Stitch'"
5,Better than Butter!,"An outrageously fantastic novel that will redefine the definitions of category. There are many genres stuck to this work, but it has no peers... A world unto itself. Deserves every award that a book can receive"
5,"A breathtaking novel, not to be missed.","I first came across cross stich (Outlander)which I presume is the British title for this novel about a year ago. Since then Claire and Jamie have been in my thoughts constantly, I often wonder what it would be like to be claire and how I would have coped with the life she had with jamie. I have read all four books in the series so far and they just get better and better, please, please, please can we have some more. Diana Gabaldon is one of the most inovative writers of period time travel fiction that I have ever read. So get yourself down to the nearest bookstore buy a copy, sit back and let the magic begin, because I garauntee you w'ont want it to end."
5,"It's fantastic, and I want Jamie. :)","I loved this book. I was at first wary of reading it, because I'm not much into romance novels. But after I started reading it, it sucked me in. Gabaldon does a great job of bringing the characters to life. As I was nearing the end of the book, I was regretting that I had read it so quickly; I hate when you must leave characters in a story that you love. I'm glad that this is the first in a series so that I may follow Claire on more of her journeys."
5,"The price may seem quite steep,",Yet the price seems accurate for the UNABRIDGED audio book. I believe the other reviewers are comparing the price for the abridged (aka condensed) version. Anyone wanting to get the full experience with no detail left out would get the unabridged version. If you are only interested in the main points with much of the detail left out then the cheaper abridged version is the way to go.
5,love love love this book,"i'm no fan of time travel romance ,but the minute i read the frist chapter in this book i have fell in love.the charaters in this book will make you fall in love with them.claire is the perfect herorine strong sassy smart.,james is sexy cocky fearless they share a passionate adventure together."
2,Have editors gone extinct?,"This book sure could use one.The author essentially said in an interview, with rather a lot of confidence for a beginner, ""Read three pages of my book and I'll bet you won't be able to put it down. If you do, I'll give you a dollar.""I want my dollar."
3,Know Before You Read: there is a scene of strong sexual violence and abuse in this book,"You know, I really liked this book. The characters are interesting, the plot kept me reading, the descriptions and scenery make me want to travel and experience the Scottish Highlands. However, there was a huge plot development that I wasn't prepared for: the sexually violent abuse further along in the book. Something did need to happen at that plot point. It works in one way towards the completion of Ms. Gabaldon's plot layout. However, I only think it fair to advise readers with such sensitivities that there is disturbing sexual abuse/violence in OUTLANDER. To know is to choose with truth."
5,Excellent!,"This is one of the best romance novels I have ever read. Nothing I have read since quite measures up. If you like non-cheesy romances and historical fiction, then you will love this book. The characters are so well delveloped and the historical accounts taught me quite a bit about scottish history. I fell in love with Jamie just as Claire did. I finished the last in the series this summer and still miss him. Diana Gabaldon is truly a talented writer!"
2,Loved the writing until the EXPLICIT RAPE SCENES,"The book started off slow but built up into an excellent historical romance - until you got to the rape scene of the main male character - Jamie. It was a very explicit, detailed rape that the author seems to take pleasure in writing (an ex named Jamie perhaps?) This sadistic rape leaves Jamie damaged until a random violent scene between Jamie and Claire (the heroine) that ends with him almost raping her and which magically cures him.It was vile. I am by no means a prude - I love romantic fiction in all its aspects, (Read Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series) but these scenes were extremely disturbing, especially in light of the way they were written and the way this series is presented (a historical romance).I will not be continuing with this series or with this author. I don't need to learn of the creative ways that people can hurt others sexually."
2,Very Disturbing,"I started out loving this story and found myself in love with the characters. I was recommending it to all my friends and then I got to the brutal scene with Jamie and Capt. Randall and was just sick that the story went in the direction of describing in detail one of lifes darkest acts. I have not had the courage to read on in the series because of that reason. I was disturbed for long time after reading this book. I really wanted to love it, but just couldn't do it!"
4,Bodice-Ripper Exceeds Expectations,"As a writer, I naturally read a lot. Normally I do not read romance fiction or time travel books. However, after reading a list of ""best romance fiction"" as chosen by romance writers themselves, I decided to sample some of them. I was skeptical when I came across the premise of ""Outlander"", but decided to give it a go anyway. After all, I hope people will read what I write, giving the author the benefit of judgment after the fact, not before. I was most pleasantly surprised. Not only was the history accurately portrayed, but the story was funny, interesting and captivating. While I would never rank any book with a perfect ""5"" (except of course my own!), this was a fun read. The characters are human, hilarious and haunting. The book is filled with humor and Gabaldon has a light touch that made me laugh out loud. Now I'm planning on tackling the second of the series to see if it matches the quality of the first!"
2,Dull,"I picked up this book because I was looking forward to a good science-fiction/fantasy novel set in the Scottish highlands of yore. The story took entirely too long for any real action to take place. The characters are weak. Gabaldon tries to give us descriptions of her characters to the point that we can actually feel we know them and would know how they would react. She then ruins it by having them respond in ways that do not fit with our previous knowledge. She does do a good job of transliterating the Scottish pronunciation in the appropriate accent however. The descriptions of the scenery are poor and she gives us no understanding of the whereabouts of the characters. I found the story to be uninteresting and slow to develop.Why 2 stars?:The only redeeming qualities of this book were the setting of the Scottish highlands and one decent character, that of Jamie. However, the rest of the characters and the plotline were dull and uninteresting."
5,very lovely book...,Most certainly one of the top ten books I've ever read! Didn't want the book to end... even thru 800+ pages! A lovely feel good book.
5,Outlander,"This is an excellent time travel story that takes the reader away to a bygone era in Scotland. A slow starting novel, but captivates the reader after about 100 pages into the book. I was sad when it was over!"
1,"Abuse is sickening, not sexy.","As a history buff, genealogist and anglophile, I thought the best-selling ""Outlander"" series by Diana Gabledon would be the perfect brain-candy for my bedtime reading. Au contraire. Three hundred pages into the first book the hero we've come to love (and lust after) beats his wife for disobedience. I almost threw up on one of the Public Library's most popular reads. Granted, the novel takes place in 1743. Women were property at that time, as they still are in too many places today. However, I believe that it is completely unnecessary for a modern American author to portray violence against women as acceptable behavior for a protagonist.Diana Gabaldon - you have ruined my enjoyment of your otherwise engaging novel by making domestic violence seem acceptable. Shame on you."
5,Best series I have ever read,What can I say?? Outlander is the BEST series I have ever read. Jamie and Claire are outstanding characters. I would highly recommend this series to anyone. This series for me was one that I just happened to come across while the book store one day and browsing the books looking for new interests. This was an absolute fabulous find for me. The story flows and the characters are awesome. The imagery in the book gives the reader a feeling of being in the book and the way that the main character Claire speaks in first person is great. It makes one feel as if they are Claire. Diana Gabaldon did a wonderful job writing this book and the ones that follow.
3,Where was the story going? Why wasn't it connected somehow to her husband Frank in the future?,I did like the book. But lost interest toward the last 4 chapters. The sex was excellent in areas - sometimes too much and too varied. I was wondering why she did not return to the present. Well the ending didn't seem right. But again thought the book was good.
5,Engrossing,This is my fourth purchase of this book. I buy them and give them to friends who are looking for a great read. From my 20 yr old to a 60 yr old they've all loved it and can't wait to get the next in the series. I feel like the Gabaldon fairy!
4,One of my favorites!,"I really wasn't expecting this to be a good book. I've always found that time travel romance books usually are frilly, silly, and unusually steamy. I was really enthralled with this book. I laughed, I cried, I was engrossed until the end. Diana really researched the historical information and really made these characters come alive. I really hope that someday there is a movie! I will be first in line to see it!"
4,Historical Romance with a Time Travel Twist,"I was almost talking in a Scottish accent when I finished this book. It was very well written and had some really moving parts. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, was because it was just a little bit long and drawn out. Really liked it though."
3,Violent love story,"Although the writing style is superb and the novel has every element, I can not get over the rape, wife beating, which there is no excuse that I find acceptable, and general violence that pervades the book. If I could stomach it, then I would have really enjoyed the book. But for me, it ruined the whole thing. So, if you have a tendancy to flinch at blood, don't read it in spite of the great reviews. Because I felt disturbed when I put the book down, not eager to read another. Jamie is great hero overall, but personally, after the beating Claire took and brutal sex which followed it in the story, I never forgave him no matter what he did to make up for it."
2,Way toooo long,"I was eager to read this novel as many of my friends raved about this story. Unfortunately this novel didn't live up to my expectations. It read very slow in some areas, and some of the content was unbelieveable. I couldn't believe that Clair, portrayed by the author as this strong independent woman, would put up with as much as she did. She made time travel seem like a breeze. I didn't believe her character, or Jamie's virginity, was very credible. I finished the book, hoping the story would pick up, but was left frustrated and empty. The history was interesting, but not enough for me to recommend this book or read further about these characters. Do something better with your time."
2,Not exactly riveting,"Don't get me wrong, it isn't a bad book. I guess most women would enjoy it. It allows them to justify fantasizing about another man while staying married, and in a vacation nature spot. In fact, it is the female's version of a man's - being abducted by a female alien in a spaceship. People have handed this book to me for years just gushing over it. I finally picked it up and started reading it, but I won't finish it. I just am not enthralled, and it wasn't too hard to leave on the front porch a week ago. I would rather read a Johanna Lindsey ""novel"" than just a little ""upscale"" like this with the added nature descriptions. Lindsey is shorter, to the point, totally mindless and enjoyable without all the descriptions of foliage. And, I will remember both plots about the same.Read Rebecca by D. Du Maurier or The Alienist by Caleb Carr, or the Harry Potter books. Something a little more imaginative."
1,"Interesting in spots, but with some serious problems","I read this book on a recommendation from a friend who told me that it was not a romance novel. I quickly found that statement to be inaccurate, but continued to read because I was intrigued by some aspects of the book and Jamie was a very appealing hero. Ultimately I found myself wishing that I had spent the time reading something else.I had two main problems with the book. First, I would have preferred less violence, especially violence associated with sex. I don't find rape or spousal abuse romantic. The second problem was that there were only 2 homosexual characters and they are both evil rapists. In one case it was stated straight out that the man was evil because he was gay. I found this unnecessary and really distasteful.I ceratinly won't be spending any of my limited free time reading the sequels."
2,A book desperately in need of an edit,"I tried to read this book. I got 350 pages into it before I allowed myself to give up. I have multiple friends who simply love this whole series, but I was bored out of my mind. It goes on, and on, and on, and I just don?t care about any of these people. Plus it's supposed to be set in the 18th century, but the setting seems much more medieval. The Scots were not this backwards! Most of the reviews gush about the lush detail and historical accuracy. She can't even get the clothes right. It might have made a decent 300-400 page book, but there simply wasn't enough there to carry it for 800+ pages (let alone multiple installments of 800+ pages). I?ll stick to Bernard Cornwell and Sharon Kay Penman when I want history, and Georgette Heyer when I want historical romance (all of whom are far superior writers)."
5,STILL CAN'T GET ENOUGH,"I love this book. I have read it 4 times and still love it. The characters are easy to picture, and seems so real. Claire and Jamies love sticks with you long after you have finished the books. There are times when you laugh, and cry."
4,A great book,"I admit it: the book kept me riveted to the very end! I just felt a little bad for the husband left behind, and I think that more could have been done with the time travel aspect. Very romantic."
5,Worth the (LOTS OF) Time,"I just finished the entire series and it was engaging and entertaining throughout. Gabaldon does not disappoint throughout, with her writing style, combined with character development, history and story telling.Make sure you have lots of time on your hands, because you'll want to stay up late, and read every one of the 6 books in the wonderful Outlander series.Thank God the guy at Borders told me A Breath of Snow and Ashes was the last book of the series, or I wouldn't have had any idea!"
4,very good read,"It was a good book; the author did well at combining romance, adventure, science fiction, and even a little bit of religion. The characters were well developed and the story kept my attention throughout the grueling 600+ pages. Still, I think it was a bit drawn out, some parts unnecessary. Even some details, i.e. the man-raping, had me flinching and did very well at portraying a vivid image, one that I'd rather not imagine. But overall, a good book... I'm reading the rest of them."
1,Why did I buy this book?,"I can't remember who recommended this book to me, but it must have been a trusted source because I didn't research the reviews before ordering.Bad decision.I could tell one chapter into this book that it was not for me. The concept is just strange, and it seems to focus more on the ""romance"" that happens between the characters than plot development. To be honest, I couldn't even finish the book, and instead of re-selling it or passing it on, I decided to just recycle it to save someone else from opening this horrible book."
3,"pleasant enough characters, nice story line","Claire & Jamie, the main characters, are what kept me going in this book. I can't say it's a page turner, it was pleasant enough, however not a page turner. It did have it's moments, however, after just finishing J.R. Ward's ""Black Dagger Brotherhood"", this was like putting your breaks on to go thru a school zone. I still ended up enjoying the book. The reviews we're hands down all wonderful for this series, however, I'm moving on to a different series, maybe, I'll pick it up again sometime in the future..."
5,"A ""can't put it down"" book",This was one of the best books I have ever read I couldn't even put it down. The love/hate scenes between her and Jamie could never be brought to the big screen with as much realism and emotion as they had in the book. You can not help but fall in love with both the characters. It is a must for anyone who loves time travel. Way to go Dinane you have an awsome way of capturing your characters spirit. I have read Dragon fly in Amber and The Voyager and am getting ready to start the 4th I hope it is as captivating as your others.
5,"Have never read a more touching, romantic story .",I ran across the paperback version of Outlander in the summer of 1996 by accident.I was looking for something to read while on vacation. I thought the cover sounded interesting so I got it.Today after reading all the books from the Outlander series at least twice and telling everyone I know about them I actually feel fortunate that I ran out of reading material that summer and met Jamie and Claire. I'm waiting patiently for the next one. Please hurry Diana
3,Enjoyable!,"I loved the story - adventure, history and romance - all rolled together into a great book. It's a long book, which is good when you are enjoying the story and don't want it to end. I am now reading the second book in the series."
5,Still an excellent read 20yrs later,"I have re-read the first three books in the Outlander series several times, and am still captivated by the possibility of the journey through time! The phrases 'star crossed lovers' and soul mates may go beyond the obvious. The generous use of the Scottish dialect, subtle references to technologies (from each time), and the culture of sickness,medicine, healers, and herbals is exceptional!"
5,Where have all the Scottish Lairds gone?,"I'm not really a romance novel reader, but after hearing and reading so much about this book I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did. This is a romance novel that transcends the genre: the heroine is intelligent, independent, and lovably flawed; the hero has sense of humor and an endearing vulnerability.One of the most vivid and enjoyable characters in the book is Captain ""Black Jack"" Randall; even though I hated him I found him perversely compelling. In a way he reminded me of Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter - repugnant and frightening but sexy at the same time.Get the book. Read it. Fall in love with it. You'll want to buy a copy for every woman friend you have."
2,The Outlander,"The story tends to drag a little bit. The romance scenes are a little too muted for my taste- having reading 50 Shades...I wouldn't say this is the best romance novel of all time, but it is enjoyable....sort of."
1,I guess sex (and sadism and torture?) sell...,"I was really trying to like this book. There are moments when I did...in between torrid, nearly pornographic sex scenes. I thought it might tone down after a bit...but it seems to be worsening, so I've decided to return it to the library. I will NOT in good conscience keep taking in the sadism, beatings, explicitly-described sex (something I believe to be beautifully and privately shared between husband and wife). I have a feeling that the huge tome would be streamlined considerably if the author had been able to find more solid, non-sexual material to write about.What a shame. I started off intrigued...now I'm just disgusted.Moving on to something more appetizing and edifying."
1,Braveheart???,"The books were fun for a bit. Then the discrepancies started to slip in along with the ridiculous behaviors of the characters (claire making ether....brianna slaying a buffalo?) and the bloody boring letters and details of the American Revolution, and the repetition. Jesus Marimba! Today I watched Braveheart starring Mel Gibson and, lo and behold, there was Jamie Fraser on the screen. Surprised someone hasn't sued for, well, you know, taking others material. I will not read anymore books by this ?author?."
1,Too Much Information,"So, I really loved this book right up until Claire and Jamie got married. I'll go ahead and say it--yes, I'm a prude (at least when it comes to reading about other people's sex life), so I was horrified to find that half the book is just them having sex over and over again. I tried to skip the inappropriate parts, and finish the book, but I just kept finding more disconcerting material. At one point Jamie, seeking to punish Claire for endangering his life, beats her so hard that she can barely walk. Also, while I can understand (somewhat) why she had to marry Jamie, I would at least expect her to be somewhat broken up about having to consumate the marriage...why? Because she's already married to a wonderful man named Frank, whom she seems to entirely have forgotten about. Did I mention that she almost gets raped every other page? This book is rubbish"
2,Long and Ultimately Disappointing,"There's soft-core porn tossed in -- here and there -- for just about every interest except bestiality I guess. If those scenes had been wrapped by a coherent plot with believable dialog, I would probably have found them more than merely gratuitous. After all the recommendations I really expected more. At least there're no grammatical errors but there are a number of really jarring anachronisms that tended to throw me off just as I thought I might at last really get into the story. Much is made of the idea of honor, but only for men and love is indistinguishable from violence; that's too bad. I'm not going to be moving on to the next in the series. Maybe the movie will be better."
2,Disappointed,"I had heard such great things about this series, but I am finished after the one. By, the middle of the book all I could think was, ""Really? Rape. again."" or ""You don't say, they are in mortal peril. again."" It was just too repetitive for me and I found it gorier than necessary. How many times do we have to relive in detail the various torture scenes? I didn't mind the time travel. I found the characters interesting. I like historical fiction. I like trashy romance. I like thought provoking characters and intriguing plots. But, this book just didn't do it for me. I kept getting bored with all the running for their lives and wanted more of the boring home life."

1,Trashy romance novel.,"I don't understand how people can view this book as anything more than a trashy romance novel. And not even a good one. You can't help but laugh when you read things like, ""Ride ye I will."" I am not a prude. I've read my share of trashy novels. But as far as I could tell, the only thing these two people have in common is sex. There is nothing about this that qualifies this as ""fantasy"" other than the one time traveling episode. The heroine is not particularly engaging or sympathetic. The hero is basically a savage warrior but with the sensitivity of a 21st century male. And to top it all off, I found it kind of homophobic. Why are the two gay characters in the book portrayed as rapists pushing themselves on unwilling men? The author has no ear for the Scottish dialect ... and it's irritating. Hated this book."
3,outlander,I have not read very much of this book yet but I really like the book. I like back to the future thing. A friend suggested the series and she was right. I will get the rest of the books. I read most of my books on my kindle fire.
5,"Breathtaking, but addicting...WOW!! 10 STARS...","I've been fortunate to experience different ""realities"" through many worthy books but it's been YEARS since a book impressed me as much as this one...You will be absorbed into Gabaldon's 1700's Scotland by her rich, descriptive prose allowing you to really feel the environment: the cold days, the sounds, the smells, the fears & passion. Of course, I developed a terrible infatuation with Jamie Fraser... Sheesh. I had to shake myself back to reality a few times...Not surprisingly, I proceeded to devour everything I could find on Diana Gabaldon... Now, if I could just get over the ""redhead man in kilt"" infatuation thing... Oh, yeah and I'm planning a trip to Scotland in 3 months... Not that I'm obsessed or anything...Mmmmph!"
5,Warning!,"You will become obsessed with these characters, and begin to think of them as very Real People. This book is a favorite of mine, in 20 years of reading.I have read it again and again and still find fresh insights into relationships and culture.It has everything - and is most certainly NOT a romance. There is verifiable history, adventure, intrigue, warfare and the undercurrent to all of our lives - relationships and love. You will find yourself thinking of Jamie & Claire long after turning the last page. And that makes them friends rather than characters in a novel.I've never written fan letters, never sought out an author on the web - just simply enjoyed reading and all types of books. Until this series. Outlander started an inevitable journey through all of the series, and I simply love this book.Go ahead, take the plunge and prepare to fall down a rabbit-hole into a really good read that you'll never forget."
3,Doesn't match the hype..,"I have to say I let a friend talk me into reading this very popular novel. The concept was great, the characters were vivid but the subject matter was just SOOOOOOO taboo in places I was literally offended, and I'm not easy to offend. Good book, she put a lot of research and work into it obviously, but it just wasn't ""all that""...:( I'm not into wife beating for entertainment, and I felt like it was totally unnecessary to the plot and not entertaining at all. I realize that story telling brings about some times very ugly realities of how things were or might have been. Good authors can paint morbid pictures and rise above the sordid detail to communicate effectively without shocking or violating a reasonable person's conscious, she just did not do it."
2,I wished I liked it more,"I really did like the character Jamie, but I had problems with Claire. She seemed to get over the time travel ordeal pretty quickly, which kind of lost me. She also seemed to lack vulnerability and softness which made her seem harsh and negative. I just remembered her yelling at Jamie a lot. And the tone changed too quickly for me towards the end. I suppose it was because there was romance thrown in this novel, so I really didn't expect any thing as heavy as the torture scenes. That just made me confused and I wasn't sure what I was reading anymore. Some parts seemed to drag, and I had a hard time following some of the descriptions, such as the names for the weapons and garments. It was interesting to look them up as I read though, so I learned some things. Despite some funny dialogues and interesting endeavors, I just found myself skimming through a lot of it. I don't think I'll be picking up the sequels."
5,Can't believe ANYONE wouldn't LOVE this book!,"All of Diana's books are good. -This series is Fabulous. I just can't believe anyone putting these books down! The research she puts into making all the historical info & more correct, the ""True"" love between Claire & Jamie, The adventure, the fact that every book gives a great read & makes you die for wanting of the next installment!!I sure hope Diana does more than & more. PLEASE Diana??"
5,Outlander is Outstanding!!,"After hearing so many stellar reviews about this series, I finally dug in and started the first book. Let me say I am so happy that there are 6 books to go because reading just the one has left me obsessively begging for more.With Outlander I had one of those rare reading experiences where I am spellbound throughout; when there is not a single lull in the story and at some points I am cursing my inability to read faster because I am so anxious to find out what happens next.This is a love story, an adventure story, a thriller and a tear jerker. I love the setting in old Scotland, I love the components of time travel and mystical lore, I love the main characters, Claire and Jamie, I love the elements of historical fiction and I love how everything unfolds like an epic saga complete with intrigue, betrayal and lust (a hell of a lot of lust!!!). Definitely a favorite!!Rating: 5 out of 5 starsSuggested With: Hard cider and several evenings in a row devoted to reading!"
2,It was such a letdown.,"I had heard so many good things about this book, but it was such a disappointment! The book was too long with too many absurd happenings that I found myself rolling my eyes and wanting to throw the book across the room. I do admit that there were some good parts, but overall I cannot bring myself to give it more than 2 stars. The author came across as a homophobe, and the rape scene between the men was absolutely disgusting. Just thinking about that part alone, I am tempted to rate it 1 star! Overall....Do NOT recommend!!!!"
2,Outlander,I purchased the Outlander set of books to read when I was going to be off work after surgery. I could NOT get into this book. I usually look at the reviews to see what other people think and usually a good indication of how good the book is. Unfortunately this was not the case. I love to read time travel romances but could not get through this one. Now I have the rest of the series sitting on a shelf.
4,"Very exciting, romantic, adventurous-- better than typical romance novels","A very fun read, for the following reasons:*exciting adventure*very romantic story*learn about Scotland and the Highlands*learn about the history and culture of Scots*learn about the flora and fauna of Scotland*the writing has a lot of charisma"
5,The start of an awesome series..,"~Outlander, along with the other books in the Outlander series, are top among my all time favorites!"
5,Fantastic read!,This book draws you in and won't let you back out until the very last page. I am so glad that I got in on the series now so that there are 5 more books in front of me waiting to be read!
1,You need a Pornography section because this where this book belongs,"When I first started reading the book I thought it had a great story line. Eventually the story line degraded to a mostly pornographic story line. I was totally disappointed and actually read the book on fast forward so I could finally get to the end. I love a good mystery, absolutely detest books that dwell on sexual acts."
3,disappointed,"while the book was gorgeous and everything, it was not signed. i was very upset about this since it was a gift"
2,Boring!,"ummmm....I couldn't get through the looooooong passages. So many boring parts.Had she edited a good bit out, she would've had my complete attention, b/c the plot/story itself is really, really good. She just couldn't keep my attention long enough. The interesting parts are way too far in between. If you're used to reading boring textbooks and what not, then it's something you should definitely read because the story is really good."
5,"First class fiction, history and romance","For three months the book cover put me off--I'm not the romance-fiction sort, but what a surprise when I finally settled down to it! Although there is plenty of both sex and romance, I think it is a disservice to call this book--and the others in the series ""romances"". There is solid history here; a story well-constructed, with plausible characters and dialogue. Ms. Gabaldon succeeds so well in setting the scene and dialogue I was astonished to discover she is not English and had not been to Scotland until the book had been written! (She's not a nurse, either--I am, and the medicine's good too!) Most highly recommended."
2,Disappointed!,"Something must be wrong with me!I read this book and did not like it much. I finished it, so for that reason alone I gave this two stars, but I was VERY disturbed by the end.Since this book is considered the number one romance of all time, I really expected that I would like it, but I was very disappointed."
2,Historic Fiction meets Harlequin Romance,"I love historic fiction, and this one came highly recommended... but there is just too much lust and battling to keep me engaged. It read like a cheap dime store paperback after a while..."
5,Love the series!,"This is the first book in a 6 part series. I was a little leary of it when recommended by my sister. A woman falling through a rock and landing 200 years in the past? I mean, come on!! But to my surprise it was really good. There is a lot of action and I became very attached to the characters. At the end of the book, I couldn't wait to get onto the next to see where the story would go. I'm currently on the 3rd ""Voyager"" and still loving it. I even ordered the rest of the series so I won't have to wait for the next one."
5,New Series Obsession!,"I won't write a long review of the book, since there are so many thorough reviews already posted. I went into the book with a little hesitation, because I don't enjoy romance novels. I was happily surprised that this story had so much more to offer. I'd classify it more as an epic story than a romance novel.I'm excited that I discovered the series late in the game, and there are already six books published. Now I don't have to wait for sequels to come out -- I can answer my new obsession immediately. I enjoyed the book quite a lot, and would definitely recommend it."
2,A disappointing mixture of romance and fantasy,"The book did not hold up to the expectations I had been given by other readers.History is secondary to at times steamy romance and fantasy. The writing, at least in the beginning ofthe book, is too breathy. One would have wished Ms. Gabaldon a better editor for her first book.Fantasy for sure, as it is rather unbelievable that not only her husband but also a monk believe the heroine's story of time travel at a time where witches were quickly put on the stake.All I can recommend this book for is very light summer reading."
4,Outlander Review for Outlander by Diana Gabaldin,I enjoyed the book very much. It was a beautifully sensitive love story. The plot with a 1944 post-WWII woman going back in time 200 years and falling in love with a Highland Scot gave great insight into the history and customs of that timeI can't wait to read the next book in the series. I'm glad I came to the series late so I can read the books one after another
1,Don't get it,I guess I am with the minority on this book. I was completely disappointed with it. It's nothing more than a trashy romance novel and a poorly written one to boot. I wanted to give it a fair chance so read bout 3/4 of the way through but couldn't stand it anymore. I just don't get the appeal.
2,What's under his kilt?,"A thinly disguised romance novel. I was disappointed that once the main character goes back in time to early Scotland, she stays there for a loooong time. I expected more treatment of issues of going back and forth between realities. Also, the ending was blah, beige, boring. It could have been intense, especially if the time scene had flicked back and forth more often, as her character's husband in ""present"" time is a descendent of a past enemy. What if she'd tried to get present hubby to go back with her and change things? What if, what if.... ah well...."
3,"Entertaining enough, I suppose...","...but I could have done without all the sex. I've got no problem with sex -- even with graphic descriptions of sex (which these aren't) -- but it went on and on. It was embarrassingly ""romance novel"" type stuff that distracted from the otherwise interesting bits in the book."
5,An author like this comes along only once in a lifetime!,"Never in my life have I ever been moved with so much emotion while reading a fiction story. Outlander and the other three books in this series so far, are stunning. This reading experience will repulse you, depress you, make you angry, make you laugh and make you feel sad to see it all end. Diana Gabaldon's writing style is terrific, her imagination remarkable and her storytelling unforgettable. These books definitely live up to the hype and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the books in this saga."
5,Very absorbing,"You get so drawn into the characters lives you want more when the last page is read. Then you find out ""There is more"" and you read and read and read. And you still want more, more, more."
5,"Excellent book, I couldn't put it down.",The book was a story that I didn't want to end. Luckily there are three more after it! I would recommend this love story to anyone. The history really added to the enjoyment of this book also.
4,"Not my style, but...","A friend suggested I read this book, but I had my doubts, since this is not my type of literature. Much to my surprise and chagrin, I hated putting the book down. I love the characters of Jamie and Claire, and their interaction makes me smile and at times laugh. I love the language as it is spoken in that time period. I find myself wondering what people of that time really would think of this era. I have now started the second installment and am enjoying just as much. I like this author so much, that I have started to collect her hardcover books. I have recommended this author to others, and thanks to my friend, there are three of us in the workplace reading the series."
5,Unabridged and Unequaled,"Davina Porter is amazing in her reading of this book. The variations in voices brings each character to life. If you have read the book, you'll find you've missed much. Listening to this audio book will bring a new appreciation for Diana Gabaldon's fine work."
1,Disappointing - A Chore to Finish,"Sorry, Outlander fans. This book was a huge disappointment to me. I was prepared to love it, but just getting past the first chapter was a chore. The middle of the book is o.k., but the last half of the book is way overdone. I think this is one of those books you either love or hate."
1,boring,"I remember trying to read this book years ago and couldn't get through it. I tried again on a friend's recommendation. I made it about half way through this time, but it was painfully boring again. Not worth the effort."
3,abridged,"LOVE this book... in the original paperback. The kindle version is seriously abridged, and in fact was disappointed. The first time I read the book, years ago, I turned from the last page back to the first and began reading all over again. this did not end in the same place. I'm an unhappy customer."
3,My first romance novel. . . Eh,"The first romance novel I have ever read. To be fair, the romance genre is not my cup of tea. The book itself is a historical romance where the main character, Claire Randal, touches a stone in a circle like Stonehedge and is catapulted back to the early mid 1700s. There she is forced to marry a Scotsman as she has to adapt to the new circumstances. It tends to lack any plot development after Claire decides that she will stay in Scotland with her new husband (and after she has told him her unique situation). It is most interesting when it tries to portray the different expectations in the relationships between men and women (18th century views vs 20th century). All in all, I was not too thrilled."
2,Outlander and a big bags of chips,"Wondering what they have in common? Quiet simply, both are junk food; one for your brain and the other for your body. You can't put either of them down and you know you'll regret both for days.I like a good romance too, but the fact that this is being heralded as anything but a highly entertaining Harlequin Romance is disheartening. Didn't it bug anyone else that the two main characters, Claire and Jamie, seem to be flawless individuals? OOPS sorry. They DO have flaws... by their own omission they are too loyal, too stubborn, slightly vain and generously gallant to a fault (Oh Jamie! How could you!?). Geesh!"
1,"Trite, banal, ill-plotted, disappointing",I finished this book merely to see if it got any better--it didn't
1,Rubbish,What a load of rubbish. Reading this book was a total waste of time. Both protagonists were not very likeable. The violence against one of the main character is despicable and totally unnecessary. I'm only writing this to warn others not to read this book. I would give this book 0 stars if I could. If you like time traveling read 'Knights In Shining Armour Instead'.
1,how can the violence be overlooked by so many??,"I actually read the fourth book in the series - Drums of Autumn - first, because I was flying through my reading material and my husband had this one sitting on the shelf. LOVED it! I went to the library and found the series started here. WANTED to love it...It's all been said, so I won't go into detail about all the pros and cons of the writing, era, genre. Any enjoyment is greatly outweighed by the graphic violence. As someone else said, I wish I'd read reviews before I let these images loose in my head. Specifically, I agree with all the negative comments about the final seen between hero and antagonist; the intimate details of the anal rape were a lot more than I needed. If I could poor bleach in my ear and scrub out the second half of this book, I would."
1,too much smutt,"not a good story at all. i had a friend recommend it, but it was very cheesy and would not recommend it to any one else."
1,Disappointed.,"Being of Scottish heritage, I was excited to read this book. It's true that most who have read it RAVE about it. It started off well - I especially enjoyed the historical and topographic information about Scotland, and the descriptions of 18th century Scottish clan life later in the book. That's about it. I found the ""sexploits"" of our two ""heros"" often violent, and eventually just damned monotonous! I was appalled by the wife-beating incident, and even more so when Claire seemed to accept its occurrence as normal. And was it really necessary to make Black Jack Randall both evil and gay? The author is truly a woman of the 1950's. I also found ludicrous the monk's reasoning as to why Claire's simultaneous marriage to two men was not bigamous and was compatible with the Church's teachings? Because her second husband preexisted her first? Give me a break."
3,Outlander Series,A little too far fetched for my taste. It had been highly recommended and so I thought I would try it.
4,"I've read it before, but 'listening' was so much better!","I read this whole serious a long time ago (15 - 20 yrs) and really enjoyed it, so decided to get the audio book and I can tell you I was as enthralled with it this time round as I was all those years ago and I plan to get the whole serious in audio."
5,Now this is romance!,"I have never given a review before. However, after reading Outlander and the rest of Diana Gabaldon's series; I just had to comment on how wonderful these books were. From what I understand, she is a fiction writer but has captured romance better than any romance writer's other works. The books are loaded with love, laughter, action; you name it, it's in there. It was a very emotional read. If there were Oscars for romance novel writing, here's your winner."
5,Gabaldon is the gold standard!,"I was one of the first fans of the Oulander series,and as a bookseller, I have been able to hand sell more copies of this title than any other. Not only that, but I have recommended it to my fellow booksellers, and they have been equally enthusiastic in their recommendations. OUTLANDER and its sequals are true originals -- defining the Time Travel genre. All others pale in comparison. For romance, adventure, mysticism, and sheer escape, I cannot think of better companions than Jamie and Clare."
4,Not your average Romance,"Outlander was a wonderful leisurely read, it is much more than a standard romance novel. I picked it up partly due to the customer reviews, and found myself completely engaged in Claire's trials. Jamie is a terrific hero, and I can't wait to read more about him and Claire in the sequels.However, I did find the last quarter of the book to be somewhat slow, and I thought the final torturing of Jamie to be extremely disturbing, and even unneccessary. How many times can the man be tortured in one book! Hopefully there will be no more torture scenes in the sequels."
5,just great,outlander was given to me by a friend who said that i should read it on the plane. i do not read romance books but she told me it was worth it. i picked it up feeling a little lost in a new land. it only took three days to finish it. i then passed it to a friend. we talk about the book when we see each other. i am curently waiting the arrival of the sequal. this book has been passed all around. it was great.
1,Waste of time and energy,"There are many sexual scenes that I was not prepared for (between man and woman, man and man, and molestation), so I was emotionally spent while trying to get through the book. I'm disappointed that I spent time reading this book only to be left with horrid memories of the scenes that were included. Not a fun romance, like others have said. I wish I knew that before reading. Not recommended at all."
2,Outlander,"Oi vey ! I just finished the book, granted I wanted to continue to read to finish the story. It gets into a lot of homosexual violence, beatings, abuse etc. Really ? I dont need to read about that in a romance novel. The descriptions of the abuse doesnt need to be spelled out as it is. We GET THE PICTURE. No detail needed. We understand what Jamie went thru, we get it. Randall was a cruel character, I dont think we needed to go any further then that."
2,So Disapointed,"This was such a great story that was lost in an over abundance of needless information. If you enjoy stories that give you every little detail of every little thing then this is for you. Other wise it is a job to read. While the story line it self is a good one and could be enjoyable,it wasn't. If it were kept simple and to the story, I would have loved it. As it is it wouldn't be my first recommendation of something to read."
5,Entranced,"There's not much more I could add to the endless praises of Outlander. Gabaldon, as a storyteller, is exceptional. She drops tidbits throughout the pages that get picked up later and in her other books.If you got ""bored"" her books, its probably because you could not hold more than one tiny little thought at a time in your pea-sized brain. You have to pay attention to even the slightest of details, as each will be expanded upon later as the stories unfold.Embarrassingly enough, I find myself daydreaming about the characters."
5,Outlander is so riveting that I could hardly stop reading!!!,"I feel that this book fulfills all of the wanderlust and sense of adventure that brings out therestlessness in all of us. Toanyone who has a Scottish heritage, it will bring alot ofhome to you. This best actionthat I have read in years!!!!!!"
5,"literature quality writing, best in the outlander series.","Outlander is one of the best books I have read in a long time. As a bookseller myself, I read many different types of books to recommend to my customers and this is always a favorite of mine for women OR men. My husband has read the whole series two times and loves them. It really spices up the home life"
4,Great read!,"A good start to the Outlander series. I was a little overwhemed by the length of her books in this series, but moved forward anyway and I am glad that I did. It wasn't the first book that got me hooked on the series, it was her second in the series, Dragonfly in Amber. Finished all six in the series and I am now anxiously awaiting the seventh book in this series to be released in September 2009."
5,My favorite series EVER!!,I can't imagine how someone couldn't love these books. You get so invested in the characters. They're like the best friends I've never actually met.
3,Book,"Interesting book, but drawn out, could have been shorter. Haven't decided whether I will read another. Your review methods are too demanding/"
5,Love this Series,"This is my favorite read this year on my Nook. It's full of everything....love, adventure, mysticism, drama, intrigue and sex. I'm on the six book in the seven book series."
5,Excellent,"It was an extremely long read but we'll worth it. You never quite new where she was going with it, especially given that she had had so many pages to fill."
5,5500+ pages later...still in LOVE,"This book is phenomenal, the entire series is so captivating. I have read a lot of the negative feedback to question myself as to why I do not have these same feelings about the book. As to the sexual content of the book. It is romance set in the 1700's..it is far from smutty. Those who find it smutty and vulgar need to read some real smut so they will know the difference. Diana G does not hold back. She in detail describes what can and I am sure did occur in the Highlands of Scottland hundreds of years ago. Rape and murder were reality. Did these readers not watch Braveheart?? Anyway I have read all 6 novels and am TRULY AMAZED that an author can write close to 6000 pages about 2 central characters and make the last 10 pages of the 6th book as wonderful as the 1st book. I cannot wait for the 7th book to come out!!"
2,Beware...,"I read this book months ago, but I couldn't bear to think about it long enough to write a review. Even now, it's hard, so here's the short version:I loved this book for the first half, and even longer (subtracting a little heavy-handedness, no pun intended, on Jamie's part). It was well on its way to becoming one of my favorite books of all time. ...Until I got to the end.***Spoiler alert***The sexual and physical torture of Jamie by another man was absolutely horrifying. It made me sick with rage. I could not comprehend how the author could do that to him. And the detail she went into...my heavens! Ughhhhh!!! Needless to say, I can't forgive Diana Gabaldon for doing that to Jamie. I'll certainly never read another one of her books, ever again."
3,"Exciting, but....","I read ""Outlander"" years ago, and found it exciting and ""unputdownable.""Nevertheless, I was annoyed by the unrealistic reactions of the 18th century Scots to Claire--her dress and her speech. How would we react if someone from 200 years in the future appeared among us, even though we have speculated about time travel?I have yet to read ""The Fiery Cross,"" mainly because of the bad reviews. Being a snobbish Europhile, I was disappointed when the series moved to the American colonies."
2,Too long-winded in length and verbage,"As an avid reader of historical-romantic fiction, I checked this book out of the library because I had read many of the 5-star reviews written by other readers. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. This book would have captured my interest, and would have still been a wonderful storyline, if it were half the length. I have no desire whatsoever to read the sequels for the same reason."
2,A bunch of boarish nonsense!,"Excuse my one line summary, this novel started out alright, had me interested, but then I just got bored! This was me reading this book : interesting, boring, boring, interesting, boring, boring...Basically not enough interesting parts to keep me fascinated! I liked Claire, at first, but now she just seems like a Ninny! And Jamie, oh, baby you are hot, let's make love 24/7! As if, god they couldn't keep their hands off each other for 5 pages! Sex scenes are amusing at first but after awhile : GIVE IT UP! I would have gone back to Frank, would have left the first chance I got! I will read the rest of the books in these series but if I find myself bored to death don't be surprised! And Diana Gabaldon, you may not have intended for this to be a sappy romance but IT IS!!!"
2,Wasn't What I Expected,"Since this author's books have topped so many best sellers' lists, I decided that all those readers couldn't be wrong and bought the first three books in the series. Now I know not to make assumptions about a book's quality based upon the number of copies sold. I was expecting a time-travel story, not a romance novel with a thin veneer of history. If you like books with sordid sex -- most of it improbable and bordering on S&M -- than this book is for you, but don't pick it up expecting a gripping time-travel story like ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" or an intriguing political tale like the best works of historical fiction."
5,Outlander Series,"Wonderful series! I enjoyed each of the books, although some more than others. Characters are well developed, entertaining and fairly consistent between the books in the series. Absolutely bummed when I finished this last book... she left me wanting more. I guess that's close to a perfect series."
2,Romance masquerading as history,"Omit the steamy and repetitive sex scenes in this book, and it would shrink from 600-plus pages to 200, and then might be readable. I only continued reading because I wanted to find out if there were other 20th century people tranported back to this only-in-the-author's-imagination 18th century Scotland. The last section, with Jamie's rape and subsequent rebirth, thanks to Claire's psychological sexual torture, rang false and offensive."
1,Sorry friends this book is not for me.,"This book was recommended to me by women, I like and admire. I read a lot of it, did not like it but persevered to see what I was missing. This is not historical fiction. It is a romance novel, lots of soft porn and violence, contrived to fit a period in the history of Scotland - and it is very contrived. If you want the sexy romance stuff alone, this may be for you. But if you want good historical fiction, run away before you pick up this book. Cannot imagine that this is a series, I couldn't make it through the first book."
5,the best romance novel,"I love historical romance and this is the best I've ever read. You'll want to travel to Scotland after reading this book, I guarantee it. The story of Jaimie, the Scottish highlander of the 1700s, and Claire, the nurse who accidently travels back in time from the 1940s, is unforgetable. One of my favorite books ever."
5,OUTLANDER a novel on CD by Diana Gabaldon,"This is the start of the best series of books I have ever listened to.It is very long, but keeps you wanting more. There is always tons of action, love, sex and humor. I highly recomend it for men and women."
4,Worth the read.,"Yes, it is a long book AND there is a LOT of history which may be good for some people but for me I don't necessarily care for all that. Regardless, this is a great book! Force yourself to get through the first few chapters (which do drag a bit) and then you won't be able to put it down! What an adventure! I loved it."
5,AWESOME STORY!,"I read the whole series right straight through (the last book came out just as I finished the the second to last) WOW!! Romance, fantasy, and adventure all come together in this spellbinding tale. Always a fan of great work that is well researched!"
5,THIS IS A MUST READ FOR NON-STOP READING!!,"I love to get lost in books. This book was like an addiction!! Diana Gabaldon is absolutely amazing, and I will spend any amount of money to keep reading her adventures. I have bought every one of her books from the Outlander series, and I am telling you, you will honestly believe that you are a bonafide Scottish person from reading this book. I have introduced this book to my best friend, and she went absolutely nuts reading it!! All I can say is, this book is addicting!"
4,I couldn't put it down once I started reading it.,"I brought this book along for a flight to the West Coast. I couldn't put the book down. The flight lasted five hours but it seemed we'd just gone wheels up when it was time to land. I think Jamie is a real man's man. He's masculine but also kind. That's a real man to me. Fin was also interesting. He wasn't the man that Jamie was, but Fin was man enough to 'fess up to what he did. I liked this book!"
3,Crossroads 1969,it was different. I had a problem with the grammar. it started out great but than it fell so I didn't care for it.
1,Can I give no stars?,"I should have run the other way.the formatting looks like a kindergartener did it. the excuse for an author probably got a bunch of drunks and paid them for all the good reviews. all that glitters isn't topaz, in this case it ain't even tinfoil. I think the fool that put this together thought he writing ethnic or something. the dialogue is just plaqin insulting.this is a real diasappointment of a Sophomoreic level. It's time for the New York publishers to put an end to where any retard can think he is Shakespear."
4,Crossroads: 1969 (Cassell Faction Trilogy),"An interesting look back to a time when big change was happening. Many of us can relate to this period of time, and his story touches many hearts and souls."
5,hover chopper is neat!!,"ok, this is a great motorcycle, i got this the other day and it's really cool like the space cycle only blue.you can put the brakes down and the wheels split apart and it hovers only there's no button to make it hover you have to pick it up and make it hover. anyway it's a blue AND silvery color and it has a missile in the front the same way the space cycle does. And one turtle rides it just like the other motorcycles."
1,melrose place the fifth season vol 1,I Cannot watch it in australia as it is the wrong region code for the dvd players that i have here.. i have sent back a return form & have emailed u on what address i have to return it to but have no reply.. i am happy to pay the postage but it is of no use to me as i cannot watch it
2,FINALLY!,"I was getting scared that they DID abandon the series and stopped releasing Seasons on DVD!They WERE coming out simultaneously with 90210,then Season 4 or 5 of 90210 came out-and no Melrose....And the last Melrose packaging got a little less ""boxset-ish""...I was hoping that if they abandoned releasing Seasons,that they would just release The Complete Series for an affordable price,ie:Knight Rider,News Radio,I Love Lucy,I DReam Of Jeannie,etc...I mean there's only 2 Seasons left...just release them,and don't make as many!I know MADTV got ""left in the dust"" with getting Seasons released on DVD-Season 1 came out,and then like a year later a lousy Best of Seasons 8,9,& 10 was released...and you can get Season 13 on iTUNES?That's it!I want the Will Sasso Seasons!Anyways....off subject!I'm just glad to see Season 5 of Melrose is FINALLY coming-even though it's split up,I'll still buy it!"
3,Finally,I haven't seen these episodes in years but why do they insist on splitting the seasons up but they still charge the same price for a volume as a season. I say somebody is greedy!!
5,Season 5 is great!!,"Season 5, Volume 1, of MP is one the best thus far. I hope more people will start buying these DVDs so the rest of the seasons will be released.Amanda is finally back to her old self. She did lose her way last season, but she is back in full force and we missed her!Jane deals with quite a bit this season. Richard doesn't die and comes back for her and Syd. Jake and Allison hook up and Jane starts stalking them and acting crazy. Jane also found out she was adopted (Syd is her parents ""real"" kid) and she finds her birth mother. Overall, Jane's story this season was a little annoying, so when she left to go make a fresh start, it was sort of a sigh of relief.I won't get into everything on here, but love season 5 so far. I hope volume 2 isn't too far behind."
3,Seasons will come with new series.,They will propably step up the releases of Melrose Place and finish the series when the new updated series runs in the fall.
2,Sometimes funny but mostly boring,This movie is a waste of time. The funny moments are far too few in between boring segments. Overall can't think of a different description than big waste of time.
2,..............,"o.. dear.. yall i hope she dont look like them UGLY pics that amazon.com has here, because wow THEY SOOO UGLY!! u have to admit. i wouldnt lie about this, if they were pretty i would say so. my sis has a my scene barbie and shes alrite. but WOW. it hurts to look at those pics. eww... sorry guys. i jus hope for those who are gonna get her or have her that she looks NOTHING like those pics o_O i have to say the clothes are nice from the pics tho."

1,"dude,","Dude, all I was saying is that she has gross and ugly hair... my god...and no, i'm gonna stay. and YOU can't make me leave!-zoe"

1,"Wow, different hairstyles. Big deal.","I hate My Scene dolls. They are the ugliest dolls on the face of the earth. And so what, there heads come off. Who cares. I like doing my Bratz dolls hair without having to swich their heads. I like to practice with their hair. And I love doing hair besides not even able to do it. Bratz are better anyways.

2,Vision card advertised but it is previous version beware,"I think the Amazon sellers are confusing g2 Blue chart cards with the new g2 Blue chart Vision cards for the 400/500 Garmin gps chartplotters (with or without fishfinder). These new models must have Vision cards with a ""V"" in the model number. The new vision cards are close to $300."
1,Not as represented,"This chart arrived on a Sandisk mini card with adapter, not a Garmin data card. Something fishy? Returned with little trouble. Something seemed off on this deal."
4,A Voice Like A Caress,"This is Vocalion's second volume devoted to Elsie Carlisle; the first was centred in the early thirties, and this moves forward to take in the end of that decade. Thus it mainly features recordings she made for the Rex label, with Jay Wilbur directing the studio orchestra.Her range covered not only sentimental ballads, torch songs and cabaret material, but could also embrace risqué lyrics. All were delivered in a sweet transparent voice, which fell on the listener like a caress, and the excellence of the remastering enables every nuance to be appreciated. If I had to find fault it would be that she was wasted on the inanities of ""The Hut-Hut Song"", and that she sounds surprisingly lack-lustre in ""With My Eyes Wide Open I'm Dreaming"". Otherwise this is a delightful compendium which should be snapped up whilst it's available."
1,Caution Before Buying,"The article itself is acceptable but I only rated the item at one star because of the misinformation provided in the product details. Please note this caveat before you purchase this article. The actual length of the article is only two pages (the other 3 pages are a cover sheet and reprint purchasing info. The second aspect that is problematic is that no full bibliographic citation is provided for the item so I would hesitate before quoting it in an article. Finally, the date on this item is actually 1998, not May 2007 as suggested in the product detail above.This is truly bad practice on the part of both the publisher and Amazon. Had they been more forthcoming with the facts, I would have rethought the purchase and I doubt I'll purchase anything from Amazon this way again."
4,Owner - Pronto Printing Service,"I own this calendar. It is beautifully illustrated and worth owning. I purchased it at one of my favorite book store in Chicago. I haven't had a chance to go back and purchase the 2009 Tuschen calendar, but first chance I get I will. Unfortunetly I woukd like to purchase it from amazon, but doesn't seen available?."
3,(Just) a Good Reference,"If you think this book will guide you throughout several projects, learning while building something, choose another title. This a textbook, and a good one. A good reference, with activities to acquire/develop your knowledge about Music and ICT.Enjoy, but be sure it is want you are looking for."
1,"Great songs, poor quality","This collection of songs sung by the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, as well as Sarah Makem, the Clancy children, and Peg and Bobby Clancy, has the potential to be one terrific CD (and how lovely to hear Peg Clancy's clear, pure voice!). It includes many of the favorites from the Clancy and Makem repetoire. However, the poor quality of this CD makes it impossible to enjoy. The recording is so inconsistent that at a normal volume level, the boisterous songs are simply overwhelming, and the lovely softer songs are all but inaudible, which makes for a frustrating listening experience, to say the least. I'd recommend skipping this CD in favor of the many other excellent recordings by this ever-popular group."
2,Poor Quality - Poor Price,"The sound quality on this CD leaves a lot ot be desired; the audio is very inconsistant. I found I had to turn the volume up on some of the cuts then down on others. The songs are great traditional Clancy Bros.; however the CD is missing the spark and livelyness that I have come to expect from the Clancy Brothers. I could also quote my previous review of ""Home To Ireland: 28 Irish Favorites"" since this is exactly the same CD. This one is, however, at a higher price. If you must have this one to fill out your collection, I suggest you buy the ""Home To Ireland: 28 Irish Favorites"" since it has all the same cuts, and I believe IS the same recording. At least that one is a bit less expensive."
2,Best of Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem,The volume of the songs is variable such that you have to constantly change the volume to listen. This ruins the effect of songs.
2,Sun mountain speed cart flat tire issues,A good cart if you can keep the tires inflated. A completely useless and frustrating cart if the tires go flat (which they do all the time). They acknowledge the problem but offer only a solution which involves buying a $50 set of foam filled tires. Why don't they put reliable run flats on the cart in the first place if they can't find a supplier for reliable inner tubes. I resent sun mountain for all the grief they have heaped on otherwise pleasant golf outings. They will send you some free inner tubes that go flat within a short while. Also the valves for putting air in the tires are almost impossible to connect the pump to. A simple right angle converter would solve this problem but apparently the engineers at SM don't play golf or use their own carts. Do not buy this item until they solve the flat tire issue. It will drive you nuts.
2,elcie,I have had 2 sun mountain carts for several years and have had extreme dificulty inflating the tires every time that I needed to. I wrote to the company and they replied that I would have to buy a 2 kits(1 for each cart) to fix this problem and it would cost me $104 total to fix it. I would not recommend buying this cart until they get the problem with the inflatable wheels fixed or it will cost you $52 per cart for you to fix their design problem.
3,"Overall a good product, but with some flaws","I've owned the Sun Mountain Speed Cart for three years now. It's seen major use all three years and like others have said, the tires going flat is the most irritating thing about it. However, pulling out the pump and inflating the tires isn't that big of a deal but it shouldn't have to be done every couple weeks. The other minor bug is that my cart pulls to the right quite a bit and the hand brake needs adjusting often. I probably would go with a Clic-Gear next time, but I've gotten my money's worth on the Sun Mountain cart so don't feel too bad."
3,sigh...good but bad at the same time,This is the SECOND time i bought this straightner i knew it was going to mess up because of the reviews i had already read but the first worked so good that i had to buy a second one (and another for a friend)...this last one i got gets stuck when i squeeze it so i have to open it manually to put another strand of hair in..its kinda annoying but i cant get over the fact of how fast and straight it gets my hair...sooo its a love hate relationship lol :)
5,Great Tween/Teen Read,"I'm buying this book for my 13 year-old daughter, as I read it in middle school. I think the book is excellent for that age group, and yes I remember crying in my room when the girl committed suicide. I think the negative critics are not placing themselves the right mentality to appreciate the book. As an adult, sure I could complain about the lack of depth, but as a tween/teen I would (and did) love the book. I still remember the book, and I read it in the early 90's, great book."
4,COol!,"I read this book in I think it was the 7th grade, and it's pretty good. It's about a book kids have at school and you pass it around to everyone and write annonymous good or bad comments about each other, it's a pretty cool book."
2,This is almost what I thought I was getting.,I expected used so it having some rips and wrinkles is fine. What I did not like is that it did not have all of the pages. The description did not mention anything about missing pages so I felt a little ripped off. It came quickly but I just thought that giving me less than all of the pages and not mentioning it was not right.
5,I Just Love It!,"I got this onion cutter for new years, at first i didnt know if i will ever use it, i have some good Kershaw Knives in my kitchen and why should i use this.But, now that i learned how to use it, (cut the onion in half - than give it one good push down) i must say i love using the Alligator!The best of all, i think the name Onion Cutter is wrong, i started using it for all my vegatable salads - and my guest never belive me that they are from my kitchen ""are you sure you didnt buy these vegatables?""I just love it."
2,good for coleslaw only,"I got both ""Alligator"" and ""Nicer Dicer"" The Alligator was a poor product it doesn't cut fine herbs like cilantro it's only good to make coleslaw and not much else it was VERY hard to clean the blades had to use a brush to push out the herbs that were stuck. Nicer Dicer is a GREAT versatile product can cut herbs/fruits(alligator cannot)and was a breeze to clean."
5,My wife loves this item!,I got this for my wife and she loves it! So much so she gave one to her ex for Christmas.You have to cut the onions into quarters or smaller if they're particularly large and give it a good whack. So much easier than dicing by hand though!
2,alligator onion cutter,I bought my onion cutter about 18 months ago and have used on a regular basis(around once a week. I think this gadget is great as I hate dicing onions. I also use it to dice cucumber. This is all until when it broke whilst cutting an onion the other day-i was really disappointed. The base has now split in 3 places and it seems is not as strong as the adverts say it is!! use very gently- especially after 1 year old.
1,Alligator Onion Cutter and Chopper,Nicely packaged but doesn't work well. The blades are not that sharp and the onion is more crushed than cut.
1,Much quicker with a knife!,"I got one of these for Christmas, and thought it looked great until I used it. You have to press down very hard, and the plastic isn't very strong and feels as though it is going to break. It does not take one motion to cut the onion, but several motions pushing the blade down and using a lot of pressure. When the blade finally cuts through the onion, small pieces of onion fly all over the place including on the floor and across the bench. I then have to gather all of the pieces that have flown across the bench to use them. In my opinion, spend a few dollars on a good knife as it is a lot quicker and easier than using an Alligator, and much more cost effective!"
3,I CAN SEE HOW SOME FOLKS MIGHT LIKE THIS,"I did'nt!!! This is a book of 10 short stories that were?? magazine articles ?? I, , ,sorta, , ,liked one ot two, , ,but. . .What was my reason? I'm not sure, , ,but, , ,here goes---the author uses too many words to describe the mostsimple things. And with language way over-the-top.Sorry, , ,I loved ""Snow falling on cedars""""."
4,Time well spent.,"Guterson in smaller bites. The pictures evoked by ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" and the thoughts from ""East of the Mountains"" comedifferently, but every bit as clearly.Not as different as ""The Other"", and perhaps that was due to the medium.I look forward to his next novel, more than short stories."
2,I'm Unimpressed.,"This collection of short stories is flat, unmoving, and quite pretentious. I remain completely unimpressed.Had I read this before I heard of Snow Falling on Cedars, I would not have read my all-time favorite novel. The poetic language and eloquent description that so impressed me in Snow Falling on Cedars seemed over done and contrived in this collection.Yes, it shows a bit of promise -- just not enough to be worth reading. I recommend skipping this collection if it isn't required reading. However, I do look forward to reading a collection of short stories by David Gutterson once he has mastered the art of subtlty and once he has learned to moderate his flare for description."
5,"Oh my, Ian is gone....","Chariots of Fire was a very inspirational work in my life. Ian Charleson as the role of Eric Liddel was especially so. I just viewed the movie again on a video iPod while I was flying from Tucson to DC. What a wonderful movie. Even more so was Charleson's portrayal of Eric Liddel -- God fearing, disciplined, and when he ran you could see the light of God in him...I am crushed by the fact that Ian Charleson passed away almost 16 years ago. I had no idea. I was hoping to find him.Long live Ian."
2,This guy is no Clancy...not even close,"After reading this book I found myself wondering if this guy ever ""really"" spent a day in the Special Forces. Little things like his attention to detail are what bothered me the most. on page 303 he mentions a character carrying a Glock pistol, on page 343 he mentions the Glock again yet in the next paragraph he states "" Cassidy cocked the hammer on his double action semi-automatic..."" If you could show me the hammer on a Glock I would really appreciate it. Glocks DO NOT have hammers.Also the poorly written ""sambo"" treatment of the housekeeper was just a bit to stereotypical. I expected her to say "" Yes massa no massa"". This guy doesn't have a clue. SF or no SF he needs to research his work a little better. Lastly the Kragle family is boring to no end. Lets hope they all die at some family reunion in a future book. Preferably murdered by the housekeeper with the terminal case of EBONICS. DO NOT COMPARE THIS RUBBISH WITH CLANCY"
1,The story of a great horse... badly told,"What a disappointment. Amateurishly written, indifferently proofed and historically inaccurate. Some of Broadhead's claims are just plain wrong, and he seems to have ignored the best sources of information in conducting his research. He also repeats himself needlessly on some of his main themes-- over and over. His insight into Whirlaway's connections' motivations is very superficial, and he comes close to slandering Alsab's owner.It's the only recent book out there on Whirlaway, but I'm not sure it's better than no book at all."
1,Weak Human Sound Effects,The human clapping and yelling sounds like a handful of poorly paid customers in a bar.
4,Interesting and different...,"I do not read much poetry of any kind, but I read this book for school project and found it to be very different from the poetry I am usually forced to read in school...there was none of the traditional meter, rhyme schemes nor any of the usual symbols that are used commonly with more European oriented poetry. All in all, it was interesting and refreshing poetry and I enjoyed reading it and attempting to analyze it."
5,SanDisk Extreme III Memory Stick Pro CArd,"Hard item to find, but easily located at Amazon.com. Item was exactly what I wanted and was delivered super fast."
5,horses!,"They're Breyer...they're cute...they are reasonably anatomically accurate....and they are durable. I still have mine from when I was a kid and played with them heavily. Now my daughters collect them, and the quality is the same."
4,Feature Gross Out Monster,"My son has really enjoyed this, however, after marks are made with the ""washable"" markers, it actually takes about 3 washings to get the marks out but they do come out eventually."
5,this is a funny informative book. everyone should read it.,"this little book truly is a work of art. the author does a great job making fun of all of us and at the same time, informing us about health issues we all face, whether we know it or not. chock full of useless and useful information regarding the foods we eat and how we delude ourselves into thinking we are eating ""healthy. a must read for anyone with a sense of humor."
4,Worth buying and reading...,"After reading this book, I found some of the 101 secrets to outstanding and others to be unuseful. However, the ones that were outstanding really have really made an impression on my 2 yr old and 4 yr old.I'd suggest purchasing this book. It's an easy read."
4,Great stuff,"A neat little book full of fun things to teach your children. Stuff like how to whistle through a blade of grass, how to build a better paper airplane, how to find the north star, etc. Lots of fun little tidbits to pass along.No life changing revelations, but it was definitely a fun read. A bonus is the little life lessons tossed in to make you feel like you're contributing to your child's character instead of just helping them learn to climb a tree."
3,Poor reception,"I had read in several reviews that the Tivoli had exceptional reception. That was one of the main selling points in my buying the Model Two (with subwoofer). In fact the system has much poorer reception than a Bose Wave Radio/CD that I also own. I give the Tivoli a ""3"" based on the fine craftmanship and obvious quality but it really didn't deliver otherwise. The sound could be magnificent if I could just hear it over the static. I live in the Western NC mountains and reception is an issue to be sure but the Bose I already own gives very clear sound compared to the Tivoli Model Two."
4,compatibility issue with other brand stereos than Tivoli,"This is quite important info if you are connecting this with some other stereos other than tivoli models. The subwoofer cable provided is male to male 3.5mm stereo jack, not the typical subwoofer mono RCA cable. My stereo having regular RCA mono female jack, i had to buy some extra cables/ adaptors before giving up this subwoofer because of the connection issue.You can find a 3.5mm stereo to mono RCA cable but it's not easy to fine and over priced.Second option: you can buy regular subwoofer cable which is mono RCA to mono RCA and use an adapter at one end to make it into 3.5mm stereo maleI, for example, bought Mediabridge Ultra Series - Dual Shielded Subwoofer Cable - RCA to RCA Gold Connector - 15ft from this site, and RiteAV - 3.5mm Male to RCA Female Adapter also here.I'll skip talking about the sound of this sub because other reviewers said everyting needed to be mentioned. It's very subtle, but obviously sounds better with."
4,Great Sounding Box,"This is a nice looking and great sounding addition to the Tivoli radio. However, I do have to keep it on the ""full bass"" setting, but when it's there it's really good. A wireless option would make this box even better, for aesthetic purposes, but all in all, I am pleased with the purchase."
5,Tivoli Subwoofer,"Excellent product. Adds the extra bass with the rest of the Tivoli system. Not booming bass, just adds the lower octave to round out the system...."
3,Good stuff,"The model two is a great little unit which I think works great on it's own, but the subwoofer is also a good addition. I like having the option to ""upgrade"" the set and this is a recommended add-on. If you already have the model 2 and you like it, then you'll be happy to get this. If you have the model 2 and are disappointed, then getting this would be a losing battle. It does not transform the sound: The addition is subtle, but good. If you already like the model 2 then this will support that appreciation. If you aren't satisfied with the model 2, then this may be more money for something not that different. The subwoofer improves the low end and makes the sound a little fuller, but does not transform it. I like to use the model 2 as speakers for a small television I have set up, which doubles as my computer monitor. Used this way the ""Model Two"" is a perfect fit."
2,OK....but,"I purchased the subwoofer when it still was 79.99 and NOT $159.99 when the price was DOUBLED earlier this year. I had to return my 1st unit due to the fact that it would not automatically shut off when the radio was turned off. Tivoli Audio replaced the unit and it works fine. It really enhances the sound of the Model Two especially when connected to my iPod. However,IMHO, it is NOT worth the current price. Sorry Tivoli, but doubling the price was NOT a good idea!"
2,Tivoli subwoofer sounds more like a chihuahua than a bulldog,"I have my Tivoli model 2, which I love, hooked up through an inexpensive home theater system and it sounds great. But sometimes I want to listen to the radio without using the home theater. The sound quality is a bit tinny so I decided to try the subwoofer to fill in the low end. When I received the new speaker I was impressed with it's eye-appealing design. I immediately hooked it up to the model 2 and turned it on. I didn't hear much difference so I cranked it's volume knob up to the max. The bass response improved, but just a little bit. I guess I'll continue to play the radio through the $40 home theater. In summary, the subwoofer looks great but the sound quality is disappointing."
1,Do Not Buy,"I got this for my sons science fair project and its a worthless piece of junk. I was expecting something that actually works not some thin plastic with paper wings. I do not recomend buying this product. It was fun for the first few times we launches it though, after that the wings bent."
2,Battery Hog,"I like everything about this player except everytime I pick it up it needs a new battery. I expected that after listening to the radio/music for 2 hours a day I would replace the battery every week. But, instead of 15 hours of play it should say 15 hours to drain the battery, play or not!At first I thought it was the carrying case pushing buttons so I removed the case and left it sitting in my desk drawer overnight. It didn't make any difference, every other day I am replacing batteries no matter how much I listen to the music.If they could fix this problem this would be an awesome player."
1,Didn't last long....,"I got one of the Mp3 players, and within my first day of using it, it was already screwed up. Also, Samsung is taking forever to reply to my complaint, and I probably don't have a warrenty because I won it at a football game!"
5,Excellent introduction to ethical theory!,"Readers familiar with ethical literature will notice that the title of Pojman's book is similar to that of the late J.L. Mackie's book on ethics, _Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong_. The differences in titles reflect the differences in opinion among the two authors: Mackie was a relativist while Pojman is an objectivist. Despite Pojman's rejection of relativism, though, he does an admirable job of presenting both sides fairly. He also writes in a clear and conversational way, making this introductory text accessible to everyone. Finally, his book is comprehensive; it includes a discussion of egoism, self-interest, and altuism; the question, ""Why should I be moral?""; religion and ethics; and metaethics."
5,Excellent treatment of Modern and Classical ethical thought.,"Dr. Pojman (poy-man) does a brilliant job of presenting the ethics rooted in Arisitotle and Aquinas and the thought of the moderns, such as Kant, in a very easy read. This s a fabulous book for anyone."
4,A good read for the religious ethicist.,"Pojman does a superb job of illustrating many different approaches to ethics, providing examples of practical application of each. This helps the reader develop a critical mind, capable of reasoning his or her way through ethical dilemmas that we all face on a daily basis. Pojman is not afraid to go for the jugular on approaches in which he finds serious flaws, such as cultural and ethical relativism. The reader will find that Pojman does not adhere to one ethical theory in particular, but rather calls for reason and judgment, based on strong moral principles, in every situation. Some situtations call for a utilitarian approach, some for a virtue-ethical approach. Whatever approach he takes, however, will be based in thorough and sound reasoning. This book makes its readers want to be better people."
3,"Clear, accessible... and full of mistakes","I find it amazing that this book is so popular -- currently in its fifth edition. It is, to put it bluntly, filled with mistakes that no professional philosopher (not to mention one who specializes in ethics!) should ever make. Crucial distinctions are omitted, problems are mischaracterized, basic views are caricatured, contemporary developments are ignored... and so on, throughout the text. The attractiveness of this book lies in its clear, accessible prose... but unfortunately, it ends there, as well; precision and accuracy are sacrificed throughout. When it comes to Pojman, stick with the anthologies."
2,Entertaing to watch but little else,"Very entertaining program to watch. I did the whole thirty classes before I went to Buenos Aires in October of 2010. I then took language classes while there.It is nice to listen to Jimena speak with a BA accent but you will not learn to speak from this course. It is completely passive.David, the other actor, speaks a considerable amount of English. It can get quite frustrating when you wish to hear Spanish.The story line is entertaining but that is about it.If you want to SPEAK the language, I would suggest The Pimsleur Method. It is much less entertaining but it does force you to speak which is something you need to do to communicate.One other thing...at first I liked the English and Spanish subtitles but I then I realized that I was relying on the English. This gave me a false sense of learning. If only you could turn off the English subtitles!"
4,Please create a version for General Latin American Spanish!,"First, let me say that I am in love with Jimena's voice. Second, this is without doubt the most entertaining Spanish program ever. Third, it is simple to use. Not like Spanishpod101 and other online programs that require as much effort to figure you how to use the program as the effort required to learn the language.Having said all that, the Spanish here is a dialect that is really used in small percentage of the Spanish speaking world. That hasn't stopped me from using it because it is so fun. Nevertheless, if they came up with a more general Latin American Spanish version, I'd use it. Also, I wish there were quizzes or something by which to measure progress.All in all, this is very fun and very worthwhile."
3,It's fun but...,"I really do enjoy this program, it's fun and I think it's great for learning more about the vos form, Argentinian pronunciation, idioms and culture. But as another reviewer pointed out, it is subtitled in English which can give a false impression of comprehension and it is completely passive. You do not get to speak at all. In my opinion you don't learn to speak and pronounce things correctly unless you do it and listen to yourself so you can adjust your mistakes. They also speak really quickly especially in the grammar and vocabulary sections making it difficult to catch what they are saying and therefore difficult to assimilate the information.I think this is great for someone traveling to Argentina, but in conjunction with a more active learning program. I am using Pimsleur."
2,Total jerk David finally drove me to give it up,"It started out as cute to have David constantly hitting on Jimena and I love her voice and her laugh. But I finally just got sick of his stupid jokes and speaking mostly in English. And it's completely passive. I am a very motivated learner of Spanish. I gave up on this about half way through. Just couldn't stand the guy anymore. A total jerk. I'll go back to the many other forms of instruction that I have been using to learn to speak, read and understand Spanish."
4,Great product but no study guide..,"Believe the reviews. Product is excellent but fast-paced. My only frustration is that it was advertised (even on their website)to come with a study guide which it did not. When I contacted the company, they were very nice in explaining that I had to print out the study guide from a digital file. I hadnt planned on over 50 pages of printing adding to the expense of the product. Besides this, I am very pleased!"
1,poor,"Everything in here is also in the Tammy Wynette cookbook.Get Tammy's cookbook instead. Also, the Loretta bookis about the calibre of a scrapbook, not a lot of recipes,and overall pretty thin. Not worth the hardback price."
5,Really good recipes,"We've tried many recipes in this book and love them.The Chili recipe is really great, best chili I've ever had (and I'm from Texas)"
5,Great,"This novel gives the reader an in depth look at a womens struggle, to survive on her own with 9 children. It's an interesting read as it gives you insight into the culture and traditions of Bahrain and that of a Bahraini lady through 3 generations. My hat off to the author on a job well done:)"
2,Could be Better,"I bought this for my son over a year ago. He is a huge Avatar fan, but this toy did not pass his standards. The biggest problems was that the launching set-up does not usually work. It is very difficult for my 7 year old to get Aang to stay down before launching him. The design is flawed. Many of the other options work great (appa raors, etc.), but since this is a launching toy, I can't see giving it more than a couple of stars."
1,Attention!,Mention that this CD is the same recording as Hans Hagen/Zeta! Both of them are horribly out of date and have an extremely bad sound quality. END
5,All In One World Leader,It was good to hear some of the anthems and patriotic airs this recordingprovides. A must have for anyone interested in such.
4,No Sophomore Slump,"If you're a Sam Roberts fan, you've been waiting a while for this album. Coming off of the phenominal debut, ""We Were Born in A Flame"", this one follows up nicely. Before I dig into how solid it is, there is one negative....it's a bit short. Ten songs means there's no room for throwaways. Which there are none! The first four songs dominate and then things slow down for a bit. There's definitely a ballad or two mixed into this effort. ""Uprising Down Under"" comes off very nice while ""A Stone Would Cry Out"" doesn't grab me yet. It's very simple song without a vintage Sam flow to it. Anyway you slice it, this is a great album that hopefully people outside of Canada will actually here. While the last thing I want is to lose my hidden secret from all other people in the States, these guys derserve to be headliners here for a while."
4,"GOOD ALBUM, BUT NOT BETTER THAN ""WE WERE BORN IN A FLAME""","DEFINITIVELY, SAM ROBERTS IS THE BEST CANADIAN MUSIC, This CD is Very good, and the best track is ""WHIT A BULLET"" Four stars for ""Chemical City"" three for the package"
1,Not very useful,This book has an occassional piece of useful information but is so general in nature as to be useless for meaningful diagnosis or repair. Would not recommend.
1,Not A Good Book,"This book claims to have all you answers for all the Briggs single and twin cylinder engines up to 20HP, it has some very basic information on the single engine and it has a little basic information on one of briggs twins thats it. If you wanted to know how the engines work, wiring infomation, specifications or any detailed information this book is not what you need."
1,Wish it would have been better,The book should be called overview of briggs and stratton engines. I found that the book lacked any usefull information for the home do it yourselfer. The book has little information on the primer bulb type carberator and little to no information on trouble shooting and solving problems of this type. His vage explanation as well as confusing illistrations has me regreting that I purchased this book.
1,lack of govenor info,"Dempsey basically says, theres two kinds, lots of varation, and if you have a problem, take it to a shop.Lacking in clear illustrations.Why did I need to spend $...to read this ?I gave it one star because 0 was not an option."
1,It does have it's uses,I find that after I have worked on a Briggs & Stratton engine the pages of this book make fairly good paper towels. Wish I had paid attention to the other reviews.
1,not happy,this book has too little info on each subject and only a few teible pictures i recamend it to no one
4,Briggs & Stratton engine repair,"I was very happy with this book. I own the repair manual issued by Briggs & Stratton and this book is right in line with it.It was nice to have both together for the different diagrams and information not found in the briggs manualThe information is clear and informative to a novice like myself this is a must.This book is useful for understanding the electrical, fuel and internal componets, from troubleshooting to complete rebuild."
1,Base information,"Lacks specifications for all Briggs & Stratton engines covered in the book. Little info on 25 hp Vtec OHV and kind. I was expecting a service manual similar to Motors Manuals. But, this was very poor and mainly the basics. Save your money."
4,small engine books,"very good book. easy to understand,, type is a bit small and a hardback would be good.small enough to fit in a glove box."
3,Links,"Bought this for my grandmother, and it was tight, seeing the reviews on here Tag should have included 2 extra links or make it big so that it can adjusted down. Otherwise a good watch."
3,Same old,"This is an important book. We know because Dr. Osterlind tells us so over and over. For a hundred bucks, it ought to be. There's really little here that Gronlund, Haladyna, and others haven't written about before. What's really disappointing is that the examples are rife with the type of careless errors and inconsistencies he so decries. Psycometrician, heal thyself!"
1,Dark pictures,Older repair manuals with dark pictures are next to useless. This one is has mostly dark pix. Avoid it.
2,Awesome Series-Crappy DVD Transfer,"This has got to be the worst case of dvd transfer i have ever seen in my life!! the picture quality is equal to a dvd you would find at a dollar store, luckily this is the only set i picked up and certainly wouldn't buy the others."
4,For Those Complaining about Video Quality,"The reason the show looks the way it does is because of the era. Many shows in the '80s were shot on film and then edited on videotape, which gives it that fuzzy look. It's a lot easier to restore film than video. It's sad it looks this way, but that's just the way it is. Some of you have mentioned that Twin Peaks is amazing restoration - that's because it was shot and edited on film.I wish the show looked better, but I'm still happy to have them, especially since I never thought Paramount would release them. Be honest: Did you ever think this would be released?"
5,2nd season MUCH BETTER than the 1st,This 2nd season was mastered much better than the first one. The audio in the first one is almost mono. Someone did a better job on this one..the video is sharper and the audio is very much in stereo. Now if only those same people could go back and remaster the 1st season again....
3,a meditative spin on gypsy music,"Gypsy purists won't like it.But if you enjoy classical music also, you may get something out of this.The violin sound does not screetch at you.It dawns on you.So its more a meditative listen.Theres upfront violin and orchestral, with light cimbalom to add to the flavour.The title and cover are poor choices.Because, even though it contains gypsy elements, the music is not as traditional as that.(If a 'hybrid' is what u seek, then u may find it's worth more stars than 'I' gave it)."
5,Breathtaking,"The tracks in this CD took my breath away, classical Hungarian music, my favourites are track 9 and track 1, could not stop dancing..awesome... I would buy more copies for friends."
1,Disappointing,"Was expceting authentic gypsy music, music with soul, with passion. What I found, instead, was a big band of violins playing dated standards ala black and white movies from the '60s."
1,Disappointment Ensured,"Altho the selections are fine and typical of the robust music associated with gypsy violins, the QUALITY of the recording is abysmal and sounds as if it were recorded by a hand-held tape recorder. Definitely NOT recommended."
2,Borrrring,"Couldn't finish it - even the big circus scene was only slightly interesting. The hero was so stiff he would barely smile, she kept bossing him around and even in the 21st century men don't put up with that very well, in the 19th it would be practically heresy. Maybe there was a big surprise at the end like she was some aristocrat, but the idea that a noble would marry a circus performer is ludicrous and impossible to believe. My first exposure to Joan Wolf is a big disappointment after hearing so many raves about her work."
1,What an incredible disappointment,"I LOVE Joan Wolf but have been more and more disappointed with her last 4 or 5 books. At least I have been able to read through them. Not so with this book. We have the same old heroine (feisty, long braid down her back, incredibly beautiful, horse-mad)whom I usually love. Her usual to-die-for hero is absent here. At least, he is only sketched in so we don't get a real sense of him. I was able to get through 3/4 of this book but the last 1/4 was so bad I could barely read it. The end of this book reads more like a rough, sketchy outline. I wish she would go back to her first-person regencies (or her earliest regencies). I can no longer just buy a Joan Wolf book automatically and that is very sad for me."
1,not even worth the clearance Wal-mart price!,"I'm not sure I've ever written a review before. This book, however, was so badly written that I had to. First of all, the suppossed 'hero' is snotty and effeminite. Right away he appears as a prissy British pansy, who the reader can not relate to at all. I actually put the book down for a few days once I got to around page 60. It was that awful! Asside from the horrible characters, some of the sequences simply don't make sense. Halfway through the book, the two main characters seem to simply fall into bed. This isn't one of those romance novels where the hero/heroine have a love-hate relationship and you're so glad they finally worked it out. It leaves the reader saying, ""How in God's name did that happen?""Overall--a horrible, horrible book. I have a giant trunk full of fabulous trashy romance novels in my basement. This one will not be joining them."
4,A supplementary volume about the properties of the sun.,"This is an excellent book for young children describing some of the latest known facts about the Sun and serving as a short introduction and supplementary text for youth interested in astronomy. This book is a part of Isaac Asimov's New Library of the Universe he started for children in the late 1980's that is supposed to be updated on a regular basis. However, Dr. Asimov died in 1992 and others are trying to continue the work and updating the various volumes. This particular book is a revision of ""The Sun,"" published in 1988."
4,Nexicam for IPaq's,"The NexiCam was a great solution to my digital camera problems since it worked directly with my Pocket PC... previously my old digital camera used a different type of memory than my IPaq Pocket PC, so transferring images between camera, PC and Pocket PC was alot more timely than I wanted.The NexiCam works great, has more features than my old Kodak digicam, is very simple to setup and I am happy to be rid of the old memory cards. I love the built in Compact Flash memory slot, zoom feature and configurable self-timer.One major downside I found was lack of good user documentation. The manual is Adobe based and very basic, you really need to experiment on your own to see the full potential of what you can do with the NexiCam (although that is alot of fun too!)"
2,waste of money,This toy was bad never work would not recommend it and I am the mom could not get to work. We give up.
3,Needs a rare screwdriver,"This is a cool little remote control school bus I bought for my 2 year old son. Trouble is, in order to get the battery into the bus part (the hand held remote also needs batteries, but they are easy to install) a tiny, very long phillips head screwdriver is required. I have a LOT of tools, but not this one, and of course its Christmas, so getting one today is out. So he's having fun using it like a regular push car, but the remote hasn't even hit his radar. WHY OH WHY do toymakers to idiot things like this???"
2,Ummmm. No,Let's see. You need two different batteries AND two different sized screwdrivers. So after buying the 9V for the remote control and searching for a long enough screwdriver to open the bus to put in the double As... I turned it on.*HONK!*HONK!*It's loud. Really loud. Ugh.
1,Burlesque,This DVD is a Blu-Ray version and my DVD player does NOT PLAY BLU-RAY. I want to return it for a credit but you make it too difficult to do so. PLEASE NOTE: THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DVD DID NOT SAY IT WAS A BLU-RAY VERSION!!!!
1,"You're Joking, Right?","Looking at the other reviews for this film, I am forced to ask myself if this page is some kind of meme I missed on reddit. Burlesque is the worst film I saw in the last decade. People claim to have been choked up by the performances, but the only gagging I did was after any of Aguilera's lines. Others claimed they cried-- the only cry I had was after Cher's absurdly melodramatic numbers, and my tears welled up as part of the laughing fit that I had to contain so as not to disturb the other poor folks who also made the mistake of buying a ticket to this camp fest. I knew what I thought I was getting into, but this was so ridiculous, it was not any fun. The plague is more favorable than the dynamic duo of divas that comprise the cast of this mediocre piece of trash."
1,BEST EVER!!!!!,YUMMMMMY this is the best tasting movie i has ever saw! that guy with the hat is HOTTTT! and the girl that can sing is niiiiiceee. i favs is wenz they flip there hairz. hooray for the parade
2,"Ok, here's my theory","A movie like Burlesque is so utterly and predictably bad that only those who are really predisposed to tolerate (and perhaps enjoy) this kind of thing will even bother to see it. So you get the kind of ratings pattern you'd expect for a true classic. Tons of five star reviews, with but a few discouraging words. We saw it for laughs, thinking it would be good camp fun...not really. But it was somewhat better than I expected, perhaps because I had seen the true crap-fest known as Country Strong only a week earlier. Burlesque isn't that bad, mainly because it has no illusions about being anything but a homage to vastly better films. But, jeesh, an average rating near 5...people, see some real movies."
4,I liked it....,"I liked this as much as I thought I would. I really liked the dance numbers, Cher is great, Stan Tucci is greater, and my speakers and sub adore the soundtrack. The only thing that took away from the experience was CA's plastic surgery-for me, pretty distracting. Her voice is a bit over the top for me, but she uses it to her advantage and it works in the film well. Other than that, great little film and will recommend to those who love a sexy dance number or two...."
2,Dancing with the Stars not Burlesque,"Comment: Cher still has a good voice... for a ""puppet on a stick"". There is nothing Burlesque about this film... except for the name of the club. Boy, I watched this with my 90 year old Mother... she asked at about the half way point if we had to watch any more. If you are expecting a movie about the tried and true Burlesque... look elsewhere. On the other hand if you are looking for a ""Dancing with the Stars"" movie, this might be your cup of tea."
5,GREAT MOVIE BURLESQUE,What to say gtreat movie cher is great and chistna are great together the music is great the dancing and the movie makes you feel good inside . i'm so happy their putting it on blue ray can't wait to watch it on my big screen at home .frank tampa ybor city
5,How I adored this movie...,"I dont know what the critiques saw, but this movie was definitely not it.This movie is FANTASTIC, despite what a lot of people who think they know better say. I ADORED it, watched it 2 times already, and plan on watching it a lot more times.Christina surprised me: she played the role very well and I dont know how many actresses could have played that role with all the singing there is to it. Christina was simply perfect for it. Cher is dazzling, I loved her, I wanted to hug her throughout the whole movie.Cam Gigandet is this gorgeous, hot, great actor that I adored (although I dont realy know how I feel about the ending with him).Well, great movie, it is really worth your money and your time!"
4,Upgrade from DVD to BLU RAY,I have this on DVD and wanted to upgrade to BLU RAY. Good movie. It arrived before the approximate ship date.
4,Movie,"The movie itself came in great shape. Cover still on. Only negative bit was that there was a small scratch on the holder. Other than that, good buy!"
2,Lacked character development,"First of all, Cher was fantastic! Tucci is seriosly on a a slippery slope of being typecast as the ""gay designer/costumer/whatever""..even though he handles the roles well. Watch ""The Lovely Bones"" if you want to see him do a really unlikable character wth the greatest of ease. I found myself fastforwarding through many of the musical performanes after enduring a few of them, they weren't bad, just boring. And other than Tess, not one of the characters are worth the time to care about.I find it odd that so many people are comparing Burlesque to Striptease, Chicago and Showgirls. Showgirls is so bad it's funny, and even though I will always think that Renee Zellweger is a terrible Roxy Hart, I loved Chicago. Striptease? Pretty sure that is the stinker that tanked Moores career."
5,"Burlesque, A Must See Musical!","This is one hot, entertaining musical in a sea of dramas this year. See it for the performances by Cher, Stanley Tucci, and Christina in her debut. See it (and buy the soundtrack) for the awesome music such as, ""Bound to You"" by Christina and ""You Haven't Seen The Last of Me"" by Cher, both nominated for Best Original Song Golden Globe Awards. Go to be entertained and enjoy it with your popcorn!"
4,"Good movie, great price","I liked this movie, even if it is a little unbelievable in parts. Christina A. can sing like nobody else, and Cher is always fun. Bought it for my daughter for Christmas, she asked for it. So we knew what we were getting."
4,Love the music,Cher is great and Christina is a ball of talent. Love this movie and watch it often when I need a smile
5,amazon shopper,I loved watching this movie. I Played it on my kindle fire and it was great. Will watch it again.
4,Good movie for Christina fans,"Not the best acting in the world, but my wife is a huge fan of Christina Aguilera which is why she likes it."
2,"Good music, but no story","If you are interested in watching good music then this is the film for you. However, you can get great music by just watching any of the countless music video shows or PBS. If you are expecting a great story, then you need to look elsewhere."
4,Great Music,"I'm not usually a Christina fan, but I really enjoyed this movie. The music was so much fun to listen to."
3,All the right ingredients but....,"I usually like musical movies, Grease, Selena, Purple Rain and The Five Heartbeats, just to name a few. This movie also seemed to have all the right ingredients, yet I found myself checking my watch several times. I think maybe the many heavy full length (non-contemporary) song and dance numbers overpowered the thin storyline. The acting was good; however I found Cher's face as distracting as Melanie Griffiths and Meg Ryan's."
4,Burlesque,"I rented this particular movie before purchasing it, and I did enjoy the amazing choreography, the music, and the costumes. As for the plot? You would do better to watch this movie on mute until the musical scenes are playing. You'd be doing yourself a favor. Still, I did end up purchasing it, and I gave it 4 stars because of the music, choreography, etc."
5,Awesome chickflick!,"Made me want to get up and start dancing too. Music was great, costumes were beautiful and two great stars!"
5,Awesome Music,"I received this DVD as a Christmas gift and I love it! The music is lively, fun and very sexy! The movie is entertaining and riveting. Cher and Christina do a wonderful job, and they sing wonderfully! This DVD makes you wish you could dance like the girls in the movie do!"
5,Burlesque,"Burlesque is a wonderful, heartwarming movie about a small town girl with greattalent who goes to Los Angeles looking for a job in the entertainment field,meets Cher, who is a fantastic entertainer and gives her a job in her club."
5,Excellent,"Great Movie, very well acted, the song were amazing, the backdrop and custumes are outstanding, I saw it 6 times"
3,Story is just so-so but I love the music,I'm not a fan of Christina Aguilera but she does have an amazing voice. I love the music. The story line is just ok.
5,great rags to riches story,"Christina and Cher did a great job, the singing was great, the women were ultra hot and sexy the dancing was great. good direction"
3,Just OK for me,The music never caught on with me and I don't feel that they utilized their star power very well. The story has been done before.
2,Cliché Central,"Primarily a vehicle for Christina Aguilera, ""Burlesque"" (2010) emerges as a colorful mess awash in B-movie clichés. Unfortunately, this musical drama lacks the classic Hollywood spark it desperately wants to recapture. Top-billed Cher has limited screen time as the club matriarch - the same goes for Stanley Tucci's stage manager. The appealing Aguilera belts out a few strong numbers, but her acting is passable at best. By comparison, Cher sings only two songs: the engaging ""Welcome to Burlesque"" and the painfully overwrought ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me."" Writer-director Steven Antin has no idea what he's doing and hopes something will stick. ""Burlesque"" runs an unwieldy two hours, yet would have been more effective in half the time. Blink and you will miss Alan Cumming in a poorly conceived cameo."
5,Burlesque DVD,This is a fabulous movie. Cher can still bat out the songs and I was blown away by Christina Aquilera singing.
4,Burlesque,It was great seeing Cher and Christina Aguilera interacting with one another. So few musical movies are made any more and the story line held a positive message. Go where your heart leads you and BELIEVE.
1,Beware!,Be careful people! All of a sudden this is getting 5 star reviews to coincide with the DVD release? I have seen this kind of scam before. This flick sucked. Ignore this insider review manipulation and don't waste any of your hard earned dollars. They are just trying to recoup money lost when it tanked in the theatres! Trust me!
1,A Joke,"Elevator music. Burlesque manages what seemed impossible: It is filled with half-naked dancing girls, yet it's still boring. So bad it's moderately entertaining, Burlesque is a lesson in how not to put on a musical. For a film with so much camp promise and the world crying out for a successor to the so-bad-it's-good cult Showgirls, this cliché packed film is disappointingly mediocre. Collapses under a heap of boring love triangles, tame backstage rivalries, ear-splitting musical numbers and hyperactively edited routines. We've seen these kinds of clubs before, usually with guys dressed up as Madonna, Barbara, Cher -- wait, there's the guy doing Cher now. In a sailor hat and tights. Oh dear God ... it actually IS Cher."
3,Burlesque,"Arrive in crushed DVD box...DVD was OK, but the case for it was broken. The same happened witht he Jackie Evanco CD case...splintered and brooken up.Beth"
5,Wonderful,When the seller says the product is in 'Like New' condition they mean it which is wonderful. The DVD came wrapped as it if has never been used and had one little mark which was cleaned off. I will be ordering more 'Like New' products again.
3,Burlesque,"I love this movie. I thought the director did an excellent job combining the show tunes with everyday life and cannot understand why the movie got poor reviews for such a feel-good musical that I equate with Victor/Victoria and Funny Girl. I wish Cher's opening number, ""Welcome to Burlesque"" Tango could have been included in the special features. The story lines and quotes were great and memorable. One of my favorite quotes is at Ali's audition when Sean says to Tess...""I couldn't take my eyes off her"" and Tess response, ""try harder"". Classic. My favorite dancer was the dancer with short black hair that she could twirl just as if it was two feet long. The only part of the movie that was distracting to me was the lighting a bit too neon where it was difficult to distinguish faces and background features."
3,Burlesque,Took too long to get here and DVD freezes in the middle and has to be skipped over. Will not order again.
4,Good old fashion song and dance,added to the playlist with other musicals like Chicago and Moulin Rouge. A bit predictable but enjoyable none the less.
3,Wow,"What a surprise, christina was beyond exception and Cher was her wonderful talented self. Enjoyed the movie with family and friends"
5,Something for Everyone!,"Love, love, loved this movie! Christina Aguilera is amazing! So skilled at both dancing and singing you can hardly believe it. And, did I mention, gorgeous? Cher is marvelous, as usual. Her two songs leave you wanting more, if you're a fan, as I am. The choreography is brilliant. Can't understand why more wasn't made of this delightful movie at the Oscars. Just loved every minute of it. Pure entertainment. Can hardly wait to own it."
4,Wow! She can sing!,Two with a wonderful set of pipes. Good movie. Hope they come out with a sequel. I would buy it too.
5,Great movie,"Loved this movie. Some of the story was predictable but never the less, it was fun. The numbers are really great - costumes and performances by all are amazing. I rented it first on Netflix and watched it several times before returning it. Then I purchased the DVD. If you love musicals as I do, you will enjoy this movie. I also enjoyed Moulin Rouge and Chicago (for comparison)."
4,Not as bad as I thought it would be - kinda like Coyote Ugly and a tad like Showgirls,"I really expected this movie to be crapola. I wasn't going to watch it, but I did and I am glad. It was actually really good. It reminds me of Coyote Ugly a little bit, but in a weird Broadway way. Christina plays a seemingly young and innocent girl that needs money, and she ends up waitressing in an supposedly seedy establishment. By working there she becomes entranced with the show and fixated on becoming one of the dancers. She keeps pushing until Cher finally says ""okay"". It gets better from there with jealousy, sabotage, a love interest, and with Christina overcoming the obstacles."
4,Cookie cutter recipe that delivers...,"Going into the movie you just know the formula and fortunately for the viewer it delivers. Christina has the right pipes to deliver and Cher is her usual stunning self, albeit with slightly more lips. The persona of the club, the owner's love of the culture that make up dying breeds, the competition for attention from the dancers all add up to an engaging movie that leaves you wanting it to go on.Even at the start its hard to believe Christina could be just a waitress and then the adventure begins. One of chasing your dreams and letting it go. Overall a very satisfying experience that leads one to dream, and want to visit the Beall and Bourbon streets of the world to drink in all that we were and can still be."
5,Burlesque,"It's not the best movie that's ever been made, but, it's still a good movie. The songs are great! I love them all! The movie it's not boring, actually it's quite entertaining, so you should buy it!"
5,Robert Horton doesn't get it,After reading the review by Robert Horton I wondered if he had actually seen this movie. I loved Burlesque the first time and loved it the second time and am waiting for the DVD to be released. It is totally entertaining and at times I almost applauded after some of the dance numbers. Cher does a stand up job in her role but if you don't like Cher go see this movie for Christina Aguilara....she blew me away with her talent. It is a feel good movie that will leave you wanting the soundtrack.
4,movie review,"This is one of those movies that my wife would watch day after day. I don't mind it myself, Christina A. is in the best shape of her life. She sings her butt off & there's lots of eye candy."
5,love this movie,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie love Christina Aguilera and Cher, their performances were nothing short of stellar. I like this type of movie,Bravo:-)"
5,What a Voices,"My Lord, what a voices have Christina and Cher, I bought the Blu-Ray and after I saw the movie I ask me, Why I don't see this movie in Big Screen?. The critics are unfair to this musical, for me, is a wonderful musical, good drama with marvelous voices.I think that you can add this movie in your personal collection without regrets."
5,why all the media shade on this movie?,"the singing was spectacular, the costumes were over the top gorgeous, and the dancing well done! the story line wasn't deep but cute and good enough to help hold the movie together. all the lines were well delivered and the interaction between everyone, outstanding. the connection between christina, cher and stanley were especially charismatic and amusing in all the right places. it was also teasingly sexy without being raunchy (which i'm sure the christina hating media would have pounced on if it had been)!the bad flack from the media is not so much about the movie, as is the fact that it's a project featuring christina. for some time i've been aware of their strong dislike for her and their constant bullying and humiliating of her every chance they get.i enjoyed every minute of this movie and purchased the soundtrack and the dvd!"
5,Love Burlesque!,"I so so excited when I bought this DVD I like so very very much this movie! and all about this, the songs, lights, music, Xtina, Cher everything an amazing movie!! So real so incredible =)"
2,Awful cover,"I watched this film at the movie theater, and I enjoyed it a lot, even though the plot is not the most original at all. But for the musical numbers alone and the wonderful voices of Cher and Christina, it was worth the ticket price. However, just because of this horrible cover, I won't buy this blu-ray. The poster for the movie was absolutely gorgeous, with its almost completely monochromatic design, so I don't understand why they would choose another artwork for its release. Completely disappointed by this."
5,burlesque,"got it quickly in excellent condition.I have to say, I bought this one because Cher was in it and I love her. But the movie was fabulous, the whole cast and music great."
5,Cher & Christina A Winning Duo,"I Thought the movie was very entertaining. It was great to see Cher back on the big screen. Her solo of ""You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me"" was one of the movies highlights. Christina sounded great as usual and the dance numbers were fantastic. Enjoy this movie for what it is, Escapism at it's finest!"
5,Good as new...how did you do that!,The claim the product was what is was ended up being true...it was totally great. I love this movie and decided I better buy it so Netflix could have their disk back.
4,The music and dancing are worth the effort.,No Academy Award performances here but the music is great and the burlesque scenes dazzling. I play the soundtrack on my iPod frequently. CA's voice is amazing.
3,Baudy Fun,The story is predictable but the musical numbers are very enjoyable. Unfortunately it sufferes from a malady that too many modern films suffer from - the sound track. To hear the conversations the viewer needs to turn up the sound but when the music comes on you get blown from the room.But over all its a fun movie and let's face it - it has Cher and Chistina what more needs to be said?
5,"WooooooW Una Historia Llena De Música, Baile y Estrellas",La Película Es Una Obra De Arte Un Mundo Lleno De Colores Música Y Unas Coreografías Y Escenografías Muí Bien Echas Una Actuaciones Excelentes Una Película Que Nunca Nos Vamos A Cansar De Ver En Especial Si Somos Fans De Cristina Aguilera Una Película Muí Recomendada Para Los Fanáticos De La Buena Música Y Mundos Llenos De Colores Ya Quiero El DvD En Mis Manos Y Deleitarme Con Todo Este Mundo Lleno De Música
5,Burlesque Blu-ray,"I loved the movie, however, the disc itself froze up twice and had to be restarted and searched for the freezing point in order to continue. I'm sure it was just this particular disc, so please enjoy the movie if you should buy. It has the same tempo as Chicago. Great music. Who knew Christina Aguliera had such a great voice."
4,Good Movie,Although the plot was almost there. The music and dances were entertaining. But I do like Cher. Good chick flick for the plot.
2,"Coyote Ugly, part 2.","A remake of Coyote Ugly. Predictable and with a very simple plot. Watch it only to prove your wife that you love her.... and remember, you get to choose the next flix."
1,The quality sucked,DO NOT USE AMAZONS SERVICE - QUALITY IS TRASH. YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD AND THEY HAVE NO CUSTOMER SERVICE NEVER USE THIS SERVICE
2,Very poor writting,"The scenario could have been written by a Walt Disney production. It's predictable and near to stupid. But the entertainment is great, the singing impressive and it's great to see that Cher can still move her face..."
4,"Burlesque - dancing, yea",I loved the movie when I rented it now I want to have it for my library. If you love dance movies and feel good stories then this is for you.
4,Fantastic musical numbers,"Not quite sure why this film made no money in the theatres, musicals are such an underappreciated lot these days. But if you like Christina's and/or Cher's voice(s) and big, splashy dance numbers, you have to see it. The music and costumes will blow you away!"
5,If a Dancer,"OK, lets be open and honest at the start here. If you do not enjoy watching dancers, especially Burlesque dancers, this may be a hard to view movie. This is not for you if you cringe when lingerie appears on the screen.If on the otherhand you are not offended ny this the movie will quickly move from a 1 to a solid 3-4 for you. If you enjoy such themes and enjoy dance I think you will give it a 5. If you enjoyed queen of the Moulin Rouge ,Pracilla Queen of the Desert, Mama Mia, and Black Swan this is a must watch. Although there is a lot of fantastic music (just picked up the soundtrack) it is not a musical, but a wonderful story.Its a fun story, there are seductive view, it deals with relationships that shape lives."
2,Cher should have done all of the singing.,"Except for her opening song, Miss Christina is not very good at what she does. There is not screen appeal or acting ability.Cher is the star, but she took a back seat. Shame really. She has a lot more experience as a diva."
5,Burlesque,This movie was just what I wanted it to be. I'm a Big Big fan of Cher's and Christina's and this movie didn't let me down. It was so good it is what I call a pre-order keeper!
2,Burlesque (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo),"First of all, this movie is the same old story of small town girl down on her luck who moves to the big city and ends up becoming a huge star and saves the business. Only difference is that Christina Aguilara is wonderful in the movie. Her singing is great as usual. Cher was OK. I would give this movie a 2.5 out of 5.As far as the blu-ray disc goes...right at the end of the movie (maybe about 1/8th of the movie left to go) the audio did not match up with the video. It was EXTREMELY distracting to the point that I had to stop the movie. I am upset with the quality of this disc. I would have sent it back but didn't want the hassle.This is unusual for Amazon as most of my purchases through them have been fine."
4,I like it,"I liked the progression of the movie and I further liked that it showcased everyone but Cher. As a seasoned actor and performer, I like that it showcased the newer talent and stayed true to the store. Of course Stanley Tucci makes everything worth a look."
2,dislike,I was excited to receive this item and I wanted to watch it. I don't like the fact that when I open the case the DVD when not in it's place and when I try one of them did not work at all. I tried it on different DVD players with no luck. lucky for me the other DVD did work. I won't buy a combo anymore.
3,"Subtitled but NOT closed captioned (and yes, it matters)","I liked this film enough to buy it. It's fun! But while watching on premium cable, the film had been captioned for the hearing impaired and Amazon also listed it as CC. I just bought it and discovered that it's subtitled instead. The difference is that there are at least three singing pieces (including ""A Guy Who Takes His Time"") that have no lyrics provided on the screen. Whoever subtitled it deemed it unimportant. This is unacceptable!"
4,A perfect role for Cher and she played it to the hilt!,"My husband and I enjoyed Burlesque and thought it was made for Cher and she didn't disappoint. Cristina Aguilera's performance was fantastic. And the remaining character actors' performances were very good. Yes, it is a little soapy but the music and acting more than made up for what is lacking. It is a fun musical rather than a classic (or classy) Broadway 5-Star musical."
2,Didn't expect much but was still disappointed!,The dancing and singing of Christina and Cher could not make up for this movie's boring theme and horrible acting!
1,DVD does not work,It just stinks that it does not work and amazon wants me to jump thru hoops to return I dont have a printer and im not home during the day to wait for ups to pick up. so im stuck with a bad dvd dont think Ill be ordering and dvds from them anymore.
4,"Formulaic, but fun","OK, a small town girl from Iowa goes to the big city to make good. Original? No. But in the hands of director Steve Antin, and a cleverly assembled cast of A-listers, the film is quite entertaining.I'm not a fan of Aguilera's voice, but she is a capable actress, and her singing is less ""stylized"" than usual, and it works. Cher is enjoyable, as always, and Stanley Tucci and Alan Cumming bode well, as well as a snotty performance from Kristin Bell.I especially enjoyed newcomer Cam Gigadet, very engaging in the male lead. His career should flourish.The idea is so old, but some fresh approaches, some good original tunes, mixed with oldies, and a strong cast that buys in to the narrative, collectively make this a most enjoyable film.Don't dismiss ""Burlesque"" too quickly. As entertainment, it succeeds on many levels."
