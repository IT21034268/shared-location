5,Excellent and Accessible,"I am a native Finnish speaker, and my husband is not. We purchased both the book and the CD, which I would highly recommend. Even with me being a native Finnish speaker, it was really useful for my husband to be able to hear the dialogues in Finnish, spoken at a normal conversational rate. I would highly recommend both the book and the CD."
2,Tapes alone terrible!!!!,"This is strictly regarding the tapes ""Mastering Finnish."" While amazon includes reviews of the text book, the tapes do not come with a book. I haven't been able to find the textbook on amazon. Alone the tapes are of no help to one new to Finnish. The tape I listened to included dialogues in Finnish with introductions in English. There was no introduction of simple words, no repetition of frases. Perhaps this would be a helpful tape for someone more advanced. For me, listening to Finnish radio online would be as good."
4,A near-perfect collection of cruisin' R&B oldies.,"While this CD would not be my first choice as the soundtrack to cruisin' down the freeway, highway or avenue (preferably in a convertible with the top down!) it's still a superb collection of 1960s-'70s R&B. The songs by The Commodores, The Spinners, Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, Bobby Womack, The Staple Singers and Smokey Robinson are timeless and this is a near-perfect collection of smooth and classic vintage R&B. The liner notes are also very interesting and insightful. A nice package indeed."
5,pleasently surprised,"I heard songs that I had'nt heard in years,Groovin,grazing in the grassand more.Excellent."
4,Well Done,"The Strength of the Sun is a well-told tale with interconnecting stories filled with characters whose lives unwittingly overlap. Everyone's life essentially changes to take a different path, the day of a solar eclipse and Chidgey uses the imagery of the sun very well throughout the novel. There are two sort of nagging questions in the novel. The first concerns Colette, a young woman who keeps receiving mysterious letters about the recuperation the friends of a man in England. Colette is intrigued, as the reader will be. The second concerns the mysterious disappearance, years earlier, of Laura, the teenage daughter of Malcolm and Ruth-who have hired Colette to watch their young son. This novel is a quick read-but it's not light by any stretch of the imagination. Just a pleasant, thoughtful novel. Enjoy."
4,Great Thriller about a Tragic Series of Events,"This book details the rash of barn fires in my hometown on March 14, 1992. I wasn't living there at the time and this book provides some great insight into the events of that fateful night, even though it's a work of fiction. This book provides an amazing view into the life of the enigmatic Amish community I grew up near but never really got to know (like the majority of my fellow Lewistown residents). The story line flowed really well and kept my interest as it alternated from the post-fire investigation to flashbacks detailing the events leading up to that fateful night. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will be sharing it with my friends and family members."
3,pulley,"it was a bit different from original, but worked out well, mechanic added an additional piece to get it to work"
2,Monk,"I purchased this CD so I could play the theme from Monk on the first day of school. On TV the singer sings It's a Jungle Out There. Since our theme this year was the jungle, I thought this would be the perfect song to have playing when students arrived the first day. However, this CD contains only music. The theme song is nowhere to be found. I was very disappointed. It says the theme songs from Monk. If this is true, where is the song one hears at the beginning of each episode? I felt the advertisement was very misleading. I now have a CD that I have paid for and will not be able to use."
5,Thank you Jeff Beal,"I hear Monk's mind in this music. Thank you for recording it. Jeff's music is elegant like Monk's thinking process. When I watch Monk I have to mute the no-talent Newman. Newman proves that it is possible to even sound like a slob, what a waste of notes."
3,Monk TV Soundtrack Album,"To begin with, I am a big MONK fan from 'Day 1'.Without a doubt, where would the show be without the music. And like with so many other Monk fans, I am disappointed that when the TV soundtrack finally came out that the 2nd. theme song wasn't included; by all rights it should have. It would be great if Jeff Beal Produced a second album to compliment the first & adding the other theme song--IT'S A JUNGLE OUT THERE.Hopefully in the near future... Let us hope for we Monk fans the wait isn't too long. Perhaps the possibility of a special (Monk-CD? But while we're waiting around, we can watch out favorite detective--and a cute one at that; MONK. Don't make us wait too long, Jeff. We're Countin' on ya. And perhaps if we're able, we can put (IT'S A JUNGLE OUT THERE)on our cell phones as one of our ringers; hey--what a great idea!Now everybody, let's hum our favorite theme song.... One, two, three...P.A. Gross"
1,"No ""It's a Jungle Out There""","The only song I wanted was ""It's a Jungle Out There"". How do I get it? On the monk web site you can listen to the song but you cannot buy it. What kind of world is this when you can't get the songs you want, oh yea It's a Jungle Out There. You can buy the episode at the apple web site but there are no results from a search on the song. Unhappy. PS if the records execs are going to keep us from swapping music they should make avaiable all the music I could of swapped. that is the least they could do but most of my searches are not available."
4,"Great, but missing some stuff","If you are a fan of Monk, and/or if you are just a fan of 'souondtrack music' in general, you will not be disappointed by this album.This includes the first season theme, several reprises, and plenty of 'incidental' music from the series. The use of themes and colors in the orchestration is very entertaining, whether you are familiar with the series or not.The only drawback is that it does not include the show theme used from the second season on - ""Its a Jungle Out There""... Given that this is the theme most people are now associating with the show, its absense is deafening."
5,A Great Gift for The Monk Lover/Jeff Beal Fan!,"I received this CD as a gift for my birthday (8/13) and was completely thrilled...I didn't know it had even been released yet! The music is stylish, energetic, poignant and joyful all at once... sort of like Monk himself!My favorite moment in my favorite MONK episode is the second track on the CD... it's called ""Miming Mr. Monk"" (from Mr. Monk Takes A Vacation). At the end of the show, Adrian does a silent summation based on the interaction he'd had all episode with the hotel detective played by Polly Draper. Already I don't need to be in the same room as the CD to recognize when this one randomly pops up on the computer and I stop whatever I'm doing and imagine the scene from the show.Each piece is like that - reminicent, haunting and totally appropriate for fans of the show or just fans of Jeff Beal's who are listening for pleasure!"
2,"Lots of heat, but no fire","This is Sam Sheppard's (he wrote and stars in it) incestuous love story, told at a fever pitch. Eddie (Sheppard) and May (Kim Basinger) have been lovers since high school; only later do they find out they have the same father. Their relationship becomes one of frustration and rage as they dance around each other in a seedy motel somewhere in the West, yelling and socking each other over a passion that cannot be. It goes on too long and the flashbacks that reveal the root of the problem come too late and too fleetingly. The principles do their drag-'em out best, but in the end it's much ado about very little. The movie is not very entertaining or enlightening, and it has a strong egocentric feeling about it for Sheppard. Randy Quaid also appears."
1,"Fools, foul","My first Altman was Nashville (1975), until today a five star, like some of his later hits - The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993) and Prt-Ã -porter (1994). Fool for Love is like a poor country version of Tennessee Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Richard Brooks, 1958), only that the main characters are not played by Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman and Burl Ives. Kim Basinger tries hard to get some logic into her part, but literally collapses against an incoherent, rather empty script. Lots of unmotivated violence. Nothing to write home about!"
3,A surprisingly good effort.,"Books based on games are rarely terribly inspiring, and in some ways this is no exception - the writing quality isn't high, and at times too much effort is made to fit the set's cards into the story (constant attacks by lumbering satyrs and horned trolls spring to mind). However, the story is more mature and involving than might be expected for a book based on a card game and does fit the story depicted on the cards without many glaring omissions or contradictions (though it does contradict the text of the Stronghold card Bandage, which suggests Takara is really Takara at the time rather than Volrath). Having followed the crew's adventures on the cards rather than in Rath and Storm, it was nice to see a side to their characters which doesn't come out in the card text. Volrath's self-loathing was also depicted fairly well, though his attempts to corrupt Gerrard with his talk of hatred were both unsubtle and unrealistically effective."
3,thrilling and provocative,"The book kept me on the edge of my seat. I could hardly put it down at times. It was however confusing at times, and i did lose interest in some parts. All things considered it is a must read for any true magic fan."
1,lacking creativity...,"Geto Boys are an amazing rap group.I love the regular version of this CD. However, I intentionally bought the ""clean version"" of this CD to play in a setting that required more socially acceptable language. The clean version is identical to the dirty version but with words muffled/silenced out of the song. This is one step better than the old school beeping out of the cusswords, but if you are going to take the time to edit the vocals out and actually press up an alternative version to your release, take the time and put in alternative vocals, so it flows and plays like an actual song not all butchered up. I know there is an additional cost to studio time, but there are additional sales to the ""edited"" version. It is an artistic & creativity thing really. If the artist is going to put out a ""chopped and screwed"" version of everything release, invest some time into your clean version and make it worthwhile or don't press a clean version up"
5,Matus demolishes every pro-Oxford argument,"No one in Shakespeare's lifetime, or the first two hundred years after his death, expressed the slightest doubt about his authorship.Irvin Leigh Matus should be commended for his industry. It must be hard work wading through the anti-Stratfordian swamp."
2,Not as advertised,"Matus seems to be the sort of person one could actually coverse with productively. However, his book has several serious problems. He repeatedly begins arguments and then fails to following through. He frequently undermines his own arguments. His treatment is 'hit and miss', by no means comprehensive. That Schoenbaum found it to be the ""mother"" of all books on the subject tells us more about Schoenbaum than it does about Matus' book."
5,Welcome Home!,"I received this book as a gift. It is a great reader. It is good to be reminded of from whence we have come. But more importantly the book encourages us to be about our Father's Business, respecting and nurturing the Harvest rather than being so quick to inspect it, and reject it."
1,old news,This video is not new and is not representative of good documentary work on the history of special forces. This video is a poor compilation of footage of different special forces. Save your money and watch the History Channel.
1,Horrible Quality,"I purchased a new BBQ and this cover, paying more for the premium cover knowing that we occasionally get snow and I wanted to protect my new BBQ as well as possible. After just 2 months the cover started to tear at each of the 4 corners. Unfortunately the return period is only 30 days so I am stuck with a horrible product, out the cost, and now have to go purchase a different product. I am a regular Amazon shopper and this is the only product I have ever been extremely disappointed in."
4,loved it,I loved touched by an angel so much. Kept me very entertained. I would be very happy to recommend this. A well deserved 4 stars from me.
3,"Okay, but...","I really do like ""Touched by An Angel"", but the endings are always the same. The angels arrive in disguise on the scene to help some clueless human see the error of their ways. This usually doesn't work so they turn on the glow and announce ""I am an angel and God loves you"". This of course solves everything and everyone goes away happy. Of course if they had done this at the beginning of the episode, there wouldn't be much of a show!I much prefer ""Highway to Heaven"" where Michael Landon as an angel rarely tells the people he's there to help that he is an angel. I can better relate to something like that. It leaves you more with the impression that yes, there are angels there helping us, even though they don't always announce themselves as such."
2,Touched By An Angel--The Incomplete First Season,"I would rate this higher except that the first season is incomplete. There are a number of shows not on this so-called first season. There are 11 episodes from the first year and the last two episodes from the ninth year. What's up with that.I have always been a fan of Touched By An Angel. The series was my Sunday-go-to-church-program. I needed it to get through my week--to remind me what life needs to be like. I learned almost two months before the First Season was come out. I was so excited. I've waited along time for this, expecting the full season.But as anyone will see when they purchase this, there is no complete season. The Christmas episode with Randy Travis called ""Fear Not"" is a two part series. The second part is not there. I have no idea why not--it should be. In this regard, this is false advertisement. Otherwise.... I love the series and have watched all 13 segments.But please--don't be surprised--you won't get the whole season."
1,What about the deaf community-not closed captioned!!,"Our family loved Touched By an Angel. We gave our hearing impaired daughter the Season One DVD set for Christmas. Imagine her disappointment to discover the set was not closed-captioned. It is shameful to ignore the deaf community who should be able to enjoy the inspirational message portrayed in the series with the rest of the family. It has sadly tainted the wonderful feelings we had for the series. I wish you could have seen the excitement on her face when she opened the set on Christmas morning, then seen the tears in her eyes when she tried to play the DVD's and learned they were not close-captioned. Shame on CBS!"
3,none,Some of the scenes in the series were dysfunctional.Some of the scenes in the series were dysfunctional.Some of the scenes in the series were dysfunctional.
3,Corny and Cheesey,"This show is a little on the preachy side. I like a lot of the story lines and I love the guest stars on different episodes, but I can't stand the corny and preachy aspects of it. It's a little too wholesome for me. Sorry."
4,THE WAIT IS OVER!,"Finally, Touched By an Angel on DVD! We waited a long time for this and hopefully we will see all nine seasons released. I would have rated this 5 stars, but found a wee bit of disappointment in the video transfer. Many times throughout the episodes the scenes appear grainy and uneven (the exception being the two part series finale, which is an excellent transfer). I felt a lot sharper picture could have been obtained. But, I forgive this for the privilege of having these episodes. (I would like to say that Paramount did an absolutely stunning transfer on the Laverne & Shirley boxset! The picture was stunningly clear and the colors vibrant! Kudos for that!) This DVD set also has 4 audio commentaries that are delightful, and give some nice insight and behind the scenes details. Overall, a delightful release that will sell well. Looking forward to Season 2!"
5,I love Touched by an Angel.,I had forgotten how it made me feel. My husband bought me season 1 for Christmas and I am already half way through the second disk. I would recommend this product and seller to anyone who is spiritual. My almost 4 and almost 6 year old even like the show. But be warned it will bring up questions from the little ones while you watch it.
5,Fear Not,"For those of you were asking, ""Fear Not"" was an episode in and of itself. The same characters, Joey, and his brother, played by Randy Travis, however, appeared in a follow-up episode, ""The Feather"", however, this was not the second part of ""Fear Not"".Mark"
5,life changing,"I have seen many episodes of touched by an angel and after the first few, I found that it was making me ask questions about faith and God. This prompted me to join a local church and to my surprise the minister there had visited the cast and crew of the series.Eventually this led to me to give my heart to the lord and I will always be grateful to 'Touched by an Angel'for starting my journey.God works in mysterious ways.I have now got the series on DVD and still watch it on Hallmark.I always find that it covers every aspect of living in our society today and shows us all how to cope and what choices we can make.Thankyou to everyone at Touched by an Angel."
4,Recommend it,IT's a good product. The contour actually works to make the face look slimmer. It looks very natural and fresh. Didnt give it a five b/c the blush is light and requires more application than usual (enven the pink deeper) but that does not bother me too much.
2,Not any better than drugstore brands,"Nice packaging, but I can get the same thing a quarter of the price at my local drugstore. Did not work exceptional and I didn't look 5 lbs lighter as Mally boasts in her pamphlet! They should at least provide a brush...."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"I received the Mally compact today. It was to be a Christmas gift for my daughter. She has gotten it for the last three years. She loves it. It was delivered by USPS. It was in an envelope. I opened the envelope , and powder started falling out. I took the compact of if its box, and it was a mess. Before, I got the compact exposÃ©d, I suspected it had been used, but it had been abused. It should have been heavily bubble wrapped and boxed. I immediately went to my account to request a refund and a shipping label. The package has been returned . I have only had one problem with Amazon previous to this, but it was with another vendor. I am very disappointed."
3,A Disjointed Detective Story,"One armed private detective Dan Fortune is hired by Angela Price to check up on her husband who she fears may be in some sort of trouble with a business deal. The case turns out to be part of a long, long night for Fortune as he conducts his search for his target, Jack Price. While on his trail, the body counts begins to grow with alarming rapidity leaving Fortune to unravel the mystery into who the murderer is and why were the murders committed.Concentration is key in following the plot to this detective mystery. We jump from character to character, changing points of view with regularity. I thought the effect was a rather disjointed story that was lacking in impact."
1,rain wimp,"I wanted a cheap rain gauge, but this was close to what i thought was a good choice. Works fine on a clear day but the sightest rainfall and the gauge reports low batteries. I have to reset the the reciever about 20 times before it works again to pull the same game on the next rain storm. If you want reliable rain readings, spend a few bucks more and buy an Oregon Scientific model instead."
3,My Review Wireless Rain Gauge,I have own my wireless rain gauge for a few years now. The main reason i gave it a 3 star rating is its ability of accuracy. I have a old glass tube rain gauge and during heavy rain it dont read as much as a inch off to the glass tube gauge. It seems to stay ok with lite rainfall. The battery life is about normal for any wireless device.
1,"Save your money, don't buy this","We bought and used the rain guage for about 2 months during the summer of '06. For winter storage, batteries were removed and both parts were stored inside until recently. A number of new batteries were tried but the guage consistently begins with ""00.00"" then jumps to ""22.68."" For the price, this was a poor investment.Don't waste your money"
3,Great ... when it works,"Both my father and I have these rain gauges, and both of us have experienced failures in the rain collector transmitter. They work great when they work, but be prepared for a high failure rate ... at least, in our experience."
1,Not worth the money!,I bought two of these (didn't learn my lesson with the first). They just don't transmit well. Worthless.
1,does not work,"Who do I complain to??? this item does not work at all. My old timeynail up rain gage, said 1 and 1/2 inches of rain..My new acurite raingage said .42 inches..what the heck, its not even close to beingACURITE..this has been the case with several rainey day readings..the rating should be ""0""T. Jones"
3,Cool rain guage,"It's handy to have a rain guage that doesn't mean I have to go outside to read and empty. This guage is easy to set up. After my first rain, I'm not sure of the accuracy. I left up my old tube guage and they read different amounts. Maybe the electronics need to be calibrated? I'll keep comparing for a while."
1,Unreliable,This was the 2nd Acu-Rite wireless rain gauge I've received as a gift. Each lasted less than one rainy season...spring thru fall. Each of them worked ok for about 3 months. I kept an old see-thru gauge to compare. The Acu-Rite was terribly inaccurate after 3 months. The official weather reporting station is only about 5 miles from my house so I felt confident our rain fall amounts should be similar. The Acu-Rite proved time and time again that it was Acu-Wrong. A few days ago we received .80 inch of rain. The Acu-Wrong reported .000 for 24 hours after the rain stopped. The next day the gauge read .36 inch of rain. The sending unit and receiving unit were approximately 20 feet from each other. The only obstruction was a sliding glass door. I have removed the new batteries and thrown the unit away.
3,Acu-Rite Rain Gauge.,Received very fast. The accuracy of this rain gage is not very good if you compair to a manual rain gage. Reads about 3/4 the amount of the manual rain gage.
1,Pass on this. Get an EZ Read,"I bought this as an ""upgrade"" to my EZ Read. I thought it would be handy to not have to shine a flashlight out the window to read the gauge at night like I have to with my EZ Read. Well, it rained today. The reliable EZ Read showed 7/8"" the sophisticated electronic rain gauge had just 0.27"". So, the fancy electronic model is off by a factor of 3.5! Forget this unit. Buy an EZ read."
2,Acu-Rite Wireless Rain Gauge,"This rain gauge should be avoided in my opinion. Mine will not reset easily. I must remove the batteries from the outside unit before I can get it to reset to 0.0, and sometimes it won't even do that. It seems accurate other than this annoyance."
2,poor preformance,"First, Im amazed at what some sellers are asking for this rain gauge. Some as high as $ 30 + $9.99 S&H. This thing sells in most Walmart centers for just uner $ 20.00 with NO S&H to pay extra for. I bought one. It simpley preformed poorly. I have two manual gauges and a very accurite rain gauge on a Davis Vantage Vue weather station to judge it by. This product failed to measure rain accurritly each and every time by as much as a full half inch off. So, figuring I just got a "" dud, I returned it to place of purchase and got another. Same results. Measurments were way off the other gauges ( which, by the way were all accurite with one another ) Its just a cheaply built plastic toy, that for serious weather buffs, and maybe even some not so serious ones, is useless."
2,Worked well enough for two years but then...,"This served me well for two years. It transmitted the info through bricks, glass and metal over a distance of 50 feet for about two years until the batteries needed replacement in the exterior unit. After that problems mounted, performance became spotty and I finally threw it away after three and a half years. Never did like having to unscrew four tiny screws just to change the batteries in the outside unit. This by itself is poor design. Not worth price and frustration for just two years of good service."
3,Battery Killer But Still A Good Product,"I've had this gauge for over a year now and am mostly satisfied, but the batteries in my receiver only last for about a month. I have similar AcuRite products that I've never changed the batteries in so I'm not sure if I have some sort of fault in mine or if this product is just a battery killer. But the batteries are my only complaint, the unit works great and transmits the data to the receiver just fine as long as there's a window between the two. I would like to note too that the documentation said to bring the transmitter in during icy conditions. Well when its icy I dont really feel like walking outside and removing this from where I have it mounted, but its still working fine for me."
1,Like the others: Dies after about 5 months use. OVERHEATS... gets VERY HOT,"Want to know about this great little Belkin USB hub? It works great for 5 to 7 months, and then it overheats and dies. When I bought this beauty, it had about 25 positive review and only one bad one. Now look: It has 30 positive reviews and 22 bad ones. All will tell you the same thing. Works great for a while, then it will die. I loved the design of this thing. Perfect. Strange that Belkin offers a new 7 port hub. It is like they are admitting that they know this one will crap out. I haven't gotten any response from belkin. So, I will try a D-Link USB hub this time. Sorry, Belkin!"
3,"Amazon 5, Belkin 0","The Belkin 7-port is a nicely designed USB hub and works well for one to two years. (I have had five of them.) With Amazon's pricing they can and should be considered disposable, to be replaced within two years. Under no circumstances trust the company, Belkin, regarding rebates since they are liars and cheats. Amazon, on the other hand, will go above and beyond to make good on the rebate promises Belkin fails to honor. As far as the operation of the device, it works as advertised and is quite convenient for jump drives because of the top loading two ports. It does seem to run warm or even hot, depending on the loads, and I suspect this contributes to the unexpectedly short life span. In summary - good price-performing, disposable hub - do not trust Belkin with rebates."
1,Belkin 7-port USB Hub a Failure,"I purchased the Belkin Hi-Speed USB 2.0 7-Port Hub, Model # F5U307 on 11/12/2008 from Best Buy. It worked well until 2 weeks ago and then starting running Hot and shutting off. I tried only plugging in 1 or 2 devices instead but it still ran hot and shut down. Research shows that this Belkin device has a widespread history of this problem. I will call Best Buy and Belkin today for resolution. If refused, then Belkin will be on my Do Not Buy list overall. Have used their products in the past but things change as companies use cheaper and cheaper products."
2,Disappointed - but it's a good idea,I like the idea of being able to stack these usb hubs however this particular model has had widespread problems with heating issues. I thought maybe it was just mine but after reading other reviews on this site and others it's not - a lot of these hubs end up overheating and basically shutting off. This will then not come back up unless you turn the hub off and back on again after it's cooled down a bit. This also means that you can't use it to connect any critical components such as a usb mouse or keyboard to it (obviously not a great product if you are afraid to use it for its intended purpose). I like belkin products but come on already and get a new version out for us. What a waste of money.
2,Nice hub ... while it lasted,"I used this at work -- it's what the IT guys gave me when I asked for a USB hub. It worked flawlessly for about 6 months or so. Then my computer started complaining that it couldn't recognize what it was any more, even with no USB devices plugged into it. If I powered it down for maybe a half an hour then re-connected it, everything was fine for several weeks... then it would happen again. I went through several cycles of this, but eventually it stopped working for good.I went to our IT guys and told them it had died. They gave me another one (same model) and the same thing happened -- okay for about half a year, then erratic, then dead. Both were rev 3's.I love the design, especially the top-loading ports. But given my track record with this hub, I can't recommend it. It would probably be okay, though, if you don't plan to keep it powered 24/7."
1,Mine's Cooked!,"Hey Belkin, are you reading this stuff? My hub, like so many others mentioned in these posts has overheated and died after about a year. Belkin should be feeling some heat over this product."
1,almost caused a house fire,never thought it would happen to me but this thing does heat up and die in a spectacular way. at first i thought my son was playing with bubble wrap but then i started hearing electrical arching sounds along with the popping sounds coming from our computer room. asked my wife to check on our kid and she yells back that one of my electronic device is on fire. ran to the room and find sparks flying out of the usb ports of the belkin hub. smoke already filled the room before i could unplug the device. i was lucky the computer it was connected to did not sustain damage. i realized later that the popping sounds were probably caused by capacitors exploding inside the hub. good luck to anyone who owns this product. others who are considering should look elsewhere.
5,does what it needs to,"I haven't been the least bit aware of this thing since I got it. That's the highest praise you can have for a device like this. I'm running a keyboard, mouse, and two usb midi controllers on it."
4,Reliable - this is my second,"I just purchased my second Belkin hub. The first one I bought and used for 2 years (the computer is on 24-7) without any problems. It's still working. I haven't had any issues with a warm hub as reported by some other reviewers. I've recommended it to friends. The only negative is once it's filled with USB cords it doesn't sit so well on the desk.I've run a variety of devices on it- Scanners, printers, USB hard drives- seems to work with just about everything (although some devices like 3.5"" hard drives need to provide their own power supply of course).I like the lights which confirm that a device is plugged in (because some devices do not show up in the system tray). Two of the ports face upward - which are really convenient for devices that you tend to unplug after you are done with them - like USB flash drives- or camera memory."
1,Overheats and dies,Like others I have had this device for several months. Just a couple days ago i found that the devices plugged into it wouldn't work and the hub was so hot you couldn't touch the bottom. Thanks Belkin for a product that lasts just long enough for the warranty to expire. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.
1,It's not just this item...,It's not just this model that overheats and shuts off. I have an older model Belkin 7-port USB hub and it does the exact same thing. I think the only halfway decent Belkin item I've ever owned is an FM transmitter for playing my iPhone through the car stereo. I will never buy a Belkin brand item again.
2,Broke after 18 months,"Worked well for 18 months. Then no power to my accesories, including printer. Not being a computer adept it took me awhile to find the source of the problem. Reading reviews of other Belkin products, short working life seems to be a common thread. I won't buy Belkin again."
2,Stopped Working,"Worked fine for about 1 year, then all of a sudden stopped functioning. As I look through the reviews here, I see I am not alone in having this problem. While having two more or less front facing ports and the rest in the rear is a plus from a cabling neatness standpoint, it appears that there are some serious reliability issues with this device."
1,No iPhone or iPad support,Do not buy this hub intending to use it with an iPhone or iPad. As soon as you plug the device in you will get a warning on the device that indicates that charging is not supported. iTunes will recognize that something has been plugged in but will generate an error within seconds.
1,"Failed, complained about not enough power, needed resets","This just didn't work reliably. Devices compalined that it was underpowered even when I plugged in the power cord. Often had to unplug power and reset unit to get it to work and sometimes just to get XP to notice it was there.0 stars is more accurate. Another failure of quality from Belkin. Unfortunately the person purchased it and didn't return it in time so they just lived with constant flakiness until they ripped it out and trashed it. I bought another Belkin USB hub, different model, for a different customer. It was also flaky with USB devices on the hub vanishing, but if the devices were plugged into te PC they were fine. Belkin does not have good Quality Assurance in their fmanufacturing"
3,Flaky and disappointing performance,Like several other reviewers I found this unit to overheat and require unplugging and restarting for it to work. Also the power plug easily falls out. Not recommended.
5,Love These Things!,"Let's you route several USB devices to your desk. VERY convenient ports on topside for flash drives and so forth. Sleek design. Very durable. (Unless of course the cleaners decide to dump 20 binders on top of it and snap the ports out of the housing, which is why I had to replace it. OK, so it's not indestructible, but then what is. And you'll notice I bought an exact replacement.) Get it; you won't be sorry."
1,"One broke after a month, second broke after a year.","This hub is low quality. One broke after a month, and the replacement failed after a year. It is non-functioning on a mac and a PC, and I tried the ""plug it into the wall fix"" that others have written about in reviews. I've tried everything, and it's dead. I'll buy a different brand as a replacement. Low quality. Buy a different hub."
1,8 months and no longer working,"This product worked well for about six months then started to work intermittently, but it finally stopped working after eight months."
2,Overheated and died,"I'll add my experience to what seems like a common problem for this hub. I had the hub for about two years, with no problems. Then today, I plugged in my iPhone, then a little later plugged in a bluetooth keyboard to charge. About 10 seconds later, the sound from my speakers crackled and went out. I thought the speakers (13 year-old Harman Kardon SoundSticks) had died. After a little investigation, I found that the hub was very hot, and none of the peripherals plugged into it were available. However, the keyboard and phone still indicated they were still charging.In any case, it's now toast, and I am looking for a replacement. As much as I like the design of this hub, it is attractive, expandable, and the ports are nicely accessible between top and back... I can't bring myself to buy another one.Buyer beware."
1,Worked for about 18 months,After about 18 months periodically loses connection with devices connected. The top two connectors have never been usable as the usb cables fit too loosly. Am no long able to use it due to poor reliability.
1,Buy something else,I had one of these for about 2 years that worked OK. Bought a second unit to stack on top. The new unit worked for a month and then quit.
1,"OK for Flash Drives, Not so for other devices","I ordered this product about 6+ months ago and have been using it at my desk at work. At first it worked great, but then it started being picky about USB devices that I plugged into it that were not flash drives. My PC would tell me that the ""devices would work faster if plugged into a hub faster than 1.0"". Since I am a developer this device has made me very angry. Any non-standard USB devices keep getting connected and disconnected and are able to lock up my PC if I am currently using the device, since it did not release properly. Now I can only use it for flash drives."
1,Could support only 3 external HDs,"I bought this hub to create a small farm of 6 external hard drives. When I pulled in the 4th HD, only 3 would work. Called Belkin TS--talked to Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 support. The Level 3 person assured me the problem was with Windows 7, but he could never show me where or why.I then tried a DLink DUB-H7 hub, and it works flawlessly with 6 HDs.I would not recommend this hub at all."
3,Nice while it lasted....,"I had this hub for several years but recently my mouse stopped working one day and it turned out to be the hub. I don't know that mine overheated (like others have reported) but after I realized that the mouse was fine and it was actually the hub, suddenly all of the various glitches that I had noticed in recent months made sense and I came to the realization that this hub had been dying a slow death for quite some time now.I intended to buy another but after reading some of the reviews here I went with a ""Plugable"" hub instead. I was a little unsure of the brand having never really heard of it before, but then I remember thinking the same thing about Belkin many years ago. I've always had good luck with Belkin but I chose not to take another chance on this hub.5 stars for an excellent product from a design and usability point of view, but minus 2 stars for slowly dying after only a few years."
2,Not long lived,"Worked fine for about a year or so, but then developed overheating related issues where a number of ports became non-functional."
3,It's ok,"This looks nice and doesn't take up too much of a footprint on your desk, but the thing overheats very easily. I have to make sure to keep something underneath it to let it air out or it locks up and quits working. 9 months with it and I think I'll look at getting another brand."
2,Good while it lasted,"I own this hub for about 2 years. The design made it easy to use with the two usb ports on the top. Clean look will all other usb connections in the back. Today, the hub stop working. I rebooted the device, but it refuse to show my usb items. I disconnected my mouse and keyboard, and connect direct to the computer and it work. Therefore, I know that this nice hub is now dead. I recommend that you shop for another hub from another manufacture since it look like Belkin is making a poor product."
5,Works just fine. 2 Stacked,I have two of them stacked. Use them for my laptop so I only have to plug in one usb cable.I think its cheaper at walmart dot com though.
2,"Ran Hot, Died Early","Purchased in December, 2007, this hub worked OK for about 7 months until it began causing hangs and slow-downs on an iMac. When disconnecting, it was almost too hot to touch. Once the hub was removed, the computer returned to normal operation."
2,Had 2 units die,"I love the design of this unit, and it's very convenient having the ports on top for quick connect of thumb drives. However, I had one die after using it awhile. Belkin replaced it for free, but after I loaded this one up with devices and used it for a bit, it died as well. I really need all the ports because I have many items connected to a notebook with only 2 internal ports, but I'm going to give up on Belkin and look for a different hub to replace this one. Reports here talk about overheating, so maybe someone could get by if they don't have much connected to it. For reference, I have the following on mine: printer, keyboard, smartphone, headset, external hard drive (2 ports), USB cooling pad."
1,Anything BUT Belkin from now on,"This is the second Belkin hub I have purchased. It will not power any usb device I plug into it, and my computer will only intermittently recognize any device I plug into. However, if I disconnect the hub and use that same port that I use for the hub, everything works correctly.The larger problem though, is when I left my mp3 player plugged into it as a test to see if it would eventually charge (it did not), when I grabbed the hub to disconnect the usb, it was too hot to touch. This is a definite safety hazzard. I replaced my last non-functioning hub (also a Belkin, but on a different computer) with this. After wasting my money twice I have learned my lesson."
2,OK for a while...,"This hub intitially seemed like a good idea but it tends to slip off the desk top since it's so light, but functioned as designed--for about 6 months. I have just spent nearly four hours trying to determine why my printer stopped working. I even contacted Smart Computing Magazine's free tech support for advice. After removing add-ons, reinstalling the HP printer, rebooting countless times, and before using the hammer-fix, I unplugged the printer cable from this hub and plugged directly into the computer's USB port and of course, it worked as before. This Belkin hub was used for the original printer installation and in service for about six months before ""dying"" from no appararent cause. Other ports seem to be still active...only the port into which the printer was plugged is useless. Indicates to me this is not a good quality hub..especially considering the cost."
2,One of the USB ports was not recognized,"I had 4-ports Belking device and it worked just fine. Then I replaced it with 7-ports, and it stopped recognizing my Blackberry despite rebooting, unplugging, reinstalling software etc. I am back to my old 4-ports device that still works fine."
2,Top ports quit,"I've had two of these for a year or so and was quite satisfied until we moved and when I set everything up again, the top two ports quit working on one of them. These were very handy for syncing my iPhone or downloading photos from a camera. Now I need a third USB Hub, but I'm not going to get another one of these."
1,Do not buy these unless you only need a hub for a month,"I bought 3 of these. The first one died shortly after a month, the second one lasted almost 3 months, and the third made it 9 months before it died. I used to think Belkin made good products, but these things are garbage."
5,Reliable hub,"I went through two other, cheaper USB 2.0 hubs that didn't work before I settled on this one on sale. This one provides reliable power to the other devices - Logitech and Philips webcams, card reader, Bluetooth adapter, Blackberry, Bluetooth headset. Disconnection also works properly. This is much more than I can say for the other hubs. Nice !"
5,Compact and easy. UPDATE: dies after 6 months.,worked like a charm right out of the box. nice accessible design.UPDATE: This hub died within 6 months. Nice physical design but bad quality. I would downgrade this to 1 star if I could
2,It's bloody huge,"This is about 5.5"" across and 4"" deep. Sheesh, there are laptop computers about that size. It's much bigger than it needs to be. Sure, it's sorta thin, but it's just a hub, it doesn't need to take up lots of scarce real estate. No wonder they don't mention the dimensions here or at the Belkin site.And in case it's not clear, the upturned part does not swivel down into the gap, or anything like that. Apparently it's meant to allow these to be stacked."
1,One year on and overheated and failed,"Fine until a year later the mouse pointer stopping and starting on the screen.I noticed the hub was hot, unplugged and let it cool and start again.,The problem then started more frequently and the unit became very hot.Had to toss it in the end.Won't buy Belkin again."
2,bad ports and overheating,"I bought two of these. The first got super hot and several ports did not work.The second ran cooler, but after a few hours, a couple of ports stopped working.Makes a attractive paperweight though."
2,My hub only lasted 15 months,"I purchased this hub in April of 2006. This past week, it went dead on me. I tried moving it around to a USB port on my Mac that I know works, and still nothing. The green light indicating a connection to the computer is dead. It was nice while it lasted - that's why it doesn't get 1 star - but I'm used to having electronics last longer than just over a year. Disappointed.-jwt"
2,burnt out 2 of them,"Bought this from David Jones Sydney city store (first one). Really like the 2 vertical ports in the centre of the device.Sadly the first one burnt-out after about 6 months, the second one (bought elsewhere - can't remember where) burnt-out after about a year (today!).If you're happy to replace it every-once-in-a-while then go for it, otherwise stay away.I won't be buying a Belkin USB hub again."
2,only good for 7 months,"I purchased this hub in August 08, and for the first 7 months, it worked well. But recently the devices connected to it kept droping connection from time to time. My mac kept mounting the external disk from time to time, and my printer software kept poping up connection error window. The most annoying thing is my wireless mouse, it lost connection very often. I have to get rid of it, and change for another hub.By the way, it would get quite hot if you have it working days and nights."
4,Interesting Features for an average story,"This wasn't a bad start to the Tom Baker era but I wouldn't put it up there in my Top 10 favorite Tom Baker stories. Baker's quirky humor is evident right off the bat and his chemistry with Elisabeth Sladen is already working. This pairing has always been a favorite Doctor-Companion team. But the story is still a King Kong wanna be and yet another UNIT story.What I like about this DVD are the features including the documentary about Baker's introduction as well as the development of the opening theme credits. The release of this DVD nearly completes the release of Baker's first season. I'm still waiting for ""Revenge of the Cybermen"" to complete it. Hopefully someday soon...."
5,The Greatest Doctor Begins Here!,"1974's ""Robot"" marked what would become the Greatest Doctor Who Era ever! It's was this four-part adventure by Terrance Dicks that would marked the beginning of the Tom Baker Era. The Era would lasted seven years (The Longest Era of the original BBC run of Doctor Who), and through there would other Doctor Whos after Baker, none would match the humor and thrill of Tom Baker.Add this to your must-own Doctor Who collection."
4,The first story by the Fourth Doctor.,"This is Tom Baker's first episode as the newly regenerated Fourth Doctor. He does a pretty good performance of the zany and confused Time Lord, and Sara Jane Smith is his Companion in the episode. This is one of the Earth-bound episodes, but it makes up for this by having a pretty good story, and excellent interactions with the usual team from UNIT, including the Brigadier. The main menace is the titular Robot, who is portrayed with some depth, and is an unwilling villian. The real baddies are a group of evil scientist who have a Nazi-like secret organization bent on creating a new world order. A pretty nice episode from the very beginning of the Fourth Doctor's run."
3,Only worth it for die-hard Tom Baker fans,"I have been a fan of Dr Who since I first happened upon it on a Saturday morning television. Tom Baker was already the Doctor and no one else fascinated or charmed me in that role like he did and continues to. That being said, this is one of the worst episodes I have seen. It was the first Tom Baker episode and they had not yet figured out exactly who the new character was yet. The robot was pretty silly looking, but an excellent piece of work considering the time period and budget constraints they were under. The story just doesn't work if you are over the age of 14. The extras on the DVD however are great. The interviews with Tom Baker were worth the price of the DVD to me. There is a featurette on the making or the tunnel effect that became the opening title sequence. This is a DVD for deep-geek Dr Who fans. =)"
5,Great fun for the whole family,I purchased this game for my 6 year old son. This Game Boy game allows our whole family to play together and allows different levels for the more experienced gamer and less experienced gamer. We have spent hours playing as a family. This is a great game for all ages.
2,Bit of a disapointment,"I'm a huge fan, but I felt this was one book too far. The idea seemed forced, and I struggled to keep my interest up"
3,Manitou Blood,"This is definitely Masterton at his best.I would readily rate it 2nd best after the ""Burial"" in the Manitou series.Full of bloody gore and horrific deaths,Masterton brings you personally into Harry's world.You can practically see it happening in front of you,a world full of dead vampires and without hope.Be warn! But read it anyway!"
4,she loves it,"this is a cute little desk, We live in an apartment so those big art desks are not an option I was worried it would be too small for my larger than average 3 yr old but she fits fine . You have to be careful when unpacking this though you could accidently throw out some stuff The screws for mine were in with the stampers and the crayons and some other stuff were attached to the inside of some cardboard that just looked like packing material If you are not looking for it you wouldn't find it. The only problem I have with this desk is my daughter drew on it with crayon , and it will not come off How do you make a kids activity desk that doesn't resist crayon marks???"
4,Child just loves this desk,"My daughter received this for Christmas and it is still one of her favorite items that she received. The leappad came with one book, that book has several different pages to learn letters, shapes, numbers and body parts. It also does colors. Along with games for an each teaching method. She also knows where the volume control is on the pages, and that she can do more than just one thing on the pages. As far as the desk itself goes, I gave this 4 stars for a few reasons - 1) the ink pad stains the desk {unless you use Mr Cleans magic easer} 2) crayons and markers stain the desk as well.My daughter also loves to trace the letters with the cut-outs. The book has all sorts of different ways for children to learn to write the letters."
5,Great work space and comes with the My First Leap Pad,"Our almost 3 year old son received this as a Christmas gift and loves it. The desk right out of the box was a cinch to assemble. All the legs simply snap in. Six screws hold in the little cubby hole/tray and other than that - I had it assembled in about 10 minutes.The My First Leap Pad that comes with this desk is specifically designed to sit/secure on top. The leap pad can be removed for extra space - like coloring or other projects. The basic book for the Leap Pad is a variety of ABC's, shapes, music, and so on. A great little beginner book.The desk also comes with several stencils, stamps, ink pad, crayons (NOT the washable type) all of which have their own space to stash.Overall, this is a great toy and one I'd recommend to anyone. It is designed for small bodies and hands, doesn't take up alot of space, is educational and very functional."
1,LeapFrog gets a thumbs down for this one,"This is the absolute worse toy I have ever purchased! The leappad broke in a matter of weeks. The pen no longer activates the pages. Although my daughter liked the leappad the actual desk table space is to small to really use. I had to run out to get another My First Leappad (...)because she loves it so much especially while using the potty. Don't waste your money on this useless toy, buy the Leappad seperately and get a good little tikes table."
1,Not for Lefties !,"The Leap Pad attaches to the left side of the desk, leaving the ""doodle"" space on the right. If you're a leftie, you can't reach across the Leappad to use the space. Also, the pen is attached to the right, so you have to stretch it across the pad. I called the company to ask if they had a way for the Leap Pad to attach to the right side of the desk but they don't. They suggested that I just remove the pad to use it, but then, what's the use of the desk?"
2,Salt masks the Teriyaki flavor,"Each 1.8 oz package contains 1220mg of sodium. I know that jerky isn't healthfood, but it gets very hard to eat more than a couple of pieces before the salt taste overcomes you."
3,Review,"The product was good, but in the end was a little pricy for the quanity received. 3 stars, two were deducted for price."
4,Insightful!,"Sidney Homer and Martin L. Leibowitz, the authors of this slim volume, accomplish a tough feat. They utter a piece of rudimentary financial advice in one sentence and then launch into mind-bending explanations of the calculus that makes the rudiments true. Maybe that's why their 1972 classic has been in print for three decades. This updated version of the classic includes new forewords and some material that was cut from the original. Unless you're an experienced bond trader or a finance whiz, this primer isn't exactly easy reading. The authors waste little time on hand-holding. Still, it remains a complete look at its topic after all these years. We suggest this book to investors and traders who need a crash course - or a refresher course - in bond analysis."
2,"Confusing, Boring, and a Let Down","I bought this book with much anticipation from the previous reviews I read. Boy, was I let down. It was an unfilling read, and very confusing. The time period jumps were not clear, and the book was just idle words without any meaning. If you asked me what the book was about, I would falter in giving you a clear description. There was no depth. Don't waste your money, more importantly don't waste your time."
2,Buyer Not Thrilled!,Toy is supposed to be super tuff so I figured that I would spend a little more $ on it.Within the first 20 min. My Jack Russel had the top of the toy broke open and some of the stuffing pulled out. By the end of the day he had the squeeker from the top pulled out too. I will never waste my $ on these supposed tuff toys again. Between the price of the toy & shipping- It's very expensive for a toy that doesn't meet the Hype!
2,Not indestructible,"First, the seller is fabulous. The product arrived quickly and there were absolutely no problems with that aspect of the order. However, this product has been advertised (by the maker, again, not the seller) as being indestructible. Not even close. It didn't make it 24 hours before there was stuffing all over the floor, and shortly after, our dog was pulling the squeakers out one by one. In all fairness, the legs of the toy lasted longer than most. the double stiching there and elsewhere is great, but the head of the octopus was the easy entry for our dog to be able to access the stuffing inside! Perhaps they make another toy that doesn't have such a large head, and it might last longer in our house then!"
2,not for serious chewers,My dog ripped this to pieces in a few hours. He did enjoy it but I had hoped for a toy that would last longer. My dog is a SERIOUS chewer so it may be fine for other dogs.
3,good toy,"I agree with above reviewer. My guys have had this toy for over a year. The head was the first to go in very short order. I revamped the resewed the head and they are still playing tug of war with it. The legs have lasted. I have purchased other toys from this manufacturer, they grade according to tuffness. The others I have purchased have been graded 9 and 10(the tuffest) and they are lasting my two chew crazy Boston Terriers far longer than any toy except Kongs. I would recommend"
1,Total cost: about a dollar a minute,"I had such high hopes for this toy - after my dog destroyed Captain Kurklops in about 45 minutes by chewing through his mouth, I thought for sure this one wouldn't have any weak spots. But she decided to perform brain surgery on this poor octopus and chewed straight through his head in about 20 minutes. Side note - you wouldn't believe how much stuffing is in one of these little guys! If you have a really strong, determined chewer you may end up disappointed too. My dog is a year-old bull terrier and she is really hard on toys. The Tuffy eel is the only one that lasted months for us."
1,Tuffy this toy is NOT!,My dog is quite the chewer I must say. He is a beagle (mixed with something im not too sure). If your dog is the type of dog that will chew and chew and chew at something with a vengeance then this toy is not for you.
2,Too tough for chewing and playing,"Our 60 pound golden retriever found this toy ""too tough"" to really pick up and chew... and play with. Couldn't make it squeak and it was awkward to pick up... she hasn't played with it at all. Definitely appears sturdy though."
4,Dog Shredder,"I have a 90 pound dog that loves to shred toys. This toy lasted an entire 6 months, a record! The part of the toy that my dog liked the best was that each octopus arm had a squeaker in it. So if one arm was shredded and the squeaker broken, there were others to be left for next time."
3,"Tougher Than Some, But Still Didn't Last","I bought this toy because I thought, ""Hey, a $20 toy is bound to last longer than a dollar store toy!"". Turns out this toy isn't too much stronger than any other. I have half a mind to start my own dog toy company. NO ONE creates a plush toy for dogs that is ""tough"". My dogs aren't even super strong chewers. They're just very persistent."
4,Happy puppies,"I bought this one and the ""Shack Shark"" as secret santa toys for my local dog shelter. It made me so happy to see new puppy arrivals chewing on them and being happy! I can't vouch for how long they lasted, since toys always disappear, but it certainly seemed to be able to withstand some good pitbull puppy abuse :)"
3,It is larger than I thought it would be.,Our puppy is quite the chewer. He is a medium size dog. Most toys do not last very long. The material of this one seems to be stronger than most with stronger edging also. We don't let our dog play with it unsupervised and only for short periods of time. It seems more durable than most toys.
2,"Ultimately, not so tough","It took my five-month old puppy about 5 minutes to chew a hole in this thing and start pulling the stuffing out. Hooked once again by baseless manufacturer claims, shame on me. Don't be fooled."
1,Destroyed,I loved the idea of this toy but our dog destroyed it in less then a month. She was a teething terrier mix and used her little pointy teeth to dig at the seems - but it lasted about 25 days longer then most of her other toys.We are now sticking to balls and bones!
3,Not worth the money if your dog is a serious chewer,I have a Chocolate Lab that mainly chews on logs and other blocks of wood I have laying around to feed the fire place. I wanted something the wouldn't make a large mess like all of the wood shards so I got her the octopus to chew on. She ripped it completely apart in and hour and twenty minutes. For the money I spent on it I was hopping it would last at least two weeks.
1,"not the octopus, but the stingray","I actually bought the stingray, not the octopus, but they were rated the same (I believe). I saw them both in the store and thought the stingray looked tougher because there was less fabric with stuffing.Yeah, my dog had the thing chewed apart, stuffing everywhere, in under 5 minutes.She's a pretty aggressive chewer, so I wasn't entirely surprised, but I think these toys are aimed at aggressive chewers. If your dog destroys toys, don't bother. I've had $3 toys last longer than this $16 one."
4,A must for submarine model builders,"About a 100 good quality of US WWII fleet submarines plus many diagrams and paintings of US subs, armaments, radars and conning tower variations. Good closeup of some of the details that you don't normally get in more conventional submarine books. S-Boats, Argonaut, Narwhal, Dolphin, Cachalot, P-class, Sargo, Tambor, plus the ubiquitous Gato and Balao class boats. If you are a budding fleet submarine model builder you need this book and the Floating Drydocks ""Plan Book - Gato & Balao Class Submarines."" The only weakness of this book is that it is a little expensive... for a 50 page book."
5,"Locations, contact information, & extensive descriptions","The Glaciers' Treasure Trove: A Field Guide To The Lake Michigan Riviera by Jacqueline Widmar Stewart is a full-color travel guide to the sights, lakes, vineyards, state parks and other attractions of the area. Locations, contact information, extensive descriptions and photographs on every page characterize and enhanced this exceptionally useful, on-the-go, ""pocket portable"" traveling companion. A spiral binding and sturdy allows this handy reference to weather extensive use while one enjoying the best a Lake Michigan vacation has to offer."
2,I think you can find something better,"I bought this and a similar version from micracle suit, I like the micracle suit better. This rolls down and doesn't hold my stomach in that much. I am 5'3 and 120 pounds and had a baby 1yr. ago and I have a little pudgy stomach. I think you would be able to find something better than this."
2,It's a no go...,"I received two of these in the mail today and was excited to give them a try. Unfortunately they just don't live up to the description. While the rise is indeed high, which is what I wanted, the back immediately begins to slip down and bunches up under the rib cage. The weave around the buttocks, meant to enhance that area, instead just feels strange and is also a bit bunch-y. My search for the perfect hi-waist briefer continues."
5,Clear lucid very readable book!,An outstanding book! It explains the mathematics underlying derivatives extremely well. The author's style is very clear and it is a pleasure to read.I highly recommend this book!
2,Scholars only,"I believe that a good history book should be more than even brilliant scholarship. It should be interesting. It should tantalize the reader to go deeper into the subject. It should convey to the reader the author's love of the subject... why the book is worth the reader's valuable time (and money). Scholarly and readable are not contradictory terms.If you share this belief, then avoid Mr. Tester's book. I'm sure the scholarship is fine (just like your high school history text). But this book isn't fun; this book isn't interesting, it's a bore. The erudite Mr. Tester shows no emotion, wit or enthusiasm in this numbing display of pedantry.My guess is that Mr. Tester was from the ""no pain, no gain"" school of education: learning isn't meant to be easy. One can struggle through a chapter, have dinner, and completely forget what one has just read...I mean completely! It's really amazing how one can take a topic as intrinsically interesting as astrology and turn it into lifeless trivia."
4,Basic product that teaches a basic skill,"I like this game and think that it does a good job of teaching symbols that relate to sounds heard in words, rhyming and spelling three letter words. It is pretty basic and only covers rhyming and spelling. All the child needs to know how to do is point and click to play the game. Also, it usually does not take a child long to complete the entire game. I would recommend it for an average PreK-K and for students that are having problems with rhyming three letter words and spelling three letter words."
4,Great Short Stories by American Women,"""Great Short Stories by American Women"" would be better titled ""Short Stories by 19th Century Women."" Although it is a new addition, the book does not encompass nearly enough genres of American Women. The highlight of the book is ""The Yellow Wall Paper"" by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. This Naturalistic story most accurately portrays the plight of women stuck in their unhappy gender role."
1,Zero stars,"According to the product's label it:- Kills wasps, hornets and yellow jackets and eliminates the nests where they live and breed.- Kills dangerous pests on contact.- 27-foot jet spray lets you keep a safe distance while you eliminate wasps and hornets in their hard-to-reach nests.I've used this product on the same wasp nest for a week every other day only to watch the nest and its population grow and thrive. The nest probably doubled in size. Using it to try to take down a single airborne wasp wasn't much better than a squirt bottle of water. Most other brands foam up and prevent the wasps from flying. The Spectracide side product remains a liquid and many wasps easily flew 25 feet or more to a nearby tree.I feel lucky I wasn't stung. Use at your own peril."
2,Spectracide Wasp and Hornet spray,Spectracide wasp and hornet sprayThe Can was damaged when it arrived and the plastic cap that fits on the top--completely shattered in about eight pieces--so a packing issue! I still have been using the can because it seems to work and the product itself is great and works well.
2,Ehh nopt so great but it works,"ive always bought the commercial version of the spectracide spray and tried this one because its half the price, well now i know why.this spray isnt as effective at all like the commercial version, when you spray the nest they still move around and still fly away also when you spray just the bee flying it isnt effective at all where as with the commercial version in the silver can will kill them instantly even if you only got a mist on them flying away"
5,Great Instructional Sculpting Source,I purchased this DVD as a means of preparing/instructing myself in the art of sculpting prior to teaching this in my own junior high Art classroom. After viewing this DVD I then played it it in my classroom because it was so informative and educational. It is an exceptional DVD and I encourage beginners or expert sculptors to get their own copy because its information is guaranteed to make you a better sculptor.
5,Swamp Loggers,An excellent DVD. Gives a real life look at the ups & downs of logging. I highly recommand this product.
1,Do not buy this c.d. if you like chris's mix sets!,"The Greek's mix's are hot, however this cd is different. It is nothing like his mix set, it is more like Club 69 or Lords of Acid. If you like Club 69 and Lords of Acid, this would be a really good buy for you. The reason I gave it one star is because of the one good track,""Anxiety."" Other wise, this cd blows."
3,too damn short,"it was a good DVD, dont get me wrong..... there could have just been *more* of it.... If you love Loreena McKennitt, this is something one really must have- but i just wish it was so much longer.... i mean really- she has so much more material than was covered in this dvd."
4,A Good Introduction To Loreena,"If you've never heard her music, or seen her in concert, this is a wonderful way to be introduced. But for the long time Loreena fan, this might be a little disappointing as you long for more at the end of the documentry."
3,Very informative.,"I expected this to be more of a music video than a commentary. I should have done my homework before I bought it. The commentary was done very well. The music videos of ""The Bonny Swans"" and ""The Mummers' Dance"" were very enjoyable. I have yet to view or listen to the snippets offerred on the dvd of other songs from her cd's yet. I have all her cds with the full song versions.As I said, I should have done my homework. I am happy that I did not pay the price that stores and some websites are charging for this dvd."
3,read the small print,"I honestly thought I was getting a CD, not a DVD.....will wait for her next new CD to come out"
5,I love this cd.,the music sounds great and good tones that gets me in the mood. I was wonder when is the anime show going to hit North America.
3,Just O.K.,"Educational philosophy swings back and forth throughoutthe years, and political correctness changes with the times.Some things that are called philosophy today, have beenconsidered just ""common sense"" by good teachers of the past.This puts ""some"" of that into print. But, be a critical reader."
3,Reasonable,"The item took a long time till it was shipped, and it's not exactly the one ordered - the one ordered is ""American Literacy - what every american needs to know"", and we received the dictionary, not the same book"
2,Warning: Deceptive title,"Eek! I thought this book would include ""What Every American Needs to Know,"" since that's the subtitle. Stuff like: ""Zeitgeist means 'spirit of the time,' from the German zeit, meaning time, and geist, meaning soul or spirit."" Instead, Hirsch's book merely *lists* Zeitgeist as a concept we should understand. Um... so why isn't the subtitle ""A LIST of What Every American Needs to Know, But Not the Actual Information.""Finally, was there really no way for Hirsch to make his points without veiled insults at his son? Why does he need to mention his son at all?"
5,The Most Definitive Book on Educational Theory of the 20th Century,"Every American educator and most Americans in general need to read this book. It is the most ground breaking text to be written in the United States in the last 100 years. If all schoolboards and educators used this as a guide, we wouldn't have a problem with public education in this country. Unfortunately, the people who need to read it most, will be the ones who won't understand its message. Such is the paradox in American education today.Do not confuse this book with its companion text ""A Dictionary of Cultural Literacy"", which several reviewers have done. The original explains Hirsch's theory of ""necessary knowledge"" and the latter gives brief explanations of all of the items listed in his original book. I agree with one reviewer that a bit more information on each item would be better in the ""Dictionary"", but it is already a large volume as it is.Rene Navarre, MBAInstructor, Remington College"
2,Cultural Literacy - Knowledge isn't Facts,"Hirsch make many mistakes in his book, some omission, some of commission. Perhaps the most troubling is his notion that facts are knowledge. That is not a useful idea for anyone involved in education.A core problem in our culture are books of lists. The curriculum, for the most part, is a mile wide and an inch deep. Hirsch's book does little about this, and in fact exacerbates the problem. Murray Gell-Mann, a scientist at MIT once remarked that, ""education in the United States is like being taken to the world's greatest restaurant and being fed the menu."" The Hirsch book helps cultivate a taste for menus."
3,OH THAT LIST!,"In his treatise on the (lowly) state of US public education, Hirsch seems to stop short of theorizing his hypothesis. In fact, he appears as guilty of short changing students as the institutions he decries. I do not fully comprehend his want of a national core cirricullum, or how such a method would result in a nation of better readers. It seems to me that diversity is more important than a single national web of knowledge. I understand that if his list of 5,000 facts contained even a sample of the item, this book would be too cumbersome for bookstores. What I don't understand is why Babe Ruth is on the list, and Hank Aaron is not. Did someone say ""elitism""?"
1,Nifty floor mats and carid suck,"Nifty floor mats didnt come close fitting my 2007 chevy silverado, it took 12 working days to get my money from CARID after I had to send pictures showing they didnt fit. 7 working days to get am RMA and another 5 working days after they received the product back. NEVER order from CARID or nifty floor mats but if you do and get Brian B with Carid as your contact just hope you dont have to return the product."
4,May the Chronicles continue forever!,"I can't believe these books are available for so little! After reading Neptune Crossing I purchased Strange Attractors and The Infinite Sea and enjoyed them all. I like the way events take the group off-course often and take them to entirely different worlds. This series has memorable characters that are alien to the core and expand my concept of what ""life"" is.Chaos Chronicles are about chaos and what can become of it in a sci-fi writers mind.This is a great series to curl up with and just enjoy."
4,Wet Dream,"If the authors intent was to create an atmosphere drenched in claustrophobia and almost depressing doom he succeded. From the crowded interstellar space craft to the deep underwater world of small, low ceiling habitats and submarines, this story leaves you conscious of every breath you take. You can almost smell the dampness and the odors of the sea.While I have enjoyed reading Jeff Carvers trilogy, I have to admit it was not my favorite book of the three. Still it managed to be entertaining and tied in well with the other two books. I did find that this story was maybe a little too predictable, as I had figured out the ending very early in the book."
2,Neat Idea.,"The plot was a little jerky at times. However, the storyline moved forward nicely. The inteaction with the aliens was nicely done. There was a completely unnecessary alien sex scene that took a lot away for me."
2,"Not for the 520, only the later models","This manual has no specs/data for the 520 engines, only for the L-16 and L-18, and this manual is mostly data. Much of it is still relevant for non-engine, specs-unnecessary repairs, but if you're looking for a manual with 520 data don't waste your money like I did."
2,Basskraft,'It's more fun to compute' and 'A digital world' are good tracks. The vocals are a big dissapointment. Not to be compared with Kraftwerk.
4,Nice Tomahawk,"I thought I was buying a replacement handle but got a nice tomahawk instead. How about ""with Hickory Handle"" in the label."
4,tomahawk,I like this tomahawk. The handles are not the greatest and will be replaced soon with a stronger wood but have held up so far. The balance of this hawk is wonderful and I never miss.
4,Solid Entertainment,"I know it has become fashionable to declare :""I hate reality TV"", and for those dear souls this would be torture. I, quite frankly. LOVE good reality TV and Survivor is a WONDERFUL idea for this genre of television -very well executed, with clever editing and sound (granted - sometimes used in a partial way to influence the viewer's stance towards an idea/person/sub-plot)and has very high production values. I enjoyed watching the ALL-STARS again, especially to see (in hindsight) the shenanigans of Boston Rob and the gradual budding romance with Amber! Great to see familiar faces in new surroundings - for example the original ""master"" Richard and the unofficial winner of series 2 Colby, ""only-to-be-understood-when-you-are-drunk-yourself"" Big Tom etc etc Lots of extras and also commentary tracks on some episodes. Would have liked to hear more background on the Sue ""(scream)I WAS VIOLATED"" incident, but that was somehow snuffed. Great entertainment."
4,"Pretty good season, EVERYONE was affaid to play the game!!","It was a pretty good season, but everyone was affaid to make moves in the game. They made alliances on day 2 and stuck with them even though it made them come in 4th, 5th place. The people that wouldn't be affaid of making moves were voted off early or couldn't because players would not budge. It had some great moments in the season too. Like Rich ""rubbing"" Sue, Sue's break down and then ripping Jeff a new one, Jenna's mom, the godfather move that Boston Rob did to Lex, Boston Robb calling Big Tom son dumb and the Jury meltdown. Also the cast commentaries was great. You could clearly hear that these people have not gotten over it. A fight happen between Shi-ann and Alicia in the commentaries. Also Lex hates Robb so much that he saw some kids with a Boston Redsocks hat and wanted to hurt them. Now that it's under 30 dollars it differnly worth the purchase if your a survivor fan."
3,Brutal,"This was a brutal season. It was not ment to be played by friends. Their were no allies (other the Rob and Amber) and it was the Rob and Amber show. You just got tired of it. The challenges were the same as the other seasons. But you had some good people. You had Rupert, Shi Ann, Tina (for three days), Big Tom, Lex, and Eathen. Trust me on this, on know Survivor."
1,Awful!,"With the exceptions of the Richard Hatch & Susan Hawk fights, this show ended up being a real stinker.And the fact that they just gave Rupert an extra million cause ""people just love him"" was lame and a total slap in the face to previous Survivor participants.Susan Hawk so called it right when it was announced...""Well looks like Rupert's going to walk away with a million.""Dispicable."
3,No Johnny Rotten?,"This season of survivor could have been much better if it had included Johnny Rotten. He was obviously one of thee most memorable and infamous characters ever on the show. The man lied about his grandmother dying to get ahead in the game. Instead the cast is filled by people like Shi Ann, who are annoying and forgetable"
4,Better than I remembered,"I watched the All-Star season when it aired. After Boston Rob's win, we decided we wanted to watch the all star season. It was great to watch again - even knowing the outcome."
4,Survivor fan,"I enjoyed this season of Survivor. The packaging of the disks tell you who will be voted off and who will be the winner. For those of us that want it to be a surprise, this is disappointing."
5,Survivor All Stars - Packaging Blunder,Absolutely the best Survivor Season. Loved it!Spoiler Alert!!!!! - The person voted off on each episode is printed on the disc cover for each individual episode.The people in charge of this blunder aren't very smart. Thanks a lot.After paying a large chunk of money I sure didn't want to know the outcome before viewing. Dumb!
5,Sells well,"I hope Survivor All Stars sells well on dvd, because if it does then they might make the other seasons on dvd. I also hope the next dvd release is outback. Whoever makes the survivor dvd should make the other ones to. So I hope everybody buys one of these on dvd so that the other seasons will come to dvd."
3,Couldn't stand the hero.,"After reading this book I've concluded that I just can't stomach the alpha male heroes in this author's early books. The totally unsubtle, slam-bam-thank-you-mam approach is just too over-the-top for me. I have also been consistently disappointed by this author's love scenes, and her inability to credibly portray sexual chemistry between her lead characters. I liked how the heroine constantly kept the hero on his toes, but he was just plain tiresome. I'll stick to this author's more recent works."
5,One of Krentz' best!,"This was one of the first novels I read from Jayne Ann Krentz. Hugh is the kind of man every woman wants, just enough arrogance to make you realize he's a man, and just enough tenderness to make you fall in love. Maddie is the typically high strung executive woman trying to eke out an acceptable career that will keep her in close contact with her artsy family. She is insecure in her job and her looks. When she was rejected by Hugh (after having had a flasy romance with Maddie's flamboyant beautiful sister), Maddie is not very willing to give it another try. Hugh comes to realize Maddie was the best thing that ever happend to him. A fun and exciting and passionate read while he does everything he can to get her back into his life an d the people they run into trying with all their might to seperate them. I loved this book!"
4,Great read,"Although I've read Ms. Krentz's books, under the nom de plume of Amanda Quick, I've just ""discovered"" her other works of written delight! This is another great read!"
2,A disappointment,"I know that romance novels are a lot harder to write than would appear and the constant search for new plots must be a headache for authors of this genre. Author, Judith Krentz was at the beginning of her career when she penned this one in 1997 and I am know very well that her plots and characters have improved since then!I struggled with Silver Linings, and by page 28 I was ready to give the whole thing a miss. A hero who continually calls the heroine ""Babe"" in every second sentence gives me the pip. I think Ms Krentz was trying for an ""Indiana Jones"" type adventurer, but it didn't come off.The hero, Hugh, who we never really get to know, and Mattie are uninteresting characters. I thought Hugh was crass and Mattie a right twit. Silk and Evangeline were far more interesting.Having skimmed a lot of the first part of the book, the second half started to pick up the pace a little and I finally staggered to the end which, predictably, wound up according to tradition in romance stories."
4,Very satisfied!,"The product took a while to get but I wasn't in a hurry to get it. Other than that I am very satisfied! It was basically just like the descriptions, some wear and tear but in good condition. I bought it for my mom, and I am happy to give it to her. I was a little concerned it would not be in good enough shape to give to someone as a gift, but it turned out to be just fine, considering that a brand new copy was over a $100! Thanks!"
2,Nice design but functionally flawed,"I bought these because I was looking for hanging kitchen towels without the use of hooks. I picked these over similar plastic models because of the stainless steel design. Turned out to be a classic ""form-over-function"" mistake. The grabbers are open at the bottom so the corners of (thinner) towels will glide right through! You really have carefully ""prepare"" your towel for hanging and hope you won't find it on the floor the next day. You should get one of the (much cheaper) plastic models that are closed at the bottom. They may not be as pretty, but do what they are supposed to do."
1,Looks Great but....,"We hoped to use this to hold a dish towel. But unless we folded the towel so several thicknesses of towel were caught in the hook, the towel easily slipped through."
3,not particularly thrilled,"I almost gave this 2 stars. First of all it is smaller than I expected measuring about 2"" x 2"". Apparently it was designed for hand and dish towels only. The sticky tape will NOT hold when a bath towel is inserted. You might as well be ready to drill a hole in it and screw it to the wall if you plan to use it for a larger towel. The slot seems small but even a bath towel will slip through if it is not stuffed or doubled. Other than that and with those caveats it is made out of indestructible brushed steel and should last indefinitely."
3,Won't stand up to kids,"The adhesive is pretty good, but the slot is too small for most towels, and forcing towels in or out takes the holder down"
5,"I had one of these several years ago, the best towel holder out there!",You can put this anywhere.Adding a screw makes it more secure.Allows the towel to dry when your finished.
2,towel holder,This towel holder detached itself and fell to the floor. Not what I had hoped. I had to use another product.
2,InterDesign Steel Forma Towel Grabber,"this item is solid and well-made, but the adhesive doesn't hold it in place. I had to affix it with super glue. This is one of my most disappointing purchases from Amazon.com. and I don't recommend it."
5,Looks great,"Very stylish towel/cloth holder in a nice stainless steel. Sturdy piece, not flimsy like some plastic holders, and a decent size so it will hold larger towels without issue. Item was packaged well and arrived pretty fast to Canada."
2,Not good,"I wouldn't recommend these. First of all, the two sides of the V are too far apart, so it doesn't grab a towel without a lot of effort. They just fall right out. I had a plastic one for years with a tight V that grabbed the towel with just a quick swipe downwards. Secondly, the adhesive on this failed after only two days :-( They're nice looking, so I wish they'd worked better."
1,$22 for one episode? Are they serious?,"Elsewhere on Amazon they have a 3 disc collection of Dirty Jobs, 494 minutes, for $17.This one seems to be one disc, one episode, for $22. It is significant that they do not have the number of discs or running time like they do with 98% of the DVD's Amazon sells. I assume it was the manufacturer and not Amazon that left it off, because Amazon seems concerned with customer satisfaction.My wife likes the show and I would like to buy an entire season, like any other tv show on DVD, for a reasonable price. If I somehow bought this one by accident I would be furious."
2,"Good show, but only one episode per disk!","Have enjoyed ""Dirty Jobs"" on TV for years, but nearly $20 for ONE Episode (less than one hour!) is insane. There are three jobs in the episode, but there should be at least twice as much material for the price."
2,Flatt and Scruggs Live,This album was not as good as I had hoped. The group seems to lack the fire and excitement I have heard from them on other cuts. Always nice to hear the boys...but this is not what I consider a great album and would not recommend it.
2,Spell Check!,"It's a very cute sign, and I like the humor and general idea; however, they misspelled ""reformatted"" as ""reformated"". Oops..."
1,LG Style-i Bluetooth headset,"I've used other headsets before, but when this item came I could not figure out how to use it. There was no ear piece included so that I could actually use the headset.I called the vendor and was told they were going to check on the product and get back to me, but no one ever called.I returned the product."
2,"Nice, but....",As long as you have a way to convert the external style USB connections to match the typical internal style USB ports on your motherboard the product is just fine.It seems odd to me that an internal device doesn't even come with an option for the typical internal connections.
4,rare indeed,"This film is Indie at its very best behind the facade of the quintessentialamerica is the truth of real life, and the reality that formed llana Lloyd and transformed her into the glitter godess of the sunset trip"
4,A Chickenhouse comes to life!,"Chickens- that is hens, roosters, and their babies- don't exactly lead fascinating lives. The kind that live on the farm stay put in their own little cramped, condo quarters, sweating out perspiration, laying eggs, and then, unwittingly, getting dispatched for the billions sold as McNuggets and in Chicken Noodle Soup. Their life's highlight is their own execution and an occasional feathers-flying, loud-screeching, mayhem-laden encounter with a fox. But not the chickens in William Rouse's ""Plucked Again!"" They sing (in Chinese, no less), dance, and party hardy. And their ringleader, a certain Most Ancient Chickenspokesperson (MAC) leads their harried and financially-strapped master/farmer named Flanker Fitzroy on a most amusing odyssey. Fitzroy, who acts HIMSELF like a chicken with its head cut off, enjoys partaking in rice wine and getting smashed to pieces with MAC, among other things. A perfect, quirky antidote to the techno-thriller. Recommended."
4,Great kit...but!,"My 12 year old son and I are just finishing this up. First and foremost, the magnets and part attachments that hold the two bottom panels will NOT keep them on. We used a hot glue gun that easily solved the problem, but it was intially very frustrating. Surprising that LEGO would have such a flawed design at this price. Recommend that two people work on this together and lay out the parts by type and size before beginning construction (we used clear baggies). Typical great LEGO instructions with a HUGE manual. Overall, an amazing kit with a design flaw. This thing is BIG!"
5,High WOW factor,"This was a lot fo fun to put together, and has given my son a target to shoot for with his own Lego projects. The cost is a tad on the high side, but it possesses such an impact on those who see it, as well as the hours savoring construction.There is another set out there now that is larger than this 3000ish set - the Millenium Falcon Ultimate series is topping 5000 pieces, but is also on the expensive side (more so that this set). It still does set the mind in gear.I will echo that a hard surface is a must, as is a dedicated space. This is not a set to work on in fits and starts unless you live alone and don't mind having pieces strewn about. The number of profiles alone makes for necessary sorting and planning for most of us.Overall, it was a great recapturing of the Lego experience, and it's opened the door to some other more complex display projects with my son, perhaps to begin a small collection. [If they could brign the price down a tad, this would make it easier, though...]"
5,Greatest Toy Ever,I am a Lego Master Builder and have built this toy in 3-4 hours.This is one of the best Star Wars building expiriences of all time. It is worth every penny!
1,don't bother with this one,"I've read many books on real estate, some average and some pretty good. After reading this book I can confidently say that it is the worst real estate book I've ever read.All the information it contains can be found in other books - all of them better written. This book is so boring that no matter how well rested I was, whenever I picked this book up I never failed to become sleepy within just a page or two! The book's sole saving grace: it was thankfully short."
1,workbook with no answers,full of questions and no answers...how do you test yourself on multiple choice questions with no answer key...? Pretty pointless. Going to return it asap.
1,Q & A work book!!!,This version (Workbook) of Modern Carpentry is a workbook. Its questions that you must fill in the blank (answer). It is NOT a book but more of a 'test' (I'm assuming) of the material in Modern Carpentry.
1,Worst idiots ever,They simply sent me the wrong book... the customer service guy wanted to help but would not listen correctly. if you order this chances are its the wrong book as it has happened to several kids in my class.
3,Secondary book needed,"As a student in carpentry class, I find this book simple, helpful and detailed. But, our class has found ourselves going to other book sources to answer specific carpentry questions. Whether the information on what we want to know is too vague or just non-existent this book leaves out some particulars. Overall, this is a good foundational reference as a supplement to other sources."
3,Secondary book needed,"As a student in carpentry class, I find this book simple, helpful and detailed. But, our class has found ourselves going to other book sources to answer specific carpentry questions. Needed information on particular subjects is either too vague or non-existent, as this book leaves out some details. Overall, this is a good foundational reference as a supplement to other sources."
4,better than expected,"despite being produced in 1984,recording-quality,image of album, everything is all right.'Not This Time'and 'Blue Kiss From Brazil' are really fab."
3,Just ok,"I'll start by admitting these things cop a beating with me. I wear my shoes for over 14 hours a day (in an office environment) and only rarely get comments about the smell now. For that I am very happy, however don't think I will buy them again. After about a month they have become far less effective and I don't think they will last much longer (and definitely as long as the year advertised).As a side note the trace provided is next to useless so just trace your foot, then cut it."
5,How to give Dark Music a good name,"I was priviledged to be friends with the owner of a record import store in the early 80's. Serge had a lot of vinyl for listening, and so he turned me on to a lot of music I otherwise might never have known about. This album marked a forray deep into dark music that I for one suggest is well taken in measured doses. This is music from places better visited than resided at.Highly recommended to those who enjoy walking in the woods after sunset."
4,"More 4,5 stars","I just discovered Univers Zero when I purchased this cd, two weeks ago. I'm not disapointed, not at all, every time i listen to the dark moods of this music, i enter in a gloom transe kind of feeling, this music is disturbed and has an almost horror soundtrack feeling, it takes over your imagination. These belgians have the dark feeling of their french neighbours Magma, but without the percussive madness of them. It's just slow. The despair of the strings get over ourselve slowly, is a slowly process, it's like the apocalipse aftermath. Have fun. I had and i'm having!"
3,"Great learning toy, lasts a year","I am on my third l-max in 2 years. My 5 yr old loves it, and it's a great educational toy while satisfying his thirst for video games. But Leapfrog has replaced it twice...one year apart. The first time, the LCD screen didn't work right (specifically - the pen did not allow accuracy on the screen). The second time, the screen ""froze"" and would not allow any play at all. After recalibration and rebooting attempts by the technicians at Leapfrog, they replaced the unit at no charge. My advice - buy the toy, but register your product on their website and keep track of all conversations and problems with your unit. And be aware that it takes persistance to get the unit replaced."
4,"Good Item, but if you have two kids, get two...","This is a great product. I bought it (the L-Max AND the charger) for my oldest daughter, for her fifth birthday, but I can't keep the two-year-old away from it... Very educational, too..."
1,A waste of money. Here's why...,"I bought this system and returned it the very next day. Why? Because for the price of this exhorbitant recharging system, you can buy two packages of four Ni-MH AA batteries that recharge in 15 minutes and last as just as long... even on one charge! And, the charging device that came with the Ni-MH batteries is much more compact. PLUS, when the L-Max eventually dies, you can still use Ni-MH batteries for other electronic devices. Let's see you do THAT with this recharging system! Don't be fooled folks. Save your money and buy quick charging Ni-MH batteries instead."
5,Battery Pack for charger,"My son is 5 and also loves his L-Max. With as much time as he spends with it, I like that he can actually learn something instead of just feed the mindless gaming habit.As for the battery pack, according to another review I've read, you can purchase just the battery pack directly from LeapFrog. I looked on their website and didn't find it, but I'm sure if you call their customer service, they would be happy to help.My only problem with the L-Max is that the games are so limited. My son is 5 and there are only about 4 games for his age group and even fewer as the kids get older. And for as much as you pay for the L-Max, I'd like it to last longer than 3rd or 4th grade."
3,OK,"A nice CD that pays tribute to the master himself. However it doesn't do an adequate job as a few of the remakes are drawn out and dull. But the jazzy One Note Samba, cast of neat musicians and terrific price lift this CD up over the half way mark."
5,Best of a great series,"I have enjoyed all of James Nelson's books in the Isaac Biddlecomb series, but this one is the best by far. Nelson's skill at characterization is in full force here. He creates believable, riviting people put in often impossible situations and reacting the way real people will. It is just not right to say the British are portrayed as evil - they get the same even treatment that the Americans do - not good, not bad, just people. On top of that, the plot moves at break-neck speed. Great reading! Though the first three books say ""Trilogy"" the last two say ""Saga"". Nelson's web site says he hopes to finish the Biddlecomb series some day, and I certainly hope he does! Also don't miss Nelson's Marlowe novels, starting with The Guardship."
2,Just a nice evening,"I was there, for this reason I bought it. But a reunion of great artists of jazz & rock in order to play blues and some welknown tunes does not make it a great band. Just a pleasant evening, not really any fusion or something magic ... But this is also the case in sport ..."
1,defective CD's,"The first CD I received was defective. I returned it and receivedthe replacement. It also wouldn't play. Amazon's response in bothcases was excellent as I expected. Someone needs to sample these CD's,however. It would seem unlikely that 2 would be defective. Probably thewhole batch is!!!!"
3,A little slow,"It was a little slow. Great players, but not much chemistry. I was glad that Clpaton wasn't the focal point, however."
1,Nice fridge until it died,"I bought this fridge in spring of 2004 for a camper.As such, I used it for 6 months of the year, in season, and then it sat idle for the other 6 months.It is well laid out, doesn't seem to frost up excessively, and, overall served us wellThe compressor froze up in Oct. of 2007. That's 2 years of actual use.That kind of life span is totally unacceptable. Maybe the other choices of this class of fridge are no better, but I'll never buy a Sunpentown again.Totally disappointed!"
4,Good-so far,So far the frig performs just as advertised. I don't particularly care for the inside configuration-but that's just a personal preference. The thing freezes and that's what I was looking for.
1,Less 1 year -Stopped working Light on but NOT cold,Fridge life was LESS than one year.... called company (little/no results) they said I would have to pay shipping for repair which was $65 - the rest would be covered by one year warranty.I purchased a different replacment fridge because of uncertainty that the repair would last long.Overall size = goodDurability = fair or short-livedMy rating: FAIR ===> I would have given a good rating IF it lasted for atleast 3 years
2,i would buy if...,I would love to buy 2 or 3 of these rings and stack them together!! Too bad that would bring the total to $60. I would buy if they were less priced!
2,Not a good fit,"The product build quality is good and it works with my blackberry.But its not a good fit for my ear, it comes out of the ear if I can manage to fit it in some home. The battery life is pathetic."
2,Didn't last long,"Worked fine for a couple of days, then broke. Wouldn't charge and power up. Might have been a fluke so 2 stars."
5,Libro encantador,"This adorable book caught my eye in a bookstore and I couldn't resist. Thank goodness it's a board book, because otherwise I'd have worn it out reading it to my baby nephew time and time again. The illustrations are colorful and charming, the language is TERRIFIC -- I've never seen the English version, but the translator(s) must be exceptionally talented to end up with these fun rhymes and unusual words. Only after reading it several times did I catch on that the rhymes are about each month in a baby's first year! The whole family came to enjoy this book, and it was lovely having a baby book that my husband could read aloud as easily as I could.(Incidentally, go looking for other books from the same publisher / distributor ... you'll be astonished by the quality. I discovered they were the publishers of a number of favorite children's books that I already owned.)Andrea"
4,Good instructional video,"This is a great video to watch and learn how to do the advanced variations of the classic Pilates sequence however, I thought it too fast to follow as a work out. I consider myself an intermediate Pilates practitioner and I found that by the time it took me to position myself for the next exercise, the instructor was almost ready to move onto the next. Be advised that only the advanced variations of sequence are shown--there are no beginner/intermediate modifications. The workout as a whole is about a half-hour long. It is followed by a reformer session. This is not something I know a lot about so I cannot comment. The initial sequence seems to be repeated immediately after, which I found strange. I didn't watch any more than that. Overall, I recommend the first thirty minutes of this video."
5,Great Album!,"This is one of Battlelore's best records. It is as good, if not better, than Sword's Song. They have made a lot of progress in the last few years and this album proves it. The balance between male and female vocals is perfect. This is a must own for any fan of metal/lotr."
1,Huge Disappointment,"This book is useful as a reference to the Indian War of 1865 only. Anyone merely looking for names, dates, and places will be well-served by this title. For those looking for an engaging read, look elsewhere. Author McDermott seems to sleep-walk through Circle of Fire. It's like reading a batch of research notes. McDermott barely bothered to put them into narrative form. At 175 pages (the rest of the ""book"" is taken up by notes, bibliography and index), the book is WAY too short. Couple this with McDermott's teeth-grindingly annoying insistance on referring to Indian raiders as ""avengers"" (ostensibly for Sand Creek), and this is a book to avoid at all costs.As a counterpoint, readers might want to look at ""Massacre Along the Medicine Road."" Although I detest the PC sensibilities of this title, it is beautifully written and a pleasure to read. McDermott makes frequent mention of it in Circle of Fire. Unfortunately, he wasn't more successful in emulating it."
5,Great Book,Another excellent book by a great author. This may be the definitive work on this subject. Great job keeping the balence of perspective between the Indians and the soldiers.
4,Good book on a not well known period,"This is a good book on a period of the west that is not well known. The author does a good job of researching his topic. Although the writing is somewhat dry and to the point, there appears to be little truthful that can be said and this period is not well documented. Some sections that I like especially where the early parts when about the Indian raiding that closed the roads in Colorado in 1865 and the fear that spread into Denver. The section on the Connor campaign in August/September was also interesting. Especially about the one unit attacked by thousands of Indians and the excerpts on Roman Nose who road in front of the soliders guns without getting touched. Although this isn't a great book, it is an interesting book and one worth looking at if you are interested in the Indian wars in the west."
5,Masterful...,"If Amazon gave six stars, I would give Circle of Fire six stars. This book is a masterful work; full of insight, interesting, and accessible to all history lovers. The chapter on ""Conclusions"" is one of the best pieces of analytical writing on the conditions, problems, and limitations of the Indian Wars that I have ever read. While the conclusions concern the Indian War of 1865, they are indeed applicable to the two succeeding decades of warfare."
5,"Surprise,surprise, surprise!","No, not Gomer Pyle [nor Jim Nabors]but a DJ that actually adds musical pleasure to making House or Trance music from great pieces of music. Figures, it would be a Brasiliano DJ. DJ Pedro selects wonderful Brasilian singers from a variety of styles-Tropicalisma, MPB and Bossa Nova, and using fancy recording stuff makes with the Disco Ball. But-it enhances the music. I won't be doing my John Travolta high stepping but the music is great to begin with and just gets better. If you love Brasilian music you are going to dig this the most."
5,This is the one you want by the people who know it best,This is a great introduction to doing basic yoga postures correctly. There is enough material in the three DVD set to keep a beginner occupied for quite some time. What is really wonderful is the
2,Not a favorite,"I am not so thrilled by these DVDs (although I haven't made it to the third one yet). I like the idea of the ""chalk talk"" and Natasha R's corrections to her assistant ""Summer,"" but for some reason Natasha's style ends up seeming condescending to me instead of supportive and encouraging. I also agree with the previous reviewer that something does not look right about her elbow alignment, so much so that I don't even like to watch her. Although they are packed with good information, these just aren't DVDs I look forward to using. I like Tracey Rich's ""Original Total Yoga,"" Suzanne Deason's ""Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss,"" and Patricia Walden's ""Yoga for Beginners"" much better."
3,Funny moments,"While this movie could not be considered wildly funny it did have funny moments.Unfortunately the funny moments could not be strung together well enough to make for a funny movie.The plot, a man arranging his own kidnapping, that goes awry is a good starting point.However from there the execution goes downhill."
2,"It was funny sometimes, but not enough times","I happened to be passing through the channels on cable and came across this movie and saw Anthony and decided to watch. All I can say is Thank Goodness I saw this on cable. It had a few funny scenes like when Anthony was bossy to Jay, but most of the movie didn't make any sense. I mean what are the odds of 3 people thinking of kidnapping somebody on the same night, especially since one of the culprits was himself. Too farfetched and not funny enough to be given more than 2 stars. Sorry Anthony."
2,You'll be held for ransom,if you wactch this annoying mess of a movie. Not even an ok cast can save this movie from its lack of humor. 90 minutes of cliche dumbness.
1,Good sweet lord.,"Not since the birth of Paris Hilton has such an unholy atrocity as this movie been unleashed on the world. Seeing as I don't have enough PTO to list what's wrong with this movie I'll list what's right: absolutely nothing. If someone you know puts this on, gouge your eyes out and smear the blood on the tv screen to prevent others from being subjected to it."
1,You Definetly Need To Skip This At All Costs,"I have never seen this movie and I can tell you for a fact that there's nothing funny about it. When you have to rely on a Bobby Brown joke to make people laugh, you know you're in trouble. I remember seeing the previews of this movie, thinking to myself,""I wouldn't waste my money on that! All the funny scenes were just shown in the preview!"" Then again, the scenes weren't really that hilarious. So take it from someone who hasn't watched this flop of a film: This so-called comedy is not worth the time and money."
5,King's Ransom is a King of Comedy!!!,"throughout this whole film, beginning to end, was comedy!a lot of black comedy films always know how to bring the funny!!!!i highly recommend this movie to anyone who would like to have a good laugh on a friday night!anthony anderson, jay mohr and regina hall were probably the funniest actors in the moviebut overall, everyone was funny and watching the special features adds more to the package!"
4,Tiny pieces made it difficult to put together,This was sent to someone as a gift & the person on the receiving end had difficulties with the tiny pieces but finally got it put together. He seemed to enjoy the project & pleased with the item.
3,"I like Mavado but if you heard one song, you heard them all","Like the title says, Mavado is good but his music is repetitive. As a DJ, I wish there were acapella and instrumental versions to work from. There are only ""dreaming and power cut"" versions. This would be a 5 star if I was able to create my own version."
3,Pretty good material,"Mirror Moves is a fulfilling release from The Psychedelic Furs. Undoubtedly, The Psychedelic Furs is an interesting group. Richard Butler's vocals are unique, and I've never heard another singer that resembles him. There's a total of nine tracks, and I find all of them to be gratifying. Mirror Moves is in a pop rock musical direction. There's also a nice dose of both guitar and keyboard playing throughout. The musicianship, songwriting, and production are good. The disc starts off with the melodious ""The Ghost in You."" My favorite aspect of ""The Ghost in You"" is the attractive keyboard playing. The track that I like the most is the infectious, lively, and danceable ""Heartbeat."" The saxophone playing throughout ""Heartbeat"" is cool. I also consider ""Heartbeat"" to be one of my favorite songs from The Psychedelic Furs. Mirror Moves is a disc that's satisfying from start to finish."
2,Yawn,I remember the Furs being much better than this. Either my memory is shot or their earlier work was much better because this album is weak.
4,So much better than almost all the others by Sinead,"Out of her non-compilation albums (I am not counting here her stunning final live compilation She Who Dwells) this is undeniably the best. It seems that Sinead rises above herself when she sings her country's old folklore and urban ditties. Among my favorites are ""Paddy's Lament"", ""Her Mantle Do Green"", ""Molly Malone"", ""My Lagan Love""... basically there might be just one-two tracks which sound less inspired than the best... but that might be just my unfamiliarity with these songs that prevents me from properly enjoying the entire CD. Also, of course, a lot of these tracks sound more or less alike so you have to be at least a little bit inclined that way in your musical tastes... otherwise you would be bored to eternal sleep.In any case, this is a very very good CD intended mostly for the lovers of folk or pop music. If you are one then get it!"
4,Almost...something special,"This album offers some very goods songs that are worth buying it alone, but it is not the best of her work. I found the vocal echo effects very distracting in some of the songs. I have thoughts of regrets for buying it because of the distraction, as other reviewers have pointed out, the songs are crafted in unique way that they offer something ...almost special."
3,Great Vocals - But Lacks a Universal Appeal,"While I respect Sinead O'Connor for revisiting her Irish heritage with this CD, this effort is not as captivating as ""Faith and Courage."" As usual, Sinead's voice is incredible - when she cranks up the emotion she exibits more depth and soul than any of her Contemporaries. The best example on this CD is ""Molly Malone,"" during which she lets loose with agony and longing. Sinead also sweetly interprets ""The Singing Bird"" and ""The Moorlough Shore"" but all too often the material is one-dimensional."
2,Reverberation,"I mainly bought this CD because I love the song ""Peggy Gordon"", but did she have to sing it so s l o w l y ...? And that echo another reviewer wrote about definitely bothered me, too."
5,Â¡Un gran regreso!,"Â¡Vaya que el tiempo ha esperado mucho!...Despues de su disco del 2000, Sinead Connor vuelve a deleitarnos con su exquisita voz y a demostrarnos posiblemente uno de los mejores discos del aÃ±o."
1,Disappointing,The definition of Sean Nos singing is unaccompanied singing. Why is it that an Irish musician who should know better filled the recording with meaningless synthesized background music while distorting her beautiful voice with vocal processing? I would have liked to hear her voice in its pure form singing the songs unaccompanied or with limited accompaniment.
1,Not good traditional Irish Music,"I was so looking forward to this album because I love traditional Irish music, and I like Sinead's work. In addition, I had seen her do traditional songs (He Moved Through the Fair, among others) live in concert. So I just knew this album was going to be GREAT! What a disappointment, even an appearance by Christy Moore cannot save this sad work. Sinead's arrangements are terrible. Everything has been ""elevatorized"". Instead of wonderful traditional Irish instruments: guitars, banjos, fiddles, penny whistles, pipes, etc. - all the tracks on this album sound as though they're done on a synthesizer. This is one of the worst Irish traditional albums I've ever heard. If you want a real traditional Irish album, buy Paul Brady's ""The Liberty Tapes"" or anything by ""Planxty"". Don't waste your money on this recording like I did."
1,should've gone with the minority vote,"I read quite a number of reviews before I decided to get this and, while not a huge Sinead fan, I am a huge Irish music fan and have been moved to tears by some of the old Irish songs I've heard her sing on other CDs (""Skibbereen"" will rip your heart out & make you want to hit the next Englishman you see!). I must say, I should have gone with the minority vote on this one. What moved me to tears on this was not her voice but the fact that I spent money on this CD at all! It was PAINFULLY overproduced so even songs that might have been able to hold their own sounded.....distorted??!! Anyway, I listened to the whole thing once...will never listen to it again. It is, in fact, on the pile of CDs to go to the used music store, where, hopefully, they will buy it. Maybe someone else will like it (obviously, quite a few Amazon reviewers already did)."
1,what a crushing disappointment,"I thoroughly expected to love this CD. But in fact, it is the most annoying, cloying and aggravating project that I have ever wasted my money on. It is so incredibly self indulgent I can't find words. Almost every track has this grating echo on screeching vocals that are annoying enough without it.The tragedy is that there is so much GREAT music today that starts with traditional Irish and Celtic music and infuses it with a modern esthetic that it is a crime to waste your money on this garbage.If you love new Irsh music and you buy this , you'll feel like a child who gets a rotten apple for Christmas."
2,as gaeilge,Nil aon bhri le teideal an album seo! Ni h-e fiar shean nos ata a canadh ar an album ach amhraniocht chun amhrain a dioladh.

5,My lagan love...,"I've been adoring her sice the 'papa's picture' event.Her voice makes me weep ,crawl.also on this albumespecially on 'Peggy Gordon' and 'My Lagan Love' her voice isdevastating.This rceord is appropriate to see thenaturalness and purity of 'sean nos' and traditional songs."
3,Not of a whole.,"You can't blame Concord for following the recycling and repackaging practices of most other record companies (especially Verve). But the final results are rarely satisfying--disconnected snapshots rather than a cohesive scrapbook. In fact, the variety in the composer's own music is obfuscated rather than brought into focus since the attention is necessarily on the different performers rather than the songs themselves.As for the performances, not one stands out as particularly warm, subtle, or definitive. Gene Harris' ""slow"" treatment of ""A Train"" really doesn't do the tune any favors, none of the featured saxophonists begins to capture the sweetness of Johnny Hodges' sound, the Tito Puente performance makes ""Passion Flower"" recognizable but that's about all. That plus the omission of ""Upper Manhattan Medical Group"" and I'm beginning to question if the bargain price was such a bargain."
4,Good,it is like i expectet from the picture. thank you for the good shirt. i like it so much. wonderful
4,A must have for any Buffalo rock enthusiast !!!!!,This was my all time favorite band growing up in Buffalo. This reunion concert shows they still have it after 14 years. A must have for any Buffalo rock fan who grew up in the 80's
4,Always worth the read...,"Ok, this may not have been as great as some of what I've read of hers, but it was nonetheless enjoyable and worth every minute!"
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting in depth information by arrondissement. Instead, the book offers lists. Many list items have no description. Checking an arrondissement which I've researched intensively, I saw little that isn't in most other guidebooks or websites and found some things missing that in my judgment should have been included."
4,tiltle of what?,"When an author puts a year like 2011 in a book title,in 2012 the book is already out of date.I bought this for a friend who frequently travelsto Paris. she and her husband feel this bookstill contains good information for travelersin spite of the title"
4,good,"I had to cancel the service when I sent the phone back because Amazon would not work with me on getting a replacement phone for the one I was sending back in. I will definitely go back to AT & T, but possibly not through Amazon."
3,Book on Railways of Britain,Good book with plenty of very detailed information prior to 1981.Would have liked a few more maps.Overall a good book for the price since it is no longer published.
2,Don't buy this,"Worked great for the 6 times I used it. After about a year, the battery would not hold a charge and it can't be used plugged in so I don't recommend buying this product."
3,Battery issues,"The product as some very good features. After it was out of warranty, the battery would not hold a charge. Turns out you can buy a new battery from the Campbell website for about the discounted cost of a new unit at Amazon. I researched the battery and found that the UB1250 battery sold on Amazon for about $15 is plug compatible. the unit is easy to open (7 screws) and the battery has plug on terminals. My unit now runs like new. This unit does not have a low voltage cutoff which is probably why my battery did not last very long. The battery is a form of lead acid. Do not run it completely down till the compressor does not work. This will damage the battery."
2,Not as Advertised,"My wife was very disappointed with this purchase, because the title ""It Happened on 5th Avenue"" is advertised as Color, even on the case, but the dvd is actually in Black & White. The return policy requires that the item be in its original plastic wrap, but by the time my wife discovered the movie to not be as advertised, she had already opened three of the cases. I guess we're stuck with someone's mistake, but we won't make this mistake again on Amazon. This is the first time we have been disappointed with an Amazon purchase."
3,Good workbook,"A nice book, but something about it made me not really wanting to read it and I love reading.Not sure what it was, it is okay, depends on the person. Parent probably would not enjoy it, a person in the practice would."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING BOOK! Not worth the read or price,"I was looking for a book that would help give me more insight into my 6 year old Autistic sons behavior and after reading the 'rave reviews' picked this one. What a disappointment this book turned out to be! This book was without any doubt written for the parents that have little or next to nothing to do with their child's therapy. I am by no means an expert on Autistic behavior, but I can say that if you are truly a hands on, use common sense type of parent - this book is NOT for you! For example, in one section of the book it clearly states that you do not reward bad behavior - isn't that something we should already know? It also says that you should not give in to tantrums - once again, something else you should already know if you have a working brain! This is not a book I would ever recommend to anyone who has practical intelligence."
5,ATT: ABA teachers for children with autism,This is a great book to get a solid foundation of ABA methodology and it's application to children with autism. A must for every teacher!!
3,Dandelion,"The book is full of wonderful, useful information. I like the fact that it has recipes-but $30 some odd dollars for this little book??? Come on!!! I am keeping the book but unless someone wants to spend that much money on such a little book I would suggest looking in used book stores or just about anywhere else to find it cheaper."
4,The most complete guide to eating the wonderful dandelion,"This is a great little book, packed with interesting information and lots of great recipes for eating the root, leaves, and flowers of dandelions. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in foraging. Dandelions are the perfect first foraging food, and reading this book will ensure you harvest and prepare it correctly for the best flavor. But you may want to poke around the Internet for a copy. $35 is not the going rate :)"
2,A Rhythmic Jumble,"Sophie Yates is a fine technician, and this is an admirable program. But it annoys the hell out of me, because it constantly falls out of rhythmic focus, becoming a jumble of notes instead of the invigorating musical experience it could have been. The primary melodic lines are often drowned out by the guitar-strumming backgrounds, which lose their impetus as a result. The tricky caesuras, particularly in the Soler Fandango, are just plain botched.My absolute favorite Soler Fandango is a mind-blowing traversal by Jonathan Woods, but the touchstone in this repertory is the work of the late Fernando Valenti, whose immersion in the electrifying spirit of Scarlatti in Iberia sent sparks up my spine. Here, there are a few stretches where one hears the music with clarity -- until it all falls apart."
1,Not Impressed!,"I bought this item for my deployment to Iraq. While the bag looks big, it's not. I expected this though and knew the real size before I ordered it. That was not the problem, the bag it'self was. With in the first week of using the bag the zipper got stuck and in the process of getting the zipper unstuck the bag ripped at the seams. The regular material is of good quality but the seams and zippers are not. It would also be better if the bag could literally lock into the rail system and the zipper have a big enough hole to put a luggage lock on it. I am not very happy with this purchase at all."
5,Good product at stellar price!,I now have one of these for both my Bikes. This is a great product reduced to Fair price at last!
3,"BULK, BULK, BULK",The only problem I have with this unit is the needless bulk of the bag. It's almost like an insulated bag that is made for keeping things cold or hot and it makes the bag heavier and harder to work with.I liked the mounting system for this bag and this is the only reason I still have it. Slide on and lock in place. Easily removed with the push of a button. It is plenty roomy with the side panniers but for me a little too much. I now have a hard side case with the mounting system from this bag and I like it much better.
2,Too incomplete,"Lorenz Hart and his musical collaborator, Richard Rodgers, met in college. For the next quarter-century, these two would produce some remarkable music. Hart's brilliant lyrics perfectly matched Rodgers' melodies. Hart struggled all his life with both the stigma of homosexuality (things were unfortunately different in the 1930s) and alcoholism. Drinking may have contributed to Hart's premature death at age 48, in 1943.The RODGERS & HART songbook has some fine examples, yet too much of this duo's best work is not here: ""Blue Moon,"" ""My Heart Stood Still,"" ""Bewitched, Bothered And Bewildered,"" ""Mimi,"" ""The Most Beautiful Girl In The World,"" ""Ten Cents A Dance,"" ""My Funny Valentine,"" ""In The Cool Of The Evening,"" ""The Lady Is A Tramp"" and ""Where Or When"" are all worthy of inclusion. In fact, several of these should have been favored over songs that ARE on this album.There's better Rodgers & Hart collections available. (2 stars)"
5,A classic of American progressive rock,"This is a great collection of previously unreleased material from the early part of The Muffins original existence (they formed in the early 70's, broke up in the early 80's, then reformed again about 5 years ago). As mentioned in the previous review, all the material predates their first album, and in fact, predates drummer Paul Sears recruitment into the circus. If you like stuff like Hatfield And The North, National Health, and Caravan, you should definitely give this (and the rest of the Muffins catalog) a listen.BTW, this album is technically out of print (and very likely will never be reprintd), so if you're THINKING of buying it, I say do it NOW. :-)"
2,Not what I pictured for my young daughter.,"Sorry, I like Bill Bennett and all, but I really didn't see how a young person today could relate to these stories. The very first story I ad-libbed as I read it to my daughter. I could not see making Ganges Khan out as a hero so I just called him a King. From there I thought it all went pretty much down hill. Someone might want to take some of these and modernize them before they use them. That's my 2 cents worth."
5,A must have,Sometimes you just don't know where to go to get the quality information you need to give to your children. Schools don't use this material any more. Divided into categories which makes it even better. Using for an evening devotional for my granddaughter and to help er read out loud to improve enunciation.
2,Cheap Table- Not as pictured,"The picture leads you to believe that it folds once. It doesn't. Additionally, the bag looks nothing like the picture which would give you the idea that you think you are buying a table that only folds in half (the more folds, the cheaper and more painful to set up). The material is nice, cheap chip and cup holders. I would not recommend buying this."
4,Bought item as bday gift,"I bought this as a bday gift for my bf. This table folds up nicely into the bag and is easy to store - not as heavy as I thought it would be. Nice cup holders and chip holders - maybe could be a little deeper. Cards don't slide very easily across the surface, so dealer needs to be a bit more accurate about card placement, especially with all 8 players seated. I would recommend this to anyone who plays poker on a semi-regular basis."
2,review of portable poker table top,"Because it folds up into quarters which is nice for carrying and storage, it puts too many ridges and seams in the top surface and it is hard to clear the cards or chips off of the felt surface of the table top. I am going to try to return it and get a top that folds in half and has only one smooth seam. I have used this type in the past and will continue to use this type."
3,Texas Holdem,"Not as good as original issue from Wal-Mart, but does the job. Has provided fun on poker night with friends."
2,very well order,"It's a very well narrated book. It's neat. But majority of facts are irrelevant. Firstly, she tells about the life of his father, and them, she tells about the life of his husband. It's very superficial."
3,Entertaining,"Definitely a book to curl up with while on holiday, Satan Bug is a typical, fast-paced McLean thriller. The plot revolves around the theft of chemical-weapon grade virus-samples (described in suitably horrifying detail) from a top secret British laboratory and the efforts of spooks from various government departments, led by Pierre Cavell, to recover the samples. As in most of the McLean works, the research has been impeccable and one does get a crash course on terrifying viruses and their potential effects during a conflict-situation. While focussing on the doomsday scenario for most part of the book, McLean introduces a great twist in the end... in all, a perfect page-turner."
5,Best read in quite a while,"This book was written in 1962, but it comes thru the 48 years of techno changes with flying colors. I've read a few others of his - mostly thought they were mediocre to medium - turns out like a lot of other authors, their earlier works are their best. Guns of Navarone was #2, this is #9."
4,A Book to Inspire Us,"The book serves as a wonderful testimony of the giftedness of today's generation. In this book, you will discover the creative abilities of tomorrow's leaders. Use this book as an opportunity to inspire your kids, students, and future writers."
2,Not Great,"This compilation, recorded in 1983 at the now-defunct LSI studio in Nashville, was the product of Earle's record deal with CBS. ""The Devil's Right Hand"" and ""A Little Bit In Love"" show writing promise, and Earle's impressive, gritty Texas guitar and sparse rockabilly instrumental arrangements (particlarly ""Nothin But You"") make this piece appealing for Earle die-hards and collectors, but was deemed unfit for country radio and the finished project here was unceremoniously shelved. (Ironically, ""A Little Bit In Love"" would later surface on Patty Loveless' second MCA CD.) For the most part, however, Earle's singing is not up to par and the few rays of light contained here did not prepare the listener (or Nashville's music heirarchy) for the monolith that was to come."
2,Early Tracks [EXTRA TRACKS] Specially This CD Was Skipped,"I See Track 4, 11, and 10 They Were All Skipped At The Whole Time"
1,Why is this still listed?,I ordered this for my son's birthday. Nothing happened on the order. I emailed Pierce This 2. They emailed back saying they were working on the order. After a few more days they unceremoniously cancelled the order -- thanks for nothing!
5,Trudy's Time and PLace,"Once again Edmark keeps our kids happy with another outstanding product. I've seen kids from 3+ to 7 play this. Several different activities with both Q/A mode or explore mode keeps kids with varied levels of skills busy, entertained and learning. The games ""grow"" with the kids. Both educational and loads of fun, it's a must for all homes.We have enjoyed it so much, we continue to buy it for gifts."
3,Much Too Complex for 3 year olds,"Although my daughter asks to play with this a lot (cute characters) she gets frustrated immediately with the navigation. Perhaps I'll hold on to it until she is 4+, but the material is too mature for her at 3 & 1/2."
4,Waiting for new edition from the same author!,"I purchased this book in Singapore years ago with the purpose of understanding the new development of Visual Basic 4.0 and getting the Certificate from the University of Phoenix.I was surprised by the good organization of the book. The author is not teaching you but is directing you how to use Visual Basic better. This is excellent for beginner and people with some basic knowledge in Visual Basic. You will find it useful!The other good thing is that no matter where you are in the world, you could earn the Certificate. This is exactly somekind of distance learning with good quality.The only things I was dissatisfied is that you could not earn Three Advanced Placement Credit as printed on the cover and you will only receive a transcript of your study.Anyway, I really hope that there would be a new book on Visual Basic 6.0 written by the same author with more lesson on Database, Multimedia, Windows API and Internet programming."
3,I'm sorry to say this . . . .,"I was not overly impressed with this book. It seemed a little disorganized. There were things you learn in lesson 17 that could have been taught earlier giving new comers and faster sense of accomplishment. The book was easy to follow for the most part though. I must admit, I gave up on it at lesson 18. I switched to Visual Basic NightSchool for version 5."
5,Verdi for everyone,"I love this series (besides Verdi, it has Wagner, Mozart, Haydn, etc.) Being able to hear the music as you read about it makes a huge difference, and the text is written in an accessible way. It breaks the stereotype of Classical music being staid and boring."
1,Zero stars if I could - horrible quality.,"""Lovely walnut finish?"" don't make me laugh. I ordered these and couldn't get them back to Target fast enough for a full refund. The finish was dull, uneven, nothing like the photo. Target picked them up next day and gave a full refund, including the shipping cost."
3,almost what I expected,"For the price, they're not bad. I didn't have a problem with dings or nicks, the finish is fine (not amazing). But again, if I'd wanted amazing quality, I'd have gotten a $200 set. However, the rack, once assembled, is a bit off-center, and obviously wasn't test-assembled or quality checked.The stands themselves seem sturdy and level. Very serviceable."
1,T'aint Walnut,"I was disappointed. The ad says ""Walnut"" and the picture shows a wood grain. When delivered I noticed the box said ""walnut finish"" and it looks like particle board painted dark brown, no grain to it. The construction is also poor, I've had to rescrew and glue two of the four tables since I got them a month ago."
4,Good Combo For The Price,This is a good combo kit for the price. Exterior finish is not as nice as a Schlage but the mechanics and quality of the lock is very good. Works very smooth.
4,in my country,heartfelt especially for the accounts of SA history. sam jackson really sexy in this film
1,Horrible,"Samuel Jackson, Juliette Binoche...I thought it's gonna be a wonderful movie. To my greatest disappointment this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life.A married mother with three children has an affair with a journalist and yet she's the one to fight for someone rights or to be compassionate about someone. What a non-sense!Hope the greedy amateurs who created this movie WON some moneywith this crap movie by LOSING their chance to ever film again!Never ever I will watch a movie with Samuel L. Jackson or Juliette Binoche, again. I'm surprised how did they agree to star in this kind of ""movie"" that wastes your precious time."
2,Train Wreck of a Movie,"""In My Country"" is undermined straight from the start by its tone deaf casting. This film - based on the narrative writings of stellar South African journalist Antjie Krog - somehow gets a starring duo of a Frenchwoman and Irishman playing Afrikaaners and an American (Samuel L. Jackson) ludicrousy grafted on top of the screenplay for the sake of starpower and a wacky, contrived melodrama that never existed in Krog's tale. This is most unfortunate because Krog's stories - her take on South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission - is one that should be heard far and wide. Unfortunately, the filmmakers bury that behind this odd and inexplicable need to feature a quasi-adulterous liaison between Binoche and Jackson's characters.How did it turn out? Take a look at the DVD extras: Samuel L. Jackson is nowhere to be found. This is a man who knows quality and knows junk. He must taken a look at the final product and ran from this thing as fast as he could.Good move. Smart guy."
2,I can't get over the lousy lyrics...,"The guys in Spock's Beard are highly talented musicians, but their song writing is weak at times. The lyrics on this album are some of the worst I've ever heard - ""My name is Senor Velasco, I drink my milk with tabasco"". What! Before buying this album I bought Kindness of Strangers and Beware of Darkness, two albums I was impressed with, but this CD disappointed me. If you've never heard Spock's Beard before and you want to get into them, I recommend Beware of Darkness. Also, if you don't care about lyrics then you'd probably like this album because it is superb instrumentally."
4,THIS IS THE NOW OF PROG -- OLD PROGGIES NEED TO LIGHTEN UP!,"First of all, there are way too many of you comparing these guys to the heavies of the proggy 70's. Sure, there's the obvious inspirations, but these guys have their own sound. As for the lyrics, geez, remember when stringing words together could be...fun? The reviewers complaning about ""Senor Velasco"" should take a cold hard look at the nonsense of ""Willow Farm""The Light is a great debut... and things only get better on their next effort ""Beware of Darkness"""
4,A revelation,"I'm a Yes fan (first heard them in 1970!) - and I first heard of Spock's Beard through 'also bought' links at Amazon, tried some samples... and was hooked. I bought 'The Light' first (and have subsequently bought all the rest!) and enjoy it the most. Spock's Beard are MUSICIANS. 'The Light' has everything - creativity, well-written songs, classy instrumentalism ... a very enjoyable introduction to this band. I am now a fan, and their CD's join my Yes, (old!) Genesis, Camel, Alan Parsons, Pink Floyd ..."
5,Their finest moment,"Just when I thought that prog rock was dead, along comes Spock's Beard with this awesome, at times off the wall, CD. Being in my 40's, I grew up with the great prog rock giants of the 70's (ELP, Yes, Genesis, etc...), and have only been mildly amused at the bands since then that have incorporated prog-rock 'musings' into their sound. It is great to hear a respectful nod to the past, with an infusion of pop to make what some consider a dead art into a living and breathing thing again.Thanks, Neil, for keeping the dream alive and not skating into oblivion with the 'flavor of the day' when it comes to 'todays music'. SB stuck to their guns, and made a classic prog rock CD that will have this diehard fan pulling it out on a regular basis."
4,A worthy effort,"The Light constituted my introduction to Spock's Beard. It's good enough that I want to hear more, but not so good that I don't want to hear more... you know what I mean?The title track is spunky, eclectic, and, yes, long. ""Go the Way You Go"" and ""On the Edge"" are smaller-scale: less structurally complex and more immediately palatable. However, ""The Water"" crosses some line with me -- a line dividing ""interesting"" from ""obnoxious"", so I tend to skip this track.The frequent comparisons to Echolyn should be qualified; they don't sound like Echolyn, but I can see some similarities in their brand of ""progressiveness"".A good listen. I look forward to their later albums."
3,"Ballerina vocals, Orchestral Undertones","So, you get a bunch of guys together with a load of talent and let them do their own thing. The vocals are the ballerinas. The music is the orchestra. If you saw a homeless person dancing on the street, you wouldn't know the coreography going on in his mind. If you closed your eyes and listened to the sounds in Central Park, you wouldn't make sense of the pigeons and the taxis. However, together, for those of us that can appreciate the contemplative expressionist, the two pieces work together to form an expression of angst against a world that moves too fast to contemplate. I keep this as a token of the unformed digression of emotions that I feel from day to day. It is not a hopeful preview of that which can be in each of us. It is the slippery grasp of what we just missed. These guys have done better. So can we."
1,DISGRACEFUL CURSING!,"Sorry Beard fans, but the obscene-filled track ""Water"" is a total disgrace. I am a big fan of Spock's Beard and have all of their studio albums except this one. A friend of mine bought it and played me the above mentioned track. Like I said, that song is a total disgrace and I am glad to see that they have not sunk to that level since. There is no sense in yelling F You over and over! They must have been listening to Guns N'Roses that day or watching ""Scarface"". If you want a Spock's Beard cd, buy ""Beware Of Darkness"" or the new one ""V"". Ignore this trash!"
1,NO NEED TO USE DIRTY LINGO....,"TO REVIEWER A MUSIC FAN,YOUR LACK OF INTELEGENCE & LACK OF VOCABULARY REALLY SHOWS ME YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT GOOD MUSIC.PEOPLE OR BANDS FOR THAT MATTER DON'T NEED FOUL LINGO TO PUT OUT GOOD MUSIC.I LIKE SB ALSO BUT WILL NOT PUT UP WITH LACK OF EXPRESSION THROUGH FOUL LINGO,ONLY 1 OTHER CD THAT I KNOW OF HAS ONE 4 LETTER WORD IN IT.WHAT A WASTE OF GOOD MUSIC.if i have offended anyone....GET OVER IT....LETS CLEAN AMERICAN!!!!!!!!!!!PS:I LOVE SPOCKS BEARD.."
2,Design Guide ?,"As the title say is a Blow molding ""design guide"". As a processor in the blow molding bussiness I bought it trying to find design guides to help me in the manufacture of the tools ( dies , necks,blow pins ,etc ) to produce bottles. Instead I found a summary of the elementary concepts of blow molding."
4,Perfect sunny day driving music,"The Shout Out Louds are just fantastic. I saw them live at Coachella last month and they were utterly charming and disarming. The album is a good representation of their live sound with nary a poor song. With the right promotion and support, this could be one of THE albums of the summer.Way to go, Sweden--first ABBA now this. Perfect pop all around."
4,Good times,"I must admit, at first I didn't like this CD. But after listening to it several times, it grew on me. It was certainly not anything I had ever listened to and it opened up new doors to different music and must say I'm glad I bought this CD. :D"
2,Another drop in the bucket,"I saw this on a ""best of 2005"" list and I have to say I am disappointed. The musicality of this record is not too bad. It's not terribly creative, but it is enjoyable. What really turned me off was the incredibly vapid and thoughtless lyrics. Unfortunately this is just another pop record, of which there are way too many these days. The only track on here that I would give a second listen too is seagull. I wouldn't recommend the rest of the album."
1,YAWN!!!,"A catchy poppy CD completely void of originality... It's like they thought 'Let's just cut and paste this crap together from the CD's we like, no one will notice.'Seriously, there's nothing these guys do that we haven't already heard far too many times."
2,Boring!,The first song is okay... the rest are incredible boring. This album is completely unoriginal. I regret buying it.
3,Weathertech Front Floor Mats,Ordered black & seems like the color scuffed off of them the very 1st time & it's not even winter yet!They fit nicely -- driver's side better so than the passenger side.
1,"""Hardcore"" for the retarded","I found this on clearance for $1.50 and bought it just to see how bad it was. It lived up to my expectations and then some. Any hardcore mystique they might of had is completely blown here. An absolute joke of a band making ""angry"" music for happy white kids. The epitome of fake hardcore."
4,Rare Find,"This disk is a rare find. Basically rock, with bluesy/ folksy undertones, this disk shines all the way through. I found myself repeatedly listening to songs such as ""Penelope Tree"" and ""The Refuge Tree."" The band sports a variety of musical sounds, ranging from Prince to Led Zeppelin, all within the song ""Halfway Around the World."" Strong guitar playing, accompanied by sensational lyrics (listen to ""I Decided to Fly"") are the cornerstone of this album of four friends who flew to Australia to quickly record this album. Perhaps because it lacks studio fine-tuning, it is upbeat, sad, spontaneous, and jamming all at once."
3,"A New, Youthful Take on SF","In this book, Wellington has combined myriad aspects of the SF genre, from rousing space battles to intrigue, to the nature of identity, both universal and personal. Intermingled are ideas of feminism, heritage, and the place of technology. This book represents the first major effort by a young writer finding his narrative voice and solidifying his own ideologies. Not to mention that it's just a fun book to read."
3,next pressing should have better quality control,"The story itself was told well. I was surprised they glossed over the Apollo 1 disaster and how it delayed the program, but it was otherwise ok.The video could have been cleaned up, but I wasn't expecting much at this price. They could stand to do some video processing, though. There's a lot of dirt on the films that could be digitally removed.However, I have a serious beef with the DVD. I tried watching it on three different devices with different sound systems, and on each of them (so I know it wasn't my sound setup) there was terrible reverb on the sound track for the chapter ""The Time of Apollo"". It was terribly annoying, but thankfully it ended once the ""Apollo 4"" chapter started. DVDs should NOT ship with such a defect! I basically can't watch that chapter because the reverb drives me batty. It's like the old Stan Freberg skit where Elvis can't turn off his reverb machine, except it's 27 minutes long... AAAARGH!!!"
4,OK for the I spy beginner....,Good starter I spy book for the younger spier in your house. I would say 3 or 4 would be the oldest.
2,Tiny Book,"The book is okay - better for a 3-year old than a 5-year old, but it is TINY! I'll remember to look at the book measurements next time..."
2,I didn't read the listing close enough,It's my fault for not checking the listing close enough. I thought this was a board book like the other I Spy we have. This is a paperback and hasn't survived the wear and tear that my son has given.
3,More of a toddler level than a preschool level,"These books have great pictures and I love the concept. Just a word of warning that even though it says it is a preschool level, they are VERY easy. My three year old does not find them a challenge at all. I would classify these as more of a toddler level book."
4,Very happy to have this on hand,"A great gadget - didn't know such solidly made snow pushers were still made until a friend recommended this brand. Got one of each handle style, and glad to have both.Way too heavy to use a lifting shovel, so need to keep one of those nearby. This weight really makes scraping packed snow and ice easy. The big width not only limits slide-off to the sides, but also makes a smoother ""ride"" over rough surfaces.One complaint: the rear doesn't curve in quite enough. Unlike a snowplow, even moderate amounts of snow just roll over the top. Still extremely useful, though, and highly recommended."
4,Works as advertised,"It is a docking station so you only care if docks your computer without headaches, and it does. I did need to purchase a dual PS/2 to USB adapter to connect my older keyboard and mouse to the dock as it just supports USB."
4,A Fun Read with Lots Going On,"Originally published in the UK as ""Dancing with Mules"", ""Wild Cats and Colleens"" is a fun read with a rich and varied cast of characters and a very comical plot line. Xavier Big is an absurdly rich and totally out-of-touch with reality American whose devotion to his dead Irish mammy borders on the psychotic. When he decides (and publicly announces) that he must marry a good Irish girl that mother would be proud of, you can imagine what chaos ensues in every county of Ireland. Married or unmarried, every red-haired Irish lassie thinks she stands a chance. There are lots of well-written characters in this book, some of whom you will like and some of whom will make you grind your teeth! But its a fun read and I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it."
1,Not as pictured,"I ordered this comforter set but got a different pattern instead and the color looked more yellow than gold. Also, I ordered a King size but got a Queen set instead eventhough the plastic bag it came in said King. I also ordered two set of sheets from Joseph Abboud but got JC Penny brand in Joseph Abboud's bags. Not sure who is packing these stuff for them..."
3,Everything sticks to these,"Not suprisingly these should not be worn outside. Dust, pet hair, lint sticks to these things like crazy. Fun novelty item though."
3,A fun product,"These are a very fun product. They seem to stay on okay as long as you're walking in a leisurely fashion :^). I wore them to work today and they stayed on fairly well most of the day but by the end were starting to lose their sticky, causing me to walk as though I had a limp to keep them on. However, the instructions do say quite emphatically that feet MUST be clean and dry, and this kind of shoe does not lend itself to keeping your feet either clean or dry, so I can understand why those of us who choose to try walking around in them all day might end up with problems keeping them on. I would say keep them as more of a novelty for parties and times when you won't be walking around as much, than for wearing to work or to college. :^)"
2,Don't stay on,"They stayed on for a few minutes around the house, so I wore them to go to the store. I didn't even get across the parking lot before they started coming loose, and then they came completely off walking in the store. After reapplying, it happened again. As per instructions they were clean and dry all the time."
1,Too much cleaning required.,Got the sandals today and am already disappointed. The instructions say you should clean them by washing and brushing after 2 wearings. Who wants to clean their shoes that often. It seems that they might be useful for catching large rats though.
1,Don't Stick or Stay,What a great idea for sandals that stay on your feet without plastic straps. I was so excited to try these out for a beach vacation. I was so excited that I bought 2 pair. They came in the mail and I followed all directions. But they would even stay on as I walked around the house. I gave the other pair to my sister. She had the same trouble!!! She went to class and ended up on the campus bus barefoot because the stupid things wouldn't stay.
3,Beautiful cup but no saucer,"This is undoubtedly a beautiful tea cup but I was misled by the photo. Of course I expected to receive a saucer as well, but in fact as the title suggests you get a tea cup and nothing more. You have to go to the original website, mytableware.com and order the saucer -- or just omit ordering through Amazon and order both directly from the source. I was a bit miffed, I admit, and for that reason I give this transaction a mere 3 stars, otherwise I would have given it five."
5,Great blade!,These are awesome blades! They cut better than any other blade we have used. It cuts on the pull. A sharp blade that makes straight cuts a breeze!
4,Understanding drilling for oil,"I found this book to be very informative, even for a non-oilfield person like myself. I have a good understanding of what it takes to find & produce oil & natural gas."
1,"DOA, Unreliable and Useless","I ordered two of these for an important project. One stopped working after making a single call, requiring a replacement.My problems didn't end there. Despite getting a replacement, neither of these modems worked reliably. Calls failed to connect half the time, and even when it did connect, it was extremely slow and prone to disconnects. After some testing, trying different drivers and configurations, using them in different computers, and trying other products, we determined the modems themselves were faulty. Using another model from a different company solved all these problems.Three faulty modems. Hours of labor troubleshooting. Just stay away from this product."
1,USRobotic Faxmodem USR5670,Didn't work at all with my computer. Drivers sent w/modem were old versions. Downloaded Vista software from USRobotics also doesn't work. Tech from USRobotic was helpful but even he said that there was no way to make it work. Sent modem back. I rated it one star but would have given it five IF it had worked.
1,Not working after one week.,"This modem after one week is holding the phone line ""off hook"". As soon as you plug in the phone line it is off the hook and cannot function at all. Tried hard reboot, driver reinstall, and uninstall reinstall. This appears to be a physical switch problem in the modem. I have just sent tech support an email and will update this review. For now I cannot recommend this product. FYI - Was working fine with VentaFax for one week."
2,Does not support CallerID,"I installed this in Windows 2003 server as a fax modem, and according to USR it's supported, but they don't mention that the 5670 does NOT support caller-ID.They will mention ""call notification"", which is a proprietary CallerID-like application that does a screenpop, and doesn't support any OS after XP.They recommend the 5610c, which is $50 more, JUST for CallerID.It works OK as a cheap fax-modem, but you're reliant on TSID (which is programmed on the transmitting fax machine)."
4,U S Robotic USR 5670,I works fine except I haven't been able to get the caller ID to work with it. The caller ID software only works if you are online. I don't know why they don't include software for Caller ID that works even if you are offline.
1,Internet call notification does not work,I have tried this modem in two different PCs and the internet call notification does not work. I have called technical support (1-888-428-9450) and they are absolutely no help. Now I am stuck with a useless modem.
3,USRobotics Intenal PCI Modem,"USRobotics is the leader in high quality modems. However, I ended up not using this product and resold it."
3,Big Ox Little Ox,"I got this for my daughter's stocking stuffer... she wanted a ""baby"" for her big green ox & loved it... for about two weeks she played with it a lot & then it got stuffed in with the rest of the plush toys. BUT, whenever she puts her big green ox to bed...she has to go find the little pink baby ox for him to sleep with. So, it is a great toy and really cute, but like all stuffed animals... it is going to be shelf bound for patches throughout the year."
5,The Last Open Road,"Good book, very interesting. If you love cars this is a book for you. The characters are at times funny and have great depth. Good racing scenes. I want the Jag with the carburator problems."
4,Great historical fiction,"Levy has a knack for placing the reader back in 1952 to experience the people, cultural clashes, and the cars without apology for the realities of the time. The characters are well developed with a realistic feel to their passions and faults. He obviously knows his cars and the plot takes the characters through actual race venues with a minimum of poetic license towards the results. After reading ""The Last Open Road"" I put the next book (""Montezuma's Ferrari"") at the top of my birthday wish list."
2,Recipes just ok,"I was disappointed with this cookbook. At best, the recipes turn out ok. I do not use this cookbook much."
3,"It's OK, yet it leaves you with nothing you already knew","It's a fine book for people who've never even blogged before. But it's not for seasoned bloggers who want to make money of their writing talents, or to help their businesses with blogging. I recommend Scoble's ""Naked Conversations"", it's more insightful and inspirational."
4,Business Owner (Mutualwin.net),"This is a pretty good book. I definetly got some tips that I am going to be implementing into my business (www.mutualwin.net). When you have a small advertising budget, blogging definetly helps generate some new exposure and Blog Marketing helped out. Michael Bernstein"
5,Best Ever,"I have read just about every NASCAR book written and this is the best yet! Great insight into the early days at Daytona. It's easy to tell when the author knows his subject, and Ed Hinton does. HIGHLY RECOMMEDED!!!"
5,A Synopsis of Nascar,"This book is really an easy read. I read it in one afternoon. I found the story on Darrell Waltrip's concussion injury and the comments from Junior Johnson very surprising. There is another chapter on a driver who never made a name, but suffered a head injury which resulted in his elderly parents caring for him. The final chapter on Dale Earnhardt definitely could have been written by any fan who watched the race on that tragic day."
3,Great book for NASCAR trivia,"The author writes some of the most interesting stories about the birth of NASCAR and how Daytona played into the development of the sport. This was one of those books you hate to put down until you get to the last three chapters and all of a sudden it becomes filled with boring and ""who cares"" opinions and ""facts."" If you are a true NASCAR fan you'll find the book very interesting and a fun read. But, if you're an Earnhardt fan you'll be sorely disappointed, considering the title. You can skip the last three chapters, nothing new or interesting."
2,Well-written but self-serving,"Ed Hinton...used t be a ""friend"" of Earnhardt's until he stabbed the Intimidator in the back in an SI article in 1995. Thereafter, Earnhardt would not even speak Hinton's name. so, is it any surprise that DE doesn't come off so well in this book? For every grudging admiring reference, there is outright glee when Jeff Gordon bests the aging racer and usurps his throne. Yes, Wonderboy comes out best in this tome â proclaimed the best race-car driver (in any format) who has ever lived. This book is fascinating and well-written, but it is not perfect and is marred by Hinton's animosity toward Earnhardt..."
5,Funny and poignant,"Great story filled with unique characters. Women seem to keep falling in Posy's lap after she tries to come out to her family. But her coming out is interpreted as an April Fool's Day joke. I loved the unfinished business with Ginny. Great twist, though it is hard to understand how she forgot about what happened. This book takes you for a fun ride filled with well defined personalities. Too bad I couldn't find more by this author. Guess I am one of those greedy fans."
3,shame about the bad translation,"As most people that wrote a review about this book, I read it (many times) in Dutch a long time ago.The book itself is absolutely brilliant, but I was quite shocked by the useless translation.It must be very hard to read for people that don't speak Dutch, because of a lot of direct translations.I am aware that this translation is out of print and hopefully, with the (English spoken) film coming up end of this year, it will be followed up with a proper English translation.Then the whole world should read it - and all the rest of Thea Beckman's books!"
3,Better Translation,"I was assigned this book to read in a Dutch class and absolutely fell in love with it. When I borrowed and English version from the library, I found that a lot of the humor and warmth was lost in translation. I wish that the translator had used more colloquial English and relied less on word-for-word. Still, as really very few people speak Dutch, I have to reccomend the English version as it is still a fantastic time travel adventure."
2,It's Driving Me Crazy,"A re-issue of songs mostly from Rick's 70's cartoon series ""Mission Magic"" (see the four-star-average reviews for the album ""Backtracks""). If you like very sugar-coated fluff songs (think rainbows, clouds and puppy dogs), you will love this. If you like Rick's guitar riffs and lyrics about adult life, this is not for you. I am a huge Rick Springfield fan, but for me, this is a drink coaster... so if you are curious to see what Rick sounds like singing cutsey Partidge Family-type songs, go for it. I'll stick to Rick's heavier and more serious stuff like how you talk to girls (trust me, that song actually has more serious lyrics than this!)."
3,Mostly a re issue of songs from Mission Magic,"I really think that the record company could have come up with a better way to put ""Speak to the Sky"" out there for us to hear. Instead we get another re issue from Mission Magic.. ""You can't judge a Book"", and ""We're Gonna Have A Good Time"". If you wanted to see Speak to the Sky re released.. It would have made a nice bonus track for Comic Book Heroes... Now that was a great Album... Sorry Rick I own most of these songs..."
3,Not able to support higher amperage tools ...,The built in circuit breaker trips when I use my electric blower.Functions well as a light and retracts well.
3,Doesn't Fully Retract,"The light works and the extension plug works, but the cord will not fully retract back inside the spool. It slowly stops at about 3 ft. or so. It's kind of annoying because it hangs where I need to walk between the cars, but luckily I have hook near by where I can hang the light out of the way."
1,Poor product,Odered one of these and when it got to me the cage that protects the bulb was broken. Amazon replaced it quickly. The second one had screws rolling around inside it and had a terrible gringing when I tried to pull the cord out. Returned it and will spend the money to get a Baycor? Bayco? whitch ever it is.
3,It's Long!,"While I disagree with the conclusions reached in the book, I appreciate a consistent and thorough reporting on the young-earth creationist viewpoint. My main disagreement comes with the repeated conclusion that there must have been accelerated nuclear decay at some point in the past. I would like to point out the interesting contradiction here with another branch of Christian science: the Intelligent Design movement. One of the strongest arguments for ID is known as ""fine tuning,"" which states that if the physical constants were different from what they are, life on earth would be drastically affected. In order to achieve accelerated decay, young-earthers assert that there must have been a weakening in the strong nuclear force, along with others (see Chaffin, p. 305). If it's a choice between fine tuning and accelerated decay, I choose fine tuning.I don't know if they want me to say this, but poke around online. I found this book in a .pdf, all 676 pages of it."
5,A fabulous read,"I was not familiar with the Brothers Grim fairy tale before reading this book; but the story is fabulous even without knowing the story. The characters are very real and engaging. And while the story follows the usual fairy tale formula, Hale tweaks it slightly to show Ani's growth from silence and inaction to empowerment. Hale's use of language and imagery is very beautiful. I especially like one description of ""words hanging like a dying moth"". This novel reminds me quite a bit of Robin McKinley's _Beauty_ and _The Blue Sword_. I look forward to reading many more books by Ms. Hale. I highly recommend this book for teens or adults (like me) who love Young Adult Fiction."
2,A different point of view,"I have to disagree with a great many people about how ""great"" this book is.Have you ever wandered through your attic and found your old children books? And smiled as reading them, and instantly remembered the joy they gave you as a kid, and STILL give you that same little kid joy.Yup, this is NOT it.Total disappointment. Okay I get it, it's a reconstruction of the fairy tales, got it then, get it now...but REALLY? Where is some original work here? Where's a deeper story, or maybe a different angle? UTTER disappointment. Let's be creative here!!"
4,Princess for hire: can save herself,"Having just readPrincess Academy, I went on to this and liked it even better. Goose Girl gave me chills as I read - I could practically smell the city stink and hear the honking of the geese. While one particular plot twist was obvious to the adult reader, it would be a pleasant surprise to the younger one. Nothing like a princess who saves herself!"
4,Good Teen Lit.,"I thought this book was a bit simplistic in style, but it was still an enjoyable read. I wish it had been a bit more atmospheric. Between the updated, modern attitudes of the characters and the sparse descriptions, the book seemed much more modern that its intended setting. I liked it, but I felt like with a bit more effort, it could have been fantastic instead of just good."
5,The Goose Girl,"We listened to this book on CD as a family. It took us by total surprise!!! It has now become one of our very favorite books. It created a story that was so beautiful, we wanted it to continue forever. Glad to find out it's a series."
5,Fairy Tale Retold,"The Goose Girl is the story of Ani, Crown Princess of Kildenree. Ani is betrothed to the Crown Prince of Bayern, which is a month's journey away. On the way to Bayern, some things happen that will change Ani's life forever. I don't want to go into more detail for fear of ruining the story for people that want to read it.I do enjoy a good fantasy story now and then and this was a great one. The author does a wonderful job of pulling you into the story and making you want to keep reading way into the wee hours. I loved the characters and I was excited to discover that this is a series. I've also heard this is based on a story by the Grimm Brothers, but I've never read it. This book makes me want to seek out the original and read it. I'm also putting the second book on my wish list."
5,The Goose Girl,"This book was very fun to read. It was longer so there was more story! This is one princess story that was very different from the rest. It's more interesting that way. I first wanted to read this book because I've met the author. When I finally did read it I wasn't a bit disappointed. This book was about a princess trying to fit in, and live up to the leadership role of her mother. When she is unsuccessful at that she turns to talking to animals. People think she is weird but she finally fits in, even if it's not who she expected she would fit in with. This was a great book it had some romance in it to."
5,An amazing retelling,"This is one of the top ten best young adult fairy tale retellings I have read, and I thought it was excellent. Other versions of the Goose Girl fairytale have disappointed me, but Shannon Hale's book succeeded. Princess Anidori, Ani, is the Crown princess to the throne of Kildenree until her mother (the queen) announces that her younger brother will claim the throne and she will be married to the prince of Bayern, a country bordering Kildenree. Ani, weak and indecisive, is on her way to the country when half her honor guard massacres all those loyal to her and try to kill her in an attempt to make Selia, her lady-in-waiting, the queen.Ani runs, and through the kindness of a few good people, survives and ends up as a goose girl in Bayern. She must find a way to reclaim her name, though, and soon--for the prince's marraige to Selia/Anidori is fast approaching and war is on the verge of breaking loose."
5,My Review,"This is book is an outstanding masterpiece with humor, romance and strong words. I would recommend this book to ages 10-20.Anidori-Kiladra Talianna Isilee (Ani) was born Crown Princess of Kildenree.In the first part of the book 'Crown Princess' the narator tells a bit about Ani's life when she was younger. The narator introduces Selia, her Aunt, the queen and the king, and how the queen takes her off her rightful throne to be married to a prince in far-away Bayern.So Ani and her guards, and mercinaries, and Selia set off to Bayern. On the way there Selia, with the gift of people speaking, enchants the mercinaries and some of the guards to work for her cause and take Ani away and replace Ani with Selia. Only a few loyal guards were left and Ani thought that they were all dead. So Ani has to run from them, without taking her special horse.Then it goes into the next part of the book 'Goose Girl' in which she becomes a goose girl to disguise who she really is..."
5,awsome book!,i am 15 and i absolutely loved this book!! i could not put it down and there is absolutely nothing that upset me or made me regret buying the book. any girl or woman would love this book it has a little for every type of person to enjoy i asume boys would like it as well....good good book
4,Someone else actually knows this fairy tale,"For years I thought I was the only person on the planet familiar with the fairy tale of the Goose Girl. How thrilled I was to read a novel based upon the story!Shannon Hale, as most writers of fairy tale retalings, goes an extra step to make a threat of warfare behind the simple story of a betrayed princess.Ani is a princess with a load of responsibilities and loyalties, including an arranged marriage with the purpose of creating a union between two kingdoms. She also happens to have a special gift--speaking to nature (which fits very well into the original fairytale).This is a story full of the usual romance and adventure, but it also packs an extra dose of magic and a surprisingly delightful addition of political strategy.A great read"
3,Robin McKinley does it better,"I honestly think I would have enjoyed this story much more if I had not just finished ""Spindle's End"" by Robin McKinley. McKinley creates such magical, real worlds that draw you in and that book also had a princess that could talk to animals and horses that I found immensely more fascinating and well-written than anything Shannon did with this book. I found ""Goose Girl"" a poor imitation that was desperately drawn out. I was unimpressed, but kept pressing forward hoping for something better.I spent most of the book yelling at Ani for being an idiot. She was brave, then shy, then whiny. Actually, I always found her whiny.And the constant comparisons! The sky was like a moth in flight. He touched her hair like a crow to a shiny object. Ugh. You could invent a drinking game by the uses of ""like.""Final verdict: Not impressed. I didn't find the world fascinating. The writing was verbose and needlessly drawn out. I found myself wishing McKinley would write it."
4,Loved it,"I started reading it on recommendation from a friend with no background knowledge of the story. A few chapters in, I was hooked! It is a unique and clever storyline with characters you learn to adore, and villains you hate. It's a fantasy tale, but depicts enough real human emotion for readers to really be able to connect with it. I definitely recommend it."
3,"A good read, but not her best work","Even if you didn't like the book, you must agree that it was well written. Shannon Hale does a marvelous job of story-telling. Some of it was predictable, but the characterization was fantastic and the world she creates easy to visualize. There is one thing I'll bring up for those concerned with content. One of the characters tells a story about women baring their breasts. It was an unnecessary addition to anotherwise perfectly clean story. All three of the books in this trilogy have things in them that really could have been left out and been much better books for it. I'd recommend ""Princess Academy"" before recommending this one."
2,"Scannos, Scannos, everywhere...","The Kindle version of this book is FULL of scannos. The book was obviously scanned from a paper copy, and not proofed at all. The author's name is misspelled in one part, and the main character's name (Ani) is misspelled (as Am) about 30% of the time.Bloomsbury: This kind of quality from ebooks is horrid. I am not likely to buy another bloomsbury book until I know that you will provide me with the quality I pay for.(the story itself was great... but the kindle version is horrid)"
3,And they lived happily ever after...,"A bout of insomnia did me in for this book. I read it till three o' clock. I liked it, and there was nothing wrong with it. But I'm definetily not going to read this book again. There have been books in where I read them over and over, until i scare my friends.The Goose Girl? Um, it's been done before, so it's like i read the same book with different titles. But Ms. Hale wrote the idea quite well.Yhe Goose girl meets the handsome prince, and they fall in love, but he's getting married so he writes her a cheesy letter(the only terrible part of this book) and they march off to a fake war, but the goose girl warns them in time, thus saving lives, including oh-so-princly Geric.And whether they lived happliy ever after i can only assume.If i can't have everything my way, you'll have nothing yours.-Qoute taken from a rather inspiring fit my sister had."
1,CAUTION!,"While this book is captivating, it is VERY mature. If you do not want your daughter reading about women baring their breasts so their enemies can raise their bastard children and other equally disturbing sexual innuendo (which this book is chock full of) please read it yourself first and decide if it is appropriate for your daughter. I found it to be appropriate for high school but no younger and absolutely not sixth grade. Please do not put this series in the same category as Hale's book, ""Princess Academy""."
2,PRODUCT DIED AFTER 1 MONTH OF USE,"I suppose this might be a good product. However, after a month of use, it completely stopped functioning. (Batteries are not the issue.) Because I purchased it 4 months previously (it sat for 3 months during the summer without being used) I cannot return this defective product.Save your money!"
1,Disappointed,This item arrived with a broken cover hinge. I'm not sure how to exchange it.Thanks for your help.
2,absolute crap,"ok so i bought this figuring it will help me with essays and homework. I firgured this would not be the best, but would do its job and that what i wanted. Well it doesnt. First of all the dictionary isnt completely accurate. The Thesaurus and calculator are good. When this came to my door, i was expecting something smaller, and more sleek. This is huge (bigger than my hand) heavy and the letters are huge. They take up the whole screen, so you have to scroll to the sides and up and down to read the words. Overall its junk, its not worth the money, get something a bit more so its worth the money."
3,"Ok, but many flaws","The Franklin Spelling Ace is pretty good with games, thesaurus, and spell check, but the display was designed poorly. The screen has huge print and you have to scroll constantly to read the full definition of a word. The auto scrolling is too slow and it can very tedious to read definitions. There is a list feature to put in your own words for future reference. The games are enjoyable. I originally got this a few years ago hoping to use it as a quick dictionary, but many of the words I looked up either weren't included or didn't have a definition. Also, similar words all had the same exact definitions, which didn't help when trying to find the best word to use in a situation or when trying to distinguish one word from another. If you are in elementary school it should be a good tool, but if you are older you should consider a better tool for more quality defintions."
3,Not as pleased as the rest,I bought this book based on everyones reviews. I felt as though it encourged my child to be louder than ever. I dont think it gave the message to be who you are. If you want a book about being happy with who you are buy John Lithgrows book Marsupial Sue. It comes with a great cd that the kids love to sing along with. And it gets the message across better.
1,There are lots better books out there,"This book does not encourage kids to be who they are.... rather it encourages acting out. I believe there is a time and place for everything. This author believes that it's ok for kids to cry, or laugh 'loudly' in all environments and circumstances. A negative message in my mind.By the way, one of the many marvels that Sam sees in the big city is ""A dog with gas"". Complete with a picture of a dog breaking wind.If you want a book that encourages kids to be themselves pick up a copy of ""Giraffes Cant Dance"". This has a very positive message."
5,"Good Book, Great Price","This makes for a good second book on Linear Algebra. If you aren't familiar with some of the basic concepts of linear algebra such as determinants, eigenvalues, or matrices, this book probably isn't for you. You should also have some experience with a more proof-oriented approach to mathematics. If you do, you'll get a lot out of this book. The best part is, it's only $12. You won't find another linear algebra book this good for anywhere near that price."
2,not good,"i was expecting something understandable. If you are interested to learn Linear Algebra don't start with this book, because it is very hard to follow."
4,a new subject for me,"First up, I will say that I am no scholar.My background was in a pentecostal church.I remember walking out of a meeting one afternoon, and expressing my disagreements with the speakers thoughts about locusts? and fighter-jets.My fellow members shot at me a poisoned look :)I have only recently heard the term, amillennialism.And I found this book fascinating.Having moved away from the pentecostal environment a few years ago, and now embracing reformed teaching, I think I can say gladly that amillennialism will lead me to further reading.Hoekema is next."
3,"Good, but not great","I found ""A Case For Amillennialism"" to be a good Amillennial treatment of the biblical eschatological issues relating them to both Pre-millennialism and Post millennialism. However, the one big problem was the Author's connection of Amillennialism with Covenant Theology. The author is clearly in the Covenant Theology camp and fails to properly differentiate the two systems at times. One may hold to an Amillennial view point without accepting the viewpoint of Covenant Theology. As one who holds to New Covenant Theology and also holds an Amillennial viewpoint, I would encourage those reading this book to realize this distinction. Overall, however, the author clearly expressed the A-mill position and revealed the exegetical difficulties of the other positions concerning the important eschatological texts and the general flow of scripture."
5,What More Can Be Said?,"This book is a very helpful volume if you are wanting to learn more about the problems with various eschatological viewpoints. It is also an able defense of amillennialism, that in conjunction with Anthony Hoekema's monumental book, proves quite convincing.The time to refute the Hal Linseys, Van Impes, and their courtiers is here. This book is a very present help for that burden."
4,"Good, but a little dull","""A Case for Amillenialism"" by Kim Riddlebarger is a great defense of amillenialism against dispensational premillenialism and postmillenialism, as well as a moderate introduction to the doctrine of the view.There are two reasons why I only gave it 4 stars. First, it was a little dull. Reading it soon after Keith Mathison's ""Postmillenialsim: An Eschatology of Hope"", I found ""Amillenialism"" to be quite a bit duller. It took me a while to get through it. But, it does go deep, no doubt. It just takes a while.Second, I wish he would have provided a stronger argument agaist preterism.Other than those two things, I'd say this is the most accessible volume on the topic of amillenial eschatology.In all thigs, soli Deo gloria."
1,"Response to ""Riddled with errors""","Thanks for pointing that out dullbot. I thought I was the only one who noticed Riddlebarger and his peers spend more time disproving ""Strawman"" theology that proving their own.Anyone thinking of buying this book do your homework first by reading Riddlebarger's blog at kimriddlebarger.squarespace.com, you may find his thesis ""Riddled"" with errors."
2,"Helpful, but limited study","Riddlebarger has written a helpful summary of the amillennial eschatology. His book is especially helpful when it counters the dispensational view, but is not as effective in countering postmillennialism.If you want to know what drives the amillennial outlook, this is a helpful (though deficient) book. For those interested in seeing a postmillennial response to some of the key arguments, see: Kenneth Gentry, ed., Thine Is the Kingdom (Chalcedon). It would have been interesting to see how Riddlebarger would have responded to Gentry's counter-arguments. Maybe in a second edition!"
3,socked in nothing else to watch.,Not his best work. Ended very abruptly and the only money theme was hard to find throughout the whole movie.
1,It's only money,"I spent to much money for a Blu Ray film, thinking it would be in color. I did see the fine print that it's a black & white film. You won't get my money again, that's for sure."
1,Weak Steel used,"I had purchased the Vaughan Nail Puller 9"" to remove 3 inch nails that had been hammered deep under the wood. After a few use of the nail puller the tip of it started to wear. Most likely the nail is stronger in material than the Vaughan puller. This was a cheap gamble where I only paid $13 for the 9 incher but I thought you guys should know what you're buying first. I wish there are tools made out of Tungsten, super hard and last an extremely long time.Overall, I'm unsatisifed with the soft material used. Probably didn't add enough carbon to harden the steel."
5,<3,"I actually got to see this performed back in the day on a field trip, I believe. My mom bought a cassette if anyone remembers what they are anymore, lol. So this purchase was more of a nostalgic/sentimental buy more than anything. Cassette tapes only last so long, I was thrilled when I found this in CD format. I play this in the car and my nephews love it. :)"

1,Horrible Pan,"I bought two of these pans thinking that they would be high quality; I was sadly mistaken. Shortly after placing in the oven they warped out of shape and never went back to being flat even after they cooled! They may be non-stick for cookies but don't try using them to hold individual baking dishes. When they pop out of shape, you'll have a real mess on your hands."
5,This product is great,I still have these after a few years and they still look like I bought them yesterday. So if your looking for greatcookie sheets I highly advise you to get these.
4,Great Book...as expected with anything Gracie!,"The Gracies, along with that Kid...what's his name...Peligro, have put out another great book. A must have for beginners to advanced. I add advanced in there because it is a great tool for Instructors and/or for those who have forgotten ""where they came from"". The only reason it didn't get five stars is because the books are produced with pages that are only slightly thicker than tissue paper. I wouldn't mind paying a little extra for for the type of pages the Gracies have used in previous books."
4,Nice addition,"As an experienced black belt Judo, with a long competition history, I loved this book very much. I am always searching to expand my technical skills. And this BJJ handbook gives me more inspiration to drill my students and myself to new skills."
5,"A pleasure to read, and worth several reads","I've just spent two happy days reading this book, meeting some fascinating people within its covers. It's a surprising book, like a house with secret rooms, and it leads into some beautiful philosophical terrain. The author talks about epiphanies and changes that take place when one sets about building one's own home, or even a bookcase: the flash of enlightenment that comes when you understand, and know what to do next, and realize in that second that you are on the journey to becoming a carpenter.But Mr. Ehrenhaft is honest, and very correctly describes the owner-builder process as ""more than crushingly hard work,"" albeit somewhat mitigated by the sheer joy of doing it well.I've been building houses longer than many people have been alive, and I learned a few things from this book. The art and science of carpentry is information-rich, and you'd have to live several lifetimes to acquire all of it. Proud to have this book on my shelf."
3,Interesting stories well told,"Stories of people who often labored alone in remote locations. Similar to Tracy Kiddder's ""House"" in that it investigates the adult lives of its subjects. As in that book, some building knowledge is passed along, although this is not a how-to book. Its succcess is due mainly to the author's ability to present these characters in a sympathetic way, holding us with his story telling ability and entertaining us with his wry observations."
4,A thoughtful essay,"The title THE BUILDER'S SECRET is not a secret at all, just ask any owner builder. This book is a thoughtful treatise on the pleasure of creating something and watching your ideas take on a three dimension shape. To get the maximum pleasure, you must become physically involved in the actual construction. Most people never have had this opportunity. To sit back in your own creation, at night in front of the fireplace, with a cold wind outside is an unforgettable experience. George Ehrenhaft has captured the essence of such an experience in his book, narrating his experiences and fleshing it out with extensive interviews with others who have done the same. It is a thoughtful piece of research, well done. You will be inspired! Paul G. McHenry, Architect"
4,This @%$#& house.,"This is not a how-to-build or remodel book--instead its a why-to-build book; a collection of stories about nine different weekend-builders who decided to take the plunge and improve their own homes. You will see yourself in this book--prepare to laugh and cry, maybe at the same time."
5,I loved it--a marvelous read!,"George Ehrenhaft says girls--GIRLS!--can build and fix stuff--and what news this is! The book is just wonderful and inspired me to greater heights (at least the roof) and even if I fail sheetrock this weekend, I'll try again. The book really is inspiring--and funny--and very,very wise. Ehrenhaft must have been a stellar English teacher."
3,"Off logo, fold creases","The logo on this flag is off, the circle in the center of the star is actually NOT in the center of the star and the triangles on top of the wings are off too. Also the flag comes in a bag so when you take it out there are major creases in it that don't go away for a very long time. For the $5 I paid for it it served its purpose as a patriotic decoration in my dorm room but if you plan on actually hanging this somewhere like outdoors I would invest in a better quality flag."
1,If you have Air Force pride - Do NOT buy this,"Poor quality printing on poor quality fabric, poorly folded. Very disrespectful to the Air Force flag. Poor value no matter what the price. Proves a point - if it seems too good to be true..."
5,Air Force-MILITARY FLAG,"My husbandand I bought this flag as a gift for a friend,who had been in the air force.He has it flying high over his camper at the camp grounds.He is very pleased with his gift.Also many people have commented on his new flag,and how much they like it.It was not expensive,is made well and looks very nice!If we hadnt been completely satisfied with it we would have returned it.We are very happy with it."
3,New Style Air Force Flag,My issue with this is I ordered the New Style and Received the old style. I did not have time to send it back and wait for a new one because we were having a send off party for our daughter before she left for Military Basic Training and Tech School... Would have preferred the New Style since that is what they use now ( still a little disappointed about that) but it worked and it is still Air Force.Price is good.Colors on the Old Style were true to colors used on it. Do not have it hung outside so do not know how fast it would fade-live in the south and our flag pole is in direct sunlight most of the day.Probably would have gave it 4 stars for the correct flag.
2,"Nice compact size, weak water flow","The shower head is attractive, but it has a very weak flow. I believe that is because on its inside the area that funnels water has one part with a very small hole. A handy person could certainly just make the hole bigger with a drill bit, but I was too lazy to, so I just bought a different one. Not a bad shower head say, for short-term guests, but if you're going to use it every day, get out your drill."
5,this a film i really enjoyed watching and it a very serious film and it opened my eyes big time,love this film i would tell my girlfriends to get a copy for them self and get sum of their friends to watch it too
5,Great Movie,"This movie was better than I thought. At first I just pass it up in the video store, but then decided to purchase it. Boy was I happy that I did. This movie will make you cry, laugh & get angry. Very good choice if you are undecided."
3,viewer,"I think the movie did not go into as much detail as the book , and aslo it should have moor of a movie thyme and also Mr jakes was seen to much. but i did enjoy the book it was much better."
4,Don't Miss This One,A powerful film with gritty performances by an excellent cast. Sobering but hopeful story. Kimberly Elise & Loretta Devine powerfully portray a painful mother-daughter relationship -- very heartbreaking and gut-wrenching. Bishop T.D. Jakes is a strong plus to this film. Well worth seeing. 4+ stars.
3,Inspirational but tough to watch,"My heart went out to the women in this movie. I'm sure it was made to touch the lives of those who have gone thru the hell to realize redemption. It makes me thankful that I had the kind of daddy that would have moved the earth if anyone had hurt me. The actresses really fleshed-out their roles and found the essence of their characters. It was the men who were cartoonish. God bless you, Rev. Jakes, but please stick to preaching. You do that great."
5,Inspirational,Every time I watch this movie I get a different message. This was an uplifting inspirational movie. Especially when they show the man of God. This movie was sad at times but also very real about sexual molestation and it's effects.
5,tammy duncan is an idiot,"tammy duncan is a complete moron who needs to wake up and enter the real world. she thinks that ""livving in reality"" consists of drug dealers not raping people... come on be serious. not everyone is niave and loves ""god"" like you ignorant people do. some people have higher intelligence than that. If you seriously think that people can just ""edit"" a rape or violence out of life and it be more realistic or take out the profanity to be in the real world, you obviously need to take your head out of your preacher's *ss and wake up. Real people don't rate movies on a god's movie rating scale. There is no god. And even if your diluted mind thinks there is one, he wouldn't watch movies. There are far too many annoying christians in christianburg, VA to ""answer prayers"" for. Give me a break. Enter the 21st century. GROW UP"
2,This one is a yawner,"Nothing special. Sad, yet empowering. Should have prepared myself for such horrible acts to happen in the church prior to watching this movie."
3,This book would be great EXCEPT,"I got hooked on pixel puzzles after trying them in the book that Amazon sells called, ""The Mind Challenge Puzzle Book"". While it is edited by different people and has a different publishing company, beware! The pixel puzzles in ""The Mind Challenge"" are EXACTLY the same (no more, no less) as the ones in ""Perplexing Pixel Puzzles""! So, I would reccomend the ""Mind-Sharpening Pixel Puzzles"" book instead, if you have already done the ones in the ""Mind Challenge"" book."
3,where am I?,"While I love doing this type of puzzle, I find the grid lines in this book to be so light and the squares so small that it is difficult to work the puzzles. I would recommend Games Magazine's Paint by Numbers over this book only for this reason. It has darker grid lines and larger squares. Although the puzzles do not have as many squares as these puzzles do, I find them challenging and fun without the frustration of loosing your place and coloring in squares in the wrong row or column."
4,Franklin HW 216 Homework Wiz Plus,My ten year old daugther is making great use out of the Franklin HW 216. In the car on the way to school she can easily review her spelling words. The big display is great for easy spell checking and the hangman game helps with the spelling too. The problem with the device is that it is very difficult to get the very small philips head screw out of the battery lid so that the four AAA bateries can be installed. I ended after almost an hour of trying opitcal screw drivers having to drill out the screw with a fine drill. Franklin customer service says this is a problem that they are aware of and hope to re-design the battery compartment in the future.
1,Item never came,"A month and a half later and after two contacts with the seller, item has never arrived. What a waste of money, what a disappointment with the seller and with the Amazon experience. Go to a bookstore and pay the extra price for quality experience, service, etc."
4,Your Z-car will love you for it!,"I saw this book long before I bought it, and after buying it, I was very sorry I took so long to get it! It covers most every aspect of the full restoration of this beloved car. From the frame-up or a little at a time. This book has the info you need, and more. The info inside can not be purchased, borrowed, or stolen for a better price! Alone, this book is not enough, but it's a great way to get the spark ignited. (No single book could possibly have everything, I know, I have bought almost all of 'em.)"
3,works but not a 100% bolt on,i got the Curt Manufacturing 19020 6 In Drop Step Bumper Hitch it looked nice tried to bolt it to my k1500 step bumper and i had to cut out some the lip on the bumper so the hitch would sit flat but the hitch did work i just towed 4888 pound trailer from nj to ohio with no problems so all in all a great buy
5,The older version is the best!!,I needed a Strongs at my parents house. I will be visiting them more as they age. Thank you so much for the excellent quality.
3,Too much dialogue,"Oh my God, if people really talked like the main character, every listener would die of boredom. This plot was OK, but slogging through the tons of stupid dialogue was incredibly miserable. I'm surprised the author didn't try and put pictures of facial expressions in, too!"
4,A little heavy but overall a hit!,"We bought this tiara for our 4 year old, all-princess-all-the-time daughter's birthday. She loved it and wore it to preschool the next day. It's quite lovely. My only complaint is that it's a little heavy and so would slip down her head sometimes. Basically, it's not a run around the moonbounce type of tiara. It's a sit and walk elegantly or play quielty with your other princess dolls type of tiara.A few months later... she still likes it but it's really too unweildy for every day wear. On the other hand, she wears the foam crowns that we made at her party (see my other review) all the time! She wears them to school, just around the house, to Thanksgiving dinner since it was fancy (!!!). I'm still glad we bought it (adorable photos) but you may not get tons of use out of it."
1,sketching for morons,"This DVD is a complete waste of time. The artist makes a thumbnail sketch, enlarges it on a photocopier and then spends the rest of the DVD tracing it and finally shading it. This is worse than sketching for dummies. It is sketching for total morons. A complete waste of money."
3,Good product Bad transaction,"Nature's Gate Organics Forget Your Lines, (1.1 fl oz) (32 ml)I recieved this product very promptly and that was good. But the bottle was missing the 'pump-like' thing to dispense the product. Despite complaining about it, nothing was done...so that was disappointing.As for the product, it smells and feels good."
4,"Functional, handy","This was a great bag for a day ride. I put my camera, cell phone, MP3 player, granola bars, chapstick, sunscreen, propel packets and a few other smaller things in it. One bad thing, the bracket was too big for my handlebars, and even though it came with adapters to fill the space, one wasn't enough, and two was too much. I ended up using electrical tape around my handlebars where the brackets would sit for a tighter fit, but when I got the bag loaded,it started to slip downwards as I road my bike (I do have a heavy camera, though). Otherwise this bag was great, I love that it snaps right off and becomes a fanny pack, that was the best. Considering the contents, I didn't want to leave the bag on my bike and this was a great option for be to be able to snap it off of the bike and wear it as a fanny pack at our stops. Couldn't really fit any extra clothes in it, just the essentials."
3,Durability a ?,"I've had this bag for about a year, but have only used it as a fanny pack 3-4 times. The last time I used it, the stitching on one side of the belt holding the clip unraveled and the bag fell off while I was riding my bike. Otherwise, I've been satisfied with it capacity and general construction (Note: it can be found cheaper at other outdoor/bicycling stores)."
4,Small but functional,"I found the bag to be smaller than I had expected, somewhat smaller than a standard handlebar bag. But it seems to suit our purposes. I am using it currently as my purse as I commute to work and I can keep wallet, phone, and a couple small personal items including a soft glasses case. It helps to stave off ""large bag purse"" syndrome.My complaints are only two:1) It is sometimes challenging to remove it off the clip. After a number of removals (I have to do this every day) it does get easier, but the bottom of the bag then gets softer and that ofsets the clip becoming easier to unclip.2) It rides in such a position on my handlebars that the light that I have clipped to the bag's accessory bracket (nice feature, by the way)is sometimes obscured by the bag, or at least diminished.Despite these two things, I really do like it."
4,It's good- particularly with STI,"This bag is pretty handy. It is small enough that if you have Shimano STI shifters, it will ride between the shift cables without bending them. In order to use the waist pack feature, you have to bring along the extension strap. I never do because the bag is pretty small and there is no room to carry the strap.It does come off easy, and I carry it by the handle."
4,Ok for the Money,"Not really impressed with the mounting CAM. Does not leave a huge range of motion. However, If installed and left in place then the light is great."
2,Too Small!,"I read the reviews that said this was a snug fit, but ignored them. Learn from my mistake and listen when I say this sucker is a tight fit! My 7yo son is a stringbean(4'6"" and 57 lbs) so I figured a 'slim' fit would be fine for him. When he put it on, it just fit with the straps fully extended and the bottom of the jacket skimming his belly button. It fits his 4yo brother perfectly (he's 42 lbs), so we kept it for him."
1,Sizing Wrong,I was told they would fit children 50-90 lbs. No way they could not buckle them and the straps do not adjust. A few four year olds visited the boat and they were just right for them.
3,tight and bulky,"this is a cheap and effective back up life vest which works well in a boat or on a canoe if your kid is not feeling too active. However, for an active kid in a kayak or canoe it rides a little high and is too bulky. My kids found it quite uncomfortable to wear and also a little on the small side. I give it three stars for the price but will probably replace it next year."
5,Wish I had purchased this long ago.....,"Perfect for 24V systems. Super easy to install and the three levels of charging (including maintenance charge mode will be perfect for off season storage. Best part is that I no longer have to switch my old deep cycle charger to each battery, taking hours to get all 3 batteries fully charged. A little more expensive than the 2 bank chargers, but definitely worth it!"
3,Sizing,"It would be helpful to know the chest sizes for other than just the small jacket. What do I buy for a 42"" chest?"
2,Long Term Report,"I have had two of these, in the last eight years, they last four years then one of the banks either stops working or overcharges your battery.I boat in the North, this product only gets used 6-7 months a year.Warranty is three years, very convenient?Good Luck"
5,Good life vest,"I am female, 5' 5"" and about 120 lbs and the small vest fits me well. The upper part is just mesh and nylon, which is perfect because it doesn't restrict arm movements at all. The vest sits higher up than other life vests, which makes it good for sitting down (in a kayak or raft). The vest appears to be well made and has several adjustment straps to customize the fit around your body. The flotation part of the vest seems a little thicker than other life vests, but i haven't had to use it in the water yet. The colors (I got tan) are as advertised."
1,Way smaller than advertised,This item is way smaller than advertised. My son is fairly skinny and weighs close to 50lbs and it was too tight for him!
5,Great for Paddling,We have two Kayaks that we just paddle around in. Traditional life vest are extremely bulky around the arms. This design has worked out very nicely!
2,not very good,"bought this hose and pump and it leaked gas really bad at every hose clamp , i had to replace every hose clamp , and the hose gets extremely stiff in cold weather, just save ur time and just buy a ball pump and go to auto parts store and buy some fuel line and hose clamps"
5,Hand Held GPS,This hand held GPS unit easy to use. Easy to learn.Easy prompts to follow...came in very handy unexpecetedly...Good Buy! Lent it to friends to use they could manage it.
1,Way To Small-Waste Of Time,Do not waste your time. This vest does not fit the range of weight for children that the product details state. My daughter is 62 pounds and the collar of the vest was way too tight. The body of it was also way too tight. Totally uncomfortable.
1,too small!,I purchased this for my son who is 6 yrs. old and weighs 51 lbs. This life vest supposedly fits 50-90lbs. When we tried it on it was so small. It did not close on him! I returned it and Amazon was extremely accommodating by shipping me out another style with upgraded shipping! I was pleased with Amazon's service.
3,well adjust,Kept me a float that's really all that mattered.The foam is not very conforming but I expected that so it met my expectations. It adjusts well and as previously stated it kept me afloat. Can't ask for more than that
2,"Size is not true, but with good value","Bought 2 of this vest for my 9 years old daughter and 7 years old son. This vest rated to fit 50 to 90 lb kids. Unfortunately this vest can barely fit my daughter and she is only 62 lb. She also complain the front are too high and too tight and not comfortable at all. After few adjusting she finally feel better but still not comfortable. Since this vest cost only $18 I don't want to spend extra $6 to $7 to ship back for refund. So I have her hang on it for this year, and get her a new one next year!However, this vest do fit perfectly on my son and he is only 48 lb. and he didn't complain any at all. BTW, my kids are in group of small and thin size!The vest do have very nice materials and not too heavy, for the price point it is excellent. But buyer do have to watch out for the fitment. I don't think this vest can fit any kids over 60 lb."
4,Excellent floatation!,"Bought this for my 5 year old son who is 42 lbs. He was too big for the smaller size, and this size worked tightened up as much as it would go. The only negative is that it did ride up on him, but he did not seem to mind. We used it in the Gulf and in the pool."
3,Good but with some issues,"I never had to actually float with this on, but I used it on a fishing trip and found that while driving a small boat with an outboard motor and trolling at the same time, my arm had to rest against the mesh material and after a while it would get quite uncomfortable. I would have liked for the body of the vest to be a little taller in a 2xl size. The buckle came across about mid belly rather than lower on the waist."
3,Where's the pockets?,"The description reads: ""2 large zippered storage pockets, tool pocket, snack pocket, and handwarmer pockets"" All it has is 2 SMALL zippered pockets period. If you have very small hands, you might be able to fit your hands in them.... but nothing else. The flotation material takes up all the room! Other than the lack of ANY storage areas, it's a nice vest!"
4,Stearns Fishing/Paddling vest,"This vest was just what I was looking for, looks good and has plenty of room and features.The fold down tray is very handy but I found out the hard way that the added few inches of vest there in the front provides an obstacle when trying to self rescue back onto your kayak. It does float a big guy like me though."
3,OK if all features worked,"Size is right, doesn't leak yet. However, the fuel line out which is supposed to rotate, does not. I managedto attach the fuel line and am getting by with it being in the fixed location. I would have returned it though if it wasn't such a painto do so."
3,Not what I expected,Wasn't as nice as it looks on line. Doesn't fit all sizes. The price should of been the clue .
5,great product,"I expected alot lower quality due to price, however this product is great. It is better than most brands I found in stores and yes extremely cheaper."
3,not a good fit for a woman,This vest was well made but was an uncomfortable fit for a woman- probably would be OK for a man.
4,Nice PDF/vest,"Amazon's price was excellent!I bought this mostly for fly fishing, which I do in wading and boats. The vest has decent storage for wading, and it is size-adjustable enough to wear over different clothing. The vest is Coast Guard approved for most boat use so no need exists to have or wear another device when in a drift boat or in my kayak on a lake. I would buy again."
1,not the same....,"I bought 2 body glove rash shirts from sports authority and two from here, and they are not the same. These ones where much longer...I constantly have to be tucking it in my kids shorts or folding it up fromthe bottom...very annoying to swim like this. I would not buy this product again."
4,Too small for 8 year old,"It is a good product, except it was too tight for my 8 year old son (75Lbs). I expected to use it for at least 2-3 years, but it looks like we will need a new one next year. Overall quality is very good, the vast dries up within 20 min in case you get into water. I would recommend to buy it at 40 Lbs to be able to use it for several years, it seems durable enough to sustain several seasons of boating."
5,Great Vest,"I'm a large man and this vest fit me very well with no problems, also very easy to move around in."
5,Very Comfortable,"Fits nice for kayaking, and doesn't get in the way. It rides up in the back a bit on the seat, but so would any other vest. It wasn't the least bit hot when it was 75 and sunny."
1,CURSED IS RIGHT!!!!!,Save your hard earned money folks and by pass this loser of a film. I gave it a one because NEGATIVE ZERO was not available! So to sum this film up...Cursed????...Yes I cursed after spending $$$ to rent the DVD! When will they ever put out a good scary movie! BLA Bla Bla...
1,The Horrible Cursed!,"Uninspired, uneven, unoriginal, cliche ridden script sinks this turkey, Wes Craven couldn't possibly have been responsible for this disasterous movie. The producers or the talentless staff at Dimension Films that released it are responsible. What pinhead came up with the idea of releasing a Wes Craven film!!!at the theater as a PG familyish film! they should be canned on the spot!. This gorier version still doesn't cut the mustard in the plot development department and the computer generated werewolf is not scary...can anyone say FAKE!, I'm bored of this review. Take my advice and rent the stunning 'Ginger Snaps' instead, a werewolf movie that's superior in every which way imaginable."
2,hm.. let me think. NO.,"The commercial for the movie made it seem like it was going to be 'really scary.' but after I saw the movie, I was rather disappointed. The movie was not scary at all. and I had gotten my hopes up for something really good before I saw it in theaters. the first thing that I want people to understand, is that if you are expecting a true horror film, this is NOT it.but even though it was not scary, it was a fairly interesting movie. you want to know what happens, so no, you don't get bored easily. it was an 'ok' movie. but after I saw it, I knew that I did NOT want it. Don't see this movie. It's a waste of time."
3,Nice,"Not being into these kind of movies, I thought that Cursed was a nice piece . Not as good as I thought it would be but.. nice. Replay value for me is low but overall the acting is good and it can be pretty grose which is good :)"
2,"Wes Craven, go back to Elm Street please","Hey Wes Craven, i like your Nitemare on Elm Street series but this is not ur cup of tea. It is bad enough that the pace of this movie is slow but when you add Chachi from Happy Days to play a small role here, you know where this is headed. Who wrote the dialogue for Curse anyways. If this is your day job, quit man. It is just a typical run in the mill howlers for all you wolf masters out there. Ricci is a good actress and she does a good job with what is given for her part but the dialogue stinks. I actually fell asleep so i do apologies for not being able to tell you if the ending is anti-climatic or not...then again, let's assume it is....would i recommend this movie for good entertainment fun? ..LOL that is funny.This is the type of movie you show on Mystery Science Theater 3000 but not for the big dance. It's 80s style cheesewhiz gore....if you into those, then watch it. Just be prepare to doze off."
3,Better watch the Unrated Version,"I always admiring for any Wes Craven movies because I found that he's very talented in making a horror movies. I came with a big expectation with Cursed, because of Wes and Kevin Williamson. The duo had a dynamic job when doing Scream, which is one of my favorite movies. Sadly, even though it fairly enjoyable, but absolutely lack of the spirit of the duo.Cursed just a plain and simple movie with no logic whatsoever. I think Wes and Kevin could easyly replace by anybody, because this movie is so lack what fans expect from them. Well, actually a PG-13 horror movies ussualy are not so good and it proved it! Luckyly, the unrated version is out and it got more blood and gore, reminiscent Wes Craven classic. So, I just recommended you to watch the unrated version instead. It got a lot of fun with the extras!"
2,A BOGUS LET DOWN !,The beginning was great & then it took such a nose-dive that i got whip-lash from the impact! What a let down! Wes Craven can do so much better then this crap that he's been putting out for the last 8 years. It looks like he's chosen money over art!
5,Glad I saw it,I wanted to see this movie the day it came out and never got the chance... I asked my closest friends and relatives how it was and most of them said it was ok but not scary or a 5 STAR rated movie Which is not true. All these other reviews are plain stupid CURSED is definitley a good movie its original..juicy..and has a great looking cast it also has unexpected scenes so theres nothing to predict (thats what makes it so good). Im glad i saw it to give it my own opinion Its anoother great one from Craven. Well long story short.. Ignore other reviews Give it your own.
4,A lot better,"Better then the TV showing of this movie except one time I must have seen the X rated version. Because the garage scene werewolf made the hair on the back of my neck stand up, even though I knew it was just a picture. I caught myself looking for a way out. All kinds of bells, lights and whistles were going off in my head, which hardly ever happens. That panic button sensation faded after half a day, but the memory is still with me. This movie has the eyes, just not the rest of the face that made it so believable. They left out the brutal nasty scene of the werewolf's face just before he pounced on the car looking for the terrified woman, making her panic real. This is what makes the rest of the movie really come to life. Wes Craven gets my vote on his super werewolf version of this movie."
5,This Movie is The BEST!,"Honestly, I think everyone who see this movie should love it. It has suspense comedy, romance, and just something everybody can relate to. This movie has a lot of jumpy parts (according to me). I saw it in theaters and I love it. I even bought the soundtrack. I just love it. You must see this! It's one of the best i have seen this year!!!!!~Michael~"
3,Not as bad as everyone says...,"""Cursed"" is not a great film, but I like it in spite of its flaws. It's definitely silly, but is layered with lots of humor to let everyone know that it's making fun of itself.I've always liked Christina Ricci, but this isn't her best moment. Jesse Eisenberg is the real star, and he's given all the best moments (and the best lines). For some reason, I enjoyed seeing Scott Baio working again. The DVD has lots of gratuitous stuff, with the cast & filmmakers talkng about how great their vision really was. A lot of bull, but entertaining, nonetheless. The bottom line is that it isn't that great, but I was really entertained with the performance of Jesse Eisenberg, which kept it from being a total dud."
2,"Somebody get a silver bullet, quick!","Two stars for some of the special effects...but, one star without. The story is jumbled but easy to predict. The ""stars"" read their lines as if they were ordering hockey tickets by phone and even the ""celeb appearances"" were lame. What a waste of two hours (it seemed a lot longer)."
2,Could have been better,"Christina Ricci's talent was wasted on this movie, the gore was kept low and the werewolf was hilarious. But I did have a good time watching it. Several moments were just hilarious but I'm glad I waited for the rental release."
2,This movie was cursed!,"I gave it two stars because the story had promise. But like so many movies these days involving my two favorite creatures (vampires and shape-shifters, it went awry. What started out to be mildly interesting, then grew to be very interesting, was destroyed by oh-so-many references to pop culture, trying to appeal to pop culture. Some things are meant to be gory, not funny and down right brutal!I like Christina Ricci but this is one of her worst films to date! I recommend Dog Soldiers if you're in the market for an excellent werewolf movie."
2,Half baked attempt,"First of all any movie that has Scot Baio playing a cameo of himself is in deep trouble. Wes Craven is old and tired, like Stephen King, both ruled their respective world's, but now must move aside. The tank is empty, the imagination is dried up, and whatever the make is just a shadow of past works.Not any scary scenes here. Mostly just quick appearances that are supposed to make you jump (whee). The gay high school wrestler was the final straw, I finished the movie just to finish it. I don't understand why anyone would buy this. This is a movie that is watched once and quickly forgotten."
3,"""Teen Wolf"" + The OC + blood & gore = ""Cursed""","I can't imagine watching the PG-13 version. Who payed 9+ bucks to see that at the theatre?This movie is full of cliches: the one person who figures out what is going on and no one believes him/her (a la ""Silver Bullet""), the mysterious stranger who may or may not be a werewolf and the mandatory ""Surprise"" ending.But Cursed does have some redeeming values. The suprise ending is somewhat original and it does have some gory scenes in the unrated version (especially the scene in the beginning).Its worth a look."
1,In one word: Lame,"Tired cliches, the cheap ""shock"" scares with sudden noises or imagery, and nothing redeeming about it. Apparently the film studios are hurting for money and want to get horror movies out ASAP, otherwise I can't see why they would make such trash. This film could have been a lot better, a rehash of the teenage werewolf tale, but it fails miserably. Seems they ran short on the budget at the end, as we didn't even get a fully transformed werewolf from any of them. Sad, sad, sad. Skip it by all means. If you must see it, rent it, buying it would be a complete waste."
2,Not scary! Sorry Wes.,"A brother and sister team are biten by a werewolf that then stalks them. I'm usually a fan of Wes Craven, but he missed by a mile on this one.This is a hugely flawed story. The brother and sister are biten by a werewolf, but still run when it shows up. Why? What are they afraid of, aren't they already cursed?Then there is the flaw of the werewolf that made them wanting to destroy them? Why did he turn them to werewolves in the first place if he just wanted to kill them? Didn't he make killing them harder by turning them into something supernatual? He could have just killed them in the beginning.Also, Craven strays from the werewolf legend by making the werewolves retain their control and ability to reason when morphed into full werewolf. It would be scarier to make the werewolves into out of control creatures that mindlessly kill without reason.There were a couple attempts at humor that did not help the story and came across as cheesy. Not what I want in a werewolf flick."
4,Just Fun.,"!Heather's Teenage Son!Yeah. This movie was a great way to blow time off in the theater, and anyone who is a fan of Wes Craven or horror-comedies will get a kick out of this film. It's not gonna be a classic like Nightmare On Elm Street or The Hills Have Eyes, but it's still fun...and the CGI werewolves are actually good! There is one scene that has some bad CGI, and that's the dog. And this movie is far from perfect. You can tell what scenes were reshot sometimes, and which ones weren't. And you could even tell where they dubbed over profanity in one scene. So, I'm definately getting the Unrated version of this flick, where Shannon Elizabeth supposedly crawls on the ground to try to escape...and it's just the top half of her body. So, overall, this is a fun, campy little horror flick that I'd reccomend to those who like 80's horror.PS...GET THE UNRATED DVD! Not the PG13 one! ;)"
2,Cursed is right!,"What a letdown. Two great horror/comedy wits and a great cast add up to very little in this werewolf film. Poor Christina Ricci was probably just looking for a way to get her face back on screen while awaiting the fate of Prozac Nation. It's a terrible waste of a very talented young actress. Really bad misteps that could have been funny are the weirdness that is Scott Baio and Craig Kilborn here. FX are not even that good. Portia DiRossi is kind of a hoot in her tiny role - but just because its so weird. Maybe if they had cut a half hour or so, they could have had something a little better, because this fees like it runs on and on. Take a pass."
3,cursed,"Typical bad sci-fi movie. I loved it. Not going to win for it's plot, but at least it has one. Acting is not stellar but the story is entertaining and enjoyable."
2,Not even a bit scary,"Cursed is not even slightly scary. This movie is about 2 siblings that are looking for the werewolf that bit them. The movie is full of CGIs that look like the came straight out of Scooby Doo (the movie). It's just bad, not even a bit entertaining. This is not the kind of movie I expect from Wes Craven. Scooby Doo was scarier than this."
3,Cursed,"Reasonably entertaining movie about two teens being bitten by a werewolve and going through denial, then discovery, and then acceptance. Overall although no particular surprises, I found it engaging enough to stick with it till the end. If you enjoy vampire and werewolve movies you will probably find it worth at least a rental. It has a decent mix of horror with a little comedy that adds to the experience. The acting and directing is decent and the sets and camera work are good. If you enjoyed this catch ""Scary Movie"", ""Arachnophobia"" and ""The Frighteners"". - C. Luster"
3,More funny then scary,"This wasnt scary at all, at times i was laughing so hard my eyes were watering, the only reason i'm giving this a 3 is because i thought it was hilarious, even tho it was entended on being scary... I recomend this movie to see how bad and poorly made it is, and to see how funny this movie was. You'll enjoy the comedy!"
2,OK WEREWOLF ENTRY! WORTH 2 1/2 STARS AND A LOOK!,"This is not a classic by any means,but I thought it had enough going for it to warrant a ""worth watching"" review. The story seems to teeter between serious and humor and that is it's major downfall. The cast does what is can with the material given to them. The DVD transfer looks good and worth checking out."
3,Cursed ? probably by the studio.,"This film has all the ingredients, good director, cast and budget. But what it also has is a studio that seems to think the lower the classification, the bigger the demographic, the more profits you get. So they've removed all the nasty bits. Problem is it doesn't work, what you end up with is a profoundly un-horrific horror film, that while neatly produced is fundamentally un-scary and that totally defeats the point turning off potential audiences.Until the studios stop running scared of adult ratings on their products, this is what we are likely to have to put up with, tame underachieving products that are the cinematic equivalent of candyfloss (Cotton candy to you folks). If you want wolves with a bit of genuine bite to them get Dog Soldiers"
4,"It'd be better perhaps, if the plot was set in New Orleans","I'm shallow on the topic of werewolves, but I thought: considering and comparing the background of L.A. and New Orleans, New Orleans would be a more interesting background for werewolves.But anyway, 4 stars cause in my shallow opinion, ""Cursed"" is way, much better than ""Dracula 2000"" and its two sequences. ;)""Cursed"" got a nicer pot and detailed settings (the pentagon LA skyline at the beginning), and I must say every scene shown was needed. A rather twisted ending though...somewhat weird, but nice enough.Anyway, ""Cursed"" is worth being recommended."
3,CURSING,not entirely bad...not that good either..the movie has its moments (1 or 2) bad acting..characters..the script..wes craven gotta give up on these teenie horror movies
1,NOT Wes Craven's fault (it's Harvey's),"This film was taken from Wes Craven by the Weinsten brothers at Mirimax. Harvey has a long history of chopping up films because he doesn't like them or they don't test well . It was reshot and severely edited by Harvey and bares little resemblence to the film Wes shot. Let's hope now that Mirimax is out of the Weinstein brothers control, all the directors who had their films ruined can go back and have a proper DVD made of them (It's no coincidence that Mirimax, while the Weinsten's were there, never released any director's cuts of their films. Heaven forbid that any directors get to edit their own films)."
2,A good movie but not a good scary movie,If you have nothing to do and you need something to watch then this is the movie to turn on but if you need a movie for you and your friends to watch on Halloween or just to get a good scream or two then don't even bother with this. The story is very common you know a werewolf is running around and killing people but in this the mystery is who is the werewolf. They actually do a great job of hiding who the killer is. The special effects are good the acting is well done but the movie just isn't scary at all. There are a few scenes that give you a jump but that's it. So do yourself a favor and watch it on cable leave the DVD alone.
2,Buffy the Werewolf,"This movie had some moments that worked really well, but most of it feels like Teen-Wolf-meets-Wednesday (from the Addams' family, not the day of the week)/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer. The potential was there, but the story falls flat on its face - very predictable and too ""Buffy."" I was also disappointed with Christina Ricci's performance. Christina, Christina, Christina - whining does not equate acting. I'm beginning to think she has more an act than accomplishing any acting, which is a shame since I do believe she has talent, and certainly doesn't need to be following in the footsteps of Sarah Michelle Gellar.An OK movie that will have you jumping with fright out of your seat."
2,Another Werewolf movie that could have been better but,"then again what did you expect with the 50th or Werewolfmovie ever made? Originality? A plot? Twists?Comeon people you've seen it all so stop complaining as ifyou could have done a better movie or that this moviewasn't any different. Of course it wasn't just likemany Vampire/Mummy movies.It was great though in terms of the acting by ChristinaRicci, and others. Special effects were a mix bag, somelonger and more in depth transformations would have beengreat, but for what we get, it's good.The spooks and thrills were there, I give Wes and the writerscredit for at least giving some good thrills here. It's nota total flop, nor is it a total winner. However if you're lookingfor a movie to waste away time with and see some ok Werewolfgore, and effects, ""Cursed"" is the movie for you."
2,UGH! BAD!,"I don't know what Wes Craven was thinking when he took the helm of this horrible movie. Basically, in this movie you find two siblings(a brother and sister) who lost their parents and the older sister tries as hard as she could to take care of her younger brother. When suddenly they chance upon a werewolf who is in the process of killing a person and they happen to get scratched. For the next 50 to 60 minutes we find that these siblings trying to gain back their humanity. WHile in the process trying to figure out who the werewolf strain goes back to. And who are the ones to trust.However, in reality this movie is horribly edited, acted, and almost to campy to be called a horror film. It is more a movie that leaves you wanting to see an actual WereWolf film than not.If you want to watch a recently made, GREAT werewolf movie I suggest watching a little known film called GINGER SNAPS."
2,Oh dear.,"Christina Ricci was soley what possessed me to see this movie.In short, even her presence was not enough to save this badly edited increasingly corny peice of crap. The movie started out fun, and had a few scares, but 20 minutes into it, it took a nose dive. This really needed to be rated R so that cool gore effects could've added SOMETHING to the movie."
2,What has Wes Craven DONE?!,"This movie tries SO hard to be scary, and a good thriller, but its just NOT - i mean dont get me wrong, it is a watchable movie, but its more of a dark comedy with gorey touches every once and a while, but other than that it failed as a horror movie! How could Wes Craven do this? After such hits such as: The scream trilogoy, the dracula movies, people under the stairs, this was just a complete let down. Since this in America, the land where movies are constantly butchered, I haven't seen the R rated version yet, so I'm hoping that that version will be a LITTLE better than this PG-13 version!"
1,horrible...warewolf movies are NOT cool anymore.,"Ok...anyone who liked this movie is clearly under the age of 13. This movie was NOT scary, NOT entertaining and had really stupid puns. Ms.Ricci cant act worth a dime, and the kid that plays her bro in the movie, I have never seen act anywhere else but he acts a lot better than her. Too bad it was for such a stupid movie. I cant stress enough how bad this movie sucked. IT WAS HORRIBLE. Not even worth renting. But they got my $8.50. I was a sucker :("
4,Not average,"While this definately isn't a normal werewolf movie,(as pointed out in earlier ratings, these werewolves don't act like your normal werewolves), it does have a lot of good parts, such as the jocks getting beat up, the bad guy being bad girl and bad guy, the annoying boss getting it in the end, (and talk about how), as well as the fairy tale ending where they (almost) all walk off into the moonlight. Can't say much more than that without ruining the movie, but good enough to watch would cover it pretty well."
2,Two things stopped this from being a 4 star,"I bought the PG-13 version before I saw the R rared version. Bad Move.MISTAKE 1: Buying Cursed as pg-13. The R Version editing is far superior than the PG-13. The special effects is 5 fold. Don't get PG-13 - big , big, mistake. If your craven for a Craven this R version is a must.Mistake 2: Christina Ricci. I'd rather have a can of Tomato Juice than her in this movie. It seemed everyone was enjoying the script except for Christina Ricci.Summary: Buy the R Version and mentally substitute Christina Ricci for a can of Tomato Juice. You'll see a good movie."
1,Don't watch it....you will waste your time,"This movie is a prime example of what is wrong with most of the horror movies being made today. Take a bunch of 'pretty' young actors/actresses,a weak script,bad acting,even weaker special effects,some gore and you have the makings of a really bad film.This one is no different from the vast load of 'teen' movies that studios are trying to pass off as horror films these days.This is why I mostly only watch horror movies that were made before 1980. When are directors and movie studios going to realise that not every horror fan is an angst filled teen?"
2,Cursed is right...,"if you watched this movie. A werewolf is on the loose in Los Angeles and attacks siblings Ellie (Ricci) and Jimmy (Eisenberg). They are now ""cursed"" and the only way to break it is to kill the person who started everything. This movie did not have a lot of thrills in it and they tried a little humor as well, which did not work too well if you ask me. Sadly, I would have to say pass on this movie."
2,When will Hollywood take a hint and stop these kinds of movies....,I saw this movie in the store and instantly knew that buying it would be a mistake. Well i did and to my horror it turned out to be just another cheesy teen werewolf movie. Considering it came with Wes Craven's name on it i was hoping but this is by far the worst movie of his that i have ever seen.
5,Good Movie,"If you like werewolf movies, this is so the right sort of thing. It had some great points, a different twist on the classic werewolf movie, and other great points. Plus, if you are like me and have something for homoerotic goodness, there is a wrestling scene, a gay guy, a gay guy IN a wrestling scene, and then later a gay guy trying to kiss the other guy in the wrestling scene."
4,Aparently there is another version on blu ray,"the Alliance version is barebones, no extras, widescreen 16:9(2.40.1) 1080p 1 hr37 min includes DTS and dolby 5.1 diffrent ratio than the Echo Bridge halloween version it has a 2 sided cover one side is French version the other American, french version says Malefice above the cover pict has a canadian film rating of 14A im guesing its the canadian version of the unrated its 2 min shorter than the demension unrated dvd same length as the Echo Bridge version diffrent screen ratio"
4,Good...but i'd rather watch the unrated version,"This was an enjoyable and original horror flick. One things for sure, i would not say that this is one of Christina Ricci's worst films,...in fact, she's one of the only reasons i attempted to see it. Most of the acting is descent, as well as the special effects. Still, in some shots, the Wearwolf looked rediculousley fake, and it was so stupid it was funny when the wearwolf stuck her middle finger out in protest!!! Anyway, i watched the making of the film, and saw many parts that did not make it into the PG-13 version. Most of them were somewhat gruesome, but hey, this is a Wes Craven movie. So in the end, i would recomend CURSED for all horror fans, but i've given it only 4 stars because i think the unrated version would satisfy viewers more."
1,One of Wes Cravens Worst,"TERRIBLE!!! This movie is one of the most dumbist movies of all time. The storyline stunk, the acting was terrible. It was also unrealistic. It was a complete waste of my time. I lost two hours off my life for that movie. If I could give it zero, I would. See it, if you dare."
3,Was on ok movie,This movie has its funny parts. And then it has its pretty lame parts. All in all i would give it a 2 1/2 star vote. If you want to be bored then watch this movie. if not then dont watch it.
3,Not bad,"You all are being way to hard on this movie its exactly what you expect if not better typical horror movie with a crazy animated wolf or ""the beast"" lol but if you love horror films this wont be bad at all Wes Craven is still the man"
1,"AWFUL,,AWFUL, AND AGAIN.AWFUL!!","DAMN!!This movie sucked...crappie fake CGI and werewolf, Bad acting and story, what a waste the time, this movie was more lame comedy then scary, with werewolf gives a finger and says liar?/????? WTF?? U know, I really liked Wes craven back in 70s and 80s movies, Now these days getting really silly and stupid and not scary at all. These days he's movies is good to flush down the toilet., Did he really think that, he would make a block buster or make money over this trash??/ . Someone tell these directors, Beast, monster, gullies & Godzilla, crap, don't make people scare anymore, this is not 30s and 40s..This IS millennium years, People scare of reality horror and stories could or can happen, NOT B.S and scrip like this.. This movie really sucked. Is one of the worst movies I ever saw, and he made!!."
3,A Hollywood flop,Cursed is a horrible movie. It's predictable (and I mean really really predictable.) It's also anything but scary. Stay away from this Craven flop.
1,AWESOME!!! (Yeah right this movie sucked),"It really did im sorry, For all those wanting to see this movie, Im a big horror film buff myself and this movie is just plain silly, not scary with chessy lines and bad werewolfs, But one good thing about it is that, Its so bad, It's good! Kind of like those happy acidents, Movies that dont plan on being funny but there just hillarious! So if you want something funny, get this! You wont be dissapointed"
3,"Pull that stick out of your butt, people","People are being a little harsh on Wes Craven's werewolf flick. I guess people don't know the meaning of ""tongue in cheek."" This movie is one of the funnest movies I've seen in a while, while it lacks originality, and comes up a bit short in the scares department, it's an entertaining horror/satire in the vein of Scream, and in the EXACT tone of Wes Craven's ""Vampire in Brooklyn."" It is hefty with the gore and satire/wit. My guess is people assume the movie's supposed to be a straight-forward horror film, and are dissapointed coming to the conlcusion that it's a stupid and corny movie. If you want hard-core or straight-forward scares from Wes Craven, go see Red Eye, or rent A Nightmare on Elms Street, or Last House on the Left. This film is just pure entertainment with a great cast."
2,Doesn't deliver the goods,Ricci is wasted in this film.It's not scary at all but is watchable because it is fairly stylishly done.At the end though you won't really want to do repeated watchings.
2,WES CRAVEN'S BEST IN A WHILE- FAIRLY DECENT AND WATCHABLE,"In Los Angeles, an estranged brother and sister (Christina Ricci and Kevin Foley) must deal with the recent loss of their parents. But one dark night a car accident changes their lives after a life-altering attack, by a vicious werewolf. Directors Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson incorporate their hip, edgy style and put their unique signature on this classic tale of Lycenthropes running amok. Snappy one liners are at times amusing. Not that bad of a watch."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"Cursed a movie that I wanted to see so bad disappointed me highly. Not only was it fake as heck it was just not scary and the plot was lacking in order to try and scare you. It is by far one of the worst scary movies I have seen. It ranks up there with Boogeyman, just not worth the time you waste watching it or the money you waste renting or going to the movies. I like the actors in the movies but not the acting. And they hype up characters to make you think it is them but then the characters just seem to disappear in the first half of the movie so it is extremely easy to guess who the real werewolves are. Just not my type of scary movie especially from the creators of some of the best scary movies. Just save your money!"
2,...not bad....not great.....,"....i liked christina ricci,as well as the rest of the cast....the big problem here is the cgi werewolf effects....in 1980 they made ""THE HOWLING""....the effects were done by rob bottin....i have NEVER seen a werewolf movie IMPROVE on those effects!!!...and this was before they used cgi effects!...""DOG SOLDERS"" came close,and is excellent as well....the werewolf in this movie at times looked good,but other times looked fake...overall it was a fun ""B"" movie.....it could have been better..."
2,"Box office is slumping, wonder why?","Hey now, with movies like this (not to mention a zillion stupid remakes) it's easy to see why Hollywood is taking it in the shorts for earning money. Even the unrated version is pretty tame and lame. I did enjoy the werewolves walking on their hind legs and bouncing across cars in the parking garage scene, and the scene where Christina Ricci draws out the werewolf towards the end with insults (and ends up getting the finger for her trouble) was amusing, but overall this is formulaic and bland and not really worth anyone's time. Wes Craven's name on a movie is no longer any reason to see it."
3,Starts off on the right track...,"Saw this movie a couple of nights ago at a sneak preview.It starts off on the right track, with jump in your seat scenes.Some gory blood and guts type of stuff, but not overwhelming. As the movie goes on, it gets more predictable. Some good effects, some scenes to laugh at. As the movie should have been building near the end, it falls a bit flat and ends too suddenly/easily. The acting/effects were a bit better than I expected."
1,Ridiculous and lame!,"""Cursed"" is the most pathetic werewolf movie I've seen since ""An American Werewolf in Paris"". The acting is terrible, directing is poor (Shame on you Mr. Craven) and the storyline is largely uncompelling. The werewolves look ridiculous and the whole movie really comes off as a total joke to a sophisticated adult horror movie audience. This movie seems to cater to the teens and early 20s people who might think something like this is ""cool"", but if you're looking for a scary movie, don't look for ""Cursed"". Well, at least it's not as bad as ""An American Werewolf in Paris"", but that sure as hell isn't saying much."
1,Very Lame,"Im a big fan of Wes Craven but this is just crap, he went from that masterpiece of Nightmare on Elm St to this Masterpiece of crap? no not a movie that I liked, very stupid and lameOverall:1.5......Horrible"
1,Disappointing,"Lackluster werewolf film does not deliver the goods in the terror department and makes fools out of the people who paid to see it. Wes Craven is a better director than this but you don't get that by watching this movie, which in fact feels like it should have gone direct to Dvd. I don't know what happen in postproduction but as it stands right now, it's a complete mess."
1,Horrible,"Worst movie I ever seen, avoid watching at all costs. It tries to grab your attention, then turns the plot into a complete joke and turns it into a car crash of a movie. Dont spend a dime on this piece of garbage."
3,Alright Movie,"This movie is good, but some stuff ruins the legend of the werewolves that we all grown up with. Some of the themes are stupid and others could better. And some of the acting is horrible. But on a rainy day this is a good movie to watch and make fun of it. That what it does makes fun of the werewolf legend and past films. Wes Craven's direction is good but this is my least favorite of his movies. So watch if you want. I enjoyed it but I think it could be better. Alot better. Can't wait for Red Eye though. It looks like classic Craven and will be fun."
4,Great!,"I borrowed this game from a friend and let me tell you, it's the best game. I gave it 4 stars because it could have been better in some parts, but hey, I'm not complaining."
5,Best Game Ever!,"Ok, this is the most fun game I have ever played!Alot of people complained because the game wasn't an actual karaoke game and you didn't get to sing, but WHO CARES? the puzzle-like style to the game instead of singing is still fun!The Competition Mode was pretty easy I'll admit, and I beat it on EASY the first try, but it's alot of fun trying new songs and new clothes...I definately recommend trying all levels of Difficulty, I'm on the HARD level now.As for glitches...there are some, such as time delays between singing, cheering, the judges comments, etc. and some of the transitions get annoying...BUT...it does not take anything away from the game and you will eventually just get used to it!The singing is good, the graphics are decent, the sound is nice, and the game is just awesome!The game is ALOT of fun! GREAT game for an American Idol fan!I hope they make a 2nd version!"
2,Disappointing,"This game leads you to believe you can do ""karoke"" with it. However, your ""voice"" is controller operated. I guess you would have to be an ""american idol"" follower to appreciate this game. We bought it because my daughter loved karaoke revolution and the dance mat games. We're trading it in..."
1,Pathetically stupid,"I can't believe that a video game based on a show where people sing isn't centered around a mic and players singing. If I wanted to test my eye hand coordination, I'd play a real video game.I bought this trash for my kids after having Karaoke Revolution for a couple of months. They played it for five minutes and decided they'd had enough. What a waste of money.If you want a game that judges you on your ability to SING, (you know like the real American Idol) get Karoake Revolution."
2,American Idol,"In this so-called karaoke game, you press controller buttons while you're supposed to sing. But the game really just depends on your controller, and doesn't grade your singing... The only advantage is this game has the music and virtual Simon, Paula, etc and a few live clips with Ryan."
5,I love this game!,"I think this game is fantastic - it is a must for any American Idol fan, but I have loads of friends who don't watch the show who are hooked too!! :)It's great fun for you to play by yourself or in a group of people and Simon is just as scary in the game as on the show (although he's been quite nice to me!!)Great job!!"
1,amazon is better,on dvdspree.com its $200 but on amazon its like only $30. i give Dvdspree.com a 1. but amazon.com for $30 thats better than $200. so i give that a 5. but this revioew is for dvd spree. save $5 or so here thats cool you can buy 2 instead of 3.
1,bad in every sense of the word,"This is just a flat out horrible game. When I first heard American Idol would be making its debut as a video game, I immediately knew it would be a horrible idea, and it was. Bad bad bad.The fact that the game puts too much thought and effort into selecting a hairstyle and dressing up your teenage Idol character just makes the game stink even more. As for the actual singing part, well, pressing buttons on the controller JUST the right way will help you stay in tune with the musical notes you hear. This isn't any fun, though. Avoid."
1,american idol good show bad game,yo i love american idol i am watching it right now the new season rox. scooter girl is funny lol!But this game is not good its not funny. i love tha music on it. It has kelly clarkson my favorite singer. I wish there were more ruben or clay songs. there should be 3 more kell clarkson hot songs. But this game is not cool. Its also on gameboy advance maybe that rox.
1,dumb game,"this is the stupidest game i have ever played. do not buy this game if u do then you r very dumb, really it is a waste of time. and also when it is time for america to vote, they just put anybody's name. even if you were the best. and if u sounded awesome, they say no or something. they give you a small selection of songs to choose from. it is either like one or none. i think i wasted my money. i think you should like, sing into a mic, and they start from there. that would be better than this dumb game is now. i mean cmon, pressing buttons?! a 4 year old could do that. let alone a 13 year old!!! don't buy this. if you were smart, you wouldn't buy it~!!!(...)"
1,Great for small children who love lousy music,"If you have a four year old that has, for some reason, an affinity for prefab pop music, then this might be the game for you. For the rest of us, this is a waste of money and time. Wow, you get to choose the costumes and the hairstyles! That is hardly what I call gameplay. As for the gameplay itself --- if you know the difference between a triangle, circle, etc. then you are 90% percent of the way there. Again, your preschool tots might find this a little daunting, but they will be the only ones. One reviewer compared this to the old game SIMON, but that game emphasized good memory skills above everything else and is in fact still more challenging than this pre-fab nonsense. Save your money and your time & avoid this boring, unchallenging garbage."
1,Positively Awful Game,"I pulled this game out and attempted to play it. I hadn't played it since I purchased it a few years ago and couldn't remember why. Now I do. What a dreadful game. When I purchased it, I remembering thinking that it was karaoke game and it is not. The controller determines if you are on key or not. This was not fun to me. I will be taking a few games for trade-in tomorrow and this will be one of them."
2,Bad Microphone.....Great Game--<<Kids Review>>--,Me and my friend loved this game and we played all the time...we only had the one microphone(that came with the game). And then we stopped playing. And about a week later we tried playing it again and the microphone was all messed up... it would miss like half the notes like it was turning on and off.AWESOME game i think i just got a bad mic.
4,great game,My son loves this game. You can pick the songs you want to sing and then sing them as good or as bad as you want. It's fun to make them sing off key so their reviews are bad. This is a great kids game.
4,Fantastic,"I just got this game as sort of a late birthday gift (my birthday is Jan 3) but is fantastic. It is tons of fun to design your own guy and win competitions. However, the only reason its not getting 5 is because there were some glitches in graphics and its not like you actually sing (unless you have a mic). If you have a mic you can do karaoke mode where YOU actually sing, but other than that you press buttons to keep your singer in tune.My ratings: (1-10)Graphics:7Sound:10Creativity:9Fun:8Peace and go to www.lp.org"
4,Good game!,"I really like and enjoy this game! It's a really fun game and it was definately worth the purchase. The only thing I would change, is to maybe make it more challenging, and add in other activities. I am hooked on this game."
2,Awful,"This game stinks. It was ""a complete and utter disaster"", as Simon would say. DO NOT waste your money on this game. You don't even get to sing. YOou just push buttons. pointless. i would go with the american idol kareoke revolution.With kareoke revolution, you actually sing into a mic."
2,Unrealistic,"I bought this game on a drunken lark (after consuming several adult bevvies after an evening nuddling with the noopsies at Lucky's Tavern) and I've played it more than a few times since. Bessie (my baboonish (and tone-deaf) bride) looooves the game since it ridiculously determines singing skill on how quickly you can click some arrows (and Bessie is a very quick click). The boorish baboon pretty much bested Hopperrooo on every occasion--even though I am the much finer singer and overall superior talent. No matter, the game is fun, the Idol judges are true to form (Simon a cad, Randy a dawg, and Paula a simpering numskull), and after a six-pack of slooshies I didn't much care whether I won or lost. Recommended for fun, but not reality."
3,))<>((,"There are a number of cool scenes - such as the one with the goldfish, or the curator playing the late night DVD, or the bench meeting between the curator and the little kid - and the leading actress is exquisite. Unfortunately, this is overshadowed by the general sulleness and moroseness that seep into every corner of the movie. Most of the actors, especally the kids, look perpetually asphyxiated.It seems to me the director was paralyzed by her own sensitivity.an indie allright. a breath of fresh air that lacked oxygen."
1,Self-indulgent pseudo-intellectual twaddle.,"I believed all the hype, enthusiastically sat down to watch it and was bored to tears. Tries desperately to be quirky and cute but ends up being irritating and nauseating."
3,Celebration of Your Uncomfort,"Child-molesting and immolation have never felt so awkward... Also called, ""Me and You and Some Other Freaks"", because not that being weird is bad(our motto in Austin is to ""Keep Austin Weird"" and now have a musical bearing that name), but the characters in the film skate dangerously on an an unhealthy line of sanity. They make the characters in Ghost World seem normal. July's acting really carries the film, and I was shocked at the creative and mystical ending. The score, other shot compositions, and actors all play out well to this effect. This movie wants to be your redheaded stepchild and succeeds when it's not being too blunt with its quirkiness."
1,Art for art's sake = bad cinema,"This is a pretentious and disturbing film. I watched it based on the good reviews it had received, and I regret having done so. I found the innuendoes of underage sex and pedophilia made for uncomfortable viewing. There isn't much story to speak of (isolation in the digital age, apparently) - which doesn't really matter if you enjoy art for art's sake; if you don't, stay clear of this one."
1,What a rip off!,"I really wander sometimes how far off some have to be to see anything good in a movie like this one. Even more when they suggest that it will be about meaningfulness... This is the kind of movie that comes from someone that when to school for to long and got cut up in the Art theory without any connection to anything touching or moving. To top it off, what a shame, to involve many children in it and give them very low script to say. For example, pooh in my but and I'll pooh in yours and then I'll pooh it back in yours, always the same pooh forever. Wow, and all the other children involve will show this movie to there friends.I really don't suggest it."
1,Miranda July tries to hard to be artistsic and ends up being anything but,This movie is a classic example of an indie film trying too hard to be original and artistic. Nothing makes this movie unique to other better told narratives except for the fact that the characters are boring and the jokes only mildly amusing. The movie lacks a coherent message instead hiding behind the fact that is a more abstract piece of work.There is one scene that makes the movie worth seeing and redeemable however in which the two children have an online conversation with an older cyber sexer. This was one of the funnier scenes I've seen in a long time.
4,a feel-good indie sensation,"A quirky little film with amazingly flashed out characters. The script is marvelous and the characters are spectacular. Miranda July is a remarkably talented person - from her writing to her directing to her poignant portrayal in this film. If you like indie films, I highly recommend this movie."
4,Unpredictable and charming,"Be warned: it's not kid-appropriate, there are some disturbing sexual elements. But for adults, it's a disarming and original fable of the risks of love and the rewards of taking chances."
2,don't bother,"I watched this film because it earned awards at five film festivals, including Cannes and Sundance, but save your time and money--it's horrible. The dialogue is dreadful, the plot unbelievable, the multiple sub-plots distracting, and the teenage sex ridiculous if not perverse. So, the experts are wrong, including Roger Ebert who gave this film 4 of 4 stars. Richard is separating from his wife Pam and works at a shoe store. He meets Christine, a starving artist who drives a taxi for the elderly, as if we should care. I guess the film revolves around the single line of a senior citizen to the effect, ""Your whole life could be better, starting right now."" Yes, especially if you avoid this film."
5,Great Movie!!!,"The movie was simply wonderful and I reccommend that you go and see it, I saw it 3 times; and then came to the conclusion at the rate I was paying to see the movie I could just wait and purchase the movie and watch it all the time.It was a pefectly told story of how some random people were all interconnected.And I suggest checking out the score for this movie, simply wonderful."
3,Close But Not Quite,"I'm happy to see so many awards and nominations on a film that tried so hard to be relevant, explore the meanings or lack thereof in our lives, etc. It's funny, intelligent, quirky, memorable, moving, with striking visuals in points.Something's not quite working here, unfortunately, but Miranda June is probably a moviemaker we should all be keeping an eye on.Take a look at the reviews. See the range? That's what you want. If everybody thinks something is ""nice,"" it's doomed. You want people to feel something, because if it can inspire one-star reviews then it can also inspire five-star reviews. For me, it didn't quite work, hence my middle-of-the-road bit, but I feel an author trying to write something meaningful, so I respect that."
1,Two hours I'm never getting back,"I completely agree with prior comments regarding, most importantly, child abuse, and also pretension. It was only after ten minutes of watching this that I realized I had seen it once before, and that's because nothing actually happens.I'd like to add another dimension to previous comments; Miranda July, like many feminists, clearly hates women. The female characters in this film are universally pathetic victims, further the two women with the greatest power in the film (the elderly women who anticipates her own death, and the divorcee) are treated with hostility by Ms. July.Clearly if you're not as dopey as Miranda July, you just don't seem to get the reality of it all. And, surely this film will become the primary citation for the lunacy of deferring to film festivals for insight into film quality."
1,AWK!,"If you like indie film garbage writing, psychotic women, & let's face it, a trend towards child pornography... then this is your film! Funny? Possibly. Endearing. No. Creepy? Yes! The actors all did a wonderful job & that's the only thing that saves this movie. Watch something else."
1,Another film school project?,"While I have nothing against indie films (and normally actively seek them out), this is one of the genre that makes it hard for other indie films to reach a wider audience. It tries *really* hard to make its point, and all of the principal actors (at least the adults) seem like stereotypical, overly-motivated theater majors who are dying to see how emotional they can make their performances.I found it overall flat and overwrought, while my wife was so disturbed by some of the imagery (particularly the adolescent/child sex theme) that she didn't watch the whole thing. If you think this might be your cup of tea, I would definitely recommend a rental before you buy."
1,WORST. EVER.,"This movie was the second biggest waste of my life after ""I <3 Huckabees."" It came highly recommended by trusted friends and I honestly have no idea what they saw in this that I didn't. The ""quirky"" dialog was cliche and uninteresting as was the plot. The ""edgy"" parts were contrived and disgusting and for the most part unrealistic. I hated this movie."
2,100% indie cliche,"Me and You and Everyone we Know is a typical indie melodrama:Narrow emotional range. If the totality of humanity's emotional experience ranges from 1 to 10, indie melodramas violently resist leaving 5. Even in this movie's most violent scene, the participant is emotionally reticent. Martin Donovan's contribution to film.Children and Sex. What's a good indie melodrama without fantasies of pedophilia and copraphilia?Misunderstood artist. Ah yes, the misunderstood artist who cannot understand why people don't respect her! And her character is played by ... wait for it ... the film's director! Snap!Ok, so now I am getting a little snarky. I still can't help feeling that this is one of those ""art films"" that people don't really like, but they are afraid to admit it lest their friends think they are not cool."
3,";;;;....;;;;,,,,","This film reminded me quite a bit of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" without the spunk. Instead of relentless positivism, the characters in M&Y;&EWK; all display a hunger, a yearning for love and a paralyzing uncertainty born of repeated disappointment. The people are the same unpredictable and mildly-agreeable misfits as ""Sunshine"" but the film itself is considerably more somber.There are moments of unanticipated wonder in the film, and although somber the pace never drags so I found it quite easy to endure the overlaid sadness. Every actor is also quite good. The two little boys in particular are scene stealers in every frame they're in, and could've inhabited much larger parts. In the final analysis though the film has ""Sundance eccentricity"" in its genes as if written to a formula calculated to win awards in Utah."
5,Thermite Reaction,"Forget ""Reviewerspeak""! This film is so brilliant I fear only that it may be a one-shot deal for Miranda July. How COULD she follow this with anything so inspired! As dazzling and all-consuming as the thermite reaction I remember from chemistry class years ago!"
5,LISTEN TO THE PUBLIC!!!,"I don't know who owns the rights to this wonderful production, but considering all the other Rankin/Bass goodies available on DVD, why has Mouse On The Mayflower been ignored for release? It's ludacris! Release it!! For heaven's sake!! This production deserves at least the same repect that was given to lesser productions like ""Rudoloph's Shiny New Year"" or ""The Little Drummer Boy, Book II"", which were not half as good as Mouse On The Mayflower"". Most of us Baby Boomers grew up with this stuff. We got our baths & teeth brushed early so we could watch them before being scurried off to bed, and anxiously awaited repeats year after year. Did anyone else but me sit with a cassette recorder next to the TV speaker so they could record the show audio? LOL. I did. I loved the songs, and I'd listen to the tapes I made and play the visuals over and over in my head. God it was great being a kid! C'Mon Rankin/Bass! Bring this one back on DVD! It's a classic!"
3,the not so great olden days of cinema...,"I purchased this video for my daughter, remembering it fondly from my own elementary school days ( I think I watched on reel-to-reel...). I like the way it portrays the faith of the Pilgrim-Separatists, so often lacking in more modern recounts of the first Thanksgiving. I also love the theme song (Ma-a-a-yflower, Ma-a-a-yflower...)--it brings back warm childhood memories. What I hadn't realized as a child was just how embarrassingly racist movies back then could be. None of the antagonists have too much intelligence, but the Native-American Indian is portrayed to be especially idiotic. I'll still show the movie to my daughter this Thanksgiving and use it as a springboard for meaningful discussion, but I'm sure I'll be cringing along the way. It's just not as good as I thought I remembered."
1,Beware of racism,"I bought this video to show to my third graders, but after previewing it, I have decided it is very inappropriate. Although this video offers an interesting portrayal of the Mayflower voyage, some of the information is inaccurate. Of great concern is its treatment of Native Americans. Not only are the drawings stereotypically buffoonish, but the way they made them speak sounded like ""Tonto"" from the Lone Ranger. The Pilgrims even called them ""Red."" Yikes! The songs are very old-fashioned and boring, and are not really about the Mayflower; the lyrics are mostly about some love affair that is being kindled between two of the Pilgrims."
5,It doesn't get any better than this!,"Frank X. Tolbert's A Bowl of Red is the bible of chili. If you want to cook an authentic bowl of red read this book. If it isn't in this book, you don't need to know it.Plus, you get a grand essay on blackeyed peas (Now often called Texas Caviar), essays on The Gentleman from Odessa Stew and on Farkleberrys, and much more.And what more appropriate ending could you have than Bones Hooks' ""Chili Prayer""?"
1,not a cookbook,"i was looking for a cookbook, this was not one. the book is to much talk and not enough recipes. i was not impressed. i would not recommend."
3,A classic book about chili that runs a bit Texas-heavy,"A Bowl of Red serves as a history of chili, with a few other chapters added as filler (sort of like pinto beans are to a chili purist). According to Tolbert, chili is an American (not Mexican) dish which has its origins in the ""chili queen"" culture of late-19th century San Antonio. Texas chili is basically ground beef and chile peppers, with optional frijoles on the side; chilli chefs from other parts of the country, such as those who make the ""Greek chili"" served in Cincinnati and Springfield, will disagree. Tolbert also provides a few chili recipes, but not enough to make this a cookbook. Interesting book, but definitely a one-time read."
5,LOVE these vitamins!!!,"I used to take the GNC MegaWomen's Vitamins, but my Dr. recommended these vitamins instead.I've been taking them for the past couple of years, and they make me feel GREAT! They seem to have increased my energy, boosted my immune system and just make me feel better. I have ran out and I can tell a real difference when I am not taking them. My energy level drops, and I tend to get sick (especially with a child in pre-school).I am usually very sensitive to medication and won't usually take cold medicine because of how it makes me feel.These vitamins do nothing but good for me!"
2,"Can You Say ""Who Cares?""","Cliches abound in Two Guys. And even if they're cliches because they're true, that's no excuse to write a 300 plus page novel about them. Will is whiny, perfectly matched with an equally whiny wife. Joel is stuck on the past and seeing dead people, though much less entertainingly than the little boy in the Sixth Sense. Will gets his comeuppance and Joel, mightily effective in his infrequent sexual activity, gets a life. For his next novel, I would like to see James Kaplan aim his sardonic satirical talents at targets that are a little less broad than the side of a barn. And oh yeah, easy on the brand names next time, too."
3,ENJOYABLE BOOK ABOUT HOW YUPPIES GAUGE SUCCESS,"BOOK DEALS WITH MIDDLE-AGED MATERIALISTS AND AN OUT-OF-IT FAILURE AS THEY FACE THE MILLENIUM. A PLEASANT READ THAT DEPICTS MATERIALLY SUCCESSFUL BUT MORALLY SHALLOW PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THE WAY THEY LOOK, SHOWY CARS AND HOMES, AND SEXUAL GRATIFICATION."
1,"Gave it One, Because You Don't Have a Zero Grade.","All I have to say for the two guys is. Get a life! I must not have read the same book as the other reviewers. To me, it was about people I could not feel sorry for."
1,Tremendous potential with disastrous ending,"I purchased Two Guys From Verona with high expectations after reading the customer reviews. The first two thirds of the novel were an insightful examination of the lives of middle aged men in suburbia. The ending, however, was full of such bizarre coincidences that I completely forgot about what I had previously read. The title's allusion to Shakespeare was faulty. The Bard's tragic heroes at least had flaws; protagonist Will Weiss' destruction seemed totally undeserved. By the end I simply felt that I had wasted my time in reading the book."
4,A moving and funny chronicle of suburbia,"""Two Guys from Verona,"" (a title which, in addition to being a play on Shakespeare, is also a play on the name of a long-defunct New Jersey discount chain, Two Guys from Harrison) is a rueful, seriocomic take on what life does to suburban guys who, truth to tell, are just as clueless as adults as they were as teens. I, too, grew up in Cedar Grove, and Kaplan has the whole North Jersey thing down -- the local mobsters (and how one behaves around them), the views of the far-off city, the lust for polished floors and bigger houses, the local sub shop. I savored this book."
3,middle aged suburbanites cope with life,"Engaging contrast between ""well to do"" guy who seems to have it all, and his loser best friend. Will the tables get turned by the end of the story - what do you think? I anticipated most of the plot lines well ahead of time, but all in all, it wasn't an unpleasant read. The one thing that truly touched me about the story was how neglected the children were. The parents were totally absorbed with their own lives and so the children always ended up parked in front of the TV day and night - an all too accurate (and sad) commentary about life in our times I'm afraid."
5,Excellent Lockbox Oversized To Handle Several Keys !,This is a great lockbox product that has adequate room to securely hold several keys. Wish I had found this product years ago ! Promptly delivered by the Seller.
3,Great lock box,"Pros: all metal, easy combo change, good size inside (i used a keyring to hold the keys together, other wise they would fall out when opened), does what it needs too.Cons: if you mount it you have to punch out the mount holes in the back (different from the smaller ones), the rubber cover does not open easy so i left it off, and the rubber door holder seems not designed well (i wish it came off like the smaller units)Over all I would recommend it to someone else."
1,Got for a great price!! But then it broke after less than 5 months!,"The item is very solid and seems to be working very well. I find the combination a bit strange, in that you pick a series of numbers, but you cannot assess what order you enter them in (i.e. 12345 can be entered in in order to open the box). Other than that, it is a great item.***UPDATE****5 months later I am standing outside at 3 a.m. locked out of the property I bought the lock box for. The box won't open despite entering in the correct code. We finally had to enter the code, then hit the lever with a rock to pry the box open. Very frustrating that it broke so early on. My original review was *****, but that was when it worked...."
2,Bleah.,"In animated versions, Flash is depicted as a funny, intense, fast dude. This version, partly due to what they could do with video at the time, stinks. The plot is sketchy, the ""bad guys"" are poorly depicted and are definitely not appropriate for children and the acting is something out of a 5th grade play. Go watch Justice League or The Batman Season 5 to truly enjoy the Flash."
5,Worked great!,"Worked great to replace the broken drain on my Colman cooler. I do wish the spout were longer or threaded so I could attach a hose to it to drain the cooler without moving it but I understand the need to keep it as flush with cooler as possible. Easy to install, doesn't leak. What more is there to say?"
2,Does not fit all Coleman Coolers,"This drain assy does not fit the 4 or 5 day coolers. I'm not sure what cooler it fits but that isn't the drain I need. The stub on the drain is way to short for the bigger coolers so don't be suckered in when it says fits most coleman coolers. There was no physical defects to the drain, it just did not fit."
3,Average not great but will do the job.,"Slightly over-sized for the hole, but this is an older cooler and should do the job. The picture was exactly what mine looked like. No instructions on what order the parts go in. If you have and older cooler this will most likely work, but you will have to spend some time with it getting to fit in the hole."
2,An author over-promoted from obscurity.,"Readers will save themselves much unrewarding labor by disregarding both ""Precision and soul"" and, I daresay, the highly-touted ""Man Without Qualities,"" reading instead his first work ""Young Torless"" and the stories collected under ""Five Women."" Musil's derivative philosophical and psychological preoccupations invite inevitable comparisons with Nietzsche and Freud, both of whose work is vastly more durable and fruitful. Despite the powerfully bracing, if not occasionally repellent, astringency of his style, Musil's work subsequent to ""Five Women"" falls considerably short of his enormous and difficult ambitions which preoccupied his later labors; and, what's more, such a gaping failure of world-historical pretension tends to pollute enjoyments one might otherwise have had in reading it."

Read something by one whose enormous abilities are truly equal to ungodly ambitions -- read Proust."
5,Excellent book!,What a fabulous and exciting book. Each page proved to pull me deeper into the story. I just couldn't put it down! I recommend it to all.
1,Appears to be written by a follower of Ahmadiyya Sect,"Please do your own research of Ahmadiyya sect, but this book appears to be written and sold by this sect."
2,Only works with variflex- other brands are no good.,"The description does not say it anywhere but when you buy it you find it only works with the Variflex trampoline. When I called customer service they say it is useless with any other brand. It may work fine, I will never know because I can't use it on my 12' trampoline."
2,It does not fit right,"Variflex Trampoline Safety Enclosure - 12' I did not realize this net is not ""universal"" and it is not made for my trampoline. I was going to return it but my husband was determined to make it work. We used muffler clamps to attach the poles to our legs and had to use two old poles from our old enclosure so we would have enough poles. Only two poles lined up with the ties and six poles had to be tied with nylon wire ties. I am happy that it is safe, even though it looks a little funny."
4,An excellent reference book,An excellent but expensive reference book... But I did find one at a second hand bookstore for $15. What a deal!! No Paramedic student can afford not to have a copy.
4,n.p.g is FUNKY,"THIS ALBUM IS RARE FOR DEVOT PRINCE COLLECTOR I,M SO GLAD I OWN IT. THE TRACKS ARE VERY PRINCE JUST JAMMING AND HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH THE BAND. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR MORE COMMERCIAL PRINCE STUFF THIS IS NOT IT THOUGH YOU WOULDN'T HAVE FOUND YOURSELF HERE! BUY IT WHATEVER IT COST YOU!"
5,A must have for Laptop/Visor owners.,"This cable's perfect for syncing to your laptop while on the road. It's not too long, so it packs real well in my already crammed Powerbook carrying case. Especially for the price, it's indespensible for keeping your PDA & Laptop in sync while on extended road trips."
3,leak,"I think this is a great idea. BUT It leaked. I used it on the Goya nalgene stainless bottle. The mesh is fine enough to use for pine needle tea, and looks good enough for coffee. I set it in my GSR stainless cup. Swirl it around a while. Drink up. It stores nice between the lid, and bottle. That is worth it by its self since I use another bottle for water."
3,Leaves a bit to be desired,This item at first seemed like a great idea until I actually used it. The Percolator did not create a leak proof seal on my Nalgine bottle which let boiling hot water dribble out on me. It also became immediately noticeable that poring very hot water into a Nalgine bottle created a bottle that was too hot to hold or handle with your bare hands.
3,"Great idea, decent product, needs improvement","This product was apparently intended for use with the plastic 32oz Nalgene bottles only, because it will seal just fine on those if you tighten it, and the lids for them will seal on the H2Jo.However, I have the 38oz Nalgene stainless steel bottle and it doesn't seal at all on it. I had to add a couple 2 inch ID, 1/8 thick, O-rings from my local hardware store. One under the H2Jo and one above in order to get a seal.Also, I've read many times that the H2Jo won't seal or sometimes won't even fit on many of GSI's own bottles, so they obviously screwed up somewhere.The concept is fantastic, but the product needs improvement. I give 3 stars because I had to spend more money and take a trip to the hardware store to make this product usable.I say save your money, and buy Folgers Singles unless you don't mind instant coffee."
4,works as advertised,"Bought this months ago, and now that I've used it on a few camping trips I love it. I bought a Nalgene wide mouth bottle to go with it, and it's now the dedicated coffee bottle since the plastic retains the coffee flavor and anything you put in the bottle after tastes like coffee. You could probably get the taste out by cleaning the bottle with boiling water, but I've never bothered.No matter which method you use (the packaging explains 2 ways to use it) you WILL get some grounds in your coffee...If you're the type who camps and uses simple methods like this it probably won't bother you, I don't mind. The directions specify ""coarse ground"" coffee which I cannot find pre-ground, so I go to the supermarket that has a coffee grinder.All in all it has lived up to expectations and works as advertised.If no grounds ended up in the coffee I'd give it 5 stars."
3,"great for camping cofee, IF you use the right coffee","Its great, assuming you dont care about some coffee grounds making it into your drink or getting different coffee ground. works great, snap to clean.. i like it a lot ofor comforting on camping trips."
3,Threads don't match other GSI bottles.,"It makes great coffee, similar to French press with a bit of grit on the bottom. I use it by putting the grounds and hot water together in the bottle, then straining through the H2JO filter (cowboy coffee). It comes out perfect every time! My biggest problem with it, however, is that the threads on it don't work with newer GSI bottles. I've tried both theGlacier DuKJug Premium Backcountry Stainless Steel Water Bottle(which I love) and theInfinity DuKJug BPA-Free Backcountry Polypropylene Water Bottle... no go. It does, however, work with the old GSI H2GO bottle that I have (and hate). I have not tried it with Nalgene or other brand bottles, yet. This has seriously bummed me out and I considered returning my H2JOs and DukJugs, but I've yet to find a better coffee solution. I've tried writing GSI to find out if they are going to change the threads of the filter to match their new bottles (or vice versa), but they've never bothered to respond :("
5,Great overview,"Good view on a theory of protests and social Change, just make sure to read some of Dennis Chong's theory to have a balanced approach."
4,Familiar story elevated,"While clichÃ©d in basic story, and contrived in premise (back-up singer andoverall mess is fired from tour, ends up in same trailer park with daughtershe abandoned years ago to her mother-in-law, now is drawn slowlyinto wanting to reconnect), the execution raises it to a higher level, especially JudyDavis's great performance.Complex, abrasive, heartbreaking she makes the story come to life.I'd love to see a better copy, because a lot of reviews praise the cinematography, but in 4:3on vhs transfer, it's hard to appreciate that element.Also, it ends on an unfortunately false, forced beat,Full of interesting specifics and details, this quiet, muted story is lovely, if not amazing.I'd like to see it again, especially in a good, widescreen copy."
5,Best Cook Book Ever!!!,"This cookbook has some great recipes along with some cute stories, family traditions and rare recipes. I had this cook book a long time ago and had lost it when we moved. I needed a recipe from it for our traditional Christmas Breakfast. The seller (Pattie) went out of her way to overnight the book to me to make sure I had it before Christmas so I could make our families favorite Crepe's.Thanks Pattie!! You made our Christmas complete this year!!!!"
1,"Dull and Out of Tune, Just as Vol 1","I would like to say that this recording was an improvement over Volume 1, which I found to be rather annoyingly out of tune (Ms. See) and hideously dull (all except Ms. Springfels). I see that the price on this set just keeps dropping and dropping, probably soon to be remaindered altogether. These are very significant works that deserve a much more invigorating and imaginative treatment than they are given here."
5,Supreme Bud Powell. From his final years.,"This legendary (but previously long out of print) live date, universally coveted by collectors, is proof that even in his later years, Bud Powell was the greatest pianist on earth. Here, he is inspired, brilliant, fresh, lighting fast, and his solos are long, bursting with ideas. This is prime Bud Powell, among the finest recorded."
3,Decent,"If you are a true Bud Powell Fan i suggest you buy this CD. The sound quality isn't the best but it's not as bad as some reviewers make it out to be. I wouldn't buy this album if your intention is to use it for transcrpitions or any kind of academic purpose. But if you just want to listen to Bud play a bunch of really good Bebop standards it's a really good album to get. Also ""How High the Moon/Ornithology"" is brilliant probably my favorite song on the album next to ""All God's Children"". It was my first Bud Powell album and i now have the Scene Changes and Time Waits and this album has yet to lose its speciality in my eyes. Also Chick Corea's linear notes are pretty cool."
3,It's cheaper at GlobetrekkerTV.com,Just want to let all interested parties know that you can get this video from GlobetrekkerTV.com for only $17.95 + shipping & handling. Much cheaper than $39 for a used one!
2,not really good,"i would like for it to distribute the load on my back but i feel that it makes me feel like it puts all or most of the pressure in two points in my upper back and lower back, which strains my middle back.the straps a little bit narrow and were starting to come off after only 2 months of use, without putting in it anything heavier than clothes.paid $7 to a tailor to fix it.im content w it i guess, but was disappointed about the straps, so i rated 2 stars.i only have had it for 3 months now, lets see how it goes for the next year."
4,Fresh? Hardly...! But fun anyway...!!,The recordings are actually between (my guess) 28 and 32 years old. The strength of Santana is that they still sound fresh today.... Another one of these obscurities that are required material for the devotees and may sound less pleasing to others.....
4,"Scarce, Valuable","Gluck's ""The Marriage of Hercules and Hebe"" is the sort of chamber style opera, written on the occasion of a royal aristocratic wedding, with which Gluck lovers should be familiar. For those who cherish the relatively modest number of Gluck's works this is a good straw to grasp at and be happy. Berlin Classics does an extraordinary job of rescuing this performance from the mid 60's and making it sound both natural and as if it could have been recorded yesterday; the same difficult magic that they perform on other recordings."
3,"4 stars for 3 new songs, 2 stars for the remakes. not bad.","This is an interesting little album that's sold only in Family Christian Bookstores. They take 7 of their previous songs and remake them. Some are quite nice, some weren't my favorite. The three new songs were pretty good, if not a bit short like many of their songs. Basically the remakes weren't really necessary because their originals were good-great, but if you can find this cheap at the Family Christian Bookstore, pick it up. This is mainly for hardcore fans. For beginningers pick up their greatest hits on ""The Late Great PFR."""
1,Worst Album I've Ever Bought,"I've bought a lot of albums over the years, including every one of PFR's albums. This represents the worst album I've ever purchased. Since I am a PFR fan, and actually wanted to like this album, the album may even be worse than I think it is. Nevertheless, it is a shame that PFR would put out this album."
3,Is any sick among you?,Not quite what I expected. Wanted more practical advice but its ok. I will read it and take what I can use.
5,Beautiful Chamber Music from Amadeus,"This is the third CD I have purchased by the Mozartean Players on Classical Express.Everything that this ensemble has recorded on this label is first rate. The performances are delightful and light. The recording quality is exceptional.The trios the ensemble have released are beautiful, but I believe this recording of Mozart's little known quartets is my favorite recording by this group.If you like Mozart - and particularly his chamber music - buy this CD now!!!"
2,Period Instruments,If you like mozart performed on period instruments instead of the rich full sound of a modern piano this album might be for you. I find the sound tinny and weak and almost impossible to listen to. I will try to find the same beautiful music performed and recorded better.
3,Bottle makes a mess,"The cleaning liquid is really thin, which is fine, but the bottle it comes in is poorly designed for the liquid inside. The hole at the top of the bottle is way too big - too much product comes out and it goes everywhere, including all over the bottle. I used to buy wine cleaning soap that came in a bottle with a pinhole size dispenser. That worked perfectly. But I guess they stopped making it because I can't find it anywhere. I regret not keeping the bottle.The soap is good - it works well and leaves no residue. But I need to find a better bottle to transfer it into."
3,Not bad if you're willing to work at it,"The liquid does not go very far, so you have to use more then expected, making this somewhat expensive. I was a little disappointed at streaking/residue. It made me want to wash the glasses again in a few cases."
4,Great live Chuck!,"Great music , arrangements, and playing. I was a fan of Chuck's before Feel So Good and he kept his music great after that. His writing and arranging have always been his strengths but he is playing is good on this live offering with strings and horns.- kh"
2,Programming problems,I purchased this product several years after release. The computer operating system that it ran off of was out of date and incompatible with new programs. Also after finding an old XP system a library still would not load even with the help of several tech support people.
5,My daughter loves him!,"My daughter really loves her Elmo, which she got for Christmas. My only complaint is that his memory only lasts for a couple of weeks then it has to be reset. And, we don't know his memory is off until we hear him singing the Goodnight Song in the middle of the night, waking everyone up!"
5,Awesome toy,"I purchased this toy for my son who is 13 months old.. My whole family thinks that it is the cutiest toy ever. I have recommended this toy to everyone in my family who has chldren and even friends. I an mow in the process of purchasing this toy for my neice. It was very easy to program the info into Elmo. The only thing I did not like was that when programing the favorite foods you only had the options of what was on there drop down list instead of what you wanted to put in, and there was only enough inpt areas for 3 friends names only. But otherwise a wonderful toy"
1,Big rip-off!,This was a complete rip-off-- 80% of the article is just a list of the books that she has written-- the information in the remainder of the article was already FREE online! I'll never purchase one of these again!
3,Hollow bolt is threaded.,I installed these in my van to tie down a bike. I still haven't been able to get the 'removable' eye bolt out.
4,"Works great, bigger than expected, hard to tighten.","Works great, bigger than expected. Wish the receiving nut/bolt was not just round on the top so you could get a wrench on it, a couple of flat edges would have made things much easier."
2,Not impress with the presentation,"This CD ""Musik of Germany"" is identical as # 1 of ""All the best from Germany. The #2 CD is in English, really not a German CD. (German Music Fest)??? The 43 German Favorits is much better in selection and presentation."
1,Don't bother using with Vista,"Belkin's website has a Vista driver, but don't bother using it. Driver setup application hangs. Managed to get past the hang by launching the driver under a debugger (ntsd.exe) and continuing past all the access violation breaks. Once the driver was installed, I found that the throughput is horrible. Communication through the serial port is roughly 25% the speed of what it should be, no mater what baudrate you use. I am definitely returning this device."
1,Not what I thought,The cable is mearly an adapter to connect your serial port cradle to a PC that has a USB port. Completely worthless when you have a Palm 505 which only comes with a USB connection. I thought this was a direct connect to a PC for quick connects and synchronization.
2,"Great Title , unexceptional read",Much of wht Joseph Umidi has written is without question important to understand and apply in ones life. He talks a lot about Transformational Coaching but does not tip his hand on the actual nuts and bolts of how to actually do it. He does give a lot of important principles. Instead he invites you to take his 40 week course to learn. I am a PhD in Education and have three masters degrees in counseling and divinity and have been a coach and counselor for 25 years that being said I remain disappointed to find the book is one long advertisement to join his army of Transformational Coaches and take his class..
1,Troublesome....then self-destructs,"I had a Dell Axim which I sold on eBay to get the 4700. The Axim was well done and it simply worked. The 4700 has been too troublesome to use regularly. The WiFi software gets moody, PDF files don't always display (has no converter like the Axim does), the backup battery discharges in a couple of days even with the unit off, and doesn't have enough memory for some applications. I've had it about a year, and now it won't boot...just out of warranty. It just comes up with a white screen. I've tried everything, including firmware update using the boot loader. HP Tech support was no help. After paying about $600 for this thing which I haven't used much, now I need to spend a few hundred bucks on repair. It has a great screen though!?! I think I'll take the screen out and sell it on eBay."
4,Great reggae CD,"This was one of the best reggae CDs I have bought in awhile. Ricky Rocksteady is a talented dude. If you enjoy reggae, or even Sublime style ska, you should pick up this CD."
4,Haven't had it longer enough to know....,"Love the size of the doll for my granddaughter, material feels good, cute doll. How durable? I only guessed. How fun? Time will tell. Educational?? Would I buy it again? Of course!"
2,don't wear your hello kitty undies,"Great length, nice solid construction with springy waistband - so, what's the problem lady ?? You could see right thru them - had to give each kid another pair of shorts to wear underneath. So, go for dark colors and avoid the white, unless your team required such, and my two did."
4,Jewish Literacy by Joseph Telushkin,A wealth of knowledge. Glad I purchased it. I refer to it frequently and it is always interesting and informative.
3,No Dustjacket. Not as shown.,"The book was described as very good but had no dustjacket (in the picture) as sent and spine was curved inward. I expected better for a rating of ""Very Good"". I would not have bought it if it were rated lower. Therefore the rating was misleading."
5,Wide open Sanctuary of knowledge,"Perhaps the learned Christians should revisit the Judaic wisdom?This book invites you to do so.The author retraces and illustrace the multiple faces and facets of a great philosophical attitude toward life, social values and comparative societies.Heavy subjects. But the author presented the core with clarity and an enchanting style.Great book."
4,well written comprehensive information about jewish culture and the jewish bible,"I am a christian and I wanted to have a book which provide information about the jewish culture and the tannack (jewish bible) from a Rabbi perspective, I found what I was looking for in this volume... great work!SR"
3,Bits and Pieces,"As other reviewers say, this is an encyclopedia. As such it offers bits and pieces of information and Jewish learning. The agenda is Orthodox but meant to appeal to all Jews and to speak to all Jews. It can't do that for all its good intentions. And it can be overwhelming if you aren't Jewish. Be aware of the size and weight of the book--its one you don't carry around with you but leave on the shelf for reference rather than for reading. As such, it might be worth consulting in a library rather than buying. On the other hand, Telushkins' big books make decent Bar Mitzvah gifts if you don't want to give an atlas or a set of Rashi."
5,Christian point of view,"I found this book very informative. Don't let the size scare you, it's any easy read. Everything on the basics of Judaism is in this book. Everything from history to religion. It left me wanting to know more....Rabbi Joseph Telushkin also includes a wonderful,useful index and references some interesting further reading books. This book has become a permanent part of my library. Highly recommned!"
2,"WOW, WAS THAT DIFFICULT TO FINISH!!!","This is my 4th RABAN, and, my least favorite, by far.I really like the way RABAN writes, his command of thelanguage is excellent and his story-telling is very picturesque.All that said, I didn't get this book!!! What was the point???I wanted to stop quite a few times, but, I finished it.For only 350 pages----it read like 700."
3,"Thought provoking, empty shell","This is a book of gaps - gaps in time, gaps in explanation, and gaps in feeling. While it does inspire thought, the ending folds itself into an empty experience that has too many loose ends from the early acquaintance the reader makes with the principal character. Although it has its moments, moments do not a memorable book make."
1,poor quality,"Received these toys today along with another knight from another company through Amazon.com -- ALL the toys were defective -- well, I guess you'd call them defective -- the knight's hair need glueing back on, each of the characters had some part of them that fell off, was never on properly -- very poorly made and very disappointed 11 year old grandson.He had just read the book, via Amazon.com, Castle In The Attic, and was very excited about playing with the knights and other characters. What a disappoint after paying near $100 for all that we had to do repairs on those we could and just ""deal"" with the problems of the others -- guess that's a lesson learned for the 11 year old with ordering unseen items via the internet."
5,Chips of Fun,This denim lapis chip stretch bracelet and matching earrings are a fun way to liven up a casual outfit. I love wearing them with my jeans!
4,third one i have owned,"i am a professional carpenter, and have owned three of these hammers, mostly because of the wooden handle. the only problem that i have experience is that the handle brakes too easily at the hammer head. i wish they could use a higher quality hickory for the handle. i believe then i could give it 5 stars"
2,Dry,"Ewen's research may have been extensive, but this doesn't make up for the fact that this book reads like he had to put in a SAT word every five lines just to prove that he can ""write."" Don't get me wrong, I've heard him speak, and his speech is not what this book is: dry, intellectual boredom."
5,Four and a half -- Groundbreaking Examination of Consumer Culture,"This book is eye-opening and will cause you to question the extent to which your needs are manipulated by advertising and transformed into desires. Pretty dense research and dissection of the power of visual images to create and sustain a market economy.A perfect complement to the BBC documentary series by Adam Curtis, A Century of the Self."
4,Good coverage of the late model electronic Quadrajets,"Since I have a recent Quadrajet, 1986 with electronic controls, I needed to be able to rebuild my carburator without screwing it up. The performance modifications section wasn't of great value to me. The authors coverage of the APT was a bit superficial. He chose to advise the reader to count the number of turns to remove it, when in reality you need to count the number of turns til it bottoms out, then you know where to set it upon re-assembly. His advise was not to mess with it but put it back to the factory setting, assuming it was at the factory setting to begin with. Since I knew my carb was running rich to begin with, I leaned out the APT from where it was when I removed it and the authors APT test worked as described. My motor now runs nice and smooth.Overall this was a very good book. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to understand how the Quadrajet works before taking one apart.Carl King[...]"
5,A Great Reference For Factory Trained Professionals,"I am retired from a career as a Service Tech at the local Chevrolet Dealer and, as such, attended all the tech schools for QuadraJet Carburetors when they were current production. I still have and use the GM Training Center text given from those seminars. But, when it comes to modifying these carburetors for performance and competion use, the factory manuals are of no use. That's when a book like this becomes extremely valuable. Mr Ruggles goes to great lengths in explaining the function of the basic carburetor and then examines closely the methods he uses to tailor a Q-Jet for use on performance engines. I found the book incredibly interesting and have used the methodology described herein to get myself out of some difficult jams. While the text will guide you through the basics of rebuilding a QuadraJet Carburetor, it's targeted at those who have a firm understanding of internal combustion engines and carburetion principals."
3,Falls Short,"I bought this book with the impression that it would address the challenges of modifying a CCC QuadraJet for competition use. It did not. There was a lot of good information accompanied by, sometimes, excellent photography. The author made a rather sudden transition from ho-hum basic rebuild information to very technical procedures then ended with page after page of very specific carburetor/setup combinations based, as near as I can determine, on carburetors the author has built in the past. His discussion of idle air requirements and modifications was very complete and useful. I gave this book (along with a basic kit and grimy old QuadraJet) to a novice rebuilder and told him to go as far as he wanted to go with it but to not get bogged down in the last half."
5,Greatest quadrajet book ever printed (and I've read all of them).,"There is no finer or more informative book in print. This book has every important piece of information you need to know about the quadrajet. There are many other good books, this is the best book!!!!"
5,"Cute men... oh, to many!","The 7th book is finally out and it is great!!! I had to hit myself from laughing out loud histerically when I read it... This book has to be one of the best yet. I really love the fact that all of the 7 constellations for both sides have finally been revealed. Like the others this one really tests Miaka and Tamahome... because they aren't even aloud to touch one another. I dont want to ruine the book for you, but tamahome did get a gift from the oracle... he can turn into super tamahome, this happens when he goes home to see that Suboshi has killed his entire family, blinded by rage he starts to kill the poor guy... Then a new charecter arrives, called Soi... who saves him from death... Something happens between Miaka and Tamahome there but I'm not going to tell you.P.s this is so funny, because for most of the book they're on a boat... this is where we find out that Tasuki is totally scared of water... You have to see that, it was so FUNNY!!!!"
2,Not worth the money,This was really not worth the money. I bought it for my 5 year old nephew and thought it would be more educational but it was rather lame.
4,leaf curl,The plant is very nice but I lost my first years harvest due to leaf curl a fungus which infects peach trees. This year I treated the trees with a fungicide and they are perfect. Highly recommended
1,RIPPED OFF,This VIDEO is very brief and of little substance. The cost is that of a full length quality documentary. Ben Franklin is demeaned by this swindle.
3,"Nice lotion, not nice scent","Bought this because I LOVE rose scented lotion and these days rose scented anything is very hard to find. Price was good on this product so I took a chance. Lotion feels good on the skin, no too greasy, light, moisturizes fine but I do NOT care for the scent. Very sweet, artificial and quite frankly not at all like rose. Has an artificial, perfumy floral scent but nothing that is distinctly rose - this is the only reason for the 3 stars. I much prefer Rose Milk but its so expensive for a much smaller quantity. Disappointed."
3,First impression,"The course seems built in a quite rigid form. It's not easy for the student, to adapt the course to his/her best way of absorbing the language."
5,BEST EVER,"The last stuffed tiger I bought (The Gund Nolan tiger) ended up being a bit punier than it looked in the picture. This one, on the other hand, was much larger than I expected it to be. It's giant, and more importantly, pudgy and wide, so it's the perfect cuddly toy. The materials are extremely soft, and the toy really looks good, to top it off. I would say you are getting much more than your money's worth for the price. I am delighted with this toy."
5,Awesome,"This tiger is huge and so soft. My daughter uses it as a pillow in her bed.On a more disgusting note, she had the stomach flu and the tiger washed up very nicely afterwards with some spot cleaning."
4,good purchase,"I bought this tiger a month ago, it's really soft and size is just right for me to hug. I love it, and my kids too. They hug the tiger to sleep when I'm not available now!"
1,Disappointing,"As a loyal customer of Amazon, I have found it very disappointing that I have not received this product since I ordered it 5 weeks ago. Especially when it stated the item was in stock. The book is supposed to be excellent, however, its Amazon's service that I'm disappointed with"
4,Good for younger ages,"This is a fun book, but my 1st grader felt it was way too easy for kindergarteners and 1st graders, and would be better suited for pre-school aged kids."
1,Two Duds a Mere Coincidence?,"We received this as a gift, and because its card did not work in our LeapPad, I bought another one. It did not work either. Two duds. We have never had this problem with any other LeapPad book, so I can only assume there is something terribly wrong with the production of the Madagascar software and would not recommend it to anyone."
5,These saws ROCK!!!,Ohhh these pull saws are so much better than push saws. For one thing you get a straighter cut because the teeth entering the wood on the cut stroke are uninfluenced by any wobble you might inadvertently add to the handle.
4,Struggle with At-Risk Teen,"I have enjoyed this book thoroughly. I needed some practical advice on parenting a willful son, and this reading will help me keep things in perspective. The author describes why and how teens become prodigal, and teaches me how to keep a welcome home for my son to feel safe in."
2,Book is for England,"I made a mistake when I bought this book, as I didn't realize it was written by a UK resident, primarily for other UK residents. While the author is obviously an expert with map and compass, the problem is the examples are from a UK point of view, where the maps are not typically in the format one would see in the US.My bad, but can't recommend it for use in the US. However, if you are traveling to the UK and plan on doing a lot of hiking there, it would be a good reference."
3,Steeped in Tradition,"These CDs are a decent purchase because you gets lots of traditional pub songs for a cheap price, but you get what you pay for. First, it should be established that these groups are all from the 1960s, so they didn't have the benefit of modern technology to enhance their sound. This is a benefit and a drawback. The sound is almost analog even though it is in a digital form, which gives you a sense of being in a pub. However, at the same time, the sound seems empty at times. It is all a matter of preference. The Rocky Road to Dublin is well done but it is almost too mechanical. It would be nice if the Dubliners would let loose and add some variation to the tempo. The other tracks are basically the same as well. My favorite track is by far The Wild Rover which is perhaps the most famous waltz in the history of Irish music, but the other tracks are equally as good. Overall this album is pretty good considering the year in which in the music was performed. I give it 3.5 stars."
1,Russian for Kids,"Was very surprisied to see what was included in this book. No kid learning Russian language need to know about Communism , dictators and embarassing moments in Russian history the book reffers to. A lot of statements made in the book are false. There are also general and spelling errors through the book. Very disappointing."
3,Works but you swaybar issues,"This bag setup will work fine for most buyers. For me it works as described but I had to remove my swaybar. I previously was running a Hellwig setup that gave up after 12 years of use. I did have a problem with one side leaking down, but a call took care of the issue and the replacement parts were sent after spending 20 minutes on the phone with Air Lift."
4,As advertised.,I bought this for a 1998 Chevy Metro 3 cyl. Fit in perfect and no problems so far. Only had it a few days but it seems well made.
3,Extremely watery,Extremely watery and hard to apply to your skin. I'm not sure if it works but it is very soothing and cold. I would rather pick up a gel in the future
5,Real Aloe/ Real Healing,"Has a much wetter consistency than the aloe gels you're probably used to but is very effective with healing properties.I've used it on burns, minor skin irritations and it even makes personal hygiene after bowel movements much more comfortable and pleasant by applying it on toilet paper or cleansing wipes."
5,best skin moisturizer,"I have oily and acne-prone skin and I have been fighting with adult acne for years. From what I can tell is that my skin is not hydrated enough, so it produces somehow excessive sebum trying to keep the moisture. If I use alcohol based toner/astrigent, the alcolol dries out my skin even more. I have been trying all kinds of facial moiturizer from designer bands to those doctor's lines. Lots of money and time wasted till I tried this Aloe Vera.After I wash my face, I put this Aloe Vera juice on as a toner, followed by regurlad moisturizer and sunscreen. (I may leave out those moisturizer someday.) Only a day or two, I can really tell the difference. My skin is plum and soft, much less oil/shine on my face. My skin is calmed down by this aloe vera juice. Red marks after acne is less notible. With this new skin care routine and regular exfoliation, my acne is gone and no more."
2,Not what I expected,"""I was hoping that the aloe vera gel would have been a jelly like substance. But instead it was watery. So I was dissapointed. It seems more siutable for drinking instead of applying to the body, as I figured it was for. I would not recommend drinking it, but for application to the skin, I am not too sure. Hopefully I would find a pure aloe vera product that is more ""jelly-like"" instead of watery."""
4,My new skin toner,"I was looking for some aloe vera to apply on my eyelash. As this one was too watery, I tried using it as a replacement to my regular toner. It works so great! My troubled spot goes down for a little bit right after I apply it on my face. The only thing that I dislike is the smell. I don't know if I received an expired bottle?? The smell isn't strong, but once you smell it, it is terrible."
5,AMAZING SUN PROTECTION,"I use only organic products and this product was highly rated. It is amazing. I apply it in the morning while I do my make-up, using both the lotion for my face and the one for the rest of me. We have a swimming pool so i am spending hours in the sun. I also garden for hours in the sun. I NEVER burn. Today I did not apply it to my back but I did my arms and I can actually see my fingers where I reached around! It is wonderful protection, inexpensive, but most importantly it does not put any harmful ingredients into my system. I love it."
2,Highly recommended by some but...,"Based on the Sunscreen Report - EWG's Skin Deep i decided to dump the brand name sunscreens i have and go with ones that are less harmful and toxic. So I purchased 3 sunscreens from Amazon. Burnout Ocean, Burnout SPF 30 for Kids and Aubrey Organics. The only one that is worth keeping is the Burnout SPF 30 for kids.Aubrey Organics was a bit watery.... as expected and very thin in terms of consistency, which means i had to use a lot and lot of it to get a ""full"" coverage. The things is once applied, you can't see if it's there or not. Meaning if you go for a swim or after a couple of hours, you can't tell if the sunscreen is still there or if you need to re-apply.That was OK with me, what turned me off was the smell. It smelled like old oil paint. I just couldn't stand it. If unscented means smells like cooking oil, i rather get the scented one."
2,Moistuizer - Denatured Alchol the problem?,"The 4th and 5th ingredients are alcohols and this is probably what makes the blue green algae moisturizer smell horrid. What else is weird is seconds after I apply this I get ""sweat"" appearing where I put it. Imagine sweat like you would very first get while working out, except I'm not working out, I am standing still in a 70 degree bathroom. I can wipe it away but it will still appear for the next 30 minutes... unrealJust doesn't seem to work well and the 10 minutes of research I did on denatured alcohol on your skin was not positive.I tried this because EWG skin deep says it doesn't have any bad stuff in it, which may be true, but I'm looking elsewhere.Disgusting smell and I think it may actually draw moisture from your skin?!"
3,Temporary Relief,This product will give you temporary relief. If you have foot problems see a podiatrist and get a good ointment.
2,Unpleasant smell & too watery,"I bought this product expecting it to have a more gel like consistency but it ended up being too watery. It is almost like a toner. Plus, it had a weird smell to it and I couldn't stand it unless I put a separate cream on top of it to cover up the smell. It didn't break out my skin but it also didn't do much. Then again, I only used it for 2 weeks and I stopped because of the smell. I think it would be better for me to just purchase the actual aloe vera plant."
3,Aloe Vera Gel,"A pretty good product for the price. It came out like a liquid rather than a gel, but in my understanding, I think Aloe Vera juice is supposed to have a watery consistency. Didn't irritate my skin, but I prefer using tea tree oil for blemishes, personally."
4,Aubrey Organics - 100% Pure Aloe Vera Review,I rate this product with 4 out of 5 stars because this product works and does what I purchased it to do. I really love the fact that this totally natural and organic. It also doesn't contain any fillers like other aloe vera products I have researched and thought about purchasing .After using this I would definitely recommend this product to a friend or family member.
2,Not GEL - Not 100%,Not same product as pictured. Very unsatisfied. This is not a gel and not 100 % Aloe Vera. Not even the same bottle as pictured. Look somewhere else.
1,Not what I expected!,"I thought that this product was going to be somewhat like a gel, and turns out that it is the same consistency as water. It was very messy to apply."
3,Not what I expected,"I guess I should have read the reviews first. Thist is not Aloe Vera Gel. It's just watery aloe vera. Like the stuff you can drink as a supplement. Disappointing. I wanted something that would soothe my adult acne, but sadly, this just fell right off my face. Amazon shouldn't call this aloe vera gela when the bottle just says ""aloe vera."""
3,Try other brands,I was recommended to use Aubrey organics and I honestly do not like any of their products.As for this one since its watery you can use this as a skin toner like witch hazel.Aloe vera contains natural anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.Its gentle and cool on the eyes while wiping you face.
2,Aubrey Organics SPF 30 Children's Unscented Sunscreen,"What I am looking for in a sunscreen: safe/nontoxic, unscented, and effective. This sunscreen meets the criteria for safety (according to the EWG Skin Deep Cosmetics Database), and is unscented. The problem I have with it is that it is quite oily and causes my face to sweat. Once I'm out in the sun, I feel like I've been basted. The instructions say to reapply after perspiring, which would mean (in my case, anyway) reapplying almost continuously. This really negates any benefits from the sunscreen! Will continue to search for a sunscreen that is equally nontoxic, but not as oily."
1,Not Aloe Gel,"This is not Aloe gel, but instead Aloe Juice. Product is mis-labled. Having used the Aubry gel, it is one of the best, but this is not it."
2,Sad Product,"I bought this product because I read it was one of the top 5 ""most healthy"" sunblocks available. Unfortunately, it burns and swells your eyes like crazy and it does not do a good job of protecting from sunburn. It is a sad product."
3,Too little,To little product for that much $$$& I love the gel and the juice any aloe that feels gooD bit I think I will be tapping my growing live aloe in the back yard
2,How is the product 100% aloe vera when its got other ingredients in it???,"I have been browsing for 100% aloe vera products and came across this one with good enough reviews. However, How can they call it 100% aloe vera when the ingredients clearly state more than aloe in it. Just a thought!"
2,Liquid formula,"This aloe vera product is more of a liquid than a gel. I use it on my face before applying moisturizer and it absorbs fast. I like how light it feels on my face, but it does not have the most pleasant smell."
3,A little disappointed...,This product is the consistency of water. I'm not sure why everyone is saying this is the same consistency as aloe fresh squeezed from the plant. Aloe is definitely thicker than water. I will be going back to buying aloe gel capsules from the drugstore since there doesn't seem to be a better option.
4,aloe for skin care,"This product seems to be helping my skin. Wish it were a little thicker, it is a little to runny. Otherwise great."
4,Good Product,"The cable works great with my SGH-707 but the cd did not have the right driver. However, you can download the correct driver from samsung.com. I recomend to buy the cable and then download the driver for your phone."
1,DONT BUY THIS!!!!,"I got this and got hyped up for it but when I got it and tried to use it the computer didnt recognized it. Even after installing the necessary drivers, the cable wont work. Do Not Buy!!"
1,Dead End,I ordered this product a month ago and I have been calling every since. Product arrived defective nothing on the CD. I have called several times and was told a new one would be shipped. I have yet to receive it.I don't think i would order from them again. This should have been easy to fix.
2,wouldnt recommend,for some reason the software included with this shipment did not work on my windows XP machine. i tried installing all the different versions that came in the CD.but it did work on another win 2000 computer...
2,Wrong Cable,By GC. The end that goes to the phone didn't fit my phone. I have a samsung sync a707. I'm thinking the cable that was sent to me fit the sgh-d807.
1,1 Star is too much,"This is a total waste of time and money, China made, bad materials, it broke the second time i used it.DONT Waste your money on this garbage."
1,Worst Item,I brought this data cable from a bundle offer which has the SD Card + datacable + Head Phones. This data cable didn't even read anything. It is just opening something which the SD Card don't have. Pls don't buy this. Even if this product comes free pls throw this. Iam really annoyed with this product.
5,Works without the CD,"The item was received quickly and works great. There was no need for the little CD software diskette (included with cable) because the Samsung Website provides the most up-to-date software updates for the phone. I would recommend downloading the updates and then plugging up the USB Cable. I have the blue SYNC 707. Helpful Hint -- It almost appears that the cable doesn't fit the phone, but it actually fits upside down (arrow on bottom)."
1,Software is not usable on XP for Samsung -SGH-A707,The software supplied with this cable will not work with XP for the SGH-A707 and no updates from Samsung work with the SGH-A707 on XP either
1,CD driver not effective,"The cable fit the phone just fine, but we can not find a driver or software that will make this cable do anything. Not worth the money."
3,"Slightly misleadeing, but useful","The product description for this is slightly misleading - the included CD does NOT contain the drivers for the phone/cable; those must be downloaded from the Samsung website. The included CD contains only a poorly written instructional PowerPoint presentation on how to set it up once you have the drivers.On the other hand, it's cheap, and once you get the Samsung drivers it works fine - just don't expect them to tell you how to get it working. The instructions are crap, but if you're of average intelligence you can figure out how to set it up and use it. Good value for the moderately tech-savvy."
1,Do not buy,"I go suckered in to buying this and was really exited waiting on it. When i got it in the mail i found that the c.d. they burned and sent with it would not work. You had to have the product license number, which i did not have because apparently it was a burned copy. i was never able to get it too work. my advvice to you is not to buy this product, but if you want to chance it you may be lucky. I wasnt"
4,good buy,"The USB data cable is good and a good buy, but you need to download the necessary software to synch on line from the Samsung website.The product arrived in timely manner as promised."
4,Great idea,"I bought this at a fraction of the cost that I would have had to pay at the cellular company. It works great although I still have to make the time for figure out why it isn't properly copying my calendar from Outlook. Otherwise, it's great. I have all my information (numbers, address' and apnts) on my computer and my phone."
1,1 star because -1 isn't available.,"Doesn't work at all. Checked online and apparently some companies are wiring these incorrectly. It wasn't even worth my time to send it back, so I just ate the cost. Bluetooth solved the issue for me."
5,Finally,"I had spend all summer camped out in Bluestone Wild Forest and had a ton of pictures and video on my Samsung A707. I checked around for this cable and found prices to be well above what could be considered fair-$25.00 and up in some cases. When I found it here I read the mixed reviews and despite some of the comments the cable was a couple of dollars and the annoyance then was shipping was more than the cable cost. It arrived with a Mini-disc which did not work in my computer. But, as some of the reviewers had spoken of and something I have done with my Sony and other products was to go straight to the website and download the PC/Phone Package. I installed the program, plugged the cable into the phone and my computer and had instant access to the files on my phone! Hooray!If this is compatible with your Samsung, Buy It. Grab the drivers off the Website and take full advantage of the capabilities of your phone, then smile and grumble that shipping was the biggest expense."
3,"its ok, does its job","The CD driver that came with it was totally useless. I had to download my own software from the SAMSUNG site. After i downloaded my own software, it worked perfectly fine."
1,Don't buy this wig!!!,"This is the worst excuse for a wig I have ever seen. It is impossible to position on your head so that it looks like hair, and I didn't even use it after ordering it for Halloween."
2,Delightfully inexpensive and predictably awkward fit,"I normally wear large unitards when I'm out and about, but since other reviewers recommended getting a smaller size, I purchased a medium, which was STILL too large. The boot covers were big enough to cover up my sweet roller blades, but I can't seem to pick up any chicks with that extra fabric flapping around while I'm pulling off those bodice-ripping moves for the ladies. I suppose I could get it tailored, but my tailor won't talk to me since I had him sew a third cup into my man-bra."
1,This sucks,"Terrible fit, nothing like what the guy in the picture is wearing. Even a perfect fitting one would not look like what's in the picture. It look's like spandex but its not, it really looks like a pair of superman pajamas. One of the worst costumes I have ever seen."
2,Smaller than expected,"The costume looks fine and is the quality that you'd expect for the price. The big issue is size. I ordered an extra large, but it was far, far too short. I'd estimate that you'd probably need to be 5'6 or shorter to fit into the cosume. It's plenty wide...just very short.I would recommend trying on this costume in person rather than ordering here."
3,Nice costume if you are below average in stature,"This item comes directly from Amazon, which is a plus. As for the product, unfortunately, if you have a Superman type body, this item will not fit. I ordered my size according to the chart, but it is definitely suited for slim individuals as opposed to athletic individuals. If you are slim, then you still may have a problem if you are tall. the 33"" inseam does not have much give since it is a tight jumpsuit... if you wear a 33"" inseam or longer this will not work for you, and you will end up showing off more than you care! I am about 6'2""; and an athletic 230lbs, the large was too small and the XL was too big in the belly and sleeves.However, if you are of average height and body weight, it should work well for you!"
3,"nice costume quality, size way off","I am a normal size man, almost everything in large fits me and some medium clothes. i bought the large which was way to small and i couldn't wear it."
1,Thong you very much,"I am 6'0'' 175lb and I agree with a previous reviewer who stated the costume seriously rides up the groin area. If you like wearing a thong as a guy, this costume may be for you. If not, this will only work if you are 5' 10'' or less."
5,Right on Time,"Simple to order, quick delivery, exactly as ordered and ready to use for the weekend.Quality is good and can be used in the future as well."
2,Not for a tall person-sizing way off.,"The sizing is really off on this costume. My husband usually wears a 30 inch inseam and this states that the inseam on the costume is 33 inches. There is no way that this is 33 inches! It rode up my husband groin area horribly, it looked obscene. We ordered this to wear to a children's superhero theme party. Not happening. Porn convention, maybe.Making matters worse, the seller (7th Ave Store) is asking me to pay for shipping to return it and is going to charge me a 20% restocking fee. They are also requiring that I purchase a new item and pay for expedited delivery in order to get it in time for the party. It's not my fault that their sizing is off. False advertising and horrible service!"
5,Superman Costume,I really liked this costume a lot. It is very comfortable and perfect for cosplaying. If you are a fan of Superman I definitely recommend this costume. You won't be disappointed.
3,I want to learn coding not reading...,"This is NOT the book to learn how to programming in J2ME! You need a great imagination to learn the content of this book, if you have never experienced J2ME before, beacause it contains little code example. In spite of this, the book contains only 7 compileable code example, all others are code segments -- that is you need to do a lot of tedious coding your self to get it running.This book should more likely be used as a reference manual by experienced J2ME programmer. The structure of this book is clear, so it is easy to retrieve information. But the authors of this book seems have a tendency to fill pages, as they use ""Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition"" and ""Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition"" (and other similar) instead of ""J2SE"" and ""J2ME"" through out the book, as if readers can't remember an acronym!If you are looking for a book for learning ""how to program with J2ME"" you should not choose this one. [...]"
4,good for experienced developers,"This book is good for the experienced developers in J2ME.If you are new to J2ME, this book would not be the rightbook to buy. The weak thing about this book is that itdoes not have a lot of code to look at. By the way,J2ME is not for beginners. The best book to buy isby Jonathan Knudsen. That book has a lot of code.If you want to buy the book by Roger Riggs, buy theKnudsen first. I learned a lot from the Roger Riggs book.The chapters are really short and easy to read.The book by Roger Riggs needs only one more thing:more code. Also, If you want to learn what is new aboutJ2ME, then buy this book. One more thing, make sure you anexperienced JAVA developer before you buy either books thatI previously discussed.Michael"
3,Second Best,"With the standards set so high by Furbank (isn't it telling that the cover added to this web page is the cover of Furbank's biography and not that of Beauman?) there is quite little one can do. One can always go wrong, however, and to some degree this is what the book does. I found its concentration on Forster's homosexuality (can he be outed any more after the publication of Maurice in 1971?) quite tiresome and insistence on stressing his biography and its influence on his works not always substantiated. You can find all the important details here but if you want a good read as well, take the hint from this web page and get yourself a copy of Furbank's biography instead."
4,Crochet Helper,"This book is a great reference for crocheters and a good place to go for inspiration. Lots of different stitch patterns. I saw this at my local library and decided to look and see if I could order a copy for myself, and I found it here! You have to be aware while using it, though, that the UK terminology is listed first, and then the US. Each stitch pattern has instructions that used both terms. The odd thing about this is that none of the stitch patterns have names, they just have pictures and instructions. Very fun and helpful though. I think it's worth it."
1,the worst civil war game but hey at least its expensive,"this was the worst civil war game i have ever played and i have played almost all of them.when i started this game i got so frustrated and angry at the horrible game play i turned it off and uninstalled it and you will too. this game was almost as bad as NAM well almost.i wish someone would have reviewed this game before i wasted my money. well at least i have a $40 coaster. but seriously, dont waste your hard earned money on this waste of a great game concept. if your a civil war buff like me then play the good games like sid meiers' gettysburg or civil war generals 2 by sierra, these are both good games. if you choose to ignore this advice, well see for yourself but youve been warned. have fun in all your gaming adventures but trust me leave this one on the shelves, youlll thank me!"
1,Ripped Off!,"Having spent hundreds of hours playing Sierra's fine game, Civil War Generals 2, I was hungry for something new. The box looked pretty, but ""North vs South"" quickly became a ... doorstop. I have complaints about CWG2's A.I. with regard to certain issues of historical significance; such as the fact that no civil war army remained and fought having taken much more than 15% losses. However, at least the game is fun. N. vs S. is such a chore to play (at first I thought it was me) that it's just not any fun. Someone owes me ..., but...Oh no, I opened the box.AVOID THIS GAME."
1,Warning: Buy to collect dust,"I bought this game after previous exposure to other Civil War strategy games, both widespread and individial battle. In fact, some of this exposure had been with Interactive Magic. This games only disappointed. The interface caused the easiest of manuevers impossible and just plain confusing. Even doing the walkthrough in the manual was impossible. Just stay away and buy another product."
5,Info on the book-,"Discusses sales personality, persuasion, customer psychology, and sales calls, and provides practical advice on finding prospects, remembering names, building contacts, improving communications skills, and making successful presentations.The ""Classic"" on closing sales and a very rare book to find in the Hardcover edition."
3,Disappointed....,"The spoken content on the CD is good, but the documentation (pdf file on the CD) is poor in quality (very poor resolution) and poor in written content. Disappointed..."
5,Complete Language Course(Learn in your Car),"A very easy way of starting a new language. Instructions are simple and the whole program is very easy to follow. The lessons start straight away, no need to listen to long winded explanations of what is going on. This is the second language program in this series that I have used and would recommend this to anyone wanting to get the basics for overseas travel."
5,A Lovely Read,"I thought Rice Without Rain was an absolutely spectacular book. A story that has love, war - what else could one want? RWR also brings the conflict in Thailand out into the public eye and has informed thousands about these violent periods in Thailand, of which the general population probably is vaguely aware of.The main character and our heroine, Jinda, is a very simple, good natured young woman, and warms the hearts of all readers with her innocent naivete. The characters are so real in this novel, that they will stay for you months after. They have with me.I personally would reccomend this piece to anyone. It has been the foundation of my newfound love for Asian literature."
4,A glimpse into a rice growing culture,"Everything seems natural until some college students come into the village to convince the people that they are entitled to a better life. This creates alot of conflict between the rice growers and their landowners. Sacrifice and hardship ensue, but the second generation may very well reap some benefit. Monsoons - Rice Growing - Thailand."
4,FANTASTIC BOOK,"I THINK IT HAD A VERY GOOD START. IT COULD OF STARTED A LITTLE BIT FASTER. I LIKE THE BEGINNING OF IT BECAUSE IT TALKED ABOUT A FAMILY WHO GREW RICE. IT ALSO TALKED ABOUT TWO SISTERS AND THEIR GRANDMA. I LIKE THE PART WHERE HER SISTER HAD A BABY. THEY USED ALL KINDS OF STUFF TO GET IT OUT. I ALSO LIKE THE PART WHERE HER FATHER GETS THROWN IN JAIL. I THOUGHT THE ENDING WAS OKAY, BUT THE STORY DID DRAG A LITTLE AT THE END."
3,Oh that Fabulous Dietrich!,"Marlene Dietrich is the epitome of glamour even in this day and age. There has never been anyone like her in Hollywood. And in this book we see her in all her glory. Baxt's character depictions are very real and are definitely the strong point in his ""silver screen mysteries"". We also see many cameo appearances by other favourites - Cary Grant, and my personal favourite, Tallulah Bankhead. In this story one of Marlene's guests at a New Year's Eve party is murdered in front of all her gursts. Marlene sets out with Herb Villon to trap a killer, and instead discovers a huge conspiracy that spans the globe. More murders occur, but the fabulous Dietrich actaully gets her man. As I mentioned, one reads these books for Baxt's character portrayals. They are wonderful. He gives us a real insight into these glorious screen legends. The mystery and the intrigue are not so exciting."
3,Great while it lasted,"Bought these lights in mid-August and immediately put them up.When I first plugged them in, I was disappointed, as they didn't twinkle. But after they warmed up, they began and created a wonderful effect.I put them on a timer, so they were on 2-4 hours / night. However, now about 1/3 of the bulbs are blown out. I'm going to see if it's the bulbs that ""twinkle"", or something in the wiring. Hopefully I can simply replace the bulbs, but I'm guessing it's the bulbs themselves that do the ""twinkling."""
3,She smiled all through the show,"I used to work for Lurene Tuttle, an actress in this movie. She played the wife of Leon Ames, who has the only working ham radio in town. There's a scene at their home and Lurene says something about reaching a man in Oklahoma, I think. I haven't seen the movie in years. The only time I watched it was with Lurene, and even tho the subject matter is so terribly sad and disturbing, she smiled all through the show. When it was over, I was ready to cry, but she looked at me and chattered away about the wonderful setting, the costumes, the camera man, etc. etc. NOT a word about the plot. But after being in theater and movies for almost 70 years, I guess she looked at other things..... I didn't even know this movie had been released. I'll had to add it to my Lurene Tuttle collection. Lurene is the red-head in the movie ""Niagara,"" played Jack Lemmon's mother in ""Fortune Cookie, "" and also in ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken."""
2,Way Over Rated by Amazon Reviewers,"I bought this DVD based on all the positive reviews, and boy was I disappointed! The story goes nowhere, the kids are whiney brats, and believe me, you'll be GLAD the Dad is only in the first few minutes of the movie. Yes, the mother character is well acted by Jane Alexander, but the dialogue is lame, the plot is dead, the scenes are choppy, the events are predictable, the townspeople are annoying, and there's a lot of crying. A lot. I'd give it one star just to drop this over-inflated 4 1/2 star rating, but thought 2 stars was more honest."
1,Stay away from this one.,"Beware, Beware, Beware. This is a warmed over lifetime movie about a family dealing with death. If you are expecting a ""dangers of nuclear war"" movie like On The Beach, The Day After, Fail Safe or the like, I would suggerst staying away from this one. It is not a thriller, the characters are very poorly developed and there is no clear story. I hoped that at some point a stray bomb may fall into the main characters city. It might have helped to give some explanation of what was going on. No special effects at all. Bright light means nuclear bomb. People just go away or drop dead though they had no sign of disease......... You've been warned!"
5,"Be afraid, be very afraid !!!","This was one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. I saw it when it was originally released and it was the first movie I thought of given the present political climate in the world. The story never says who did what, when or who started it - only the MADD results follow the people in this story. Anyone who doubts we have to watch out for terrorists MUST watch this film. Excellent movie, but not for the children. Jane Alexander showed us every mother's nightmare."
5,Excellent service.,"Excellent portrayal of a difficult time we all feared in the 50's, 60's and 70's."
4,The Lasting Effects of Nuclear War,"This movie takes place in an area a ways from the targeted - being San Francisco but yet the impact and lasting effects of the nuclear attack are felt all the same. While ""The Day After"" and the UK-made ""Threads"" deliver a more grizzly picture - relying on the actual destruction, as they tend to focus on areas in which are the targets or are near such a target, this movie shows a community far away suffering all the same from the economical and radioactive fall out. This movie paints a grim and bleak situation with no real future as if to say that whether or not a nuclear war destroyed buildings and cities or not it's effects are devastating and will far outlive the war itself."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A quiet and moving (and bleak and depressing) look at America before the end, Testament never attained the level of cultural penetration that The Day After did but in its own way its a worthier film; with a powerful performance by Jane Alexander in the lead and a conclusion that'll put a lump in your throat, it's quite a little gem."
5,It fits---it is as simple as that.,"""Symbiotic Planet"" may sound to the average reader like just another attempt to ""classify"" life on our little Earth. This would be an error. This book, as is typical of Dr. Margulis' writing is precise, complete, and allows the reader to easily follow along this amazing journey through time and life itself. I have read, as well as reviewed a number of Dr. Margulis' books through the years, and stand in awe at how she can ""break down"" what to myself seems an incredibly complicated idea, into plain common examples. Her writing captivates the mind of the reader, to the point that it seems impossible to put down. I am a very slow reader-yet I finished the book (the first time) in a single day. One cannot stop reading it is just that fascinating! There is little I can say that would be nearly adequate to properly describe this book. The reader will decide for themselves that is really is a great read and a great book to keep as reference. It really is as simple as that."
3,Good but self-indulgent,"An interesting book by an author who is rightly associated with a major paradigm shift in how we think about cells. I found the text readable and largely enjoyable. However, I was significantly distracted by the emphasis on the author and her high opinion of herself. For the reason I stated previously, this high opinion may be justified, but it was distracting and annoying to read. I also found some of the figures to be anachronistic and not well integrated into the text."
3,Somewhat disappointed...,"While I will admit that this book is very informative, I was slightly disappointed for the same reason I have experienced with some other jewelry books. Of all the pictures only a handful are in color. Always confusing to me why they do this because jewelry is one thing that you really need to see in color to appreciate. I would recommend this book for it's information but if you are looking for great color pictures to go along with the definitions I would pass on buying it."
2,Lacked the Sizzle!,"I felt that this book was lacking in the sizzle that it spoke about on the back cover of the book. The hero is supposed to be the stripper Lord Sin and no one is aware of this? I found that very unbelievable and thought the whole book was too predictable. The heroine, who is an intelligent journalist who is determined to unmask Lord Sin, does not seem to be able to put two and two together and come up with four. No instead she is confused at her attraction for two different men. I would say this is an ok read if you have nothing better to do."
5,One Terrific Read!,"This is a witty, sexy, well-written romance. Lord Sin has to be one of my favorite heroes!'Baring It All' was my first Sandra Chastain book, but it definitely won't be my last!"
5,Excellent!,"This was a great romance! I loved it! I have reread this bookseveral times, it was so good! I would love to see Elaine Coffmanwrite a sequel involving the two characters Cad and Anna! Happy ending of course! END"
3,decent house at a slower pace,"My main reason for loving this CD is song number 6 on disc one: ""Forca (This is the Life)"". Amazing and killer! It made me want to roll to the floor and start voguing right then and there. The second disc, a continuous mix, grew on me slowly. I would say this collection is not necessarily sexier than other house, just slower. It's for those who use house to chill, rather than to get the party started. This would be a soothing CD for when you have that special guy over, but it's not perfect. It's just pretty decent."
5,This book marks a huge break in US counter-poetics,"This book with its innovative range of essay/poems and poems/essays marks a huge break in US counter-poetics in the, say, Jack Spicer mode of counter-hegemonic languagings and transnational westcoast imaginary.The 'break' occurs somewhere in the Reagan era of political amnesia and neo formalism and petunia-poetry poetics of David Lehman et al; but for readers like me schooled in the Whitmanic sublime canon and US cultural poetics, never would US lyric poesy be the same after the 'new sentence' came down from on high or, better said, from the streets below the exclusionary lyric apparatus: I read the ""Alphabet"" work sentence by sentence clotted, dazed, dusted, displaced, amazed at the sheer syntactic inventiveness and learning. Ron Silliman has renovated the syntax and linear formation of US poetics discourse from inside its white heat dead man walking/talking core."
4,As Advertised but shipping horrible.,"This is a good product. They used to handle them at ACE Hardware, but no longer. The only problem I had is that when the product arrived, the delivery person was simply holding the handle through the top of the shipping box, with the box completely open and not useful at all. They had just kept them together in order to determine the ship to address."
2,"Pie, maybe. Pastry, no.","This product seemed like it would be the answer to rolling out my delicate pastry doughs. However I didn't find it at all useful for this particular task and only served to add another level of aggravation. Though the pastry board got cool, that was about it. It didn't generate enough cold to keep the dough from softening at it's normal rate on my non-cooled rolling surface. I also had a problem with sticking unless I were to add a significant amount of flour which would have made the dough tough. I can see where this board might be better suited for pie doughs where a more heavily floured rolling surface would not be such a problem, and the measured circles are a handy reference, but for doughs containing a significant amount of butter it didn't meet my needs."
1,poor,this subwoofer is a kids toy. when i recieved it it was damaged. the front grill was bent up . i called up samash .they asked me to email pics . of the damage. i couldn`t i dont have a digital camera .after testing the subwoofer. i wasnt impressed. i used a 250 watt amp and the subwoofer blew. i needed this subwoofer for a gig i replaced the woofer with a eminence omega pro 18`` woofer i bought from ebay a month earlier.im very glad i only spent 150.00 on this piece of junk when replacing the woofer i found it to be without brand or name .cheap mass produced junk. not impressed with samash i dont have time to play games
1,"yep, it's junk","The previous reviewer had it right, the new stuff is made in China and it's pretty cheesy. I needed extra pieces for the set I purchased some time ago. My original set was the heavy guage higher quality stuff made in Korea. This stuff isn't worth the postage: it's smaller, flimsier and doesn't even match the pattern. Fuggedaboudit..."
5,Very happy with my Stratford!,"Since I've never had the ""original"" version of this particular pattern, I don't identify with the bad reviews posted here and have always been very happy with my set. They have a pleasing weight and a lovely, modern, elegant style. I found a setting for four at my local discount housewares store (Homesense here in Canada; aka T.J. Maxx or Marshall's for those south of the 49th parallel--same parent company) and have been looking for more settings ever since. It's been my bad luck that the Stratford pattern seems to be discontinued at most physical and web-based retailers. Now I am eagerly awaiting a full set from a seller I found here on Amazon. Can't wait!"
1,Bad spring,"FEATURES A SPRING NOTCH TO RELEASE AND EASILY REPLACE RAZOR BLADE, this spring is not spring steel and will eventually bend and break off causing blades to fall of a shabby imatation of a good product!"
1,buy this only if you have a strong stomach,"Despite the claim of a modern perspective, this is no more than a redressing of the 'scientific' examination of race produced by the Nazis. Not what I expected. I wrapped it with strapping tape and used it as a doorstop."
1,Genetics is more than intuition,"The wonderful reviews of this book I found here are perhaps evidence that we should take all such offerings at Amazon with a boulder of salt. At the risk of being labelled a braying pc-er, let me ask you to THINK BEFORE YOU LEAP into bed with Rushton's perception of human variation. His logic is, in brief...1. Human groups differ in some traits (e.g. crime & sex), 2. Human groups differ in some genes (e.g. those affecting skin color), therefore , 1 is because of 2. This logic is neither ""obvious"" nor ""brave"" nor ""anti-pc""...it's just flawed at the core. Rushton's been rejected by most evolutionary ecologists not because he is a seeker of hard truths that shatter pc illusions, but because he uses blizzards of often irrelevant numbers and paper thin or incorrect logic to make arguments that automatically resonate with many folks regardless of their knowledge of the science involved(see other reviews here). How brave."
4,Great litle book for a good price!,"A questo da raa Ã© extremamente bem explorada neste livro. Apresenta uma linha naturalista e defende o conceito biolÃ³gico de ""raa"". O objectivo do livro - classificao da raa em em trs grupos biolÃ³gicos separados, mostrando que os factores genÃ©ticos so determinantes - Ã© contestÃ¡vel e poderÃ¡ mesmo dizer-se que acentua a ideia de Mill ""contrato racial"". No hÃ¡ explicao do conceito de ""hereditariedade"", porÃ©m, o conjunto de estudos ""raciais"" so bastantes consistentes e mostram a existncia de diferenas entre as diversas ""raas"". Eu considero o livro um clÃ¡ssico e de leitura obrigatÃ³ria para quem inicia a temÃ¡tica biolÃ³gica da ""raa"" ou se interessa pela construo do conceito como uma realidade. Ã excelente para filÃ³sofos, psicÃ³logos, antropÃ³logos, biÃ³logos e todos os que se interessam pela questo de saber se a ""raa"" existe e se sim que relao possui ocm a biologia."
5,Race Evolution and Behavoir,"The most complete book on racial differances I've ever read. The abridged version is simple to read and it gives you a basic understanding without all the charts, graghs and technical jargon. I recommend it."
4,I Suspect that Rushton is Right,"For about thirty years now its been taboo to say that persons whose ancestors are from Sub-Saharan Africa are more athletic and less intelligent than those of European and Asian descent. The premise that all racial differences are exclusively environmental has been a fiction with a useful purpose---to lessen tension between the races and provide hope to disadvantaged blacks. The question which some are now asking is whether that useful purpose outweighs the principle that truth and honesty are virtues to be cherished.If you believe in perpetuating a useful fiction, feel free to berate this book, burn it, suppress all discussion of it, and label all those who accept its basic premise with all sorts of ugly descriptions. However, you should read it first."
4,Good book,"If you are too concerned with being P.C, you wont like this book.It shows a pattern between the races on all sorts of dimensions.From Crime to fertility to age of first sexual intercourse. Its the same pattern - Whites in the middle, Asian and Blacks on both sides.Even Charles Murray of ""Bell Curve"" fame wrote in the afterword to ""The Bell Curve"" that Rushton is a serious researcher and doesnt deserve the flak hes getting froom society, though whether his theory is to be considered fact is still an open issue."
1,Racist Science has no place in this century.,"This book should begin, ""I'm no Pat Buchanon, but my science says..."" The view of intelligence in this book may sell because of shock value or the need for people to justify racism through biased science, but it is easy to find a more eloquently written version of the same type data from the 1800s or early settlers."
1,The epitomy of bad science,If you aren't interested in good science or well thought out prose this is the book for you. Garbage like this is hard to find just anywhere. If this book was being given away at a grocery store I wouldn't take it. Rushton is by far one of our greatest racists alive today and clearly doesn't understand the basics of modern science and has certainly ignored more than three centuries of research on this topic.
1,In a word -- Pseudoscientific,"Science demands that one must define variables before they can be tested. Rushton does not provide a clear definition of race, he simply writes as though it is common knowledge and that everyone just naturally understands what the term means. His ""statistics"" are irrelevant and their validity cannot be judged against his hypothesis due to the fact that he does not precisely define his variables. Before he or someone else can rectify this matter, all interpretations included in this book are invalid. The one star I have given this book is for the fact that it is a good example of pseudoscience."
3,Complete in Neglect,"Preeetty racist and neglectful title considering all the incomplete sociological information and roots stemming from the so-called research. Being a graphic designer it's clear that some of the graphs are manipulated in it's measurements to exaggerate differences between races (other graphs aren't as manipulative). The other reviews sum it up rather good from what I remember. If you want to read some titles that really discuss ""race"" and talk about it in both educational, and scientific contexts; I recommend: Human Variation, Races, Types, and Ethnic Groups (5th Edition) and Human Biodiversity: Genes, Race, and History (Foundations of Human Behavior...). This book is mere child's play compared to the titles above."
1,biased trash,This book uses out of date and misguided data to support inferences that are beyond the scope of that original research. His methods and statements are at best lies based on misinformation at worse down right fabrications.His entire approach shows his personal biases and the entire endeavor is filled with racist rhetoric.The fundamental data he uses as his basis was disproved over 50 years ago. The entire book misinterprets data proven wrong decades ago. It is nothing more than racist rhetoric. Plain and simple.
2,This is more tricky,"Nurture can take many generations. In Poland (from where I come)there is a striking difference between rural areas which were under serfdom and which were under the royal or Church adminstration. The last two were much more humane and benevolent.The former serfdom areas have much more problems with crime, poverty and broken familes. The race in all areas is identical.Second issue is the genetic dynamic of population, withing one racial group the differences are larger than averages between different races. In a relatively short time (maybe few generations) different reporoduction rate can lead to significant shift. BTW, at present more academically gifted people have much fewer children so the natural selection pressure can end in leveling IQ down :)."
5,Thorough and readable-wonderful,"Coming from a background in anthropology where I was bombarded with the Standard Social Science Model that states that race does not exist and differences were entirely due to environment or ""culture"", I became interested in evolutionary psychology and biological/genetic explanations for human behavior. I eventually found this book.Rushton did a great job here documenting the history of Galton, psychometrics, IQ testing, etc. and thus this book served as a comprehensive introduction to this fascinating field. In particular, I was quite interested in the biological basis of personality and racial variations in temperament as well as ethnocentrism and mate selection. Again, Rushton covers these issues in such a way that are both thorough and readable."
3,Some comments,"Many things mentioned in this book may or may not be correct but some of the ideas do seem to fit in. Many Chinese people ponder about the reason for China to fall behind the West. An increasing number of people believe that this is due to China's lack of ""martial spirit"". Because of this, the Chinese invented gunpower but did not use it in weapons but in firework displays. The Chinese built the Great Wall, the most impressive engineering masterpiece of the ancient world, but could not keep out the barbarian hordes. The ancient Chinese had the most technologically advanced, efficiently organised, and tactically developed army in the world but was beaten by disorganised nomadic barbarians on unsaddled horseback. If this book is correct than it's all because of the lack of testosterone."
3,"Facts or hypotheses are never racist or not racist,","it is the interpretation of them that matters.It is important to remember that even though the hypothesis in this book might be correct, the differences shown are differences between statistical group averages, not between individuals. The Bell Curves of intelligence are Gaussian distributions which means the amount of difference in the mean of intelligence between the races is relatively insignificant compared with the difference in intelligence within the races. Thus the data in this book cannot be used to predict the intelligence (or any other trait, for that matter) of individuals of any race. Even if the facts of the book are correct, they still cannot justify racism against blacks or anyone else.Scientific facts do not have moral values attached to them automatically. It is how we interpret the facts and what we do with them that matters."
5,Outstanding realistic fiction!,Sawyers gives accounts of eager young men who are headstrong in their beliefs as they move through their fighting efforts against the other side. He blends his fictional and non-fictional characters with accounts of Civil War history that leave the reader feeling that he is right there with the Confederate and Union forces! This book is a must-read for all history buffs! Can't wait for the sequel!
2,A Slow Read,"I did not really enjoy this book. It was too slow for me and did not get good until the end. I forced myself to read it and although some parts captured my attention, it just made me feel there could have been some more to it. It just didn't do anything for me."
4,Good Read...,"Good story, at first it started off a little slow however story line eventually took off and from there on it was good. Compared to the 1st book, this is just as good if not better. Overall, both books were good with great story telling and I look forward to reading many more of Vicotrs' manuscripts."
4,"Painful past, broken present","There are many layers to WHAT'S A WOMAN DO? as it reads like a family drama mixed with a thrilling mystery. McGlothin weaves an emotional story that will take the reader through a myriad of emotions. Endearing characters abound in the pages of this story and help make it a compelling read. My only problem with the story was that the ending was too tidy. There were many subplots in the novel that were easy to follow and each had its own cliffhanger of sorts. McGlothin seemed to want to offer some closure to the reader by bringing each subplot to a close at nearly the same time which made the conclusion of the story seem too perfect. Despite that, WHAT'S A WOMAN TO DO? was a satisfying read that captured me from word one.Reviewed by Diane Marbury (HonestD)of The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersComplete review can be found on our website..."
3,not really fair to rate what I have not read yet.,"I have not read the book yet. However, I did notice that the price was reduced by $3.00I am looking forward to reading it."
4,Wild idea is enchanting,"O'Brien's story of getting caught on the horns of an idea that won't let him go--reintroducing buffalo to his ranch--is enchanting. So are his descriptions of some of the characters in his life, including the most important one, the high plains. You end up rooting for him and all those other folks enthralled by that hard land."
5,O'Brien Inspires a Love for Conservation.,"In his book Buffalo for the Broken Heart, Dan O'Brien's love for everything alive pours from his soul onto every page- from the grasses to birds,coyotes to buffalo, and from the land to its people- he inspires the conservation of life. He writes with an honesty that comes like a breath of fresh air out on the plains and, as I read, I was instantly transported there with him watching Curly Bill grow. While the book had immense entertainment value, I found it more so educational and thought provoking. As a student of plant ecology and conservation biology, I would highly recommend this book to anyone. It's like finding your way around the ecology of the plains with a GPS and I fell in love with it's simplicity. The only caution I would offer is that it is highly addictive, so make sure to clear your calendar prior to beginning!"
5,Best Book From the High Plains' Soul,"I taught this book in my American West class for years, reread it during a recent lay-up in the Black Hills. Moved all over again by the author of RITES OF AUTUMN and THE CONTRACT SURGEON, books I've also used in the college classroom. God bless Wild Idea enterprises!"
1,"Did NOT Fit my 2008 Honda Accord LX-S Coupe, 4 cyl.","Although the website indicated being the correct set of front brakes for my car, these didn't fit. The end tabs were too wide to fit in the caliper brackets and the outside edges were not camphored. Had to return these to Ama-Zoney and buy something locally, as they were needed in a hurry. I purchased the rear set of brakes - also AC Delco-(part #17D1336CH) from Ama-zony and they fit & installed perfectly. So, my best guess would be that these would be just as good - just be sure that they do fit your car beofre you order. If you happen to have a 2008-2010 Honda Accord 4 cyl. the AutoZone equivalent part number for the front brakes is: DG943 or DGC943. Enjoy life!!"
4,One of the Best Turn based strategy,"Malkari is easily one of the best turn based strategy games I have played to date, despite it being slightly outdated. The scale of the battles and the amount of customizing you can do with the ships is unreal, and I have not seen another game like it to date. Has a tendency to freeze, so I definitely recommend saving fairly often."
3,A nice general reference,"I had high hopes for this book and it is very nicely illustrated with Tirion's famous maps however they are a little difficult to view under red light in the field. Still, they are detailed as are the nicely air-brushed lunar maps of Antonin Rukl. It would have more appeal being illustrated with deep sky images to show what an amateur might expect to photograph or even see at the eyepiece. I think Collins pocket Guide to the Stars & Planets does an overall better job for most beginners.Still, it is a worthy production."
3,3/4 violin case,"good case for the money! This is more like a foam case,not for heavy use. This case looks very nice.If your child needs a violin case for school, I would recomand a more sturdy one."
1,I found not a single useful bit of information in this book for librettists.,"I wanted to know about structure, song placement, roles of songs, examples of structure, any kind of tips at all.This book was so weirdly conceived - it seemed to be written for people who know nothing about musicals at all and was certainly not helpful as a guide or reference book for writing them.I haven't found any other good books on the subject but this really was useless."
3,They are functioning bulbs no better than anything at the auto parts store,"You are buying lightbulbs with less output than regular silver stars. I was really hoping to get a great lightbulb at a great price. They're just cheap bulbs with no additional light output over regular shelf bulbs at any local store. So far, I can't find anything brighter than the silver star ultras. Never been a huge fan of the SS Ultra due to their extremely high price tag, but that's what I finally ended up going with.I know they claim to be 100W worth of light output or whatever garbage is claimed, but they aren't.If you want a cheap replacement, this is the bulb for you.If you want a high performer, this isn't it."
5,Inspirational & Take Action Ideas Galore!,"What a breath of fresh air to find a book that you can pick up & use just by opening it! You do not need to read every page to make use of the wonderful motivational ideas in here.I found this especially useful when all my ideas sound the same or I'm just not getting any new ideas going! Great for youth group leaders, small businesses, school parent groups, and recreation centers."
5,Ceiling fan,This is absolutely a beautiful fan. We purchased this fan two years ago for our beach house and recently bought the same one for our current home. It is whisper quiet. I particularly liked the choice of the two different wood colors on the blades. I found this fan to be much cheaper on the Amazon website.
3,Not Exactly a Bargain,"Those considering this DVD should be aware that it is essentially a 30-minute made-for-tv feature. It is quite well done and includes brief comments by Danny Manning and others but it's actual run time is certainly NOT 90 minutes, as advertised. It has a number of tacked-on ""extras"" which may bring the total time to 90 minutes. However, the feature itself is a half-hour or so, at most. Probably for die-hard Jayhawks, at the price."
4,Not too bad,"This is a solid addition to any KU fan's collection or anyone whom enjoys the game of basketball and wants to learn about one of the best venues that it's played in.Overall it's a decent video and covers topics from former stars such as Wilt Chamberlain who have been there, current and former coaches and players talking about their experiances there, and the history of the building.The bad though is as mentioned in another review it is clearly a made for TV film and is rather short, the bonus features are almost the same as rewatching the main feature just with a little bit of extra info, and it's older. It's from right after the Booth Hall of Athletics additions so there's alot of mention of the number of championships but it's before the 2008 one."
4,Determination at Its Best,"I enjoyed reading this fictionalised slice of history, with it's lesson of sheer determination and a love of learning. It made me want to use my library card to check out Native Son."
3,The ballet is secondary.,This is a book with many types of media tributes to the NYC ballet...if you are looking for a book with illus. devoted to the ballet...you need to look further.
4,Works great with FreeBSD/JReceiver,I have four of these being served by JReceiver on a FreeBSD 5.0 box. Two are on a CAT5-wired network while two are using Netgear XE102 powerline/ethernet bridges. My only complaint is the display size; it's too small. It would have been nice to also output the display to video. I rip all of my CDs to a big disk on the FreeBSD box. These are also exported using Samba so all the Windows boxes can use it as well. I think the Rio Receiver is a great product for the money.
2,Much better as a book,"This lifeless adaptation of the classic children's book is only notable as one of Chuck Jones few feature efforts. Just try not to fast forward as Milo drives back and forth changing from cartoon to real. We get it already! The songs are extremely dated, but if you like the choral style of the late 60s, you might get a grin out of ""What's to Become of Milo."""
2,Chuck in Wackyland,"You can easily imagine how Norton Juster's whimsical, punning, and perfectly logical book might have appealed to Chuck Jones; his adaptation of Juster's ""The Dot and the Line"" had won an Oscar. Parts of this occasionally doleful transfer are effective, and the vocal talent is impeccable: Mel Blanc, Hans Conreid, June Foray. But the musical score is almost unbelievably poor (Leonard Maltin's capsule review refers to the songs as ""icky""), the character designs pale in comparison with the nifty pen-and-inks Jules Feiffer drew for Juster's book, and Jones's Milo runs his hand through his forelock so often you want to break his wrist. Worth seeing, for Juster's admirers and Chuck Jones fanatics. But only once."
3,Phantom Tollbooth DVD (Remastered),"The producers have tried to make the DVD a semi-musical. While it pretty much follows the trip taken in the book, it lacks all the wit and magic that make the book so enchanting. In fairness, perhaps it would be more fun for very young kids - mine are grown now, though, so I couldn't test that hypothesis."
4,What I ThinK About The Product,"Its One of the best movies about that Category (Educational) that I have seen in My Life, the only thing that I don't understand, its why did'nt send me the movie whit subtitles or audio in Spanish, cause I buy it for my 3 years son and thats the reason for my buy. I have the movie in spanish in Beta Format but is to old and is damage.If somebody can offer me this movie in Spanish, please tell me."
1,Wouldn't play,"I wanted to watch this movie so badly since I hadn't seen it since childhood only to find out I couldn't watch this DVD in any of the players in my house due to the special protection and encoding they used to create the disc. And to top it off, when I returned it to Amazon, I was charged a restocking fee!"
2,Phantom Tollbooth dvd ripped,"Was very disappointed that this ""DVD"" was a copied DVD and not the official release of the movie. Thankfully I was at least able to watch it, but still I don't want this and wouldn't recommend this purchase to anyone."
2,Chuck had lost his fastball by then,"I agree with some others here: The book is so good that this cheapo adaptation can't compare. And yes, the songs are dreadful. I have to dock it an extra star (down from 3) because the source material should have yielded a better film. But I really do think Chuck Jones was just mailing it in by then."
1,Terrible Movie,"I remember the REAL version of this as a child, what is this remastered garbage? Where is the Valley of Silence, the Island of Conclusions? The half boy.... so much left out, so much forgotten!I want my money back, what a waste of time."
2,READ THE BOOK,"I first read this book in sixth grade. When I saw the movie title in the TV guide I was thrilled. My favorite book was on video now and I would see it. When I saw it it was devistating. It missed some of the most explanatory scenes of why they went to Digitopolis. I understand that this movie would be wonderful if you haven't read the book but if you read the book it is more colorful, cheerful and funny.If you ask me this movie isn't worth seeing (if you've read the book).Summary:Don't see the movie if you've read the book."
2,A valuable lesson,"I read the Phantom Tollbooth as a 4th grader, soon after it came out, and it was my favorite book. When the movie came out I rushed to see it, and it was the first time I""d seen a movie that had been made from a book I""d read. I was bitterly disappointed. The movie is a failed adaptation of the book. It taught me a valuable lesson- reading a book is always better than watching a movie.Fast forward 30 years and this book is now my son's favorite. He's dying to see the movie, and will learn the same lesson- movies can never come close to creating the world that books allow us to enter."
1,As Distant Experience from the Book as Possible,"""The Phantom Tollbooth"" is one of my favorite books. I like the text. Very unusually for a children's book, I genuinely like the illustrations -- to the extent that I'd consider hanging a few on my wall. It's a distinctive book, and it has hugely valuable object lessons for children. So I had high expectations, paying to see it in a theater. They were completely dashed. The animation is weak standard fare -- a cold shock, compared to the excellence of the book illustrations. The book in some way cleverly holds the narrative together, the movie is a bunch of disjointed, cheezy, cheap cartoon shots. Director Chuck Jones did the same thing to Walt Kelly's ""Pogo"" -- enraging Kelly to such an extent that Kelly took control of the next Pogo film. Jones is a myopic Hollywood talent, seeing only his vision. What is deep in the book is superficial in this movie. The movie is disappointing and bland commercialism."
3,A Gift for my Son,"My 6 year old son loves this movie. We saw it on video back when we had a VCR, and he has been asking when it will come out on DVD.I was happy to see that it finally had. When I first decided to purchase this DVD, the price on Amazon was $17.70. I put it in my cart to purchase for later. Amazon must have discovered that it was the 50th anniversary of the book, because they jacked the DVD price up to over $24.00. I didn't want my son to be disappointed. I didn't really want to spend nearly $25.00. That is why I bought this movie from Walmart."
5,The Phantom Tollbooth,It would be great if this could be made available in DVD. I read the book when I was young and now my son has read the book and loves the movie.
2,No subtitles!,"I got this movie for my godson (who is hearing impaired) just to find out that there are NO closed captions. I remember that the VHS I watched as a kid having CC, why would they put out a sub-par version out on DVD? Other than that, I'm very happy they put it on DVD."
2,Not like I remembered,"I remember watching this as a kid, so after reading the book (which is great!) to our kids, we bought the video. It's different, scarier, than the book. It's got a few cute things in it that our girls enjoyed, but we all preferred the book."
5,The Phantom Tollbooth,Received in a very timely fashion and in excellent shape. Students will be excited to see it in September when they return from summer vacation.
5,Phantom Toll Booth Review.,"I saw this film over 30yrs. ago and I still think that it is a wonderful movie. Not only does it inspire young minds it also lets you in on what was to happend 41 years down the liine. The now harmless meaning children are not using their minds for other things than computers or video games.Thanks so muchCarol Pannell-Henderson1900 Snows Mill AveApt. 507Northport, AL 35476"
5,Simply Remarkable,"J Marie Darden has done it again!! Along with her first book, this one has originality, great characters, and an excellent story line. The author portrays the characters in her book so well I forget that it is fictional. This book will definitely keep you entertained."
3,Not as Good as the first,Great read. But does not compare to the first series. Dignity confused me with her relationship with her white boyfriend and his best friend. There was too many stories that began in this book that just wasn't needed. But still a good read.
5,Excellent Read!,"the book had a lot of twists and turn and surprises, but it was better than the first one and i liked that one to. it was easy to like dignity and to want her and her boyfriend to stick thingss out. i liked the characters and the plot. excellent beach book!"
5,Best courtroom tv show of all time,"I was a kid when I started watching this show in the 80s. The show inspired me to go to law school and become a lawyer. ""The Practice"" comes in a close second. I hope the studios release the DVD soon."
1,Discontinued???,How can this DVD be discontinued BEFORE it's released??Why isn't this series on DVD yet? What's taking so long?
5,Will 2012 be the year one of my favorite all time shows comes out on DVD?,"I can think of very few shows left that I want to own. LA Law is one of the final shows I want in my collection. Why has it taken so long? Even if it is just a season or two (like Hill Street Blues, another Stephen Bochco series) I could take that. But nothing after all these years? I can't be the only one who appreciated this semi-classic drama. By the looks of the other reviews, I'm not. It's reportedly being released in England next year, but not the U.S? Can't anyone involved (Bochco, Hamlin, Smits, Dey, etc.) step up and help the fans of this great show?"

2,Decidedly unimpressive,"This is an inoffensive and easy enough to read biography - in fact I can't imagine it straining anyone's intelligence at all - but as a piece of scholarly research it's very third rate. The research methods are slapdash and often rather dodgy (at one point the author flatly states that a certain poem was sent to Samuel Bowles, merely because in the transcript made after Dickinson's death the poem was headed with his name, even though there's no such heading on the manuscript form written by Emily) - and the portrait drawn of the poet is rather pallid and ordinary. Sympathetic, but quite simplistic."
2,They hurt my feet,Looks ok. Insole is poorly cushioned. I bought these about a month ago: store was out of stock on ashtons (discontinued?) Now looking for something else. Not recommended.
5,Great Samples of Wonderful Lyrics,"The Samples has a unique sound. The remind me of an underground R.E.M. I cannot believe they are given 2 out of 5 stars. When you play ""Weight of the World"" or ""Did You Ever Look So Nice"" from start to finish, you want to hit replay. While ""Birth of Words"" doesn't have the best melody, the lyrics are pretty good and tell a story which is already better than what most songs do. There is no ""sexual"" content of their lyrics - it is not rated R like most modern music. They are simple and they are giving you a sample of what they do best. Write lyrics and create strangely unique melodies. Other awesome songs by them are ""Little Silver Ring"", ""Waited Up"" and ""The Streets in the Rain"". Don't judge until you hear it all."
2,Culmination,"The Samples took the best of 80's music and made it their own. In fact, their music is the culmination of global art finding a comfortable nexus on humanity's terms. They were the sum of manufactured genres and a testament to something beyond that status quo. They took soul, reggae, folk, rock, bluegrass, etc., wrapped it up, and went after it! During the 20th century, media brought the world together in a way person-kind had never known. The Samples helped solidify that reality. This music moves beyond the arbitrary classifications that human beings find pleasure in. In fact, this band was a manifestation of the beautiful things than can happen when humans see past difference. Music can, in an era of ringtones hits, still mean that much. It's up to us to place it in a broader context."
3,Very impressed - better than LL Bean Slippers (updated),Slippers seem nice and very well made.....they wear better and look better than my LL Bean slippers (I love LL Bean but their slippers never seem to last). I thought LB Evans was a take off on LL Bean but instead...seems like a high end brand (they are sold at Nordstroms). Highly recommendMy original post is above......but now its just a few months later and the inside is falling apart....now i'm sad (and need new slippers). ugh...
3,OK for the price,"This slipper is OK for the price, I WISH it was available in 1/2 sizes also. The slipper is light and comfortable, but only suitable for LIMITED use outside."
5,son lives in them,My son wears his soled slippers ALL the time. He found this pair very comfortable and likes the darker color.
5,You get what you pay for!,"When shopping for slippers, I considered at least 6 different ones. I even found one pair that had regular price of $29.99 and were on 1/2 price sale. For that I could have purchased 3 pairs for the same amount that I paid for these.........I'm so glad I bought the Darren slippers. They are 10 times better that the less expensive ones and I would recommend these to anyone."
1,"Comfortable, but defective","I bought these for my husband for Christmas and he thought they were great, very comfortable, good fit, didn't slip off his heels. But in less than a month, the lining of the toe area of BOTH slippers fell apart, noticed when small pieces of the foam lining were coming out. Very disappointing for what we thought was a nice high quality slipper."
5,They are warm,"They are a nice addition to the casual closet, you can wear them with jeans. I wear them to school when I just want to chill out and feel relax."
5,warm and cozy,A Christmas gift for my husband. He loves that his feet are warm and toasty w/out feeling hot and smelly!
2,Slippers,My husband found the heel area to be too wide and foot kept coming out...returned them. Nothing very special anyway.

1,Laughable,Laughable and over-priced collection of copy & pasted facts available off any Wikipedia site. Don't waste your time with this.
4,"Important topic, well written, but...","I believe that Dr. Spaite and Ms. Salter, conceptually have a very good topic here. The number of clergy leaving the field is staggering. The author and contributor, however do place some unrealistic expectations on the shoulders of the pastor. One area, which should have received more attention is that of pastoral salaries. While their treatment of the psychological aspects of burnout and tension in the parsonage was sympathetic, only about one paragraph in 300 pages of work dealt with the very real problem of paying the bills while serving God."
3,"Interesting book, but...","The book was quite interesting, and kept my attention all the way through. It has some of the best dialogue I've read in a long time. The problem with it is that most of the characters are morally bankrupt jerks. The two likeable people in the story, Rudy and his grandfather, are hardly even in it. The rest of the people are really hard to care about. Aaron, Rudy's parents, Branch and his mother, Jenny and Charley, and even Walt are all portrayed as either cruel and manipulative, whiny and spoiled, or weak and masochistic. You really just don't care when something bad happens to them because they don't deserve to have anything GOOD happen. But, a lot of books are like that, so if you want is a well written novel that keeps your interest, this is definitely one of those. If you're looking for a novel with characters you'll identify with and care about, look elsewhere."
3,Sex and nostalgia,"I recently re-read Boys and Girls Together to see if it was as good as I remembered. When I first read it in 1969 or '70 I was impressed with the way Goldman structured the story. Each chapter was a separate story with a new protagonist, but as the book progressed the stories came together, the unrelated characters who we first see as children or students grow up, move to New York and meet one another, and their lives become intertwined. Back then I thought that was an ingenuous way of structuring a plot. I was also titillated by the many sex scenes, much in the way the whole world had been titillated by books such as Peyton Place and The Valley of the Dolls. Now, 40 years later, I was surprised at how well it has retained it's impact. It may not be as revolutionary as it once was, but it is still a highly entertaining novel."
4,teenager,I remembered this book from my teenager years. It was a good read the second time and would make a good movie even now
2,On...and on....and ON...,"This book lies halfway completed on my friend's dresser. I can't bear to pick it up again.It starts out fairly interesting, with lots of quirky characters and intriguing plot lines. That's for the first 300 pages. That, in my opinion, could have been the whole book. However, it continues for over 400 more pages, with the same people, getting more and more complicated with each turn of the page. To be honest, I simply got lost. I couldn't remember who dated whom, who hated whom, and who...Oh, forget it.Now, I read books, I read lots of books...And I got lost. I gave up, around page 450. But, I tend to read books that have a few base characters whose lives are built upon chapter by chapter. This book does that, tenfold. If you think you can keep up and stay interested, go for it. It IS well written and interesting, it just seemed like I'd have to start taking notes as I read. No, thank you."
2,Didn't read past page 725,"I picked up this book since it was discounted and by William Goldman (Princess Bride being a favorite book and movie), so it was on a whim... I thought it looked interesting with lots of dialogue between characters - which is a style that I usually like. Until I started reading it and realized that this book was ONLY dialogue and that was used as much as a crutch than to tell a real story. All the characters are grating and annoying and the dialogue is contrived. So when I finally got to page 725 of page 751 I just stopped the insanity and decided to quit then and there since the extra 20 minutes seemed better spent elsewhere than reading about these characters. There is better out there."
5,Wonderful Read,"My dog eared copy of this book disappeared over 10 years ago. I can't wait to get my hands on another copy and revisit these people. If you haven't read it and enjoy a book with excellent character development, and can find a copy, get it. And, if you get it, let me know from where."
1,faulty product,"I could not play this DVD on both my DVD machines, I had to return it. I will say that the return process was quick and smooth tough--which is great from an internet company."
2,Low Quality Production,I wasn't thrilled about the production quality of this DVD. I was expecting something more professional but most of it is shot in a room and it looks quite amateur. I wouldn't recommend.
4,Needs the Right Mood,"Troy Donockley & Dave Bainbridge from the Celtic folk jazz rock group ""Iona"" were given a chance to play their instruments in the Lincoln Cathedral using a Binaural stereo technique. The sound engineer Dallas Simpson used a custom designed in-ear microphone to create a 3 dimension surround sound in real time. This CD is suppose to sound at its best using headphones. The music is rather free flowing with mystical Celtic overtones but something reminded me of a Mark Isham theme from the movie ""Mrs. Soffel"" staring Mel Gibson & Diane Keaton. Yes, its that Irish tin whistle sounding like blowing wind. The CD hasn't grabbed me yet, maybe because I can't find a special time of quiet listening these days, but the talent & engineering are unquestionable. There also is a video DVD version that just came out that I haven't seen. Keep an eye out for these two artists."
5,Fisher Price baby gym,I bought this item for my son who was 6 months old at the time. From the time I assembled it and he saw it his eyes lit up. When I placed him on the mat he immediately began stretching to grap whatever toys he could. It was wonderful to see him having fun and also proving money well spent. This gym kept him active and occupied. He loved the musical puppy the most. he was fascinated by the ways the lights flickered on and off. I recommend this product for any parent wishing to introduce something new to their new borns.
5,Just Perfect!!,"Fisher-Price Songs & Smiles Discovery GymMy Grandson in nearly 6 months old and he just loves it. As he gets a little older I am sure he will enjoy it even more. My daughter likes it too, it keeps him busy and happy!!"
2,Not good quality,"I bought this play gym based on the picture and thought it looked really nice. When it arrived it was poor quality and the bars that go across the top are so flimsy that if the mat is moved at all they collapse. I would not recommend this play gym, I had to buy another one since this one was not safe for baby. I bought a Tiny Love 3-D play gym and I would highly recommend it instead!"
3,The Real World Las Vegas,"It was ok... nothing spectacular...you seen one Real world, you basicall seen them all... made up fights, made up sex, made up ..."
2,Why this season?!,"While I admire Bunim-Murray's releasing of an entire Real World season, why release Las Vegas right away? With the first season on DVD, wouldn't it make more sense to release the classic seasons like Los Angeles and San Francisco first? Plus, releasing Las Vegas right on the heels of its finale seems silly. As if we aren't already sick of that gang to begin with!"
2,why now???,"ok here is the scoop, i live by the real world &road rules i own all the real world movies. now im only 12 so when the 1st season came out i was only 1 & it was great when the whole season came out becaouse i could see what i had missed. so usually they should go with the 2nd season(L.A.) to put out on dvd, and if you want to put out a whole season you should at least put out a season that was good. i mean that season bored me to death!!!"
1,Is it uncensored?,"Is it unsencensored? Do they shows the nude parts,cause i want to know if they censored the profantity,did they censored it?"
1,You gotta be kidding,"realeasing this before the classics is absurd This group was the phoniest most unlikeable. Watching the Real World since the 1st season this is the first time i stopped watching because the cast was soooo overly dramatic, and looking constantly for attention, and forever complaining and arguing but at the end the usual ""We love each other so much"" lie.Gimme a break!"
4,Give it a chance,I thought this would be pretty bad since it was primarily a covers album. I really enjoyed it and thought he did a great job with these songs. Will listen to this many times.
3,A bit disapointed,"I had high expectation for this album, i guess my expectation was far higher than the actual album.I was expecting a metal explosion of the mind to what I received about buying Josh Todd's You Made Me.If your expecting a heavy sounding Quiet Riot you will be disappointed.More listening has helped ease the ears to this album, a few good songs towards the end.A average album from a metal legend."
3,Car wash bucket,"The bucket I recieved was nothing like the photo advertised, it is just a plain round bucket slightly better than the quality of a Dollar store bucket."
5,Absolutely Gorgeous album!,"Being a huge fan of Queen, I just had to get this live album! when i first listened to it, I thought it was amazing! Freddie's vocals are as usual, superb and Roger, Brian and John do their usual, spectacular job. the songs are all very well done, the quality is good, and, well, overall, it is a wonderful album, and a treasure to any collector!"
2,When a studio group plays live,"Queen was a great band in the studio, esp. when they had a great produced like R.T.Baker. Trying to interpret multi-tracked vocals live just doesn't work as evidenced here. Oh yes, they TRY and are able to pull off a passable performance, but it really doesn't do the material justice. Stick to the studio discs and revel in how great they sounded. This is for competeists only"
3,So so...,"Yeah, well when I first got this one, I was kind of taken aback. A slap in the face I guess you could say. Queen kinda disappointed me with this little number. The sound isn't really that clear and there's this one annoying part where Freddie swears and its beeped out really loudly...almost made me deaf. I am an avid Queen fan and a big supporter, but if you're looking for a good concert recording, try Live at Wembley '86. There's a beaut!"
4,Simply awsome,the best of the queen's live cds. The band sounds awsome while live. The only thing that would of madde it really good would be better songs on the cd. And freddie mercury dosent sound that differnt in most of the songs.
3,Are you ready to rock? Are you ready to roll?,"This was Queen's first live album. It was recorded at various venues during their European tour of January, February and March of 1979. It is a good document of what Queen sounded like live at the time. But none of the songs sound as good as their studio counterparts. Still, most Queen fans will probably enjoy it."
4,"Queen was really more a 'live' group than a ""radio"" group.","This album sounds as good as the best live albums. Why? Because it's one of the best one!'Don't stop me now','killer queen', 'We will rock you' ( of course... ) sounds as if they were written for live performances. Queen musicians knew how to use the studio tools but they also knew how to entertain an audience! Freddy Mercury makes the audience sing in such an emotionnal way that he shows how deeply he involves himself in the concert. Bryan May is perfect, John Deacon plays the right note when you don't expect it and Roger Taylor keep the beat.Listen to it, it deserves it !"
3,They bleep the swearing ?,Is this the way it was recorded ? There are long very annoying bleeps a couple times when freddie curses . Is this the only way to hear this great live cd or was it censored for the cd in 1991 ?
5,Addicted,I'm looking forward to my next Queen purchase in 2 or 3 weeks.Two or three I'll buy another. Can't wait
4,Worth Picking Up,"Overall, this is a fine album. It offers fresh, energetic performances of Queen playing live in the 70's. It's interesting to hear how Queen sounds live without all the studio overdubbingthe band did on their studio albums."
5,Queen rocks the venues in Europe,"""Live Killers"" is Queen's first live album and contains most of their classic songs from the 70's (""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Keep Yourself Alive"", ""We Will Rock You"" and ""We are the Champions"" just to mention a few) and gives us a feeling of being at one of their many concerts they played. The mood of the album is good and the band's playfulness shows off several times, like in ""Now I'm Here"" when Freddie starts to do a vocal competition with the audience and the sing-along part when the audience becomes a vital part of the show as they sing along with the Boys. If you like to listen to entertaining live shows, then this is your natural choice."
3,"A real ""killer""","Queen's first live release, this double album encompasses their European tour of that year and is arguably, the peak of their live power.This offers the only officially released rendition of ""We Will Rock You""-Fast Version and is suitably the opener.Though Roger has publicly denounced the album's poor mix, to me it shows how ""raw"" they could be.True, there are better live versions of these tracks to be found elsewhere, for an official release, it's not bad. A notable exception is ""Spread Your Wings"", as a studio track, it's lame but on here, Freddie brought about a sadness in his singing...a man who dreamt of something more and Brian's soaring guitar solo only amplifies this emotion.The three ""bleeps"" at the beginning of ""Death On Two Legs"" were a direct result of the lawsuit by their former manager as Freddie called him something rather nasty.Certainly not a brilliant release, it satisfies the need for live material for their fans."
5,The very best of Queen!,"If you like their medleys where they cleverly blend on song into the next and do it with the high energy they gave during concerts, you need this CD. These songs are the reason their career went on for as long as it did, they were written and played at the band's prime. It's also great to hear Freddie play with the audience, it really makes you wish you were there. Instead, take the next best thing- invest in this album and you won't be sorry."
3,"Great idea, but need more improvement.","When I first saw The Brunton ""FlipSticks"" Folding Chopsticks, I told to myself that I have to buy it. It arrived in about a week, the idea is very good, however the folding chopsticks wasn't as good as I expected. First the bamboo stick is not too strong, in my personal opinion I think the company should use plastic instead of bamboo. Second the metal area is too wide, making it very difficult to hold the chopsticks. The company should make it thinner, so that it will fit better between fingers. Overall, I think this is a good idea. I just hope the company will have some improvement on their second version."
2,Nothing special,"I recently bought nearly every pair of travel chopsticks I could find online. I was excited about using these due to their unique look, but they did disappoint. The pivot point in the middle gets in the way making them comfortable to use in exactly one position. This makes it very difficult to eat out of a take out box because you can't get a good grip on the metal parts. Also putting them down and picking them up takes just that much more time because you have grip them just so to actually use them."
5,los chavalles de espana cd,"Excellent - arrived as promised and I would purchase again from this vendor. The CD was sharp, and brought back many fond memories of this group. Thank you."
3,OK,"I am surprised at the rave reviews. I was looking for something to replace the delightful taste of Trader Joe's duchess Tea, which has been discontinued. This actually taste somewhat artificial to me-it has a very strong smell.. Hard to place.. I think what is wrong with it is that this tea has a sort of creamy vanilla thing going on that is similar to that creamy stuff in it swirled strawberry cream candy-doesn't taste like cream, just tastes weird. But it's all right when I'm in a fix and the box is darned beautiful"
2,"Very little harp, frustrating to listen to. BIG disappointment.","I bought this CD in an effort to reduce my son's stress when doing schoolwork/homework. I was very happy to have found a cd that was *supposedly* relaxing with lovely harp music. What I got was a basic classical/easy listening cd. In one song I wasn't even able to hear harp music. The first song on the cd has a rather obnoxious beat to accompany it. If you've ever enjoyed listening to true harp music, and know the calming and soothing effect it has on nerves, this cd will be a huge disappointment. I can only assume that the other reviewers who listed 5 stars are not used to good quality harp music."
2,not what was pictured,I ordered this because it shows Thomas as the train that comes with the video but I got a different train. It's the right video and my son likes it - but not Thomas the Train
2,Double Train?,"Haven't watched the DVD yet, Christmas present, but it DOES NOT have a double train as it says in the description. It is as pictured. Amazon needs to correct this."
5,Thomas just keeps on pushing!,"Like all the Thomas programs, this one delights the grandchildren endlessly! Interesting stories, characters, music and songs."
2,Not well written,"Don't get me wrong, there are many things I really liked about this little book. I loved getting a sort of year-in-the-life perspective, and the detail is good. But the writing is stilted and character development non-existant. I think the author has some interesting things to say, but he could have used a lot more help from his editors!"
2,Catwoman Costume - not the best quality,"I bought this costume, and I don't like it even a fraction of how much I like the one I made myself out of stuff I had around the house. Some places are too tight, and others are not tight enough. The only part I actually like is the mask, and it isnt even that great. I wish it were made of some other material, so it would be shiny like in the movie. I am really disappointed in this product."
5,Catwoman in the Cold,"I loved seeing it and ordering it. When it came in it was a bit complicated in where and to lace the belt. The mask runs a bit tight on the head and I don't have a very big head to begin with. It was easy to get in, out, and it was comfy and warm with us standing outside handing candy to children in the cold and wind. But I would recommend this for a simple costume for Halloween"
5,The Perfect Cook Book for Non Readers!,"I operate a non-profit program, Canyon Verde, for adults who are diagnosed with developmental disabilities. There are few ""ready made"" materials that are appropriate for our clients, so my staff creates most of our learning curriculum. I was thrilled to find a visual cookbook, as we teach our clients basic cooking skills in our kitchen. The step-by-step guide is not only good for the adults we serve, but I also see it as a useful tool for any person who is challenged as a cook.It is a ""make no mistake"" cook book and will be put to good use! Thank you for this great product!!"
4,"An excellent how-to book, but not for beginners","This book primarily makes use of different types of modeling wax to create everything from small scars to bullet holes to disembowelments. I bought it for myself, but found it to be too advanced--I am more of a Halloween make-up sort of person. My co-owner, Cat, is an expert in theatrical makeup, and finds it an excellent guide, well worth poring over. So, if you're like me, keep looking; if you have a background in makeup and want to learn more about horror moulage, this is for you."
4,Only wish it were a little bigger...,"I teach a make up class and this is great for overall instruction. The kids enjoy this section of the class, so I was very happy with it."
4,Great For Beginners,"I am a film student who needed to learn the basics of special effects makeup very quickly. This particular book did a great job of laying out some fundamentals of the makeup world. The book is organized into different effects, which if you only take at face value is limited. However, if you go through and read each effect that is being taught you will quickly realize that the book isn't a specific how-to for each effect, but rather an organized method to teach the fundamentals. For example, even if you don't need ""monster hands"", the chapter on making them is really just a great introduction into how to use latex on a medium scale.Overall, this is a great resource for the beginner who wants to being learning the fundamentals of special effects makeup. It will certainly get your gears spinning and allow you to start thinking of how you can apply the different techniques it provides."
3,What about the rest???,"This book has a lot of great information, but the instructions are not as clear as they could be. There is a a ""materials"" section, but then the instructions don't always explain when to use all the materials. I have experience doing this type of make-up, so it was easy enough to figure out, but I would be much harder for a beginner."
3,Good Starting Point,"I have been doing some makeup at home for years. I'm not a professional, so this book had some good tips and tricks. There could be more sections on various creatures, and less on how to make things like fake hands and eyes. I feel that most people will buy those types of items, but will want to do more of the creative makeup part themselves."
4,Astrological Gardening,"Well written book with a ton of information on astrological gardening. Gives a little insight into companion gardening, but I would not buy solely for that purpose."
1,"COBY CTV-101 9"" TV","Coby CTV-101 9"" Color TVI wouldn't even think about buying this piece of junk, based the preceeding 4 reviews."
1,Does not fit Samsung SGH-I717 properly,"The inner silicone sleeve doesn't properly fit the phone and neither does the hard outer back plate, constantly unclipping and falling off. There is no way to securely affix it in place. Raised button covers are not properly positioned over the actual buttons therefore they don't work... Too bad, it looks great, however it just doesn't work."
1,DON'T DO IT!!!,i bought this thinking it would be good protection for my note (AT&T version)....WRONG! This thing barely fit my phone and the plastic part always fell off because of it...gave it one star because of the shipping. If not id give this product no stars!
5,A must have for the Kerry Livgren collector,"This album demonstrates Kerry Livgren's masterful songwriting talent. In a departure from the ""Kansas sound"", Livgren explores new musical territory, while continuing to give voice to his Christian spirituality. If you're a fan of rock music artistry, you must get this album. It will definately reach out and touch your soul."
2,A different direction for Kerry Livgren,"The music on this album sounds nothing like Kansas, nor for that matter like Kerry Livgren's first solo album _Seeds of Change_. _Time Line_ is pure 80's rock a-la bands like Survivor and Night Ranger, with little of the progressive rock direction that Livgren brought to Kansas during the 70's. While some of the music here is pretty good, it isn't great; the symphonic element that made Kansas such a great band is gone. The lyrics here are also problematic. Unlike the Christian lyrics on _Seeds of Change_, which reflect mainstream Christianity and the excitement of a new convert in a positive, uplifting manner, the lyrics here are of a more negative, oppositional nature and veer into Christian Reconstructionist sentiments all too often, with jabs taken at the ""secular"" media and the New Age movement. The vocals on this album are performed by Warren Ham, who was the vocalist on the last two albums by the early 70's band Bloodrock."
2,"I like it, I like it!","Kerry Livgren has certainly proved that he is a talented writer as well as being a versatile musician. I have seen Kansas a few times and was always impressed by his quality of playing live. I was sorry to see him split from the band but he hasn't lost a single step. The writing is still quality and he has surrounded himself with top notch players. The only thing missing was Steve Walsh's vocal ability. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this to any music lover."
2,I'm not scared of these spiders,"Synopsis:The noviization of the Speliberg film. A photagrafor is bitten by a mysterious new species of spider while exploring in South America. The photagrafor's body is then sent back to his home town with the spider in tow. Once there the spider mates with a common house spider and creates a whole nest of homicidal spiderlings.Grade:C-Review:The movie was medocre at best and this is no diffrent. It reads like a third grade book report of the movie, and the plot makes little to no sense. The fact of the matter is tis is a 50 minute read that will leave you with a sickly sense of time wasted.Recommendations: no one except maybe a 3rd grader that liked the movie.Cost: I wouldn't spend more than 3 bucks on this book."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Spiders can really be quite useful.Not when there are thousands thousands of really rather oversized specimens trying to kill you and everyone around you, however.Or, standard sort of bug horror plot, one hundred percent.With a tiny bit of comedy relief here and there.If you really like spiders destroying humans, you certainly should get this one."
3,Song From the Sorority Bathroom,"I don't actually own this cd, but in response to a previous reviewer's question, the name of the song playing when Evan is walking to the bathroom in the sorority house is called ""My Elastic Eye"" by The Chemical Brothers."
3,PimpC's Review,"The movie was great, and all the instrumental music on the soundtrack is emotional and makes it a great soundtrack. In my opinion this is one of the best movies in a long time. However, the song that i wanted is after even fixes everything and is walking as an adult years later and sees kayle. For anyone that wants to know that song is by Oasis, its called cry for you or crying for you (Ive seen it labled as both names). If you saw the movie and liked it, then the soundtrack is a good choice also. Any comments? pimpc1125@aol.com peace!"
2,Name of Song,"The name of the song from the scene of Evan and Kayle in bed is ""Alone Again and"" By Departure Lounge from the ""Too Late to Die Young"" cd. I am always disappointed when I go to buy the soundtrack because I loved the music from the movie, just to find that it is a score; not the original songs. I listened to the soundtrack however but wasn't impressed; maybe because I wanted to hear the songs instead. If the soundtrack is good; I must be missing something as I didn't like it."
2,song title,"hi all i love this movie but i want this song on the movie so bad but it is not on the soundtrack can someone please help meits the song when him and the girl are in college and he surprises her with dinner, the song say ""i never said thank you for that "" please help thank youdevine"
3,"Good score, but left out some movie's better moments...","I'm highly disappointed with the fact that this OST only includes the original instrumental score.Many of the more powerful musical moments in the film were actually provided by many of the movie's non-original songs-- none of which were included on this soundtrack.To be fair, the score is actually quite good.It covers a full range of emotions, and is very well arranged. Its right up there with ""Amelie"" and ""Donnie Darko"" as one of the better motion picture scores in my collection.Its not, however, a full representation of the movie itself.I remember leaving the theater thinking to myself, ""I've gotta buy that soundtrack"".Reconsider purchasing this album if you thought the same thing..."
4,Go back in time and don't buy the CD,"Listen folks, it can be much more difficult contractually to put together a soundtrack album than you think. And unless this is the first soundtrack you've ever looked at, you'd know that most do not include every song that's played in a movie...particularly snippets. In the Internet age, it's plain stupid not to look online and see the song list and the artist: in this case, an accreditation to Michael Suby. If you bought the CD in-person without reading the tracks, then you're really dim.Mr. Suby produced a score that worked well in the movie and stands alone just fine. A worthwhile purchase."
3,Name of the very last song,Does anyone know the name of the song playing when Evan and Kayleigh are walking in NY and are all grown up?
3,Song playing during sorority bathroom scene,I am trying to figure out the title and artist of the song playing when aston walks into the sorority bathroom with the bloody nose. Its got a lot of deep bass. Any help is greatly appreciated
3,Track 15 is totally from another movie!,"I don't own this soundtrack but I just watched the movie and track 15 - Sorority Strut - is from the movie ""The Fog"" with music composed by John Carpenter. It's not the exact same, different instrumentation and such, but the riff is exactly the same. Listen to track 2 on ""The Fog"" soundtrack and you'll see what I mean."
3,name the song,ok...if my elastic eye is the song from the sorority bathroom..then..what song is playing like...3 minutes and a half afterwards..when kayleigh and evan are back in her dorm at the sorority house..and the phone rings...i couldn't find it ..not even on the soundtrack listed on the internet movie database..or maybe i just don't know it s title and that's why
4,"Haunting Score, resonates after viewing ...","As is proving customary these days, a lot of overlooked genre films are delivering the best OSTs around. The real gem on this album is ""Kayleigh's Funeral"" which sets up the plot directly in the film and just evokes this raw sentimental power behind it. Really moving."
1,"not the actual SOUNDTRACK, bot the SCORE","i was disappointed to not find the final song on this cd. Reading other reviews, so were many people. What you ARE looking for is: OASIS ""Stop crying your heart out"" It is on the album "" Heathen Chemistry"""
2,Amazing.,"No, no no, I'm not amazed in a good way. I am amazed at how the listing for benefit of the soundtrack titles fall so steeply short of expectations and actually that's why I'm writing. I see by other reviews I am not the only one disappointed.Well, here's one example: I am trying to find a song that plays during a part in the movie. We have on the CD, ""Evan Kills Tommy"" which in my opinion the few bars or piece sounds like any other event on any movie anywhere, but there's no hint of the one captivating piece of soundtrack which is the reason I bothered to look up the score to this movie in the very first place.Thankfully a previous reviewer knew. I didn't buy this soundtrack because that song was not on it. That song, in case anyone cares, is Alone Again and, by Departure Lounge. Thank you thank you thank you to the previous reviewer for solving the mystery for me!"
2,complete but boring overview of Yunnan,"I bought this video in preparation to a trip to Yunnan and it did provide a fairly comprehensive overview of the main sights of the province. However I found it a bit boring. The photography is plain, rather a sequence of standard shoots of touristy spots. Very little human life, nothing of the real life of the people of the province. There is no spoken commentary, but only a local music soundtrack, which I found a bit repetitive. A little booklet in Chinese and English does provide additional information, but not really anything that you would not find on any guidebook that any tourist is going to buy. Video quality is average."
5,Breathtaking Film,"A breathtaking film, very well directed, great screenplay and the performances very well balance. Jsu Garcia as Tavo give a knockout performance he had touched an extraordinary range of emotional chords as a desperate guy that wants a better future. Good chemistry between him and Madeleine Stowe as Marina. The love between Tavo and Marina is what keeps the characters alive to what they had to face. There is tension in this film that is builds by both lead actors, This was a very intense film about innocent people that are used by the power of money."
3,Good effort but too short!,"Garcia, Madeline Stowe and David Carradineare outstanding in here, but Carradine asdrug lord? With his reported past problems?Risky...Comes off well but too short andtoo concise. Modest budget at least didn'thurt here. Look for Stowe in 'Last of TheMohicans', too!"
5,awesome,"This books got it all, I didn't know there were THAT many deities! Definately a must have for any witch/pagan/coven...or anyone who wants to know anything about any deity."
1,"Save your money, I'd give it ZERO stars if I could.","I don't know WHAT book the previous reviewers read, but it obviously WAS not, and COULD not have been the same.First, the book is a small 8"" X 5"" in size with 157 pages. 157 pages of LARGE type and many that are half filled.(several are totally blank) The beginning 50 pages are a joke in self help exercises and nutrition. Pushups anyone?? Oh, PLEASE!!!! All in all this book condensed would fill at most 75 pages.Ahhh, they say you don't pay for size, but rather the information contained within! Sorry, it falls WAAAAAAAY short there too. Very, very elementry stuff here folks. You have probably already dreamed most of it up, and if you haven't you should have!!I expected 157 pages FILLED with ""HOT Recipies"". What I got was fodder for my recycle bin. Too bad ...it has a great title! Steer clear of this one. Laura Corns books are a better value. IMO"
5,Great book to put the lust back into any relationship!,It's about time that someone wrote a book that cuts right to the core of sexual relationships. I found this book not to hold back on any punches and gets right to the heart of what is so wonderful about having sex and pleasing your mate. Breakfast in bed will never mean quite the same thing to us anymore. No matter how long you have been with your lover this book will open your eyes to ideas that you may never have realized in the past. Think you having great sex? So did I! Dr Joan Irvine and Jeanne Ernst should have a monument erected somewhere. Thank you for having this book online and you can be sure that we will search for any other collections by these wonderful authors.
4,Dogbreath doesn't know have a romantic bone in his body!,"Recipes for Hot Sex - I found it to be a a light hearted exercise to reinforce and re-ignite the fires that burn within each one of us.These ""chef's"" have put together a list of ingredients that add to the pleasures of making love and being loved. Some of the recipes I'm sure you've thought of, but it makes them worth trying when the two of you need to follow the directions in black and white! I've found that sometimes trying to find that certain spice to heat up your Noche di Amore' can be difficult if you don't know where to look or don't remember. For the mild to the almost wild - there is a great recipe for everyone.This book is truly a great ""coffee table"" book and it is one of my favorite books to give as gifts. My friends have bought it and pass it on to their other friends too!"
3,Wrong size....,"They don't come in sizes so couldn't tell from the info or view that they weren't going to work. Excellent customer service, just unable to use the product."
3,Flickering lights,"Nice and bright, perfect white color to match HID headlights, first set was flickering horribly, and it wasn't the bulb, something loose inside the housing. Got a replacement from Amazon, if no improvement with the flickering it's all going back."
4,A great movie,"This is a wonderful movie. I love Russian films from the mid Soviet period, and this is an excellent one. Great for the technology that was available to them.Anyone who is a student of a Slavic language or looking to delve deeper into their Slavic American heritage will enjoy watching this around the holidays.One thing that prevented me from giving this film the extra * was the English dubbing. I understand most of what they say, and if I don't, I make do with subtitles. A friend insisted on watching the English language version on this disk, and I was very disappointed by the poor quality voice-overs. They don't mute the original Russian speach, but play the English right along with it. In short, it makes it so you can't make out either language, as their playing at the same time.If you could do without hearing it in English, this is a 100% top notch film the whole family will enjoy for years."
4,A Prairie Courtship,The story was very interesting. Parts had to be read over due to the use words of long drawn out describtions. I still found it to be a very good book . I purchased this book for kindle through Amazon. I would consider more books by this author.
5,A new definition of black metal,"If you're looking for pure, aggressive, fast, intense black metal, maybe you should skip this album.If you appreciate black metal that is not afraid to move into quiet and dreadfully ominous periods of song, I'd highly recommend this. 'Lurker of Chalice' combines the discordant and dark sounds of American Black Metal with an even darker ambient feeling. It even goes so far as to incorporate elements of psychedelia.Listen to this album in a quiet place, and I expect you will feel as though you have entered a different world, that you have been transformed into something radically different. It's all just the atmosphere of the album of course, but it achieves perhaps one of the finest atmospheres in black metal."
3,Not the place to start,"I am a huge Lenny Breau fan. That's why I have this DVD. This is very short, only 2 tunes. The MAster Class is a better place to start."
2,Rips too easily,"Opened the package and and at first was somewhat surprised by the hefty thicknessof the Vinyl, and with a soft liner. However when I put it on the grill and GENTLYtried to fasten the Velcro straps at bottom.. Both seams ripped where the Velcro was attached.Actually, I wont say ripped - more like came apart.Also this one seemed to be sized too small.Guess you get what you pay for.I would pass on this one.,.,"
3,Not so good,"this product does not stand up to the wind very well, has rips in it after one week ? could be made of heavier material ?"
2,disappointed,"I recently bought this item and opened it to find that the seams on the sides near the bottom are not sewn properly, so the white padding is exposed,in other words it is damaged. It was not exactly cheap so I am surprised at the quality. As my mom would say..""It looks like it was sewn with a sneeze"". I am not even going to return it now, I hope it lasts for a few months so I can buy a better one elsewhere. Would this item be considered ""seconds""??? The weight of it is sturdy enough so that's why the 2 stars, but why doesn't anyone in their company double check these things...I would say it's bad for business to sell things like this!!"
4,great cover!,"at this price point, this is the best grill cover i've seen. it shipped quick as well. would recommend to anyone in need in this size range."
1,Do not buy,"Please do your self a favor and do not buy this. It is supposed to fit the Broil King 90 Series. It does not fit it,you need to buy a 60"" cover. Even if it had fit it is a thin piece of vinyl that rips very easily. This is the first time I have been disappointed with an item from Amazon and I purchase a lot from them. Surprised at the cheap quality and bad fit as this cover comes from Broil King and the grill is honestly great."
1,Thinnest Plastic Ever,"I bought this cover because it was brought up at the bottom of the page I purchased the grill. The cover at first glance seems nice , the weight seems good but the plastic is the thinnest I have ever seen on a grille cover. If it weren't for the felt backing a slight breeze would tear it apart. The plastic has torn a way from the seams at the threads. The only thing holding it together is the felt backing. I would not recommend this cover to anyone. Please check the gauge of plastic before buying any cover. You get what you pay for. Bought a nice grill but got a cheap cover. If it did not cost so much for shipping I would send it back."
2,Thin and cheap,"I am not sure where some of these product reviews come from. I read the reviews of this grill cover and it sounded pretty good. However, I have owned it for a few months and can tell you that I would never buy it again. This cover is VERY thin and already has holes in it. Just the slightest wear on the corner of the grill has put holes in it. I have pretty much wasted money on this and I know it won't last the rest of the year. I will have to buy another one that is more sturdy.Buy a cover with more heavy-duty material or trust me...you will regret it."
5,"Grillpro 60"" cover",Very quality cover for a low price... durable on the outterlayer and soft on the inner layer. Keeps the grill free from the sun and rain.... and velcro straps on the sides to help keep on if wind kicks up.
1,Rain leaks in through the seams,We recently had a few weeks of rainy spring weather here and I pulled off the grill cover and found puddles of water in the shelfs off my brand new grill. It appears as if the seams lining the top of the cover are not water tight. I'm very disappointed in this product. I am going to try to buy some seam tape to hopefully waterproof it.
5,heavy duty grill cover,We recently purchased a grill cover. What a bueaty. You can tell this is a great quality product. It fit great on our grill and I know we are going to love it. I would reccomend tis product to anyone.
1,be very careful with this item,"when I received the item, I shook out the folds as one would a sheet and the seam ripped almost effortlessly. as the rip was small I decided to put it on the bbq anyway and lo, it completely ripped open about 4 inches even though I exerted almost no effort. I inspected it for defects and found it to just be a cheap poorly made item. spend twice the money and get one made in the USA, its money well spent if you wish to protect your investment."
1,junk,"one wind storm and tore apart! had it for 4 months only a 1 month wrrranty i buy one close by, never had i seen one tear up like this. i had it straped too!"
2,OMC 68in Deluxe Grill Cover 50168,"I paid about $20 for this item and that is about what it is worth. What bothers me is that the seller wants you to believe that he is selling a $70 product for $20. (...""and call now because there are only three remaining..."" if you know what I mean). The cover will do the job but do not expect a $70 value. The word ""Deluxe"" is definitely misleading."
1,Lasted a week,The seem split after a week. Very thin fabric. I would think twice before buying. I need five more words.
2,ok,Lighly built - tore accidently on first use. You get what you pay for. Probably need to purchase a heavier duty version next year.
1,GrillPro 50057 - Not Recommened,This cover didn't last one season. It has A VERY thin waterproof outer cover our some insulated cotton like material. It easily easily ripped in a moderate wind. I will not purchase this item again.
1,Falls apart in under a year,"I used this grill cover on a stainless grill on my deck in Chicago, IL, in a shady and somewhat sheltered location. It began to crack and fall apart in less than a year, although it wasn't under any stress. I contacted the merchant with the issue through Amazon, and they said it was after their 30 day return period, so tough luck. Don't buy if you need it to last at least a year!"
1,Sizing was wrong! Cheap material rips easy.,"I bought this cover by clicking the Amazon ""buy these together"" button when I also bought a Broil King Signet 90, turns out while the cover looks like its the right size it ripped immediately when put on the grill. It didn't even require force. This is a very poor quality cover AND shouldn't be listed with this particular grill."
2,Not durable,"I've had this grill cover for less than a year. It seems to be made of vinyl, with a fuzzy interior liner. The vinyl is not very thick, and has several holes already. The interior liner is wearing away quickly, so whatever protection it may have afforded is diminishing rapidly. The seams have leaked water from the beginning. It doesn't stay on well in wind. This grill cover didn't cost a fortune, but I expected better quality than this. It lets in enough water that it doesn't completely protect the grill (and that's when it even stays on the grill). I will be looking for something better next time."
2,So-so...if you don't mind rips!,"We had this product maybe a full summer before it started tearing at corners. And, yes, we were careful. You get what you pay for. Spend $20 more and buy a quality cover."
2,Ripping,The cold weather in Minnesota is hard on this cover I think. Mine is ripping after only taking it on and off 4 times.
3,It ripped after only a few months,I mean granted it was sitting outside during Hurricane Sandy. But there is no way around the fact that it did still rip.
2,Cannot stand up to the wind!,"We bought this cover for our newly purchased Broil King Signet 90 gas grill last spring. We were originally impressed with the nice fit, seemingly sturdy build, and as others have mentioned luxurious nappy felt interior. However, it didn't take long for the winds we have to wreak havoc on the cover. We keep our grill outside on our deck, on the leeward (eastern) side of our house, yet this cover simply did not last a year. By the end it was in tatters and torn in many places. We've attached one picture taken today. We've replaced it with the Classic Accessories 73912 Veranda Cart-Style Barbecue Cover, Medium, 58 Inch, which fits quite well and time will tell if it can last longer than one year."
2,Not for the average suburban hobbyist,"Potential purchasers of this booklet should be aware that the author is very serious about his birds. What he considers a ""quite small"" aviary, ""for the aviculturist who has only restricted land area for his hobby"", measures 11 by 16 feet. A ""fairly large"" one is 38 by 24 feet, complete with concrete foundation, plumbing, heating, electric lights, and 12 foot ceilings.If, like me, you are looking for ideas for a small backyard aviary for a few canaries, you should look elsewhere. This publication contains plans for only 6 aviaries. Four are far too large for the average suburban lot, unless you are willing to knock down your house first, and the other two are so rudimentary that plans are hardly necessary."
4,Already Sarted Building,"I found this book to be very helpful as a beginner. It was pretty straight forward with it's directions and yes, there are no big glossy pictures but then you would pay more for this than you need to. The pics are hand drawn and i thought easy to follow. I have already built two aviary's and have had requests from others to build for them too. I recomend this book to anyone just starting out."
1,How to Build Ev erything You Need For Your Birds,"I did not find the book helpful at all. If you want a big aviary it is great, but if you just want to raise a few birds it is not helpful at all. Does not show you how to build small cages for small birds only large outdoor ones, nothing for in the house or to put in a small building. Was very disappointed in the book for the money you are asking for it. Was not really a book in book form. Just a... stack of papers stapled together. Photos of the aviaries are in the back and not with the articles so you have to keep flipping back and forth to see what the writer is talking about. Would not recommend the book at all."
5,Gold Buckle Dreams,"I am not a fan of bull riders in the least. But when given this book, I couldn't put it down! This is a must read for anyone and everyone. Not only is it a great depiction of the life of Chis LeDoux, but shows all readers what a passion for something can help you accomplish. Every moment in this book, made me want to get off my butt and do something with my life too. I credit Chris LeDoux for all his efforts and the author for a wonderful book put into print. There is no way my words can come close to letting you know the emotion and triumph involved in this book. All I can really say is READ IT!"
1,Not the same formula,This is product has a significant difference from previous purchase of Adrien Arpel Foam Cleanser. It is very runny. It appears to either be watered down or it has broken down due to age. I threw it all away since I'm concerned that it is out of date.
1,Product description does not say indoor bulb,The product description does not say that this is an indoor bulb. I bought this for an outdoor fixture and lets see how long it lasts.
1,Not What I Ordered,"I ordered this bulb for a motion sensor light on the front of my house. I was very disappointed when it arrived. Although the order form stated that the item number matched the bulb that I wanted, the number on the bulb that I was sent, was different. The bulb would not work in my light fixture. This was an inexpensive item where the shipping cost was about as much as the bulb itself. I decided not to return it. I do not have faith in the company that shipped the incorrect bulb. I won't order anything from them again.Sylvania 58886 150-Watt 120-Volt Tungsten Halogen Double-Ended Short Lamp with Clear Finish (150T3QSCLRP)"
5,"Brilliant on good, evil and everything in between.","The last reviewer doesn't know what he or she is talking about! This is a rich novel of an American South at once contemporary and timeless, and its many virtues include ear-perfect dialog -- plus a great deal more. What I like best is the character's struggle with the burden of the local morality, a struggle that results in heavy losses, but also a quirky, stirring triumph. Janice Daugharty is Dixie's latest recording angel, a true heir to the legacy of Flannery O'Connor."
2,Only good for solid clogs,"I had a 3.5"" cast iron drain line stopped up under my house. So I bought this figuring it was worth a shot. Crawled under the house, chiseled off the clean out plug and pushed the Drain King down until it met the clog. Pulled back a couple of inches and had someone turn on the water. Waited a minute or so and turned off the water. Pushed the hose back to the clog- no luck. Tried this about 6 times- nothing. Ended up using a heavy duty electric auger. Never found what was clogging the drain, but the auger cleared it just fine. This was over a month ago, still no problems. Don't forsee a use for the Drain King in the future."
5,Fundamental text for music lovers !,"This interesting work contains besides information and valorization of the musical themes in its technical and historical aspects .You will capable to consult any concise definition as legato, etude, glissandi or the scherzo meaningYou will find an invaluable source of works related with wide references , historical age and some other issues of interest.Without any doubt it will be very helpful for history students and music players , for the amateur music a flowing of knowledge and for those who simply listen to , read and enjoy the magic of the audition and the talent of their composers , an inexhaustible scattering work."
2,The Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music and Musicians,"The book that arrived was the correct selection but arrived somewhat damaged with a wrinkled/ folded book cover. If the packing was stronger, then the book would not have been damaged."
2,Not really Fit-All,"Though the rubber on this stopper is fine, it is actually much thinner than the picture shows and is definitely not ""fit-all"" in the sense of keeping the water contained. It fits over my drain, yes, but it does not hold securely at all if the water even moves in my tub."
1,"Nope, not a Fit-All stopper.","I bought this stopper, believing that it, as it says, is a ""Fit-All"" stopper. It does not fit. Save your money."
3,It will do maybe for more modern tubs,"This plug is heavier and thicker than depicted. It is a little too large in diameter around the top lip and thus does not sit well in the drain. In fact, it leaks. It's just so hard to find a plug for a bath tub these days, if your tub is an old one... like mine. This one will be replaced too as soon as I can find a better one in person. I would not recommend buying this due to it's odd size."
4,Realistic and Scary,"The story takes place in Pakistan and Afghanistan not long after 9/11. Stan Kelly, Skelly, is a ex-war correspondent has taken on an assignment to cover Pakistan's border region, and is determined to enter Afghanistan. Yet he can travel there alone so he needs a translator of sorts thus enters Najeeb. This novel is full of conflict, love, betrayal, war, danger etc. very exciting realistic scary it was pretty good. sometimes it gets bogged down in detail and too much organization and that can drag but it was pretty good."
2,"A thriller, but disappointing","This is the story of a young man from the border Afghanistan intertwined with that of an American journalist. It truly was a thriller, as I felt I couldn't put it down until I'd finished it, but when I did finish it, I wasn't satisfied. Many of the issues in the young man's life weren't resolved, or resolved with only more anger, bitterness and malice, and the journalist's story is tragic. I enjoyed the story for not being predictable. If all you're interested in is a modern thrilling adventure, you may enjoy the book, but I guess I expect a little more from what I call a good book. An underlying message of hope and forgiveness, perhaps?"
3,A good enough thriller but nothing spectacular,The problem with this book is one of timing since 9/11 every thriller you read involves terrorists or terrorism as some kind of plot or subplot. For what it is the characters in this book are fairly clever and well drawn but since I don't live in the Middle East or Afghanistan at no time could I connect with the characters. Its fine as a thriller (easily beats anything I ever read by Robert Ludlum) and it does make me want to check out other books by Dan Fesperman but I feel that setting your books in a current hot spot cheapens the actual human misery that is happening in these places every single day.
2,"Slow pace, flat writing","Considering the promising subject matter of this book, who'd have thought it would turn out to be such a bore. The writing--both description and dialog--is laced with the lamest of cliches. The characters are flat and the situations, unconvincing. Did this book have an editor?"
4,A realistic political thriller,"In a newsman's journey through Afghanistan and Pakistan, The Warlord's Son reveals in gritty detail just how confusing and irresolvable the political situation is in this part of the world. There is no right and wrong here, just tribal and ethnic conflicts which take on a higher-level label (""freedom fighter,"" ""ally"", ""enemy"") depending on convenience at a given time. The characters of the translator Najeeb (the warlord's son of the title), his girlfriend, and a woman professor who supports her, are all well-done and convincing. Curiously, the newsman Skelly is a rather shadowy figure who doesn't come across as fully real. Still, this is a good read, and one that gives much insight into this conflicted region of the world."
4,The Warlord's Son could be a Traitor-ous motion picture,"With films like Traitor (with Don Cheadle), along with The Kingdom, Lions for Lambs and other films that have offered looks into the war on terror and our post-9/11 environment, The Warlord's Son reads like a novel that is ready to make a quick leap from written word to the big screen.Others, including the editorial reviews featured on the product page, note how skillfully Dan Fesperman paints the environment with his writing. Sadly that seems to be a lost art for many, or at least is an art that is hard to master (some try, but seem to go so far overboard in describing things that they lose most readers who quickly bore with the verbiage, see for example Tom Clancy).The Warlord's Son is a good read, in a package that somewhat fools the buyer. In just over 300 pages, readers get a lot of grit and substance that flows quickly. Immerse yourself into this one!"
2,Quality could be better,"I got these for my 7-year-old daughter who loves to draw. The box is adorable, the color selection is excellent, but the pencil leads constantly break while drawing, even with a normal amount of pressure. I tried them myself to confirm that. So, it's a lot of extra pencil sharpening and smudged artwork. Very frustrating for a kid. I'm sorry to say that I wouldn't recommend these."
2,"Too basic, not too useful, instead I would recommend Tim Hil","Too basic, not too useful, instead I would recommend Tim Hill's books"
3,Packaging causes problems,"I have ordered these almonds on five occasions but now am going to order a different brand. The problem with Klein's almonds is the packaging. With each delivery the tops of one or two of the containers arrived open, with some of the almonds spilled into the inner box. With the last delivery three of the containers had spilled, many almonds were in the inner box, and they were stale. A fine product compromised by inadequate packaging."
5,crunchy and nutritious,"These almonds are unsalted and delicious, nutritious and great for snacking. The resealable container is convenient and reusable when empty. The only problem - when they arrived, 2 of the containers had come open and some of the almonds were in the bottom of the box."
3,Buy an Estwing,Functional but not great. The head is a little too light. The handle is too smooth. When its wet it gets a little slippery. The handle is not as comfortable as Estwing. It is too narrow.I wish I purchased an Estwing instead.
4,Great for parties,"My daughter recently celebrated her 3rd birthday and she's really into Disney Princesses. I ordered 6 Disney Princess Scene Setters for the party and they were a hit with the other little guests as well. Now that the party's over, I'm planning to stick them around her bedroom wall as part of the Princess theme decor. It's a thin plastic sheet and easy to stick onto glass surfaces though I haven't yet figured out how to stick them onto wallpaper without using permanent glue..."
2,A poor recording of a great rock group,"I bought this CD on the basis of the other reviews here and was expecting to be awed by the recording. Having been a Queen fan for many years, I was expecting to hear a great live concert. The problem is that the recording is of poor quality. It sounds like it was recorded by a bootlegger sitting at the back of the stadium. The music is great, but it feels like you're listening to someone's tape recorder. This CD was a waste of money."
4,Beautiful...,"This one is the first one I bought when I started my collection and let me tell you...It's a blast! Such a treat when you are singing along to their infamous Live at '86 whilst you are taking a bubble bath, pelting out the notes and words and not caring when your sister yells at you to shut up. A great sing-a-long and Freddie has got a personality on him! WOW! What more can I say. Brian and his unforgettable Brighton Rock solo, Freddie with his vibrance and his vigor, and the crowd's overzealous cries! I have some of their yells memorized when I sing to it. Two CD's, so worth your money and your time, and it will guarantee you a TRUE Queen fan. Rock on brothers..."
5,Best Live CD by QUEEN!,"This is definately one of the best if not THE best live performance, although the quality of the CD isn't so good, the show is amazing, in the first CD you'll hear all the Queen classics, such as Tie your Mother Down, One Vision, etc. and on the second CD they are moving to something that sounds a bit like the 50s-60s Rock N' Roll with songs like: Hello Mary Lou, Tutti Frutti and more. If you are a Queen fan don't even think twice just click on Buy Now and that's all, if you're just starting with Queen and Freddy, you should buy this CD but I would also recommend some of their oldies, because live performance is great, no doubt about it, but the original is always better. Anyways, this is Freddy Mercury and Queen giving the Show of a life time in at Wembley Stadium."
5,AMAZING CONCERT BY A FANTASTIC BAND.,"The 1986 Wembley concert was fantastic,a great show by a master showman and his band.There was alot that was lost in the c.tape as well as the video,but this LP/CD recording has the whole thing.A wonderful concert to remember Freddie by."
3,"Hello again, my beauties!","This double CD set features a Queen concert recorded in July, 1986 in England. Queen was not popular in the US anymore by this point, but they were still enormously popular in most of the rest of the world, so much so that they were able to fill a football(soccer) stadium. The concert lasts one hour and 50 minutes. It is a good concert, but not Queen at their best. Freddie Mercury's voice was not what it used to be, due to years of smoking. Sometimes he doesn't bother to sing at all, and lets the audience sing the lyrics, which must have been fun for the people in the audience, but isn't much fun for us. But it's still a pretty good concert, and Queen fans should enjoy it."
3,The worst period,"While not Live Killers (Queens best live album) this album is not Queens worst live album, that honor falls to Live Magic but this is no Live At The Bowl certainly. The mid 80s Queens final period Live was their worst. Smoking had destroyed Freddies vocals and the band were playing simpler and with more of an offstge/onstage musician and less energy. Their talents were therefore undermined unlike the 70s and even early 80s. Small wonder they stopped touring."
3,BUY LIVE KILLERS INSTEAD,"THIS ALBUM IS O.K. BUT THIS IS QUEEN WHEN THEY WERE ON THE DECLINE, THEIR HEARTS AREN'T IN IT AND FREDDIE'S VOICE SOUNDS HORRIBLE.BUY LIVE KILLERS, THAT WAS RECORDED IN '79 WHEN QUEEN WERE AT THE HEIGHT OF THEIR POWERS AND FREDDIE SOUNDED SO MUCH BETTER!"
4,Pure Queen,"I was very honored and fortunate to be at these concerts in 1986 at Wembley. The album sort of captures what it was like to be there and listening to it always sends little goosebumps up my arms. Without a doubt, Queen were and always will be the best live performance group in the World but you can't catch and bottle it without losing something. Still, if you're a fan, it's worth having the album.Miss ya, Freddy!"
4,A Gift to Myself,This book is extremely helpful in the self improvement arena. I am very pleased with the ease of reading and directness of content.
5,Knowledge Sets You Free,"This book should be basic reading for every Christian who has received Jesus (Jeshua) as their Saviour. The Lord (Adonai) says, ""My people are dying for lack of knowledge"" and this will help cure that problem. Just read and receive your freedom from the Lord!"
4,Family Secrets,I got this book after talking to one of my sibling who has been distant from the family for the past 27 years. Every family has dark secrets and this book enlightened my understanding to some of the family secrets that are really family curses passed on from generation to generation. If you have an understanding of the bible it will all make more sense to you and if you don't then it woud be a great time to draw close to a church that teaches salvation and the basic biblical concepts.
4,purchasing second hand books,There were a few markings on the book but on the whole the product was in excellent condition. I am enjoying the contents of the books
1,"Generational influence- of course. Generational curses- no way!,","The fact is that ""Generational Curses"" is a primitive superstition first taught as Christian doctrine around the 1980s. It is not Christianity. It is a disgusting teaching designed to weigh people down with guilt, fear and paranoia, thus increasing their reliance on (and contributions to) the minister/shaman who alone can recite the magic spells that will break the ""curse"". Oh, what valuable contributions America has made to the Faith! This horrible teaching would seem more appropriate coming from a skull-bedecked witch doctor on the banks of the Zambezi than from any true servant of Christ. I would suggest to all who are suffering under this ridiculous delusion to read the 18th chapter of Ezekiel, Jeremiah 31:29-30, and perhaps the entire New Testament. (Ever hear of Jesus Christ?)"
5,Outstanding,To those who only know Shirley Booth by Hazel this is a must see. Her other classic movie Hot Spell shows a similar dramatic flair. Booth shines as a a woman who is caught in circumstances and is forced to live with them. The funny thing is the circumstances didn't and shouldn't have been.We see Lola coping by trying to relive her youth through her border while her husband copes by simply ignoring or forgetting the past (through his drinking).Shirley Booth only made four movies and this is a must see.
3,An ambitious attemp but not very insightful,"I give the movie credit for tackling complex and difficult phases of life that lead a middle-aged couple to loneliness, anxiety, and (the husband) to drink. There is a lot of pathos and probing but I am not sure of the insight and resolution (is the solution for the wife to take better care of herself and the house, and the pretty tenant to move out?) So i don't see a lot of payoff for sitting through the sadness and wife's nagging, though i was pleased to see the husband, after his latest (and last?) bout with drinking look at this wife and smile."
3,"rather boring, actually","I realize why so many others gave this the highest rating. However, Ijust could not help thinking - this woman needs to get a life. She is soneedy. Every time she called her husband ""daddy"" I wanted to scream.She spends the vast majority of her time trying to get the dullard'sattention and approval.The outcome is so predictable. The wife welcomes a sexy little collegestudent into their home as a symbolic replacement for the baby she lostmany years before. And the husband's interest is at first non-existentand then becomes more than fatherly.Maybe I have heard this story too many times. I don't know, but I hadhoped for something at least a little more subtle."
4,Good variety compilation of Muggeridge,"I learned of Muggeridge via Buckley's Firing Line program. This book contains the transcripts of those programs. I bought the book because it had a foreword by Buckley, so I figured it would represent Muggeridge's works fairly interestingly and might contain the transcripts of Buckley and Muggeridge interacting, which was definitely intriguing. And the book does a good survey. I have not completed reading the book, but what I've read is valuable for one interested in Muggeridge's religious journey and reflections, including the transcripts on Firing Line."
3,makes your collection complete,"lot has been said about this film, after the success of the blockbuster Titanic. It's thrilling to see Leonardo di Caprio acting in a down to earth feature."
4,Youngsters' sexism,"Fuelled with awaken sexual urges, youngsters spent night out at Don's Plum restaurant, deliberating approaches to trance-gender relations and exercising personal dreams.Natural performing by then young recent stars makes this clear-student-project film nice to watch on any viewer's personal merits."
3,"Good features, so-so ergonomics","I was looking for a USB keyboard with an in-built USB hub, which the KU709 does quite well while managing to look quite stylish.Keys are however like laptop keys, not much travel. Also, strangely enough, this keyboard doesn't come with feet so you can't adjust height from the back; it lays flat just like a laptop keyboard, which not everyone likes."
5,super cute,"My daughter got this for Christmas yesterday, she loves this dog. Shes 2 1/2 and has made it sneeze, loves the barking. She doesnt get the petting of it to get it excited and really barking and wagging his tail but eventually she will. I help her get it going and she thinks its funny. Ive just sat there and rubbed the puppy and had it give me kisses and then realized the kids have left the room. Its a great toy, I would suggest it for anyones little one."
5,my daughter won't put this down,"We bought this for our 8 year old daughter for Christmas. She plays with it all the time. She wont put it down. I don't know why she wanted it at first, because we more dog at home than anyone would ever want, but she loves it. The nose really gets cold, I was thinking of buying her two of these, but am glad that I only bought one. It does make noise and wag its tail, and if it were anymore it would have gotten on my nerves. So if you are thinking about buying this for a child that loves animals, go for it. I think that you will be happy with the purchase, and I know that your child will!"
2,Disappointing,"I bought the Cold Nose Puppy Cocker Spaniel for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. It is impossible for her to get the toy to do anything. We have to do it for her and half the time, I can't get the puppy to do what it does. Also, please be aware that the puppy doesn't move. It makes noises and wags it's tail. The battery pack is in the stomach and the velcrow doesn't stay closed. Not at all happy with this toy."
5,Helps warn the deaf and blind!,"Required by law for Hotels. The thing is loud so if you are not deaf, never be in its presence or you'll end up deaf."
1,Warning!,"I have orderd this product twice, and both times it was shipped to me without the Progrm CD, and a data CD, which the manual states is included. VERY poor quality control on the part of Window's on Wall Street. BEWARE."
4,Size Chart?,"Hi there,These boots arrived on time and are very good quality and in good condition.Only complaints are about the size chart on the website. I realise it's difficult to get exact conversions but other than that, very happy with product and seller."
2,Untruth in Advertising,"The subtitle of this book is ""Stories of Special Forces from Iraq to Afghanistan."" Why then, is over half the book taken from the Vietnam conflict? And one of the stories is by that foul-mouthed self-promoting braggart, Richard Marcenko, a name that makes real navy seals wince in embarassment.There is not one original story in the entire book, and it's the only book I've ever purchased only to realize that I'd read it already. Each article is some re-hashed part of another book that most SF fans will have already read.Very disappointing."
2,Disappointing,"This book had some good stories, but lacked the stories advertised by the title, hense the warning, don't judge a book by it's cover! I first thought that a new title would be appropriate, but the stories themselves do not belong in the same book. I've read some of the stories in other books."
4,A complex book,In the books I read there is not a single more cited author then Noam Chomsky. Curious about this man and knowing that his major contributions have been in the realm of language I decided the pick up the book. While I found what he has to say very thought provoking and intellectually stimulating it is not straight forward. If you have no background to language at all it takes some serious effort and slow reading to read this book. It's pretty short and some parts are pretty dry but I cannot deny that the conclusions and topics discussed are both intellectually stimulating and provocative in nature.If you are just looking for books that stretch your mind there are other books out there that may resonate more strongly with your interests but this is as good as any.
1,Big Jimmy Fan,"I was really disapointed with this DVD. The episodes are just horrible! The only good episode is-Granny Baby-Please, wat ever you do, DON'T buy this. The following Jimmy Neutron DVDS are 85% better. If you are a big Jimmy fan, and were dissapointed in this DVD, write a review mentioning my name,-Anti-B-. Thanks."
5,Jimmy Scores Again,"Great Jimmy Neutron DVD. I bought this for my kids. Needless to say, I watch it with them!"
3,From Chris Flynn,Anyone wishing to contact the band can do so @CROOTNIK@aol.com And no I'm not trying to sell you anything !
5,AIA Where are you now?,"If you like the days when you could understand what the artist sang, the lyrics actually had a meaning, the songs had great melodies, the voices and instrumentation were incredible..... combine all that with alternating ballads and rockers... and you have AIA. The only review here so far not 5 stars was the comment by Chris Flynn, one of the band members. Well, Chris, if you happen to read this.... please give us your new email so we can pester you about trying to release some more music. Or at least tell us where we can get a copy of ""From the vaults"", a cd containing previously unreleased material, which seems to be in very short supply....And this time give yourself a well-deserved 5 stars."
2,Mediocre,"Despite having been backed enough to hire a great producer/engineer and two top session players to cover up the group's poor musicianship and give them a sound they would not otherwise be able to create on their own, this very 80's wannabee prog/rock record still falls flat. The lyrics are horrendous at best....though there are some hooky melodies at times. Overall it presents as a self absorbed attempt at Xeroxing truly talented bands of the era but ends up being trite and disingenuous."
3,For it's time....it's OK,"I bought this simply for the fun of it. I recall the tile cut getting some airplay however couldn't justify the price of vinyl at that time. This one came up ""cheap"" during a search so I bought it. Doubt it will get a lot of play from me."
3,Another early-80s song that instantly caught my ear,"""Art in America"" is yet another early-80s song that caught my ear after hearing it only once or twice. I found the LP in 1989 and have enjoyed the song for years knowing only that the band is the three Flynn siblings--Chris, Shishonee, and Dan. Notable names among the album's contributors are Dixie Dregs T. Lavitz (keyboards) and Steve Morse (arrangements)."
3,Be sure off your size,"The pants themselves are great, but be sure what size you're having.I'm always ordering jeans in 30x30 but obviously, these were to small for me...So I would say, buy a bigger size, I didn't.Good Luck"
3,Not Stone Washed,"These fit fine, but I am not sure why the product description says they are stone washed. The are normal denim overalls."
2,Pockets not properly stitched,The pockets are not properly stitched and therefore stick outside of the overalls. I am in the process of returning them. Imdo not think I will risk exchange as I do not want to receive another imporperly stitched pair.
5,be like Ernest :),"Wow, this product is so comfortable as i was thinking to buy a dozn not to wear something else in my life except them just like Ernest :)I advice to be bought, but note that u dont need to buy them by your exact waist size as they will be held by sholders, so just go for 1 more bigger size to be more comfortable."
2,bib overalls,"top left pocket snap failed after one wearing, I did order another pair out of wanting to give this product a fair shot."
2,"Should be listed as ""short"" torso","The length of the legs was fine, as was the waist but the shoulder straps barely reached to connect. Im only 5'11 so Im a regular. They should tell customers these are ""short"" torso and not regular or long. You buy things like this for comfort and ease of movement. Walking bent over or struggling to get them fastened isnt my idea of comfort. If I was shorter they would be a good buy."
5,Great results on this shopping experience,"Great product, Great price Fast shipping.........would highly recommend this purchase to anyone. Am going to make another order very soon"
