5,"accurate description, fast shipping",exactly what I expected! Batteries have held up well and no issues to speak of... good item at a great price!
5,Good Batteries at a Good Price,Having small children I go through batteries like crazy. Amazon has a better price then the box stores so getting them through them is a no-brainer. Duracell has always been my choice of batteries since I've never had one blow or leak. These AA's come in a box and inside there are individual boxes that hold four batteries each. I like that. Not crazy about those plastic packages.
4,Go for it,Good reliable batteries for a good price. Can't find them any cheaper at your local stores. Would recommend this product.
2,Missing a Track,"The MP3 version of this album is missing the last track Idea and Deed. The tracks are mislabeled, so the track title New Gypsy is left out, but the actual missing song is the last one (Idea and Deed). In all, there should be 12 tracks on this album. BEWARE!The two stars is for the missing song. The album, itself, is fantastic. If Amazon fixes this problem, definitely pick it up."
4,Good train whistle,"I bought this train whistle for my 3 year old son and he loves it. It makes a great, realistic train sound- and it's not too loud."
5,Train Whistle,"It was what I orderd, and in good (new) condition. It came when they said it would, I would do business with them again."
3,"great sound, but too big to blow into","I love the sound of this, but the fact that my 2,5 year son can't put his whole mouth around it, and that you need to blow quite heavy in it, makes it more fun for the parent than for him. He prefers the Kazoo instead"
5,Great Whistle for our school band,"Purchased these whistles for our school band and they are working great. Well made. The price was right too. We have no budget for our music program so the parents have to chip in. These were so affordable, we were able to get all we needed."
3,Pretty good,"I read a lot of biography and historical fiction and I was intrigued by the reviews of this book so I bought it. The print is large, there are many reproductions of paintings, and it's a rather quick read, but it's ""pretty good"" as far as historical biography goes. It was interesting to read a thumbnail sketch of the rise and fall of the Virginia tobacco farmers, and it was also a fun task to try and keep track of all of the Randalph's as they inter-married! The main problem that keeps the book from being truly wonderful is that the scandal and the main characters aren't very compelling to begin with and the author doesn't do much to infuse the story with any urgency. There a few points where I found myself wondering what would happen next, but for the most part I was simply mildly entertained and when I was finished I felt I'd read a decent book that further illuminated a period in American history for a me and also educated me about Nancy Randolph and her kinsmen."
4,nothing new under the sun,"I really enjoyed this book. The scandal and trial of Nancy and Richard Randolph is just part of the story. The rest of the book deals with Nancy's life after the trial, and the effect it had on her family, including her in-laws. There were many difficulties and bad behavior that continued to plague the Randolph family years afterward. Lots of historical facts and people are part of this true drama that played out in the early years of our country. Not exactly a light read, but not too difficult."
4,Helpful architect's reference,"This book gives simple guides to design work. Like a simplified ""Graphic Standards"". Ching offers super illustrations, lots of details and answers a lot of questions for me as an architecture student. I recommend to all designers."
1,empty and unfufilling,"I'm still not quite sure what to make of this CD. Several friends reccomended it to me siting my interest w/ aphex twins, u-ziq and other IDM groups as a reason for trying out pan sonic.I liked the cover art and the nearly unpronouncable song titles and I can see how this could be great chillout background music but I was greatly disappointed. Each track shimmers with washes of electronic bleeps and feedback and distortion but they all sound like blueprints to a better song, they all come across incomplete. After each track I listened to I was left disappointed, anticipating something more. A deeper level of sound or texture or even, dare I say it, soul.Not to say that this isn't a good disc, I'm sure fans of pan sonic are thrilled with this release. I love minimalistic electronic music,however for me, I was left empty and unfufilled and after two listens of this disc I returned it for the new Orb instead."
2,Again and again and...,Being a big fan of Autechre and Biosphere and the like I tried this cd out.Some of the tracks start out promising and made me listen closer. But then it turns out they stay that way. If there is any feeling in these tracks (as is the case with Autechre) I have been unable to locate it.Little pieces of music not related (as far as I can tell) in any way.
1,Jarringly unbalanced and negative,"This incredibly biased account of the life of a true patriot is not worth the trouble of reading. The author has systematically tried to discredit Collins, acheivement by acheivement. As this is the third version of Collins biography I've read, (I consider Coogan's the fairest). I began to see very quickly that each chapter would be a demolition of whatever had been considered admirable portions of his short life. Once more Collins has been assassinated, this time there is no mystery in the identity of the perpetrator."
2,"poison coated facts, too much subjectiveness","At first, gaining facts presented by 'demystifying the legend' seemed a fair un-sugar-coated way of adding to the collective knowledge base of the subject. (or any subject for that matter). That's why I bought the book. The gain of the book is some of the early career and life facts of the subject.Unfortunately, the author's glue by which he holds his facts together becomes venomous, revealing his bias. This subjective tone progresses throughout the publication and by the last chapter of the book, the author has dropped all pretense of fact reporting and reveals his uncontrollable inner hatred of the subject matter.An analogous book could be titled, 'Demystifying Honest Abe Lincoln', by John Wilkes Booth"
1,Utter Tripe,"Hart,we get it - you've an opinion that is contrary to history. Yet you do not put forth any evidence in support of your contrarian views."
1,Disappointed,"Having studied this period of Irish History intensely I looked forward to this new contribution to the War of Independence/Civil War history. Within a few pages I discovered that I had purchased a book whose author seemed bent on destroying the reputation of a man who nearly singlehandedly turned the course of Irish history (and indeed world history). No dig is left undug and no innuendo is too low in this corrupted work. Although there are factual tidbits thrown in, they are not consequential. If you have an interest in this book borrow it. Do not pay good money to an author who would desecrate the memory of a great leader. By all means read it if you must, but read other works by Coogan, Forester, O'Connor, MacKay, Nelson and even Beaslai to inform yourself lest you be taken in by this unbalanced author. This book will soon relegated to the trash bin where it belongs."
1,Very disappointing.,"I took this book to Ireland with me to read during a recent vacation. For my education, I asked people everywhere I ventured, from museum officials to local people in pubs and on golf courses, about Michael Collins. Mr. Hart, Michael Collins batted 1.000 and he is remembered as Ireland's greatest modern era hero. Collins brilliantly ran the whole operation compelling Great Britain to hand over the keys to Dublin Castle. When he signed the treaty with Britain, he acknowledged he had signed his own death warrant. What his brave man accomplished before his death at 31 is more than remarkable. In Ireland, he is a man for the ages. The writer has done better with other subjects and should have left this one alone."
2,A Revistionist Historian Trying to Turn Hearts,"I will keep this review rather short and to the point. As a former professor at Queens College in Belfast, one would not expect a a fair or unbiased book from Peter Hart. It should be no suprise then that Hart has attempted to take one of the great figures in 20th Century Irish history and paint him in a less than savory light. The sad fact is that this book is trite Unionist propaganda and should be regulated to a musty basement somewhere where it will never be read by anyone who is just begining to learn about Collins"
1,Revisonist rubbish.......,"This account portrays Collins as cold, calculating, incompetent and a sly opportunist...without any real skills or leadership. Every aspect of his life is presented as a lie, this is revisionist histroy on the level of David Irving..."
5,World History Teacher,This is a great visual depiction of World History if your looking for a timeline that can be used to decorate the classroom or be seen from across the room. If your looking for detail this timeline is not for you.
4,"Historic or not, a swinging, well-played, thoughtful set.","Not exactly the historic encounter one might hope for with the legendary Art Pepper on the date, but nonetheless a well-excuted yet relaxed (maybe a bit ""too"" relaxed to bring out Pepper's passionate intensity), ceaselessly swinging and satisfying session(how can it not be with Billy Higgins on drums?), recorded just months before Pepper's passing. There's very little if any ""showboating"" on the date, and Cole is a revelation on baritone sax. This is a Cole recording that's not merely impressive but eminently replayable."
3,could not get into it,"I do not know if I did not like this book because of the slow pace or because of the view point all being from a small boy. I bought it after being told it was urban fantasy, with similar style to the Borderland short story series and Charles de Lint. Utterly wrong. Go read a Charles de Lint book or Tanya Huff instead."
2,I choose not to read books with swearing in them.,Simple as that. I stopped reading at page 24 with the second swear word. Next time I will stop at the first. The reading and story line seemed well done and interesting but I do not need the swearing.
4,Interesting,"An interesting and very readable view on the late '50s - early '60s in the South. Told from a child's point of view, it was often unrealistic that the child would remember or comprehend most of the conversations and the author has very small children doing things that kids that age are just not capable of, but if you can put that aside, it is insightful."
5,tv towns,"I thought TV Towns was just fabulous! It's fun, informative, and full of interesting facts about a variety of television shows. I couldn't stop reading about all the programs I watched as a child-from 'Dark Shadows' to 'Petticoat Junction'. It really brought back fond memories of my favorite shows growing-up along with some more recent addictions like 'The Simpsons' and 'Dawsons Creek'. If you want to know where to dine in Cicely, Alaska or how high the murder rate is in Cabot Cove this is where to look. I especially enjoyed the ""Did You Know"" sections for each chapter. Mr. Tropiano is an informed, witty writer. This book will make a great gift for anyone, including yourself!"
5,Great Book by a Forgotten Author,"Stanley Loomis is one of those cases that inspire a feeling of sadness because of an early death and and even earlier oblivion of the deceased. Loomis had the time to write only 4 books and all of them were prodigiously well written and deep in perception of persons and places, environments and feelings. Not very respected, though, by the scholars, who never quote him, it has and always will have a committed following of what most matter, readers."
3,Great purchase but mixed feelings,"I am not an executive chef by a long shot so take my comments with a ""grain of salt."" I am a very passionate weekend pizza connoisseur. I study and practice the art and science of cooking incredible pizza very seriously. In any event this book provides some great insight, stories and recipes...and for that reason I would definitely buy it. It just surprises me that Tony gives some advice that seems outdated or novice....such as rolling out the dough to avoid getting air pockets....and not even talking about the concept of a two-three day cold rise proofing technique. Perhaps he is simply trying to appease the masses and not get overly complicated. Anyway Tony is obviously brilliant and it is otherwise a great book. Enjoy."
4,pizza,"Very nice simple pizza cookbook. Nice photos, although there could of been more of them, and recipes are written in good detail. Good cookbook for the novice."
3,Good pizza book,"I was a little disappointed after browsing through this book. I have no doubt Diane and Tony and excellent at what they do but I would not count this book as a crowning achievement and I'm certainly NOT throwing away all my other pizza books. The explanation on throwing pizza is vague and the photography not of a technical nature. I noted at least one picture that did not match the ingredient list for that pizza. Almost any pizza professional can tell you that you absolutely never add oil to the water or to the flour before the water but that's exactly what one recipe tells you to do. On the plus side, the photograpy is excellent, inspiration abounds, and the source section is excellent. I'm glad I added this fine book to my collection."
3,Print too light,"The recipes are alright, somthing for everybody. The pictures looked delishous, but the print was too light.It was just too much trouble trying see the recipe print so I gave up. It got on my nerves straining too see. I donated it to a yard sale. Oh and by the way, my vision is good!"
2,Pizza Book,This Book was not what I expected. I have other Pizza making books and this one is by far the worst. You can get most all the dough recipes right off the internet for free. Absolutely nothing new and no real value. Also no real tricks of the trade like advertized. I expected Toni's input to have some great ideas/secrets on developing great dough and what a disapointment. I think his only value was his name in the book. Great Disapointment and would not recommend this book for anyone looking to make serious pie!!
3,Probably fine - haven't used it,"Writing reviews that have backlogged on Amazon has helped me to realize how rarely I end up using the stuff I impulsively buy on Amazon. I bought the pizza stone and the recipe book, have yet to make my first homemade pizza"
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"LOUSY PHOTOS, LOUSY RECIPES, TINY TYPE THAT'S HARD TO READ, POOR INK COLOR. DON'T WASTE A DIME ON THIS BOOK."
1,Bad Pizza,"The Pizza is a dish that has evolved in Europe for over 2000 years. Examples of which can be found in , Turkey, Greece, Macedonia, and of course Italy. So Why, oh why ... do people have to make this uninformed cultural imperialistic book. I mean ...one chapter on Italian pizza and four on American.. Has the world gone mad?Thai Pizza ??? Some research needed outside the USA I would say. A waste of money!"
4,beautiful sacrelige,"The Savior comes to post WWI industrial America to weigh in on a labor relations and post war reactionary politics. A brilliant set-up for a satire, executed sharply and funnily. I love it, but I have a high tolerance for Socialist thinking and sacrelige."
5,a modern day jesus,"Upton Sinclair aims to stir a religous America to act out against the injustices of big businesses by asking and showing what Jesus would do if he would have been there during the Great Depression and the continual striking by certain groups. By bringing in an idealist in a land of pessism and distraction, Sinclair shows the readers how they should act toward one another through the sayings and action of this modern day prophet."
3,Be careful - not all CDs have the 4 bonus tracks at the end,Not really a review - just that I bought a copy for the 4 bonus tracks at the end (Tracks 33 - 36) - and to my surprise my copy only had 32 tracks! So their may be two versions out there?
1,Junk,"The trip lite is junk.You can buy better quality for less money if you shop around.I've been a licensed ham for 23 years and have used many different power supplies,this one lasted almost 5 months before burning out.Pure junk!!"
2,Tripp Lite's quality is not what it once was...,"When I powered the PR20 for the first time, sparks flew from the vents. A wire carrying the 120VAC input to the transformer was shorting to the case. I repaired the uninsulated wire with some heat-shrinkable tubing and the PR20 worked.When on, the PR20 continuously produces an audible 60Hz hum that can be heard from at least 10 feet away.The PR20's output terminals are uninsulated threaded rods that extend approximately three centimeters beyond the rear of the case. An insulated binding post would be a safer alternative.On a positive note, the PR20 continues to work after six months of continuous use. However, in light of the design and manufacturing defects mentioned above, I would only purchase another PR20 if there were no other alternatives.I give the PR20 two stars, in part because there are lower-quality power supplies available on the market."
5,Procell all the way,"LOVE the procell version of Duracells. It really feels like I get more juice out of them. I put two of these in my 2 cell maglite, and have the rest stored next to my 6 cell mag. The two cell is still going strong with no signs of fading. These are good to have/use for emergency situations when you really can't compromise quality to save a few bucks."
5,I ordered two and the boxes were sealed,"I don't care if the boxes were opened or sealed, these are professional use batteries, the shelf life is for like mar 2016 on the two boxes I purchased, If you went out and bought these at a store they would be very expensive, as normal, amazon does a better than average job shipping. a box in a box."
1,Box came opened and some batteries didn't have power in them,Title says it all. The box was opened and taped shut and some of the batteries didn't work.Though they were good about getting me refunded.
2,"Oops, 11 is the new 12","This clearly was not a ""new"" item. It arrived and the package for the batteries had a piece of broken scotch tape over the opening flap. I opened it and there were only 11 batteries in the box of ""12"". It's not worth it to me to return it, but what a disappointment. I'm just hoping the batteries are actually new and not used."
2,Did Not Perform Well,"I was so excited to find such a great deal on D batteries, especially on the Duracell brand, but they have not performed well. I bought them solely to use in my baby swing, but they only last 2 weeks in there. Compared to Rayovac and Duracell Coppertop that's half as long, as these other two will last me a month. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Open box not acceptable,"When I received my box of 12 D batteries the box had already been opened - the seal was open on the box. So are the batteries used? I don't know. I do know I did not get what I paid for, a new sealed product, and that is never acceptable, especially for something like batteries. The company is wesellbatteries.com - I will avoid them when buying more."
5,Exactly the same as Coppertops on the inside,"These procell batteries are exactly the same technical specs as the regular coppertops. The only difference is packaging and price. I, for one, am more than happy to forego the plastic packaging that requires a knife and band-aids to open. The only downside is that the box contains all 12 batteries in one box, without any sub-boxes. The box itself is poorly made and falls apart once opened, so plan on storing the loose batteries somewhere if you are not using all 12 at once."
2,AA batteries in a D shell,"Batteries didn't even last a week in my newborn's swing. Plus I have two trail cameras that take 6 D batteries each and it's lucky if I i got 200 pictures off them before I had to change the batteries out. The batteries before these I could get over 2000 pitures. I'm not going to buy cheap batteries anymore. If you use D batteries often, you should spend the money on a good rechargeable battery."
5,Works great.,"Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.For video reviewsMake it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining?How about a little action? If it makes sense, cut to the product in use as you describe your experiences with it."
1,Not What I Expected,"So here come these batteries that look like they were made in a basement somewhere. Probably Estonia or Mexico. I haven't as yet used them, so they might be OK. I am a Battery fool who thinks someday that when the electricity finally goes out for a very long time, I am prepared. Where were these batteries made? I couldn't find a source..."
5,Last as long as store bought batteries.,These batteries work good for me. Last as long or longer as any other batteries I used in the past. 5 Stars!!!
3,ok,"the product works, but was poorly packed and the box broke and the batteries were all over the carton. they work though."
3,Yet another opened box...,"Batteries about 7 months old, not exactly fresh for pro batteries. Box looks old and beatup. Seal on box was broken as well. I expect better from Amazon. Good price but dissappointed by what I received. Batteries seem to work ok."
2,Open Box and scuffed batteries . . .,The box was ripped open and the batteries were old looking and scuffed. I will let you know how they worked
1,Batteries Leak,I used these batteries in a beatbox portable and they started leaking after 3 days! Good thing I noticed the leak before it ruined my $400 boombox.
1,They don't come any WORSE OR WEAKER than these,"Zero stars would be appropriate. I have an automatic waste can that uses ""D"" batteries. I bought these because they were out of Rayovac's.The ""DEAD"" batteries I was sent were in my waste can about 2 friging hours (1/12 of a day) and they wouldn't even open the lid anymore.I sent these crappy batteries back and luckily they had more Rayovacs in stock. The first four Rayovac have been opening the lid for FOUR months now compared to the TWO HOURS for the Duracell.By the Rayovacs, they work and have power. They last for months compared to 1 Day for this crap. I have 40-50 Rayovac AA and AAA rechargeable batteries for many uses and they last for many years and cost about 1/2 the price of Bunny and Copper crap batteries."
2,Are they really new???,"The batteries I received do not look new and the seal on the box is broken too. I am disappointed by what I received. They look old. I am yet to test if they work fine. They arrived in no time, that's the only other good thing apart from it's price!!"
2,4 y/o batteries buyer beware,2009 batteries -4 years oldten year lifeeleven more words needed for review =the date of manufacture and expiration shouldalways be offered at time of purchasetoo good to be true (price) pans out
1,Didn't work,These batteries came in a worn out looking box and the batteries barely worked in anything I put them in. When I actually got some of them to work they device stayed on for an hour at the most. I requested a return but the company said I could if I paid all of the shipping. I don't recommend using them if you want good batteries.
1,"Batteries seem fine, box they came in was completely torn up and open.",I hope they weren't used. Will report back in a few months after use. Time will tellif they are legit.
3,Exact same as CopperTop. Don't be fooled.,"I was researching what the best battery is for my Maglite flashlight and started looking at mAh ratings of batteries. I went to the Duracell website to their technical specifications pdf gallery that showed ""actual"" test results of the batteries at different discharge rates over time and temperature. The specs and results for the Coppertop and Procell D cell were IDENTICAL! Not close or similar, but IDENTICAL. The temp ranges, voltage ranges, internal resistance etc were the same. One can only assume that the cases are the only difference. So if you are looking for a battery for... well anything... don't pay the extra for the Procell. Just buy whichever Duracell is less expensive.Also avoid Energizer rechargables. They are just AA batteries in a special housing to fit in D cell and don't have any extra capacity."
5,Long Lasting,"These Procell batteries are very long lasting and I did a price comparison and it is the best bang for your buck. They advertise a 5 year shelf life that I cannot speak to. They come packed very well from the factory in heavy boxes that will hold up well until you use all of them. I highly recommend this battery due to the fact it is long lasting is a very good buy. Thank you Amazon for a win win situation for customers.For my money you cannot buy a better battery and it comes in all the popular sizes,AA,AAA,C,D and 9 volt. I use all of them. I have read on the internet this is the only battery that NASA will use do to its reliability."
1,"Worst shipping and doesn't answer emails,buy from another seller!","I was in hurricane Sandy in NY and specifically asked in 4 separate emails to please hurry as I will even pay for expedited ship if needed.They answered one out of 5 emails and swore it would be in my hands 4 days from when I emailed.It took almost 2 weeks! By that time every store in NY had D cell batteries in stock,I was in a bad situation yet every other company shipped on time except these people.I have written many reviews and this is my first complaint out of hundreds of purchases online.That in itself says it all.Batteries were ok,they are batteries,not too much to mess up but non existent email answers and slow poke shipping is why I will stay away and you should think if you need batteries fast,look elsewhere!"
4,Good Batteries,I have only used these batteries for a few day however they are working great. It took several days to receive however once they arrived they worked just fine.
3,The Meaning of a Christian College,"In response to the review above, I believe some explaining needs to occur. The official definition of a ""Christian College"" as generally accepted across higher education is any school who only hires Christians as full-time employees. The accrediting organization for these Christian schools is the CCCU (Coalition of Christian Colleges and Universities). This book only reviews the 130(?) schools that are members of the CCCU. Both Catholic and Lutheran affiliated schools hire non-Christians thus they are not members of the CCCU.All that being said the book is okay, it does provide useful information about the schools it covers, but not more than you could find on their websites in 5 minutes."
2,False Advertising,"There are at least a thousand Christian colleges and universities in this country. This book is a guide to Baptist and Presbyterian and a few conservative Methodist and other Reformed church schools. There are no Catholic schools listed, no Lutheran schools listed, etc.As a Lutheran, I thought this book was a very bad purchase. I thought they would include Lutheran colleges (there are forty two of them, but not one of them is listed, nor are they even mentioned).Don't buy this book unless you are a very conservative Reform Christian, and want to know only about the hundred or so schools that come directly out of this tradition. Some of these are probably good schools, and I'm sure they are good people, but they aren't what I was looking for. I'd rather go to a Catholic or a Lutheran school since I'm a Lutheran (ELCA)."
4,Helpful but Itches Too,"Feels nice on your arm and helps with tennis elbow, or in my case, grappling elbow. But if you start sweating a little, the semi-furry inside material (blue) tends to make you itch."
3,Elbow Support,This product would suffice helping my tennis elbow problem but extremely small for a size large. wouldsuggest anyone buying this product to order one size larger than normal.
1,Too small,"I am an average size guy - this thing is labeled ""medium"" but is way too small. Buy a different one."
3,Not bad,"Bought this to help relieve pain in my elbow that turned out to be nerve damage and this wouldnt have helped anyway. I will tell you it fits great and it easy to get on and off. Ordered from amazon and as usual, received it very fast. I would recomend this for athletes as elbow protection without the stiffness associated with a brace."
3,Not that good,"I use this sleeve for my jiujitsu training and it's far from perfect. The two things that I don't like about this is that it usually ends up slipping down when wearing my gi jacket (the inner fabric lacks ""stickiness""). The other thing is that that inner fabric sometimes leaves some small particles of thread on my elbow."
4,"Confortable, but not tight enough","I am an average to above average guy when it comes to arm size. I bought the large and although it fits well and is very comfortable, it's not really tight enough to provide the support I need. Granted, if I got a smaller size I think it would be too tight. I think it's more for keeping the area warm and providing some support for everyday use. I wanted it to provide support for throwing footballs, which it can't. If I wear this and one of the strap type elbow braces like the Futuro, it's great. i would recommend this for recovery or everyday support."
3,This elbow brace is okay,"I bought my husband an elbow brace at the drugstore and regretted it. So, I logged onto Amazon and read the reviews here. This brace looked like it might be combined with the model I bought at the drugstore to provide enough support. It worked okay, not great and not bad, with the other brace. On its own, it wouldn't have been enough.I also ordered another type of armband that did very well. My husband has relied more on that other armband than this one."
4,Quick ending...,I really liked this book and can only say that I have one problem with it. It's the ending....I would have loved to see a wedding with the twins and the entire Monaghan family attending....just ended too abruptly for me....
2,didn't see the chemistry between hero and heroine,"The hero was extremely rich, handsome, and smart. The heroine was very poor, came from a huge family, and was a talented artist. I just didn't feel the chemistry between the 2 characters. He watches her paint a little bit, she insults his clothing, his lifestyle, and his friends and suddenly they are in love.There was a LOT of focus on family members like the hero's great aunt and the hero's nephew and niece. Then there was a lot of unpleasantness with the ex-girlfriend of the hero.The author was a good writer, I just did not like the story she was telling."
3,It was okay....,"I liked the book, but I didn't like how it ended. I think that Gen should have told Alex about Sydney's phone call and confronted him on it, and at least heard what he had to say. Instead of lying to him and then leaving. Overall, the book was fairly good."
3,Glasnost 1988,"The entire official 1986/87 album officially approved by the Soviet Union for release in the west of U.S.S.R. rock music. Soviet rock bands approved for use during the the era of Glasnost (""openness"").""Mirage"" by Cruise""The Race"" by Alla Pugachova""Music Under The Snow"" by Alla Pugachova""Yellow Boots"" by Bravo""White Night"" by Forum""Find Me"" by Alla Pugachova""Small Incident"" by Sofia Rotaru""Winter"" by Creators""I Do Believe"" by Bravo""Honest John"" by EVM"
5,Completely underestimated,"I am disgusted at how completely underestimated this album is. As I glance at some of the 160 reviews given to ""Kind of Blue,"" and them I read the whole 8 given to Birth of the Cool, it baffles me. I'll be honest, I have not heard ""kind of blue,"" although I do plan to, but Birth of the Cool is incredible. How dare someone say it does not represent cool jazz. It IS cool jazz. It is perfect. Gerry Mulligan and Miles Davis (and the rest, of course) are unfathomably incredible! This album is wonderful, stupendous, perfect or what ever one can call it, but, in the end, it all comes back to just plain, old-fashioned ""good."" This album evokes goodness and quality that is so long forgotten in todays poppy, MTV-centered world. Just listen and love..."
3,Not Cool Jazz yet but on its way,"While this record is interesting historically, the title is misleading because it's not really what came to be called ""Cool Jazz."" It's an original but transitional record. Miles started coming into his own with his different small groups after this record, culminating in ""The Musings of Miles"" which featured the first saxophone-less version of THE classic ""Cool Jazz"" group. While I only listen to ""Birth of the Cool"" once in a while for curiosity's sake, I've listened to the small group records hundreds of times more. There's just something magical about them missing here."
2,Maybe that is what Jazz is all about?,"I must admit I was a little disappointed in this. I expected more than just instrumentalists improvising and playing as fast as they can. That is all this CD is... it makes every song sound basically the same. I felt no beat, rhythm, or cohesion. Maybe I just don't understand classical jazz."
3,It wasn't what I expected,The book wasn't really what I expected. I knew it was a childrens book but not this extent. I counted around 607 words total in this book on 64 pages. That's about 9.5 words per page. More than half of the book is simply saying that anyone can benefit from meditation. Only about 6 pages were actually giving instructions. I thought this book would pack a little more in the way of content.
3,After the Promise,"Every bride and groomm believes the vows exchanged on their wedding day will hold them together forever. But, as the years pass, busy lives may extinguish the passion of those vows. Sometimes it takes a near tragedy to rekindle the love..and the promise.Debbi Bedford writes from the heart and allows her readers to share the heartaches and the joy of her characters. Her previous book, Just between Us, was acclaimed by reviewers.I was disappointed by this book. Normally I'm a fan of characters who reunite, but neither of the main characters were someone I could care about. They were selfish and uninteresting - the backstory of the child's therapist seemed far more promising."
4,Charges like it is supposed to,It charges my GPS like it is supposed to do -- anything less would be bit of a disappointment. It does seem to have every possible attachment for foreign travel. Too bad I only have North America maps on my GPS.
2,010-10723-00,"Nothing like the picture. The connector is not interchangeable as I thought (some adapters the connectors can be changed), it's just an adapter to connect to another adapter. otherwise, it works. Way too bulky for my taste."
5,Not only a charger!,"Unlike USB cable that allows the GPS to charge only, this adapter allows using it at the time when the device is charging. In my household the nuvi 750 GPS doubles up as MP3 player when we are not driving and I thought it was silly that Garmin did not include an adapter as a standard item."
1,Garmin Fail Purchased from Amazon,I took this adapter set with me to London and Paris. Straight out of the box it didn't work. Never powered up or anything. I got back the day after my 30 day return window- now I find out that I will only receive partial credit for an item that was DOA. Don't waste your time- buy a different charger or do what I ended up doing- using an international charger with USB support and take your computer cable with you. Thank goodness I did that.
3,does not fit nuvi 2450,"Item description only stated ""Compatible with nüvi series GPS navigators, except nüvi 3700 series (3750, 3760T, 3790T) GPS navigators"". The cable end does not fit my Garvin Nüvi 2450 at all -not even close. It looks to be a quality product if it will fit your device. I will go directly to Garmin and order the charger there."
3,not a perfect score,"The product fits together well, but if you lose the USA plug, you have to order another full set of plug attachments. It's sure cheaper than the clunky ""it will work "" replacement at Radio Shack."
3,Works as promised but...,"This is a useful product that does what it is supposed to do but one needs to be careful when pulling wire out of electric receptacle. There are several plugs (for various types of electric receptacles). The different plugs may pull of the charger's electric wire when one attempts to remove from electric receptacle. When this happens you are left with a ""live"" plug that needs to be removed from the receptacle without touching the bare contacts."
1,Garmin charger,I really can't review this product because I never recieved it. I have ordered it twice and both times it was cancelled due to improper shipping on your end. I filled out a survey on this before but have nor recieved a reply. Think I'll shop at another site next time.
2,"Works great, but shipping cost is prohibitive","The AC adaptor works well, although I primarily use my Garmin in the car with the car charger.Since this item comes from a 3rd party reseller, it is not 'bundled' with the GPS unit. So, the shipping charges added in make this a marginal purchase."
3,Manufacturer Specific Charger for cheap.,"Standard Garmin charger for their GPS devices. Works as far as I can tell, my compliant isn't the charger so much as the Garmin devices don't display the battery status on them anywhere.The charger comes with adapters for other countries, it's the type of plug that pretty much kills two sockets on a standard power strip as well."
2,Supposed to be a genuine Garmin product but...,"As this item was sold by Amazon, I trusted it was a genuine Garmin product (just like the product photo), however when I received it, I realized it was a generic charger with Garmin printed on it (very poorly)... 2 stars just because it works, however I don't know if it will compromise the durability of my Garmin GPS as it is not a genuine Garmin charger."
4,Garmin charging cable,Came promptly. Good service. havent had a chance to use it yet. has adapters on plug for european electrical outlets.
3,2 out of 4,only bad thing was that it didn't come with all of the adaptors it said it would. so i paid for all 4 pieces and only received 2.
5,Thumbs up,"neat accessory, works well, as it should. The charger is great but the Garmin model holds its charge much too short a time, needs mostly continuous power to workk reliably."
5,Alternate charging,I purchased the AC power cord as an alternate to charge the GPS battery over night. It came with different plug configurations depending on what country your in or visiting and are easily changed. I can also charge my GPS by using the computer interconnnect cable or the cigarette lighter plug. I tried it and it work just fine.
4,Great Ac Charger,"This is a great charger for my Garmin Gps, it is working fine and it is easy to carry it."
5,Foreign Travel,Exactly what I needed for our frequent travel overseas. I have Nuvi 760 which I will be using for auto and foot tours of Europe.
2,Could be better,The product works fine. I did not like their basic design approach. I would prefer to have the US two prongs permanent and the adapters plug in to the two prongs for different countries. I have other devices that use US to Europe prong adapters. The slide-in prong design is weak.
4,Nice to Have,"Nice to have, but not a necessity for motorists. Great, however, if you do a lot of route planning in advance, etc. Battery run time on my Nuvi 750 is up to 5 hours, so you really don't need this product unless you use your Nuvi alot for walking, bike riding, etc."
3,Packaging Doesn't List nuvi 750 as Supported,"The back of the packaging lists: StreetPilot i5, i3, i2, nuvi 680, 670, 610, 370, 360, 310, 270, 260, 250, 200, 250W, 200W. Only by checking the Garmin website for the nuvi 750, and in particular the item number 10-10723-00, was I sure that the AC charger I received was in fact for the nuvi 750. It was a little confusing."
5,Garmin A/C charger for Nuvi GPS,"Garmin doesn't include an A/C charger with their Nuvi 760 GPS. Since it is very handy to charge to charge the GPS unit completely before using it, I ordered this charger from Amazon. It is a genuine Garmin product (not aftermarket), works perfectly, and was priced lower than any other seller including Garmin!"
4,Nice to have when cigarette lighter fails,"I was glad to have this the last time I charged my Nuvi 760. The cigarette lighter in the car wasn't working at the time, and I was in a location where I didn't have computer access. I don't get those people saying it's not needed. As the old adage goes, ""...better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it."""
2,Not really needed,I bought this thinking I might use the GPS indoors but that was not the case. Used my nuvi 855 mostly in the car and the unit will also charge when connected to the computer. Great if you have to use your unit indoors.
3,Un-needed!,This adapter comes with the Garmin so I returned it for a refund. Nothing indicated this AC adapter was included with the Garmin GPS.
4,good deal!,This item meets all the necessary requirements for my needs. It arrived quickly and was used immediately.The price is very reasonable.
1,take it back,I bought this for my nuvi 2460. The rep. at garmin told me to buy it from amazon because it would cost me twice as much if I bought it from Garmin. I would rather pay more and not be disappointed. This charger does not fit and appears to be very cheaply made.
1,Don't waste your money,Very cheaply made. The tiny plastic clip that is supposed to lock the various adaptors broke off the first time I used it.
3,Excellent Adaptor,"Good adaptor to charge GPS at home. I don't give it a 4 or 5 since I had to manipulated it once or twice in my GPS to get it to charge from the outlet. Maybe my GPS is getting too old, its about 2 years now. But overall, works well. Haven't had problems other than mentioned above."
4,Garmin AC Power Cable (NUVI-GPS),The cable and attachments have worked perfectly thus far. Time will tell if the different attachments (plugs for 220 etc) will work with the constaint switching between different plug styles.
3,Garmin AC Charger with International Adapters for nüvi,I assume it is okay. I am returning it for a refund because I have no use for it now that I have returned from an overseas trip. The charger was delivered to my place after I was already traveling.
1,AC charger for Garmin,This particular charger is useless. Used it one time and it will no longer charge. Will no longer make the connection between the replaceable plug-ins.
4,It works,"I bought this for my gps! I was so happy that I found it since it didn't come with anything. Only bad thing is, it's difficult to plug in."
4,Garmin charger - nuvi,"Charger arrived very fast, very good condition. It is doing the job of charging, my only complaint has to do with the system not letting you know when it is fully charged when the unit is turned off.I purchased it to charge, and that is what is doing well."
5,Garmin A/C Power Cable,"The Garmin A/C Power Cable for the nuvi Portable GPS Navigators works as described. For most people they are probably unnecessary. However, if you travel to an area where you need to charge your nuvi using AC power, then this is what you want."
5,It works,"Factory charger for Nuvi. Mulitiple adapters, which I currently have no use for, but product is great."
3,Garmin AC Charger,The charger works well with my nuvi 855. It is so convenient to be able to charge the unit at home or in your hotel. I have not traveled to Europe yet so I can't comment on how well the international adapters work.
4,Garmin A/C Power Cable,Works great!!! A must for anyone who has a Garmin portable GPS device. It is nice now having to take it to my computer to charge. Now i can plug it in anywhere..even when on the road at a hotel. Don't need my laptop with me. They should supply the GPS units with one of these right out of the box.
1,Broken and cheaply made,One of the prongs on the main body of the adapter was broken when received. The prongs were made of a thin material that did not look like they would last long. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
5,Perfect Garmin Charger,"I spent a fair bit of time searching for Garmin AC chargers that worked well with the Garmin GPS units. There seem to be a lot of ones on the market that do not work well. I found this charger to be a quality item. I've had absolutely no difficulties with and it works exactly as one would want. I am using it on a Garmin Nuvi 255 3.5"" GPS unit. I purchased it here on Amazon from this seller because of the highly rated reviews by buyers. I'm completely satisfied with this AC Garmin charger."
5,AC Charger for Garmin Nuevi 2350,"You need an AC charger for the Garmin Nuevi 2350 because battery time is limited on the unit, in case you want to want to do extensive planning out of your carFrom my experience, the battery is better / fuller charged with the AC charger than with your car battery."
2,Disappointed,Short in it somewhere. Made trip miserable because it wouldn't keep the connection to the GPS. Giving it 2 stars because the company is being good about taking it back even though I did have to pay postage to return a faulty product. I do not recommend this item. Look for a more expensive one. It'll be worth it.
5,Very pleased,This is an actual Garmin product not some weird off brand like some of the other sites were selling. Works great and it arrived quickly. I just wish it would have been a standard item that came with the Garmin Nuvi.
4,"Plug it in, charges GPS. What else?","Not sure what to say about this AC charger, as it is just a charger after all. However...It has a cord about 5 feet long that is not removable from the charger. You plug one end into your Garmin GPS, and the charger into a wall outlet.If you are travelling in Europe (not likely for me) and you want to charge your Garmin GPS (I would not take my Nuvi 200 to Europe anyway as it has no European maps) you can use one of the supplied plug adaptors to fit various-style outlets around the world.I have only used the original DC car charger over the last few months, but as my car only has one socket that may be used for charging camera batteries on a driving trip, I figured the GPS may be on battery-power most of the day, requiring charging at night.Happy trails."
5,Garmin AC Power Cable,"I have a Garmin Nuvi 550 GPS portable navigation system. I wanted a wall charger, since I use it when I am walk around unfamiliar cities. This charger recharges the batteries in the US and Europe."
1,Garmin sells 3 AC chargers. This is for i2/3/5 and all Nuvi.,"010-10618-00 for StreetPilot c310 c320 c330 c340.010-10747-04 for StreetPilot c510 c530 c550 c580.010-10723-00 for StreetPilot i2/3/5 and all Nuvi.GPS may charge via USB. It's slower, but save $! :-Deal"
3,Garmin Nuvi in Europe,"We bought this for a trip to Europe and it worked fine on major highways at first. Then it started to scramble, we finally decided to reset everything and then it worked better.In villages and cities, it did not work that well. Got us in the general vicinity, but took us down wrong way streets, and tried to get us to drive down pedestrian only avenues. When we didn't follow directions, it scrambled again.Works better in US, but we already had that covered. This was specifically for Europe and it was not reliable. Plan to try it in Canada next week, because we know our way around there already. Just want to see if it works better than it did in France, Italy and Switzerland."
1,Ordering process screwed up,"When ordering this item, I was informed that it could not be shipped to a post office box so I gave my physical address. Item was then shipped via US Post Office to my physical address. Problem is that I don't receive mail at my physical address only UPS shipments. When item was very late (didn't ever arrive) I contacted seller only to find out they could not understand a rationale English sentence. I was also very frustrated that I could find no way to complain to Amazon about this mess. I have ordered a ton of stuff from Amazon but am now going to shop elsewhere until they resolve this issue to my satisfaction."
4,Block Rules,"I have been a fan of Lawrence block for years but somehow I missed his ""Tanner"" series. Filling in my library."
3,Slow but affordable,"This usb drive is fairly slow, but you get more memory for your money. Good for those who are not in a hurry."
1,"Quite Frankly, ""The Bite"" Bites...","`Hate to disagree w/ the other Reviewer, but this one was a major disappointment all around. There is nothing 'artsy' about it - it`s dull, badly subtitled, poorly acted and directed, and for a film that`s promoted as sexploitation, it has no slave girls, precious little nudity and no one you would EVER want to see nude. (This is the only good thing about it being B+W). And, it`s no better than 'Slave Widow', which also sucked but had a better story, and nowhere near as delightful as 'Madame O', which was far better than I thought it would be (read my review) after sitting through this cinematic swill... another example of deceptive marketing (Grindhouse Sexploitation Collection, my a#@), avoid this one completely, and ignore the other review."
1,Very Biased Writting and Reporting,"Not a book for individuals who like to come up with their own decision on the balance between Society's desire for wood products, and the professional talents brought to the forest to maintain sustainablity."
5,comment,Audio technique products judged to be of very good quality and reasonable price esw. Very good product. Very good sound
4,Another fine book from the author of In The Company of Mind,If you liked In the Company of Mind you should get along well with this. (There are some chapters posted on Baen.com if you would like a preview)An action-packed and self-consistant story of nanobots and biology with some interesting characters that you will wish to see more of.
4,Another fine book from the author of Corporate Mentality,If you liked Corporate Mentality you should get along well with this (There are some chapters posted on Baen.com if you would like a preview)An action-packed and self-consistant story of nanobots and biology with some interesting characters that you will wish to see more of.
3,Quite Pointless,"Okay, so while Suckers isn't the most inspired vampyre novel out there, it can hold its own. But i was especially disappointed in it, because while the auther didn't bring out the magificence of the vampyres, rather she made them look shallow and stupid. I've read a lot of better vampyre novels, but this is a pretty good flick, if you're bored. ..."
2,I was not impressed,"This book's saving grace was its incredibly witty sense of humor and internal dialogue. Dora is a twentieth century heroine, but that's all the good I can say about this book.As a reader of many, many vampire novels, I was extremely disappointed in the way Billson made vampire existence out to be: shallow, carping, and empty with none of the rich and captivating drama that Anne Rice or L.J. Smith portrays.Dora's whole existence seems to stem from her fruitless chase of a man completely unworthy of notice whom any woman with half a brain cell would have long since discarded. Her vampires are too caught up with their businesses, their ""nips,"" and their petty day-to-day problems to come across as anything besides pathetic. Violet is made up to be a vampire Barbie doll, and just about as intelligent.For a good read, try ""Queen of the Damned"" by Anne Rice. Best vampire book ever written."
5,Great price great speed,"Paid little for this comparatively, and got it in almost no time. Could not be happier, these particular watch batteries are a little hard to locate"
5,^_^! Grrrrrrreat! Pocket Monsters does it again!,"I love all the tracks on this CD, but my fave _has got to be_ ""Toi et Moi"". It just rules. That's not just cos I'm a Sakashipper...it just rules supreme. Anyway, the movie, the Cd...Pokémon in general, great stuff! Buy!"
2,stone sour,The Music was great but for some reason I was hoping it was the entire Through Glass CD. I opened it all excited and then relized there are only 3 songs:(
1,"now you see if, now you don""t",I ordered these boots and they said they were ostrich boots. When I received them there was no bumps on the boots. They were plain old cowboy boots. They were not what the picture projected them to be. Then I had to pay $26.00 to mail them back. I was not satisfied with them. It spoiled my Christmas.
1,Not at all like a mood ring!,"I purchased this item as a stocking stuffer for my 8yo daughter. She is infatuated with the whole mood ring phenomenon and this sounded like a fun and different mood ring type experience.Unfortunately, this goop is nothing like a mood ring. First, it does not change color when you hold it in your hand or against your skin, LIKE A MOOD RING. Second, it has only one color, pink, UNLIKE A MOOD RING.You must place it in the microwave for a few seconds or in the freezer for a few minutes to get it to change from pink to clear/opaque and vice versa.Very disappointing, especially when the $4 price tag doubled because of the $4 cost of shipping. $8 bucks for basically a little tub of slime.Don't waste your hard-earned money on this stuff!"
1,Not as described,"I thought this would be neat for my sons science birthday party, a fun goo that all the kids can touch. I was really hoping it would change colors like it said, BUT IT DOESN'T! Very disappointed. I got two tubs, which were smaller than what I thought. One pink and one purple. My son put his in fridge and it just got a bit darker. Put in the microwave and it turned blue. (btw the directions say to do this) But it does not change to the touch like it states! Even the blue now does not want to change back. It does not work at all like a mood ring."
1,Don't Recommend it for Gluten Free Diets,"I was glutened by this product. It claims to be gluten free, yet at the same time it clearly states on this website, though not on the box, that this product shares production lines used by gluten foods. Didn't care for the heavy handed spices anyway. If your goal is gluten free, stay away."
5,Great mixed with rice and a can of rotel,"I use this every week for dinner. I mix a few ounces in with wild rice, a can of hot rotel tomatoes and it makes a great hearty tasting dinner. Just top with grated cheese and eat with tortilla chips."
4,"""Is sitting there on your bottom getting boring?""","Frazee's comical ""Guide for Babies of All Ages"" has a subconscious message behind the humor, meanwhile encouraging those first few steps that will open up a universe of new experiences, baby leaving the shelter of the familiar for the unknown. The roly-poly baby illustrated is tiny compared to everything around him, objects taller than him, but once he pulls himself up and begins that first, tentative journey, it is impossible to stop. Of course, there are a few cautions along the way, ""be careful of things that are wobbly; stay away from fragile stuff"". There are the usual setbacks, too-much too-soon and a tumble to the floor, followed by a howl and the effort to being again. Cleverly worded and cheerfully illustrated, this tongue-in-cheek guide is a delight, offering more food for thought than is first apparent. Luan Gaines/ 2006."
3,Good job,"First one appear broken in transit, It was replaced quickly and works fine now. Other than that it works great"
4,Will Dawn ever become friends with the mean Kristy Thomas?,"I think this is a really interesting book. This is a book when Dawn realizes that Kristy is jealous of her to be Mary Anne's other best friend. Mary Anne doesn't need Kristy that much anymore and that Kristy liked it much better without Dawn around. So when Dawn takes the job with the Barrett kids, she's sure that she can prove to Kristy want a fine sitter she is and that she is very nice. Then she discovers that the Barrett kids have problems. Mrs. Barrett is very disorganized and she just got through an unfriendly divorce. Dawn's determine to solve two things--what a fine sitter and good friend she can be to Kristy and win her friendship, and help the Barrett kids and Mrs. Barrett. Planning it out is easy, but how is she supposed to do it? Join Dawn and help her solve her problems!"
4,Good Job,"You will most def like this book. It's about an eighth-grader named Dawn Schafer that has to babysit for three kids: Buddy, Suzi, and Marnie. They are the Impossible Three to her. But it's not their fault; it's their mother's. She just suffered a divorce and is frazzled with a busy schedule and not to mention her three children. The house is messy, the children are sloppy, and Mrs. Barret still manages to pull herself together. Well, Dawn confronts her and says what needs to be done, but she says it without intruding on their family's matters. I liked the way that she did that. I also liked the way she became friends with Kristy, after all, she did sort of ""steal"" her best friend. But Kristy and Mary Anne are still best friends, and Dawn's Mary Anne's other best friend. It would've been better if they all became a circle of best friends, but that's okay. It could very well happen one day.Read the book! It rulez!"
3,Light & Entertaining,"I didn't like Dawn, the narrator of this installment. I did like the Barrett trio and their lovable basset hound, Pow. (I just love basset hounds).Dawn always seemed like a self-involved character who just can't accept much input from others gracefully. Although she bossed the kids' mother into being a little more organized (that was good), she tried throwing her weight around with other kids and that was not so good. I also didn't like the way she felt she should have a special welcoming ceremony into the club. She was not their only member."
4,WRONG TITLE!!,"Don't judge a book by it's cover - or it's title! The title ""DAWN AND THE IMPOSSIBLE THREE"" gives you an idea tht the Barrett kids are a real problem, but don't be fooled! The book should be called ""DAWN AND IMPOSSIBLE MRS. BARRETT"". She never gives Dawn baby-sitting instructions, leaves the wrong phone numbers and leaves the house a wreck, making Dawn feel that it's her responsibility to clean up! Her disorganization leaves Dawn in a mess when Buddy Barrett is kidnapped by his father. (He is returned in the end.) I am happy, though, that Dawn got everything straightened out in the end with Impossible Mrs. Barrett!"
1,poor!,I am very dissapointed at this book. It seems like this is a 4 year old book. But don't worry i am going to order more Baby Sitters Club this time with mysteries! I am really sad at this book=(
4,just like i remember,"i ate handi-snacks a lot when i was younger, they are still a decent little snack to hold me over until a meal. 12 boxes are a bit excessive, but had almost a year before they expired. recommended!"
4,Yep. Metal. Pipe. Black. I'm reviewing it.,"On all accounts, I can confirm this is a metal pipe, painted black with uneven coating and printing on the outside. It has threads. I'm not a plumber, but this looks to be what we need for a little hardware project. Yay!"
4,Pretty Ponies,"I bought this book for my mother, but I enjoy it as much as she does. The full color pages that are jammed full of art images, are endlessly entertaining. It was interesting to see how they went from concept to production. The photo quality is great. A definite must if you collect the figures. But would be appreciated by horse lovers, artists, or even as an idea book for a new style of merry-go-round horses."
4,Kids who love horses will love this book!,"My mother bought this for my kids, they range from age 4-10 and they love it! The artistry is amazing!"
3,Cagney and Lacey - not price worthy,"I recently viewed my dvd Cagney and Lacey Season Two. The first disk was fine, the second one was distorted when I tried to view it. There were were lines through the scenes and could not be seen with out interruption. I was very disappointed because I waited so long for it. I would like a replacement for it. Please see what you can do. I usually have good luck with my dvd's, this was a disappointment.Sue Bergosh"
2,Only 7 episodes,"Great show but it would have been nice to know up front that season 2 is just 7 episodes. I paid about the same amount for season 1, a full season, plus each episode was sub-titled (no sub-titles in season 2)."
4,I thought Burning Emotion was excellent.This is better.,"To start with I dont even know what got me so into Samson in the first place.Maybe it was the fact that Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden fame was once on vocals but then again maybe I was just curious and Samson sounded like a cool name for a band.But that aside get the Samson anthology.2 discs all songs are great.Burning Emotion but this one goes farther and has even more quality songs on it.Dont knock it.It will help your calendar out the whole year through be it spring,winter,summer and fall.Youll have some great memories with listening to it and you can keep it forever.Trust me.I got Room 109 and Earth Mother happily in my head right now.Long live music!"
5,A Beautiful Christmas Tradition,"I ordered this to read to my first grandchild in future Christmas'. Robert Subada's books are wonderful, they make the stories come to life. If my grandchildren love them as much as I do they well be read time and time again."
5,Family Treasure,I purchased this book to read and show to my grandchildren. They love pop up pictures. It brings the story to life. A book you want to pass on down the family.
5,A Treasure of a Book!,This beautiful book takes an old Christmas favorite and turns it into a book to be treasured for many years. The striking popout art enhanses the story in a magical way.
5,fantastic pop-up for Christmas,"Robert Sabuda is a phenomenal artist. His pop-up books are amazing, and this is no exception. Accompanying Moore's poem are 6 two-page spread pop-ups and 5 smaller. They are beautiful and creative, and will bring smiles to young and old.If you or someone you know enjoys paper engineering, you can't go wrong with this beautiful book."
5,Traditions abound,"My kids and I read through this book around Xmas time every year. The pop up art is detailed, larger than life, and a work of art. I would not recommend this for any child under five or for any child that does not have a delicate touch. It really is beautiful."
2,The Night Before Christmas Pop-Up - by Robert Sabuda,"I bought two other pop-up books by Robert Sabuda, a counting one and The Twelve Days of Christmas for my grandchildren and they (and me) simply loved them......the pop-ups were delightful and complimented the story line perfectly.....however, I was disappointed in the Night Befoer Christmas as I feel the pop-ups (they are unique) over shadowed the story."
2,Terrible Lifespan,I used these batteries in my Moultrie D55 trail camera. The lasted 10 days with only 37 photos and video. I think they were old inventory.Replaced with Energizers and got 35 days with a lot more pics and videos.
5,cool,well there batteries what can i say. hmmmmmthere good! haha i mean they do last long and there Duracell and i guess thats it xDthere good
5,Good deal,This was a good deal for me. These batteries were much cheaper than what I can get locally and have a good life span.
2,They dont last very long,I purchased these after they were the recommend batteries by the OEM of my game camera. I inserted the batteries and tested the camera. Turned it off and went to set it up 2 weeks later and when i turned on the camera the batteries had only 20% life left on them. Duracell stood behind their warranty and did refund my money for the purchase.
1,I have never experienced any other battery this BAD,"these lil fellows last anywhere from one month to a year, haven't a clue why. All the motion detectors in my home(8) beep when there is a weak battery with-in. Seams since I bought this brand my home has been beep'n its brains out. The cheap Ray-O-vac last longer. ""DON't waste your bucks!"
4,cheap a lot,"about the price is nice, when i use it.. .I can see how many hours can use in my wireless speaker..."
2,don't last,put in a game camera that had regular Duracells in that camera for 18 months. New Procells lasted 2 weeks. Not happy.
1,Hermanless Hermits,Please note that these are re recordings and not the original recordings and do not feature herman and only one hermit (barry whitwam) is on the cover and he didn't play on many of the originals. PLEASE do NOT confuse this product with the ORIGINAL HERMAN'S HERMITS. This is a shoddy remake and one star is the lowest rating but over rates this cd.Herman/ Peter Noone
1,"Very, Very unhappy","I was so excited to get this, but when I put it on and started to walk, I was broken hearted. It is not the original group, it is a singer that is NOT Peter Noone, if you listen to the voice you can tell, I knew on the first set of words out of his mouth, and its the whole CD that is that guy. If you really liked the original Hermans Hermits then this is not the one you want, even at this price."
2,A real let-down,"As far as outdoor humor writing, it's hard to compete with the rollicking humor of Patrick McManus. His characters are vibrant and enjoyable company. Many of these stores read more like high school essays...the kind that got a C. It was disappointing. I hate wasting my money but it would just be too expensive to write to each of the authors asking them to chip in and return my purchase price. Since I don't throw books out after I've read them, I've donated this one to a senior center. Maybe someone there will enjoy it and it won't have been a total waste of money."
5,Back on Broadway,"The Me Nobody Knows is a haunting book full of real-life stories taken from the lives of children of the 60's in the inner-city areas of New York. The feeling behind the words, if not the words themselves, are pure poetry, talking about things like the war-zone like live which they lead. These stories tell of our past- and our present. It was made into a musical on Broadway in 1969- and will be coming back in May. I urge everyone to go see it- I know that I am."
3,Christmas present,I was surprised to see that this paperback was music score. I did not realize this until I received this. I am debating on wether to return this or use to read the lyrics for the cd.
2,By Far His Worst Album,"I have been a fan of MM since '98 and I have to say that this album is a real let down. Almost every single song has a long guitar solo at almost the exact place every time, and some songs even sound similar to another before it! Out of the entire album, only about two or three songs really stood out as ok, nothing really blew me away.I'll give him points for his style change, which sounds like a record from the 70s, sadly however, most of the songs are just boring. I have liked all of his past records, Mechanical Animals is what made me a fan, but I just didn't care for ""Eat Me, Drink Me"" at all. Hopefully, the next CD will be better"
3,Weaker than expected,"As a Manson fan from the early days, I find myself pretty disappointed in this album. There are no real standout songs here, and even the stronger ones seem weak in comparison to anything from Holywood for example. I'm giving this 3 stars because I'm a fan in general, but I just don't see this getting much time in my player..."
3,"Eat me, Drink Me...Puke me!!!! What a mess!!!","Marilyn Manson is one of the most important artist of our modern day, and I certainly don't think anything he does is worthless. However, this is my least favourite MM album. I would describe the music as Rock n' Roll with an element of Goth Erotica. Sadley, many of the songs just don't catch, ...and the lyrics are far less interresting than prior Manson albums. The absolute best track on the album is ""Heart Shaped Glasses"". The so-so-Ok-barely good tracks are ""If I Was Your Vampire"", and ""Evidence"", and ""Red Carpet Grave"". The songs that kind of suck are ""You And Me And The Devil Makes 3"", ""Putting Holes In Happiness"", ""They Said That Hell's Not Hot"", and ""Just A Car Crash away"" and the worst song on this album is ""Are You The Rabbit?""....horrible song. Mostly a dissapointing album. Long time fans will probably feel more let down than others."
1,Manson at his Weakest,"As a huge Manson fan, I was hoping for some traditional crunchy and dark rock but this album, track after track, delivered nothing but depressing, slow, uncreative songs. Save your money."
3,Get the serial killers back!,"As evidenced on the last album ""The Golden Age..."", Tim Skold is simply not a great songwriter, and Manson, without Twiggy, Madonna Wayne and Ginger, is also lacking in the ability to write another great album like ""A.S."" or ""M.E"" (or even ""Holywood"" for that matter). This is basically an old-skool rock album, without most of the dark electronic flourishes that distinguished those earlier efforts. I couldn't even listen to the last album, so this is definitely an improvement, but is simply....rather....generic - and set apart only by Mary's unique vocals. If I were M.M., I'd be on the phone to John 5, ASAP!"
3,"maybe I just don't get it, or maybe I'm not emo anymore","Um... it just sounds like MM has sold out to me. Sorry but I liked MM and the Spooky Kids, and earlier music, when he really had something to say. Now it just sounds like whatever everyone wants to hear."
2,Manson must be tired,"this collection seems slower and darker than usual. After listening, I wondered if Manson was depressed over the recent breakup with his wife, and it was affecting his music's mood."
4,Roots sound.,"Great job on this album. Manson goes back to his roots sound of Smells like children and POAAF. The lyrics are great as usual, the songs are well done and Manson's voice is in top shape. Great album."
3,Boring Mason,"I liked some of previous Mason's songs. Classics like Fight Song, The Rock is Dead and others are very good.The Golden Age of Grotesque was a bit of a turning point in which he tried a different style and I liked it too. Actually, that is his album with the most songs that I like. This album however is not to my tastes. I find it boring, uninspired and repetitive. The lyrics are a bit better than previous ones, but they are not as aggressive or outrageous as before, so I can't see Marilyn Mason in there.Next time I will make sure I borrow the album from someone and listen to it well before buying."
4,It grew on me.,"As a longtime MM fan, I wasn't overly impressed with this album when I first heard it. I bought it for an eight hour road trip, listened to it for pretty much the whole way, and decided it was ok - not fantastic, not awful. Then, a few days passed without me listening to it and I popped it in the cd player again...and really liked it! I've been listening to it since and enjoying it more and more with each listen. True, it's not MM's best album ever (to me, Mechanical Animals & Golden Age of Grotesque are tied for best MM albums), but it is good and it gets better with each listen.Oh, I should mention that the lyrics are awful (same old, same old, just less clever/creative and perhaps more tired), but I for one don't listen to MM for the lyrics.If you are a fan, I think this is worth buying."
3,New Direction,"This album veers away from the familiar sound that Manson offered us in previous albums Holywood and GAoG, and as such is truly a breath of fresh air.What we have here is a more stripped down ""rock"" sound that works very well. More of a ""death-rock"" fell to it although i suppose its not a very appropriate tag for this music.Having said this, dont expect to be blown away by any of the tracks. The work is very solid- but thats about it- nowhere near the level of Antichrist Superstar or Mechanical Animals- in my opinion the twin masterpieces of the group."
1,Tedious,"I'm a big Manson fan, but the love affair stops here. Every song sounds the same. Slow and dull. I will be selling this CD to another sucker."
1,when ego reigns,"It's kind of funny. For someone who related himself to an antiChrist when his career really took off he sure is a fart in the wind now. For someone so in tune with Biblical imagery (supposedly), I wonder if he's drawn the parallel with the prideful fall of Lucifer with his musical career? Unless former band members are outright lying, it's pretty obvious the guy is an egomaniac who has shed all talent from his roster. I hadn't listened to him in years (LOVED S.L.C and A.S. while M.A. was only mediocre, as was P.O.A.A.F.) and really lost interest shortly after M.A came out but totally dropped him since. His releases showed some spark here and there, but now the fire is officially out. As other reviewers have pointed out, it's great to not release the same thing over and over, but he's done nothing but go downhill since leaving Reznor's guidance."
2,Thanks,"CD came quickly and in great condition. It's not very good, but the seller did great. Thank you!"
2,The Fall of Adam,"Sometimes I wonder if Marilyn Manson is acting out the main character from his Triptych. Trying to reach an all-time low to then resuscitate better than ever?This CD lacks substance. There is a lot missing from it that made his previous attempts works of art. The lyrics are not to par with the profoundness and thought that MM is known for. The songs sound ""catchy"" and ""trendy,"" and dare I say ""emo?""Please, Manson. Bring back your unique Industrial Metal/Shock Rock sound! Bring back the days of lyrics and material that was flourished with deep metaphors and symbols. Until then, MM will now stand for ""Mediocre Manson."""
3,Ehhhh,"Fair. Not as good as ""Mechanical Animals"" for sure, but some really good tracks.Best tracks:They Said That Hell's Not HotEvidenceHeart-Shaped GlassesThe Red Carpet Grave"
3,"Not his best, but enjoyable","Manson has once again reinvented himself. This album is far more low-key and a bit more personal than his previous albums and the theatrics are pretty much gone. Face it, it's a Brian Warner album, not a Manson album. The metal influences are mostly gone aside from a few tracks, the industrial influences are toned down, and the pop and gothic influences are pushed to the forefront. Honestly, there's moments where I thought I was listening to The Cure. The lyrics are about heartbreak and loss. They're not always eloquent and it's my least favorite Manson album lyrically, but it has its moments in terms of lyrics. The parallels to Lewis Carroll's books were rather interesting. Even though this isn't my favorite Manson album, it's nice to see a change after the by-the-numbers ""Golden Age"" (which was pretty good too) and I can say it was well-worth the 10 bucks.My favorite tracks:If I Was Your VampireHeart-Shaped Glasses (When The Heart Guides The Hand)Eat Me, Drink Me"
1,Commercial Sellout!! Horrible!!,"Besides Mechanical Animals, and this may be worse, this CD just plain sucks. I have officially given up on him. He is like Metallica at the end. Just a commercial sellout. It doesn't sound like anything that made his fans like his music. Manson used to have the greatest sound, from his voice and his screams, to his industrial sounding hard music. Now it is just stupid sounding wimpy music. Do not buy it!! Let him write music that made people like his sound. This CD SUCKS!!"
1,Astoundingly Lame,"I have been a BIG Manson fan for over a decade. I own nearly everything he's ever done, including singles, soundtrack cuts, etc.This album disappoints on so many levels I don't know where to begin.I'll keep it brief and say this: even having Tim Skold on board can't save this mediocre, bleary, dreary collection of tracks from collapsing under the weight of its own pretentiousness.It is uninspired musically, ponderous lyrically, and dreadfully performed. All of this can be blamed directly on Manson and Skold, who (according to the liner notes) were the ONLY contributors in those areas. That's right... no Pogo or Ginger Fish here.If you want exciting music in the vein Manson USED to make, I cannot recommend Tim Skold's unfortunately out-of-print ""Skold"" highly enough."
3,Not a Great Buy,"Wasnt that great of a CD it seemed like all he was really sing about in all his songs was about it past Girlfriend, Im a big M.Manson fan but i think he losing his touch in the music."
4,Not The Lyrics,"Every review here, weather it's good or bad, pertains to the lyrics. Who cares!!! Manson's lyrics have always ranged from totally childish goth nonsense to brilliant social satire. The music is what really evolves. I love the lyrics of Joni Mitchell, but hate the music, so that doesn't make her albums great, just smart. Besides, isn't the music what makes you feel good? On that note; This is musically his best effort. Who cares about lyrics?! P.S. - SKOLD is Brilliant!!!"
2,Reinforcing the stereotypes...,"To be blunt, this album is just not good. First of all, you all need to realize that Marilyn Manson IS NOT GOTH. He's a heavy metal artist. Makeup doesn't make you goth. I've never liked Marilyn Manson, but a friend burned it for me, so I gave it a listen. It's not an impressive album. With song titles like ""If I Was Your Vampire"", ""Putting Holes In Happiness"", and ""You, Me and the Devil Makes 3"", this album honestly sounds like Manson is parodying himself. It sounds as if he is trying to say things that sound ""goth"" but end up sounding like a tired, old, faker. If you want real goth that actually sounds dark, buy ""Only Theatre of Pain"" by Christian Death. Then you can see where Manson ripped off his vocal style from."
1,worst manson ever,i am a huge fan of manson but this album disapoints on every level.there is not one groovin song on the album.it is all slow melodic stuff.i thought his last album was the best yet.i expected so much more from manson and tim skold
3,Not What I Was Expecting,"Thankfully, we all like different things so I know there will be people out there that will love this album. But for me, it was very slow going when compared with ""Golden Age...""Okay, blah, blah ""you can't compare this release with the previous albums."" Well, if I didn't then I would have had to give it fewer stars. I know Manson can create some killer music, but this didn't seem to have that angry edge as before. Maybe he wrote this through heart shaped glasses (groan).""Mutilation..."" and ""You and Me..."" picked up the pace toward the end, but by then I had already made up my mind and two tracks weren't going to save the album for me.Manson is very creative, very talented and very intelligent which is why I was surprised he released this album."
3,Eat some pickles first,Evidence and the Grave song are more classical Manson. I really experienced a great let down with this album when you think of some of the artistic mastuh pieces Manson Marilyn has dun in the early years of her career. Holy Wood was better but I will take this. The sound on this CD is often flawed and be careful when buying this because I had to send mine back 3 times because there is a lot of static and scratches on it. even when i buy at best buy it is the same scratches. I think the cover of this cd is offensive because the eyes are different colors and people like that should wear eye patches ya know. Best experienced when eating pickles I have found. The next album is called Trinity Dominion and I already have it because 300 were released overseas so I ordered one. If you want to hear it you should because there are 5 new songs and 7 unreleased ones that she did from 1998 to 2003. She is very pretty though I do not know why Rose divorced her.
2,It must suck,"To experience suck a slow painful slide into obscurity. To have everyone realize that maybe you aren't really ""Marilyn Manson"" but you are in fact simply Brian Warner. That you thought your band members were interchangeable. That you could remain the same and the world would follow suit."
3,Good but not great,"I love Manson. My wedding introduction was to ""the beautiful people"". With that being said, this is not his best effort. It is something to listen to, but nothing special."
3,Select your song instead - Almost Goth,"There are three nice dark gothic songs on this. He is looking for some other titles to make the pop charts and others don't sound mixed correctly. Too much treble and distortion to really hear the bass and his voice. There is talent in the guitar player and his voice, but you might have to turn down your treble. Vampire and one of the last songs are great gothic tunes in line with Sisters. Very nice played loud with bass when I'm in the most negative moods."
4,Manson NEVER lets me down,"If you have followed Manson from the early years you will know he has always been interested in art and seems to constantly change on every album in some way shape or form. This album is no different, but he just took a drastic turn and toned it down and showed on this album that he doesn't need to scream and be hateful on every song to put out a good record. This album is not an over the top listen to every day type of album but when your in that mood to listen to some mellow Manson then pop this in... Good tunes!"
3,DISTURBINGLY Good...,"I have to admit Manson has impressed me. At one point I thought he was a flash in the pan, shock jock. I felt AntiChrist Superstar was his ace in the hole and that he was on a rapid decline ever since. But ""Golden Age of Grotesque"" was a pleasant surprise. Heavy, original and chock full of hooks. Then he follows that solid effort with ""Eat Me Drink Me, a somewhat more subdued, dour affair dealing with the sudden end of a personal relationship. ""Eat Me Drink Me"" is good, though it requires a couple listens and is quite depressing. But the songwriting is excellent, the lyrics, riffs and melodies are very cool and the guitars sound wicked. Manson is one of the few artists in rock that has gotten better with age and experience even if those experiences are not always pleasant for him..."
4,His Best Since Mechanical Animals,"Great Manson CD - nearly the caliber of Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals. I am not much of a fan of the later albums (Holywood, Golden Age Of Grotesque), so it is refreshing to hear some substance in the new album."
3,His weakest effort since...ever,"There are some redeaming songs here (""you and me..., and ""mutilation..."") but overall this feels turgid and without focus when compared to his prior 2 albums."
2,Very pessimistic feelings by hearing it,I don't know about you guys but i feel so dragged down by hearing this album.There are some good lets say melodies but in general its so boring and depressive - i don't know if i have to listen this album and cry about something. This is his worst album and i recommended only to collectors of marilyn mansons music
2,Who are you and what have you done with Marilyn?!,"Any fan of Mr. Manson's work has watched him grow and change as an artist with each album showcasing just how much better he has become. However, Eat Me, Drink Me has me completely stumped. It's not good in fact it's not even just ok. The overall feel of the album is one of radio-friendly shallowness, not to mention that it is very hard to tell when one song ends and another begins. It sounds processed like most of the new bands out there...not at all like the Manson we all know. All I can really say is this album has proved to be very disappointing."
5,Mind blowing as always,"In over ten years of listening to Manson, he is yet to come out with a disappointing album. This is another brilliant variant on the classic Manson style; another scar on the face of the world."
3,"Eat Me, Drink Me","Eat Me, Drink Me being Manson's 6th studio album and 2007 release sounds like alternative rock with elements of industrial rock. Two singles were released from this album ""putting holes in happiness"" and ""heart-shaped glasses"". The problem is that this sounds like a very ordinary alternative rock album and only occasionaly does one gets glimpses of industrial rock. All the lyrics are included in the book along with many photographs of Manson and the band. Allmusic gave this album 3/5 as did Rolling Stone. I agree and give it the same grade. 3/5."
4,A New Direction for Manson,"When I first heard ""Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)"" some months ago, I was taken aback a little. Obviously Tim Skold is a big influence on this album. Guitar solos, when there never were. It's a completely different atmosphere. All the songs were performed by just Manson and Skold. No band. So this a new era for Manson. The sound on this album is almost (in some places) reminiscent of his early stuff. All and all it is a solid album and takes a few listens to get use to."
5,Great CD,"Its not your outlet if you're looking for something just balls out hardcore like The Golden Age of Grotesque. Where The Golden Age of Grotesque was Manson's ego CD, Eat Me, Drink Me is its polar opposite. In this CD he opens up and just spills it. I'm having relationship trouble recently and this CD made so much more sense when I felt like my heart was torn out. I actually had to shut it off because I couldn't deal with the raw truth of it all. So amazing, I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in pure and true art."
2,Washed up?,"Without Trent Reznor or Twiggy, Manson has been showing signs of weakness, this new CD lacks any force that we have seen on his other great works. Over-all this CD felt generic, washed up and I want my money back."
2,Ice cream cone with worms,"I love MM. Though this CD left me cold. He seems to be going through the motions. This piece was like an ice cream cone with worms on top. The lyrics were good. The music, fluff. MM should rethink it and bring Trent Reznor back to produce an album.... get back to some serious roots."
3,MANSON A BIT UNDER THE WEATHER,"IN MY PERSONAL OPINION, MECHANICAL ANIMALS WAS BRIAN WARNER'S BEST WORK. I WAS 17 AT THE TIME AND THAT ALBUM DEFINITELY CHANGED MY LIFE (IM NOT SURE FOR GOOD OR BAD). MECHANICAL ANIMALS WAS ALL ABOUT SELF DESTRUCTION AND EMOTIONS. EAT ME, DRINK ME IS MANSON VENTING HIS BROKEN HEART. I AM SURE HE WILL GET HIMSELF BACK TOGETHER AND PRODUCE QUALITY WORK ONCE MORE. BUT MOST OF ALL, HES DEFINITELY A LEGEND."
5,A Great Manson CD,"This is one of the best Manson CD's that I have listened to and I have them all. Some of the best songs on the cd are Putting Holes In Happiness, The Red Carpet Grave, They Said That Hell's Not Hot, Evidence, and Mutilation Is The Sincere Form Of Flattery. The guitar riffs are catchy and a lot of songs have guitar solos now. The lyrics are great - you can really tell that Manson is trying to express himself and trying to get his anger out. If you are trying to compare this CD to the previous ones like Antichrist Superstar then you will find it different but it does not mean its bad. This is an awesome CD and I highly recommend it to everyone who is into rock/metal music ... not just Manson fans."
1,A sleeper,This is boring. All the songs are slow. There's no punch. And that album cover . . . did he take that picture with a kodak disposable and photoshop it himself? Ughk - dissapointing.
1,"awful as usual, actually even worse than usual","Another nail in the coffin of goth. Manson should give it up. He was bad enough in the nineties (the pearl jam of goth my friend says but i never really considered him true ""goth"", just an opportunist.) another unoriginal. So sad so sad."
1,"Waste of money, waste of time.","I agree with Michael D. Cruz. Marilyn Manson has no voice whatsoever, and he has horrible music to match it. I listened to the samples of this album, and I was left confused. How in the world do people like this music? (It's not even music, actually! It's a revolting shaky voice belonging to a revolting ""man"", who just wants popularity and thus creates a horrible CD with he calls music.)Not worth the money, not worth the time even!-Elina Oliferovskiy"
1,CAUTION! This part does not fit all 2005 Camrys.,"WARNING! I purchased this part for a 2005 Toyota Camry LE 4 cyl., but it does not fit! The item is specifically listed for the 2005 Camry. Comparing this filter to the one I removed from my vehicle, showed that they are dramatically different. I returned this item to Amazon, and subsequently purchased the correct part that fit, at a much higher price from my local Toyota dealer. Be warned my dealer informed me that there are 2 types of filters for the 2005 Camry. One is for the 4 speed automatic Trans., and there is a filter specifically for the 5 speed OD Trans. that I have. This filter might work on the 4 speed auto. Trans. But it will not fit the 2005 Camry with the 5 speed OD Trans."
4,"A great read, with something for everyone.","This book is drawn from a series of newspaper columns, and is about as wide-ranging as a gambling book can get. There are basics on how to play the games, blackjack basic strategy, tips on playing the slots, and a fun look at tournament play, with the author actually playing in tournaments and reporting back on the experience and his results. There's also a tear-jerker of an interview with a recovered compulsive gambler. I've read several of this author's books, and they're all browsers' books. Flip open almost anywhere, and you'll find something of interest. They're all also really well written and fun to read."
2,Not so great,"I really don't have any use for this book. There are no suggested ages for the books being a read-aloud. The youngest that these book suggestions can be *read* is third grade.I'm also unhappy with the exclusion of ghost stories and the like. I know there are people who would love these suggestions *because* of the exclusion. I'm not one of them, and there was no warning about it. I feel that I've wasted $12 that would have been better spent on another book. I highly recommend ""Honey for a Child's heart"" rather than this book."
3,a heartbreaking story of china,I love the story which make me cry and I also come from china and have the similar situation which the author has. I wish her well in the future and bring her daughter to canada.Her father is a capitalist who died so young after communist revolution.she endure the real bitterness in china.
1,9V batteries,"The batteries when received read 9.54 volts and were installed in a wireless burglar alarm system. After 1 day various zones began to fail. Eventually all zones failed and battery voltage measured was at 8.46 volts. I called Amazon and they will issue a full refund. Cudos to Amazon but be aware of possible shelf life problems with batteries.Procell Alkaline Batteries, 12 Batteries per Pack, 9V (DURPC1604) Category: General Batteries"
3,Average quality,"I bought a box of these for our hand-held mics at our church. They're of average quality and lifespan, not nearly as good as the Duracells we've used in the past, although their a fair amount better than the 'budget' batteries from the likes of The Shack (formerly known as Radio Shack). The price seems good, but only some true scientific method of testing battery life vs. cost would reveal if you're actually saving any money. If you've got a fifth grader who needs a science project, that might be worth it. I'll probably be going back to Duracell batteries when this package runs out."
1,Procell deadcell,"Contrary to purported performance claims, my experience with these batteries has significantly worsened my opinion of Duracell's products. Decades of experience with Everready Energizers - and with other Duracell products (e.g., Coppertops) - show ProCell products to be markedly inferior in performance. Regardless of how long their shelf life may be, they simply haven't performed up to par, much less equally to other Alkaline batteries.This has just been my experience - over daily use, over many months, with set after set of ProCell AA batteries. Take it for what its' worth."
4,Great Price; Decent Batteries!,"I've used these inside professional wireless microphones, mostly because when I was visiting a professional Hollywood set, I saw this is what they were using. The batteries seem to last a good while, and were reliable for me. Compared to regular retail 9v, they cost much less. So if it's good enough for the movie set I visited, then it's good enough for me. It worked well; and I'd probably buy them again."
5,Long lasting batteries with good shelf life,"I use these in two cordless over the ear microphone transmitter which is used for 3 hours per week. Each battery lasts several weeks of use, but after half a year of storage there is no noticeable decrease in battery life."
5,Great batteries for our church,We use these batteries in our wireless mics at our church. They seem to last twice as long as any other battery we have tired so far. they were recomended to us by a music group we had preform at our annual Christmas party.
5,great price,I just started using my betteries so I cannot speak about long term performance. But the price is right and from a good brand.
5,Great product at a good price,"Used in professional audio equipment (mixer, wireless etc). Reliable, good life in high drain devices. You can store them for long periods of time without any real loss.Little plastic caps to protect the battery leads are great for identifying new/used batteries in my kits."
3,NOT TOO GOOD!!!,"We purchased these batteries for the wireless mic at church, but so far the performance is not a good as a copper top. They work ""just o.k."" but we were hoping for better.Not sure why they are calling them ""professional"".........Comparing the cost and the length of use of these and the others it may work out to the same price. Not sure on this .Will probably just stick to the copper tops!!!!!!"
4,Duracell is ok,"As noted in my review of another Duracell product: Batteries should greatly improve as new technology is developed and applied. Meanwhile, Duracell batteries do the job. Better (longer lasting) products are on the market in Europe, however, as long as buyers choose cheaper products over cost effective alternatives, I'm not looking for longer lasting batteries around here - because that would cut into earnings and profits."
4,Procell Duracell 9 volt battery,"Just started using batteries in church sound system (cordless microphones). So far so good; I don't know how long these will last. Hopefully longer than the more expensive 9 volts that I purchased locally. I purchased these due to the reviews of users from Amazon and the price. Thinking of purchasing for home use, i.e., smoke detectors, etc."
4,For collectors only -- there is nothing new on this CD,"If you are a fan of all things TUBES, then you will want to buy this just out of support for the band (or at least the royalties-earning songwriters in the band). This CD contains several tracks from the ""Tubes World Tour"" CD, several from the ""Dawn of the Tubes"" CD, and one track from their debut CD.And that's it. No more. Nada. Nothing. (...)Actually, there is one SLIGHTLY different version - the song ""Whiz Quiz"" sounds just a bit different from the version on ""Dawn of The Tubes"". I think this version is a studio cut and the ""DoTT"" version is a live in-studio version. The difference is only barely noticeable, but it's there(...)I bought it because I am a fan and I am pleased to see ANY release by this under-appreciated band. For the casual fans or potential new fans, this CD is not the way to go."
5,Trial By Fire is Awesome,Trial By Fire is another awesome CD put out by Journey. After a long break they all reunited to but out this awesome CD. Mixed with Great rock and beautiful ballads. You will not go wrong with this CD. A must for all 70's and 80's music lovers!
5,"Truly Awesome, Steve Perry come back!","I can't get over the beauty of this cd. I still love it after all these years. My favorite song is Easy to Fall. The harmony is beautiful. Though some would have liked more rocking songs, Journey is at their VERY best singing the ballads. Sorry guys."
3,Bad Mistake!,This sounded more like a Vanessa Williams record.Steve wanted to sound very contemporary. Actually a cover up for not being able to sing the same way he did in the late 70's. He attempted to change the sound of the band so he can stay...and then record ballads left and right. I wanted to hear them rock again and not to contribute to a Disney Movie soundtrack. Michael Bolton and Richard Marx rocked harder than Journey here. Not a good record for Journey but a decent album for Steve Perry. If it is any consolation Steve Smith is so good and also some guitar god playing from Neal Schon but very few.
2,Journey - 'Trial By Fire' (Sony),"Apparently,their last work with frontman Steve Perry and quite the let down.'Trial...' was the band's '96 comeback attempt,but if I remember correctly this CD was a stiff from the get-go.I tried SO hard to get into this fifteen track disc,but even with a duration of 68 minutes,I just couldn't.The songs don't completely suck,they just don't appear to have much life.Fantastic cover,don't you agree?If you're an old school Journey fan,I encourage you to check out their new 2005 release,'Generations' with vocalist Steve Augeri,who's been with the band for awhile now.That CD is surprisingly good,as I'd give it 3 1/2,maybe 4 stars.Keep in mind that guitarist Neal Schon is their 'key' player."
2,Waste of talent,"It should first be noted that Journey is a wonderfully talented group of musicians. So this cd, for all its inadequacies, is a great sounding disc. The production is crystal, the guitar work is perfect, and Steve Perry, by all measures, is in great voice. However, I am amazed that a group that clearly appears to be trying so hard, could produce such an inconsequential album. The crux of the problem is in the songwriting. No amount of great production can save this collection of bland offerings. The lone exception is the heartfelt ""When You Love A Woman"", which follows admirably in the footsteps of great Journey ballads like ""Faithfully"" and ""Why Can't This Night Go On Forever"". The other songs are beset by overwrought lyrics and vanilla melodies. Worst of all, the band seems to be having no fun at all. This album is a lone blemish on a great catalogue of music by a great group."
2,A Disappointing Reunion For Sure!,"Wow! I bought this CD for a few bucks used and I still feel cheated. I expected so much more from this 1996 reunion (short-lived) CD and got so much less. Tracks 1,3 and 4 have started to grow on me but as another reviewer pointed out, the rest is mostly unlistenable. I don't know if Journey toured to support this album but as I was listening I found myself imagining the lukewarm reactions of concert audiences everywhere as Steve Perry announced ""and now we'd like to play something off of our new album"" ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzz. I recently saw the new Journey in concert with current singer Steve Augeri. It was great. He sings like Steve Perry used to be able to sing in about 1980. My recommendation is to skip ""Trial by Fire"" and go straight for Journey's 2001 release ""Arrival"" with the new Steve."
2,Poorest of all Journey albums with Steve Perry,"This sounds like a downgraded version of Perry's 1994 solo album ""for the love of strange medicine,"" which by the way was very good. You can feel the tension among the members of the band, here, that spoils the chemistry. Boy, what a long collection of unmemorable, plain dull songs. I can maybe salvage three tracks here: the single ""when you love a woman,"" mid-tempo rockers ""If He Should Break Your Heart"" and ""Forever in Blue,"" None of them, by the way, equal the poorest track from their previous album ""Raised on Radio.""And I don't know how one can explain the very poor production here given they had a huge comeback budget to record and promote this thing. I spent the full price back in 96 for the original release. What a shame. I would rather go ahead and download the extra track, another decent one, that Mr. Perry wants me to shell out another 15 buck to have. Very small minded thinking, whoever decided it."
2,Second listen just reinforces what I already knew...,"This is by far the worst Steve Perry era Journey albums. I have them all except this one, which I purchased and sold years ago. Decided to give it another listen when I saw there was a remaster with a bounus track. Unfortunately, my opinion of it remains the same. For the most part it is an adult contemporary album which in my thinking is just NOT Journey. Message of Love is the only real exception of note. If this was the group's new direction then they must have taken a u turn and some B12 on 'Arrival' because it has sooo much more energy. The musicianship is watered down on 'Trial by Fire' for the sake of hearing Steve Perry's voice I'm guessing. Sorry but a voice, even one a great as Perry's, cannot make a song by itself. For those of you who still pine away for Perry this is what you would be getting. More adult comtemporary. No thanks."
2,"Very disappointing. I wanted to like it, too.","In 1996, Journey was convinced ($) to get back together again to do a reunion album. As my wife and I got married the same week this was released, this was a natural pickup, since we'd both liked Journey in the past. ""Escape"" Journey was putting out a new album. Problem is that the album is a bore. The first three songs are good, but after that, it's mostly unlistenable. That was a shame, as we both loved Journey a lot. It also has a god awful horrid album cover.I would have given it just one star, but I really do like the opening first song a lot, and tracks 2 & 3 are pretty decent, too."
3,A good come back for Journey.,"Even though their 1996 reunion was short-lived,this album shows that when great musicians get together the results can be quite spectacular-this is evident in a number of cuts on this album which are instant Journey classics.At the same time,I believe,this record suffers from an overabundance of ballads which somehow break the momentum leading to an overall lukewarm impression after every listen.Perry is in great vocal form,Schon is as impressive as ever,Cain builds massive keyboard backrounds,while Valory and Smith provide a very tight rhytm section;especially Steve Smith's 'jazzified'drumming stands out.A very strong comeback,yet it needed more songs with a punch and a slimer selection of slow numbers."
5,Pause for a moment to mourn the loss of Steve Perry,"Steve Perry's last album with Journey. It is a really good album. I hadn't heard it before and am not really familair with any of the songs but listening through it - the album is polished and sounds great. I had it in a stack of old and new - it totally held up and the songs stood out as hey what a great song (""When You Love a Woman"" stands out especially). I think it brought some of the fire and punch of ""Bad English"" to Journey. The songs make you feel sad, happy, and all the emotions of a great Journey album with all the variety and twists and turns of great songwriting. Pause for a moment to mourn the loss of Steve Perry to the band. With 16 great tunes on a single download, it is well worth the price!"
4,Classic Journey,"This album is great! I am a Journey fan, so I am happy to listen to all of their music.I rate this one on the same level as the Escape album. They are both worth every penny!!!"
4,Journey,I was very happy with the products I received and the timely matter in which I received them. THANKS!
2,The neutering is complete,"Steve Perry finally completed his neutering of the band. Every song is so slow and sticky sweet it makes me want to vomit. Not one song has any of the REAL Journey kick. I'm sure if you're one of the fans who only likes Journey for the ballads then you will eat this up. For me Journey was more about good classic rock like Stone In Love, City Of The Angels, Keep On Running etc. You will not find anything like that here."
3,Good but not great.,"I found this album to be good Journey, but not one of their great ones. I thought the were too many ballads and not enough of their faster tempo driving tunes. Even though Steve Perry is not singing, I think that their new release Arrival is much better."
5,Truly a great one.,"I totally disagree with most of the reviews of this album here as I think it is one of the best melodic rock albums released the last fifteen years or so.It is truly a treat for the heart and soul packed with good songs,delicate arrangements with a stellar production.It has come to be one of my ""desert island discs"" and I truly love it.Maybe it has something to do with being a musician and songwriter myself who knows but if you like Journey you'll enjoy this album as well as the others.Too bad the Steve Perry-era ended with this one."
2,"Kind of weak, but pleasant anyway","This album sounded uninspired. Don't get me wrong, I love Journey, and I have this album. The two best songs are the first and last (a bonus track). ""Message Of Love"" sounds like a leftover from Frontiers. The musicianship on this CD is tight and performed well. It's just that it is kind of boring, I expected a little more. It couldn've happened with another release WITH Steve Perry. I knew that if they had one more chance after Trial that we'd have a 4 or 5 star album on our hands. Unfortunately, that isn't gonna happen."
2,"It's nice, it's sweet, but it doesn't kick","It's this simple: There is no ""Bang"" to it. Steve is back, he sounds great, but it's almost a good thing he didn't tour with them behind this album. It's got no ""cojones."" Steve Smith must have needed the money, that's all I can say. I remember Journey from the 1980's, when one of those albums could be heard being played LOUD just about anywhere you went. Well, this one COULDN'T be played loud. No chance. It will be heard in elevators worldwide, in the lobbies of airports, and on all the ""soft rock"" stations. Unless you like Barry Manilow, Neil Diamond, and George Michael, you will not like this. BRING BACK THE REAL STUFF, GUYS! THEN SEND YOUR CURRENT SINGER ON A ONE-WAY FLIGHT BACK TO SINGAPORE, AND GET STEVE BACK! WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU WAITING FOR?"
2,"Really, quite bad...","This is horrid. I mean, if you appreciate the melodic rock of Evolution you will be appalled at this. The heavy hand of Steve Perry just ruins the effort. Bad."
4,The Very Last Journey,"The music Journey has captured in their long career, was finally shut down in its last end. Trial By Fire, was the final album with lead vocalist Steve Perry.The songs here are captured elegantly. Unlike any other Journey record, this consisted of a true sense of the music. Songs like It's Just The Rain, and When You Love A Woman proved to fans that Journey would come alive again.While Perry and Journey split for good a couple of years later, the magic that they have had will always be ignited. Trial By Fire, shows that gift in the fullest bloom."
2,The case arrived broken,"The case arrived broken, unable to use or protect the Cee Dee, The CD was okay but the case is ruined"
2,ballast blows out after two years - outlet loose connection,Bought from Home Depot {twice }. Both times the outlet wouldn't hold on to the plug.After about two years {both times} the light stopped. Wasn't the lamp but theballast itself. T8 lamps no very reliable .
3,Too dense!,"This book is too dense for my needs. If you need to read liquid platinum about Japanese gardens, go for this book. If you need a quicker hitter, go elsewhere."
2,BORING!,"I can't believe I read this whole thing. The entire plot can be described in the two paragraphs that the video of the movie adaption uses. IN between there are over two hundred pages of ""isn't Querelle a naughty sailor"", ""oh look he's gay too"", ""check out the ass on that guy"". I remember liking Genet's plays but this is an excercise in overindulgence that not even I can stomache. After everything had been spelled out and explained it had to get repeated ad nauseum. I only hope that some day someone can write a sequel in which all the characters get on a big boat and sink into shark infested waters"
3,Mixed Up,"Perhaps, without the graphic description of homo-eroticism Genet has indulged in, this novel would have been impressive as a tale of pure evil.On the top of it all is Querelle's way of expiation or cleansing for murdering Vic who helped him to avoid seizure of the jewels he had stolen. Querelle's expiation or way of being 'reborn'was to seek sodomization voluntarily!!Genet was himself a homosexual , a catamite in early stages. He could write only on the basis of his own experience. And his writing so candidly about homo-sexual experiences might be one of the elements for his fame as a member of the literati.Guillame Apollinaire rapturously described the pearly rotundities of a woman's behind.Genet's Querelle is the literature of man's nether parts!"
4,A lot of fun!,"I enjoyed this book quite a bit - Jerusha Bailey was a very funny character and this book had several laugh-out-loud-funny parts. All in all, it made for an amusing read and I'm glad it had a good, satisfying ending! There are definitely some scenes that will stick with me for a long time. Though brief, it's a surprisingly powerful novel. Friedman has a real talent!"
4,The most I've laughed out loud in years,"I don't know why there are so few reviews for this novel; I'm assuming that they all must have been erased? At any rate, I was so glad to have stumbled upon the paperback edition of this tender, gutsy, and above all hilarious hit. The protagonist Jerusha offers so many layers of character development, and her constant bigotted proclamations cling to just enough plausibility that you can't help but enjoy her superstitious downward social comparison. What a wonderful outlet for all of life's affronts it would be to have every downtrodden class, race, and religion as your fall guy.Friedman's editors have done a fabulous job of keeping the pace tight, often skipping unnecessary redundancies between the three narrating characters. A coming-of-age novel for the perpetual middle-aged adolescent, we could all use this little reminder of core ethics, self-determinism, and personal growth."
5,"If you loved Confederacy of Dunces, you will love this book","Secondhand Smoke is funny and poignant and real. How an author can capture in perfect pitch the voices of three characters is beyond belief. But, the best part of the book is that it is funny while capturing the pain of just trying to get by in a disfunctional family in a disfunctional world. The reviewers who compare Patty Friedmann's work to Confederacy of Dunces are dead on right. This book is a must read."
1,"ordered a new copy, got a used copy","We ordered a new copy of this book, paid $44.50 plus shipping. The book we received was used: inside, there was extensive underlining with a black pen. The book we received should have been sold as a used book."
5,Hundreds of ideas,"I recommend this book to many teachers in K-12 classrooms and use it a lot in my own work as an advocate. This book is filled with hundreds of ideas and most of them are appropriate for students with any need, ability, or challenge including those with cognitive disabilities, learning disabilities, autism, and physical disabilities."
5,IT WORKS GREAT,"It really works out with a few drops and the room smell really well, very easy to use."
3,"not bad, not great","As an alternative cellist myself, I was hoping to really like this band. They're OK, but don't quite hit me at the center of myself. The music is thickly layered and very well recorded. The drumming is compentant, as well as the songwriting. I wouldn't call the playing stunning, or the singing. Rasputina plays to a heavy-goth crowd, and for me shows the interest in costume and pose that that crowd goes for. They also show themselves as having the LA style."
2,Some Songs Are Listenable Some are Trite,"Kate Moss? That gawddamn rollerskate song? Oh, no. The spoken tracks are equally repelling. There is really no atmosphere to this album."
5,Cello Rock! I'm even working on a fan site...,"My first experience with Rasputina was working in a record store. They let me take home the promo cause nobody wanted it. This was the second album ""How We Quit The Forest"". I was blown away. Mellora is so funny and talented. Her sining style takes a few tries to get used to, but is worth the patience.So anyway, after listing to the second one, and then getting the new one ""Cabin Fever"", I thought, ""oh the first one will probably be under produced and less mature"". How silly I've been... I can't decide which one I like most!Get this album, and if you don't have the other two, get those as well! (I think i'm going to go buy their remix EP ""Transylvanian Regurgitation"" now, just to be a fanatical collector!) I'm even thinking about building a Flash fan site..."
4,Beautiful,"I love this cd... and I've listened to it at least twice a day since I first got it awhile ago. Some of the songs are historical, but more like short tales than school book text, and the violins and cello's help paint an even more vivid picture. Just imagine being with Luis when he ""wrote"" ""Interview with the Vampire"": violins, dark-lit rooms, dolls..."
3,I really tried to like this one,"I'm always looking for music that breaks old habits (e.g. guitar based arrangements) and creates new form. The cello arrangements on this CD are a great idea, but the writing and the singing just aren't very good -- half-baked sophmoric lyrics, wimpy dramatic vocals. Reheated Kate Bush. Apparently some people are really moved and excited by this music, I'm not one of them. sorry"
3,Good Music & Vocals,"May this band never bring themselves down by (EVER again) playing with bands whose wimpy female singers ruin the awesome, 'nother world vibe one gets from Rasputina. They're a league of their own, and deserve respect, not to be held back by playing with bands that most people find annoying!"
4,Quirkily amusing,"I'm all for pop that reaches out and incorporates elements of classical music. This band of three women cellists has made something quite different here.They definitely have the whole breeches-and-stockings neo-romantic thing going here, though songs like ""Transylvania Concubine,"" with its amusingly cheesy lyric, might strike some as trying just a little too hard. But covering Melanie's ""Brand New Key"" is unexpectedly pleasant.It's the strange accompanied recitatives on this record that strike me as the most interesting thing here. ""The Donner Party"" is a lovely parody of ""transgressive"" academic bunkum. There are other monologues here that are almost equally as strange."
4,just had,to have it because its better having two than one in my tool box. i love it and i will continue to use it.
3,Optimism Factor,"This book assumes one places blame for one's problems on God, and uses this premise as the springboard for its discussion. Since I don't agree with the original premise, I didn't gain much from the book."
4,4.5 Stars,"You want hard house? You got it.DJ Irene's ""Global House Diva"" explodes out of the jewel case with its infectious tracks and bass-thumping, block-rockin' beats. It's a good mix of varying beats (but hard house all the way), spoken quips, and even the occasional bit of humour. It even includes a Tetris track, and who doesn't love one of those?It doesn't get 5 stars becasue, as another reviewer mentioned, the track lengths could be a little longer. But it's cool to play to someone who hasn't heard it before and you look all cool and whatnot because you know exactly where the breaks are.This one is much better than Global House Diva 2."
5,What a dream!,"I read this book thinking I was not going to like it, that it would be too ""horsey"". I was so wrong! I was hooked from the first page and the following pages only made me want to read faster. What a delightful and sweet story. I could see all the characters so clearly in my mind and could even smell the horse sweat. Pretty good since I never smelled horse sweat before. I really enjoyed the adventures of Lindy and her family and hope there is a sequel in the works."
1,What Gives?,"There I was looking for the *Original* version of ""It's a Heartache"" & not only is it nowhere to be found, but when I *Do* finally see the title, it's this crappy remake of it.So it's no longer available at all, huh? Geez..."
4,A must-have for any CD collection,"While Terra isn't Whitley's strongest work (see his Living With the Law or Dirt Floor for unparalleled, 5-star albums) that's like saying Michael Jordan had a mediocre game because he scored 40 points instead of 45. Tracks such as Weightless, Immortal Blues, Cool Wooden Crosses, Gasket and Aerial make this CD worth far, far more than the $$ you'll spend for it. Anything this guy does is worth owning; he's the most underrated artist out there. His talent for songwriting and guitar-playing goes unsurpassed."
2,I adore CW's music beyond all reason--,"actually, I also adore CW himself beyond all reason. But this CD is terrible. I mean, it's really bad. With the exception of the spooky and powerful Clear Blue Sky and the funky and original Aerial, these songs range from the unlistenable to the merely OK. My life is no different for having heard Cool Wooden Crosses (unlike the case with, say, Dust Radio or Frontier or Scrapyard Lullaby) while Still Point is just monotonous.As to the one song everyone seems to like: Automatic has some wonderfully intense and vivid lyrics but the music is so bone-chillingly radio-oriented that it's one of the most off-putting songs I've ever heard by any artist. Nothing wrong with radio-friendly tunes--they help sell CDs and keep artists afloat. But Automatic's music is pop-ish in a hostile way. Maybe a way to give the finger to a record company that wanted, like so many fans, just a rehash of Living with the Law? Maybe that's what this whole CD is about. Just a guess."
4,As advertised and arrived quickly,"Love ordering from Amazon. Be very careful though to make sure that anything you order for your car is the right fit as it seems easy to select a part, in this case a filter, that would be a different vehicle's fit."
5,Area covered by this book,"Great book as everyone else said. It covers areas west of a line from Houston to mid-North Dakota. From the US - Canada line to San Antonio, TX in the south. The author states that in south Texas ""there will be an increasing number of species that are not treated in this book."""
4,Good unit,"Does the job well, so far. It fits the valve stem well and works as expected. Can't comment yet on long term use."
5,Very well-built air chuck,"I've gone through a few cheap air chucks, with the last one being from Home Depot. It was cheap (a couple of bucks) but it lasted only about a year before cracking at the base. So, I thought I'd step up to a Milton since I've heard nothing but good things about their products.Very glad that I did. Just taking it out of the package I could tell that it was built far better than the cheap ones at the big box stores. Very hefty build quality. It also works very well - the head angle makes it easy to reach tire valve stems without putting stress on my aging knees. Much easier to use than the ball-type chucks. It has female 1/4 inch threads at the base.It's a little more expensive than a cheap Chinese-made chuck, but well worth the cost. This will probably outlive me! Highly recommend."
1,My great grandmother would have loved this one!,"This book is AWFUL. The designs are dull, very old fashioned and out of date. It is a complete waste of money if you are younger than 95 years old. If you are looking for a fantastic book on this subject look at ""The Rug Hook Book"" by Thom Boswell, it covers it all from where to get supplies, choosing fabrics (with lots of ideas for adding fun and unusual materials for texture and color), great patterns from traditional to modern. I just can't say enough. If you only buy one book.....this should be the one!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
3,So far so good.,"Haven't really used it too much. But everything seems to work fine on it. The job I did on car was already done with one I bought at auto store. Barely used, saw price of this one online and was more than half the price of one at auto store, so decided to return first one and get this one. Will need for many other tight-spaced, 10mm bolt head jobs. Great for the cash, let's see how it works!"
2,Very Depressing,"This book, Indio, is depressing beyond reason. I will not tell you the story, but what I can tell you is that it is the most depressing book I've ever read. There are many deaths in this story. I like tearjerkers, but this one is too much for me."
5,Wonderful. Bassalicious.,"If this CD doesn't out do all of them, I don't know what does. It's straight mixing for the truest bass fan. Most creative and not straightforward look 'at me bass. It varies it up and it's most def."
3,worth the money,Some good tracks on the CD to help get a party crunk. Will take you back to the days.
1,Waste of time and money.,"I bought the 6.0 upgrade without reading the reviews. Woe to the foolish. It slowed WORD to a crawl, brought DtSearch to it's knees, and twice locked my system up so tightly I couldn't get the task manager open.I didn't waste any additional time seeing how slow it was at its own tasks. I'll take everyone's word for it.Less than one day on the machine. I've gone back to 5.0."
3,Very mixed feelings...,"I use PDFs a lot and I must say that quite often I turn to Free PDF software to actually do the tasks that Acrobat fails to do. One area I have always had a problem with is the formatting of some documents in size and sometimes Acrobat simply fails to recognize them and so I switch to the Free PDF software which has no problems doing this and is easier to use.However if you are a pro PDF maker who wants to add sigs and links and notes and chapters and all the other function tags including security tags then I recommend this product hands down as the best one. I just find that it is not always the best PDF software package in the world, but a good one all the same.I would not recommend buying this one just to make standard PDF files alone. If you want to touch up those file then this is what you need to do that right."
3,Basic PDF functions,"I bought this program for my home computer. It is the oldest version of Acrobat that can be used as a basis to upgrade to the newest version. There are many free or inexpensive programs that create PDFs. If you want to combine multiple PDFs into a single document, you need the real Adobe Acrobat program. Acrobat 6.0 Standard handles basic PDF handling functions. It doesn't have some of the newer features, but it does the basics almost as well as the newest program. At some point I plan to upgrade, but Acrobat 6.0 is a good starting program."
3,This product and its updates must be installed in order,"I bought Adobe Acrobat 6.0 more than a year ago because someone told me that 7.0 had some glitches to watch out for. I have had to reload the 6.0 software at least 15 times because it hangs up or just stops working. I searched for answers online and finally learned that the problem comes from the updates not being installed correctly. You cannot have updates on the computer that are a later version than the software. I took off all versions of updates for both reader and acrobat and installed just 6.0. Then, I installed the updates and the latest version of Adobe Reader. I haven't had to reload the software since. Hope this helps someone resolve their issues with this product."
5,Adober Acrobat 6.0 Standard,"I have used this personally so purchased it for the office. (Someone in the office had purchased the 7.0 Professional Upgrade--but I had nothing to upgrade. By the time I got around to purchasing Standard, I could not find either 6.0 or 7.0 Standard anywhere, except at Amazon.com.) Upon receipt, it was exactly what I had purchased and the price could not be beat."
5,"Good price, lots of tools","Forget any other PDF maker; Adobe is the best. Acrobat 6 allows you to insert, delete, and rotate pages, as well as create a PDF from just about anything simply by pressing the Print key and selecting PDF. While this doesn't have all the bells and whistles, it's better than what you get with most scanners. Thanks for sending it so promptly."
3,Adobe Acrobat 6.0 Oldy,"I ordered this product for several reasons. First because I do not want to pay the high prices of Adobe software in latest versions; second because my wife is really customed with it and she prefer no changes in this matters; and third, because I needed to restore my computer. I guess everybody using Acrobat knows its capabilities and limitations."
4,Rare recording of Tsar's Coronation,"People who are interested in the Romanov dynasty will want to get a copy of his historic recording of Sibelius' Cantata for the coronation of Nicholas II. The sound is great and the performance is brisk and even a bit pushy at times. The notes that came with the recording say that this piece has never been performed since it was first given in 1896. It's an interesting piece and I am glad I bought the CD. The other selections on the CD are fun to listen to, charming, fresh and uplifting. I felt like running through a grassy meadow after listening to this CD! The performance of Finlandia seems to have been thrown in to help sales of the other selections on this CD which are all rare. Its' a good rendition."
5,"An invaluable, unique source of reference!!!","This book, the result of extensive research and experience, brings together some five hundred individual stitches used in embroidery throughout the centuries. Each example has been worked by the author and photographed to the same scale, illustrating the complete stitch. Additional diagrams explain, step by step, the method of working the stitch. Most highly recommended!!"
1,Snips unAmerican,"Purchased for husband and son who are sheet metal benchmen. Husband has used Irwin in the past but these are not as well made, not as large nor are they even AMERICAN made! What a disappointment. Returned and did not receive full refund."
2,Outdated when it comes to attraction closings,"Many of the main attractions in St. Petersburgh and Moscow are museums and the like.Museums in both cities tend to be closed at least one day during the week. It is different days for different museums.There were a significant amount of attractions (probably about 1/3) in both cities where the book had incorrect days. So we'd show up on a day it was supposed to be open, and they were closed. Or the hours were wrong. Or the book would say that they had english tours and they did not.I was extremely disappointed at such a major oversight."
1,Non-Existent Restaurants,"The reason we got the newest edition of this book was so that we can look up restaurants and clubs to visit, and three times, we used the reviews in this guidebook to eat in one of the recommended places. One such place was in Moscow - we found the exact address, but it was a travel agency and there were no signs of that place ever being a restaurant. The other two places were in St. Petersburg, one was even a starred review. We did find one place, ""beer exchange"", but it was such a sad place that the blurb about it in this book was more like a deceptive ad than an unbiased review. We finally stopped trying, so who knows how many more places recommended in this guidebook aren't really there.Also, the street names in the book are all in english only, but the street names in Russia are mostly in Cyrillic."
5,Great bathroom reading,"I'm primarily a Reds fan but enjoy reading about anything baseball-related, especially if you get to know players are on a much deeper basis. In fact, it's often the non-superstars that I found most interesting.This book fit this description personally. Forsch, like other subjects in the ""Tales from the Dugout"" series, was a local favorite but not really known on a national scale. However, his stories include all of the big names in Cardinals history, so you get to read new stories as well as the famous ones (however, you get to hear them from a new perspective).A storied called GQ Joe (Joe Magrane) alone was worth the price of the book."
3,MI video review,"The video was formatted as that of a lecture. I am a Teacher Education major and I learned of Howard Gardner and his theory of Multiple Intelligences in an Interdisciplinary course. The class I took in college was more in depth and interesting, showing how to implement his theories in the classroom. The video is an overview of his book, Frames of Mind, and reinforces what I learned in my college class."
1,Disappointed,"This tea set is extremely small. The pictures displayed are deceptive and not true to size. The actual saucers can fit in the palm of your hand in case anyone wants the true size. Instead of a tea-set for a child, it's like a tea set for a child's doll. Considering returning. Hope this was helpful. :o)"
1,CONTAINS LEAD WARNING!,"I just wanted to write and tell people that I just saw this online at target and (why they are still selling it I dont know) but the put a warning under the description in all caps that reads: Illinois Lead Poisoning Prevention Act, 410 ILCS 45/6(a), WARNING: MAY CONTAIN LEAD. MAY BE HARMFUL IF EATEN OR CHEWED. MAY GENERATE DUST CONTAINING LEAD.I decided not to buy it after I read that cause more than likely while pretending, a child is going to want to touch their mouth to this!"
2,SMALLLLL,This set looks so pretty on the website and despite all the reviews about it being too small I still purchased it. HUGE MISTAKE! The teacups are smaller than a shot glass. Wayyyy too small. The set would be sufficient for a doll not 8 year olds. Disappointed....
4,Great for my 4 and 2 year olds.,"For the price, the set is good quality. We have had no breakages even though our toddler has carried it about. My one and only complaint is that the teapot dribbles when pouring. (I expect to clean a mess anyway with a 4 and 2 year old, but it is a bit frustrating for them.)"
5,A MUST for all sky watchers!!,"The previous reviews tell it all! Terence Dickinson brings a highly scientific area filled with map's, coordinate's, special equipment (lenses, types of telescopes, ect.), just about any question you could ask about astronomy and put's it into a language anybody can understand!! An excelent astronomer and writer! Check out all book's affiliated with Terence!!"
5,Dispense with technical mind boggling!,This is the first book I've read explaining the universe that keeps it simple enough for a beginner to understand. I checked the book out at the public library and can not wait to get my own copy and a highlighter. Fantastic!
5,"perfect mix of industrial, metal, and techno","This album is nothing but amazing. Unfortunately it's almost impossible to get in the US, until now. August 13, 2002 this absolutely amazing album is coming out here, in the states. Every track on this CD is great. The vocals, lyrics, programming, guitars, everything is top notch. The songs are intelligent and catchy. They mix together the guitars and vocals of a metal band, the programming of techno, and the look and feel of gothic industrial. Nothing could be more perfect."
5,standout in an underdeveloped genre,"I have to say that Zeromancer, despite their relatively low profile, Zeromancer's music is instantly catch and engaging. I would compare them to Rammstein with maybe double the synthwork - Eurotrash is a perfect synthesis of hard rock and techno, and there's very little out there comparable to it. Heartily recommended."
4,I sawem live for this tour,"I went to a Pigface / Thrill kill kult concert and Zeromancer was one of the openers. I thought just another opener till they started to play. They impressed me soo much I became a fan instantly and have been following their progress and recomending them ever since. Send me an angel, was an amazing cover, it took me back in time to the movie Teen Wolf 2. Need you like a drug and Dr. Online are the other great songs on this album. They both just pop into my head randomly. A permanent addition to my playlist."
4,Tougher than the rest - better than the originals,"Ostbahn Kurti is one of the leading singers in Austria. He's not famous for his songwriting, but for his singing style and his life style. He's a ""savage dog"", as we say in Bavaria. Kurti and his band, Die Chefpartie, doing mostly cover versions. But the thing is: They do it with their own lyrics, written by the band and in their own vienna slang. This slang is understood very well in Austria, in the most parts of Bavaria - but that's it. So he'll never get the chance to be a real rockstar in Germany. On this album he's doing great versions of Thin Lizzy, Paul Young and John Prine. The Album includes some great Rock'n'Roll (play it loud!), fine Rhythm'n'Blues, a little Country, a little Soul and is played by a band, which obviously had a lot of fun with recording this album. This fun you can hear, and this is why this album is something special."
3,ambitious is way under rated,i bought this albumn just to get a digital copy of the song Ambitious. what a great effort with some very creative guitar playing.
2,a stepdown for jeff beck,"Flash is a commercial and overly slick rendering of a great artist. Much of the material here sounds as though it were recorded by someone other than Jeff Beck.This record was released to make Jeff Beck palatable for the top 40 listining, dumb teeny boppers who follow trends only. A long time Jeff beck fan and true rock music afficianado will find this lame release to be a waste of a talented artist. Try Blow by Blow, Wired, Beck Bogart and appice and beckology if you want to hear the real jeff beck"
3,Not his best but still ...,"This is the least satisfying release from the catalog of rock's greatest guitarist. But you get a lot of great solos here, and the fantastic version of ""People Get Ready"" with Rod Stewart on vocals (it's too bad they didn't do the entire album together). A 3 star Jeff Beck album is still better than a lot of others. He has set the bar so high for himself!"
3,Jeff and Nile are like oil and water - a rare career mistake,This is unlistenable. Thank god this is Jeff's only time in his career he went for the dollars instead of the substeance. This sounds like a poor mans Chic and thats not good.
2,Jeff Beck + Synth-rock = Disaster,"This is a by far Beck's worst album. Made in the mid-80's this music is combined with too much synthesizers and not enough of Beck's guitar.The vocals range from sub-par to poor.I gave it two stars for the tracks ""People Get Ready"" with Rod Stewart on vocals and the other ""Ambitious"" the only two tracks that actually show off Beck's trademark licks.Pass on this cd."
3,Gregory Bardakos,"Only ""1"" great song from this set. I will give you a clue as to which one.No Vocals.G"
2,Jeff Beck Flash,This album is my least favorite from Jeff Beck. I bought the album when it first came out. I played it maybe 5 times and stashed it away in my lp storage area. I did not even record it to cassette. It is still in great shape. I liked the guitar but the extra chessy vocals killed me. People Get Ready is the best song by far on it. There was a music video of it that made the rounds on MTV back in the day. You can buy the song on Best of Jeff Beck Cd and get it on there with a lot of other good Jeff Beck. Maybe some day I will bring it out again and see if it was as bad as I remember. Now saying that. This not so good Jeff beck LP is better than most any thing else out now days.
1,beck's abortion,"jeff's absolute worst, bar none. even the awful live with jan hammer set has a tune or two worth hearing, but this has nothing. ok, here and there you have a ten-second guitar solo worth listening to, but there isn't one whole song that's any good, and most have an irritating disco-style production. beck even sings on one, and his voice may accurately be described as an english accent, period. stay away from this and get blow by blow or guitar shop instead."
4,Jeff's Stab at Commercial Success,"I actually like this album. It ranks low on the totem pole of JB releases, but it'snot a bad listen. Nile Rogers' production style is all over it, which is a minus.He was a pretty hot producer at the time. Just think of it as a brief departure and enjoy itfor what it is/was. It's got some excellent guitar work and should be in any Beck fanscollection. BBA was worse in my opinion."
2,'80s production techinques at it's worst.,"The song ""People Get Ready"", the solo at the end of ""Ambitious"", ""Escape"" and ""Get workin'"" are the only ones that worked for me and even these sound extremely dated today. This CD has that wretched '80s overproduced sound, with drum machines and synthesizers practically ruining everything. Beck's guitar has to fight to stay above the din and succeeds only a few times. Just about anything else in his solo catalogue is better than this."
1,Don't Ask? Don't Bother!,"Tina Arena was hailed as Australia's answer to Celine Dion because of her apparent glorious singing voice. Maybe I'm missing something here, but this girl has one of the most dreadful voices I've ever heard. Yes, she can belt out a number and yell her heart out, but her singing is dull and, in a lot of cases, extremely flat. The song-writing is very weak (the only good number is her only hit, Chains), re-using the same rhyming and same structure for almost every song, and the songs themselves would be filler material on another artists' album. Her fans are all surprised that she never became as successful as Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston -- here's the reason: Mariah and Whitney have wonderful singing voices. Tina hasn't. Anyone can belt out a song, but most singers would belt it out in tune."
5,Fantastic,"I enjoyed the CD. I particularly liked the lyrics and melody to ""Show Me Heaven""! I would think that a sample of this song should be attached to the website so all can hear the beauty of the song!"
4,a mellow disc,"This c.d is something of an aquired taste.It is,however,a good disc to dance and sing to whether you are at home or listening to it in your car.There were a few songs I didn't care for,but no one is perfect all the time."
1,Tina Arena SUCKS!,Overrated singer with the plain voice. Give me another -- any other -- singer's album!
5,Williams takes one of everything,"Being a long time fan of Walter Jon Williams, I was naturally delighted with Aristoi. Like many authors, there were many ideas that he borrowed from his previous works. But also there were plenty of new and refreshing ideas.I would say Aristoi is either a book a person reads before reading any other novel by Williams, or after they have read through his works. The ideas in it are covered in virtually every other book he has written, save each individual novel covers only one or two aspecs of Aristoi.What sets Aristoi aside as one of the best modern S/F novels written was the intriguing writing style of Williams. In the novel, people have controlled split personalities (who are beholden to the prime). Williams splits the page in half and while on one side the story progresses, the other side has the commentaries of the personailities. Unique to say the least.I can not recommend this book any higher. Buy it, borrow it or steal it.:"
5,I WANT A SEQUEL,"This is one of the few science fiction books where I have actually wished for a sequel upon finishing. Aristoi is a complete book, but there's still so much left to figure out -- I would really like to see what happens next.One of the things I really like about the book was the realistic-ness of the science. While Aristoi definitely isn't ""hard"" science fiction,a lot of it is based on actual science and psychology."
4,"molto buono, ottima ""contaminatio""","ebbene sì, un contributo anche in italiano (lingua abbandonata sulla rete)il romanzo é un eccellente esempio di come sia ancora possibile ottenere una contaminazione di generi di assoluto risultato (esotismo, un pizzico di esoterismo, la cultura orientale, il romanzo si science fiction tradizionale etc.) : anche la cura e l'attenzione per la scrittura, non meno che per il ""plot"", sono estremamente positivi; la leggerezza del tono e del ""suono"" riesce a bilanciare la crescita della storia; verso la fine il libro soffre un po', e perde la concentrawione e l'ispirazione delle prime parti.Comunque, un interessante esperimento e un buon romanzo"
3,not as good as everyone says it is,"I had heard such good reviews about this book. I just couldn't get into it. I found Gabriel and the other Aristoi to be boring, egotistical, and were not characters that I could care about. The premise of the book was interesting, but it was not carried out well."
5,Milton S446 2 In 1 Valve Tool,"great for deflating tires with tpms where schrader valve won't budge, screw it on let tire deflate no worrying about breaking valve, tool is really small, my recommendation screw it on an rubber tire valve for storage"
4,great sized bag! and cute!,"I recently bought the adidas duffle bag in collegiate light blue. It is a wonderfully designed bag perfect for sleepovers, meets, games, camp, and more! There are lots of pockets in conveinant places, and a great size! I would recommend this bag to anyone, and I enjoy it very much!"
3,gym bag,Bag arrived with rips and tears in the top and side. It has been returned with the expectation of a full refund credited to our account.
5,Adidas Elite Medium Duffle Team Orange,"I ordered this for my granddaughter for xmas , orange is her school color. Very nice bag and the shipping time was great. I would order again . Max"
4,Adidas Bag,"its a good bag, light and spacious. I like it. The only thing that stoped me from giving a 5 star rating is the straps have plastic clips at the end to connect to bag, i would rather like good quality metal ones. Also shipping should be as high as it is.adidas Elite Medium Duffel"
3,They cut the songs short,I am a new Sly stone fan and this is the first album I bought. I was very dissappointed because the songs I wanted (Rock Dirge and Buttermilk and other similiar ones) were CUT SHORT!!!! Seems the producers decided to fade out the songs after 3 or 4 minutes. WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!!
2,Don't get excited,"This collection has been repackaged and retitled so many times it's scary. It's all early stuff, mostly done in a doo-wop style. Most run of the mill SFS fans wouldn't be interested, as it lacks the rythmic power and funk of the later recordings. That said, if you're a die-hard fan. it's very interesting in an historical context."
5,A definite club hit,"Down here in San Diego, Silver Ray is a club hit at the industrial clubs. The Guardian Angel is the best mix. Check out their sister band...Fictional."
4,Torch,I read this book when i was about 17. It was given to me by Pat when he worked at the Clark station in Coldwater. It was shortly after his release from military camp (I think thats where he was). I had two copies and lent them both out but never got them back.......The story line is good and I was pulled into the book I think mostly because i have lived in the area my whole life. The book is very graphic and disturbing at times just because of some of the detail with the writer being the main character and wondering if it was actually a auto biography :). Over all it was a good book and I would recommend it only to mature readers.
3,funny dance-metal,"In ""Hellraver"", the german band Think About Mutation mixes rough metal and dance-music (the meeting of two opposite kinds of music). A records for ""Industrial Freaks""."
3,porta-crib mattress,"I just bought this porta-crib mattress. It is adequate in terms of quality. I've bought other porta-crib mattresses in the past that were much nicer. This mattress wasn't wrapped and when I cut the box open, I also cut the mattress. So beware if you buy one."
1,Disappointed,"This is not a standard size for a portable crib matteress. It is much smaller. I need to fill the gap with a sheet, towel or something."
3,"Different Than Pictured, Still Nice","This Sake carafe is not the short, squat one with a cord wrapped around the neck that first came up when I ordered it, but rather the taller, thinner design without the cord that is now showing up in the product picture. That being said, the set that we did receive is well worth what we paid.The carafe and cups are good looking with a very nice glaze finish. The storage box is just OK quality, but serves it's purpose. I can't recommend this since it isn't clear which set you will receive.CFH"
2,"UP THE IRONS, BUT DOWN WITH Di'Anno!","I REMEMBER WATCHING IRON MAIDEN'S FIRST TOUR OF AMERICA AND THINKING, ""THIS GROUP IS GOOD, BUT THE SINGER SUCKS."" Less than a year later, DiAnno was gone and Dickinson was in. Di'Anno didn't and still doesn't have any vocal range. He sounds like someone who's trying to use the bathroom, but is constipated. These versions of Iron Maiden songs are far inferior to the ones re-done by Bruce Dickinson. If you like the way Rob Halford sings and Bruce Dickinson and Ronnie James Dio, Robert Plant, Geoff Tate, then you'll hate this CD. If you want truly great metal, look elsewhere. This is similar to bad garage band stuff sung by a drunk 9th grader."
5,"Paul Dianno Live, The Man Live, The Beast Live!","This CD shows to the world a new concept of what the word power means! Excelent smashing, powerful and energy loaded songs. The best of Iron Maiden's absolute classics. The diference between the songs of this album and the original maiden classics lies in Paul's awesome performance.In his fantastic screams, it seems like if he wanted to be heared by the whole world. The song 'Women in Uniform' is the first live recording of this Maiden classic!!If you enjoy Iron Maiden classics or the work of Paul Di'anno you simply must have this CD!"
3,Highway to Heaven?,"I bought the book because I was intrigued by the reviews.After reading it I have mixed feelings about the spiritual attainmentof the women portrayed in the book. Only one woman(Ruth) out of six seemed to me to be close to the sacred.Several of the women appeared disturbed, rather thanenlightened. Read the book and decide for yourself."
1,broken,"it did, in fact, crumble in my hand an hour after I put it on. I remember wondering during just which part of my morning commute had I been nailing deck screws in with my hands or something to have achieved this incredibly unfortunate result. Upon inspection when I picked up the pieces from the floor of my car where I'd dropped them in disgust, I realized how intensely porous and fragile the stone was... maybe this ring should come with a disclaimer: wear gloves so that touching a steering wheel or a cup of coffee during a drive doesn't shatter it lol"
4,Rhodinite Ring,I like the ring a lot but the sizing chart was off. When I placed my present ring on the chart it showed a size 10. When I got the ring it fit my first finger instead of my third.
4,First-person accounts of the action and human perspective.,"I just finished reading this book, and wanted to order it for my son. It provides a perspective from many places and people often overlooked. It presents vividly the statements and recorded conversations of top German, American and British leaders. It also provides perspective from Italians, Poles, Czechs, Danes and Hungarians. However, it is very weak on Russian, Swiss and French views. Perhaps now that Russian archives from the Soviet era have opened an historian will write a book that will fill that gap. The illustrations and maps are helpful, but all too few.The savagery of that era comes through all too well. To read this book is a reminder to pray that it will never happen again."
2,A disappointing book,"I thought it was a biography of Cecilia Bartoli, but it is not. This book mairly gives Chernin's impression of Bartoli's career and life. So, don't expect too much."
1,Dreadful,"This book could have been much better had the writers been not so blinded by Ms. Bartoli's voice. There are a few serious flaws with this title, the first being that Ms. Bartoli was too young to be the subject of a biography. She simply hasn't sung enough yet, nor has she hit her prime. These ladies fawn so much on her voice that I couldn't continue reading. Please, I know it's beautiful but get passed it! It further offers no critical insight and remains quite superficial. I wonder what Ms. Bartoli's take on this project was? Although an ardant fan of the lady, those looking for an exploration into the world of opera and what Ms. Bartoli hopes to achieve, will be sadly disappointed."
3,wow,this product was an amazing product! I would definitely recommend this product to everyone!I used when i went hiking and it was perfect for my needs until it broke and fell apart!
5,Pink Swiss Army..Go Figure,My wife lost her last Swiss Army to those guys at TSA...Yea you just know that somebody's kid has that in his pocket. So I got her another and can you believe it a pink one at that..Perfect...
2,Disappointing,"The game timer did not work. Thinking the batteries were old, I bought new ones and it still wouldn't work. Was very disappointed."
4,fun and quick game,"This game was shipped promptly and was everything that it said it was. Seems to be very durable. The 8 year old grandson is able to play along with adults, which was my purpose. Would recommend."
3,ok,"the game is ok, but the kind of annoying we don't really get much use out of it. but someone might like it."
4,fun little game,easy to learn and fun. The only problem is that many of the answers are too easy. I would recommend this game.
4,It's ok but a little harder for kids,"Our adult friends love this game. Our children, however, do not know a lot of the answers. Very small and compact. You can carry it anywhere with you."
2,Nothing special trivia cards,"The answers to these trivia questions are way too easy.The sound effects are a bit annoying.After you play it once, you probably won't ever pull it out again because it only comes with so many cards. You may just as well use a trivia app on your smart phone and read the questions aloud."
5,Lots of fun,"I got this game as a Christmas gift for my family, and we all really enjoyed playing it. The questions are good for any age, my parents and my 13-year old brother could both answer the questions. It is also fun to just quiz each other with the cards without keeping score-a great way to pass the time."
5,So Much Fun!,"My family and I are always looking for a great game to play and this was perfect. Large and small groups can play, and many different ages can play as well. My grandma loves this game and so does my eleven year old sister. And while you play you learn great trivia, and laugh along with your family and friends.The only problem is that the tongue buzzer goes off at the slightest touch. When we brought it on a road trip (since it is very easy to bring, with its compact size- all the cards fit into it) every bump the car hit made the buzzer go off. But it was funny, not very obnoxious at all."
3,Tip of the Tongue,"The game is not a great game for teens. Some of the subject questions are going back to the 80's. Some questions are really hard even for adults. You do learn in the process, but not that much fun."
4,Game,Great game but I do not recommend it for use with special education students. Many of the descriptions are for college age & up.
3,It's only so-so,"Mostly useless trivia, more easy than hard questions. Some questions are ""dated"", usually only age 35+ would know answers. The main challenge is not spitting out the answer within the 2-seconds allowed. The case that the cards somes in is not very durable. The spring-loaded card case does not hold all of the cards at the same time, and the springs come loose or unattached, causing malfunction of the case."
3,"Fun at first, but quickly ""meh""","It's fun and briefly addictive for some, though the game will not engross most players. Even though you only have two seconds to answer the question you'll find the questions so incredibly easy you're answering them before the question is done before the timer is even activated. They're very simple general knowledge questions, and that is the whole idea behind the game, which does give it a unique experience. Overall, though, it's a bit bland of a game after the initial kick you get out of it."
4,Student Review,"Civil Engineering Materials,by Shan Somayaji, is an excellent tool for learning the fundamentals of materials used for civil engineering. The book consists of Theoretical material with examples and graphs that reinforce the concepts covered. The key equations are set in bold, similar to other engineering text books. Unlike other engineering texts, this book does not confuse the reader. This is acomplished by providing only the material relevent to the current section. The material included consists of materials from aggregates to concrete to lumber and its grading. I used this book to help me complete a intoductory to engineering materials course. I would reccomend this book to people who have completed a strength of materials course and are interested in gaining knowledge of the most common materials used in the civil engineering profession."
2,Not so interesting...,"This book started off promising but quickly became an exercise in warmed-over characters, plotting, and dialogue. As another reviewer points out, the 50s setting is not carried through the dialogue, which indeed sounded far too 90s. Several of the character's ruminations about 50's B-movies and horror sounded so close to other sources (most notably Stephen King's own thoughts on the topic in his nonfictional Danse Macabre) that I almost expected to see an acknowledgment page at the end. My biggest complaint, however, is the way in which chapters ended with a 'surprise.' Often, what would have been a more interesting scene in terms of character responses is left for some new scene, stifling the material. This stop and start pacing and a heist that takes too long to develop make this book an overall disappointment. The reader's time is far better spent with any of the LA Noir series by James Ellroy."
5,Abstract Jazz Delight,"The sound of this CD is as if music as we know it had ceased to exist, Taylor and Bailey set out to reinvent it, and it doesn't come out quite the way it did the first time. Odd and abstract, surprising and delightful."
1,Did not work straight out of box and was new,We bought this toy for Christmas so it was wrapped and put away for Christmas. My daughter opened it and we put the batteries in it and it did not work. The return window of time had passed and we were stuck with a disappointed child.
3,Fun gift for someone who is not your child,"Clay itself is nice. Paints are nice. The tools are nice. The wheel itself is pure junk. First of all, it takes 4 C batteries. Now if you can imagine how much power you get from 4 c batteries, that is what you get. It is EXTREMELY loud and really can not spin fast enough to work as an actual ""pottery wheel"". Add to that, that it is EXTREMELY messy. My 7 YO could somewhat make a cup with the help of her 20 year old aunt. The mess afterwards took about 1 hour clean up, as my daughter had clay on her hands and it got everywhere.This is a great gift if you never need to actual participate in helping to make something. My 7 YO thought it was the coolest thing when she opened it up . . . so grandma felt good about buying a great gift. Mom and aunt needed to deal with the end result . . . so not so great for us. I am thinking of buying one for my sister in law's kids :)"
2,Looks like a great toy but....,"As many toys do this toy looks like a great idea. But also as many toys once you get it out of the box it's a different story. My eight year old was so excited when she opened this for a gift, but was soon disappointed the clay cracks and breaks no matter how long you let it dry or how long you knead it. It must be a joke that kids are actually supposed to be able to make the vases and bowls pictured with the clay that is provided. And the pottery wheel is so loud when you turn it on my child doesn't even want it on. very disappointed."
2,Not worth buying,As soon as you turn the wheel on and try to touch the clay gently the wheel comes off its track and stops
3,Harder to do than it looks!,It's really hard to make the clay turn out good. I think you have to be an expert potter to make it look at all like the picture on the box.
1,Wheel Doesn't Spin Well,"The wheel used in this toy does not spin fast enough to mold the clay provided. The bowls show on the box were obviously not made with this wheel, my 7 year old daughter ended up playing with the clay and we pitched the wheel."
3,Harder than it looks!,"Good idea, but could have used better execution. This is VERY MESSY, and my daughter got bored quickly with it, as you have to stop often to reposition, etc. Also, once she did get one pot done, dried, and painted, the bottom of it CRUMBLED like dust."
1,my child is now crying because of this toy,"As the other reviewers pointed out, this toy does not work. The wheel stops turning at the slightest pressure. My child is now so frustrated that she is sobbing uncontrollably."
3,Fun but hard for kids,"The age group for this toy is 4+ years. My six year old couldn't do it, and neither could I, except with some effort. I think you need a pottery class before you can play with this toy. It's fun once you get the hang of it, but not for a four year old. It could be very frustrating at times. I would put the age range for the toy at 10+."
4,Even grandmas can enjoy,I bought this item for my grandson who loves Playmobil toys. He was very excited to see the movie and wasn't disappointed with it. I also enjoyed watching. The interactive segments are great.
4,Cute overall- minus the voodoo parts,"Hi!Overall, this is a very cute show for small children. I have ages 6,4 and 2. My kids LOVE playmobiltoys so I thought we'd give this a try, and I do like it. However, I DO NOT like the voodoo daddy part. Can we just have nice shows for children without including aspects of the occult?? This was totally inappropriate. This is why I gave this 4 out of 5 stars."
3,So-so - not as cool as the toys.,"I had higher expectations for this - the age range of children that play with playmobiles will likely not understand some of the jokes or even discussion threads that are scattered throughout the movie.We found the ""choose your adventure"" mode to be annoying.The quality of animation is good, and the entertainment value was had, to a degree, but it's not very high in the rotation."
1,Save your money,"This movie is an insult to a child's intelligence. It belongs in the same plotless category as ""Santa Claus Versus the Martians."" The Pirate episode simply ended, with no explanation as to whether it was a dream or reality. The children kept reminding the pirates that stealing is bad, but they played along with the pirates.The next episode had a fire-breathing dragon that was chasing the children as often happens in a child's nightmare. The road was crumbling behind the children as they ran. My 4-year-old grandson was afraid for them.For plotless fun for small children, buy ""Shaun the Sheep"" or ""Pingu"" DVDs instead. Or buy a box of real Playmobil."
5,Pirates!,My four year old son loves this movie. He has a collection of the Playmobil pirate stuff and he is really into pirates. This movie grabs his attention and doesn't let go.
5,Great DVD,"My son loves this DVD, he is big into pirates and this is one of the only pirate dvd's I could find for his age range (3yrs). This is also interactive so you can use your remote to choose differnt options during play, making the movie different each time."
2,Eh....,"Unfortunately, I'm one of those people who have long since lost their DVD player remote and didn't realize that you need one to ""interact"" with this DVD. I bought it thinking my son would get a kick out of it only to discover that we can't use it yet."
5,Great for toddlers,"My four year old loves playmobil toys so I got the movie for him and he loves it!! It's a cute entertaining, not scary even though it features pirates movie."
1,Faulty DVD,Sadly..I think this DVD would interest my 5 year old but we received a broken copy. The interactive options do not work at all...it always moves forward to the fall-back choice. Also...the DVD sticks or is scratched halfway through the movie. It appeared to be a sealed copy but we obviously received a damaged one.
4,14 kids.......here comes the BSC!!!,"Kristy's mom has been divorced for a while.....not any more!!! Kristy's mom is getting married to Watson Brewer. Here's how it happens: First, Kristy's mom tells her family she's getting married. Everyone is so excited, even Kristy, she's going to be a bridesmaid!! But, then her mom says she mite call off the wedding. They have 14 little kids to watch and a lot to do. But then Kristy gets one of her GREAT IDEAS, what if the BSC could help out? They could watch the kids, and the parents could work. I don't want to spoil the ending but me tell you, Kristy's mom gets married and they have a GREAT wedding."
5,Very happy,Book arrived in a timely manner in excellent condition for a great price! I am very happy with my purchase.
5,Wedding Bells are Ringing!,"Kristy's mom and Watson are getting married!The wedding is going to be much sooner than anyone thought.All of the Thomas/Brewer kids get to be in the wedding.Kristy is going to be the bridesmaid!A lot of relatives are coming and they're bringing their children with them.The Bsc is going to take care of them all.This is a great book.It's really funny, like when Stacey take some kids to the movies.Buy this book!"
2,Proper description lacking,"The product contains one 1/4"" stereo jack to 3.5mm stereo; one 3.5mm to 1/4""; and one 3.5mm stereo to 3.5mm mono.Without any description, I assumed the small one is 2.5mm to 3.5mm. It was mostly my fault, but don't make the same mistake I made."
3,300 year in 150 pages,"Good compresion of history, but will all the limitations of such concentration of events."
2,Incomplete and misleading,"This is not a book on dinnerware - it's a book on pottery; the lowest form of food service next to the paper plate. There is no mention of the great china factories: Lenox, Syracuse or Pickard. The book should be renamed Diner Ware."
3,"""Electronics Batteries"", NOT ""DURACELL Home Medical Batteries"".","Be aware, the product discription denotes the product as ""DURACELL Home Medical Batteries"". However the batteries I recieved were denoted as ""Electronics"". Subtract 2 stars for the faulty description and picture. That said the batteries have a ""Best Befoe"" date of 2021 and seem to work acceptably."
4,Daughter loves it,"I bought this for my daughter who is in middle school orchestra. Not hearing any complaint (a first for my teenagers), I asked her if she liked it, and she nodded -- very high praise indeed!"
5,Perfect for my Kid - Violin Player,"My son was struggling on keeping all his music notes, and papers in order. Other folders / binders he used to have didn't last that much. This is very useful and does its job which is to hold all the papers in place. Good quality, durable and most important, my son liked it!!"
2,Pockets Are Too Narrow for Instrumental Music,"These are heavily padded, thick music folders. I would have preferred a lighter folder, although at least they are protective. The item description designates pockets that hold music that is up to 10.25"" wide. This is rather impossible, as the pockets are under 10"" wide. Orchestra music often runs 10"" wide, and will NOT fit in these folders."
3,Big,"Wow It seems reasonably sized in the picture, but Dang!! It's Huge!!! When ever i open it, the people sitting next to me have to like scootch over! but i am satisfied with my order."
5,Joan's books are the best!,"Great Book full of delicious recipes, that have been tested by the author, I say that because they work. Not always the case with some cookbooks!"
3,1 thumb up 2 thumbs down,"I gave it 3 stars because i got mine from a cigar shop. they usually have cheap guns. this gun ( from the cigar shop) was bad. i went about 15 feet or so before diving down. once i had my 2 friends over and i had only 3 guns, 1 of those was the pistol. i ended up just putting the gun away and tackling my friend ( it worked!). I opened it up to figure the gun was broken. only minor though, all i did was put a peice back in place. It shot about maybe 50 feet then"
3,OK,This is an ok gun...... it is somewhat acurate at 1-30 feet then it curves hard to the right or left. It is a good rescue gun or good for chasing somebody. I wouldnt recomend this for beginers though because the shooter has to take into acount the amount to shoot to the targets sides in order for the bb to curve into it..... i give it 3 stars
4,still climbing.,"""still climbing"" is an apt name for brownstone's follow-up to their smash debut, _from the bottom up_. with new member kina stepping in for mimi, brownstone continues to build upon the solid foundation of their freshman release. and almost direct one-to-one ratio between songs on this album and the last replicate the musical variety that successfully showcases the women's considerable talents. brownstone's lyrics seem infused with an authoritative air that is lacking in those of their girl-group peers. from the get-go, these women have presented themselves as no-nonsense professionals in the style of en vogue and martha & the vandellas. while any of the songs on this album could hold their own against the best of today's crop of female groups, "" 5 miles to empty"", ""kiss and tell"" and ""baby love"" would be first-round TKOs."
4,Still Climbing..........5 Miles To Empty (yes),"These ladies can sing their collective behinds off. Songs such as, In The Game of Love, 5 Miles To Empty, and Baby Love, are good Quiet Storm mood songs. ""If you don't have a clue of what I'm speaking of, get this CD, grab that special person, explore the options""."
5,THE BEST ALBUM EVER,"I love love love brownstone, they where the best. I can never understnad why the best girl groups disband. There voices are heavenly, I listen to this cd all the time. I wish they would come back. Listening to this cd brings back so many memmories. Everyone needs to purchase this, if you like real r&b music and real women who can actually sing you should buy this."
5,Truly Underrated-appreciated Group,"Their first two Albums (this is the 2nd one) should be templates for how sistas should sing and present themselves. I guess they didn't get their just due because they didn't prostitute themselves, they just sang excellent songs and looked like classy women."
4,Still climbing and continuing on this second one,"This 2nd and last album by Brownstone was just as strong as their first one. They still continue the soulful singing on here. And the writing and music are just as strong. There are a lot of midtempo songs and ballads here this time. One of the best songs on here is Revenge, where the woman aggressively goes after the other woman who stole her man. It is so powerfully done, funky song, and dramatic break at the near end where the woman confronts the other woman and chews her up in a calm, but cold manner. I also love 5 Miles to Empty and the soulful closing remake of If You Play Your Cards Right, perhaps a strong swan song for the group. I wished that they'd make more albums after this, but TLC was already hot, En Vogue had their 3rd album ramped out and the other girl groups were in influx back in 1997. A solid followup!"
2,A much weaker album than the first,"The biggest sin is that they traded the sophisticated creative vocal arrangements of the first album, ""From the Bottom Up"" for mundane sometimes even lame arrangements of the 2nd album, ""Still Climbing"". Just listen to the exquisite chorus of ""Don't Cry"" from the 1st album with that whispery soprano obligato underneath. Brilliant! Reminscent of the Hutchinson sisters of the Emotions at their peak. But the 2nd album? Just run of the mill hip hop girl group vocals especially the awful first 3 songs. The instrumental arrangements of the first had a crisp ""cool jazz"" feel. The 2nd album was just mostly standard (and quite lame) hip-hop tracks. What a waste of the best girl group vocal skills since the era of the Jones Girls, the Emotions, Three Degress, etc."
3,Don't get this for puppies!,"Be careful if you put this on a puppy and then put him/her into a fenced enclosure. I looked out one day to see my little golden retriever literally hanging in her cage! The bone shape can get wedged in the corner of wire ""squares"" when puppies jump up and down. We replaced the tag with a circular shape and she didn't ever get it caught again."
4,Great ginger tea,"I went to the Asian market looking for ginger tea because I was getting sick. Ginger tea supposedly helps you when you are sick (fight infection, inflammation, etc). The Intra Instant ginger tea comes in convenient little packets. The taste isn't too strong and tastes good. The product is from Indonesia so you don't have to worry too much about tainted food. I would buy this product again. Also, the product has 90 calories per packet. However, fewer calories would be better."
1,Daniel; some guy from Argentina,"This guy Mantiak Chia is amazing; he's kind of ""Chopra Taoist"" with dozen of books. I acknowledge him as a real Taoist and Tai Chi Master. He's for real, with a very strong background in internal martial arts and taoism (Iron Shirt Chi Kung is EXCELLENT)BUT most of his new books are kind of ""New Age bla bla bla"". If you want to know the Real Thing about Tai Chi Chuan and Baguazhang as Real Martial Arts,and strong Chi Kung, I strongly suggest to be in touch with Erle Montaigue. He's the ONLY known internal Master who is not after your money and you would NEVER face him on streets."
3,Eye Problems with a Happy Ending,"Blueberry Eyes was written to help a little girl cope with various eye problems including wearing glasses at a very young age (four months), wearing an eye patch and going through eye surgery. It is very detailed, and sometimes uses words that are more complex than they have to be (corridor for hallway). The child telling the story is a seven-year-old girl, and the illustrations are darling. She is depicted as cute and happy wearing her glasses. She is also depicted as having red, sore eyes after surgery, but the pictures are not frightening at all.This book had more information than I needed to prepare my four-year-old for her first pair of glasses. When reading it to her I deleted most of the surgery discussion since that didn't concern us. It was helpful to see little girls wearing glasses, and my daughter was engaged by the illustrations and the story. I plan to recommend this book to my eye care professional as a reference for patients."
1,Very Negative book,"My 3 1/2 year old daughter had to have eye surgery and I was looking for a book to read so she would feel comfortable with the whole process. I thought this would be a good one, but was I wrong! Not only does it put a very negative spin on the whole thing, but it also has the potential to put a lot of ideas into kid's heads. I ended up writing my own book."
3,Pretty good - definitely helped!,"My daughter and I read this book several times before her strabismus surgery and it was definitely helpful in getting her better prepared.We did skip over a lot of it, though, because it just seemed pointless to get into. Also, the author uses a lot of ""big words"" that could make the story confusing and uninteresting for little kids.Overall, I gave it three stars for two resons:- it could have been written better- the book is a flimsy paperback, so it should have been less expensive"
4,Much more than anticipated!,"At first glance you might dismiss a group of gorgeous women playing hard music as a gimic. That would be a mistake as this band has perfected a great style of mid-tempo, melodic, hard rock. The live presentation of the songs is a great show. The band is very tight with great vocals. The singer has a definite presence with an astounding charisma. OK, I'm biased. She pointed at me and dedicated a song to me, but it was still a great show. Put it this way, they won over a Ministry crowd and that is no small feat! See the show, buy the albums. This is one refreshing situation where the looks of the women is icing on a well baked cake."
2,"This album is disappointing, try Kittie instead.","I got this CD expecting awesome, cutting edge female metal, but what I got was disappointing. This CD sounded like worn out, big hair 80s music and was a bore to listen to. The only good songs were 'Enter My Mind' and 'Simon Says'. I ended up selling it in a week. If you want great female metal try Kittie, cause you are not getting it here."
2,Fuzzy Flowers,"The title of this book should be ""Fuzzy Flowers"". I have never been so disappointed in receiving a flower arranging book!Most of the color photographs of arrangements are taken in some kind of 'fog'. If this is done for some kind of artistic reason, one or two would be okay but to show almost every arrangement as though in a cloud of dust or out of focus is just unecessary. The arrangements themselves seem to be quite good if one could only discern their placement and color of flowers.From a technical point of view, the text is useful and covers all one would need to know as a flower arranger.I would not recommend this book to my friends and will give this one to my Garden Club."
4,Not a bad book!,"Whereas consensus here seemed to state that the plot was OK, but the characters were lacking, I think the reverse.The best part of the Battletech universe is not the tedious mech battles (which serve as a good backdrop), but the idea that each faction is complex. No one is a good guy or bad guy, its all a matter of perspective.What I like about Thurston's writing is that (for the most part) the characters aren't either Kai Allard good, or Katrina evil. The characters act in a fresh, unexpected and more lively manner than most other predictable Btech characters. I thought Freebirth was a great example of that, but it seemed to be jeered non-stop. The plot was fairly standard and cliche, but I did like the idea of the inter-clan scientist rebellion.The way I see it, leave it to Stackpole for the big plot twists and stuff and Thurston for fleshing in of details (no offense to the other fine authors)."
4,Not a bad read...,"This was an interesting Battletech novel. I like it because it isn't an Inner Sphere novel and has nothing (well, almost nothing) to do with the 'Sphere: it is only Clan verses Clan; the Jade Falcons verses the Steel Vipers. I am a Wolf Clan Fan, but Falcon Rising was pretty good. When I don't root for the Wolves (since there are only what, 2 novels about them?) I root for the Jade Falcons. I really like the espionage involved in the Scientist Caste and all of the Grand Council Politics. This made me laugh too. If this is your first time reading Battletech, this wouldn't be a bad one to start off with, even though it is a later book in a series. You will like it. Read it. It's worth your 5 bucks."
3,Excellent writer! Dull book!,For some reason or other this book is just boring. The storyline is okay but some of the battle scenes are just plainly stupid. One warrior defeating three mechs out of six pulease! However I am looking forward to Thurston's next book. Bernard Wong is the ape swinging in the urban jungle!
4,mechwarrior proves her mettle,"Mechwarrior diana proves her worth to the jade falcons, and the clans in general, as they defend attacks on Khan Marhe's adapt-or-die policies for making the 'falcons great once again by the steel vipers.Of interst is the fate of that darling trueborn, joanna, and diane's mom takes 007's place in the world of intrigue -but she doesn't come with all the special affects...The underlying message remains constant through- out the book, but I will leave that to you to find."
2,Battletech Universe in Trouble,"Poor performance from Thurston. Some of the intrigue was interesting, but ruined by ridiculous battles where outnumbered and outclassed hero predictably overcomes odds (again and again, book after book). Look forward to return to Legend of the Jade Phenix form (a much better series by Thurston in the same universe)"
2,........Dear Mr. Thurston.....,"You may take some advice from your own work and ""Adapt Or Die"", as Khan Marthe Pryde so elequently put it. Your choice of chacters is ridiculas. You seem to think that we will like them even if they are right b******s. The overall story is good, but these horrible chacters just drag the whole book down. I await a sympathic and all-round Good-Guy type (who actually has a bit of good luck from time to time) in your next novel that will allow me to get stuck into the story, and really enjoy the novel. If you dont do this, at least get a nice heavy 'mech to step on Joanna, there-by killing her off in a satisfyingly painful manner (Kill Natasha Kerensky will she...). Your hopefully, DarronPS. Storyline: 2 out of 2... Characters: 0 out of 3... Result: 2 stars. (Sorry) :*("
1,2nd worst btech book,"Well, at least is was better than FreeBirth. Then again, a cat could right a story better than FreeBirth. This book is boring, tedious, and has almost nothing to do with twilight of the Clans. Don't buy it!"
5,"Beautifully done, the staging does not subtract from the language","I thought that this was a simply staged but beautifully acted production. Unlike some of the earlier reviewers I thought that each character was nicely acted. I particularly liked the clarity of the diction -- every word was reasonably easy to follow. The images are clear; the sound was also clear. The play moves along and I found myself immersed in the production. It was hard to dispell the image of Mr. Guiness as Obi Wan Kenobi. He used a vocal range and tone similar to his famous Star Wars characterization, but I felt that his interpretation of Malvolio one of the best I have seen."
2,Not pleased,"I was not at all pleased with this version of Twelfth Night. Viola had almost no facial expressions, she just looked vaguely pleased for the entire play. Orsino had THE worst wig. Olivia didn't seem to mourn for her brother at all. The only two characters I cared for were Festes and Malvolio. I won't watch it again."
2,90 Re-used Quotes About Living an Excellent Life,"This book contains quotes from 90 people of fame and repute. The quotes have little substance behind them, and if you want inspiration and advice, readWords I Wish I Wrote: A Collection of Writing That Inspired My Ideas, instead. Fulgrum is also donating his profits, and his book is just straight better than this one.Examples (each quote takes up an entire page, front and back, in the book):#29 ""I cried everyday for a pair of new shoes until I saw the man with no feet."" --Florence Griffith Joyner#53 ""The journey is the reward."" -- Greg Norman#73 ""Personal excellence can be achieved by a visionary goal, thorough planning, dedicated execution, and total follow through."" -- US President Ford"
3,Slow Delivery,Product is fine and as advertised. Took a long time for seller to send it with no e mail correspondence regarding delay.
3,No Support For System,"This was a very tough product to research, but due to it's price (only $21) I decided to study up on it thoroughly.I was suprised to find how little information there was about the product, even the manufacturer's website is silent on the product. There were no reviews, and information was difficult to find.After spending a considerable amount of time, I finally found what I had been looking for. This item appears to be a Windows 98 item. I am forced to give this item 3 stars due to lack of support and information."
5,"""Un-noticed, Un-known""","The high-quality, lo-fi AW COME AW WRY presents a celebration of musical precious metals (brass & steel) and the simple waltz for the 1st half. The 2nd half transports you to an entirely different zone where a droning pump organ and 9 person choir massage your weary brain.Matthew Houck delivers a Fantasy-Folk masterwork deserving widespread attention which, of course, it will never get. The record comes off as a joyous day-light party followed by a lonely, come-down midnight. As one of many perfect details, Houck saves his only straight-up Folk song (""Endless"") for the closer of the LP, and it is a gem and a half."
1,Worst PCDP EVER!!,"This is the worst portable CD player I've ever bought. It doesn't display the lengths of the tracks, it eats up batteries like a garbage disposal, and worst of all, when you put the volume up just half-way--HALF-WAY--the sound gets all distorted!! I bought this in a store in D.C. and I was gonna get the Panasonic one, but this one was cheaper, and now I know why. I should have just spent the extra [money]; then I wouldn't have been stuck with the [worst] CD player ever."
3,Ok for introduction to clay,"We bought this cheap at a consignment store, still new in the box. My 5 year old was able to make a small bowl himself, with a lot of supervision from me. My 3 year old had fun using the scraping tools while I did most of the bowl shaping. Don't expect to make the items pictured on the box. Make sure to do this outside as it does get messy. The box says it's for kids age 8, but I don't think it's sophisticated enough for any child over age 7."
3,Not great for younger kids,"My six year old is a little too young for this product. I hope she will grow into it. It is somewhat difficult to control. She still uses it, but not spinning."
3,A nice theory,"I got this microphone for my laptop which does not have a built-in mic. The problem I ran into, and it may not be the microphone's fault, is that with this mic in the computer and sound coming out of the speaker (right next to the mic) I get a ton of feedback and echo.It is a great little mic though, so it would work well for a recorder or a computer where there is more separation between the mic and the speakers"
5,Epicness in a little package,"This is a wonderful microphone and it, unlike my boyfriend, is very sensitive to what I say. lol The noise-canceling technology it has works very affectively, and you can't hear anything but the good stuff on playback. Definitely would recommend!"
3,how do you know if it works,"I have had this for 18 months, and use it regularly for work. I use my recorder with and without the microphone and I honestly cant tell a difference. I don't even know if it works or not. I have asked a few of my peers and they cant tell a difference either. I hope this doesnt stop anyone from purchasing one, this is not my intent, mearly my honest review."
3,Works but I didnt get everything I expected,"When I ordered this microphone it had pictures of all the accessories I ""thought"" came with it such as other covers and an extension cord so you can clip the mic onto other things. But when it showed up all it had was the mic with the one cover that's in the picture. When I went back to the product page on Amazon the pictures were changed to just the image of the mic that I got. I'm not sure if it was a mistake to begin with or someone trying to get more sales."
2,What Happened!,"This baby worked for a few a while then one day just out of the blue it's broken. I don't even know how it broke. I just went to use it and it was broken. ""CHEAP!"" I wonder if i had brought it from the Olympus site would it had broken."
2,Cheaply made,"Small mic + small price = small quality. Buyer beware, you get what you pay for. I'd recommend spending twice the money for something else. I'm not even sure this mic improved my sound quality at all."
1,Mastering Bach F. T. or Testimonials to Sell the Flowers?,"If you want to learn to use the Bach Flowers, this is not the book to study. The main body of this book consists of what amounts to not very convincing testimonials by people who seem to want to convince readers that they aren't flakes looking for new answers to recurring problems. It convinced me that I may have wasted my money on the flowers."
4,Thrashin' like its '86,"Municipal Waste are becoming front-runners in the new wave of thrash metal alongside bands like Fueled by Fire, Merciless Death and Dekapitator. Thrash Metal is a genre not forgotten, maybe out of the limelight, but not forgotten.Bands like Unearth and Trivium incorporate elements of thrash into their music keeping this genre very much alive.Back to the review of this album. Most the songs clock in just under 3 minutes but offer a surge of heavy drumming, crazy shreds n riffs and rebellious lyrics that would satisfy any kid diagnosed with A.D.D. All the craziness Suicidal Tendencies or Slayer would bring plus excellent production? This is a sure buy for anyone still rocking a denim vest and an Anthrax shirt.peace and beer to you."
5,Thrrrrrrrasssssshh!,"Amazingly wonderful party thrash here! These guys definitely kill it, and make you want to toss back several beers (or your poison of choice). They had this girl jumping and moshing around her apartment upon first spin of this sick album. Yes, they are proud of their love of partying, but don't take this band as a novelty act. Really solid musicianship here; great speed and energy without a hint of falling apart or ""going thru the motions."" Definite punk influence here.... all around fast, fun, and furious!"
2,Medieval theology,"On the Soul.Aelred of Rievaulx, a Cistercian monk and abbot in twelfth-century England, wrote seven works about Christian life and spirituality. This short treatise on the nature of the soul was one of his last works. Wanting to make a difficult topic accessible, he wrote it in the form of a dialogue, as he had previously done with his better-known work ""On Spiritual Friendship."" Despite his best efforts, though, this work is slow reading except for those with a real grounding and interest in medieval Christian anthropology. Readers who already know Aelred and would like to read more of his works may be ready to move to this work, but those who are about to read him for the first time should start with something a little more accessible."
5,A Beautiful Album,This is great set of music taken from two concerts in the Mid-West and released on the German Free Jazz Label FMP. The music is relatively quiet with a subtle intensity. Extremely absorbing music. Reichel is beyond description with his home made daxophone. Cora is credited with a daxocello.
3,Medium-quality but worth the price...,These arrive quite wrinkled. The muted colors should look fine with denim or khaki in the spring and fall.
3,beware of the sizes,I bought a medium size shirt but realized that it is two sizes bigger than what i need. The quality of shirt is fine.
3,Not Bad,"Good shirt for price. Wears well, light and comfortable. These shirts do run large. I usually wear a large, and the medium fits perfectly. Only downside is that it is not very durable. Would recomend."
4,Nice shirt... a little big though,Very classy shirt... cut is on the large side. I normally wear a large but needed a medium
3,"DTS decoding is good, but the DolbyDigital leaves me wanting","I've had my system for about a year now. It's a good system for the price I bought it at, but there are definate down falls to it. Any movie I watch I pray for it to come in DTS. That's because when watching movies in Dobly Digital, speach from the center channel can't be heard clearly. I have to almost max the volume and turn all other channels down to hear. The only other fall back is the non-powered sub, but you can buy an inexpensive powered sub and plug into the powered sub port on the receiver. All in all I'd recogmend this system to someone just starting out in their Home Theater ventures."
4,I can almost hear the music,"This book has several stories that make you think. One that causes the music to get into your head... This author has the gift of keeping the reader's attention. It's hard to put down, especially late at night!"
2,Informative but Not Very Helpful,"This book does offer some good information on college majors that our out there. If you are looking for information about majors and possible jobs associated with that major, this is the book for you. However, if you are looking for a book to help you decide on a specific major by evaluating interests (as the title implies), this book is extremely lacking. The message of this book can be summed up like this: ""If you aren't sure about what to major in, take a variety of courses until you find a subject that interests you. If you fall asleep in history, maybe history isn't your thing. Also, don't be afraid to change your major, most students going into college don't know what there major will be and end up changing it at least once or twice."" I got the same advice from friends, family, and student advisers; didn't really need to spend time or money reading common-sense advice that I already knew."
2,Not much there,"I bought this book to help my son figure out what he wanted to major in. It was a disappointment: very basic and skimpy (wide margins, few pages). A major section was just word-for-ford transcriptions of what various colleges say in their catalogs (and online) about the different majors. I had thought it would be more meaty with more details about what engineers, say, actually do and what kind of people might like engineering etc. I guess for someone just beginning (high school sophomore?) to think about college, it might be of some value. I meant to return it for a refund, but the price was low enough that my motivation proved insufficient."
5,WOW!,"I love this workout! It was really different and harder than I expected in a good way. My kids were trying some of the moves and we were all cracking up. I could feel it in my abs the next day. I plan on purchasing ICE for several friends as holiday gifts!!! There are exercises in this video you need to try! The break dance circles and elbow taps were very unique. Fastest 32 minutes ever! I hope Jody makes more, they'll be on my wish list."
2,Disappointed..........,I was disappointed that this CD didn't have the original version that I was looking for. It didn't have the version my friend who is a DJ has on vinyl.
2,Good Cultural Chocolate....Bad Tasting Chocolate,"I have been to Salzburg, Austria, and bought a box of this Mozart Chocolate. It was interesting to get, because everywhere in Salzburg had a sign advertising this. Sadly,I personally did not think that it was very tasty. The pistachio filling had a bad texture, and did not mix well with the type of chocolate used. If you are going to Salzburg, get it only to experience this interesting piece of culture. I would not recomend, however, that you order one hundred pieces of it from Amazon for such a high price."
5,Pro Duracell,"I love the pro duracell batteries. I am a video producer and I use these batteries in my wireless mics. They last so much longer than the standard batteries and I've tried them all. For me, they are definitely worth the money."
4,Work Great,"My family goes through batteries faster than I can buy them. I like Duracell batteries, but the Procell were cheaper, so I gave them a try. They work just as good. I recommend."
5,Low cost per unit on Duracell,"Duracell batteries at low cost, about .35 per unit. I can't come close to this cost local. When buying batteries it comes down to Energizer or Duracell, and I've had Energizer batteries leak, plus it seems Duracells are a little less costly. Thanks."
5,"Name brand, fresh batteries",Long expiration dates and a very good brand at a very good price. I will not buy batteries in a drug store any longer when it's so conveniant to buy them online at a great price.
3,Ok,"Some of the batteries are duds and some are ok. I know this becuase I use it in my wall clock and sometime, after only a week of usage, my wall clock would stop running. Not sure if these batteries are new or a really old stock."
2,The Casseroles Cookbook by Southern Living,The copyright date would have helped me make this selection. There is a recipe in this book that uses squirrel! It is ancient!
5,Finally a break from post punk!,"I am always amazed that such great musicians as Fugazi, with such diverse musical tastes can breed such narrow-minded fans. Reviewer number one appears to fall into this catagory and it's sad. Music shouldn't be so limited and pigeonholed, but we have people like that out there who want all bands to sound the exact same. So, if you want to spend the rest of your life listening to only one form of music then don't listen to this, if you have a mind of your own give it a spin, you might like it."
3,Not as Good as First Book in the Series,"Introducing several new characters (Cotton Mather, Blackbeard, Tsar Peter the Great), mankind is now reeling from the effects of the ""magical"" discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton. Benjamin Franklin continues to be a central character and numerous other fictional characters are introduced. Hinted at in the first book of the series, the ""angels"" or other spirits/lifeforms play a bigger role yet I am still unsure of their purpose in the storyline. While not as interesting as the first book, it was nevertheless an interesting diversion. I will read the third book in the projected four part series."
2,I didn't like this so much,"I didn't like how the book seemed to twist science. The figuring out how to do it is science, but enslaving etheral creatures to do things I believe should not be. The Korai prospect of the supernatural was very interesting, however."
1,EL LIBRO DE URANTIA,"Con todo respeto, Juan José Benitez es un FARSANTE (encarcelado por plagio durante la decada de los ochentas)! Sus dos obras más significativas, Cabayo de Troya y la Rebelión de Lucifer, son copias casi descaradas de otro texto publicado por primera vez en 1955 por la fundación Urantia. Se trata del LIBRO DE URANTIA. Si verdaderamente quieren remitirse a la fuente, lean este libro, una revelación de la verdad ORIGINAL, hecha por SERES SUPRANATURALES ENTRE 1923 y 1939."
2,Frommer's Southeast Asia,False Advertising: The preview contents show coverage of Myanmar but the current edition has excluded any coverage of the country. As Myanmar is on my itinerary I am disappointed.
3,my first dissapointment with Amazon in years.,"I have been an Amazon customer for years, and this has been my first disappointment with the product I bought.I am planning to visit many places in South East Asia, and I bought through Amazon, as I usually do, the corresponding Frommers Travel Guide.When selecting the product in Amazon website, I double checked that the guide I planned to buy contained every place I was interested in, specially Hong Kong. It did.I was surprised when the product was delivered, and I could see that the Hong Kong chapter was NOT included in the Guide I bought.Now I will have to buy another guide, to prepare the Hong Kong part of my trip.That was the first time that the product information in Amazon website was misleading for me."
2,Not very useful for Malaysia,"I find it odd that this book had only 80 pages on Malaysia, compared to about 140 for Vietnam. Furthermore, what information it contains on Malaysia was sparse. Most of the accommodation mentioned was high-end. There wasn't even a map of Kuala Lumpur in it!(I confess that I only spent a couple of ours with this book. After skimming through it, I took it back, and exchanged it for another that concentrates on Singapore and Malaysia. There is a Frommer's, but it was out of stock, so I picked up the Rough Guide, which is delightful so far.)"
5,wonderful,"a must read..... coming of age of a mississippi share cropper... excellent characters... highly recommended.... by the screenwriter of ""Nashville"""
5,Very satisfied.,I have used a friend's cart by another brand and it is very flimsy like it's going to topple over. I was weary to buy anything like it because I figured it wouldn't be sturdy. But this product is actually quite sturdy. I think it really helps that it is wider at the bottom and comes in narrower at the top. The wheels are great and it looks great with the tools in it. Happy customer!
1,No thanks,I was hoping to gain space in my shed instead I lost space. The base is too big and it is awkward to retrieve tools that are towards the wall. I tried to return this product but didn't because the shipping charge would have been almost $50.00.
5,great tool rack,I purchased this tool cart after much research and thought. It does have plastic parts but unlike the other brands it has metal tubes in the critical spots. It holds alot of tools with no problem. It is a well thought out design. I am a home improvement contractor and was shocked to see how many long handled tools I had amassed. I highly recommend this purchase.
4,It was a snap to assemble.,It was really easy to assemble. I have often been told - No Tools needed to assemble. The only tool needed was to cut open the box. Looks good so far.
2,The Ever-Surprising Mathis' Box,"It's just hard to understand why the best voice in America can be under such a commercial repertoire. Trying to be contemporary makes Mr.Mathis go far away from his best picked songs and arrangers from his glorious past. Fortunately, it seems that even Mathis agrees partly on that when he selects his live show tunes, greatly based on his past smash hits."
5,Speedy Deliver delights my son for Christmas,Thanks for the rapid response. My son got to enjoy over two weeks of anticipatory delight seeing his gifts wrapped under the tree and then the unparalled joy of actually enjoying it on Christmas and every day thereafter. Thank you!
4,Great Idea....just slightly off....,"What a great idea. KOCH entertainment putting out a Artist Sampler, they have some really great artists on their label! Unfortunately, they missed out on a great opportunity to let the world know who they are. I must admit it is worth the $$$ for the Radio Edits of ""The Drapery Falls"" (Opeth), and ""Pressure"" (Anathema)....also the Live track from Entombed and a bonus track off of Opeth's ""Blackwater Park"" re-issue. The other tracks are also very good and varied. But my gripe! Where is new stuff from Paradise Lost or Cradle of Filth? The total CD running time is only 45 minutes.....KOCH could have made a trully remarkable collection by putting MORE great artists on the disc....they could have come much closer to the much beloved Identity discs from Century Media. Let's hope that Volume II will make up for what Volume one lacks."
2,Meet Sailor Venus review,"this book had a lot of info that you already know, and the pics were probably just taken from the internet. i already knew all the stuff it had. the captions under the pics were either sideways or upside down, so i kept in turning the book, and it's annoying."
4,Nice Book,"I relly love this book. This has correct info about Sailor Venus and lots of nice pictures. It has her attacks nd transformations. If you don't own this book, you should soon!"
5,This book rules!,This book is the #1 authority on sailor venus info. Sailor Venus is my favorite sailor scout! she's the coolest!
5,Sailor Moon FAN,"I had these before but they got stolen in a house move. I love the details, the color printing, and just having it to my collection is a must!"
5,Great Book for Sailor Moon Fans,"This book is great for Sailor Moon Fans. It gives a detailed description of Sailor Venus's life as a sailor scout. I will admit, there are a few mistakes, but the rest of the book makes up for those. Has great pictures and poems too. I would recomend this books to any Sailor Moon fans!"
3,"Good information, poorly presented","Alden Amos should have used a ghostwriter. This book is about 3/4 useful information and 1/4 commentary intended to show that Mr. Amos is one of the ""in crowd."" He uses cutesy terms like ""Princess Twinkle"" in lieu of Sleeping Beauty or ""Oil of Oompha"" for Oil of Olay. This in itself grates, but can be overlooked. Also, he implies that only mental defectives and klutzes use double treadle wheels. Throughout the book he makes several snide references to spinning amateurs and the mistakes they have made in his presence or while dealing with him.There are many, many mathematical calculations in this book. I have never been good at math and this whole section daunts me. I simply spin a yarn that looks like what I want, without making any calculations, and so far have never been disappointed.There are also several diagrams for making spinning accessories like niddy noddies, spindles and so on. If you are into this sort of crafting, the book would be useful for you."
5,tons of useful info for novice and intermediate spinners,"I bought this book because I am fairly new to hand spinning and wanted to know more. Boy, this was a great choice! Working my way through it slowly, it has already proved a serious font of information, answering questions that I hadn't put into words yet. It's easy to read, unabashedly opinionated, and funny. Highly recommended."
3,An admittedly opinionated author,"Alden Amos calls himself opinionated, and he is. If you want to know all about spinning on a traditional (preferably Ashford) wheel, this book will help. If you are interested in alternative techniques and/or are not using a standard wheel, you will not get much help. I am always wary of authors who know the one true way to do anything."
2,Lots of info but hard to get through,"Too wordy, only line illustrations and a flamboyant writing style ,which makes the text hard to get through, gives this book a 2 star rating. Page 16 seems to indiacate that the writer has very little confidence in your being interested enough to continue and has a paragraph entitled ""Why You May Want To Read Further"". The book does answer some questions about handspinning in general but, in areas where more detailed info should have been provided, there's nothing. For instance, I wanted to find out how long I should steam a skein of yarn to set the twist. Pages 199 to 201 tell me nothing (except that steaming is best for wool).If you've done some spinning and want a book that interesting in its approach then buy this book. If you are new to spinning or want good reference books for your shelf then you'll be much better off with ""Hands on Spinning"", ""The Ashford Book of Spinning"" and a subscription to ""Spin Off"" Magazine."
4,The Alden Amos Big Book of Handspinning,"Great Book, lots of information. Alden definately has he own likes & dislikes with is definately shows in this book.I found parts of it confusing, it is too Technical."
5,Gift for Godson,This is the third volume of the Navarre Bible that I have purchased for my 17 year old godson. He really likes them as he is serious about his Catholic faith and finds them a help in studying.
1,Save your money...,"I love Paper Mate pens, but these are terrible... the ink doesn't come out right away, so you end up scribbling on something to get it started EVERY TIME!!! It isn't just one or two in the box, the whole box is like that!!! I also bought a box of the red Kv2 pens, and they are the same! These are cheap for a reason!"
5,A Great Book,"If you like Gary Larson but don't know which book to buy, this is the one. It is hilarious, has cow stuff. I asure you you'll laugh your brains out. Well, at least it happened to me"
3,"many redundncies with the 2000 edition, but worthwhile","Money spent on a good laugh is always money well spent and Gary Larson almost never lets you down. Problem is: Gary Larson doesn't make any new cartoons anymore, so the off-the-wall calendar each year warms up another best-of selection from the vast trunks of his work. Nothing wrong with that. They are all great. This year's calendar in addition had hilarious historical comments from past milleniums. Now I have already sneak-previewed the 2001 selection of jokes and find many redundancies with this year. While there are a lot of favorites that I have been dying to see again, there are some that could have gone back to the trunk for a little while longer. Overall impression: good enough to satisfy Larson-junkies, but not outstanding. Gary, pick up the pencil and draw some more!"
5,Hilarious,"The Far Side is my favorite comic, out of all. It is positively loaded with randomness that will catch you off guard. Larson's comics are the kind that makes you think about what is going on, comparing the picture to the caption, and it is hysterical. There are scizophrenic kangaroos, plane driving sheep, duck relays, and pretty much any other twisted idea out there.ANY Far Side book is one that will never fail to please."
4,A New Office Ritual,"When I started work at my present job almost two years ago, I found that the place needed a little 'lightening up'. It was casual already, to some extent, so on my next 'office supply' shopping 'trip' I picked up this calendar for my desk. Well, it began a new office ritual; everyone wants to know the ""Far-Side-of-the-day""! Sometimes, it's the only funny thing to happen all day. Larson needs to come out of retirement!"
5,Always Brilliant!,"Gary Larson never ceases to amaze me. I've been a religious follower of The Far Side for as long as I can remember. I love the way he looks at the lighter side of life, yet some of the comics really hit home. My favourite still is the deer with the target as a birth mark! Go Larry - you're my super hero!"
5,"Funny, absurd cartoons","Sick, absurd humor is Larson's specialty, and in this collection, Larson is at his best. Many of the cartoons involve reversals of the roles of species, where animals get their revenge on humans. Others are based on themes from popular culture, such as Tonto on his horse outside the outhouse telling Kemosabe that the music is starting. They are funny, but there are times where you have to spend some time interpreting the diagram. If you are a fan of Larson's unique brand of humor, then you will love this collection."
4,Rock''m Sock'm Boxing Title Match,"You didn't expect it but there you are (or someone you know) transported to center ring against your dreaded opponent, 'Cancer'! Luckily, there is someone in your corner who has experience and knowledge to guide you against this towering opponent. The book offers help from Round 1 thru Round 15. The book is realistic, compasionate, and practical. The Buchholz's speak from the heart. They covers topics patients and familes need to know about; treatment options, alternative therapies, clinical trials, emotions, managed healthcare, family dynamics, etc. There are short narratives about real people to bring out important points and pitfalls.It is hard to give a book of this type 5-Stars because so much of what makes the book a success goes on within the patient or those that relate to the patient. The book itself is a guide, it doesn't give you ""The Answer""."
3,Pretty Good Track,"the Instrumentation,Vocals&Arrangements have there Moments here.not My All time fave TTD song but it's Pretty Cool.TTD covers a wide range of styles."
3,It is a good knife with one potential fault.,"This knife is well made. It feels good in the hand, and it is easy to operate. However, I do not use it as much as other knives I own because the blade wiggles a bit, making me think that with a great deal of pressure on it, that the blade might break, with the piece or pieces of the blade going I know not where."
5,Couldn't Put It Down,The hardest thing about reading a book that you can't put down is when it ends! I want to know about the rest of Paul and Jenny's life together!Really enjoyed the book and look forward to reading your second novel!
5,great grips,I bought these grips for my granddaughter. She is a level 6 gymnast and these grips are perfect for her. She says they fit great and give her the grip she needs to do tricks on the bars.
3,It's okay,"A very slim book - could easily have been fleshed out with the addition of 50 pages or so which would have made it worth the money.Readers are expected to have knowledge of the men's pro circuit - no background is given to orientate newbies to the sport.Lots of names are dropped, but since the author doesn't focus on any one person, hard to keep interested."
1,Edited version,This cd is an edited version of the London Studio cast cd on Jay CD's. The JAY version is the first complete recording of the full score and the only one using the original arrangements. Do not buy this shortened version. Spend just a little more and get the full recording.
5,Trucks gone mad... pure genious,Well... at first my friend L-train and i were renting Trucks for a good laugh... we found ourselves at the end of the movie hidin under blankets because we were so scared. Just emagine your truck coming to life and locking you in the back! Freaky... well my favorite parts would have to be when the old hippie knocks the druck cowboy over the head with a bottle and says peace man... that shows his character really well... but my overall favorite scene would have to be when the tonka truck kills the mailman... pure genious... who would ever think of that? it was amazing... the blood was so real and gory... it was my fav! Well I still ponder why there isn't a Trucks 2... maybe someday we will be lucky enough...
2,i am pissed...,"not only because this movie sucks so badly, but because i actually bought the thing. A suggestion: get the ORIGINAL Maximum Overdrive, based off the same Stephen King story this one is. MO is much better; in fact, it's one of my favorite horror movies of all-time, and I've seen alot of them.Overall, if you're a fan of over-the-top campy acting, a storyline that doesn't work as well as the original, and overall a movie that just plain sucks, then my friend, this one's for you. If you have even one brain cell in your body, then don't buy this Ford P.O.S. (if you can tell me what movie that's from, I'll personally pay you $20...) You'll be glad you didn't."
3,Lukewarm Review,"I guess I didn't think this movie was as terrible as everyone else did. The blood and gore reminded me of strawberry pie, and the part with the mail carrier was incongruous, but it kept me interested. I think the movie should have tightened in on the cafe and dropped the other scenes, except for the junkyard scene. The acting wasn't bad; the young boy was actually pretty believable. The special effects stunk, but I didn't hate it. It's not a movie I will watch often, but it was okay.To tell the truth, the three stars were for the ending. (No spoilers, don't worry!) Suffice it to say it wasn't one of your Hollywood ""and they lived happily ever after"" endings. I liked that."
3,"Like Maximum Overdrive, toned down.","I don't agree with most people about this movie. I think that it was a toned down version of Maximum Overdrive, but still worth watching. If a person is completely into possessed inanimate objects, this is definitely a movie worth watching."
1,just to clarify,This is the same story as Maximum Overdrive. The original short story was called 'Trucks' from the Night Shift collection of short stories. I am not sure why they tried again after the horrible result of the first attempt.Stephen King directed Maximum Overdrive and in subsequent interviews I heard him state that the movie was one of the worst movies he's ever seen. He hated the result of this project.
2,Sucks!!!,"First of all, i'm feeling generous giving this movie 2 stars. this movie sucks!! (So you know this movie is a remake of ""maximum overdrive"") And what the hell? A toy truck kills somebody!! Yah you heard me, KILLS somebody. Listen, if you want a good movie of the same genre, get stephen king's ""maximum overdrive"", great movie. ""Trucks"" is the worst movie iv'e ever seen in my life and I am ashamed that this movie exists. what an insult to ""maximum overdrive"". It doesn't deserve to be on dvd nor does it deserve my 2 star rating. PRAISE TO STEPHEN KING'S ""MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE""""TRUCKS"" sucks!!!!!"
1,not bad enough to love,"TV movie version of the King short story contains some truly loony scenes. (like the guy who tries to escape the trucks by fixing his broken truck. D'OH!)When the trucks of the world unite against mankind, it's up to ""thirysomething""'s Timothy Busfield to save the day. You'll root for the Peterbilt."
4,Another oldie but goodie of Stephen King,"This is a great movie based off of another great short story by Stephen King. It was a bit old, but the actors did a great job. The action was great and the gore was also great. Somewhat cheesy at times, this is my favorite type of horror flick. I also find that most movies based off of Stephen King stories that are also directed by Stephen King, tend to give him great justice. He is a great author and director (and even a nice actor). I think more people should give him the credit he deserves and if you are a Stephen King fan this would be a movie that you would like! It blends in with his usual genre as well. You won't be let down by this movie, I sure wasn't."
1,HORRORIBLE,"If you are looking for comedy, this horror movie is the place to find it. This movie is based on the unbelievable premise that trucks and ultimately all machinery are out to destroy the world that the humans have neglected. This movies bad writing is only out done by its bad acting and lack of imagination. Even with such an elaborate, shock laden script this movie follows the formulaic horror movie motif and direction. It is an absolutely incredible movie if one is in the mood to decompress and laugh about the zanier side of the film world. As a horror movie this picture lacks luster and just about everything else needed for it to succeed. It is, however, a scream to watch, only not the scream that was intended by all involved in the project."
1,"Stick with ""Maximum Overdrive""","This television movie, based on Stephen King's short story ""Trucks"" is a complete waste of time. Stick with ""Maximum Overdrive"", a better adaption of the story that stars Emilio Estevez. You can find Maximum Overdrive on DVD for a great price. If you really want to see this film, wait til it comes on Sci-Fi channel."
2,read this before you buy!!!,this movie totally blows. it is a complete waste of time and i am now dumber for having watched it. maximum overdrive is much better. i would even say 1000 times better. in fact maximum overdrive has been my favorite movie since i first saw it back in 1994. i would strongly advise you to rent trucks before you buy it!
3,Trucks,"Stephen King let me down witht this movie. It was kinda far fetched to think vehicles could actually do what these did in this movie. I guess maybe if a meterorite actually hit earth and made electrical forces possible, this type of thing could happen. This movie is an okay movie, but I know Stephen King has lots more that are great!"
1,Watch the original maximum overdrive instead,"This film is a rip off of Maximum Overdrive which is a far better movie.The acting in this one sucked, it seemed like the actors were reading off of cue cards. There was no story and unlike maximum overdrive where all kinds of appliances also went haywire, this was primarily about trucks. And the trucks were growling like dogs. Whats up with that?I fell asleep during part of it. The original 1980s? 90s? Maximum Overdrive was a good movie, watch that one instead."
2,Not good,The original was better maximum overdrive is better. I should have not purchased this but it us what it is
4,A Good Read,"Though this book started out slow I ended up getting really into it. The representation of court life is very visual and the life and sorrows of the characters are really interesting. You feel for the narrator and her troubles, and wish only for her to have things set right. You share her anger for her rival, and in the end I wish she would have put her in her place. Unfortunately the book ended too abruptly for my taste, for I hate things ending with unfinished business. A good read despite that, of a land and time that does not come around too often."
2,Knee High Striped Halloween Witch Stockings - Red,The black band is a little too tight. I like the stockings but for an average size witch this creates a little problem. I have to wear them as socks.
4,The best book I've found so far on the subject,"I teach technology to adults on a daily basis, and I also teach teachers technology. I have read a fair number of books on the subject. To date, this is the best book I've found. It covers a wide range of topics, and takes what I consider to be many of the best pieces from other books and puts it into one.So why do I give it only 4 stars? Well, I haven't found a book yet about technology that really jumps out at me, and says ""This book is completely awesome, and every teacher should own it"" But this is the closest I've found to that, other than ""Computers as Mindtools for Schools"", which is not as comprehensive as this book, but goes into territory not charted as well by any other book I've found."
1,So Sorry,"This is my first book review. I bought this book new 4 or 5 years ago for a graduate course in Education. I was then an MA student, and I remember it particularly well: such a waste. Buy it if you must, but pay as little as you can. I defy you to make sense of it."
5,Good choice versus more expensive choices,"I do recommend this brand/model. It's well worth the money and meets more than my expectations. I'm currently using it while in grad school to become a family nurse practitioner. I can clearly see the important landmarks while viewing the eyes, ears, nose and throat, even tried it on my dog ha ha ha it works. In comparing this particular instrument with the welch, as well reister, & many other expensive choices I can't tell a difference nor do I see the need to spend more. This particular model even came with disposable speculums, as well as the reusable kind. I most certainly recommend this particular model, kind of silly investing in one of the more expensive ones if this is just for school."
5,ENT Kit,The ENT Kit was purchased for a medical student and it was perfect for what was required. Shipment was fast. Great product would recommend it to anyone needing this item for their education
2,Not worth it,"You certainly get what you pay for with this kit. I am a PA student and I purchased this particular ENT kit thinking it would serve my purposes for the low cost. The opthalmoscope light was dim, and the lense had a hairline crack in it. The otoscope is not much better. My classmates Welch Allyns are by far superior. Dont waste your money"
2,Poor Quality,"I'm a resident and wanted a cheap otoscope/ophthalmoscope for home use but was disappointed with this product. The focal range is ok for kids but poor for adults. Thus it was hard to get a good focus on the tympanic membrane. Also, compared to Welch Allen models, the light is actually in your field of vision. In my research, a good model costs quite a bit more, so this product is worth it's price."
4,Good,"Needed for school. Has come in handy, since I have children. Saves on doctor bills, when their ears are fine."
3,Med School,"Gets the job done but, after comparing my set with others who purchased the Welch... I should have paid a little more. My light is not as bright or as white as I wish it would be. When compared to the other brand, it feels cheap. But for the price, I guess it will do for now until I finish school."
2,"Good otoscope, terrible opthalamscope.","I am in my first year of medical school and I bought this for use in training and rounds. Do not buy this if you actually want to see any part of the eye. I could barely see the red reflex and once I followed it, got a huge reflection of the LED light right back at me in a very small viewing lens. Visualization of the fundus is impossible.The otoscope is just fine.You get what you pay for!"
3,US MS1,"Did not try the ophthalmoscope. Otoscope has a very short focal length. I have to jam it all the way into my patient's ear and still can't focus on the bony landmarks. Had to return it. Great customer service, smooth return process and full refund."
2,Cheap Option,One of the bulbs burned out after the first time I used it and the battery shifts around inside. The Opthalmoscope light is also dim. I wish I invested in something better.
3,I wouldn't buy this,"Ophthalmoscope: You can not see any details inside the eye beside the red reflex of the retina.Otoscope/fundoscope: This works fine.Overall, it is a nice cheap set but I wouldn't use this on my patients. I bought this to get me through school; but I use the Welch-Allyn set that my school has on the wall and the difference is amazing. I can see everything with my school's set."
2,Big,"I bought this as a gift for my wife. She is a Nationally Certified Clinical Medical Assistant, working in a family practice clinic. She did not like this, because it is very heavy and bulky. I am sending it back, because she wants a lighter, and less bulky case."
4,good basic kit,"Good for beginners. You'll be able to see most of what you need to see with this kit. The flashlight is a little weaker than I've seen on a few other kits, and there are no other light options for the ophthalmoscope attachment (cross-hairs, slit, wide view). For the money, I'd say its a pretty good deal though."
3,A good diagnostic kit for the price,"I'm a medical student, I curse the 4th year and needed a diagnostic kit for practice at consulting room of medical clinic for the price this seemed like a good option, the ophthalmoscope works great! otoscope and also, the problem I had was that after 3 days of using the otoscope head seems started making false contact and the light suddenly shuts down during the practice with the patient, is very uncomfortable ... but only the head of the otoscope."
5,Excellent!,This is an excellent buy...I researched many product sites and this one was the best. The equipment is sturdy and complete.
4,Not bad for the price,"As a student, I just couldn't look at the more well-known brands because of cost. Looking at other reviews, I figured I had a 1 in 4 chance of getting an adequate unit - so it was worth a shot since I could always return it if it didn't function. I was surprised... it actually did just fine. In fact, during the assessment exam for a class (which is why I bought it), it was clear that what I had was better than some of the other 'off' brands some folks had bought. I'm getting good use out of it, so it was definitely a good bargain buy..."
3,MS1 - it's okay,"the lightbulb on my opthalmascope burned out within five minutes of use. so did the one in my roommate's. we ordered the equipment at the same time.granted, a replacement is only 8 bucks, but it's really inconvenient and very disappointing.otherwise, its basically sufficient. no fancy bells or whistles. good for the money."
3,Not his best...,"Dr. Rat doesn't flow anywhere near as well as the other Kotzwinkle I've read (The Bear Went Over THe Mountain, Fan Man). With chapters MAYBE reaching 5 pages it's not supposed to flow as such. It is intentionally choppy. I think it makes it harder to appreciate this book and the satire (often times uproarious) inside it. However as something to read while making coffee each morning or something in small installments it tells an interesting story. However funny comments aside I personally wish it had the flow and pulled me in like his other work has done. Still if you like his brand of humor and satire there are MANY lines here that will make you laugh out loud, even on a subway!"
4,very funny,"Some readers may find the book a bit graphic at times, but it is necessary in order for the reader to understand the cruelties being committed. More often, however, I found the book hillarious. Several times, I had to laugh out loud, which I don't often do reading. Dr. Rat's encounter with a homosexual rat is one of the funniest things I have ever read. I highly reccommend this book."
3,Against expermintation done on animals,I think experimentation done on animals should be against the law! Animals have no say in the matter and the only way they can escape it is to dye! No animal should have to have that as the only option!
2,the horror of Dr Rat,"I first found this book when I was 13, living in a small French town. The only English bookshop was my escape route...then I bought Dr Rat. Even the first few pages made me feel ill...I distinctly remember a passage about kittens' vaginas and microwaves. In our home, books were treasured, and my dad was bemused when, in tears, I ripped up the book and burned it. It gave me nightmares for a long time. If you love animals, avoid this book."
2,"Writing is fine, but couldn't take the violence toward animals","There is certainly a place in literature for books like this. From what I'd read, novels like ""Animal Farm"" or ""Watership Down,"" written from the point of view of the animal, are great works with very important messages.I'm not sure if this book comes up to those standards, but I'm noting the similarity.I simply couldn't handle reading about the torture of lab rats. I got through a couple of chapters, but just had to quit. Perhaps it changes tone later on.I wouldn't discourage anybody from reading it, simply saying that my stomach couldn't take it."
3,Grand and Sorrowful,"Anthropomorphic animals revolt! The first and the last chapters of this book were definitely the best. Those first chapters were hard to read, though. They were very sad. Kotzwinkle does not use grisly words when describing the maltreatment of laboratory animals. He's clinical and candid, which is disturbing in its own way. Heat oven to 250. Insert tray of kittens, paws taped down. Note plaintive cries and vaginal bleeding. I don't know if any ofthe experiments he described are real, but he sounded [mad]. He then goes on to report the horrible treatment of all sorts of animals; from domestic dogs to cattle. Horrible, horrible, and sad. All of it sad. Made me a little ashamed to have pets. The revolt that started in a lab extended to all the animals of the world. The book ended on a global scale, both grand and sorrowful."
2,Not for Animal Lovers,"There is nothing wrong with the book and it is well written and clever. The thing I did not like about it was the detailed descriptions of the experiments on animals. It is necessary to the story of course, but they were obviously taken from real experiments, and I didn't like to read about that stuff at all, especially in vivid descriptions. Again there is nothing wrong with the book as such. It is just me."
1,"Should be NO STARS, Such a terrible book!","I love pet rats, and have had them many times throughout my life. I started this book, Doctor Rat and was throughly DISGUSTED...could not get past the first chapter. To hear how these sweet animals are tortured in the name of science sickens me. Seemed like author thought it was funny, in my opinion.Author should be paying us to read this awful book. Deleting off my Kindle app."
2,Grim,"Well written, but grim and unpleasant in outlook. Unrelenting horrors of labratory torture of animals. Couldn't finish the book--the story never seemed to move forward, just piled nasty image on nasty image."
1,Doctor Rat,"To my taste this book is gross. If you like blood and guts, this is for you. I read a couple of chapters and deleted it. Ugh! A complete waste of time for me. I wish I had tried the sample. That is really a great feature."
2,A little strange,A book about animal experamentation from the animal point of view.A little hard to follow.ot sure wether I like it or not.LOL
5,"If you can get it, read it","To summarize the story; it is about an Animal Revolution against mankind. Every single animal has joined this revolution except for one, Doctor Rat.Throughout the book the author attempts to give perspectives from both sides (the animals and Doctor Rat's) but the main character (Doctor Rat) is really a character that had been admittedly driven insane by the very beings he has sworn allegiance to.Animal lovers, political zealots, and anyone with an imagination should enjoy this book.**Because of some of the language and graphic descriptions contained in this book some people may be turned off. Though that is understandable I still recommend this book."
1,Mostly PETA propaganda.,"lousy writing, no real story. Obviously written by an animal rights advocate. I like animals too but good grief Charlie Brown. Did not hold my interest long enough to finish the book. Glad I didn't pay full price."
2,Does not live up to expectations,"While the sound from this unit is quite good, it is a frustrating unit to deal with. The colors do change . . . but, contrary to what the owners manual states, you can not turn the color changing feature off while the unit is playing. Nor can you turn the colors off when the unit is not playing. So if, like me, you put this unit in your bedroom you now have a very bright nightlight to keep you company. The company did replace the unit when I complained, but the replacement works exactly the same. In order to sleep I either have to cover the unit or place a piece of cardboard in front of it to shut off the light. Would I buy again? No way."
1,cd player doesn't work,"I ordered this product 10-1-11. When I received it, it didn't work. The return process was a joke. I waited 2 weeks just to find out what to do to return it. Had to return 1st before they would send a new one. They have to look at it and deem whether it functions or not. I had to pay the shipping to return it. It is now Nov 3rd. I have never heard from them. I know they have received it. I am waiting to find out if they are replacing it."
2,Help!,"My stereo is great, I love it. But even when its off it makes this annoying humming sound. I've tried unplugging the speakers, but the noise is still there, so its from the main unit. Does anyone have any ideas other than calling the manufacturer?"
1,No frequency listing? How do you know if it works?,"I'm giving this product a 1 star review because it doesn't list the frequency or range of frequncies that it operates on. It only vaguely lists that it works somewhere in the VHF range. Are we consumers just expected to buy this and be stuck with it if it doesn't work because of radio interferance? If they bothered to post the frequency range under the product description like most of the other wireless microphones do, than pershaps consumers can determine before we buy it whether or not it will work in our environment. If you purchase this item, you're gambling that it's going to work. If you're in a small club in the middle of nowhere with no other RF use anywhere nearby, odds are it will work. But if you're like most people who use wireless mics in a very crowded RF environment, not knowing whether or not this mic is going to work before you buy it is not acceptable."
3,Product Works Ok,"Sorry for taking so long to post a review- was waiting on a new cable I also had to get in order for the product to work correctly. After getting the cable, the Audio-Technica has worked alright. It is a bit inconsistent and produces sound that sometimes shorts out. But it's worth the price."
3,"Interesting early 70s Iran, but poor re-issue","Giti was an iranian singer from the late 60s and early 70s famous for her mini skirt and flower power type attitude. Her music is popish iranian folk with touches of Beat. The music in this CD is very interesting and a historical document. Unfortunatelly the CD reissue is very poor and is not made of the original masters, but rather from poor third generation copies or similar."
5,Shirley Murdock is blessed and her vocals are off da hook!,"I have loved Shirley's music for over ten years, when I saw all her albums on Amazon, I felt like I found the old school that I've been searching for for soooooo long. Shirley has a strong, electrifying voice, with power and soul, that moves me to want to belt out her tunes whenever, and wherever I am. Her lyrics are tight, all about good values, love, and serving the Lord.I'm gonna add all of her music to my collection and let all of Barbados and Toronto know that this woman must never be forgotten, she's one of a kind.--Pearls, Barbados,W.I. / Toronto,Canada"
1,The Exploding Cigars of Doom,"If you are a mad scientist and need some convoluted, impractical and easily escapable way to kill agent 007 this book might be of some limited use. It's devious schemes are on the order of sulfuric acid in a Visene bottle. The ideas in this book might seem slick to some twelve year old kid but are not worth the attention someone with a more than passing acquaitance with reality."
4,Bite Sized Dog Information,"This is a well written, interesting book. It is not a chapter-book, but a dictionary-like assembly of dog behaviour/postures/physiologic/biologic information. Good for understanding the workings of dogs based on wolves, not good for trying to get tips on how to housebreak your dog or teach him/her to sit and not chew up your things."
5,Lanny North,"Excellent book for all two-leggeds. The format is encylopedic, but what seems intuitively to be a fault is really a plus. The book has become close to number one on my shelf of books directed at learning dog. Short of growing a tail, this book will yield rewards in enriched relationships with the four-leggeds."
3,Good Dictionary.... A refeence book,"This book is really a dictionary that may help to understand some of the words, terms used by some trainers, vets... However, if you are interested on undestanding in a deeper way some of the behaviors, and dog signals you must read other book. In general the book is not bad because it gives you a good idea of the terms and behaviors displayed by a dog. I do not think this is a good book for a typical owner that would like to understand his/her dog signals..."
4,Good Reference,"Good book on reading body language of dogs. Easy to read and understand, great reference."
3,Ok as a quick reference,You'd be better off buying a more thorough discussion as contained in How to Speak Dog: Mastering the Art of Dog-Human Communication by Stanley Coren.
1,Not Satisfied,"This was not at all what I thought it would be based on the description, etc. on Amazon and I was very disappointed."
2,not what i hoped for.,"this is the ""americanized"" laurnea'. not too good. her voice is beautiful but i don't feel that its a soulful voice, therefore, shouldn't be on these tracks. the track are too r&b and should be for fantasia or someone like that. the loose ends flavor fits her voice better, or over broken beats (nujazz flavor) or she should work with Agent K (Feed the Cat 2003). he is out of London and that flavor music fits her better. I am kinda sorry i wasted my money on this cd. the cd is full of talent but imagine your football greats in the NBA or NHL...........exactly, her voice does not fit the production/musicians on this CD. Someone before dared to compare her to Erykah Badu. not in the same tree. Erykah is more abstract yet pinpointed with nice basslines in her music. I don't see this here. if your'e simply looking for something a little different this will be your CD. If you are looking to get lost in the music, this is not it."
3,"Lish in the kitchen, picking up crumbs.","Characteristically blurring the line between fiction and autobiography, the proper and the profane, Lish has created yet another beautiful and disturbing rant. Of all the expressions of grief, megalomania is at least the most creative, and here Lish lets the verbiage fly to the point of creating a new poetics, a language where the discerning reader (unfazed by Lish's blatant sexism) might find empathy for a thoroughly unlikeable narrator. ""Epigraph"" is a challenging ""novella"" that, while not one of Lish's best works, adds to his reputation as a postmodern busboy, and casts crumbs of brilliance on the dirty floor of literature's kitchen"
2,The ego has landed,"The ego has landed! This novel began with an idea that,finally, wouldn't expand beyond the author's idea that he is gordon --Gordon! -- and we should all pant at every word. It's unfortunate because Lish is a superb writer of short fiction. We have 155 pages, with about 50% of the left hand pages blank and many of the right facing pages are less than half filled. Finally, the throbbing ego here makes the blank pages the best part of the story. John Herrmann <herrmann@libby.org>"
5,Recess ROCKS!!!!!,"I liked all of the songs, especially the ""Green Tambourine"" song. I really like the video. I liked the part in the movie where Spinelli jumped on the Ninjas. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! The bad guy really WHOMPS!!!!"
4,williams review,I had this album a while ago and i loved all the songs on the albumnow i am re purchasing the album due to loss of the other album
4,"Great service, great shoes, great price!",My son just loves his new Heelys! He could keep them to go to bed if I would let him !
5,awesome movie!!,this movie is so so funny! and it shows african way of life and british way of life. i think it is kewl :D
1,Total Junk,"I regret buying this thing, but did not do my research, as I should have. I based part of my decision on Newegg's reviews, which I will never do again. I think Newegg has great service, but their ""reviews"" are stacked and Newegg will not post negative reviews.This Kworld USB 2.0 Combo TV Box TV Tuner has a 1 second lag between the video and sound. If you like watching 1970's Kung Fu movies, you will love it. I don't.The manual is a joke. The product is not listed on their website. There is no technical support. Did I mention I regret buying this thing?"
5,Just as described.,"This aquarium salt is great. Not sure how the fish like it, but they havent died or anything. This salt is also much cheaper than going to a pet store."
3,It's aquarium salt,It's salt for your freshwater fish aquarium. Shipping is a bit high or I would have given it a better rating. It's good stuff.
2,I expected more. The book is too superficial.,"The book was not what I expected. The hints on the book can be found in Microsoft's white papers and chapters are too short. The part of Active Directory planning is very simple (the white papers of Microsoft are more complete). The concept of active directory is confuse and primary. The approach of OUs, group policy and delegation and security are very superficial and it doesn't give any foundation to implement this features of Windows 2000. The figures are too big (it looks like to fulfill pages and for the book have more volume). The case study developed throughtout the book and the worksheets and forms provided on the accompanying CD don't help you to understand the concepts explained on the book.If I can give you a little piece of advice, read the book before you buy it."
1,"For kids maybe but not for ""children""","As a teacher of third grade I like to read some jokes to the students. The title said for kids, so I thought I would read some to my class. After a few non-laughable ones, I started reading through some and discovered that most of the jokes would be accepted well by middle school students and above. Some were very tasteless including cannibalism. Do third graders need to mull over jokes about cannibalism? I didn't read those to the students so I ended up marking the ones that were acceptable (maybe two out of five or so). Still most were not funny and needed explaining to the students. What made me surprised was that the book was offered by Scholastic Book Clubs at the 2-3 grade level. I would pass on this one unless you are over the age of 12 or so."
1,sad...so very sad....,"Yes, this version is terrible. Occasional snippets of the song are recognizable before it falls into generic techno beats for most of the track. To correct a previous review, the original is from a band simply called ""Pigbag"", and if you don't have the original vinyl, it can be found (still?) on the Canadian compilation ""Hardest Hits Vol. 2"" (1992) SPG Music Productions Ltd. Stick with the original. It is AMAZING. DISCLAIMER: I'm not a biased Pigbag fan. This track is the only one I know by them. A simple comparison between the two leaves Thunderpuss in the dust. Don't waste your time/money on this one, people!"
2,washed out,"A bit like Simply Reds version of the Valentine bros hit ""Moneys too tight to mention"" - this cover version has nothing of the driving energy that characterised the original recording."
2,Contrary to popular belief its NOT a Thunderpuss original,Papa's got a brand new pig bag was originally released in 1982 by the band Papa's Got A Brand New Pig Bag. If any one is as lucky as me and still has the original from that time they would soon realise how this remix destroys a classic instrumental track.
4,We like reading this book!,"One note, though. You really can't lie down and give this one a good read; the eyes roll back so the whites are showing.We love the illustrations and the rhymes on this book. It's a really cute and fairly inventive storyline. I don't really like that sometimes the dinosaurs are called names. ""No more nut-brains da dada da da..."" isn't really such a great thing to teach to kids. I recognize that it's just a loooooooose translation of the scientific name (which is cleverly worked into the rhyme).We have fun reading this book. I like to barely jiggle the book while reading it so the eyes jump all over but you can still read the words.In all, it's a fun series with a clever bit of artistry worked in."
3,very useful,"This book was very interactive for many students, especially those students who are visual learners. This book is a counting book that can be used to introduce to students the concept of counting backwards. It also contains many scientific dinosaur names and this can lead into a lesson over dinosaurs and their habitats."
3,Subliminal advertising,"While I like the story, I find it very disturbing that there is a picture of a coke bottle on almost every page and they get bigger as the story goes on. I like coke but that leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
4,Ten Little Dinosaurs,This book is fiction. It is about Ten Little dinosaurs. It takes place in many different places. Each page one Dino disappears. The book counts down from ten to zero. The author likes to rhyme on every page. I liked this book because it teaches kids how to count from zero to ten and teaches kids about the different types of Dinosaurs.
2,Does not hold up to Why Why Why,"The eyes are cute and funny, but the book could have been much better. My three year old wants to know why everything happens in the book and some of it doesn't make any sense since the author couldn't be bothered to find rhymes that made sense. We like the dinosaurs, but why use a made up word like ""mooth""? Why spleet, bleep, spleet with no clear answer what happened? Why is the ""policeman on a trike not pictured""? Why baseball all of a sudden? And why bones in the sun? As many others pointed out, the coke bottles that all the ""kids"" are drinking are a pointless addition to the story unless it was a Coke advertisement.There are much better books out there, I don't recommend this one."
2,book review,"For some reason I expected the book to be larger,. It was very small. It came in good condition etc but the size surprised me."
3,Mooth?,"My son loves this book, and the artwork is really cute, but the writing leaves much to be desired. Also, unless you hold it at the right angle, the eyes are creepily rolled back in the dinosaurs' heads."
3,"Good gymnastics, but NCAA mislabeled","This item should have been titled ""Lady Razorbacks in 2006 regionals"". Although the gymnastics was very good, this video focused solely on the 2006 Arkansas women's team at their regional finals with the exception of 1 beam routine by UCLA Bruin(and former Canadian national member) Kate Richardson. This video has nice well-educated gymnastics commentary provided by the Gymbacks staff who produced it. I was hoping to see other teams perform, especially UCLA and Florida. Also, the final team standings printed on the back of the box don't match what is shown on the video."
3,Lather shoes from Kenetha Cole (Slip Through),HiI have bought a slip through lather shoes of a keneth cole.Generaly Im wear a size of 10.5 in shoe but some or how 10.5 of these shoes doesnt fit to me.So I think you nedd to order 0.5 size larger than your regular size.The lather is easy to get wrinkle on it.So think once before you order these shoes.It's get wrinkle very easyly on it.The patern is good and the comforatble bottom ia aslo a plus point.
4,This was a good product. I don't have ...,"This was a good product. I don't have children myself, but my neighbor does, and she's in the market for something like this product. I used it myself (I ate a large quantity of poppy seeds to see if I'd come up positive for anything) and had no problems at all. The directions were easy to understand and follow and the process itself wasn't so bad. I told my neighbor to go right ahead and buy one."
1,Misleading advertising,"Although I looked for a cable and cd driver for the Pantech C300, and this item was listed as working for that phone, it turns out that the cd driver is not for this phone, so my son needs to research online and try to find the correct driver in order to use this cable. So far he can't download his pictures from his phone and the cable is useless. This is very misleading advertising."
4,usb cable & driver ....,"GREAT people to buy this from,I live in N.Y. & I had it in 2 days!!!read the print may..... it DOESN'T work without the software you DON'T get! I tried contacting these people, I told I would buy whatever else I needed and I NEVER heard back from them.... when you order make sure you have it all!!!!!"
3,Meh,"Well, most of the functionality seems to be missing, but the cable works. I can get pictures off the camera without paying $0.25 each for them."
4,great for travel,this is a handy guidebook that is light and easy to take with you on your trip. Great information and decent maps.
2,Pretty Much a Waste of Time,"This book is too, basic, and does not mention anything but the obvious. I left it behind to save weight and space and that was an easy decision."
4,Calculos,"Es una herramienta muy util en el calculo de los diferentes parametros thermo quimicos.Tiene un presentacion amigable y facil de entender para el lector, locual lo hace un libro de consulta permanente para personas que trabajen en topicos afines."
5,Cotton product review,"I was so pleased to at long last find sterile cotton for my use. In every store that I used to be able to find it, rolled sterile cotton is no longer available. I do not like cotton balls. They are not adequate for my use. I recommend this source for those who use sterile cotton for other than removal of makeup. It will last me for quite some time."
3,cotton roll,good value for price - however quality of cotton within the roll varies and is not consistent. thickness is not consistent.
4,Mostly Music Info.,"Hi. I got this set mostly to see what kind of music the extra cd has on it.Fist off, the music cd has nothing to do with Pokemon. The only theme in common on both disks is that they are about Christmas.The songs on the cd are as follows:1. Up on the house top2. Have yourself a merry little Christmas3. Santa Claus is coming to town4. I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus5. Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer6. Frosty the snowman7. Silver bells8. Deck the halls9. Jingle bells10. Here comes Santa ClausSo, if you want only Pokemon related Christmas entertainment, then get Pikachu's Winter Vacation on DVD and Pokemon Christmas Bash on CD.But, if you're a grown-up wanting Christmas music that both you and your children will enjoy, this set might just be for you.Hope this review helps."
5,Excellent Experience,Excellent experience with this entire watch purchase. It came before the promised delivery date. The watch is everything I expected it would be. I will shop here again!
3,Infinity and the Mind,"This book is packed full of a lot of good information on infinity. However, the author's philosophical position on infinity is a bit extreme, outside the mainstream of mathematical thought today."
2,How disappointing!,"I know that most historical fiction is just that; 'fiction', but this book was highly implausable and improbable, the heroine is masochistic and the hero is not just ""wounded"", he is a jerk, and I could not find one redeeming quality in this man. Ms. Joyce puh-leeze return to writing about strong alpha male rakes with hearts of gold. If this is your first Brenda Joyce book, please read her earlier novels, they sizzle."
2,This is not up to par,All I have to say is this. How many times can a man blush! Very repetitive and frustrating.
2,Disappointed!,"When I bought this book I had already read several Brenda Joyce novels. So I was expecting this book to be as good as the others, but it wasn't. The book started off well then went down hill. Sean and Elle had nothing in common. The whole time Elle was trying to find out what happened to Sean. She was so annoying!! Don't get me wrong this book isn't terrible its just Brenda Joyce usually writes such good novels that this one was a surprise."
2,how to meet your one true love at a family reunion?,"I really couldn't find a way to support these main characters in their quest to love each other eternally. I just couldn't get past the idea that he used to think of her as a sister and then she became hot and then he had the hots for her. Pardon me, but I want my characters to be strangers or at least not family relations before they take the leap and fall into forever love. This book was a bit on the disturbing side for me. I gave it two stars because the writing was okay even if I hated the plot. Can't recommend this one though."
3,I was a little bored with this one,I really like the De Warenne series but this one didn't keep my attention like the others. I was disappointed with this one.
4,3 1/2 stars...maybe 3 and 3/4 stars,"The plot did not bother me. The taboo didn't bother me. Step-brother and step-sister erotic/romance did not bother me.What bothered me was how it was written. First of all, I thought Elle was just a little too...dumb. And Sean, he was so miserable, I wanted to hug him and comfort him myself, and all Elle would do was continue to tell him how she believed they belonged together.It got better after a while, but then I felt awful for Peter. I wish he could have had his own story! It would have left the reader with a better feeling had he have been a heartless, cruel, rake.My biggest irritation though, was the exaggerated way the dialogue was. Everything was exclaimed like a soap opera.But, really, besides these few things, it's not that bad of a story."
3,AWW! I REALLY wanted to like this one!,I'm so sorry and I feel like a rat but this really was not good. I LOVE Branda's books but this one was dissapointing. I had no problems with the stepbrother/stepsister thing (there is NO blood relation)..but I had a problem with the lack of true passion. Brenda is usually known for her passion but these love scenes seemed kind of mechanical and Sean was just downright annoying! I'm still buying her next book..I'm just sorry that this one was not to my personal liking!
1,What a disappointment!,"I am a BJ fan. In fact, I think that her Francesca Cahill books are some of the best in the romance genre despite the fact that she left us hanging with no consummation of the relationship. Despite that, I have continued to enjoy her novels. I couldn't even finish this one. It was so boring, and I couldn't get past the dichotomy of what a closeknit blended family this was and yet this brother and sister were a couple. The book lacked passion and, frankly, often didn't make much sense. I was hoping for the best and was totally shocked at how bad this one is!"
2,A disappointment,"I've loved Brenda Joyce ever since I read ""Promise of the Rose"" and cried my heart out... but I'm sorry to say that her latest de Warenne books, including this one, are nowhere near as captivating as her older work. After reading this book, I realized that nothing much really happened in the story... most of the middle part takes place in one room and most of the action there involves the same tired conversational exchange. I kept plodding on loyally, hoping to be struck by the same heartbreaking poignancy of her earlier stories... unfortunately, it never happened. I just finished the book a couple of days ago and I can't even remember how it ended -- it was that unmemorable."
1,Horrible but read for closure,"The good thing about dynasty books like these, is that you get background with other characters, and dialogue with the ones you like. Absolutely disliked this novel.But good to know how Eleanor became Mrs. O Neil! Will be trading in!"
2,What the hay?,"BJ took a nose dive with this one in my opinion. Kind of reminds me of the sad downslide of Johanna Lindsay. Same thing happening here. She usually has such strong, passionate writing but this novel was so redundant that I have to think she was just writing it to get it over with. Taking the easy way out. Hopefully her next books will get her old spark back. Please!"
4,Great Story....,I really enjoyed this book. I am one of those reader's that the book has really got to be good to hold my attention. I couldn't put this one down. I thought it was a great story.
1,Elementary,This book is all but 108 pages. The text and diagrams are representative of texts on computer science written in the '60s and '70s. The book also includes a loose page correcting page 13. There are better books out there for the non-technical reader.
2,"Alright, overall; very shallow","Read it, but only if you don't have high expectations from the start. If you know absolutely nothing about ecommerce then use it to ward off sleep during a plane flight, no more. It's the bare minimum anyone would like to know about the topic. Mr. Shaw tells one this, so no false expectations are aroused. And yes, that loose leaf correcting page 13 is a tad bit unprofessional. Graphs and tables are very unpolished."
1,A very disappointing birthday for my gandaughter,"I was disappointed - the doll that was shown on the website with teeth was not the doll that I received. This was for my grandaughter'g birthday. It is VERY frustrating when you can't get back in contact with you when there is a problem, no telephone number just the website...by the time I went through all of the confusion the birthday was over...I had to settle with a doll that was not what I ordered..I also incurred extra expense by purchasing another doll at WalMart and much to my dismay was not what I wanted..so the whole birthday surprise was ruined. I will not purchase through this website again."
3,Solid Set for Completists,"Like the others in the series, a solid roundup of northern soul/r&b; of the 1960's (not including Motown or Philly) of course. No real hidden gems or forgotten tracks (many are on other collections) but solid northern soul - more so for completists of the genre & era.Like the CD cover, it's professional but not overly exciting nor was all that much creative effort expended in putting these tracks together. It's good, just not great.(for great - check out Zealous Records Presents Soul Sides)"
5,"Complete, beautifully photographed and written.","In addition to its beauty, Schiffer's book is complete and historically accurate. This is a book you will read over and over again."
4,Nice radio for the price,"I got this radio yesterday, and for 10 bucks it is pretty good. I use this at work, and it has good reception and clarity. If you need a radio on the go, this is pretty good. It needs AAA batteries"
4,GOOD VALUE!!!,"I like the good reception; it takes a little bit of pratice to fine tune in radio stations. The stereo earbuds sound cheap; so I recommend buying name brand. Sony headphones really improved the sound quality. The built in speaker sounds cheap, too. The convient neck strap and bet clip make it easily portable. It looks great also. Overall, it's a great value for the money."
3,You get what you paid for ...,"Let's face it, this is an inexpensive product and you should not expect much. But given that, it is okay value for your money.Pros: Compact design, option of using speaker or headphones, neckstrap, belt clip.Cons: Reception is not very good at all, will only catch strong stations and even that not very well. Speaker quality is very mediocre.Bottomline: If you want quality, spend $40+ and get a Sangean. But for what it is priced at, I wont complain."
1,reissue missing complete lyric booklet,"this is a good album but poor reissue because it's missing the lyric booklet. it only has a 1 page cover insert. if u want the lyrics, but a used copy of the original issue."
2,Disappointing,"I had a lot of expectatations when I bought this album, having listened to her songs for about 5 years now. It just never grew on me no matter how long I listened to it. A few songs are okay but the rest of them are really disappointing. It does not have the spirit of her other albums."
2,Not her best work,"I wish I could be more enthusiastic about this CD, but she seems to be working at it a little too much. Also, the energy seems lacking..."
3,Sub par for MCC,"Mary Chapin-Carpenter is one of my all time favorites. And yet something told me to hold off on buying this cd. My instincts were pretty right on target. THis is the 1st instance where I could have passed on basically the whole album. Most of the previous recordings were chock full of fantastic song with extremely few songs I didnt love.Place In The World was a complete surprise to me, therefor. It was uninvolving, disspirited and just plain boring for the most part. There was very little varitey in tempo and style. Far to many cliched statements filled the lyrics. Compared to her catalog this is without a doubt a lead baloon, one that i will not be hurrying to listen to soon. I'll be gettting her newest cd (Time Sex and Love) soon and feel confident I will feel much better about that one."
2,Fairly Lousy Disc,"How could she follow up Come On, Come On? She obviously couldn't with either this one or Stones in the Road. COCO is my second favorite disc of all time behind Marc Cohn's first one. This disc has a couple decent songs, Naked to the Eye, Place in the World and ...Italy. There are far too many filler songs that don't have nearly the energy of Come On. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Ruined by ham-handed drumming,"I have been a fan of Carpenter's since the mid-80's, but this album is very bad. The main problem is the overwhelming basic beat laid down by the drummer, which is so annoying that it makes it impossible to pay attention anyhitng else that's going on. This has been a problem on previous MCC recordings, but not to the extent that it is here. This is the only MCC album that I've played only once and then disposed of: give it a pass."
1,You call this country?,"I came across Ms. Carpenter's ""Down At The Twist And Shout"" on a country assortment album and thought it was a super song. So in browsing in a music store I came across this album and bought it on the strength of ""Twist And Shout"". All the reviews I see on Ms. Carpenter is that she is such a great singer and songwriter. She wrote all of the songs in this album and I guess they all mean something to her but they do nothing for me. Every song seems to have the same beat and rhythm and goes on forever. I listened to the album three times to make sure I wasn't missing something, but sure enough, every song was awful. I won't play this CD again. I've been a country music fan for over 40 years but this is as foreign to me as the acid rock of the 1970's."
3,Solid but nothing spectacular,"Mary Chapin Carpenter does a nice job on this CD and considering her talent this is faint praise. Nothing really stands out in this collection of tunes, with Carpenter commenting on life and love with her usual lyrical depth but without the musical force to back up her words. There is nothing here to dislike but then again there's nothing that's going bring you back to this disc again and again."
4,I liked it.,"Mary Chapin Carpenter is my favorite artist, and though this is not my favorite of her albums, I did like it. It lacked a little of the poetic lyricism that I have come to expect, but ""Ideas are Like Stars"" shone. ""I want to be your girlfriend"" lacked something that ""Shut up and Kiss me"" had, but ""Keeping the Faith"" and The Better to Dream of You"" delivered."
2,Was Verdi a composer?,"This book is a nice overview of Italian politics during the life of Verdi with a subplot regarding European politics.The author spends pages describing the literary source of the operas, more pages describing the libretti and then after describing the Theater and singers intrigues, there is the most flimsy description of the music. Arias duets etc are hardly ever discussed in musical terms and details. Plot weaknesses and strengths are usually discussed. This is repeated for every opera.Poor Verdi and his music are reduced to comprimario status in this ""Literary Opera"".It is a pity because the author writes very lucidly. I just think he is off topic too often."
1,lo peor del folklore,soledad se hizo famosa en nuestro pais por agitar un poncho en sus recitales y por un fabuloso mecanismo de marketing. Luego se ha dedicado a destrozar algunas de las mas bellas canciones no solo de Argentina sino de toda Latinoamerica. Ojala sirva para que sus seguidores las busquen en sus interpretes originales donde veran como tienen un sentimiento que esta chica no puede jamas alcanzar
1,mal ejemplo de musica latina,"si a ud le gusta soledad, le va a gustar este cd. Si ud no la conoce y quiere oir buena musica latina, en especial, un reflejo de la argentina, no lo compre, por favor. el cd es malo,solo se pueden rescatar las bellas canciones pero es preferible por otros cantantes"
5,EXCELENTE VOZ,"Uno de las razones por comprar este album no es por su bonita cara sino por la potencia y el carisma de su voz, sería perfecto que cantase sin música para disfrutar mucho mas de ella. Aún así, la conjugación de su voz y la música que la acompaña la hacen ser única en su género. La recomiendo 100%, es uno de los pocos discos que no me arrepiendo de haber comprado por una o dos canciones. Todas en este CD lo valen."
3,good product for the price,"I bought this pillow because the back of my bathtub was vertical and against the wall, so it was not comfortable to lounge in. The pillow made a huge difference - my baths have been much more relaxing. However, I have had a couple issues with it. The outer fabric does not dry quickly. So if it got wet when I showered in the morning, it would still be wet that evening. It is also strangely difficult to deflate. That is good when you are lounging on it, but not so good when you want to wash it."
1,Don't buy,Cover takes at least 24 hours to dry and does get moldy. The inside blowup much larger than cover which makes it hard to blow up enough to be comfortable.
2,Too high maintenance,"The cover is 100% cotton and tends to develop mold if left on the pillow after using (if it gets wet). To keep it from molding, you have to remove the cover, launder it, and then put it back on the pillow. This is too much maintenance for everyday use."
2,Disappointed,"This book was poorly organized with a sophmoric writing style. I was sorely disppointed by the contents of this book (although many of the pictures were quite nice). The writing style was almost painful to read at times and it would have been better served to have subtitled this book ""Oh And I Met James Cameron & I Know Alot About The Making Of The Movie Titanic.""I will say that the book is physically well made with lovely glossy paper and (as stated earlier) has many pictures I've never seen before in other books on similar topics. But the book suffers terribly from the writing style, lack of cohesion and tendency to concentrate (incomprensibly) on isolated topics or events while glossing over others.Not worth the price of shipping, let alone the price of the book itself."
2,Not for Elementary Portfolios,"The book has some good ideas, but the title is deceiving. This book is not intended to be used for designing portfolios for children in the elementary grades. Great resource for using portfolios in the upper grades and beyond."
2,Southern Gardening - overly chatty,"I was looking for garden info and a gift book for a knowledgeable gardening friend. This book is VERY chatty with unneccessary fluff. I don't have time to read all the side chatter. It shows invasive plants in the small color images section. You would not know unless you went to the text that these are non-native invasives. I would prefer more direct information, illustrations near the text they apply to."
5,Going back to another time,"Given my age, this beautiful book brought back all kinds of memories of dinner parties I used to be able to give...."
1,save your money!,"I found this book to be overly simplistic and superficial. If you've never read a self-help book before this book may be a helpful. Otherwise, it's just basic self-help regurgitation, with simple morality tales that seems highly unrealistic and the strategies to help solve problems are slightly condescending (take a dance class, a brisk walk, etc) and quite honestly, nothing you haven't heard before."
4,Judgement Day (1988),"Judgement Day (1988) In 1689, the people of a town made a deal with Satan - if he were to lift a deadly plague, he could have the town alone for one day each year. Unfortunately for Charlie and his college buddies, they chose the wrong day for a visit!This was complete fun to finish. If it had been made in the US and and not in the Philippines in the 80's, it might have been another The Brotherhood of Satan (1971), but now it's just forgotten and buried."
3,Who taught these folks how to pack & ship 'stuff'?,"This is the 2nd time I've ordered this product. I received the 1st shipment with several damaged cases. This last shipment I paid more attention to the packing: the cases were put in the bottom of a big carton & lots of 'packing paper' was put on top & on the sides! FLASH guys: bottom of the carton - where the cases were unprotected - is what gets banged around & where damage occurs! I hate to be sarcastic but it's so obvious & elemental that this kind of 'poor' packaging shows thoughtlessness & lack of consideration! You guys need to improve your 'packaging/shipping services'! I feel embarrassed to have to say this, but, guys, get your act together. This was not the time I've had this happen!BPNYC"
2,"10 of mine were broken, too",Maybe a whole bunch of these were dropped. Ten from one corner of the package were broken. They are not very sturdy. The price was good though!
2,dvd/cd cases,at least 10 of the 100 came broken. this is not the first time this has happened with your cases. it must be a quality control problem as most the damaged cases were on the inside. I will not buy your cases again.
1,I'd give it 0 stars if I could,"As others have said, these cases are a great way of throwing your money away. Roughly 4 in 5 are broken out of the box, and the rest are so cheaply made I figure the hinges will snap after opening them more than 2 or 3 times. Avoid at all cost."
2,LOW QUALITY-WON'T STAND-UP FOR FREQUENT USE,"Unlike most reviews, I only had two cases that were broken. But the overall quality of these CD/DVD cases is poor. Certainly can't be confused with OEM cases and for that matter, most of the replacement cases that are on the market today. The cases are very fragile and must be handled with care. Good for storing away media but not for frequent opening and closing usage. On the positive side, I purchased these cases directly from Amazon and the packing was good and shipping was quick."
3,Some Broken!,"The cases worked ok, except for the dozen or so that were broken and unusable in the box when I first opened it. I purchased 500, which shipped in one box, so I ASSUME that smaller purchases won't have as many broken when they arrive."
2,Item not packed well... arrived broken,"I ordered these jewel cases for my daughter's sweet 16 favors. In a 100 pack, about 25 of them were broken. We did not have time to return them, so we used what we could and bought more from best buy."
2,Do not ship well,The cases might have been great had they arrived in one piece. Unfortunately great care was not taken in packaging the cases. They were put in a box 2 to 3 times too big and bounced around during shipping. The items were returned and I will stick to buying the cases off the shelf.
1,Now I'm Really Broke!!!,"Of the 3 dozen or so of these cases I have used to date roughly half are shattered, fractured, busted, broke, unusable, and a sad commentary on Fellowes, Amazon, UPS, or all of the above. I want a 50% refund asap. I mean it."
2,cumbersome,"I find it much more difficult to navigate this book than, say, Moreland and Fleisher's book of Latin grammar. Furthermore, it's verbosity is frequently difficult to penetrate. The author seems to have an aversion to synthetic explanation, relying instead on an overabundance of examples that serve to clarify little of the readers confusion."
3,"Nice resource, but very confusing","This book was a required textbook for my third semester fo Latin. It is very resourceful, however it is extremely confusing and hard to follow the sections. Maybe it is because I started Latin with a different textbook, I just felt that this was less organized in structure and hard to look things up quickly. If you are looking for a resource book this is for you. However if you are looking for a textbook I would go with something else."
5,Turn up the volume,"Try as I might, I can't think of any reason to give this compilation less than five stars. People have commented that the transitions between tracks are too abrupt, but they work well enough.All tracks have great build ups, show sufficient complexity to raise this music to the next level and employ many layerings that make relistening a rewarding experience.Disc two is slightly better than the first. My favourite tracks are Flaming June by BT, and Gamemaster by Lost Tribe.This is a great buy for fans of trance and those who are new to the genre. This is one of the first trance albums I bought and I haven't found anything better. Even non-trance fans should appreciate the variety of tone colours, infectious rhythms and anthemic quality."
5,Trance Nation 2,"Product came pretty quickly and in good condition. Just some old-school music I once had, but lost. Glad to have it back in my collection"
5,the best god damn cd in the world,this is the best god damn cd in the world it is so influentul a master piece
3,Overhyped and overpriced,"This double disk set with its fancy slipcase costs 45.99 here in Canada and I'd just like to know why. All the tracks are nothing new and each song has that basic trancy high in the middle of its length. There's nothing wrong with that, I don't really mind how it may seem too formulaic for people. But there's too many songs on each disk, and mix doesn't get a chance to really go into each song and make you care for it. This is basically just the year's best songs on a double disk cd but the mixing is sloppy at times as the transition from each song to another song isn't really that smooth. I'm not testing Ferry Corsten's skills as a DJ, but he's probably capable of more. If only they could make him part of the Global Underground series. . ."
1,Deja vu,"1.0 out of 5 stars Deja vu, October 2, 2008By Cristina - See all my reviewsI bought ""Spilling Open"" because it was quite different from all the things out there at the time.""Brave on the Rock"" had interesting pictures.""Messy Thrilling life"" has only the introduction to recommend it,that's why i bought it.Whatever i thought to find in this book,it wasn't there.It seem all the books of Ward Harrison could be in one volume,they are repetitive and show us that she has not grown as an artist.In my view,she never had potential as a writer,most of her book are quotes from other people,and i don't find inspiration in someone that seem to be dealing with the same issues over and over.Whether you are interested in art journals or looking for inspiration for your own creative journals, there better books out there.I doubt I will buy another of her books."
2,"Decent read, but won't keep you up at night.","This variant on the explorer-in-over-his-head/alien invasion themes was a good enough read, but did not engage me as thoroughly as a Chalker book usually does. Explorer/Scout Bar Holliday comes upon an empty ancient colony ship in orbit around a mysterious planet full of a race of herd animals, but no humans. When Holliday lands to investigate, his life (and mankind's) is changed forever. With this book, Chalker appeared to be trying out a clever idea or two, rather than writing a straight ahead sci-fi adventure."
3,Good lite sci-fi,"I read this book based on a recommendation by a friend of mine. I liked the story, although it was really more of a fleshed out short story or novella than a true novel. Enjoyable, easy reading without anything to really hurt your brain. It's very suited for a person who is exploring the genre and isn't ready to dive deep into the hard SF or the multi-book epics. Just don't set your expectations too high and you will enjoy this for what it is; fun, a bit goofy, and very easy going."
3,"Another good, but not great rock band","In a over-populated music style like rock is, originality is always a good thing. If you have it, then you probably will stand out from the rest (see Linkin' Park and many others).The Color Red is not an original band, but it's a good band anyway. They do rock, the same rock like a lot of other similar bands (TRUSTcompany, Breaking Benjamin, The Blank Theory, Trapt, Epidemic, Pacifier, Earshot...do I must continue?) They're all relatively similar, but hey! they're all good! If you like one of them, then you probably like all of them, and if you're listening music 24/7 like I do, then you'll have no problem to hear'em all.My favourite songs are 'Intro Season' and 'Sore Throat'."
3,"After years of dust settling, A Decent Album **1/2","I was huge into metal and nu-metal for a couple years. It's basically all I bought. After I got married, the need to constantly increase my blood pressure lapsed, and I sold all my nu-metal stuff (it was a LOT). Before I sold the albums, I made copies of about 10 records I thought I had the chance of liking again. The only one I've listened to and liked, 4 years later, is ""Clear"" by The Color Red.Well, I guess ""liked"" is a strong word. I enjoy some parts of this album, but for someone who now despises all that hard music he used to love, that's saying something. I think TCR's appeal comes from the fact that they're not really nu-metal at all. Their just hard rock with a touch of progressive. Songs like ""Soar Throat"" and ""Wrong Replacement"" are still good. And though people will probably forget them (who even knew they existed in the first place?) this is a pretty decent album from basically out of no where.Overall: 5 out of 10."
4,My gun is quick,I liked it. Couldn't totally say I loved it. The action parts were still great but some parts it slightly dragged but not enough to make me hate it. But overall pretty good.
3,More of the same from Spillane,"Private Detective Mike Hammer meets and befriends a prostitute known as 'Red'. The next day Hammer finds that 'Red' has been killed in a hit and run. He's convinced that it was no accident but murder, and vows revenge against those responsible.'My Gun Is Quick' finds Mickey Spillane in a rut. Once again a friend of Mike Hammer's has been killed and once again the private detective is out for revenge. In 'I, the Jury' it was a wartime buddy, in 'Vengeance Is Mine' it was another friend, in 'The Big Kill' it was an orphaned child's father, and now in 'My Gun Is Quick' it is a hooker with a heart of gold.Spillane was just going through the motions in this one. Half-way through the book you will already be able to guess the ending if you've ever read any other Mike Hammer book."
2,"Well, ok...","This movie sounded interesting, so I decided to watch. First off, Amazon says this movie was released in 2007--- it looks more like 1977. There is NO POSSIBLE way this movie was made in this decade or the one before. This movie is shocking in that it is almost ridiculous. It pulls you in and the entire movie you are waiting for that happy ending, or at least a resolution of some kind. Well, no. That is not what this movie gives you. It is depressing throughout and ends on a slightly more depressing note."
5,excellent album,"This album has some great sound, tons of great tracks. It's quite long, definitely worth your money, and the songs are classic. This was my first Jimmy Cliff album, and made me fall in love with his music. His lyrics are powerful and socially conscious (often quite sad) while his rhythms are upbeat and positive."
4,For the ADVANCED student of Tai Chi,"An excellent book of Taiji Qigong theory. As an instruction manual, you will find that there are many places within the text to get swamped. An instructor to guide you through these pitfalls is an absolute MUST. All in all, it is one of the best Chi theory books I have read. I intend to collect all of Stuart Olson's books. He is a great writer and a very well studied man. Thanks Mr. Olson."
3,cute and slightly weather resistant,"first thing, cute boots. got them in red and have received many compliments for two winters over these. second thing, living in colorado i stomp through a fair amount of snow, they have no traction and water will seep through these...just a bit though! also, the snow leaves stains that are easily removed with hot water and a wash cloth. and third, without a zipper or elastic, they are tricky to get on and if wearing winter socks, they dig into ankles. but over all, i have worn them for two winters here, and they are decent. highly reccomended for winters without snow."
4,live,"Just saw Sebastian live in BERMUDA at the Just for Laughs show at Fairmont Southampton Princess hotel.. loved him.. loved the ""foot pedal"" will say no more rated him rather than the DVD as just buying it but he was a def 4 star live show would prob have 5 if got to see more rather than quick sample of him..."
4,great time to spend watching,"the humor is real and clean enough to be able to repeat it to others, a very rare thing now a days; ""good job"""
3,HUGE Sabastian Fan - DVD Does not do him Justice!,"I really love sebastian maniscalco, his comedy has even brought me to tears I laughed so hard! But pains me to say that I was dissapointed in this DVD. It doesn't feature his best work, I'm not sure how this specific venue and the material used was selected to be his debut DVD- but it did not showcase his best work by any means. I'm dissapointed to give this a 3-star rating, but I'm crossing my fingers he'll push out another DVD sometime in the future."
1,Dont buy if you already own his first dvd,"I was very disappointed when I watched his ""second"" dvd. Its the exact same thing as his first dvd, just with a different title. What a rip off! I like Sebastian as a comedian but I dont know if I'll be buying anymore of his dvd's. If you already own his first dvd dont buy this one."
5,easy to listen to,"This is a great begining/intermediate cd set. Speaking in very clear, pleasant voices, Mark Frobose and a native Italian woman cover a lot of information. I just wish the CD set was a 12 set instead of only 6. I have 4 different ""learn Italian"" CD sets and this is, by far, my favorite."
5,Dino Does Dance Music,"You have never heard Dean Martin like this! It is not for everyone, and I'm sure that people expecting the Rat Pack Dean Martin of old will be very disappointed by this ""noise"", as my mother would call it.""Sway"" is difficult to catagorize. It is electronica with a sort of slower latin, rumba-style beat. And it might make you think that you can put old wine into new wineskins. Although some may not like the taste, I just want to drink it over and over again. But, like wine, too much of it could leave you with a headache in the morning.My only disappointment is that there are only three cuts on this disc. I would really like to hear more of this creation."
5,No one provides more profound insight into internationalism,"Global capital is building a new world, but there's a spectre haunting it. While Communism as we knew it has evaporated, mass strikes and upheavals rage in dozens of countries and insurgent networks spread their tendrils across the borders of nations and regions. The outsiders are raising fists - and joining hands - in ways the architects of corporate globalism never anticipated. No one provides more profound insight into the meaning of the new transnational struggles than Peter Waterman. Read `Globalization, Social Movements and the New Internationalisms' to get the inside story of the outside story.(Jeremy Brecher, author of `Strike!', `Global Village or Global Pillage', radio producers, film-maker.)"
4,From the visual effects to the sound - DHTML Black Book.,"The book combines all technologies that sourround web development. It really introduce what is dhtml (not as a proprietary technology) but as a combination of a set of technologies like CSS, DOM, Javascript, etc. From the standards to the production the book also cover animation in dhtml, sound, visual effects and awesome demonstrations.IT's cool for beginners as encouragement, and perfect for web professionals as the gold resource."
2,"700 pages thick, but only worth reading 100","At first I thought that I have bought the best book about DHTML that would launch me to a more advanced use of DHTML. But I was wrong, very wrong. The book is hard to read, the examples are never really explained from line to line and the CD-ROM is worthless. I have spent a lot of money on this book and recieved nothing. I am now thinking of buying a nother book. Although there are some usefull information in it, but not as much as I thought."
4,Very technical \/ | CrossBrowser /\,"I think this book is indicated for web developers. The book includes very technical information of many technologies (IE related and Netscape related). There are many cool examples and source code, Not all are fully explained."
2,Knoppix Information Overwhelmed by Dumb Dummies Jokes,Not fond of Dummies series. They need to get right to the point and leave out their lite humor.
1,reviewer friends,"I have not read the book. But it is rather easy to tell when a review is written by a friend of the book's author. A) you can't find any other reviews by any of them and B) each one says more or less the same thing, giving it raves without any reservations or criticism at all. Too bad because it tell us nothing about the quality of the book."
5,Wonderful!!!,Great resource to open children's mind to science outside of a book or a classroom. I am a science teacher (4-8 grade) and I used this book in a summer camp. The kids LOVED IT!!!! They were excited and ready to go each day. If you are looking for a different way to get students involved in science while teaching them key concepts this is your book! I am waiting on the next one!
4,good old family values,not as good as the first few seasons. No John Boy and no grandpa. Even the mother-Oliva leaves mid season. The lessons aren't as good but the values are still good.
5,The Waltons are the best,This season is just as great as those preceding it. We felt the loss of Grandpa just as if he were a member of out family. We have every season of the Waltons to come out so far and plan on purchasing the final seasons.
2,very disappointed,Buyer beware !!!!!!!5 episodes are missing from this Waltons Season.Do not buy anything from this supplyer as I think it may be bootlegVery Disappointed
5,Walton's,Watch the walton's all growing up. Now I watch them with my daughter. Nice clean family shows.
2,"This series is a classic, but this release is definately flawed.","This is my favorite series now. It is so much about people and relationships (family and neighbors). I'd give the series 5 stars normally. ***** for the content, * for the flaw.This release is missing two episodes, the first two, and copies the last four, on both sides of Disc 3. I don't know if this is a fluke, but I hope so. I am returning it and getting another, in hopes of getting what is advertised. No other reviewer says anything of this, so I'm hopeful.8-21-12 - I have returned the defective discs and gotten a replacement. The new one has all the episodes, plus the last four doubled on both sides of the disc. As long as they are all there, then I'm fine with it (23 episodes). It puts more episodes per disc side, so it uses 5 sides instead of the full 6 sides (as written on the cases)."
5,I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!,"This series is one of the best ever! The characters are all so deeply developed throughout the years. It takes a simple theme -a family living through the Great Depression era and into WWII, and makes everyday life so interesting. I've watched it over and over , and will continue to.Thank you Earl Hamner, for sharing your story with the world! I'd recommend ""The Waltons"" to anyone!"
1,Not up to par,"I was really dissapointed in this series, I had gotten all up to this one, and it had so many bad episodes in it that, I quit watching them, and will never buy another one."
5,Russia found the Basses,"On another recording of the Vespers Rhachmaninov was quoted as saying ""If I write the music, Russia will find the basses.""With the basses this is a totally different piece. Incredibly rich and beautiful. I am torn between wanting to finish a movement, and backtracking to experience an exquisite passage again and again.(No.11 kept me from the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl live.)I don't think I have ever heard a choir so responsive. And Polyanski requested the impossible. The dynamic range within a single bar unbelievable. Intonation impeccable. The definitive example of choral artistry.A must have for every choral musician."
5,Clarion remote control,"This remote was pruchased on line and was deliverd in a timely manor.The remote is ""plug and play"",you simply mount the remote in your dash or other location.Connect the cable to the remote controller, and the stereo and you are ready to power it up.To make the light work, wire to your dash lights and chassis ground.The whole transaction was painless"
3,"Lovely to read, but fell short of expectations","I found this book very lyrical and inspiring, but it falls short of helping the beginning native plant gardener learn how to become a ""backyard restorationist"". The book is focused more on the author's personal gardening journey, which is lovely if you are looking for a travel-writing type of format, but I personally would have preferred more details and pictures about how an individual can recognize the native plants to her area, how to collect seeds (where legal), what plants naturally occur together (can we plant wildflowers at the feet of coyote bush and expect them to survive?) and plant lists."
3,Not enough,"I was dissapointed when I recieved this book in the mail. I was expecting a native gardening guide book, with perhaps some photos of native plants, descriptions of how natives can be used in the garden and such. Instead I recieved a book warning of the enormous dangers of planting exotic, non native species in one's back yard. The book is heart felt and well written. If you are not convinced that planting natives is the way to go, you will be after reading this book. Unfortunatly, you probably won't be much further along in knowing how or which or where."
3,como comunicarse con su angel de la guarda,"Desearía profundizar más sobre este tema, me apasiona pensar que podría haber algun tipo de comunicación con mi angel de la guarda. Aún no he leído el libro, me gustaría y si hay más información sera maravilloso! Le di tres estrellas porque de hecho lo buscaré para leerlo, vere entonces si llega a 5!"
5,different is good,"You ever watch headbangers ball and loose track of which band is which? A lot of these modern bands sound the same, but this video struck me as different. For one, the band didn't swipe around with their guitars, acting all pretentious. Then I bought the cd and was blown away. For 2006, this is the best metal I've heard so far. It reminds me of how Helmet would sound if they were depressed and into death metal. Vocals are awesome."
4,Dear Mommy is no Mommie Dearest,"Nikki Rach writes a true, funny, and touching stroy about her live as a wife and mother. It reflects upon her Christian influences as well as the strong relationship she has with her husband Dennis ~ who has written a companion book. I am buying this book for all my friends who are moms."
2,"""raw"" as in, no post-production work done to this DVD","If you're a fan of shoddy production, poor sound, and two hosts that are so annoying they are practically ASKING to be strangled to death, then have I got a DVD for you! This DVD really doesn't offer much, save for a few rehearsal performances of some of Chicago's music, including a delightful revamped version of ""Another Rainy Day In New York City"". Each band member gets interviewed; not particularly insightful. Also included is some random an ultimately useless footage of the band backstage and preparing to receive a star on the Walk of Fame (wow!). And if that isn't enough, there is some video of Chicago performing live. Sadly, this DVD could have been considerably better if the production rate was upped a few notches. Otherwise what you have here is a pretty unnecessary DVD that only the die-hard Chicago fans would get anything out of...and that's pushing it."
1,"Horrible, Uninformative and Poor quality","Ok I'll agree, the IDEA for this project was awesome, but it should have been left up to someone who knew something about interviews and music. The interviewer/host of this was this ditsy woman who got on my nerves within the first couple minutes. The quality of the video was horrible. There was nothing professional about this DVD, anyone off the street could do just as good a job as these people if they were given the opportunity. It is true there is more than one camera used in the filming, 2 to be exact, but the 2nd camera is a CAMCORDER, and it is very obvious when they switch over to it. I enjoyed the songs and the concert footage, but it was hard to auctally come away from this with any quality information about a GREAT band."
2,"fantastic concept, horrific execution!","the real artists working concept is terrific -- going behind the scenes as a band prepares for a concert tour. but the execution? there were better production values on ""beverly hills 90210's"" high school video yearbook! this is simply DREADFUL. both male and female hosts are intrusive and detract rather than enhance the proceedings. when i'm allowed behind the scenes with my favorite band, i don't need no-name ""hosts"" with extremely limited interviewing skills front and center camera, obscuring the views of the band that i've paid to watch.if you're a diehard chicago fan, give this a look. if you're easily annoyed by local cable access programming, you might want to pass this one up!"
1,Don't these guys have ANY pride ?,"As a teenager, Chicago was my favourite band, so I was pretty excited to view this video to see what these guys were working on now! The answer would appear to be - NOTHING AT ALL! Hey, fair enough, if they want to play the same songs for 30 years, and people still pay to hear them, why not ? BUT, why allow themselves to be filmed pretending to try to remember and ""arrange"" songs they've played thousands of times before, as if they were some great new material ? And why allow interviews to be released consisting of moronic questions asked by 2 of the most brainless interviewers I have ever seen, and answers of less than zero interest to anyone, unless you are a 3 year old who has never seen an instrument before...The whole thing was appalling, and my conclusion is, these guys have NO pride..."
4,Worth the Wait for a True Chicago Fan,"This DVD is certainly aimed at hard-core Chicago fans. I've read a couple of the other reviews and yes, it's true, the female interviewer is not very professional and the sound isn't that great during the rehearsal segments. But it's a REHEARSAL! A true Chicago fan will look beyond that to see, even after all these years, how hard work pays off. I like the way they ask band members about starting out as musicians; there is some educational value for young musicians in some of their responses. The concert portion of the DVD is outstanding, and I hope this great band follows this DVD up with a full length concert DVD. All you true Chicago fans out there, don't over analyze this, just enjoy it!"
2,Content Excellent Execution Needs Extreme Improvement,The band Chicago needs little words to explain why they are such a great band. However the interviewers in this felt it extrememly important that they suck up every little bit of time they had to hear the rehearsal with nonsense and garbage. The audio level and quality was horrible. I could have dealt with the video quality but the sounds is if it were recorded using a string and a dixie cup. Needs some mixing work.
3,A Chip in the merchandise,"The Movie is Brilliant, that is why I ordered it. however, one of the clamps that holds the book (liner notes) in the case, had chipped off durring the transfer. It is kind of annoying, but the movie is perfect, along with the special features, etc..."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CD,"doc holliday is almost as bad as bombay. i was totally disapointed by that cd, but being a hardcore blackmarket fan, i had to buy doc new cd just to be sure i wasnt missing another 'set triipin blocstyle' (which btw, is one of the best cds ever recorded imho). but again i was totally disappointed. so unfortuatly i have to say please please please do me a huge favor and DONT waste your money on this cd. insted, i want you to go buy Mr. Doctors 'Set Trippin Blockstyle' you will thank me."
4,Get this,"BR>Bangin from start to finish, definitely a differentstyle than the first two CDs, but if you're rollinsactown style then you should get into this no matterwhat. Streetwise, Murder mo murder, and many moreare just smashin."
2,"Great collar, good price, wrong item.","Good collar - is the standard martingale NOT the martingale with the buckle that is pictured. I returned this item for the correct item and again received one without a buckle. Regardless, it's a good price for the plain martingale."
1,WAY Too small,"This back pack is WAY too small. Contrary to the description, it does NOT hold any child's work from school. My son is 3 and it wouldn't hold ANYTHING he brought home from preschool. Do not waste your money. In addition, the toy company I purchased from has a lousy return policy, so make sure you read them before you purchase."
1,Not very flexible. OK if you just accept all the defaults.,"I really dislike this software. I'm the type that likes to customize everything and this program just is not made that way. First, when you initially select files and folders, your disk choices are ""C:"" or ""ALL"". I have several disks and I want to pick and choose, but this program makes that really difficult. Then you have to pick a destination where the files will be backed up. Choose carefully, because you won't be allowed to change it later! And if you want to do incremental backups, be sure to schedule it before you do the initial save, because you can't do it later. Basically the entire job, future backups and all, must be defined completly at the beginning and can never be changed without completely starting over."
5,Finding your soul amongst the break,"One of great surf movies of all time. As per the movie, surfing is a very selfish sport...but when you give something back, the waves seem all that much better. Rob really gave back and we all benefit. + Indo is an amazing place and, except for the taxi happy ending buger picking scene, he does the place justice."
1,Artistic but boring! I rather watch paint dry,"Cool idea, but come on. I can have a camera follow me around and surf a little bit here and there. I don't think anyone cares about the stuff between surfing and what ""you"" are really thinking.....lack of surfing and energy. I would not suggest this video, you have better things to do with yourself. Do a load of laundry instead and take a nap....what a waste of time!Not trying to be negative, but this video isn't cheap and it sucks balls."
5,crunch! chug! crunch! chug!,"Brutal death metal doesn't get any sicker or more brutal than Disgorge! This is slower tempo compared to Hate Eternal or Nile. But this album rules: sickest gutteral vocals, crunchiest guitars, lots of time changes making for interesting song structures, check it out!"
2,It is good for the size,"For its size it is kind of good but the blade part for the knife was to dull, and it's to small to really help it's better than nothing, though."
4,Long shipping,"This product did take about a month to receive. It is a cool tool to have in your wallet. Now for the tool itself. The ""knife"" blade is extremely dull to the point that it won't cut you if you tried. Second the saw blade would not work very well because it is so dull. Over all the tool is what I expected for the price but like I said it is a cool tool to have."
1,Pretty cheap,I guess I shouldn't expect much for $2 but this this is really cheap. I'm glad someone posted a picture of the english instruction card because mine only came with a paper of chinese symbols.
1,cheap garbage,I ordered 7 of these as cheap xmas gifts for people i work with. Got them a month later from China. All of them were horrible. The instructions were in Chinese. None of the edges were cleaned up. All of the wrenches had rounded edges and you could see where the steel was punched as a template where it was to be ground away. I have seen these types of tools before and these were horrible unfinished knockoffs.
4,"not a bad tool, for the price","This is not a solve all tool, but it can still come in handy when you dont have anything else or if you need an extra tool. my wife carries it all the time and i'm looking at getting another for myself. made out of good, tough steel, you really cant beat the price."
1,nothing yet,have not recieved this item yet was set to recieve 9-7-2012 who wouldve thunk it takes a month to recieve a simple item
2,Not a fan,"I bought two of these to keep in my wallet and my uniform front pocket. When I got them I was pretty disappointed. It's too bulky to keep in my wallet, the lanyard/key-ring hole is too small, knife edge is dull, screwdriver is too thick for most screw slots, and the saw might be able to cut a few twigs but nothing thicker than that.That being said; it's cheap enough, they don't charge for shipping, and it's better than nothing. At the very least you'll always have a bottle opener on you."
2,Still looking!,I'm still looking to find a use for this. I don't know what I expected when I bought this originally but it does not make a good screwdriver the knife is not in a handy spot nor is the saw.
5,Awesome little gadget!,What an awesome little toy! I haven't used it much so I can't vouch for its longevity but it sure does the trick! A little worried before I got it how it might hold up in a leather wallet but it comes in a nice little carrying case and goes right inside the wallet. Haven't tried to go through airport security with it yet but I think it might actually be ok!
1,Terrible,"This product is terrible, first off how is use #1 and #5 both bottle opener? I actually recieved this from a friend and i wondered how i could use this in a practive everyday seeting and I have yet to find it. I have now throw it out since i no longer want it to even take up space in my wallet. Please do not waste your money on something you will not use. I recommend the swiss-tech utilikey to everyone. It is a much better product and is not made of crap metal like this POS. Also, I have dis-owned the person who gave me this awful piece of crap. Good luck to any who still buy this, you have been warned."
4,Need label on tool,"Wish the label could be on the tool, even in small letters. Have already lost the paper diagram. However,this is the best tool and I have taken it with me on airplanes without incident. It has come in handy to open a bottle, cut some twine and measure a hem. It is always in my purse and I have another one in my briefcase."
3,A gift,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. I bought him a wallet and got this to put in the wallet. It seems really useful, but I never personally used it so I can only give it 3 stars. I couldn't imagine how it could have a blade on it, but it does and seems nice."
5,5 stars for this small multifunction tool,"I was pleasantly surprise by the number of common tools this small piece of metal holds. I just got this so I have not yet tested it's functions. I think that this will all work out as long as one does not expect this to function as well as the indivdual tools that it tries to represent. I think that if one happens to use this in a semi-emergency, or in an emergency situation where there are no other choices for a needed tool, this little guy could come out a hero. Price is very good."
5,Great,"My uncle loved this! He is very into camping and likes having neat gadgets like this! Plus, got an awesome deal on it!!!!"
3,Is thicker than I had expected,"For a device to be carried in my wallet, I would have wanted it to be thinner. No complaints for the price, though."
4,Why not?,"The chances that this will be the first thing one goes to when the problems that this solves arise are negligible, but having this and not needing it is better than needing it and not having it. It is truly compact, can be stashed ANYWHERE and will prove its 3 dollar worth the first time you are starving and gnawing your teeth into or trying to bang open the last can of beans during Zombie Apocalypse. Buy them in quantities of 10 and throw them everywhere you possibly think you might need to screw, open, slice, saw, leverage, measure and crudely navigate."
3,interesting little tool,"I just bought it.It's a solid little tool - it will fit in your wallet, but it's not super thin.I decided that i would only carry it when i think i need it - not by default.Some of the tools are not obvious - you really need to understand what/how each of the parts on the tool work.Keeping the instructions should be useful.I honestly think the bottle top opener is the most helpful.This might be a good box opener.Enjoy."
3,It's cheap.,"There are a couple of ""tools"" built into this thing that could prove useful someday. I hope I have it with me when that happens."
5,Credit Card Survival tool,This was a gift for my son. My husband was a bit miffed that he didn't get one too. I may have to do just that for his birthday. We were all fascinated with all the potential uses for this little card size tool. I don't think it will pass through airport security though.
5,Insanely well designed,"I've carried one of these with me everywhere I go for a number of years. Because it's so compact, I don't even think about it. The blade and bottle opener get quite a bit of use, but the screwdriver and can opener occasionally come in handy. The other things rarely get used, but hey, so what?These things are cheap, so I carry one even when I fly. The vast majority of the time, there is no issue, but once in awhile (like today) TSA takes it away from me. No problem -- I just ordered 5 more.I don't know why some people don't like this tool unless they actually expect a tiny piece of stamped metal to function like real tools that are much larger. I personally think the design is genius and that it's incredibly useful."
3,came in original case,"besides seemingly coming in original case from manufacturer, it also looked similar to the one on picture.although the above was observed, it really was not looked to be machined like the original, especially when looking at the detail of the center hole feature & the smallest enclosed corner one; where the edges were not distinct, & looked blurred, therefore diminishing overall tool feature.the price, though, lowers the complaint level.God bless you all,"
3,Stocking stuffer for the masses,Oh the people I stuff stockings for are diverse but they all have one thing in common: they could use tools to make themselves a bit more self-reliant. :)
5,It is what is says it is,"For the price what are you expecting? It's not going to be your go to daily tool. It's just something you're going to toss in a bag or your glove box/kitchen junk drawer and it'll be there if/when you need a blade or saw or something. It'll fit in your wallet, but it'll weigh it down. The wrenches seem useless as the smallest nut I could find in my house was on my bike and the wrench didn't fit it. Who knows? I got it more for the gadget appeal than it's potential usefulness. For the price it was a no brainer. Maybe someday it'll come in handy.Shipping was horribly slow (Although they do tell you that up front). It took almost a month to get here. I had honestly forgotten I had ordered it so it was a nice little surprise at the mailbox one day."
3,meh,decent product but you'll probably rarely use it. most of the 11 tools are difficult or hard to use. Good for the price.
4,"Thicker than you would think, Relatively Good Quality","Pros - Good, cheap, and has many functionsCons - Blade is useless, as are many of the other things, directions in ChineseNot sure if being think will be a pro or con, we'll see how it holds up"
2,Cheap,"I got what I paid for. This thing is cheap in cost, and cheaply made. The knife edge was dull on arrival, and it is not worth my effort to try to sharpen it. The nut sizes it can drive are all fairly small, which limits its usefulness in emergencies where such a tool would be required.I have not tried to actually use it yet, but if I ever do I will update my review."
1,Looks better then it is,Shipping took way too long from overseas. the product itself is very generic and not the same precision instrument that is in the picture. The tool is really un-refined and worthless.
1,"Poorly made, inaccurately stamped","I ordered two. Even for the very low price, they are not worth it - not one of the wrenching sockets is cut accurately enough to work. One of the units I bought has a gentle slope rather than the stairstep graduation. Maybe it's good for a saw for twigs? I admit, I have not tried the bottle opener. The can opener is rather dull due to being stamped, and is thus not likely to work (I am not going to try it, it looks that dull).Summary: Worthless."
2,just ok,Fits in my alumi-wallet and has ok tools in case. But wouldn't rely on it for serious emergencies. Fun gift but just a trinket.
3,English please,Would have been nice if this gizmo would have arrived in time for Christmas stockings. Finally came today - and to my dismay all the instructions for the various tools were in Japanese! - or Chinese! Not really sure. Had to go back to the actual description of the product to see what it could do. Seems fairly sturdy - time will tell how it will hold up.
2,Not of good quality.,Neat little novelty item but basically just a bottle opener. Also this came from Hong Kong had the custom stamp and all on it. Took approx:a month to get here. I would not recommend thids item.
2,Cheap,"Poorly crafted and useless. Not thin enough to keep in an average wallet, significantly heavy. Uneven machining makes this look like it was made by hand using a file to shape the edges. The serrated edge would probably work since it seems sharp. The bottle opener will probably work well for a while also. Spend more if you want something similar and get a known product that you can count on. It gets 2 stars for arriving pretty quickly and not being falsely advertised."
4,It is what it is.,While this is no Swiss Army Knife it does give you some simple and basic tools to have on you if a problem arises. I carry mine in my billfold as a back up to my Wenger Ranger 61 knife. In our modern world where even the smallest of swiss army knife would be called Weapon. This sits in a billfold out of site and out of mine and most companies that use metal detectors the security personnel don't bat an eye at this tool. This may not be the best tool but it is better than no tool if you can not carry a multitool on you during your daily task. The tool it's self is made of one piece steel and it is not going to break. The pouch it comes in is cheap and will fall apart after some time carrying. But for the price you can not ask for much more. I feel this tool has its place in the EDC(every day carry) for the urban dweller.
4,great item!,i swear i have reviewed this before but for money it a great little gadget it wont really do very much but u have a sharp edge in ur wallet if u need to open a box or something
3,Ok for the money,"This tool has the potential to be handy in a pinch. Both the serrated/saw and the straight knife edges are nice and sharp. The rest of the tools seem to be decent. The only one I've had to use so far is the bottle opener, and it works well! It also fits well in your wallet as a back-up for when you don't have your multi-tool on you. I think for the price, it's well worth it to include in your wallet/briefcase/computer bag/whatever just in case. The steel tools work much better than your fingernails and teeth!"
4,Cool Little Tool,"I bought about 8 of these for friends and family members. At around 3 bucks, its a great stocking stuffer or fun to stick in a birthday card. The tool is durable enough to do what it advertises. The only thing that kept it from getting 5 stars is the sleeve that it ships with for storage. They don't hold up to rough handling, and I wouldn't carry this thing in my pocket exposed. For now, it occupies a slot in my wallet."
4,Watch Out,"A great idea. I have yet been able to use it but I keep it in my wallet just in case. You may want to be careful taking it in and out of the protective sleeve because both of the long ends have cutting edges on them. I received a different type of keyring multitool a few years ago as a gift and carry it on my keys all the time. It has come in handy on multiple occasions, and I'm sure this one will as well. Between the two of these, I nearly have a full toolbox."
5,A great tool for every wallet!,"These things are great! The build quality of them isn't top notch, but for just a few dollars, you can easily get your money's worth from it very quickly! Almost every tool on here can help with little hassles almost daily. In fact, i think the only part I've never used is the compass, except for when i was trying to draw a circle that was actually round. This is a great tool to keep in a glove box, survival kit, and in your wallet. I never thought I'd use this nearly as much as I do. at the office, makes pulling paper clips a cinch, or cutting paper and boxes easy, got a loose nut on your desk, no worries, this has you covered."
5,Can't go wrong for under two dollars......,"Received mine today. It takes a while to get here but they tell you that form the get go & since it's coming from Hong Kong with free shipping it's understandable.It's a little smaller & thicker then a credit card as one reviewer said & seems to be stamped out of a piece of stainless steel.The diagram that comes with it is numbered but the functions that correspond to the numbers are in Chinese, not that it's that difficult to figure out. The pouch it comes with makes it easy to slip it into your wallet.For $1.32.....you can't go wrong."
2,Not much better then your finger nail,"Ok I guess if you only had your finger nails as a survival tool this could help a bit. Otherwise, junk. Save your 2 dollars or what ever it cost."
1,Credit card knife,Have not received the item yet. Still waiting for the item to come to me. ThIs is the second time I have order the item. The item is cheap in cost. So I thought well I will just order it again
1,Credit card size????,This product was not what it was represented to be. I would not recommend that you buy it. The product is too small to be of any use. It is poorly made.
2,SUCKS,the picture looks like the cut outs of the metal are nice crisp cut outs But the one i got looks dull and looks like its aBout 50 years old. the cut outs look like they have Been used heavily. the one i recieved is really poor quality. i would have given it 1 star But since i only paid aBout a dollar it wasnt much of a loss. definately dissapointed in this item.
2,Indepth review,"I have tried many wallet multi-tools out there, and this one isnt anything to write home about. The saw blade is where your grip should be, so you cant grip it tight, its a lot smaller than you think and that makes it very hard to handle. I do like the one piece design concept but this wasnt designed well for any sort of actual use. Its not sharp enough to do anything, and the case it comes with ripped in the first 2 days of use. If you want a wallet multi-tool you'll use get a swisscard lite."
2,Junk,"While an interesting idea, its all but useless. Pass on it. Buy a proper multi-tool. Buy many multitools. Find what works, keep redundant back up systems, but don't fool yourself by thinking you could survive with this. Then again, it was like .99 cents. I suppose you could throw it at a threat."
3,Credit Card Survival Tool - Not TSA Approved,"This item is as it is described and arrives very quickly. The nice thing about it is also the problem. It is so thin that I tucked it into a credit card pouch where it traveled with me for thousands of miles through TSA scanners and beyond -- that is until last weekend when it was confiscated by a TSA agent in Medford, Oregon because of the sharp edge. If you purchase this item, just keep in mind that you may lose it at the airport."
2,meh,"Not a loss for the money spent, but it's a piece. The die must have worn out about a year before mine were stamped. The wrench openings are essentially useless. Not stair-stepped as in the picture, just a wavy line that would serve little function. I suppose as long as the bottle opener works, I'll be ok with it.One is none, two is one, three is prepared. I'd say make this your fourth or fifth."
4,Neat Tool,"Compact little tool that has everything you need. Didn't know what to expect when I bought it but I gave this as a gift, then came back and bought one for myself."
1,Cheap,"Barely worth the material it's made of! I would not recommend this to anyone. The polish finish was poorly done, material was removed causing rounded edges that should have been square."
3,Might want to get a sharpener too,"This card does most of what it's supposed to do just fine. The bottle opener, screwdriver, saw, and can openers are all super useful. The wrench slots and knife on the other hand aren't the greatest. The knife edge is very dull, and when using the smaller wrench slots it's very easy for the bolt/nut to slip into the larger slots. obviously any sort of use that requires turning (screwdriver, wrench) is awkward as well, seeing as the card doesn't have a handle.All things above considering, this is still a handy little thing to have for the price, but it really thickens the wallet so mine mostly stays in the desk drawer."
5,clever little multi tool,this is a great little multi tool i was surprised how often i use it and the blade at the top actually has a pretty sharp edge definitely worth it for this price
5,surknife,Item was just as described and I would purchase from this person again and the service was fast coming from California good service
4,"These are great, The price has increased though","These are great. I purchased this from Amazon about 5 months ago when I had to replace my old one (accidentally forgot it in my wallet when I went to the airport). Fortunately when I purchased it, it was only $1.50. I see the price has now gone up to $4.50. That is unfortunate that the price went up, but in all honest I would probably have no problem paying that if I had not gotten use to the cheaper price."
3,An addition to your credit card wallet,"A multi function tool to have for covert back-up, for any ""just in case"" scenario. Better to have it & not need it, than to need it & not have it. Preforms a number of useful tasks as well as a blade edge for any instance that might require you to have to defend yourself."
5,Claudia and Mean Janine,The reason I put this book for five stars is becuase it really is interesting.The part where Mimi has a stroke really scared me because I was worried about Claudia loosing Mimi because I know what it is like to loose someone very close to you.So I really was worried but when the doctors said that Mimi was going to be okay I was so happy.But I really liked the part in this book when Claudia and Janine were being nice to each other.It kinda sounds like my sister and I.I really enjoyed this book even tho some of this book they spoke Japanese I still liked it.Oh!One more thing I don't like this book..........I LOVE it.I really enjoyed this book and I hope you will too.
1,Not a good book while others may like it.,In this book 7 claudia and Janie fight a lot. In book 26 claud has to say good bye. I hate or not like too well because I don't like Janie. If you want fighting with words youd like this book.NOT ALL BSC BOOKS RULEZ
3,alright book,"I found it sad because of mimi having the stroke. Claudia and Janine not getting along cause of differences is common with many siblings at times, janine is portrayed as a genius who studies all the time and claudia as a social butterfly who's into clothes and makeup but the end shows that they can still get along through their differences."
3,claudia and mean janine,claudia kishi who's already turn thirteen because it's alreadlyjuly her sister and her was fighting so much that her grandmother had a storke this is a very good book you read shouldit!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Not a Scientific book,"I do think if I get bored enough to read the whole book I will get to all the factsI do not (or hardly do) read Fiction, I am a scientific mind interested in alternate science and that is the reason I bought the book.I am really not interested in the author's beef with the scientific community, nor in world politics, nor conspiracy theories, nor the life stories of some forgotten scientist - only scienceI do accept that you will always find some personal garbage in a book, It was after all written by a human, but when that ratio is 98% waffle and 2% fact then it gets a bit muchI read the first few chapters, then skipped a bit forward, a few more pages, skipped a handful of pages, read a few more pages, had a look at some of the pictures in the back, read the index again to see if I could find the invention that was supposed to be in there, got irritated and put the book downI am not saying it is a bad book, I am only saying it contains very little on Alternative Science"
3,The symbiotic relationship of the writer to his material.,"While this author has obviously researched this book emphatically, his personal closeness to the subject has left holes in the text that make the read a bumpy ride. Too much is assumed of the reader when historical fact is alluded to instead of described. I had hoped for a kind of insight into the history that still left me titillated but instead felt like I was in the surgery room of the local hospital. Some of the detail veered off the beaten path and made for a somewhat dry read."
3,Not Good as a Text,"If you're taking a course in ODEs and your primary text doesn't have some kind of Mathematica supplement, then this book might help you learn to solve differential equations with Mathematica.However, this book most emphatically is *NOT* a good place to learn diffy Q's if you're a novice or you don't have some other source of instruction. The author tends to dance around from topic to topic a bit much; she frequently presents the ""condensed"" version of definitions or proofs; and she has a tendency to drop very advanced notions (e.g. nonlinear equations) into the middle of simple discussions without warning. Much of the time, she seems to be assuming that her audience already knows the subject matter, so she can just give a quick sketch of some topic.This book really doesn't provide enough value to justify its high price."
5,A very useful book,"Abell and Braselton strike a nice balance between the analytical solution of differential equations by hand, and numerical solution by computer. Mathematica is used to simplify some of the details, but they teach how to do everything by hand, including programming runge-kutta solution methods, fourier series, and other topics that lazier authors might have skipped over.Every chapter starts with basic definitions and builds to useful solution techniques. The book is packed with fully worked examples. My edition is a few years old and talks about the ""newly released"" Mathematica 3.0, but everything applies just as well to version 4.2."
3,barely adequate as introduction,"I am using this book to brush up on the subject. In Chap 2, for instance, I have found a couple of places were the examples using Mathematica and those worked out on paper do not follow each other. Errors generated are shown for some Mathematica examples but not others.Heavily dependent on using Mathematica to do the legwork, coverage of the basics is sparse.Not a book for people just starting out learning Differential Equations. I would have rated this book lower if I was depending on it as a textbook or tutorial."
3,Good reference book,"A good, short introductory reference book for those interested in exploring and understanding the basic belief system and history behind Celtic mythological tales (The Mabinogion, the Fianna, et al)."
1,Total rip off - but my class required the book,"At $65.00 used for this book, it is a total rip off. The book is a paperback with 190 pages of actual study material. The contents is fundamental and could have been reduced to 100 pages for a total cost of $15.00 . This is what's happening in the education system, students are being required to buy books that are sub-standard, and pay huge amounts of money for them because the publishers lobby the institutions to select their books."
3,The Interest Group Society,This book explains how organizations attempt to influence the political system. There has been a large increase in the number of interest groups in the past three decades. The book explains the types of interest groups and why people join them. It gives a good explanation of lobbyist and the role they play in the political spectrum.
3,Poor handling of the merchandise during shipping,The music was so-so... not great fidelity. Maybe it was my ears. But the package arrived in poor condition with the CD container smashed and completely useless. It's a wonder that the CD survived.Red Dawg
5,A Must-Have for the Phenomenologist,"This excellent introduction to collider physics serves as a necessary reference for collider physics calculations. It describes and includes numerous Standard Model calculations from the phenomenologist's perspective, which are essential starting points for generalizing the calculations to new physics. Ellis et al. have a good complementary text,QCD and Collider Physics (Cambridge Monographs on Particle Physics, Nuclear Physics and Cosmology)."
2,Disappointed,I ordered this but never did arrive. I did get full reimbursement but was never informed as to why it never arrived nor did I receive another shipment. I was disappointed in that as it was a gift.
4,quality shipping,"These are wrapped up tight with foam and plastic. I ordered eight of them for my basement mood lighting and they are perfect. Only drawback is they use small base chandalier 60W bulbs and I would like more light, but that's not a big deal."
3,Advice: an alternative to buying this DVD,"I have not seen the DVD hence the neutral 3 star rating. However $29.95 is a lot for 30 minutes, especially considering the reviews by others who have seen it. It is clear that no one learns, or should learn paragliding from a DVD. However if you really want to see instructional footage on a DVD my advice would be to buy the comprehensive, and perhaps definitive book ""Paragliding: A Pilot's Training Manual"" which includes an 80 minute DVD illustrating all of the critical paragliding techniques (but again is no substitute for instruction). This book is available from Amazon for $39.95 and if out of stock or on a extended delivery schedule you can find it at the USHGA store, and from several other paragliding and hang gliding organizations."
1,Short & Shallow,"Very Short & Shallow video, not a real starting paragliding video, just some good flying videos, safe money & don't buy, tones of those videos are free on youtube!"
1,Not really worth it!,"Get yourself a flight simulator, you may learn more than what you get from this DVD"
1,Really a waste of time and money,"Luckily not money for me as I was lucky enough to see it before deciding to purchase. The title is very misleading. Absolutely no explanation whatsoever as to what a paraglider is or the parts that make it up. So when he's talking about A risers.....""What the hell are those"".The video starts off with students that are already on their 4th day of training.....come on. 10min in and you're watching an advanced pilots section (Big ears. I only kinda knew what this was because I read it in a book), about 20min in you're doing tandem flights. Some short (2min) sections of instruction (limited) linked together by clips with guitar music.That's all folks!!!Don't bother, rather by a book at least it explains and shows you the basics all the way to the more advanced subjects."
4,Terrific Richter set,"The Schumann ""Symphonic Etudes"" are a trifle heavy-handed but with some beautiful moments. The Haydn sonata is delightful, and the Beethoven selections tremendous. But I'm writing this review because this set must be snapped up for the Rachmaninov preludes. This is some of the most ravishing piano playing I've heard in a long time, op. 23,#4, in particular. The sounds is quite good, and captures well Richter's enormous dynamic range. Buy with confidence!"
2,I haven't even listened to all the songs yet.,"This was my second tape in my life, and I put it on while I tried to fall asleep. I fell asleep before I'd listened to four songs. The next morning I changed tapes. I have never heard all the songs on the album. To me, that means it wasn't worth my money."
1,ha ha ha ha ha HA!!,"the only song that really had an impact on me was the absolutely stunning ""falling into you"". wow!! what a brilliant piece of work that is. the way she mixes traditional japanese melodies with the pounding tribal rythms just sent me to heaven!!??? this woman is a master of the didgeridoo, why doesn't the world wake up and recognise this?? if i had one word to sum up this album i'd half to pick SCUMMY. but before i end this i'd also like to point out that the polyrythmic solo between Sergio and Yashimoto from the Siberian Canto Ensemble was quite devastating! and how about that second solo with the violins crashing to an orgasmic halt. don't even think, cash your paycheck and buy a copy for all your friends immediately!"
1,ugh..!!,"celine's album ""falling into you"" is not good.all you hear is that lady sceaming at the top of her lungs with every song.and all the songs are sooooo long...""it's all coming back to me now"" is like 7 mintues!!.that song is about her forgeting everything.i would not pick this up.no!!!"
1,un feeling love songs!,"thats all she can do, love songs and nothing else, maybe she can only do that nothing else..."
5,FANTASTIC _POWERFUL_TREMENDOUS EFFORT,"If you don't already own this C.D. you must get it. It's really a wonderful album. It's full of energy and Dion's voice will move you every time you play it. I have had this c.d. for over a year and it still touches me deeply when I play it; especially ""All By Myself"". Producers: David Foster and others did a great job. Rene who manages (and does not produce) is a terrific manager for Celine, taking her career to new heights."
4,My first Dion experience--melodies are haunting/ unforgetabl,"from first to last, Dion's renditions on this cd are haunting and unforgetable. The melodies invade my dreams and certainly shall be joined by many more of her works. A must have for the romantic soul..."
3,"7 Words--""It's All Coming Back to Me Now""","THAT makes the whole CD, that one song... one of THE greatest songs EVER, ""It's All Coming Back to Me Now"". Apart from that song, about half of them are good and half of them aren't worth listening to. Again though, if for no other reason than ""It's All Coming Back to Me Now"", get this CD!"
4,A Pop Virtuoso,"I don't really like listening to Celine very much. I find the songs to be overproduced and generally too syrupy-sweet and melodramatic in lyrics and emotion for my taste. With that said, it may be a bit surprising that I feel that the Grammy award for this album was well deserved; and I feel this recording deserves four stars. Celine is one of the best pure singers in pop music today. Her voice has only gotten better with time and she is so distinctive in her phrasing that one cannot mistake her for anyone else."
5,Celine's number one album of all time!,"If you don't have this album yet go and get it! Songs like IACBTMN, BYLM, ABM, DOY, and ILY are all great soft loving songs that only Celine herself could do. Then there are songs that are great for dancing, like RDMH, MYH, and DOL. The best song on the album are SM, FIY, AND Fly. i can see why this album won a grammy for album of the year."
5,One of Her Best!,"I have literally listen to this CD over and over. There are so many hit songs on this CD. You won't go wrong with ""Falling into You."""
5,~yo céline did a great job :-)~,"What more has to be said? This album is terrific, the best song's are 'call the man, because you loved me, make you happy, i love you and i don't know' Buy this album,today!"
2,"Why oh why was ""Your Light"" left off the american edition","I am giving the 2 stars to the U.S. release because recently I had been to Canada and just happened to browse around in a CD store and came across Falling Into You. To my disappointment, there was an extra track on the canadian CD that wasn't on the one I bought back home in America called Your Light. It's a really good song and I don't know why it was left off the U.S. disc. Not only that, but that song was released worldwide"
4,"Love it, especially 'Seduces Me'",Get it for 'Seduces Me' alone and its worth it. Celines whiskey raspy voice gives me goosebumps every time I listen to it. Absolutely the most beautiful song.
5,I really love this CD! It's so wonderful!,"It was really amazing to hear this CD! It's Célines best CD! I love every track. My favorites: It's all coming back to me now, because you loved me, I love you, Dreamin' of you and call the man"
5,Excellent! Celine's best yet!,"Excellent CD! My favorite of all, so far. She is in top voice throughout. Love the diversity of the songs."
2,"Good,But There's Better","Sure,Celine Dion is a ""powerful"" singer,but some restraint is in order,their (she and her hubby/producer Rene's) ""more is better"" approach can be quite overbearing. Like their overblown wedding,but that's another story. Some consideration of simplicity and another,younger producer is in order. David Foster or Daniel Lanois,perhaps? Celine Dion,she's ""Canadian"" sure,but she's no Sarah Mclachlan,Margo Timmins or Lorena McKennit who really are moving,dreamy, feminine singers. A far better experience with those three."

2,"Not tasty...""Medium-Rare"" without any good sauce","I liked the former album, ""The colour of my love"", but this one is far worse in many ways. Just a couple of songs are worth paying attention and listening to. It's a shame this got a Grammy Award. Both arrangement and instrumentation for this album were not well-done but just ""medium-rare"", I think. In particular, I don't like most accompniments were done by using synthesizers, which must be, I believe, an easiest way to perform (and to save time and efforts). My impression from this album is that proper endeavours were not made by Celine and other people including recording engineers who made this one. To tell the truth, this album made me be afraid of buying her next albums. I really don't think that singing songs well with nice voice is not all to ""create"" a meaningful album.But I still am a fan of Celine. I love her beautiful and powerful voice. I just want her to be better in all elements forming music other than singing itself."
3,again,"This is okay! But, her voice is annoying when she screeches the notes to C. Celine, sing, dont scream."
5,Best Singer in the WORLD!,"Celine is the best singer that there is PERIOD! I used to think that Mariah Carey what the best singer...but Celine has her beat! The album ""All the Way"" is the best one yet...too bad she is going away for 2 years...and hopefully coming back! If you don't have any or all of her albums definatelly put it on your Christmas list!"
3,nice CD for fans,"None of the songs stand out to me,but it is a good CD for people who love Celines gifted voice."
5,"""It's All Coming Back To Me Now""","I perchased this album on August 22,2001 and i when i listened to it i was thrilled i got it, i can see why this album won the grammy award=) It is the best album Celine has released, i have 3 more celine cd's and one more shipping to my house soon=) but FIY beats all my other album's. Some of my fav songs are, ""Make You Happy"",""I Love You"",""Call The Man,""If That's What It Takes"",""Dreamin' Of You,and,""Fly""... I have lots of favourites songs:) Celine Dion is the best singer. I have ben a huge Celine fan since i was 10 years old, and now i'm 13 years old=) I will be 14 January 9. Well for those of you who don't have this album yet please get this cd now. It is worth every penny!Buy the best cd! K? Cya!"
5,An excellent artist with an excellent CD!,"Celine is the best, and this CD proves it. I love this CD so much!!!!!!!"
5,I recommend this c.d to people of all ages!,This C.D. really reaches out to u and has momentom that is amazing. It is powerful and astonishing. I suggest that everyone listen to this music at least once. I almost guarantee that u will want to buy this and also u will suggest it to others. Its definetly her best work.
3,Her most consistent album.,"Falling Into You by Celine Dion was a good album for its time but now this cd is pretty much throwaway pop. Songs I do appreciate include: Because You Loved Me, River Deep Mountain High, Call the Man, All By Myself, It's All Coming Back to me Now, and the title-track. The rest of the songs are filler. I used to be a fan of Celine's but after Let's Talk About Love album I lost interest, my music taste changed after that. Romantic album but nothing spectacular."
5,"The queen, Celine, sings beautifly! Excellent voice!","Celine, opens up her heart to listeners! She matches EVERY pitch and note with excellency, and experience. She is a great singer, and wonderful person. Her songs really touch your heart. And the way she sings them, oh, you can't get more beautiful than that. That is why I gave This album I 5 star rating!"
5,Sooo Cool!!,"You will never get sick of hearing this album! Celine Dion is like, the best! You should buy this, you won't be sorry."
5,Celine has never been better...she shines,"A brilliant album...Celine's voice is just so perfect. From the Jim Steinman epic ""It's all coming back to me now"" to the beautiful ""Fly"", Celine shines. A good mix of up-tempo songs and ballads...the title track is a lovely ballad, as is the Dan Hill penned ""Seduces Me"". My album though has 15 songs not 14. The one that is not listed here is ""Your Light"". Not a bad song, but not the best either. I will reserve that for ""Fly""...it sounds like a song a mother would sing to her deceased child. Celine's voice even trembles with emotion, she is practically in tears and you can hear it. So touching! If you like Celine, then this album should be in your collection."
5,Greatest - though not the newest,"I have been a huge fan of Celine's since 1994 and have many of her English CDs, as well as a few French CDs and overall I would say ""Falling Into You"" is the best. She would probably not think so, for I have heard her say in interviews that her best work is ""Let's Talk About Love""...also a great album, but I have friends who are not as big of fans as I and they still love the ""Falling Into You"" CD. IT'S THE BEST:-)"
4,21st century terrorism,"The story revolves around China's entry into the 21st century which China Dome - $21 Billion airport with 15 runways and the aircraft that will use this superport - next generation SST aircraft. Lovejoy obviously knows his aircraft and the detail makes this book believable.There are many people who would like to see China Dome fail, but which interest (greed, idiealism, madness) is sponsoring the terrorist who is attempting to shutdown China Dome? It is a good yarn, plausible, and if you think about the climatic sequence at the end, maybe human pilots should keep watch over all those expensive electronic gizmos."
5,Great disc!,"Some of these are the hard-to-find 12"" single versions, many of which were unavailable on CD before this. However some are also the standard single versions, so check the running times if there's something specific you're looking for."
5,Great 80's club set!!!,"Remember the 80's club scene? Well this set will take you back. The first song Young Gun's is a great first song and keeps you moving through out the set. As with the other Club Epic sets, there are great 12"" mixes of dance songs from DOA to Wham. This CD is well arranged and the sound quality is awesome. This is a must have CD if you collect 80's and if you don't -- start with this one."
3,"I love this film, but...","This is one of my favourite Hitchcock films, but the only gripe I have with this one is that the soundtrack is different to the one I was used to watching. I wish they had not changed it - I loved listening to pomp and circumstance and beethoven on the other soundtrack. Its hard to enjoy this one - its amazing what a soundtrack does for a film!"
3,It was good for its time,"The story was interesting, but the acting was bad. In silent films all one had to do was make exaggerated gestures. I expected something like ""Pandora's Box"" or ""Diary of a Lost Girl"" both with Louise Brooks. They had engrossing characters and stories, and superlative acting despite the lack of dialogue. Overall, it was interesting to see a silent film, but it's not worth the cost to buy this video. Please rent."
1,The lodger,I didn't relize this movie was silent. I fast forwarded through most of it. I could not believe people actualy enjoyed this movie. The reviews made the movie sound so good. I will think twice before I buy after reading other reviews. Thanks.
2,Mismatched colors,"I just received these, and while they were fine quality for the price, the colors of the two stones were completely different. Very obviously mismatched. But I dont know if I will return them, since they are so cheap. Might not be worth the cost of shipping."
5,Excellent and inspiring.,"I recommend this wonderful book for the inspiration it gives. The poetry is accessible and charming. The reproductions of woodcuts are beautiful. Anyone who would like to try writing Haikus as a meditation, or for fun will find that it starts to happen almost automatically."
4,Pretty good speaker wire,Works well for my application: mid and rear speakers in a small family room. The only problem was that the connectors did not mate with my receiver's speaker ports. My receiver has typical connections.
1,No-one Buy This,"I used to be a big Korn fan. This CD made me listen to other band, and eventually dislike Korn. I don't like one song on this CD. Jonathan Davis's voice is so bad here. Their debut was so much better! Why was this one so bad then? I don't know. But this is really, really bad Rap Metal. Do yourself a favour, and give this one a miss."
4,"5 stars...no, but definetly worthwhile","despite popular opinion, i bought this koRn cd before the other 2, and (smirk)ohmygod, i actually LIKED it! i wish i could somehow edit ""twist"" off though, it is so damn annoying..... other than that most of the songs are good...i like ""chi"" the best.... wicked is good to....koRn's version of lowrider is definetly worth buying the album for..... i wouldn't give it 5 stars though, what are you people, NUTS? 5 stars belongs for the Beatles or Jimi Hendrix... 4 stars belongs for Nine inch nails ""Pretty hate machine"".....This probably deserves 3 1/2.... just my opinion though."
3,KoRn On ThE KoB AnYoNe?,"i aM dEFINATELY a KoRn fOLLOWER, nO dOUBT aBOUT iT, bUT i wAS sADLY dISSAPOINTED wITH tHIS CD.

1,stinks,sold it to a second hand cd shop....but korn is good and follow the leader is absolutely great...hopefully their new one is good too...am waiting for it to be shipped
3,"Meh, better than expected.","When a friend of mine [who keeps babbling on endlessly about KoRn's god-like powers over our tiny little human brains] lent me this CD I put in my CD case thinking ""This ____ is going to be unspeakably bad"", yet I was pleasantly surprised that it is not actually a BAD record, it's an ok one for a numetal band. KoRn really doesn't write ""songs"", at least none that stand out, and they do not vary much, they also have very limited technical talent, and their lyrics are quite annoying and repetitive, BUT! there is one thing that saves this album, something which is possibly the ost important thing about music, and that is, it has a very distinctive and cool, very METAL sound which only KoRn can properly produce. It's a bleak and fuzzy grind, in which you can barely understand what Jon Davis is saying at all [which is a good thing], but actually sounds entretaining, at least for a while. Reccomended for fans of NuMetal, since KoRn is basically the only good band in the genre."
4,their second best,"I thought this was a wonderful cd. My favorite tracks are good god, adidas, and kill you. This is there second best CD. Unfortunately they sold out with their third release Life is Peachy. Only teany boper fans and people obsessed with videos and billboard think that Follow theLeader is their best Cd. Issues sucked too because they did not put enough time into the record. Buy this cd and their first cd. Korn has went south since here in order to attempt to compete with backsteet and britney. Oh well at least they cared about music for a few years."
2,Korn is boring,"After hearing about how great Korn is supposed to be and listening to a few of their songs on the radio, I decided I should try out one of their CDs. Let me just say that I am HIGHLY disappointed. ADIDAS was great and about 2 other tracks were OK at best.. the rest sucked though. The CD starts off with Twist which is so stupid. It's just a bunch of grunts! I don't know about all the other Korn albums but I advise anyone sane to stay away from this thing."
5,KORN RULES!!!!!,"This CD ROCKS!!! Everybody out there that is looking for a great band that can get you in the mood to jump up and down non-stop this is the one for you. I love the songs Twist, Good God, ADIDAS and Kill You. Anyway, the whole CD is great!"
3,I am a big Korn fan but Life is Peachy dissapointed me.,"After I heard Korn's first CD (Korn) I was addicted. I loved it. I couldn't wait for them to come out with another. When I first heard about Life is Peachy I bought it right away and was very dissapointed. I much prefer their first CD. Life is Peachy does have some song I like including ADIDAS, Lowrider, and Twist but all together I was dissapointed and expected more from this group on their second CD."
4,Pure metal,"Korn's second album is a fabulous work of music. The songs 'Lost', 'Swallow', 'Kill You', and all of the others (except maybe for 'Chi') are all well-written and well-thought out. Congratulations Korn!"
1,Seriously folks,"Okay, Korn is a genius of marketing. That's it. This album is terrible. Their first album had some decent qualities but was still pretty bad. Now they come out with a second album that has them continuing in the direction they were on the first album, and is very mindless and filled with pointless screaming and typical guitar, bass and drums. So, on their third album, the marketing people mold korn into what the kids want. And now korn is popular. Go figure."
4,Cool CD,"Songs like Twist, ADIDAS and No Place to Hide are great Korn classics. Kill You has a dark strange lyric base but the song in itself is cool. I think that this is a good buy for Korn fans who dont have it, or for regular fans of the alternative/rock genre."
5,Best and Most Original Band ever,"Korn is one of the innovators of metal along with sabbath and metallica, most original sound ever with the grinding and down tuned guitars and clicky bass.This album is probably korn's best cd they incoroprate so many sounds on here from heavy metal, funk and rap. JD is the best vocalist ever because he gives off a very moving energy when singing because of his f**ked up childhood. Just the best band ever. nobody can ever take the place of Korn"
5,Korn are well.........what is there to say,let me just start off by saying i started listning to korn when they relaesed there first album i wasnt very old and i didnt understand most of the lyrics but i though it was amazing and i still DO!!!!! This album is really cool and has a good flow to it...If you would like any lyrics too any korn songs please email me at willmason15@hotmail.com or if you want the song meanings email me too.
4,be my neighbour,"Half the time on this album, Korn is exercising their trash-talking porno-obsessed personas (tracks like ""K@?*!"" and ""Porno Creep,"" obviously), and the other half concerns Jon whining and suffering the effects of child abuse.Limp Bizkit is way off. Korn is the best New Metal band that is, the best that was, and the best that ever will be. Though there are some throwaway tracks (""Lowrider""?!), Korn made a good album.Too bad they're sucking now."
2,VERY dissapointed,"This album is a bunch of crap. The songs on it are a cross between funk and korns usual metal, which should not be allowed. The ONLY reason i gave this album 2 stars instead of 1 is because of korns take on lowrider. Funny stuff. Let me say, though, that their debut album is one of the greatest albums ever made, period."
4,Korn gets laid-back cool,"This album isn't as raw as their debut album. It's more ""polished"" in a word. It has a laid back gangster feel to it. By no means is it a ""sophmore jinx"" and unlike many other bands sophmore album, it's different than the first."
5,Good god!,I send some rewiews to amazon sayng korn is bad! But their not bad! That cd is one of the best rock/metal style i ever listened! Korn is one of the best bands of the millenium
2,The album had two good songs - ADIDAS and wicked,I liked Korn after listening to 'Fake' on the metal hammer free CD and I thought Korn were the business and so I bought the album'KORN-KORN' and it was brillant...but after buying 'Life is Peachy'...I did not like it apart from two songs which were ADIDAS and Wicked...the rest were crap..I was well disappointed with that album...so I am back to listening to Slayer's South of Heaven album and Metallica's Master of Puppet album.
4,Not as good as their first...,"I bought ""Life is Peachy"" the day it came out, and I must admit I was a little disappointed. I'm not saying it's not a great disc, because it is...it just doesn't touch their self-titled debut. As stupid as it sounds (this being Korn and all), this album was a little too muddy for my tastes (which is why I only gave it a 4 out of 5). If they'd have spent a little more time on post-production, it would have been a 5 out of 5.However, this IS a must have for a Korn fan. There are a few weak tracks (""Swallow"" and ""K@#*%!"" come to mind), but tracks like ""Good God"", ""Mr. Rogers"", and ""No Place to Hide"" more than make up for it. Head's rendition of ""Low Rider"" is classic, and I'm sure EVERYBODY has heard ""A.D.I.D.A.S."" by now (we tried to get that track played at our senior prom, but the fascist teachers wouldn't let us). If you're a true KoRn fan chances are you probably already own this album, if not, well...you know what to do."
1,Shipping Charges,i thought it was lame that i got charged for shipping and handling for two items from the same seller. And i beleive its extra lame when the seller obviously took advantage of the situation and sent the two items together in one cd case. Are you that hard up for two dollars?
1,Are the people with the label idiots?,"How could any self-respecting record label continue making albums for this band? After their embarrassing freshman release, I was sure they would evaporate. But, people are stupid and they'll buy this crap if you wave it around in their faces and nurture it on MTV. Pure crap. This band sucks and this album sucks! KORN sucks! A swift influenza outbreak to the band, for the love of GOD please!"
4,"great cd, but not my favorite","this cd kicks some major ...ive loved korn for years, and love all of their cds except for their first one....for some reason, i just couldn't connect with it. by the way, CHINO MORENO is the guy in Wicked. Chino Moreno is up there with Jon Davis as one of my favorite metal singers, and i like that song because both are in it!"
3,The downfall begins....,"Korn's self titled album was good, and their follow up is about half decent, if not somewhat repetitive. Pros of ""Life is Peachy"" is that the riffs are more melodic than on the self titled album, but once again Jon Davis' life sucks lyrics really bring the album down a lot. I give it 3 stars because this was before Korn went corporate."
3,"Good CD, Not Great.","Don't get me wrong here, I love Korn. I think they're a totally awesome group. I just thought this CD could have been better. It still is pretty cool with some awesome songs like Adidas, Nowhere to Hide (which both sound a lot alike), and it has the generall korn sound with the rest of the CD. They just lacked better tracks. I still think the CD is okay and that's why I have kept my copy of it, I just think that their other albums are much better."
3,could be better,"I feel that this album is not their best yet. the right purchase would be the self-intilted album, it is some real korn!"
5,This is proper KOrn,"I have to say, i'm not quite sure what all you people out there are complaining about. Life is Peachy is a brilliant display of talent, passion and aggression. The opening track ""Twist"" say's it all. Song's like ""Swallow"", ""Porno Creep"" and my favourite Korn song ""Kill You"", are by far the most advanced Korn songs around. Each song has meaning and has a start and a finish, unlike Follow the Leader."
2,KoRn Doesn't Even Like This Album!!!,"I will admit that I own it because being a loyal fan of their first album I went out and bought it. However, KoRn themselves have gone on record saying they wish they had not been rushed into making this album. They barely even acknowledge this album anymore.Notice what track Follow The Leader starts on and you'll realize what I'm saying."
2,the worst korn cd,"this is the worst korn cd ever.The production is terrible,there are only 2 good songs which are good god and a.d.i.d.a.s. I recomend buying the self titled debut album instead."
2,mabye with a little work,Life is peachy seems like it could have been a good album if Korn had devided to work on the album some more. Songs like Chi and Twist could have been good with some extra work. Low-Riders and ADIDAS are pretty funny but the album could have been alot better.
1,What the hell is this?,It's a cd with nothing more than mindless screaming. Half the lyrics to the songs are just grumbles and growles. Theres hardly any actually words. I borrowed this from a friend and couldn't wait to give it back to him. It's painfully bad.
2,Rushed,"If it weren't for Jon having a nervous breakdown in the middle of making Peachy maybe it wouldn't have sounded so rushed. As it stands, it's short, boring, not particularly well made and with only No Place to Hide, A.D.I.D.A.S and Good God to recommend it. GET FOLLOW THE LEADER!"
2,Almost unlistenable,"I am a big Korn fan, but I'll be damned if this isn't a hard album to like. Sure there's a few good songs like ADIDAS and Nowhere to Hide, but most of it has nothing to keep coming back to. Every so often I'll break it out and listen to it in hopes of finding something to get my juices flowing, but alas, my time is spent in vain. If you're not a huge Korn fan you can safely skip this one and go with the other 3, including the new one ""Issues"" which is excellent."
5,This CD is so awsome. The best song is A.D.I.D.A.S.,I think you should definetly by this cd. The awesomest song is Wicked. BY the cd
3,Twist and go,"Life is Peachy disappointed me after a couple songs. I think Twist is great along with Chi, and I also like Mr. Rogers, but the rest of the album is just not up to par for Korn. I usually just throw the CD in to hear Twist and then I go onto another CD."
3,Die Hard Korn fans buy this,"You have to really love Korn in order to like this Cd. It doesn't meet up to the expectations set by their first and third albums that it is sandwiched between. I like this Cd, because it has a few good songs, but if you don't love Korn, I wouldn't recommend buying this"
3,What's the difference of this version?,"This CD is no longer available and it costs more than a new CD. I didn't get it because there is no information of any special edition. Here's the only info I could find elsewhere. Original release bonus disk""Chi"" (live) - KoRn""All Washed Up"" (live) - The Urge""Hilikus"" - IncubusDuring the recording of this album, the following songs were also written:Proud - 3:14 (released on the I Know What You Did Last Summer soundtrack)Kick The P.A. - 3:21 (eventually released on the soundtrack to Spawn)Engine #9 - (unrecorded cover by Deftones)Ain't Goin' Out Like That - (unrecorded cover by Cypress Hill)"
5,Why Do People Disrespect This Album?,Why do people consider this cd to be a dissapointment? With tracks like Mr. Rogers and Good God i just cant see it being considered one. Follow the Leader is bad and issues is HORRIBLE. Korn has been dead for a long time but atleast they left behind 2 classic albums. Let the preppy kids have KoRn.
2,Are you MAD?!,"All right, all right; I can't stand it anymore. I love KoRn. I REALLY do. But this is CRAP. I can't believe all the fans who adore this album and even go as far as to call it their best work. This is by far the most juvenile peice of trash this band has made. A grand total of three songs on this album don't FORCE me to shut it off: One is ""Porno Creep"", which is instrumental, the others are ""Good God"" (which is actually a very good song... one of the two preventing a one star rating!) and ""Kill You"" (also pretty good... at times). This album did need to be made, I am glad they got this crap out of their system and GREW UP. If you're looking for the talented, melodic, eerie, wonderfully peiced works this band has put together... IGNORE THIS ALBUM. It never should have gone public."
5,A music fan who love KoRn!!!,"I love this CD. It is definately worth getting. I listen to this CD every day. I am a big KoRn fan. I have two KoRn posters in my room, and all 3 CD's plus electricuted and the a.d.i.d.a.s. single. KoRn is the best band every a live. Everyone should own this CD, an all of their CD's!!!!"
3,Mediocre,"This is undoubtedly the worst of the three Korn CDs, though it still has some good songs on it. Buy the first album first and then buy Follow the Leader, and if you REALLY like Korn come back and but this album, but in the meantime, it's really not worth it. The production is shoddy, the lyrics are contrived, and the music itself is nonexistent and powerless compared to other Korn, with the exception of Good God, A.D.I.D.A.S., and No Place to Hide. In all, though, you can afford to skip this one."
5,"the BEST damn KORN fan in all of iowa, and probably the USA","For all of you out there that say Life Is Peachy sucks, i highly disagree. It doesn't blow your mind like Follow the Leader or KORN but just the fact that it has the KORN genuine sound makes it awesome! And with Jon's screaming in awesome songs like Twist and Kill You, if you like KORN as much as i do (which probably isn't possible) then you should definately pick this one up. Its great."
3,"The worst, but still good, KoRN cd made","Well, I must say, that this is a good cd, but not good enough. It doesn't suck, like others would say, because the best songs on it are Twist, Chi, Good God, No place to hide, and A.D.I.D.A.S. But there are normal good songs such as lost and Swallow. But it doesn't suck, just isn't the best. KORN RULZ!!!!"
5,Life of peachy is by far the best album i've ever heard,"here is a review of the songs1.Twist-10/10-wicked cool jon can do the craziest things with his voice2.Chi-10/10-sick song, my favorite immediatley when i first heard the album3.Lost-7/10-not very catchy, weakest song on the album4.Swallow-8/10-not bad even though it isnt my type5.Porno Creep-9/10-pretty cool i like it a lot6.Good god-10/10 awesome song its unlike anything ive ever heard7.Mr rogers-10/10-Very catchy an interesting song8.K@$#%*-10/10-Great chorus sick as hell, crazy, awesome song9.No place to hide-10/10-My personal favorite, awesome great guitar by munky, never gets old10-Wicked-10/10-another favorite song,Chino from deftones raps its pretty sick11.A.D.I.D.A.S.10/10-Best song on cd awesome lyrics12.lowrider-10/10-pretty similar to the original, funny13.ass itch-10/10-Another one of my favorites, original14.Kill you-10/10-kind of depressing but still wicked coolOverall this is my favorite cd from korn,buy it"
2,Sucks,"This album reminds me of Take a Look in the Mirror, or is it the other way around? It sounds like they jumbled this together in about a week, and unlike Alice in Chains, who can actually make a great album in a week, this album is abysmal. Sure it has some good songs and is quite creative but the songs just don't work. A.D.I.D.A.S is a catchy tune with one of the only memorable riffs Munky and Head ever concocted. ""Good God"" flows well and has the classic verbal explosion in the middle of it. ""Twist"" is a joke, thats not music. ""Kill You"" Once I actually listened to this song and figured out what it was really about, I had trouble listening to it again. And then there is ""Mr. Rogers"".....twisted, demented, spooky.This album will put you in not a happy place, either the music will suck you in and the mood takes control, or you realize that these songs are pretty loose, unstructured and the musicians are about as skillful as Linkin park's drummer and get pissed off."
3,hhmmm interesting!,"I bought this CD after all ready owning the latest two Korn CDs. This one isnt bad at all, I can definately see where they came from musically and where they are going! Cool CD if you are a Korn fan, a lot of cool songs and a few that just leave you thinking ""what the hell was that all about""? check it out!"
3,Korn,I bought this CD not really knowing what was on it. It isn't the best CD that i have had but it is okay.
5,KoRn Rules!!,All of KoRn's CD are good but if you want to go with the most violent CD. Go with life is peachy. A.D.I.D.A.S. & Good God are really great songs & twist is cool to.
5,KEWL!!!,"I want to know if any1 out there know of anything like korn or NIN or marilyn manson or rob zombie cuz im looking for more of a variety, anyone have any suggestions??"
4,this is almost as good as KoRn.,"This is one of my favorate CD's,behined thier first one and the deftones' around the fir. I hope they say cool."
5,Not as satisfying as first Korn.,"Although Life is Peachy has some excellent, heavy and just some kick ass songs like Good God and No Place to Hide, it dramatically falls short of the expectations set by their first cd. It's still a good pick though, if you feel like banging your head."
1,Peachy is rubbish. Even the band admitted it.,Wait a second. All you people are giving this CD 5 stars just because it is by Korn. Sit back and listen to the acutal music. It is awful. It is no where near as good as the other two albums. Even the band admitted in an interview with Metal Hammer a British rock magazin that they realized the album was rubbish. This is the reason that Follow the leader is so good. The band also revealed that they were actually embarassed about the album.
4,Wonderful complement to a thesaurus,"I'm finding this book very useful as I blunder my way along into a copy writing career. It's well-organized, compact and easy to tuck into my computer bag. I still like to have a thesaurus around, but for giving my copy a commercially viable kick in the pants, this book is top notch."
4,Essential for every marketer and sales pro,This book jumpstarts the creative juices in your head and gets you unstuck fast. I highly recommend it to you and attendees at my creative marketing and copywriting conferences.
5,mAKES REAL ESTATE REMARKS & AD WRITING EASIER,"Just enjoying this book. might have laid out differently for my profession (by room, yard, location, etc.) but plenty of inspiration. Thank you!"
4,Great idea book,"I found this book great for stimulating ideas for writing. I am no writing superstar so it's nice to have a reference for adding spice to my writing.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because many of the words are not selling words.For me, it's like a said, a great reference book."
1,do not buy kindle version,great book but on kindle 2 the word lists are so tiny that they are unreadable. the sample did not include any lists so you get no warning till it is too late. total waste of money...
4,words that sell,"I am pleased with this book, it offers a very in-depth listing of words and explains how they can be best utilized in copy. Very helpful."
2,Nothing New to Me,"Given the reviews written here I expected wild revelations in copywriting. What I got was a disappointment. I felt most of the words and ideas here are already overused and familiar. I myself have already used many of them, and I'm fairly new at this.If you're at all experienced in selling I'd probably try the sequel to this book, but as for me, I'll pass on that too."
4,Sometimes cliche's help,"As someone who's spent more years writing copy than anyone should, I assure you these books can't make you creative, so they aren't much help with high-profile advertising. What they can do is help jump-start sentences for more prosaic marcom needs such as brochures, websites and DM letters. For that, they're handy tools...like a good wrench set for word mechanics."
5,Book,"Helpful in conducting my business in that capturing the buyer's attention with words, pictures, etc. is necessary if you're going to make the sale."
5,Info,"Romantic piano [beautiful instrumental versions of classic love songs].by Jeff Victor; Emanuel Kiriakou; Rob ArthurYour song -- You are so beautiful -- Precious and few -- Have I told you lately that I love you -- I will always love you -- This guy's in love with you -- If -- Here, there and everywhere -- Colour my world -- Never my love."
1,Worthless,"I watched this DVD waiting to see the Dead and Quicksilver to show up and guess what?-they're not in it! To even attempt to tie this DVD to the music scene in SF is outrageous. So if you want to start a bar out in the country and get one band to play there, buy this. If you want to see the DEAD-get their DVD, if you want to see QMS-get John Cippolina's tape, JA-get their DVD, etc. But don't buy this one. I watched the SF genre develop and kept hearing about THE CHARLATANS and couldn't understand why they didn't ""break out"" nationally. This tells me why. They just were not good. If you want to ""hear"" the true spirit of SF, buy the first MOBY GRAPE album (CD). It has all you need to hear."
3,What happened to the Thirteenth,"Floor Elevators? I know it is always debateable as to who coined the term psychedelic and who was the first ""psychedelic"" band. I don't know for sure. History is fickle at best in this area, but I do think that in any psychedelic movie the Elevators should certainly at least be mentioned, as well as some other bands of the era...but it is always the Grateful Dead, Big Brother, Quicksilver, and the San Francisco bands that are mentioned. Don't get me wrong. They belong there and I still enjoy their music--especially Quicksilver's--but where are Roky Erikson and the Thirteenth Floor Elevators?"
1,"Slow, boring, for left overs only.","I got this thinking I was going to see some early footage of the Grateful Dead, wrong got 30 seconds of background music. This was made only for the folks who worked at the Red dog and dropped acid there. I was not impressed with this. That worthless left wing propaganda rag called the rolling stone said it was great, save your money, get a Grateful Dead CD. This was a real bore.Eastcoast Phil."
4,Shiny!,Better than I expected! They have gone through the dishwasher a few times now and are still brilliant and sparkle!
4,Not quite as haunting as Haunted,Joyce Carol Oates has an interesting approach to horror. The vague view of the plot and characters allows you to fill in their personalities with the traits of those whom you know. Most of the stories center around family relations gone wrong. I found Haunter more frightening and suggest you read that first.
1,The Squeak,"Restrained and disappointing mild, this follow-up to ""Haunted: Tales of the Grotesque"" didn't render me numb from head to toe yet eerily entranced. The stories seemed strained and forced; very requisite, as if Joyce Carole Oates had a gun pointed to her temple, the nudge of the gun's barrel rattling preconceived story ideas into a mush of oatmeal and brain matter more closely resembling...well, these stories are so ordinary and mundane that an appropriate description is hard to pinpoint. Sad, sad, sad. A huge, HUGE letdown..."
1,GROTESQUELY BORING,When I picked up this book I thought it would be a great way to pass time. It wasn't. The first two stories were interesting but through each story I had to force myself to read through them. By the middle I put it down Mrs. Oates spends more time trying to gross people out and devolop atmosphere than to actually write an intersting story. Avoid at all costs
2,My child likes.......,My child read this book he loved the illistrations but hated the story....!Insted i got the good movie SOSTitanic.
5,Transforming California: A Political History of Land Use and Development,"If you are a student of California history, politics and economic development and you cannot afford the time or the cash to take a semester's course, then I recommend Transforming California by Stephanie Pincetl.Dr. Pincetl is an Adjunct Professor at UCLA's Institute for the Environment. Her book goes along way to explaining the political mess that we find ourselves in today. It also teaches a great deal about the evolution of land, water, and energy use in our state. It suggests that the major water issue in our state in not supply, but the methods used to allocate this resource ... who is to decide and what formulas will be used."
5,Recommend American Limoges and Antique Limoges at Home,"I found American Limoges after reading Debby Dubay's ""Antique Limoges at Home"". If you want to know the difference between antique Limoges and American Limoges I highly recommend Antique Limoges at Home! For more info on American Limoges recommend this book."
4,Good basic reference on American Limoges,"Full-color photos on every page and current price values for each item are the pluses in this book. Many items are not actually identified, however, and names given to the pieces have been coined by the author. Even so, this one serves as a handy reference and guide to those wishing more information on American Limoges, the history and major pieces. I wish there'd been more examples of Viktor Schreckengost's connection to the company and designs made by him for American Limoges but that is a personal preference."
4,Interesting Book,"The author has a chatty writing style that's easy to read and she very knowledgable which she transfers into the book with ease. The only thing I wish were better is the photos of the china. They are inconsistent and I know that glass is difficult to photograph because of the shiny surface, but some of the photos are just poor quality. Overall I am very happy with this purchase."
5,easy to read,This translation uses language that is common and easily understood. The focus of the author was to get away from the poetic and obscure. This translation is a joy and makes the stories fun to read.
5,Still Laughing - Great Song!,This song epitomizes the Christmas season in my house for sure. I'm sure that a lot of guys and gals out there will relate to it! I'm betting that this one becomes a Christmas classic.
1,Out of Date,"Book is not current for the major revisions to FCC regulations that affect amateur radio.Good historical reference, but unusable for passing current Technician exam."
4,Mityvac Pump,Seems to work well. I just bleed my brakes the other day but haven't driving it yet. Static brake eval feels pretty good.
4,vaccum brake bleeder,"Haven't had a chance to use it yet, but the pump seems to be much more sturdy than cheaper, plastic pumps. It comes with a large set of adapters, fittings, and master cylinder fill plates in a blow molded case. I'm looking forward to bleeding my motorcycle brakes and clutch."
4,Mityvac Sliverline,"This is a quality tool. It is constructed in die cast metal. It should be much more robust than plastic. The availability of re-build kits is a great feature. The only gripe is with the instruction manual. If clear large sized illustrations were paired with concise written instructions, it would be a major improvement over the current format. Currently the manual is printed in a hard to read fine print font. The information is vague and incomplete."
3,very informative....at the time,"I wanted to know how the original band broke up, and true to form, you never really get a straight answer from Paul or Gene. This video is packed with great clips from the 70's. I could skip the entire 80's thing. Gene looking like Bea Arthur isn't good for anyone."
5,X-Treme Closeup,"This video is still enjoyable to watch after all these years. This has the terrific videos from ""Hot in the Shade"" & is an in depth interview with Gene and Paul with a tiny bit from Bruce and Eric.Worth getting if you're a KISS fan."
4,good history,"I liked the whole music videos that were there and the history of the band that was there, but I wish that more of the whole videos were shown and more of KISS's history with Vinnie Vincent was talked about."
3,TORN,"This video spans KISS' history from the very beginning all the way up to 1992 (Just as the ""Revenge"" album was coming out). The reason why I'm torn between giving this video 5 stars or 2 is because I felt that KISS should have gone more in depth about their 80's glam-metal days, and even the ""Unmasked"" album for crying out loud. I also felt they should have included interviews with, at that time, former members Peter Criss (1972-1980;1996-Present), Ace Frehley (1973-1982;1996-Prsent), Vinnie Vincent (1982-1984), and Mark St. John (1984, and YES KISS FANS I SAID MARK ST. JOHN !!). But either way i give this video 3 stars."
1,TOTAL JUNK,"Never used, you get what you pay for, my bad. Presently in service as a prop rod for a car that I am restoring.I would give it a zero if I could."
3,"Parental, Scheduling Controls a Nuisance","The Motorola BR700 has great security and port forwarding features. It has selective packet filtering, as well as ""ping"" protection from the WAN side of your network. If these features are all you need, then the BR700 might be a good choice. However, if you require trustworthy scheduling and/or parental controls for you network, you should consider another router. In my network, I run 6 computers, and have tried and tried to get the parental controls to work as specified. The best I could do was to get a particular computer to turn on or off, completely ignoring the scheduling and web filtering (URL, Keyword) settings. The apply, reset combo did not work for me. As one reviewer said, it took him hours to get his parental controls to work...Who wants to spend hours of their time fiddling with ""arcane"" settings, which should be intuitive? I would gladly have given this router 5 stars if everything had worked as advertised."
3,Parental Controls Do Not Work,"The Motorola BR700 is a very secure router with abundant controls and features. It would be the perfect router--if only everything worked as specified. Motorola advertises its BR700 possesses ""robust"" parental controls, and it is one of the main reasons I bought it. However robust these controls may be, THEY DO NOT WORK. I have contacted Motorola concerning this issue, and am awaiting a reply. As far as I know, no firmware update has been released to fix this problem. Recommendation: if parental controls are important to you, then purchase another router."
5,greatest fitness video ever,"With the help of this video, and proper diet, i was able to loose 5 lbs in the first week alone! =P I would recommend this to everyone i know. =) =) =P"
1,Disappointing,"The photography is beautiful, but the narration is embarrassingly ridiculous -- and frequently unrelated to what is actually being shown onscreen at the time -- as if the person responsible for synching the audio and video did not understand the language being spoken so did not know what images should go with which words. The voice-over translation for Masakazu Nagata is flat and awkward. It is not worth the investment of your time (or money)."
1,Absolutely awful!,The packaging of this DVD is very misleading. I assumed I was buying a series by the renowned Discovery Channel. This is a cheap knockoff. The video is horrible and the english translating is worse. Don't waste your money!
2,Gross Exploitation of the Ocean,"There are some nice shots in this video. Which is why I didn't give it one star. But this show would have been better served if it was a seafood cooking program. After a scene of fish swimming in the reefs we see the narrator eating them. Not my kind of nature show. They do show indigenous people living off the ocean in various ways, but all in all, it's all too exploitive for my sensibility. Like I said, it's more a culinary than nature oriented series. It makes me thankful that David Attenborough doesn't eat the creatures he shows us. I'd rather see Julia Child swimming in the ocean flambéing a live turtle, than recommend this DVD!"
3,Great K-8 Educational Tool,"This DVD set is a great elementary and middle school educational tool. While the video quality is top notch, the background music is kind of funky as is the English translation."
2,Very difficult read and extremely apologetic,"I have read many great histories and technical works concerning WW2 but I spent more time in the dictionary than I did reading this book. The first, oh say, half of the book is at times fascinating but it quickly goes down hill (or vertically declines as the author would probably put it). The entirety of the text became extremely apologetic in my view. He seems to intimate that the blame for the Pacific War rested with the ""White peril"" and the blockades of the poor, pitiful, Nipponese. The fact is they chose of their own free will to attack Pearl Harbor and they deserved much more than they received. Sorry but in our current political climate I am tired of Americans apologizing to the rest of the world. If you are set for a hard read and are savvy enough not to be influenced by leftist leaning, marxist reading than this is the book for you. Make sure you have Mr Webster close though."
3,Get a dictionary,This was the hardest book I have read in some time. I have a GEDDower has a PHD and it shows. I could have gotten more from this book if I didn't have to stop and use the dictionary every half page. Maybe they will make a plain english edition some day.
1,Blanket Liberal Generalization,"J.A.A. Stockwin's blurb sounds like one of The New York Times adjectival laden editorial praise's of U.S. war crimes. If writers interpret a culture, Yukio Mishima, one of the major writers of post-war Japan & of the 20th century, could hardly be said to have embraced ""defeat""."
4,Solid Historical Analysis,"Mr. Dower's discussions of the Japanese economy, culture and constitution are incredibly well done, easy to read, and educational. Parts of his discussions of censorship by occupation forces and the war crimes trials seem to drag and take on a strident tone. In all, it is an exceptional book."
5,Excellent analysis/explanation of the U.S. occupation post WWii and its effects through the next 50 years,"Certainly deserves the Pulitzer it received.An unbiased, thorough description and analysis of the years during and after the U.S. occupation of Japan.A must read for anyone interested in understanding why Japan is the way it is and how it got there."
3,need better narrator,"the narrator makes up his own pronunciation of japanese names and words,really irritating, not to mention unprofessional. same problem is on a lot of TTC lectures."
4,Great account of postwar Japan,"I'm more of a historical novel reader, because great novels like ""The Triumph and the Glory"" or ""The Emperor's General"" usually more interesting than history volumes. But Embracing Defeat is very well-written and commanded my interest from start to finish."
1,Tell it to the marines.,"Dower must have gone to some other country. I served in Japan, did close -order drill on the Emperor's front lawn, learned a bit of the language, studied under the leading expert on Japanese history, spent a sabattical year in Japan - and more - and I think Dower's picture is absurd and harmful. I'm not alone; all the GI's I knew felt very much at home in Japan. It's a great country - every outfit has its scoundrels. Japan is the world's leading creditor; we are the greatest debtor. Japan's pre-war economic aims have been achieved and surpassed. It's hard to say what our aims were, and the Occupation's floundering provides no clues. Dower's ethnocentrism is embarrassing."
4,Taught me much about Japanese culture,"I learned more about Japanese culture from ""Embracing Defeat"" than from any other book on Japan, and I've read many. Before, I thought the Japanese were very mysterious. Now I'm beginning to feel that they are pretty much like westerners. The ""inscrutible Oriental"" is a misconception dating to pre-WWII.My only criticism of ""Embracing Defeat"" is that the author is strongly pro-Japanese and anti-American. Is it true that the American occupation forces were arrogant, power-hungry, and stupid? Was McArthur inept? I would like to think that the author exaggerated."
3,An interesting topic with mixed results.,"At time Embracing Defeat is great and informative reading. At other times it is too dry. I felt the first 300 pages of this book were very good. The second half was too dry. Also, at times the book is too sympathic to the Japanese. It is difficult to feel much sympathy for the misplaced and stranded Japanese left in places like China and Korea. The crimes committed by these troops far outweights their struggles to return to Japan. I believe the author is married to a Japanese woman which can cloud his view of Japan. Again, a good effort, good at times, but ultimately a mixed effort"
2,Non-Sociologists Beware,"If you liked deTocqueville, or are a professional sociologist, you will love this book. Otherwise beware. The numerous details about blackmarkets, prostitution, and day-to-day survival, although well written, are mind-numbing. I could not see the forest for the trees!"
2,For scholars only!,"While this is a Pulitzer prize winning essay on the post WWII years in Japan, it is not intended for the lay reader or amateur history buff. I have an intense interest in history, especially the WWI era but I found it impossible to find a compelling narrative in this incredibly heavy tome. In fact, after reading the first 100 or so pages, I skipped through the rest of the book, reading a page here and a chapter there. Then I put the book in my recycle bin. An incredbily hard slog."
1,P. C. Lens Distorts,"""Embracing Defeat"" is a masterpiece of scholarship; well researched and meticulous.It is also, quite unfortunately, more about demonstrating how ""enlightened and evolved"" the author is (and by extension, our Politically Correct times), than it is about explaining anything about the past that would have been intelligible to a participant.This critical flaw makes this book less than useful as a study in how the U. S. oversaw an effective Occupation that transformed a totalitarian enemy into an allied republic. Instead, we hear the agony that we are not utopian in every utterance of the author.What a shame!"
4,"interesting, but could have used more context","This is a really interesting book, discussing how the Japanese handled the 5 - 10 years after WWII. And it has a ton of information in it, both big picture as well as a lot of detail.The one thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it does not do a good job of placing what is described in the bigger picture of Japan at that time or of the allies. It's as though McArthur and the allied occupation is there, and at times has a (sometimes very strong) influence. But the rest of the time - nothing about them. And yet, they were the most significant single force for change in the culture.The same for the overall political climate in Japan. The emperor appears occasionally as do the top politicians. And the mood of the citizens is covered at times. But a lot of the time what is happening is listed as though it occurs in a vaccuum.With all that said - it's a real good book on a topic that is interesting."
1,may not work on your Mac,"Very frustrating - Amazingly, this won't install on Panther (OS 10.3) - advise that you consult the Apple discussion boards befoe buying this. Some people report getting it to work on OS 10.2."
5,A caress for my ears and my mind,"This is a very good two-disc CD. The bansuri-player (flute-player), the tabla-player (drummer) and the tanpura-player (drone-lute-player) all do a fantastic work. The drone is played with a fifth and an octave counted from the lowest tone. All this music is like a caress for my ears and my mind."
2,These Guys Have Lost Their Humor & Their Edge,"Very disappointing sophomore album, with only a few good songs that seem dated already. These songs seem rather preachy, more didactic than the raw and wry gems on their first album. Still, Skin has an amazing versatile voice and their first album was so good that I'm just gonna cross my fingers and hope that their next album delivers more."
5,"Real-life, easy-to-read...perfect!","With a small baby at home, I don't have much time to devote to personal reading, but The Diet Survivor's Handbook made it so easy for me. Each lesson is only 2 - 3 pages long, so I could take in valuable bits and pieces over time. Not only did things like ""Create abundance for yourself"" or ""Cherish your body and its uniqueness"" help me in my personal journey, but the lessons also made it easier for me to share the message with others. I recommend this quick and easy read to current and recovering chronic dieters everywhere."
1,Didn't work for us,"I received this book as a gift. I am a physician, and have been trained in dietetics and nutrition. Sorry, but this book just does not make sense to me. Not to mention, new products are giving us dieters the hope that a few sprinkles of fake ""sugar"" or ""salt"" cause huge loss in appetite in surveys and experiments. Why, then, fight a losing or sad battle, when a product such as SENSA and others can get you to your desired weight?These women no doubt mean well, but they are not medical doctors. They should stay focused on their training, which I believe is social work. Also, they seem to miss the real symptoms that can occur if their program is followed, such as heart disease, etc. Finally, I noticed that some of the five star reviewers are personal friends or relatives of the authors, which makes me wonder about the credibility there."
3,Fast Delivery,"The item was shipped very quickly. 3 business days of the 3-5 day promise. The only issue I have is that the mounting piece (between the 2 screw holes that go into the gun) is shorter than what the picture advertises. Basically instead of the center piece being longer than the screw pieces (as shown) it is actually shorter.Look all the way left of the image, the piece between the 2 screw holes. The item I recieved does NOT have the center piece that sticks LEFT of the screw holes, but instead stops to the RIGHT of the screw holes. This creates more stress on the pieces with the screws, causing the plastic to crack or break.I was worried about the shorter center piece, because people are complaining of the plastic screw holes breaking off, but we will see how it handles at this saturday's paintball game.Good job on the shipping ultimate paintball, but maybe update the graphic if your going to ship the shorter piece."
5,WoW!!!! Totally out of this world...,"If you're not like my mom, than you have to love it! I keep on listening to the CD, I can recommend Taste of India, where you can feel that you're really in India standing next to Tyler...or The Farm, listening to the funny text that comes from The Wizard of Oz and lots more...! Buy it! If you loved Get a Grip, you'll love this even more!"
2,Not so good,"I'm sorry to disagree, but at this stage of their career Aerosmith simply don't have the creativity to release THIRTEEN new songs in an album !!!! The result is that the CD is too much irregular, with too much highs and lows, and ends up being a very boring aquisition."
5,So good I wore out the CD,"This is by far the best CD I have ever purchased. I have loved Aerosmith since the 80's, but had never bought one of their CDs for some unknown reason. I was at the store getting CDs for my husband and decided to get it. I played the thing none stop until I wore out 2 of the tracks. I'm going to have to get another one."
5,Wow! Cool computer games on it!! And lyrics too!!,"Not only does this have that awesome Aerosmith-ness to it, it is an enhanced CD. You get COOL games for the price of a song CD. It is so much fun. It has lyrics too. This CD rocks - not JUST because AEROSMITH does, but because this has the most awesome songs on it! It's still Aerosmith - pure and true..."
4,Little Bizarre,I bought this one because it has the song Pink. But there are more songs to rock away to!!
4,Top CD!!!,Great album! i think that PINK and AINT THAT A BITCH are the best songs but THE FARM is also cool. Get it now.
2,Commercial & Synthetic,"So, what? Aerosmith was one of the most purely jamming groups in the 70's. But when Joe Perry left for a while, the band lost their focus and started making synthetic and desperate albums. This one is trying to reach the jamming level of the 70's releases, but it fails. Sure, there are some good jams here and there, but it's too musch show, and not enough pure rock'n'roll. Instead of using pure and raw energy, Steven Tyler is falling into the deep swamp of divavocalists. Sad destiny with this group. Too pity."
2,Forgettable,"Awful, murky production and a shortage of memorable songs makes this 1997 album an uneven listen at best.Songs like ""Full Circle"", ""Hole In My Soul"", and to a certain extend also ""Falling In Love"" and ""Pink"" are quite good, but the remaining eight or nine songs are forgettable at best and some of them are just awful.The ballads ""Kiss Your Past Goodbye"" and ""Fallen Angels"" are slick and clichéd, and several tracks sound like an old, scratchy LP, buried as they are in feedback, annoying sound effects, and assorted noise and distortion.Aerosmith's attempt to sound vibrant and hip fall completely flat...I don't know why they don't just settle for being Aerosmith, they used to be such a good, tough rock n' roll combo back in the 70s.Not anymore, though. No wonder that you can get a used copy of this CD for less than a buck."
1,HORRIBLE,"This is one of the worst rock cd that i ever listened. The only songs that i like are nine lives and full circle, the rest of them are very stupid and boring!!!! Aerosmith isn't cool anymore."
5,GREAT CD! Highly Recommended for any fan!,"For any Aerosmith fan, this is one of the greatest. When I was about 4, my dad(gotta be one of the world's biggest Aerosmith fans!)turned me on to ""Dude Looks Like A Lady"" and ever since, I've been a HUGE Aerosmith fan. This is one of the better albums, and I highly recommend it to any Aerosmith fan or Rock'and'Roller! Rock on forever Aerosmith!"
5,Aerosmith Nine Lives: a great comeback,"Aerosmith's Nine Lives CD is one of the best they have had in a long time. Some of the great songs include Love in Your Heart (is hard on the knees), Hole in My Soul, and Pink to name a few. The songs are packed with fast paced music and great lyrics to top it off. This CD is a great one to add to the collection of any Aerosmtih fan. END"
2,sub-par for this band,"Aerosmith has cranked out truckloads of awesome albums. I guess eventually, the odds would end up that they'd make a stinker.This album lacked the energy and direction of previous albums. It was as if Aerosmith was having an identity crisis.""Pump"" or ""Toys in the Attic"" are much better representations of what Aerosmith can do."
1,SELL-OUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Nothing more clearly demonstrates that one of the greatest bands of the 1970s has become a bunch of sell-outs than this album (except maybe their new single ""I don't want to miss a thing."" I bought this album 2 years ago and am yet to listen to it all the way through. It is simply horrible."
4,"ZIROQ, THE NEW GENERATION OF SPANISH MUSIC........","I just purchased this great and outstanding cd,and I love it.This Cd starts with some hot spanish gypsy style with the lead guitar of Marcus Nand. Ziroq blend the spanish music with pop,latin,also arabic style.The ziroq express how well they play this music.The most vivid and beautiful of this cd is on some tracks,Marcus plays an outstanding guitar music with fury and passion. The adding the arabic music to the flamenco music is a creative job that Ziroq had done.Oh,yeah,the vocal sound of Marcus really are melodious and gypsy syle,and it matches with this music....After all of these,the track the most I love in this Cd, is number 11,NOMADE,..My heart flies when this song plays.Buy this cd, ENJOY IT.....viva ziroq......"
5,Spicy Hot!,If you want a cd that can create a sense of escape then this is the one. Listening to this cd makes you wish you were sitting on an exotic island with someone you love!If I had to describe it in one word it would be: SEXY!
5,Excellent Read,This book is great. I found it extremely helpful. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into ticket sales. I work with the Los Angeles Galaxy soccer team. It's already made a difference in my business. Thanks Mark!
1,Amazon mailed duplicate CD'S,"I ordered a 4 CD set. I received 4 cd's, however the 3rd and 4th cd were identical to the 1st and 2nd cd! I have duplicate cd's and I do not know how to correct their mistake!"
1,I wish I'd never read this book.,"Mr. Stephenson should have been more persistent in his attempt to keep this book from becoming reborn. It's terrible! If you really want more Neal, seek out the Wired issue were he writes about being a Hacker Tourist. Or order up a used copy of the eco thriller Zodiac which is a hundred times better. Or just read Snow Crash again. Please don't buy this book. Please. Okay, so you have to have it. Fine. Do the hacker thing. Seek it out online. There are at least a dozen mirror sites serving up this text. But if you go this route do us all a favor, edit it up, and repost a fixed version."
2,Mildly amusing,"The Big U is a book that is far better when you're 20 than when you are 30, and I while I found it enjoyable 10 years ago I wouldn't go through the trouble now unless I was a Stephenson completist. There are flashes in the book of the writer than Stephenson has become, but it is a typical first published novel, which is to say, showing promise, but not really very good. Stephenson himself only consented to the reprints under duress.Buy this book if you have to have all of Stephenson's work, and are still in college or at least still think you are in college. Otherwise you won't miss anything by not reading it."
3,Starts great but fizzles out,"This novel about life at an enormous university completely fizzles out at the end. It starts out interesting, with several different characters, including feuding roommates, an older, cat-owning physics student, and a senior student body president who is not interested in freshman floor bonding. You think these are going to be the main plotlines, but the D&D gamers end up taking over the whole story. They bored me to death. I won't give anything away, but somehow after 9/11/01, reading about kids calling themselves ""Terrorists"" running around playing pranks in high rise buildings is chilling. The university is obviously modeled on Boston University: witness the large neon sign, the autocratic unpopular president, the turnpike running under the campus, the football stadium in the middle of the towers, and the Plex itself which is a dead-ringer for Warren Towers."
2,Stephenson's right to leave this one by the wayside,"A throwaway novel, written in a Randian-cartoonish style (and much of the plot is tedious verisimilitude -- do you really want to relive those juvenile college years?)Snow Crash worked better; no need to pine for this one."
5,Somone needs to get this book back in print!!!,"In brief: I read this book when I was 14 yrs old and understood about 10% of it. PLEASE REISSUE THIS BOOK, I WILL BUY 20 COPIES AS GIFTS!"
3,Stephenson doesn't pull it off,"I would've read The Big U even if it had been universally panned. Ever since I read Snow Crash -- one of the most influential science fiction novels of the last 20 years -- Stephenson has been my favorite author. I love audacious satire, and the fact that Stephenson and I are of similar age and share many interests doesn't hurt.Although there are some funny moments, and although I know a fair amount about circa-1980 campus life at B.U. (because my wife went there), I didn't care for this book. Most of the characters were one-dimensional, the satire wasn't particularly deft, and the plot wasn't nearly as compelling as Stephenson's later novels.The best moments in The Big U have to do with recognizing B.U.-inspired material. If you don't know about John Silber or the Citgo sign or the flaming couch, or if you aren't a true Stephenson devotee, I doubt you'll enjoy this book."
3,typical Stephenson romp,"A typical Stephenson romp, the Big U is fast paced and surreal. Although the publishers would have you believe this is a satire, it's no more satire of University life than the Deliverator is satire of the Dominoes man and our society at large: that is to say, it's satire, but that's not the point of the book. Stephenson excels at creating a world that seems to overlap with rather than exist in what we call reality, with the non-overlapping part peopled by casual bad-asses who come out of the woodwork as soon as the necessary overarching crisis presents itself. The Big U is no exception. Typical of Stephenson books, the ending is weak, but that didn't stop me from finishing it in 5 hours and recommending it to all of my friends who've enjoyed Snow Crash and Cryptonomicon (although i still say Zodiac is his best book, but for some reason i can't get anyone to read it)."
2,Not a good start for an otherwise great author.,"I picked up this book at the library after reading Snow Crash and Diamond Age. Even the Neal Stephenson completist should consider not buying this book. It's poorly written and was left out-of-print for so long for a good reason. I highly reccommend anything else by this author, though."
1,Clearly a Graduate of His Own Fictional MegaUniversity,"Nothing is worse than a book with a promising start that gets progressively more tedious with every passing page. Stephenson's satire on college life degenerates into a miraculously idiotic tale that goes WAY over the top and becomes a blatantly violent, purposeless bloodbath. By the start of the spring semester (the second half of the book), you'll realize you're in the unsteady hands of an alleged author who smugly revels in his own imagined cleverness and who obviously needs to revisit Fiction Writing 101 at his local university. Not interesting. Not funny. Not even remotely amusing. Not recommended."
2,I Read It When It Was New,"I'm in, perhaps, one of the smallest groups in the world -- the folks who read this book when it was new. I was in college, bought it in paperback at the University Bookstore, no less. I read through the first half, and gave up. At the time (this was 1984 or 1985) I just couldn't get interested in it at all. It wasn't bad, exactly, it just didn't make me want to keep reading."
4,Its funny because it's true!,"Maybe it helps that I lived in close proximity to Boston University for years (one of the models for American Megaversity -- the neon ""Big Wheel"" petroleum company sign was the giveaway) and I grew up in close proximity to ZooMass, um I mean UMass...""The Big U"" is a tremendously funny take on the experience of being a square peg in the round hole of the hive-mind crypto-facist experience that passes for higher education in America. Stephenson skewers the wretched excess of every facet of big-college life, from the BMOCs to the terminally self-obsessed campus politicos.This is definitely a ""first novel"" and it occasionally suffers from the pitfalls of first-novel-ness (verbal excess, convoluted plotlines), but don't let that distract you from the wonderfully insane plot(s) and hauntingly familiar characters that pepper the story. Everyone is a target; you will eventually recognize yourself somewhere in these pages."
3,Grunt. A very so-so book,"Stephenson is only getting better with each book that comes out. Of course, he didn't exactly set the world on fire with this, his first book. This is an odd book, at best. The first half is almost a pretty funny satire of modern college life and those of you who attended massive universities will get a chuckle or two out of it. The second half of the book starts off poorly and falls apart completely at the end. I won't go into detail, mainly because it all blurs together, but it really is unimpressive. Obviously, this book is being re-released to capitalize on the success of Cryptonomicon, but feel free to give it a pass unless you are a die-hard fan of the author. If not, I recommend starting with Zodiac, or with the seminal Snow Crash."
5,Awesome,"This is a great phone. I was looking for a durible, fun, bright phone and this is perfect. I has great gadgets. I once droped out of a second story window and it still worked well. It is the best phone I've ever had."
2,JUNK,"this earpiece has very low volume level, and in fact is pretty near worthless unless your in a mortuary. I also bought the H500 and it too is a piece of crap"
2,Feels cheap...,"I got it for free with a cell phone deal, so I shouldn't complain. However, for those of you intending to buy it - I wouldn't if I were you. The sound quality deteriorates as soon as you put even a small obstruction in the way (like, when you put inside a pocket). And in general it feels as if it's made of cheap materials and unprofessionally. I don't have any experience with other BlueTooth sets, but I was definitely disappointed with this one."
2,Not good,Recently I was moved to a project where camera phones are not allowed in the work area. I thought I was doing a smart thing when I purchased this bluetooth handsfree. The package mentions 100 meter coverage but it is not more than 20 odd feet I guess. You can use it only if you carry your mobile on you.
5,Great bluetooth item.,This is my second H350 and both work great. Not recommended in a noisey environment. You will forget you have it on your ear at times.
5,Excellent,"Excellent, everything was ok, the item is new in box and works like I thought. The item is like in the pictures."
1,Not what I wanted.,"Ordered a 350, got a 500. Battery life terrible. Pairing and connecting to phone very difficult. Just not happy. Wrote company and never heard back. I have been using this for a couple of weeks and it has not gotten any better. Piece of crap. And still no response from the seller."
1,IT WORKED THEN IT STOP WORKING...,"I RECIEVED THIS BLUETOOTH LESS THAN A WEEK AGO. TODAY IT STOP WORKING. IT IS STILL PAIRED WITH MY CELL PHONE BUT IT DOESNT ANSWER NOR DOES IT RING IN MY EAR AND IT IS FULLY CHARGED.I EVEN TRIED RECONNECTING IT.. TO NO AVAIL. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BLUTHTOOTH FROM THIS COMPANY, MORE N LESS WIRELESS. I AM TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED."
3,echos?,Sometimes when I call the people on the other end say that they can hear themselves and other times people say it sounds just fine. I just bought it today but I might be returning it to get the H500.
4,Great ear piece,I recently bought the H350. I work as a paramedic so I am always talking on the phone to supervisors and to the hospitals. Having a high quality hands free ear piece was something I found in the H350. It works and sounds great. My wife tried mine and liked it so much that I bought her one as well. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable yet high quality bluetooth.
3,Does the job I bought it for,"This bluetooth headset has not given any real problems since I bought it. It charges quickly, but it is difficult to flash between calls. At times, the earpiece volume is quiet and other times, there is an echo for the person on the other end of the ine, but overall it works well. Functions as it should at least 90% of the time."
4,Good but not Great,"I have used several bluetooth headsets and I think this one is pretty good especially considering its price. I am not having many of the problems that many others are having (falling off the ear, feeling cheap, static, etc). It fits my ear great but I will agree that its not designed to be worn for more than an hour.I feel the quality is great considering its price. The only static I have is when I go father than 20-30 feet away. The headset has its own volume control which is great as I noticed there are some people I can and they talk low. What I do is turn the volume up on my cell AND turn the volume up on the headset.The only real problem I have is at random times, I get the little annoying chime sometimes during phone calls even after being fully charged"
3,haven't figured it out yet,"me & my husband got these headsets, his never really worked very well but in the beginning mine was fine then it did its own thing. i took it to cingular to have it repaired and within 2 minutes of leaving the store it stopped working again. i went back again and it did the same thing again... at that point i said forget it and put it in my purse. about a week later i looked at my phone and it showed that it was connected to the bluetooth so i started using it. it worked fine that day but the next day when i went to use it the phone said that it was not connected, i've tried it a few times since then and it still says the same thing. so now its just riding around in my car. and after 3 trips to cingular my husband gave up on his too and ACCIDENTLY ran over it."
2,average quality - static reception - function sporadically,"We've bought two Motorola H350 bluetooth headsets for our Motorola V551 phones. The earclip on the headset did not fit well to the ear. It was very loose. The voice quality from the headset was not very clear. After 10 feet separation from the phone, static noise occurred. Sometimes the headset would not link to the phone. For approximately $30.00 this headset is just average in quality."
3,"OK for the price, but don't expect much","I agree with other reviews...for the price, it's not bad. The button on the headset is not consistent or reliable to use...sometimes it redials and sometimes it activates voice dialing. Because the button is so inconsistent I use my phone for dialing, hanging up, etc. This is OK, but it would be better to have a reliable headset button to do these things.It is light and fits nicely on my ear. It holds charge for a very long time. Some people I call say they have an echo on their end when they speak to me. They do hear me fine and say that it is very clear. I find the volume on the headset to be adequate and can hear everything even at highway speeds.Very easy to link and get started. Once again, for the price, OK..."
2,Don't like it!,"I got this unit with my phone and though it looks cool, it just doesn't fit right. It constantly ""flops"" off the ear, making it hard to hear, and the loop behind the ear doesn't hold it tightly. I have to constantly put my hand up to press it to my ear to hear while driving. I've since gotten the Samsung WEP 200, which is TINY, fits in the ear, is very comfortable and has great sound quality."
2,"It works, but you have to tolerate the static and buzzing","I bought this for a Samsung A870.Pros: It pairs easily, fits well on the ear, and the buttons are easy to use.Cons: Way too much noise on the recieving end. Caller hears noticable static interference often and a constant faint buzzing noise. But aside from all the noise, the caller can still make out what you said and vice versa when talking. The noise is just annoying to have to put up with, and I am sure that there are better products out there.Bottom line: I am not sure if it is just the Samsung phone I am using it with, or if this product is always this bad. I guess I am going to keep shopping."
3,Pretty Good for under $40,It works good with my Samsung A920. It gives me good reception everywhere I go with no static and a good amount of distance away from the phone. I could leave my phone in my room and walk around the house being able to make and recieve calls.
3,"Ok, but didn't fit","This was ok, people heard me ok, but the piece kept slipping off my ear. It took a lot of coordination to keep the earpiece on my ear."
3,Good looking only,"I got this in the thanksgiving sale. The look is good and matched my black Samsung A900 cell phone. Voice quality is good on my end but the other side complains about strong static. I also paired it with computer and the static issue is still there (you cannot hear it until you playback your own voice).You get what you pay for. A good gift, though. I will stick with my Sony Ericsson HBH-PV700 until I am sick of its toy look..."
4,"My first headset, mixed review","Its sound quality is top notch, i have no problem hearing anyone and the person at the other end has no problem hearing me. The buttons are easy to use while its attached and work very well.My beef is that it only works on the right ear and if you wear glasses, you're screwed. It doesn't like to stay wrapped over the ear if its sharing space with a pair of eyeglasses, so it dangles too much. I wish Motorola made a headset that fit more snug around the ear."
1,Doesn't work with my Iphone,"I bought this thinking I might save some money but when I got it and paired it with my iPhone I could hear the people just fine, the problem was they couldn't hear me. I tried everything I read to get this thing to work and finally called Motorola. I guess this is an issue they have with this model, sometimes the voice microphone doesn't work. Anyway they are sending me a H300 to replace it. I guess I got what I paid for."
3,Unsure,I bought two of these. They feel cheap. Very lightweight feel like plastic. Both have echoing issues and one had issues connecting. Might end up returning them.
1,trash,"The volume on the headset is to quiet, the person on the other line hears more of their own echo than anything, they hear a lot of background noise and you need to yell for anyone to hear you, this headset is trash"
2,Motorola H350,"I bought one of these for my wife a few years ago as a Christmas present. When I recently needed a bluetooth headset (my first) I asked my wife how she liked it, she said it was OK, and I bought one on sale for very cheap. It paired easily to my new phone and the callers on the other side were clear to me, but the headset created a loud humming noise only audible to the people I was talking to. It made it nearly impossible for them to hear me. Here is what I disliked about it:-the speaker sits on top of your ear and even at the loudest volume, I found it very hard to hear callers on the other end when I was driving-the part that wraps around your ear was very, very uncomfortable on the back side of my ear. I found myself taking it off when I wasn't on the phone-the humming that callers could hear made it useless. My wife's doesn't have this problem so I could have gotten a dud, but the comfort would have been enough for me to return it anyway, which I just did."
4,Good Value,"I have another Motorola Bluetooth, which cost more, however the quality of the sound on this less costly Bluetooth is as good or better. I have no discomfort from wearing it, and I enjoy it that the piece that goes over your ear is more stable than my other one. The other Motorola Bluetooth has problems with the two pieced par t that hangs over the ear. If the plastic end piece breaks, which mine did, there appears to be no replacement parts. Thus I have not used the other for months, but this Motorola H350 has been very reliable for a third of the cost of my other Motorola Bluetooth."
2,disappointing,"this bluetooth head set is inconsistent. I'd say a third of the time, people ask me to repeat myself or say I sound like I'm in a wind tunnel. I never had this problem with the Jabra headset I had (and sadly lost). It can be quite frustrating, but I'll probably muddle through with it for a year until the technology improves some."
2,Not good for women,"I bought this item as a gift for my wife to use with her Razor cell phone. It would not stay in place when she tried to wear it. Actually when I tried it on it didn't fit me either. Not adjustable as far as the ear loop goes. So I shipped it back for a refund. Maybe if you have a very large circumference earbase it might stay, but otherwise every time she turned her head it fell off."
2,motorola 350 bluetooth,"this product is very easy to use but not very clear. You get alot of feedback, it doesn't pair with all phones."
1,Bad sound quality,A huge disappointment. Extremely poor sound quality from what I thought was a trusted brand name. Avoid.
2,Lots of static and disrupted talking,"At initial use, I quickly noticed that there was a buzzing and static noise when the headset was on and connected to the phone. And the people on the other end couldn't hear what I was saying because of static and my speech is distorted and disrupted by static (similar to a bad reception). I then used the recording feature on my phone and spoke into my headset and counted 1 to 10. Certain numbers could get cut out and you can barely hear my voice.I contacted Motorola and worked with their tech support to reset the headset (turn it on, charge it for 3 sec with the power adapter, unplug it and its been reset). I ended up sending it back to Motorola for a product exchange since there was a 1yr warranty. I'm still waiting for the replacement...will edit upon receipt of new headset to see if it was just that one headset or the entire model is like this."
4,Great Item for the Price,"Bought this item for my wife who is new to bluetooth headsets. No complaints so far! It's comfortable, sound quality is adequate, and it's lightweight. Price was definitely a bargain. Would highly recommend this item."
2,Worked for 20 minutes...then won't connect,"I bought 2 of these actually. One for my wife which works ok. And one for me, which I got to work initially, but 20 minutes later it disconnected itself and I haven's been able to get it to work since. Unfortunately, I threw away the box so i don't think I can return it. I bought the Plantronics 510 which is a little bulkier, but I find it works much better. I guess I'm out the 30 bucks for the Motorola."
2,NOT THE BEST,"It's a bit hard to evaluate because much of it depends on the type of phone and service you have. I have a 1st generation Motorola slvr phone. The H350 connects fine but I sometimes have trouble getting clear reception. Sometimes I have to reset it because the other party can't hear me but i can hear them. Also it sometimes just turns off on me, I'm not sure how or why it does this. In general it's not the best choice."
3,battery drains too fast,Pros: Good and reliable connectionCons: Battery drains too fastI had this for a while now and I moved to a different model bluetooth from Motorola. There is not good off button so the battery would drain fast. Also it was awkward in my ears.
