5,An inspiring adventure into oneself,"In my years I spent as a sannyasin, I went through lots of things, ups, downs, extasy, sorrow, life at the maximum. Reading this book brought me back to those years of crazyness and aliveness. I recomend this book to anyone who wishes to see a detailed strory of a spiritual quest. From the mind to the unknown."
4,Love this CD!,"First off, I am new to FfF. I heard their song ""World"" in a Sears commercial, and I think I heard ""100 Years"" in a Chase commercial a while ago. I love this CD. I can listen to it over and over and it doesn't get old. FfF is so talented, the highs that he can hit are simply amazing for a male singer. The only song I could live without is Policeman's Xmas Party. I have no idea why that's even there, it doesn't fit with the rest of the CD."
2,Wish I could get a refund,Not even in the same ballpark as the last album. All these songs sound the same...boring.
5,Great Record!,"It is a rare treat to find a record where virtually each song is as good, as the next."
3,Unexpected,"I finally bought this CD after hearing The Riddle a long time ago on the radio. I loved that song and so I was really excited when I finally got around to buying the CD. I went home and put it on my ipod right away, but I ended up being dissapointed by a lot of the songs. Some of the songs were good like The World, but none of them were really like The Riddle, so I suggest that if you are considering buying the CD for that one song, DONT! Just go and download it online (leagally please^_^) because most likely, (if you're like me at least) you wont like the rest of the CD as much as the one song."
5,Well designed,"Does what it claims, simply and quickly. Quality construction that will hold up. We set up containment for construction project in minutes rather than the several hours fabricating one. Plus, absolutely no damage to painted surfaces. Great tool"
3,Okay book!,The snap and button are a little hard for an adult to use let alone a little one. We are trying to use it a lot to get them loosened up!
3,Yeah for Zoe but the snaps and buttons are too hard!,I can barely snap the snaps in this book and the buttons are too hard for little hands. I like the thought because my children love Elmo and Zoe but the Elmo Doll worked better for practice purposes.
5,Excellent background,This book is an excellent background study for anyone interested in the origins of the Republican Party in the 1850's before it became the Party of Jefferson Davis and Southern social conservatives in the 1970's and 1980's.
4,Good to the last cup,I found this coffee to be very tasteful and delicious. This was my first time ordering coffee on Amazon and I am thrilled with the results
2,it's not worthy it!,"I got it for $12, it's totally not worthy it. The picture is misleading. There's only one strawberry pattern on the corner, not like the picture shows many. Also, when I unrolled this product, the cotton debris fall over on everywhere."
2,not what i was expecting,It is generally hard to guage if a towel will be high quality and soft just from a description. This towel set is definitely not great. I bought it based on the original price which seemed high. It is also smaller than I'd expected. I don't recommend it.
4,pretty good!,"not bad! i really liked the idea of this book and the way the relationship changed so fluidly. it was very romantic but not my type of ""love at first sight"" preferable romance"
2,Hate It,This Game Is So Awful. I Have Never Played A Game That Awful It's The Worst Dreamcast Game There Is. I Advise You Don't Get It.
1,ESPN DISAPPOINTMENT BASKETBALL.,THIS WILL BE SHORT THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS GAME WAS ESPN ANNOUNCER STEWART SCOTT.THAT ALL.
4,Really Good Cd to listen to....,This Cd has tons of good songs on it to listen to whether you are working out or just going to and from work or cruising around.............Not every song is good but for the majority most of them are really good..and i definitely recommend it.................
2,i agree wit the ben,yep they've done it again with mixing if only they've hadn't done the mixing it would be the blast
5,best small concordance around,"This book was printed in 1977 only. it is a bare bones concordance no hebrew no greek it is the same as the main concordance in the big book. I had been looking for a comprehensive kjv bible concordance that i could easily handle and carry with me to bible studies, i tried crudens but the multiple categories for the same word was a hindrance to me. ie: lay-up, lay hold, lay down, etc, i tried some small revised strongs such as ""nelsons compact"" which has good coverage but very small type and not complete enough also ""strong's handi-reference concordance"" has excluded far to many words and doesnt list all the occurrences of the words they do have.I finally found what i was looking for. it's print is readable, it's coverage is complete, it has strong thin paperand is a handy size 9""x7"" x1.2"". isbn 9780801080876 by baker book house 1977. Happy Studying."
5,Catholicism in America,"Just about anything you ever wanted to know about Catholicism in the American experience. Very scholarly. Articles include a history of the Church in every state, major figures that impacted the Church and American society. Copies of letters and speeches from notables such as President Kennedy. Statements from the American bishops on war, poverty, and justice. I even found the article on the Church and slavery to be eye opening. Lists of population figures and brief summaries of Catholic institutions of higher learning. Some of the articles deal with all of the ""Americas"" which puts the US Church in perspective with the rest of the American hemisphere."

2,Buy this one at the used book store,"I am sorry Ms. Roberts didn't do this book justice, it is very tiresome. I guess when you crank books out as fast as she does, and I've read them all and enjoyed the experience!!!!,you can't always be a winner. But, for the price of paperbacks, I would like my money back....at least, I'm thankful I didn't have to buy it in hard back. I'll still buy her books, I love her writing and look forward to the next one."
5,Face the Fire,Have all her books. Love the way each book in this series includes all the previous characters. Hope another series comes soon!!
5,Face the Fire,"Again book for my wife so it's her review.Very enjoyable, would love another trilogy to see what happens in their lives from here."
3,Bewitching ;),"A little too fluffy, which I guess is to be expected from Nora Roberts, but a good story. Make sure to read all three!"
4,Different,"The Trilogy is certainly different, but interesting and light reading. I just love Nora Roberts' writing. The three books take you through various family members and intertwines well. All three books is a must."
4,Face the Fire - Three Sisters Trilogy - Book 3,I really enjoyed this series by Nora RobertsIt was a little different with the whole modern day witch thing but a good easy read.I enjoy the variation of styles in Nora Roberts novelsThis series was different from her other books I've read but just as enjoyable
3,The best of the three but still doesn't cut the mustard,"Mia is bigger than life. She's the most powerful of the three witches and in this conclusion to the three sisters trilogy she faces her test against evil. In my opinion, this book suffers from the same problems as its two prequels. Character development could be better and plot is rather cliche. The story is somewhat slow going and didn't hold my interest very well but it's OK for light summer reading. The ending was rather weak compared to to the two first novels but moments of humor scattered throughout the book (especially involving Ripley) saved the story.I was disappointed in this series because Nora Roberts was highly reccomended to me by a friend. I didn't plan on reading anymore of her literature but recently, I picked up a copy of Carolina Moon and already find it better than any of the books in the Sisters series."
2,"Nora, what happened????",Ok folks Nora got me hooked with the first book in the trilogy. Excellent read {5 stars}... The second one was not a good as the first but still very good {4 1/2 stars}. I was so excited about the third novel that I went and got it the first day it came out. I just could not wait to see how it all ended... What the heck happened to the third novel??? Very anti-climatic and almost boring compaired to the first two books... I was very disappointed with the ending of this trilogy.
1,Nora Missed the Boat on this One!,"It's been awhile since I read the second in this series and was so looking forward to the last. What a disappointment. It almost seems as if I'm reading one of the other two books, sometimes word for word. And my memory isn't THAT good :)I think Ms. Roberts needs to take a break - a total break from any sort of writing for awhile, then maybe she would come up with some fresh ideas. She's had a great following up til' now, don't risk losing it, Nora."
2,Say it isn't so,"Normally I love to read Nora Roberts(J.D. Robb), but not this time.I loved the first two novels in the series. I thoroughly enjoyed the bantering between Mia and Ripley, and Nell was just too sweet for words.Face the Fire seems rushed to me. There's a whole lot of uninteresting pointless dialog. The characters personalities seem so mellow compaired to the other novels. It's like they've all had too much Paxil. Especially Ripley, who was my favorite character in the series. The ending left me feeling nothing. No sense of relief, excitement, or happily ever after.Overall, I was very disappointed in this one."
3,Disappointed,"Although the first book in the series was excellent, I was semi-disappointed with the second book and very disappointed with the third. Sam and Mia's story was typical and expected. There was not anything new introduced in the book and the magic just became a little old. The romance was almost cookie-cutter romance style with a guy getting the girl ending. Plus at the final showdown why do we have a sheriff wielding a gun and a geek with a gieger counter? Please, Nora you are a better writer than that.Don't get me wrong I love Nora Roberts. I think she has written a great many wonderful books but I also think that if you want to read an exceptional novel by her you almost need to go back a few years and pick up one of her old ones. The suspence is interesting and on the edge of your seat and the romance and the characters have depth."
5,face the fire Nora Roberts,"another excellent read from Nora Roberts this is the third book in the three sisters trilogy, takes place in New England"
4,Resisting an Old Love,"If you read the first two books in the trilogy, you'll be glad to find Mia's story unfold in this book. A drop-dead beautiful, extremely powerful witch, Mia seems to have her life well-planned until Sam, her first and only love returns to the island. They still strike sparks but Mia uses all her powers to resist falling for Sam again. His efforts to revitalize the island's hotel serves to throw them together.An evil power lurks around the island and challenges Mia in several ways. The growing unrest from this draws Nell and Riply to join forces with Mia to protect them all. Interesting scenes of witchcraft, sexy encounters and a thoroughly good read.I'd say of the three books, my favorite was the first one."
1,Disappointment,"What a disappointing book! I usually like Nora Roberts, but this book was a major let-down considering Mia seemed to be the main character. I really expected her story to shine and I really expected that Sam wouldn't be easily forgiven; forgiveness came with no effort on his part at all. The chemistry between the two characters was weak and relied upon their history as children instead of their present personalities. This was by far the weakest of the three in this series and I'm definitely going to be more cautious when buying Roberts' books -- they used to be on my automatic purchase list, but now they're not. This is certainly not a book that warrants above 3 stars. Save your money and borrow a friends' copy!"
2,Disappointed,"I think this is the first Nora Roberts book that I put down and didn't finish. I just could not get into this one and was disappointed. I liked the first book and was okay with the 2nd but this I just couldn't care about. First, I did like Mia but Hated that she was constantly flirting with Riley's boyfriend/husband and that he reacted to her made me a little uneasy as well. Anyway, Sam was just a disappointment....okay he leaves her FLAT without explaination, even after sleeping with her and writing that saying on the wall in the cave, then he has the nerve to come back 10 years later and wonder about her coldness. He thinks she is just going to blow up at him and he would soothe her. I wouldn't have even given him that after breaking her heart so completly. Just couldn't get past that and the book was a bit boring. This series just went flat and I am a huge Nora Roberts fan.Oh well, this one just wasn't for me."
3,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this final installment of the trilogy. Mia was my favorite character from the first 2 books and I was really looking forward to reading her story, and the exciting conclusion to the series. Not only did Mia get short-changed in the character development aspect in this book, but the big finish I was expecting fizzled to an unimpressive whiz-pop.Admitedly, part of the reason why I didn't like this book is that I don't like Nora's brooding characters as much as I like her tom-boys and sweet girls. They're hard to write and even harder to write sympathetically. I absolutely adored Nell and Ripley, but Mia left me cold. In the same way, I fell in love with Zack and Mac, but I couldn't have cared less about Sam.The scenery was delicious, as always, and the book wasn't a total loss. It's just that Nora is the IT girl, and it was disappointing to read a less than stellar book of hers."
4,Good book and good trilogy.,"It seemed to me that all the women's trials were to either reclaim or remember something important in themselves: Nell had to regain her courage and thus her strength, Ripley had to remember her mercy and find true justice, and Mia had to relearn how to trust and how to forgive and thus to gain a deeper, better love than she had originally owned.Another of the interesting things was how the love stories of the three modern ""sisters"" echoed those of the ones from 300 years ago. Naturally Sam had to leave; after all, so had his counterpart in the past and the past needed to be balanced for everything to straighten out properly.And it was fitting that, finally, there was someone to take the place of the last element. There are traditionally four and it really struck me as wrong in ""Air"" when there were only three.Bravo, Ms. Roberts!"
3,The fire just fizzled,"I too, agree with other readers who were disappointed with this very anti-climatic ending. After the first two books, and the big build up in this one, I was really expecting a big bang, to pull everything together, but it just didn't happen. I liked how it explained more in detail, about why Ripley had turned away from the craft and Mia, and was glad that she still was able to keep her strong character, even though the tough-girl routine did get a little annoying at times. Overall the characters were enjoyable, but by the third book became a little too predictable."
3,Face the Fire (Three Sisters Island Trilogy),"While I enjoyed the series and was sad to finish the last book, I did find Nora Roberts a little on the predictable side. Personally I like to be shocked, like surprise endings. You will not find that with this book. After reading the first two, I was able to figure out the ending of the third half way through. Regardless, I do recommend this book and would also like to see a sequel series based on the next generation of witches."
2,Disappointed so mote it be,"I really like the first book, the second was for me a slight step down and maybe I was just expecting tooooooo much from the 3rd but I was surely let down. I am an avid NR reader and this one was well below her normal grade. She had built Mia into such a compelling character in the first two books and this one just somehow didn't deliver."
4,"Nora Roberts' ""Face the Fire""","This last book a in series of Three Sisters Island,""Face The Fire"", was written in a way to catch and keep you in suspense and was not disappointed with the ending. Writer was very informed on her subject. Thank you Amazon."
3,Ehhh,"Now, I have not read the other two in the series, so I will not comment on the supernatural plot (which I actually found to be kind of stupid).I could not connect to Mia. She was just too cold, and so were Nell and Ripley, to Sam. Yes, he left her. But the fact that he wanted to fix what he did is mature. And the way she talked to her friend's husband Mac really pissed me off. He also seemed to be affected by it, like when he'd blush, which made Mia seem like such a flirt, and not very intelligent. I really liked Sam's character, and felt that everybody was just too mean to him.Not having read the other two, that's all I can really say. Though I don't think I will go out of my way to, judging by how I felt about this excuse for a finale."
3,Disappointment was the spell of this book,"Not worth the wait. The first two were great, so I was expecting more. However, you should read just for the conclusion."
5,Great series,"I love this series and I'm hoping that Nora Roberts decides to write another trilogy featuring the three sisters of Mia, Ripley and Nell. She could easily turn this trilogy into something like her In Death series."
5,Great Ending to the Trilogy,"I could not wait to read this book and boy was I not disappointed! Mia and Sam have a great spark that you can feel leap off the pages. Mia tries to fight her attraction and love for Sam not just for herself, but also for the fate of the island and those she loves. Sam on the other hand, tries to gain the trust back from the woman that he left 11 years ago and will stop at nothing, even death, to get it. It is a delightful book and fits in well with the other two. I could not put it down and just had to finish it the night I got it."
3,Face the Fire,"I am an avid Nora Roberts fan but was a little disappointed in this book. Mia, the main character was delightful in the first two books of the triology, but I was not impressed with her development in this book. I thought the premise of being angry at Sam was too drawn out for too long. It is still worth reading but I would of liked to see more development in the characters that is the usual Nora Roberts trademark. I just didn't seem to like Mia that much in this novel."
2,ANYONE GOT CLIFF NOTES?,"THE FIRST OF THE TRILOGY WAS THE BEST, AND YOU CAN'T READ THE THIRD WITHOUT READING THE FIRST, SO STRIKE ONE. READING THIS ONE MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL BRIT LIT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BEOWULF. I COULD USE SOME CLIFF NOTES. VERY LITTLE STORY, JUST A BUNCH OF WORDS STRUNG TOGETHER, STRIKE TWO. THE RIPLEY CHARACTER STILL REMAINS ABRASIVE AND ANNOYING AND I GOT BORED WITH THAT....STRIKE THREE."
4,Face the Fire,"I truly enjoyed the Three Sisters Trilogy... also ""A Little Magic"". I found the Cordina stories rather difficult to finish, as the storyline and characters seemed very ""slow"". Highly recommend for Nora Roberts fans to check out Judith McNaught titles, too! I particularly enjoyed ""Something Wonderful"", ""Double Standards"" and ""Once and Again""."
4,A so-so ending,"The series was fun to read, but the ending did disappoint me a little bit. Maybe we all have our ideas of what would be a perfect ending and when it doesn't go as we'd like, it wasn't a good book? The first book was by far the best one out of the three!"
4,A Good Ending,"This was a good ending to a great trilogy. This wasn't my favorite book of the series, but it definitely had it's good points. I don't think this was the greatest book NR has ever written, but it's still a great book to finish out the series. It ties up loose ends, and clears up some of the questions still riding from the other two books in the ""Three Sisters Island"" Trilogy. All in all, this was still a good novel. It moved quickly and kept my attention."
4,Face the Fire,"Mia Devlin is a strong beautiful witch that owns a bookstore/café on Three Sisters. She keeps buried a deep hurt from her childhood when the love of her life, Sam Logan, left her broken just out of high school.Sam is back, and he is determined to win Mia back. He knows what a mistake he made leaving. He was so young, and the powerful emotions she brought out in him scared him, so he ran. Sam is also a witch, and he is willing to use whatever it takes to gain Mia's trust.Mia and Sam must find their way back to each other, or they will not have the strength for the upcoming fight of their lives.A great finish to the series. I liked that Mia was fire and Sam was water - fire & ice!"
2,Uh...thats it?,"Not up to par in any way, shape, or form. this series had GREAT build up, first with Nell, then with Ripley, but Mia...Sweetie... dont you know ""Hell hath no fury, like a woman scorned.""?I mean really there seemed to be no ""fire"" in the scenes no anger for the way or reason Sam Logan just up and left the island.It was like He's back lets forgive him... but that's not my only issue...What happened at the end? Good versus Evil? With Nell, she had to face her past, with Ripley she had to accept, whats Mia doing????Just to set the record sraight I am a HUGE Nora FAN! But i was so disappointed in this book. So disappointed, infact, that when I finished reading it, I turned it back to page one and started over because I never thought that it would just end... with no...anything it just ends. No pop not even a fizzle.So in closing READ NORA ROBERTS...just not this book!!"
2,Bit of a letdown...,"The third in a trilogy, Face the Fire was disappointingly slow and uninteresting. I would read it to complete the trilogy, but I do not recommend it as one of Roberts' great pieces."
2,Disappointed,"I guess I really was looking forward to this book and when I finally read it, I was disappointed. The story lacked something. I finished the book feeling like I was missing something. I really loved the first two and I knew Mia was such strong and interesting character in the other two. I was really looking forward to getting her story; however, in this book she almost seems shallow."
3,Forced myself to finish,The modicum of energy that existed in the trilogy's first installment completely fizzled by the midpoint of Face the Fire. I didn't particularly care for Mia and I wasn't invested in the big supernatural showdown or her love story. I had a hard time keeping a straight face while reading the chants and incantations. This trilogy receives outstanding reviews but I found the entire thing ho-hum.
5,loved it,Last book in series and was every bit as good as first two books Nora Roberts really knows how to draw you into a story and keep you there
4,"Wonderful story, short ending",The story line was great! Full of mystery and romance. The build up to the final battle was huge! However the battle itself was dissapointing to me. I expected it to be bigger. But - Overall the book is great!
3,An ok ending,"It was a so-so ending. It got a little confusing at the very end with so much going on at the same time. The series started out good and if you already started the series finish it until the end if not, I would skip over the series completley. Not my favorite."
5,Face the Fire,"Nora Roberts once more hits 10 stars with this trilogy. If you love Roberts, this is one of her finest!"
3,"A fine start, but this novel runs out of steam","I was a little disappointed in the ending of this novel. Of course I knew it had to end, but I expected something much more climactic since Mia Devlin had been cast as the stronger of the three sisters in the first two novels. I expected her story to be the most powerful, yet ultimately I found it to be the weakest. In the beginning, her anger at Sam was interesting, and the romantic scenes in this novel were much more believable to the character than in books one and two. However, with one simple conversation, it's as if Mia says, ""Oh well...that's ok...the past decade is forgiven."" Just a little hard to swallow.... The joining of her power with Sam's was very believable in the early scenes, but when it comes to the ending, I guess I expected much more. Everything seemed to be over-simplified. Still, it's worth the read, and you won't feel satisfied until you finish the trilogy if you have already read the first two books."
2,Big Disappointment,"I am an avid Nora Roberts fan, however, this book was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! I found the first two books in the series really exciting, but could never really get into this book. I thought this would be the most exciting of the series because Mia was so stunningly beautiful and so exotic. Not so. I don't know what happened, but it never really grabbed. me."
3,Could have been better,"I really like Nora Roberts and I've enjoyed this series a lot. However, I thought that Mia deserved a better story than this. She was the most intriguing of the 3 women in this trilogy and the romance was a little flat. I thought Sam should have been a bit more desperate & not so sure of himself!It was a good read overall, but somewhat anticlimatic. She's fire, there should have been more sparks!"
2,A disappointing conclusion,"Mia's character and hints about Sam were explored in the first two books of the trilogy leading to a delicious sense of anticipation for the romance between the two of them in third book. I found this story to be somewhat contrived and a disappointment. Mia and Sam are both strong characters and the book did not do justice to either of them. The reason why Sam left Mia was weak. The grudge Mia held for Sam throughout most of the book was even weaker. This conclusion to the trilogy betrayed both characters. I feel that Nora Roberts is one of the best romantic novelists around, but must admit I skipped thru about a third of the book, finding it boring, slow going and forced. Fortunately Ms. Roberts can be counted on to produce good writing more often than not!"
2,Disappointing,"I stuggled to finish this book! It started off well, but then it lost steam. Personally, I think this trilogy was one of Nora Roberts' weakest."
2,Third book...a big let down.,"This was not as exciting as the first 2 books. I expected with all the lead up in the the first of the series that this would be more thrilling than the first 2 as she had a much harder decision to make. It wasn't! There were more love scenes than any of the drama, mystery and mysticism that I was hoping for. My advice is don't bother unless you like saying ""Big deal"" to yourself at the end of the book."
1,what has happened?,"What is wrong with Nora Roberts? Her latest books about witchcraft and devils?? This is so not her. I long for a good book like her ""THe Villa"" or some of her past books with some depth and character development. I could not finish them and took them back to the dealer. Ick!"
2,Third time isn't a charm,Sam! Mia! The first two books set up the sizzle that should have outshown the other two sisters and their romances. What happened? I was really disappointed with this book.... It was a very weak conclusion to the triology.
2,Contrived-Not even embers,"I absolutely loved the first of this trilogy. It had everything going for it. But by this book, well, where was the editor.I guess it started going downhill in the second book when instead of a real villian and real human emotions like fury and despair being the catalyst, Roberts went toward this undefined evil. It gets to the point in Face the Fire, where the book is basically a show-off for her knowledge of Wiccan speak. Zack Todd is now indistinguishable from some of her other heroes (Aidan in Jewels of the Sun comes to mind) and Ripley is also just a shadow of her former self-Booke has been reduced to a one-dimensional Ghost Buster. She keeps bring things out of left field just to make things work without ever having shown them before.The ending is muddy, rushed and not quite followable. I'm sure this book will sell, simply because it is the third-but I'm not going to be rushing out for the next trilogy."
2,Ok... but not as much character development as I and II,"Don't get me wrong--- nobody does a romantic trilogy like Nora Roberts. But I must confess--- the third book in the Sisters trilogy left me somewhat disappointed. My favorite component of Nora Roberts' novels is the character development. Mia's story with Sam left much to be desired. I was longing for more flashbacks- more meat about their history together. The plot, surrounding the wolf-demon- was vague, and Mia's ""challenge"" didn't seem as intense as the previous novels. I'm still a fan--- but this was a bit of a let down."
3,Not up to par,"The first book in this trilogy was the best, and its been downhill from there. The second book dragged in part but still led me to believe that I wanted to read the last book. This book hardly keeps my attention and drags from the very beginning. It will be a struggle to finish. The book reads like an outline and misses the details that allows your imagination to bring the characters to life."
5,Great Series Conclusion,"I have waited impatiently for this final book of the series to hit the streets and was not disappointed. In Face the Fire, Mia, Nell and Ripley continue in their task to rid the island once and for all of the evil waiting to return the island to the sea. We get to learn more about ""Fire's"" past life and what happened to make her so sad. We also get to be there for the return to the island of Mia's only love from his 11-year absense and into Mia's arms. We finally understand what it was that Sam did all those years ago to make Mia still carry anger for him after 11 years and a front row seat to his quest to get Mia back in his life permanently. Nora does an excellent job of spinning all three of sisters' lives together and the end was well worth waiting for. I'm just sad that there's not a 4th book!!!"
5,Face the Fire exceptional Book,"Nora Roberts is one of my favorite authors and she did it again with the creation of these charecters. This book had the right amount of romance, drama and action. I was sorry when I came to the last page. What I would love to happen now is for Nora to take these charecters about 20 years into the future to see what happened to our favorite witches. Nora keep up the good work!"
5,Refreshing romance,I just adored Sam Logan if Mia didn't want him Isure did. He is the ultimate romantic.The picnic and music was wonderful.this book is a perfect Calgon take me away typestory. I just wish that Nora could continue withthe series. Leaving two characters pregnant justmade me want to know how the children will turn out.
4,Wow! I Discovered the Male Nora Roberts,"It was too long of a wait for the conclusion to the Trilogy, but what a wonderful novel!! Well worth the wait. Nora Roberts has a way of drawing you into her stories and not letting you go. For lovers of Nora Roberts, I may have found the male Nora Roberts! I recommend without reservation Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin. Unbelievable characters, descriptions and story. And he is giving $1.00 from every purchase to breast cancer research. You won't be disappointed. Nora, keep writing! It's difficult to wait!"
5,nora roberts book,i recieved this book and read it right away.thanks for sending it so quickly.it completed my set so i was able to read the set one after another.
2,Skip This Book,"This is the last book of Three Sisters Island TrilogySetting: Modern TimesMaybe I am prejudiced since I read the first book and that Nell's story was my favorite-- therefore, I feel that my favorite character is Nell and I could not connect to Mia because in the back of my mind, I felt that the author favored Mia. I couldn't get into the story so I skipped a lot of the pages after hitting the half mark. And maybe even with my prejudices that if the story was really good that I would have rated this higher or have said I liked the story... at least, right?This is a witch series: Nell, Ripley, and Mia1st book- ""Dance Upon the Air"" Nell's story2nd book- ""Heaven and Earth"" Ripley's story3rd book- ""Face the Fire"" Mia's story"
2,Disappointing,"Like other fans, I couldn't wait to read the third installment. Sadly, it fell flat. Not her best work. Buy the book used and share with other Nora Roberts fans, it's the only way you'll get your money out of this one."
3,Face the Fire,"Like several people, I enjoyed the book, but it lacked in comparison with the other two in the series."
4,The series goes out with a bang,"Before reading this trilogy I'd never read anything by Nora Roberts before, which I know is kind of surprising since she's written so much. Anyway, I really enjoyed it and I had unwittingly picked up the first two to take on a long plane ride without realizing that the third had yet to be written! When I finally got ahold of this book I was very happy with it.I couldn't wait to get to Mia's story. Mia seemed to be the most mysterious, independent, confident woman of the three sisters and I just had to know about her life. I think I'd built up too much momentum and excitement over her, though, because I was engrossed in the novel but didn't find it quite as compelling as the other two. However, I still highly recommend it. Mia is one wild woman. ;) And of course all the loose ends from the series are tied up in this last book. I wish there were more books in this particular series!"
2,Okay - who really wrote this book,"This first book really grabbed my attention and left me waiting impatiently for the second. The second was not as good as the first, but I thought it was because I really did not identify with Ripley. However, I expected the third book to really deliver - end the series well and develop the powerful and mysterious Mia. After reading this book, I was sorely disappointed. Other NR trilogies have been spectacular (all three books). In this book things 'happen', without real character or situational development. Suddenly, animosity between characters is gone. Suddenly, a character does something out of character with no explanation. The ending was also a little too romance-novel-cookie cutter for me."
2,Barely treading water,"This album is rather lame. I was expecting more from Embryo, having got Opal and Father Son and Holy Ghost and enjoying them both. Those are good examples of some fairly imaginative German jazz-blues-rock from the '70's. This, however, sounds as uninspired as its title. Long, winding mostly blues-based wankings with no purpose or fire to them at all. The tracks are WAAY too long for what they are - it smells of CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION to me. Whether or not that's true, I don't know, but I do know that I AM trading my copy for something more worthwhile."
4,An Alien Gospel,"This book's focus is on the 'teaching/doctrine' of these so-called 'aliens.' It catalogs not only a point by point refutation of Von Daniken's theories, but exposes an alien philosophy that is clearly anti-Christ. Wilson is warning Christians to not be fooled by beings that bring another gospel (of peace and love), while denying the Biblical truth of original sin, judgment and need for a sinless Savior/Messiah to forgive them."
1,A Very Weak Attempt to Write off Erich von Daniken,"This book is not worth 1 cent of your money. In this book, Clifford Wilson tries to write off von Daniken as wrong and reveal to the world how von Daniken's theories were illogical. The fact is this:his arguments revolved around the idea that Christians knew better than to believe that ""God"" was nothing more than an alien, which were even weaker than von Daniken's illogical jumps!The fact is this:there is no way around von Daniken. Despite the fact that most of his arguments were illogical, he presented lots of interesting points, and most of his illogical arguments were fixed in his sequels.So don't waste your money on this."
2,Errors and lies,This book has so many errors I'm amazed it came from Microsoft. It says you can use NLB with one NIC - you can't. It misdocuments command-line syntax for AC.EXE. I've found so many minor errors that I wish I could just send the book back. Half of this book just duplicates the App Center online manual. I learned more from a presentation I saw at a conference and I'm buying that guy's book when it comes out - Application Center 2000 Configuration by Don Jones.
4,Good from MCSE exams,"I used this book as part of my prep for MCSE exams 70-232 and 70-226. It's almost enough information by itself for 232.The reading is as dry as a technical book is expected to be, but the information is extremely helpful, especially as no study guides are likely to be published for 232 any time soon."
4,"Good book, some errors","This is a good book, and covers many great details of how AppCenter operates. Keep in mind though that the book was published before the final product release, so many of its errors stem from design changes after this book went to press.If you are responsible for an AppCenter cluster, I highly recommend this text. Hopefully MSPress will correct its errors in a new edition.BTW, for the record, you can most definately use NLB if you have only one NIC, you just can't configure AppCenter to use NLB if you don't have two."
2,A huge waste of a good cast,"A B-movie full of cliches and stupidity, not to mention plot twists that just didn't seem to have been properly thought out in advance. I usually like kitsch, low-budget comedy-horror flicks -- they can be a lot of fun. But this one was just painful to watch, to the point where I found myself counting down the minutes until it was over. The wonderful cast of actors and actresses deserved better writing and directing than this movie offered them. Illogical, inane, and insipid, this movie is one I wish I'd never watched, and one I definitely will never watch again. I would have given it one star, but I felt the cast deserved better, hence my rating of two.Then again, I have to admit, for all its faults, it was still better than 'Disaster Movie'. As is a colonoscopy without an anaesthetic."
1,Bugbusters-Another Flop of Heigl's-What's Happening?,"The early portion of Katherine Heigl's career seemed to promise a great deal of upcoming success. But after her release of Wish Upon a Star , things have gone terribly downward, it seems. Bugbusters, was the latest, and prime example. In an age of young actresses succeeding in Hollywood as if there's no tomorrow, why hasn't Heigl made it? She showed brilliance in all movies she put out up to 1996, but since then, there's been nothing. I still maintain she's a fine actress, and seems to be one of Hollywood's very nice, caring young women.However, in Bugbusters, she had to resort to images of ""near nudity (The bathtub and shower scenes)."" What's up Hollywood? Why is it that you're not giving this young, pretty actress the time of day?"
3,Just plain fun!,"This flick is just plain, old-fashioned fun! Cheap thrills and special effects, but the hilarious Randy Quaid and the ever sexy Meredith Salenger and Katherine Heigl more than make up for it. Good ""Friday Night Popcorn Flick""! Lacking in the Extras department, but worth a look."
3,"Good, and could have been better","The movie was good and entertaining but, i found some of the peoplejust to nice and easygoing for this type of movie. Scotty from StarTrek is just too nice of a sheriff and cares too much... and someof the scenes look like they were all shot on the same day and thenedited into their righfull places in the film. So bottom line isthis is a good but not perfect bug/creature movie that is worth atleast one viewing."
2,Bug Buster,"Well guys, I was one of those who made the movie. Comical is the only word for it. Let me tell you, it wasn't intended to be a humorous film at first!-this from the hard working art department"
1,SO I GOT THE WRONG BOOK,"I ordered The Horsemaster and instead received a collection of fairy tales. I am very upset with this fact. While I am sure that I would find some of the fairy tales interesting, they were not what I ordered."
1,Awful junk.,"One of the worse stories I have read. The plot is rather boring and the style confusing, and I didn't really care about any of the characters. The Red Lady was boring,and Gabdon was boring.A candidate for a book-burning. Nice cover, though."
5,"ENGELBERT SINGS ""GOSPEL""","JUST RECEIVED MY CD AND MUST TELL THE READERS THAT IT IS ONE OF THE BEST CD THAT ENGELBERT HAS EVER DONE. WE ALL KNOW THAT HIS VOICE IS A GOD GIVEN TALENT AND TO SING SONGS OF PRAISES WITH THE REKNOWN GOSPEL GROUPS IS JUST DOING IT RIGHT. IT IS SUNG SO BEAUTIFULLY THAT YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF SINGING ALONG.I JUST REALLY CANNOT CHOOSE ANY ONE SONG AS THEY ARE ALL GREAT. ""AMAZING GRACE"" IS ONE THAT EVERYONE KNOWS AND WHAT A THRILL TO HEAR HIM AND THE GROUP SING IT. WE ARE SO LUCKY TO BE ABLE TO HEAR HIM IN THIS MOOD. REALLY IS TERRIFIC - MY FAVORITE BY FAR!!!WHAT A TALENT HE IS AND HOW LUCKY WE ARE TO SHARE WITH HIM WHAT IS HIS. THANK YOU, ENGE!!"
5,Powerful music and lyrics,"Powerful delivery plus powerful lyrics equal Engelbert.The songs on the CD, Always Hear the Harmony, reach deep into one's soul as only Engelbert can do. Thank God for Sending Me You and Our Wedding Song must have been written with Engelbert in mind. Can't imagine hearing them from anyone else. Any gospel fan should buy this CD!"
2,Quality a Disappointment,"I am a huge Engelbert fan, and the idea of an entire gospel album is perfect. He believes in this music and his voice and style had the potential to create one of the best gospel albums ever. However, the terrible production quality of this album has ruined it. Track 5, Take My Hand Precious Lord, has significant audible distortion. I sent it back for a new copy, and it had the same problem! The other tracks are mixed TERRIBLY. His voice is barely audible at times, and the rest of the time the mix is just an echoed mess with too much bass. None of his other albums have that problem, so I think his turning over the production of this album to some local guys in Texas, instead of his usual pro team, was a major mistake. I wouldn't buy this one if I were you. I sent it back and got my money back."
5,"This is a ""Grammy Nominated"" CD","Congratulations to Engelbert for his ""Grammy Nomination"" for this CD, he truly is worthy. Engelberts voice came from ""Heaven"" so it blends with these Gospel songs perfectly!I for one will pray that he wins the Grammy on February 8th.He can sing ""anything"" from Rock to Classical to Gospel, and it looks like he found his genre with this CD.God Bless Engelbert,Marilynn Sacker"
2,Christmas At Trinity Review,"This CD is disappointing. I am certain the choir is superb, but the recording technique left me feeling I was in the third balcony. Do not buy this CD."
4,"Ludicrously bad, but watchable for just that reason.","Basically, a bunch of bland, hairy, plaid-wearing nobodies hike around the woods and get knocked off by Bigfoot. They also reminisce about Bigfoot killing other people.I can't say much about this one, so I'll just leave you with a list:- Scenes are lit literally by campfire.- Gratuitous nudity.- Gratuitous rampant plaid-wearing.- Horrid continuity (including the classic night one minute, day the next, and then night again).- Loads of gore including the infamous castration scene.- Bigfoot looking remarkably like Chewbacca with rabies, and so much more.A horrid movie, but somewhat watchable. I must say it scared me, knowing that Bigfoot is out there, somewhere, always ready to rip my junk off."
1,tsv001 insane priceing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"dj honeybear is right $2,459.95 for night of the demon on vhs!!,VHS!!! listen up you insaniac!!!! are you high on crack or something worse?! nobody in they're right mind is going to pay you such a outragious amount of money for any movie in our countries economic status.so get over your pretentious self!!!! damnit!!!!! lower your price!!!!!!!!!! in fact your prices in general are that of a nutball and we know you're not the only one!!listen up amazon buyers the lowest price on this merchants sight is $89.95 i just had to laugh out loud sardonically.HOLY COW!!!!!"
1,Don't waste your time...,"""Resumes for Education Careers"" is NOT worth the money! The sample resumes are dismally basic, and the sample cover letters are equally as weak. There really isn't anything in this reference book that you couldn't easily figure out or create on your own. Thankfully, it wasn't an expensive book, but remember -- you get what you pay for! (You'd be far better off using ""Expert Resumes for Teachers and Educators"" by Wendy S. Enelow and Louise M. Kursmark.)"
2,just ok,"not bad.long enough for the general use, but a little too stiff.also, because it's silicon things slip too easily. i should have known better and gotten one that holds items firmly without letting them slip.11/15/11 update - i threw it away after keeping it a few years. i just could not stand the slippery ends. the food was constantly sliding and i dropped so many different foods.changing star rating from 4 to 2."
4,"Very good, but spring action too stiff","These tongs appear to be well made. I like the slimmer design of the silicone vs. the bulky nylon ""heads"" of the Oxo, which make it sometimes difficult to pick things up out of the pan. The spring action of the Oxo however, is excellent.The spring action of these silicone tongs is really too stiff. Frying a couple of small batches of chicken fingers, I could feel my forearm starting to tire a bit, (and I'm 6 ft., 240 lbs.)."
5,Great Voice in deed!! I know and have heard her sing!,Nayobe is truly a terrific singer!! Indeed her voice and talents would blow away the so-called singers on radio today! Support her by going to her performances as she can still sing her @$$ off!! Not only a great and humble person but a great singer!! *thumbsup*bigM..
5,Queen of Freestyle,"Nayobe was the first in the Freestyle genre, perhaps a bit ahead of her time and she does not disappoint with this infectious album. 5 stars all the way!"
1,DISSAPOINTED,I ORDERED NAYOBE PLEASE DONT GO CD AND MY ORDER WAS CANCLED AFTER TWO WEEKS BECAUSE THE SELLER SAID THE CD WAS OUT OF STOCK AND I WAS SO LOOKING FOWARD TO THE MERCHANDISE.
5,I'm in Love!!!,This was my second Wusthoff knife. I love it as much or more than my santuko. I now have trouble deciding which to use. I have thown out all the rest of the knives in my drawers. Only Wusthof for me from now on.
1,"few roots here, ""River Niger"" a big disappointment","I love roots reggae, and I have lots of Sly & Robbie in my collection. I don't care for this CD (there are a few tracks here that I like, but they were already in my collection from other CDs)I'd like in particular to voice my distaste for ""River Niger"" (which ""plum village"" liked so much). I think it's unpleasant. It's not roots-y. It sounds to me as if KennyG stopped in for a session.If this CD is reggae at all, it's pop, not roots. But I don't think it's reggae."
4,Grill Cover,"My original Sears cover was getting shredded so I went in search for a replacement. Sears didn't have the ""custom"" ones any more and just had really cheap covers. In searching the Web I cam across Mr. BBQ. The cover is very heavy duty. Cost was less than the inferior Sear's versions. Only negative is that they have a bulky appearance but they have velcro ties on bottom to hold it tight."
5,CALLING A SPADE A SPADE,"Hoffman explains how so many scientist could have erroneously concluded that cold fusion worked. He describes processes that were heretofore misunderstood and led to the fiasco that became the ""Cold Fusion Hoopla."" His remarks were right on the money, for as we see five years later, cold fusion has not become the panacea that it was made out to be."
4,Works great,"I am very happy with the tool package. The only draw back to this is the case. It is to large to fit in any truck tool box, so I basically toss it and get individual tool bags for each tool.I have to put in a special kudos for the cordless jig saw. This is one handy tool. Very powerful, very accurate, well balanced. This is my third package cordless set from dewalt in 6 years. Not to bad for daily construction use."
4,"Great tools, so-so carrying case","I bought this combo kit about 3 years ago and haven't had any problems. I would definitely recommend it, or a variation of it with different tools.My one complaint is the case they come in. Once you've taken everything out, you most likely won't be able to get everything back in and latch the lid without a lot of effort."
1,Writer and Editor Asleep At Keyboard,"While this book does provide some interesting information on the early history of professional theatre in NYC, the sections on later 19th and, more importantly, 20th century theatre is, at best, superficial and often inaccurate. If you're looking for good history, try the vastly superior ""Lost Broadway Theatres"" or ""At This Theatre"". I am truly amazed that such a book was ever reissued!"
5,TYCO to Mattel/Hot Wheels,"I believe that this toy is more durable than the previous TYCO race sets. The quick-click track has improved than the early ones, although it is compatible for any older TYCO racing sets. What's even better for the starter track set is add an additional 9"" lap counter. That will excite the child even further."
2,just so you know....,"From a distance, this is a beautiful ring. On closer inspection however, you will see while the marquise diamond is acceptable, the baguettes are chipped, cracked and broken. Furthermore, while the page indicates the ring may be adjusted up or down one size, I could find no way to specify the size I desired and because I paid with a credit card could not do so by email. I do plan to keep the ring, but my jeweler said there is a good possibility, due to the condition of the stones, they will need to be replaced in the future."
4,Alot of Stuff can fit in this bag.,I used this bag for about 6 months. At the time I had 4 lenses a flash and a 20d. And lots of other little things. Everything fit well. The shoulder strap is large and has lots of cushion. Though it is not very comfortable when loaded down. The nonslip rubber does not work the best. Other than that this bag is amazing and will easily fit The 3 major zooms and a few primes.
4,"Tons of fun, requires parent interaction","This is a swing, not a bouncer or jumper, so it requires a parent to push the baby in it. My almost 8 month old LOVES it. Be advised that it requires installation in a ceiling stud, so if you're adverse to putting two small holes in the ceiling, do not buy this product. It also requires that you buy two sturdy eyebolts and two caribiners (not included). The extra hardware cost about $8 from our local home improvement center. We bought the swing on sale for about half price and it is worth every penny, however I would not have paid full price for it. This is great for rainy days indoors or just fun playtime with baby."
2,Boring,"Nothing but boring. First of all, the character of Adria has one of the most annoying voices ever. She plays the clueless, can't add 2 plus 2, and all I like to do is shop stereotype...that is until she hook's up with her best girl friend, whom she promptly leaves for the an actor, who is only using her.The movie is really boring, the characters, although pretty ok (not well) developed, are actually very boring. So, is the rest of the movie. I fast forwarded a lot.The movie at least confronts some stereotypes, albeit briefly, about homosexualism and nature v. nurture. It even talks about tolerance. Yay for them. Still, a very boring movie."
1,Just the Two of us.,"Saw it free on Netflix instant,don't waste your time,it is a long boring ""enlightment"" preachy type movie,no plot,bad dialogue and bad audio.Not to forget the bad music,this one is so boring it is practically a snoozer."
3,Please Read!,"I bought this pack because I'm a fan of old horror movies and Vincent Price. I liked that this package included House on Haunted Hill and The Last Man on Earth. The packaging includes a tin can with a haunting theme that can be played by pressing a red button at the end of the can. This package also includes a bonus horror CD (which I haven't played). Ultimately, the picture quality of the first 4 movies isn't bad, I haven't watched the rest. My biggest complaint is that for the first 2 DVDs and for each movie on the DVDs there is a pause when moving from one chapter/scene to the next; i.e. if the movie has 9 chapters, it will pause 9 times. This holds true for both my DVD players which have given me no problems before. The pause is roughly 2 seconds long and although doesn't ruin the movies, does lessen their quality."
1,Flawed menu design gives you only 5 movies - DO NOT PURCHASE!!!,"Another low budget package of public domain horror films, so I wasn't expecting much, but I got far less.Each disc supposedly contains 2 movies, and when you pop the disc in a menu with the two movie selections comes up. BUT NO MATTER WHICH BUTTON YOU CHOOSE IT ONLY CONNECTS TO THE FIRST FILM! There seems to be no way to get to the second film. This is simply inexcusable.I purchased two copies of this and every disc from each copy is the same, so it's not just a faulty disc. The fault seems to be in their DVD design. DO NOT PURCHASE!So the movies you get are:Horror Hotel, The Last Man on Earth, Dementia 13, The Terror & The Cabinet of Dr. CaligariOne cannot access:House on Haunted HillNight of the Living DeadNightmare CastleDr. Jekyll and Mr. HydeNosferatu"
5,Outstanding!,We host exchange students and modified the rules until their english improved. All of our students got the game as a Christmas present. It was one of their favorites. They taught their parents back home how to play and each year I send a few more games overseas for them to share with the rest of their friends. It is still a favorite game in our home. We adjust the cards dealt depending on how long we want the game to last. Many nights we lose track of time. Our longest session lasted until 4 AM. If you enjoy playing games do not pass this one up!
5,Great for Get-Togethers,"I love this game. It is hilarious when playing in groups to see who will be maliced and the ensuing arguments and debates over who should add the extra card to their pile. Everyone should have this game. Keeps the mind sharp to keep up with what is going on and the spites change the program altogether. BUY THIS GAME, YOU WILL HAVE FUN!"
1,What the heck?,"What the heck? This is a really old game, it's been around at least 50 years, played with several decks of regular canasta type cards. Why would anyone pay $75 just because they added some titles to the wild cards? Just plain greedy, these big toy companies. It's part of what is killing the U.S. Economy. And I'll bet the game is made in China. Shame on Milton Bradley."
3,Pretty Good Follow Up,"I thought the last single by Modjo was one of last years singles of the year.The follow up is good but just isn't as catchy as the last song.It starts of with that same disco Nile Rodgers inspired guitar riff.In fact it does take a sample from Chic's most famous song ""Le Freak"".This one has a lot more bass and strings then the last song.The chorus however is just not as catchy as Lady..,so from that point of view it's a little disappointing.The best bit is the break,when the guitar is faded right down to zero and the bass riff just takes over.As songs go though in this type of genre it is a very worthy effort and I'm totally looking forward to a full album from this group."
3,Nice size but not quite perfect,"The great thing about this paper is its size. You don't often find origami paper that's larger than 6 X 6 inches. However, the paper is a little too thick for the intricate folds required of most origami. In addition, the paper is a solid color -- that is, the same color on both sides. I did not realize this when I purchased this product. This is fine if your origami design does not require the contrast of color that traditional origami paper provides or if you are an experienced folder. If you are new to origami or trying to teach origami to young students, the solid coloring can be confusing as most origami instructions refer to a colored side and a white side."
4,good simple paper,"This stuff is great for typical origami. However, it is a bit coarse and feels like thin construction paper in its texture and how it takes folds. Otherwise works well, like for large groups of kids--used it with my daughter's girl scout troop."
3,Simple but good.,"This book has been around a long time so it does have a track record.The author takes themes of the spiritual life and shows how Thereseunderstood those areas. Although this is not the best of books onthe Little way, it is an excellent introduction for those new toCarmelite spirituality and a good review for those who have beenon the journey a long time."
5,The Love of the Savior,"I BELIEVE IN LOVE is an outstanding book which explores the personal love that Christ has for each individual. It is an answer to the common cry of our modern world, a cry for love. This book delves into the true meaning of love and applies it to how we can love Christ, and how Christ loves us. When read with an open heart, I BELIEVE IN LOVE can change your life."
5,God's love,"This is a wonderful book based on the teachings of St. Therese of Lisieux that is not just a book to read once but it is a companion book to refer to and reflect and medicate on the amazing love that God has for all of us, His children."
3,It's Huge. It's Dark Green.,"I brought a Blue Ember grill from Costco, which is huge and oversized. A grill cover was not included, so Mr. Bar-B-Q's grill cover was the only one I could find. Out of the box, it's dark green. I thought that I had read another review that said that it was dark enough to be nearly black. Nope, it's dark forest green. The inside liner is made from nylon/cotton and tend to catch on any sharp or spikey objects (grill brush). It is huge and it worked, but ended up drapping on to the floor. The velcros didn't really help the length. Lastly, I noticed last weekend that one side of the cover was tattered up. Not sure what happened, but not exactly durable."
3,"Fit my grill, but already ripped","I bought this grill cover about a month ago. I also have the iQue grill, which is too big for most covers. I was happy with this cover because it fit nicely. However, it already has a big hole on one of the corner seams and a large rip along the front. I haven't taken the cover off since the day I put it on. There is some wind where I live, but come on. In the end, not worth it."
3,"Serviceable, but low quality and not freeze-resistant","You can't beat this grill cover on price, but you definitely get what you pay for. I've had 4 of these, and not one makes it through the winter. If you try to cover/uncover your grill in cold temps, the vinyl will crack everywhere. The cracks lead to excessive moisture getting through to your grill and getting absorbed in the cover's lining. Twice I've had the moisture in the lining freeze and stick to my grill. I finally invested in a poly canvas cover and will never go back."
5,Me like,"Have been using on my daily for the past 10 years, one of the few pads I do not kill in least than 6 months. They last be about 2 years. A little noisy but if you are using these pads you are going for the bit and stopping power."
4,survived massive dust storms,...at burning man without failure. the cord to the rain fly snapped when we were breaking down but no biggie. solid tent even for the playa.
1,Wenzel Tent,"Returned tent promptly. Mainly due to the fact that it was too small to fit my needs. Wasn't able to use the tent so that is why my rating is so low. Tent did go up fast and was easy to set-up. The tent stakes were flimsy, and the tent fabric was not to my liking. I think this tent would be great for kids in the backyard. Just too small.UT"
4,Good for the money,"This tent is a great buy for the money. It sets up fast and it is spacious enough for two people including space for backpacks, shoes, etc. Keeps water out well, but be sure to use the rain fly and all of it's straps & stakes to keep the water from dripping inside. Careful not to set up on top of sharp rocks or pinecones, as the floor of the tent may wear thin over time. Packs up pretty small and easily and is light. All together it is a great deal for the price."
3,Great for the weekend moderate camping,"I bought this tent just before I left for a weekend trip. The first night we experienced three huge electrical storms/torrential downpour/ tornado winds, no joke. Possibly the worst weather for a camping trip to the dells. The tent held up fine. We did get a little wet but considering everything the tent was ""the bomb"". NOTE: it would have been helpful to put a nice tarp over the tent if I had one. The rain-fly comes off and 3/4 of the top of the tent gives a great view of the sky and allows for plenty of airflow. The tent is also big enough for a queen size air mattress, also very helpful. For light or moderate camping weekend style, you can't get a better tent for the price. If you can spend more and get something that looks a little more modern but would have to spend much more to get something functionally better."
5,Good,For first time campers this is great... it should have taken me 10 minutes to assemble but I'll admit it took me half an hour. This is a two man job and was very spacious inside. I only recommend getting a nice tarp to put under it and padded yoga mats to put under the sleeping bags... Excellent deal.
1,Beware of any bad weather!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Just got back from Caprock Canyon. Cool front moved in one night and the winds snapped one of the main support poles. During the storm I had to go outside and reset both of the rainfly supports, one of them twice. The rainfly support has two poles. The poles don't clip or tie in place so they pop out with any real wind at all. The walls needed major support and the rainfly is small only covering the top portion of the tent so whipping wind does and will easily blow the rain in. The tent is a great size and is easy to set up, but pay attention to what I'm writing please. It is not made for any real weather. It will be great for a short uneventful campout at a statepark. Better pray no bad weather sneaks up on you. I am sending mine back. Remember that you get what you pay for. I wanted to believe this would be the right tent for me because of the price, size and weight, but boy was I wrong. Choose wisely my friend."
2,Not good for heavy rain.,"This tent was very easy to setup and easy enough to put back. I was able to get it back in the bag fairly easily. However we have heavy rain this past Saturday night and it didn't do a very good of keeping rain out. Of course for the price I paid I shouldn't have been very surprised, but if you're looking for a sturdy 3-4 person tent for all weather camping this is probably not the choice for you."
4,Good tent,"I really like the tent, it sets up easy and is roomy. Being a hiker it would be nice if it were a little lighter, but it fits nicely inside my backpack. Seems very sturdy and has guy lines, I have not used it in the rain yet but on a regular night the inside stayed dry. I would buy another one."
4,A very good tent!,"it's easy to assembly this tent, less than 5 minutes, and it looks sturdy but i have not used it during heavy rain, so hopefully it can stay dry inside. The carry weight is very light compared to its size and the color is very pleasant in setting of outddor nature. WOULD BUY IT AGAIN if it can withstand some degree of mother nature disaster like strong winding or heavy raining. love it since see it first time, and byaway it does keep all the bugs out at nightime."
4,a very good buy,"Have used this tent three times this summer. It has lived up to previous good reviews. On my last trip we had severe thunderstorms and got a very small drip (should have used seem sealer and didn't). The other tent being used that night collapsed from the wind, ours stayed up. As for getting this thing back in the bag, anyone who has ever rolled up a wrestling mat will easily get it in the bag. Overall, this tent is a great value for the price."
3,If you need a basic tent - this is the one,For an average camper that's not going to be doing anything extreme then this is your tent. 2 people MAX - i don't know what 4 people they are talking about. Can't beat the price though. I plan to upgrade in 1-2 years.
5,Survive in Style,"""Be prepared!"" This inexpensive, easy to use, tent is part of our survival kit! (ready.gov has more suggestions!)"
2,Pole already broken,"The tent was very easy to set up and can fit 4 kids, although it was a tight fit. I was disappointed however, after the kids had been in there an hour the tent collapsed because one of the poles bent. I don't know exactly what they were doing in there but I feel the poles should of held up better. I can no longer use the tent until I get a replacement pole."
4,Wenzel tent,"I purchased this tent a few years ago and I am still using it. Has worked well, is easy to set up, and didnt leak when it rained."
3,B25 Mitchell,"Have not finished building it yet. The balsa pieces require quite a bit of cutting and sanding, moreso than other models I have built from Guillow. This is time consuming so progress is slow."
1,Second rate commercial pap will always suck.,"It doesn't matter when or where the music comes from, if its characterised by dull chord progressions, hackneyed lyrics and lousy production it will never stand the test of time. The songs in this compilation will NEVER NEVER make the grade. I grew up in the eighties, and this collection of truly awful radio hits is testimony to the conservatism that characterised programming at this time. Images of overweight realtors and shopping mall managers twisting and frooging to this dreck at their local beer barn permeate my tortured consciousness. Thank God Nirvana and other bands with integrity came along and changed all that."
3,80s Pop,"Given that we both graduated from high school in 1986, my husband and I are huge fans of music from the 80s: we even played all 80s music at our recent wedding! We own at least 10 different 80s compilation CDs, including this one. This CD focuses on true 80s pop, not necessarily 80s classic hits. For example, although Rick Springfield is included, the song is ""Human Touch"" rather than the mega-hit ""Jessie's Girl."" Similarly, Duran Duran is here with ""Notorius,"" a later and lesser hit. The collection also contains some more obscure bands, including The Outfield, Johnny Hates Jazz, and Dan Hartman. If you are a collector of 80s music, this compilation might fill in some of the gaps, but if you want the best of the 80s, there are better choices out there."
1,non piu...pew,"atrocious. if you're thinking laura (pausini) think again. neither giorgia, nor her songwriters, hold a candle to lp. this cd is devoid of memorable tunes. there is not one. unless you're a fan of whitney houston's more forgettable numbers. save your $20."
2,Didn't like,"I purchased this album because I am a Bocelli fan and heard Giorgia's lovely duet with him. I thought this might be more of the same, but it is not--its tawdry, superficial, kitschy pop that is entirely forgettable. In her defense, I don't speak Italian; if I did perhaps this music would mean more to me, but then, I don't need to understand the lyrics of Bocelli's songs to appreciate his music..."
5,"The ""next"" Mina","Giorgia, crowned the next Mina in Italy has wonderful range and her choice of music has been impeccable. Her greatest hits is a mish-mash from her prior successful CDs...including most of her best work. There are ommissions...like her version of Mina's ""Il cielo in una stanza""...and a few others, but overall this is one bang up CD. The 3 new tracks are a nice addition, especially ""Marzo' which I understand is a dedication to her late singer/boy friend killed in a motorcycle crash in March 2002. This CD is a ""must"" for fans of contemporary Italian music."
5,Therapeutic Massage Music,This collection is also excellent listening during a relaxing therapeutic massage. Enjoy!
5,Great,Perfect for making special goodies. Thick good plastic. Easy to make molds and falls right out easily. Only suggestion is to buy more than one to make molds faster!
1,Rename this CD please.,"I am a big fan of Techno/Trance/Dance music. It is the bigest part of all my CD colection of approx 1400 of them. When I played these 4 CDs, I had to force myself to listen to them just once. They should have named this CD ""Goa 2001: WORST of Psychedelic Trance"". Apparently I don't like psychedelic-trance music. But i did get my house cleaned up while forcing myself to listen to this awful repetitive music.. !!"
5,Loved it from start to finish!,From the begining of this movie I was entertained: great story and love the characters! I'm a big fan of the series! I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good mystery:)
2,Fairly Average,Faith is a Hit&Miss Artist.I tend to Prefer Her Behind the Scenes as a Writer because Her Own Material tends to become a bit Formula Driven.I Like Songs from Her different Albums but on a whole Nothing holds together.She has Talent but the Material on a whole to Me always leaves Her a Bit Short.
5,Buy it !!!,"Before I purchased this cd, I read all the negative and so so reviews. But I wanted something new to listen to, and since I spend most of my salary on CD's there weren't very many options for me. So, with a lot of doubts I bought this CD. I'm happy to say that this money was well spent, and can't believe I waited so long to get. That's what I get for listening to other people. The only way to know if you'll like this CD or not is to buy and see for yourself."
2,"Good, Better, Best, Never let it Rest....","I think that Faith's first album surpassed all of her work from that day to the present. On her first album, every song had a meaning and a feeling that was timeless. Ever since then, each release has lacked that ""rich"" content. Each album has a few songs that you can dance to, and one or two that leave their impression on the listener, but all in all, NOTHING has come close to her first album. I hope that with her next release she takes the time to give us what she did back then... a glimpse of her heart and soul."
4,Keep The Faith,"Definitely Faith's most consistent release. The lead off single jam ""You gets no love"" is a summer jam to crank in the truck. ""Back to love"", ""Burnin' up"" (produced by the Neptunes) shows Faith taking an up-tempo approach, however both are noteworthy tracks. ""Do your time"" is another standout track. a song about falling in love with someone who is doing time. The James Poyser produced ""Love can't hide"" is another gem on this cd full of them. this a true showing of Faith's talents. Bad Boy Records should have done more to promote this winner!"
4,Good CD,"Overall, a very solid CD. From start to finish. I Love You, Where We Stand, Love Can't Hide and Alone In This World... best tracks. Can do without Back to Love [don't really know what she was trying to do with that one.] Otherwise, not as romantic as the first, but more exciting than the second."
5,WORTH THE WAIT,"The beats, the production, the vocals. Faith does it again. She shines above other lackluster artists. I can listen to the whole CD. The only disappointment was the use of the Bad Boy artist, Loon. The tracks, the interludes. All great!! Faith worked very hard on this project and it shows. BUY IT!!some highlights:Alone In This World-uses Who Shot Ya beatYou Gets No Love-contains a little rap by Faye, telling that no-good man offI Love You-co-written by Jennifer LopezLove Can't Hide-so jazzyShe also CO-WROTE 16 0f the 18 cuts."
2,A lesson in simple math,"Ok, Faithfully has 18 tracks on it...Of these 18 tracks, 5 of them are interludes, and 9 are really bad songs... which leaves 4 wee gems that save this album from being coaster worthy. ""You Gets No Love"" is the bumpin first single that deserves to be next club anthem, this song could potentially throw ""Family Affair"" by Mary J Blige into light rotation. ""Alone in this World"" is very pretty, think a hip hop music box and you'd almost be there. ""Can't Believe"" with Carl Thomas covers all the bases lyrically, musically, and vocally. ""Brand New Man"" is a standout track lyrically. But for the most part, this cd undermines Evan's vocal talents, the songs are lyrically weak and even boring (case in point ""I Love You"")and, sadly, over production of bad songs cannot save this album. Someone at Bad Boy needs to learn that..."
2,Where is the faith???????,"I was so excited when Faith's 3rd album debuted this past Tuesday, so when I came home my husband had surprised me with it because he knows I am a big Faith fan. Well, sorry to say that ""Faithfully"" does not meet the expectations I thought it would. She has a lot more fast songs on her CD this time around. I'm more of a slow song person. I like a couple of the tracks but I end up skipping tracks to get to the ones I like. I still support Faith and will continue to buy her albums when they come out."
1,WAY OVER RATED SINGER.,"This cd just plainly sucks.The production and beats are the same typical beats you would expect from bad boy.She is a mediocre singer and poop diddy simply ruins her album by talking in that ridiculous voice in every other song.I cant believe this beautiful women actually married that fat,ugly crack dealing loser biggie smalls.To conclude,this album stinks and bad boy reeks.DO NOT BUY THIS GARABGE!!!"
5,A Faithful Fan Forever.............,"Faith has a voice that makes her stand out above all the rest. Give her any song and she can sing it faithfully......BET! I love this woman's music! This cd hit home with me. I love every last track on this cd, but the ones that stood out were......#5 I Love You, #10 Don't Cry and The Love Song Interlude.Faith you did a wonderful job with this one girl! Now I gotta have every last cd you made for my collection.I recommend this album to people who wanna listen to some gooooood music!!!! Faith gets five stars easily for this cd Faithfully!!!"
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!! This cd is incredible! I hadn't heard of Faith until last summer when I heard ""Can't Believe"" on the radio. I loved the song and wanted her cd. I waited and waited for a new cd by her with that song out and then ""You Gets No Love"" came out. A few weeks later she realesed ""Faithfully"". I love the album and listen to it when I can. There is hot production by the Neptunes (on ""Burnin Up"") P. Diddy (on ""Can't Believe"" and several other tracks) and by Michealangelo Sardsbury (""You Gets No Love"". I absoloutely love this cd and you don't know what you're missing if you don't buy it!:)"
5,My Role Model,"I love Faith she has inspired me a lot.And Im real glad she is back with ""the first lady"".My fave song is ""you gets no love""."
2,"Sony, we hardly knew ye!","We bought this Sony when our Philips DVD player (circa 2001) started getting finnicky about which DVD's it would play. I thought we'd do a little better with a Sony product. Not only did the Sony lack the Philips features, but it lasted a little over a year before it crapped out completely. I suspect Sony has joined the rest of the world in getting their products made in China, but I failed to check before I threw the box away. Sad that you can't expect durability from anyone. The old Philips player is still going though."
1,Cannot play Disney DVD (and some others),"I bought a brand new Finding Nemo DVD, 3 times, from 3 different places, and the dvd player would have problems playing it. The screen color would fade in and fade out, it was just terrible. I bought another brand new disney cartoon, same problem. The only DDVD i can play without any problem is ""Lord of the Ring"". Man, i will NEVER buy any Sony stuff ....at least not the low end DVD player."
2,doesn't play mp3's or video CD's,recorded by my Sony CDRW drive. Go Figure.Don't expect miracles. It plays DVDs. You get only the basics here.
1,Very Disappointed,"I realize that this is a ""no frills"" player, however, I would expected it to play my DVD's without incident. With this player, I can't play any of my DVD's without blips and the colors fading in and out every few minutes. I returned it to a local store for another one and the second one did the same thing. My DVD's play just fine on my Playstation 2, so the problem is in the player. I wasn't up to trying a third one, so for a little more money, I bought an open box RCA RC6001P. Boy, what huge difference! The RCA plays all my DVD's perfectly, and it has a ""real"" remote control, not a ""only good for a paperweight"" one that came with the Sony."
2,Lived less than two years,"This was a great DVD player when it worked. It lasted less than two years, and I am incredibly disappointed. I bought it primarily on the Sony name. One day, I went to put in a DVD and it made a horribled noise and refused to play a single DVD.This is actually the second Sony DVD player I have owned, and the other one met the same fate. I am not sure if it is just a bum player in a large lot of exceptional ones, or Sony does not make as good products anymore. This Player worked really good when it worked. It gave no warning, just crapped out. I also own a Panasonic DVD player that has outlasted both Sony's, so I dont know that I would buy another Sony. Just be careful and make sure you have a warranty when you purchase one and Good Luck!"
4,Good to have for Stansfield fans,"Lisa Stansfield has a great voice and certainly has had her share of one-off hits. Her career seems to have dulled here in the US, but this disc is a great reminder of what she did really well and what we missed when the US market stopped pushing her so publicly. This includes everything from her early collaberation with Coldcut to her more recent singles and includes a great remix disc of some of her better club-type anthems. Worth a purchase."
4,You could have fooled me,"Congratulations to Joanne Dobson for inventing a 19th century poet so convincingly, she almost had me convinced that Emmeline Foster actually lived. The details of her poor adumbrated life ring true, and her involvement with the desperate, paranoid Edgar Allan Poe had the authentic tragic ring to it. Finding out that she is only a fictional character made me feel diminished a bit, as though history had gotten suddenly a bit smaller.Karen Pelletier's struggles in academia parallel Foster's journey towards artistic creation, and Karen's relationship with her daughter and her family are well observed and wry. I didn't think the Lieutenant whose lips strike her more and more favorably over the course of the novel was all that exciting. But, at least he was there in the clinch. I'll look forward to Dobson's continuing treatment of this relationship, even if not very eagerly. Good work all around, and plenty of fun and suspense."
5,Dreamstreams,"Pure bliss.......Dean Evenson writes some of the most soothing, most healing music on the planet. I have several of his CDs and never tire listening to the tranquil melodies he creates.... Whether or not you meditate, do yoga, or just enjoy pure tranquil melodic melodies, you owe it to yourself to become a collector of this wonderful composer, musician.namaste..."
5,The 2nd best punk band EVER!!,"After Millencolin. These guys are awesome. I own this album, as well as an older one. This band trully knows how to play punk rock, unlike the mainstream punk bands which are spreading around the music scene like a cancer. The CD is awesome, and i strongly suggest getting their early work too. It's nothing like this CD, it's mostly ska, but it's great none the less. MUST BUY if you like punk, real punk not the mainstream horse excrement."
2,There was better to come,"At some point every artist is going to have a somewhat low period, which is nothing unusual, a natural thing to happen, and this album was such for Nektar. Yes ""Tormato"" or King Crimson ""Islands"" would be good comparisons. Not bad, but only fans are going to really like them. So for anyone who is unfamiliar with Nektar and trying to figure out which album or albums to get first, ""A Tab In The Ocean"", ""Remember The Future"", and ""Down To Earth"" are the best choices."
3,3.5 stars,"Part one will lose you. Part two is absolutely smokin'. Sssssizzling, in fact.I suppose you could go ahead and buy it."
4,Noho go away this album is a trip !,"I think i remember another band that had to go to Germany to make it , the Beatles ! , sheesh what a boob this is classic theme rock at its finest , i spent 3 yrs with this in my car 8 track player and still love it 20 yrs later !"
4,This long concept is an ever-green..ok for the remastered CD,"Wow!!This long suite is an ever-green...even though honestly the second half is a bit uneven, in comparison to the first harmonic solutions of this kind of space rock /progressive music.I have always been appreciating their strange blend of space rock music,combined with some experimental solutions within a sort of progressive jazz, for many years!! Then you can add their clever use of power chords at the guitar and a good taste at the piano as well (listen to track #2 for instance), which complete this great debut album...of course the second half-as already explained to you above- is a bit uneven, but the final output is an unforgettable concept album, based upon 2 long songs and for me that's enough!!Check this remastered version out!!"
5,Very soft and Pretty!,I've never thought that faux suede could feel this good. They're very soft and pretty on my bed. I could easily pay $49.99 for this but I paid a great price of $19.99. Way to go Amazon.
3,disappointing,"Mf dooms weakest release, doesn't compare to Vaudeville Villain. The weakest because: length, tons of skits, weak guests appearances, and it seemed like it was just thrown together. The actual cd, package, and booklet reads like an advertisement for Insomniac music and Iz Real, not Viktor Vaughn. Manchild's and Iz Real's verses don't mesh with the album but Poison Pen, Carl Kevorkian, and Kool Keith's verses make the album better. With all the tracks you skip or switch (skits, or guest) the cd lasts 15 minutes. All of dooms rhymes are pretty top notch Viktor V and so was some of the production 3,6,7,10."
3,The worst MF Doom album (Still pretty good),"32 minutes of thrown-together material, of which Doom raps for nine minutes (according to another reviewer - I haven't pulled my stopwatch out). However, since the man also released four no-less-than-amazing rap albums (Take Me To Your Leader, Vaudeville Villain, Madvillainy, MM Food and The Mouse & the Mask) from 2003-2005, this slightly substandard effort can be forgiven."
2,What is goin on here?!..This isn't Vitor Vaughn!,This isn't a full album like the first album (Vaudeville Villain) and it doesn't even hold up to the first album..This album is mostly skits and very crapy over the head futuristic beats with 3-5 songs on it. This is the only MF-DOOM album...well I wouldn't even call this a MF-DOOM album..but anyway this is the only DOOM album that got three spins in my cd player and pc. Don't let my review stop you from buying the album..all I can say is buy it cheap (used) if you can.
3,semi- disappointing,"You know...I didn't expect too much after realization of the length of the album, just about 33 min. Good call on my part. Pro's of the album= it's Viktor, his delivery and skill. Also, am a big fan of Manchild from Mars Ill. Beats are abstract, Doom style. No disappointment here. Con's of the album= way too short, not nearly enough rhyme time. Nonetheless, Vaughn has an ingenius way of making prospective garbage into seemingly ok stuff. Not a must have, however, not a sleep on. Judgement call.P.S. Great Doom albums: Operation Doomsday, Mm...Food."
2,Awful Album but Not Doom's Fault,"Ok, I'm probably the biggest MF Doom fan out there. The guy has never put out a bad piece of work as Doom, Geedorah, M.I.C. Vaudeville. Ever. That is until this one. Not only is this album terribly short but it's filled with inexperienced producers who clearly were not ready for somebody like Doom. It's filled with beats that sound like they're trying to emulate Doom's sound and it doesn't work at all. If you're a Doom completist like me then pick this up. Otherwise avoid at all cost."
5,Digging for gold? Try this mine!,"I find this book to be a very usefull and insightfull introduction to the scene which exists behind our normal work experience.It investigates our basic motivations in serveral areas connected to the field of work. It relates them different to world pictures we can hold. It also dives deep into several main beliefs we normally have about work.In this book, underlying driving forces and fears are brouht up to the level at which one can deal with them in a helpfull manner."
5,Good inexpensive DVD player,"We bought this as a secondary player for our bedroom TV. It's light and easy to use, and has a good picture and sound which is all we care about. We've been using it for about 6 months and have had no problems at all (we've watched at least 30 movies on it). For a simple ""pop in and play"" DVD player, this unit has easily been worth what we paid for it. It looks like this model has been discontinued and replaced by the MDV411, which I can't speak for."
3,Installation Advice,"Either buy a masonry bit that is up to the task, or be prepared to drill 2 smaller pilot holes as the bit supplied in the kit is low grade and makes getting the anchor holes drilled difficult. Also, have a can of compressed air handy to blow the dust out of the drilled holes, otherwise, the anchors won't seat all the way into the hole. Make sure you either have eye protection or you look away before blowing the dust out.Bob Moyer"
3,Not a good fit for me,The quality of the product is good. I did not like the fit as I found the swimwuit did not flow smoothly under the bust but instead it bunched up in a way that I did not like. THE SELLER DOES NOT ALLOW ANY RETURNS ON SWIMWUITS. EXCHANGE MUST BE MADE WITHIN 3 DAYS. THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS FOR EXCHANGE WITH THE ORDER SO BE PREPARED TO TRY ON AND CONTACT THEM IMMEDIATELY IF YOU NEED TO EXCHANGE.
4,One of their better releases,Defenitely taking cue from the bands that have spawned and taken from them. Like in eye of the storm keeping their sound but integrating what they have learned since. Symphonic with an shoegaze feel. (Red Sparrowes who have members of neurosis.)Now when i say shoegaze. Like warm layers of noise with simple fractured chords wrapping you in sheets. Beautiful stuff.
3,coveralls,"The coveralls were fine for my husband, but a little too long. Should have ordered regular length, even though he is 6' tall."
5,Exactly what I ordered!,"I had ordered these coveralls from Sears online...twice! Both times Sears sent me the wrong color. Both shipments from Sears took over a week longer than expected.I ordered them from Amazon.com and they arrived a few days later. And, they were the right color. You really can't ask for more than that."
3,Short sleeve coveralls,"Do not buy short sleeve coveralls they are hard to take off,and can be a real problem in the bathroom when there is no help..."
4,Almost perfect,"There are only three things I would change about these coveralls.1- I am 6'1"", I ordered the 50 Talls and the crotch is still a little tight. 2- The front pockets need to be deeper. I have to leave my keys in my tool box because every time I sit down they fall out of the front pockets. 3- One of the breast pockets needs a place for a pen added to it."
4,brings the flair of an midsummer open air,I especially liked this cd because the songs are all recorded live and it is a summary of all the popular NMA songs.
1,Oh. My. Gawd.,"Not just remakes and live versions of hits, but TRULY BAD remakes and live versions of hits. Note that, among other mind-bogglers, it isn't Baltimora doing ""Tarzan Boy"" it's Biltmore. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
5,Another good '80s compilation,"I think that this is just as good an 80s collection album. But this album takes chances. There's more chance at experimentation here with the well performed songs here like Never Surrender by Corey Hart and Danny Wilson's soulful Mary's Prayer. And the Motels' Only the Lonely is one of the more superb 80s ballads. Arcadia's Election Day still sounds sharp from that onetime outside-of-Duran Duran unit. I still like Shattered Dreams, though it fits well here. For all the more commercial hits like the hit Mickey, the more artistic and stylish songs are are also included in this 20-song album. They put it out in 2001, but it was also a smart time to reflect on the 80s with this effort. Creatively and smartly done here."
4,Has a few problems but all around great.,"I received my purchase within a few days of buying, which I was thankful for. The following weekend I used it on the field. It has some problems keeping up with me, and the sound sensitivity needs to be a bit higher. While I was shooting, the paint balls would occasionally get caught in the neck since the agitator didn't turn on. Other than that, the hopper is great. simple to use. The tilt feature is great, turn your gun right, the agitator turns left and vice versa. I would recommend this product to others, and I will be returning to zephyr sports when I need something again."
4,If buying for a unity candle you will need 2,"I bought this for our unity candle at our wedding, one didn't quite fill up the candle. Ours was an oil lamp candle. So if your unity candle takes lamp oil, you'll need 2."
4,Very soothing,I've listened to this CD hundreds of times. It is very soothing and has a great variety of instruments. Woodwinds are very cool in some songs. I would definetly reccomend this CD to interested people.
4,Magical Nektar,"Though not quite in the same class as ""Remember the Future"" or ""A Tab in the Ocean,"" ""Magic Is a Child"" is in retrospect quite a good album. It contains artmetal mayhem (""Away from Asgard"" and ""The Trucker""), several nice ballads (the title track and ""Listen"") as well as the ethereal ""Train from Nowhere"" (my personal favorite track on the album) and the rocking ""Spread Your Wings."" Roye Albrighton's presence on guitar is definitely missed, but Dave Nelson, perhaps unexpectedly, turns in a fine performance. Great cover art, too!"
3,Growing down,"Leaving teenage years, this spunky prog-pop is high on catchy energy but intermediate on inspired interplay."
5,Relaxing,I can follow my dreams with the relaxing sounds. If you love the ocean you will love this tape!
4,"Good quality pencils, nice set","I am not much of an artist, but it definitely is not because of my pencils! This is a solid set of pencils. It also includes a very convenient carrying bag that will hold more pencils/pens."
5,"Electro""clash"" for people who dont' like Electro""clash""","I should add the line that this CD is also Electro""clash"" for people who DO like Electroclash, in all its forms. The subject field didn't allow enough space for itThis CD removes a lot of the campy NY elements you hear on other compilations and leaves only futuristic but funky tracks. No one-time-then-I'm-bored tunes here -- these tracks I'll be listening to for a LONG time. The last few songs on the disc represent some dark, scary electro -- but that's good! That's what I like to hear, as I normally spin drum 'n' bass.No waste of money here. Buy it. Don't even think about not buying it, as this is one of the best compilations for this genre. The other compilation to get is the 2-disc ""This Is Not the 80's"" which has some of the campier, familiar hits, but intrigued me with its emphasis on more unusual, unfamiliar tracks. It's this strain of hardcore electro that led me to Dr. Lektroluv -- the new face of techno in 2003."
3,Silly Fun,"This is a fun specialty item for the Thomas lover! Retails in store for .99 cents.Positive: FUN, obscure Thomas characters on the box.Negative: Contains palm oil, artificial flavor, milk, egg, and soy."
3,"Good, not great","There are a couple of highlights in this set, but the 2nd disc is a virtual write-off. As a ""celebration"", I expected more from a label that has much to celebrate. These discs should have been mixed. Idle tracks don't allow the listener to get into the flow of the tracks, and many were not created to stand alone.Highlights: Rithma's ""Just Before Dawn""... BIG SMILE, and Ryan Raddon's ""Get Busy"" would make Prince smile, even if it is a little fouffy around the edges."
4,Plug and play,"This was purchased for my 3 year old granddaughter. I was delighted to find it half price at Amazon, compared to what I could find anywhere else. It was easy to install on our computer and my granddaughter was thrilled to be able to ""start her games"" herself. It is truly ""plug and play"" just as described. Even better, when she went to her games online, they were the ones she had been playing all along. The plug and play unit just protects her from leaving the site by accident and finding something she wasn't expecting or possibly interfering with the adults programs. Thanks Fisher Price, great toy. C. Pool"
4,Great way to introduce the internet,"I was skeptical about the easy link, but I'm very happy to have received it. My children love being able to visit their favorite sites, and I take comfort in knowing that that they're 'locked' into that website. If there are other in-site links (such as a shop for the product link), the system will block it. My son loves the site, but also to play with the little characters - they are very durable.The only thing that I was upset about (not affecting the product rating) is that you can find other characters sold through Amazon itself for approx $7-8, not the $20+ that third-party vendors are selling them for. Personally, I found them for anywhere between $1 - $3.50 on an after Christmas clearance. Shop around before spending big bucks."
4,Don't play this while the kids are home...,"Some very funny stuff here and it rocks pretty hard at times. ""Inward Singing"" and ""Drive-Thru"" are hilarious and anyone who hasn't seen the video for ""Track 6"" should check it out on Mancow.com. It's a cartoon by the same guy who did Ren & Stimpy."
5,The Greatest Band In the World,"The D are single-handedly the greatest rock ever. Period. I had this CD the hour it came out, and have not stopped listening to it. Everything on it rocks. Buy it or miss out on the best album of the year."
3,I wanted to love it,"Jack black has such amazing vocal talent. After stumbling across ""Tribute"" on the internet one day I went in search of more of Tenacious D's music. I was so sad with what I found. All of it sounded wonderful, but so crude that I could barely stand to listen to it. I am by no means uptight about crude humor but this was too over the top for me. I am glad that their are so many people that do like it though. They are an amazingly talented band and deserve to be encuraged. I just hope that one day in the future they release some thing a little more toned down."
5,crazy 'arse' rocking music scores,"Tenacious D are truly the funniest comedians rocking. Their CD is side splitting funny but also, full of superbly wonderful music. They truly know how to rock. Jack Black has one 'heck' of a voice. His brother is just as good a musician."
4,History repeats itself,"O.K, O.K... there is no doubt this is a funny album, but lets not EVER forget where this concept came from.... Cheech & Chong!That said, I still highly recommend this album for its great songwriting and sense of humor, that pushes the boundaries of explicit content."
2,"Not the best, but not bad either...","Jack Black is pretty funny, I've got to say, and when I first heard Wonderboy on Conan, it really clicked in my head that Tenacious D was awesome. Now that I have the CD, it turns out that Wonderboy is the only one that I really like. It just doesn't quite have the same feel as when they sing it live."
2,Sell Out,"I've been a big fan of ""The D"" for a couple years now... ever since seeing their HBO shows. In fact, I have even seen them live a couple times. Needless to say, I couldn't wait for this CD.Finally a CD that is a high quality recording instead of the lame bootleg songs from napster!Well, all the songs are there but they have been refined and tweaked so much that I can't even listen to it.The beauty of this duo was their acoustic heavy metal and inside joke of them thinking they were big stars.Now that they are using a full band it just isn't as funny and you can't even enjoy the guitar playing.The in-between comedy bits are kind of funny but all in all it is a major letdown."
2,Hoping for a purer D sound next time,"The D have been the most clever and heartfelt rock band in the world. But their charm lay in their simplicity of tools: two acoustic guitars, two harmonious voices, two wickedly inventive minds,...Now the D's incredible talent has been buried in pretentious rock shlock.Please JB and Rage Cage, release the REAL Tenacious D. Fire the band... get back to your roots and produce your next album without all the lame-rock additions..."
1,I just don't get it.,"I must admit I bought this cd because of one song, Wonderboy. I saw the video on MTV and was intrigued by the humorous lyrics. The rest of the cd just simply left me skipping through track after track. The music sounds the same song after song, and the skits just aren't funny. To me, they are just being crass for the sake of trying to offend the politically correct. Trust me, I'm no damn prude; however, this album is the epitome of teenage, locker room humor.If you want to listen to ""offensive"" music, I would highly recommend Frank Zappa. He is talented, creative, and intelligent. Buy "" Joe's Garage."" Don't buy this album. [...]"
5,Wildly entertaining,"I bought this CD based on the reviews here, and I have not been disppointed. In fact, I'm in love with the songs! ""Tribute"" and ""Lee"" are awesome, and just TRY to get the gorgeously melodic ""Wonder Boy"" out of your head. I dare you! The rest of the album is simply silly, hard-rockin' fun. It will Rock Your Socks off! And the skits in between the songs will definitely make you laugh. ""Drive Thru"" is a crack up! Tenacious D is a delight!"
5,"O, Yeah",This is one of the funniest and hard- rocking albums to come along in a while. With Dave Grohl and Page McConnell playing behind Kyle Gass (or KG) and Jack Black (who is one of the funniest guys in show buiness) this is far by superior to any of that other stuff. LONG LIVE THE D!!!
5,D For the Soul,Tenacious DI've been beating my head against the wall since I first listened to the album. I woke up with a nose bleed after the first night of falling asleeping with the album at full volume on repeat. I have also been able see through walls with tragic results. Great collection of Rock/Thrash/Jam'n Goodness. You want to laugh...you want to cry...you want a new master...you want to rock...you Need the D! It's good for you and your friends. J.
5,This album will rock your socks off!,"Tenacious D is the best band in the world. Not only is the music funny, but the songs are awesome and super catchy. You should also check out some of their HBO shows. The only thing that I didn't like was that the D did not put jesus ranch on the album. Every single song is just so good. No one should go without tenacious d. What are you waiting for, buy the album!"
1,"""The D"" has betrayed its fans!","As a long-time fan of ""The D"" I'm sorely disappointed with this album. First of all, their warm and entertaining ""two ... with acoustic guitars at amateur night"" act is completely lost since they perform their trademark songs with a full studio band, drums and all. The skits are only funny the first time you hear them. After that, it's a chore to listen to the album as you have to keep grabbing the remote to skip the tired skits and get to the next song. The best part of Tribute, the Stairway to Heaven excerpt, has been dumped. Many of their funnier songs aren't on the album: Sasquatch, Bowie, the Star Trek theme with lyrics, and Jesus Christ Superstar. I hope JB and KG read this review and realize how they've betrayed their fans. I'd rather have purchased a compilation of their live club performances or their HBO appearances."
1,This ain't right,"As a fan of the show on HBO, i don't think this album serves the D justice. It just seems like an opportunity to cash in on Jack Black's success and sudden stardom. The songs on the TV show, ""Lee"", ""Explosivo"", ""Tribute"" and others were funny and catchy, but only in their lo-fi, mp3 off of Kazaa-type format. The dual acoustic King Diamond-esque guitar worked on the show. It doesn't work when they pump it up with guest stars from such legendary heavy metal bands as Phish and, GASP (the caustic lords) Foo Fighters. If you were a fan of the show on HBO or downloaded early Tenacious D songs you will not like this album. Unfortunately, it's hard to find the good stuff anymore..."
2,Clever,"See... they're not really good looking, but they sing about how cool and good looking they are and it's really ironic and funny. Get it? They don't look like rock stars, but they talk about how they're rock stars. Get it?It's really hip. Right?See... They're really cool, but they say they're not, so they really are.Be a part of this very exclusive club. Maybe you're ironic and clever enough to get it."
2,The D Is Not My Cup of Tea,"I wasn't exposed to Tenacious D through their HBO bits so I might be a little lacking in perspective. However, I'm a big Jack Black fan from High Fidelity, and all I can say is Tenacious D. is low fidelity for small low-brow kicks. While mildly amusing on first listen, I believe I may have lost a few IQ points with each chuckle. I can't even fathom a second listen, because there's nothing really redeeming about the CD. I'm not a pro-PC guy, but I am pro-intelligence and I'm sorry guys, but how you screw women or screw up songs is not my idea of humor. And, I also expected more from the Dust Bros. production Come on are these the same guys that did Paul's Botique and O'Delay? Any producer could have done this high-gloss job. Pass this one by and make these guys work harder next time around!"
4,tenacious d is cool,"Jack Black sure can sing. But this CD might make you feel a little dirty. I love it though, it's hilarious."
1,Overproduced,"I'm very disappointed. Gass and Black were hilarious doing this same material with just two acoustic guitars. Gass is a talented guitarist, and Black is a talented vocalist, and doing their two-man show, they pulled off a silly/overblown/rock-and-roll-dream schtick that made my wife remark ""oh, their voices are so pretty... but then I heard what they were singing...."" It was priceless.Unfortunately, that charm is lost, drowned out by a vanilla shlock-rock backing that adds nothing and subtracts much. It has converted one of the most interesting music/comedy acts to come out in a while into a something that sounds like bad 80's pseudopunk (e.g. Angry Samoans, Surf Punks, etc.)My only remaining hope is that they follow this up with an ""unplugged"" album."
3,Low Brow Silly - Not a Bad Thing...,"The ""D"" definitely has something... Great music, Great Vocals - many joke bands seriously lack quality chops. But for the ""Over 25"" crowd, who crave more delicious irony and social satire - - an act such as ""Hollywood Superstars"" would better fit the bill. No disrespect to the ""D"" - Rock On."
5,"Yes it is funny, but there is some great playing going on!","Yes this CD is funny, (although watching the HBO specials really helps out) but let us not over look the great playing that goes on throughout this CD. The drumming is awesome, the production is far better than most ""joke"" bands or for that matter better sounding than most serious bands. One could easily replace the silly lyrics and campy breaks (why?) and call this a credible record. That makes this release even funnier because this record is far better than many of the new metal bands that all sound the same, and pout for the camera. Maybe if bands didn't take themselves so seriously more great releases like this would occur. This is not just a funny CD, there is some serious musicianship going on in the songs."
4,"This is not the greatest review, it is just a tribute","JB and KG can rock out, there is no arguing that. I have been watching their series on HBO religiously and cannot get enough. What disappoints me about this record is that it is not completely acoustic which is what I was hoping for. The songs sound good with with percussion and electric guitars, but it is not the D I enjoy so much on tv. It just seems some of the more sublte parts by KG have been glossed over. Still a great cd but it could have been better."
4,"good, but definitely not great","first of all, a lot of people have been comparing jack black and kyle gass to frank zappa. to which i say: frank zappa is not comparable to any artist alive; it'll be a long time before someone like him comes back.tenacious d has some pretty good music on here. i don't like the fact that they cuss every three seconds; that wears off the effect after a while. and any [bad] songs on here (the road is tough), are counterbalanced by the hilarious skits (and who wrote that song? me, baby, ME!)unfortunately, the lyrics are a little uninspired. it seems like every song on this album is about jack black and kyle gass. ah, well. we can't all be social critics like good ol' frank.this cd is definitely worth burning. otherwise, i don't know that i'd buy it. i think that tenacious d will in time make better and more complex albums."
4,Kick A**,"This cd kicks a**! The only reason this cd didn't get 5 stars is that they didn't keep it real. The D went for the full sound of a full band (drums, keyboards, etc...) instead of their signature acoustic jam. If you are debating whether or not to get this cd GET IT, because it beats whatever you are listening to right now. Long Live the D!"
5,The best,"Jack and Kyle are brilliant - this disc never fails to put me in a good mood - if I'm feeling like crap, I just slide this disc in, and laugh my a** off!. It's not even just the comedy, the music is great too - Jack has an amazing voice, and their tunes rock. GIve it up for the almighty D!"
3,"More rock, less talk","JB and KG are very talented musicians. But their comedy skits, unlike their cool music, are not something I need to hear over and over again. Don't get me wrong, they're funny, but I'd rather hear them sing and play than do skits. If they put out another album, I hope it focuses more on tunes and less on comedy skits. The D recently did an appearance on Kilborn in which they sang Friendship with only their acoustic guitars. It was totally righteous, better even than the version on this album."
4,Hilarious,"I kind of hope the members of Tenacious D aren't looking into a series music career. Their comedy is great, but their music is rather lacking. Nevertheless, buy this CD for a hearty good laugh. Who wouldn't laugh at the power to kill a yak from 200 yards away with mind bullets? I know I can't help but laugh at that.Most of the songs on this CD are just flat out zany and amusing; with only a few that sound like they were trying to be serious (they fail at this miserably). They've got the humor bit down, but as for music, eh, they might want to just stick to the humor. Great CD though."
4,tenacious d,"The band is Tenacious D, this being their first album it is also named TENACIOUS D. It could fall into the genre of rock and that is generally where i put it. When you listen you hear the great and hysterical lyrics of Jack Black and the guitar playing of his brother Kyle Gass. I'd have to say that it is definately one of my favorite bands. I would recommend this band to anyone who is looking for music that doesnt have to be taken seriously. some of their best tracks are ""tribute,"" ""wonderboy,"" and ""FHG."" The music does hve some language that parents wouldnt enjoy their kids listening to, but if your not a kid with controlling parents it's a great band. This is their first album so its hard to compare with other works, but they have released their dvd set that has all of their songs presented in concert and it has short videos and the HBO specials that they made."
4,Hilarious CD! But too many songs are too short!,"I know I shouldn't even THINK about Tenacious D havin' a serious music career (stick to the act'n Jack, eh?) but there's only ONE thing I have a problem with this CD, and that's some of the songs that weren't released as singles are far too short. I'm not saying I think an album should have real long songs on them, but c'mon they could've at least extended some of 'em to about, let's say THREE minutes? Two 'n a half tops? Oh well, I'll stop being bitchy. To summarise, really funny album and worth the money (if you see it for a good price, that is...) Jack Black & Kyle Gass are an inspired comic duo with incredible acoustic guitar playing skills!Flawed, but great fun to listen to!"
4,Catchy Little Tunes!!,"Say what you will about The D, but when it comes to writing short 1 minute songs about one's own awesomery they cannot be beat. Songs like Tribute and Kyle Quit The Band are hardly 2 minutes but will have you humming them the rest of the day. The catchy melodies and hilarious lyrics make this just one sweet mix of folk, comedy, and rock. Although, there is alot of swearing Jack Black is one of those rare people who can swear all day but never offend. He has a fun, jovial tone that makes his F-bombs seem enjoyable rather than tawdry. Check this out if you have any curousity in the mystery that is Tecacious D."
4,Actual Genuine Music!,"Jack and Kyle are obviously having a ball. Though clearly self-indulgent, they take this self-indulgence to the level of art form. Adolescent only in that it is pot and sex driven, this music has a heart and a genuineness that is most certainly art. While the music and content do become repetitive, one stays truly charmed throughout the album, willingly hanging on for dear life until the next gem presents itself. Everyone I talk to who knows this album becomes really happy at its mention. My only serious complaint would be the poor production value. This music is meant to be played LOUD, but it is impossible to reach the level of satisfaction without the music becoming muddled and unlistenable. At times the volume levels of the sketches drop off the map. I hope the boys get enough juice off this to get a better producer for next time."
5,Tenacious... definitely! D... I suppose.,"Jack and Kyle have made it. Though they have other musical accompanyment they're still kicking it hard and fast with sasquatchal delight. If you liked their past performances but were bummed because... or... only had dumbed down versions that were low quality and incomplete then buy this mutha, homes. Its got it all and more.Sasquatch"
4,With karate i'll kick your.....,This is hilarious CD. JB and KG impressed me. Very funny guys with some great skits. Just take it for what it is and try not to analyze it.
3,"O Ween, Where Art Thou?","This is a funny album, full of laffs galore. It will appeal to listeners who haven't heard of Ween, and so think that the sounds they are hearing are brand new.This is Ween's stumpy, famous younger brother. The idea of taking rock ballads and '70's concept rock and making it funny has been done by Ween for decades now.Nevertheless. Good for a laff or two."
5,A masterpiece,"I first saw them on SNL and thought nothing of it. Then, I saw it again and looked them up on the internet. I found a bunch of live mp3's, downloaded them, made a cd, and have been laughing ever since. This album doesn't take too much away from the original format of their songs--it only adds to it. Dave Grohl's drums are great, as usual, and Kyle's playing is much better then you'd expect. Strictly for those who know how to laugh...and ROCK!"
4,"the album's great, but...","...if you weren't already a fan of the d before you heard it, i doubt you'd be converted. for some of their truly inspired stuff, i recommemd you download a few tracks recorded by fans from their live shows."
5,Great album,This album is hilarious and the music is excellant. A truly great album that you will enjoy over and over.
3,Tenacious D Music CD,"This CD is at times hilarious and musically impressive. I only became interested in it b/c someone showed me the ""Tribute"" video - that one song was enough for me to purchase it. Well, that and I'm a big J.B. fan (and the CD was only $3+S/H).I would characterize it as acoustic thrash, peppered with comedy bits in/between the songs. Most songs are short, but I am happy with the number of songs. I tend to FF the bits when I'm in the car, but i listen to the whole shlmeal when i'm just fartin' around on the computer. Some of the songs are down-right smashing (Tribute, City Hall, Wonderboy) and Drive-Thru & Inward Singing are ROFL good. My personal fave is Double-Team (yes, it's what you think it is).Think of this album as if Spinal Tap did an acoustic session album like Led Zeppelin III and you're pretty close."
4,Most Excellent Band,I think that this is one of the most awesome bands. Tenacious D Rocks!!! JB and KG are gonna rock your socks off!!
5,Prepare to have your socks rocked off,"This is some funny stuff. Jack Black and Kyle Gass have great senses of humor and it translates well into the musical treat that is the ""D"". Not only is this disc hilarious, but the music in itself is very good. Some of these songs on the cd are the funniest things I have heard in a long time. Hoepfully some sort of live DVD release will follow. Long live the ""D""."
4,Musical and Funny = great CD,"Tenacious D is hilarious. Their skits are really funny, as are their songs. Each skit is great: not one misses the mark and they also are nice and short: not too much commitment, which means you can listen to each skit that much more. From ""Inward Singing"" to ""One Not Song"" this album will have you peeing in your pants...while singing!And the best part about Tenacious D? They are talented musicians. The songs often have really cool guitar parts. As many people have stated, they could definetly pass as a rock group.The vocals. Wow. Jack Black has, jokes aside, one of the best rock voices I've ever heard. He sounds great. And the harmonies, like on ""Tribute"" and ""Wonderboy"" sound awesome (both are awesome songs too).Lastly, the only bad thing about this CD are one or two tracks that don't last the test of time. ""Lee"" and ""Explosivo"" being two prominent offenders, but they're still decent.The comedy draws you to this album, and the music keeps you there."
3,Dont be fooled...,"Funny but not as funny as one might think. I laughed (...) but it got kind of old. The humor is not necessarily in the words-its in that they made a cd of that stuff. JAck Black can sing, though, and Kyle GAss can play. (...)"
3,Drunken Dio and other power metal songs.,"Ok first off Jack Black's music sounds like a drunken version of songs from Uriah Heep, Dio, Blind Guardian, Manowar, Hammerfall, Helloween, and Primal Fear and that is why I like it. However I can't pull myself to give this neither 4 stars nor 5 stars. It's on par a good comedy album but if I really wanted insane comical power metal or comical metal I'll go with the bloodletting of Gwar. Good try Jack I look forward to your next album though. Through in some songs about bodily dismemberment and I'm yours dude."
2,"Okay, but don't believe the hype","Okay folks, I've listened to the cd a couple of times, and there's a reason that the cd has already dropped off the Billboard 100. Its funny, yes, but its not music. The songs, while mildly amusing, have no endearing qualities, except maybe ""F... her Gently"" and the radio single ""Wonderboy"". The comedic sketches seem forced and silly, and the satanic undertone as well as the ridiculous satanic artwork will keep this band from ever being taken seriously. Jack Black is very funny in the movies, but I hope his idea of Tenacious D., aka ""Two Jerkoffs With Guitars"" is a short lived one.If you're looking for serious acoustic musicianship, check out ""Live at Luther College"" by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds. I guarentee it will be more useful in your cd player than Tenacious D, which should be used as a beer coaster or frisbee."
2,Not that Funny,"I'm not sure why I broke down and bought this; maybe because I kept hearing how HILARIOUS it was. But to me, this just sounds like the Barenaked Ladies with swear words. Recommended if you are into Kid Rock, wrastlin', and Mancow.(I did give this two stars because it was great to hear Nirvana's drummer is working again.)"
1,This is not Music! It is totally horrific!!!!!,"I'm sorry Jack Black but you were a good actor in school of rock. But music is just not your area. This Cd is completely the worst thing i have ever heard. If you want to hear some real music that Jack Black was in then listen to the song in the movie: school of Rock, in the beginning of the movie. That's music, but this is just filth.If this is supposed to be rock like one reviewer said then why dont i hear any rock and roll riffs. This is horrible. Whoever gives this more than 2 stars has no taste whatsoever in music.Please Jack Black, come to your senses and make some real music. This is not living up to your potential. I've been playing guitar for only a year and a half and i can say this as a fact that i have more talent than everyone in this entire band. Its sad but its true. Guys come to your senses and stop jerking around. Make some real music for christ sake!!"
4,Everybody Knows.,"The D don't let you down. It'd be well nigh impossible for The D to let you down. It's just not in their DNA. Some thoughts on the CD..'Explosivo' should have stayed acoustic. Adding all the instrumentation just made it sound like a novelty song and I stress to you, dear reader, that The D is NOT a novelty act. 'Wonderboy' would be lodged in the Billboard Top 5 right now, but most of America hasn't removed that corn-cob from their rear so that they might free up space in their ears. It's their loss. 'Friendship' should appeal to all those power-pop junkies out there, those Big Star and Raspberries vinyl snobs. 'Karate' is an oh-so-short but how-very-sweet lovesong for your worst enemy. And 'Double Team' is the incredible God-Like rockfest that no one on earth can do better. Sex supreme indeed."
5,Better than Sandler,"If you like Adam Sandler (I do) then Tenacious D will be a huge step up. The songs sound thought out, instead of just the first three chords they could think of, like Sandler. Don't get me wrong, Adam Sandler is funny, but The D is just better in the musical department."
4,Some Nice Music Here,"I bought the four songs I liked: Barbarellas, World Exclusive, New Haven, Signals In Smoke. I especially like the synth landscapes of Barbarellas and Signals in Smoke. World Exclusive has a great grove and New Haven reminds me of, believe it or not, The Byrds.Interestingly, my fav. solo John Taylor song, ANON, would've fit perfectly in this set.I wish there were an instrumental version of BARBARELLAS --it's a wash of synth bliss. I wasn't surprised knowing Rhodes' influences Kraftwerk, Bowie's LOW, etc."
5,The Rockies,"I love the Rockies sound and this is the cd (of the three I bought) that I receive the most comments on. People really love the sound and find it so relaxing. Very professional and a must for massage therapists, or just to go to sleep to."
3,So so,Was disappointed that all the tracks seemed to be exactly the same. Didn't think it particularly sounded like Colorado. Could have been recorded anywhere...particularly with the cow noises. Might be appropriate for massage if running water doesn't bother you.
2,More wrinkles than I've ever seen!,"I bought these sheets and pillowcases in Queen size, paying more than the clearance price they're now selling for. I slept on my pillow one night and in the morning it was covered with wrinkles, as though it had been stuffed into someone's sock overnight. The wrinkles do not come out with smoothing. I bought this relatively expensive set of sheets as part of a budget bedroom makeover. I am totally disappointed. The pillow cases are supposed to be on top of the bed, matching my rose afghan, looking sleek and welcoming. Instead they look like they've never been laundered - I truly have never - ever - even with the cheapest pillowcases I've ever bought, seen something that gets SO FULL OF WRINKLES and looks so AWFUL."
5,Great!,"I was a little leary when I first bought this DVD because I had never really heard any of the bands, but it was great! My only complaint is that they didn't actually burn the house down haha, but the very end of it was really symbolic, at least in my mind. Good DVD showing good talent. 5 stars."
2,Not my cuppa,This is a rambling book that needs to be tightened up for my tastes. Hard to describe but it just seems too vague and general.
2,crap,"I have everything you can think of go wrong with this notebook. From the screen to the battery. Not only does this notebook get extrememly hot, but the overall performance or lack there of is not the best. I would look for another notbook from other manufactures other than HP or Compaq."
1,Not Even Worth $1,"A very bad laptop. The A/C adapter socket has died twice so far(after having been sent back to be fixed). The screen flickers constantly. Upon taking the laptop out of the packaging, you learn that the hibernation mode does not work and that the manufacturer recommends that you turn off all standby modes to prevent the system from freezing. It gets very hot very quickly and is extremely heavy. It's got lots of nice, blue-lit shortcut buttons for playing DVDs, except the DVD drive doesn't really work (gets very loud and is extremely slow). A good laptop to get if you like to trade in for a new one every six months or so."
2,Mostly a Piece o' Crap,"Worst laptop I've ever owned. Runs too hot to put on your lap, shuts down daily (hard freeze), CD/DVD too noisy to comfortably watch DVDs, AC connector broken twice, have had to pay $600 in repairs, HP wouldn't honor warranty. It's a heavy desktop replacement, but can't replace a desktop. Video drivers have never worked right, continuous crashing on video drivers or modem (even when not using). Memory parity erors. I would rather revert to pen and paper than to ever again own an HP laptop. Total piece of crap. A total lemon, and HP should be ashamed."
4,Not my favourite translations of Issa,"I am a great admirer of Issa's and I had great expectations when I bought ""The Dumpling Field"". However, I found I was quite disappointed with the translations. As far as I can judge they have great academical merits, but I find them slightly dull. The translations are very matter of fact and I miss the esprit I have come to associate with Issa. The good thing about the translations is that they are kept abstract and as short as possible, and probably they are very close to the Japanese original in content, but they lack some of the tenderness and poetry I have seen in other translations, both Swedish and English."
5,Bilal's Continued Artistry,"In the Beast Trilogy, Enki Bilal has maintained the level of artistry that I discovered in my first readings of Metal Hurlant, as published in France from the 1970's. The artist also delivers a satisfying science fiction yarn, retaining the socio-political commentary that typified most of Hurlant's graphic tales."
1,Buy in it a store.,"This is probably the kind of thing that one should buy in a store. In my case, the can arrived from Amazon with the lid very much ajar and with sticky, smelly fluid making a terrible mess. The can is such a mess of caked gooey pruning fluid that I can't even pick it up, much less try to use it."
4,Did the job; worked well.,Why use it? The tree needs it. It keeps it from peeling and further deterioration. It contains enough for several applications.
2,Too western,"This is a decent intro to the music of the Middle East and the Maghreb in that it incorporates a variety of styles, but I think the Putomayo CDs are better and less commercialized. I'd recommend those to anyone interested in arabic music."
3,Kind of disappointing,"I love world music and Putumayo CDs.I also loved that Desert Rose song and the amazing voice of Cheb Mami with Sting.I bought this CD expecting a sexy ""One Thousand and One Nights"" music style, or a good fusion of traditional and modern sounds, but instead, what I got was a KITSCH POP version of arabic songs.Some of the songs are just bad taste, you just want to forward them as quickly as possible.I should have guessed just by the look of the cover. It reflects the music as well. The painting might be nice, but the mix with the modern computer added photo image and the strange balls of roses just don't work well together. The same goes for the songs.I don't recommend it, unless you're looking for cheesy disposable pop."
3,Great for parties.,This is a fun CD. Dancing to Arabic new music. Good selection. Great for parties.
2,Disappointing,"Not very thrilling or exciting. So, try to listen to all the songs first before you make the investment. My sincere suggestion."
5,An excellent introduction to Arabic-influenced music,"I truly enjoy this album and disagree with those who do not feel it was worth the investment. Definitely a great introduction to Arabic cross-over music for those with a western palate. The song ""Mon Amie La Rose,"" originally by Franoise Hardy, is so moving. Definitely check out the sample above. Natacha Atlas is divine. Several of the other songs like ""Inchallah"" stand out. But more than that, the compilation is pleasant and has good energy."
5,Intoxicating and Exotic,"Make an appointment for a massage and bring this CD along!You can almost taste the exotic spices of the Middle East while listening to it .I'm a Latina and have always loved Middle Eastern music!I find it exotic, sensual and intoxicating!My favorites in this CD are :MON AMIE LA ROSA = TOTALLY exotic and sensual !INCHALLA = This one goes deep into the soul with its happy energy !ESMA YALLI= Wow! I'd love to have Hakim sing this one for meon my birthday! While I dance with veils in the deserts of Egypt!QALANTIGA= Rachad Tahib has SUCH a manly sensual voice!Sexxyyyy!Plus the music is full of aroma and exotic spices!I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this one!This CD is wonderful ! I wish I could understand the Arabic language !It sounds beautiful to my ears !Thank you to all the singers that contributed to this CD!BUY IT you're going to love it! I must had been from the MiddleEast in another life!!!!!No wonder I LOVE this music!"
4,Great for Belly Dancers!!!!!!,"This CD of various artists is perfect for any performing belly dancer. It has a wonderful variety of moods, tempos, and styles. There are a couple songs, that go into American dialect, which didn't work for me; but the rest is GREAT!!! :)"
1,"Mix down the vocals, and maybe","I loved Arabesque and Arabian Travels, but this is not trance. This is more like Arabian pop music. The vocals are irritating to me. Sting even shows up on one track. If you are looking for world trance, or something to chill out or relax to, forget this one."
4,"Hardy, not Piaf","Entertaining collection, good to keep you going for an overheated dance floor or repetitive exercise (treadmill, jogging). I did find the dance beats annoying after a while, but I suppose that's a generic complaint about the appropriation of world musics for wide consumption and dancing. A brief murmur about the notes: the opening track is not a reimagining of the ""ache of Edith Piaf."" The number was originally by Francoise Hardy--they've confused ""Mon Ami La Rose"" with ""La Vie En Rose""; both wonderful but in very different ways."
4,Quality Scratcher,This is the best type of scratcher to get. It doesn't leave fragments like carpet or cardboard does. Very clean.
3,PAL,PAL IS A FORMAT THAT IS ONLY USED IN EUROPE.YOU CAN CERTAINLY PLAY THE CD. YOU CANNOT PLAY DVD. YOU HAVE TO SOMEHOW GET A PAL DVD PLAYER. ONLT NTSC IN USA. THIS WEB SITE DOESN'T MENTION THAT. IT'S NOT KETAMA'S FAULT
2,WONDERFUL,I used this CD during labor to help me relax. It worked great!! The nurses even liked it. My daughter and I now listen to it during the day to create a peaceful environment.
5,A Thrilling Thriller,"Jack Valentine is a self-doubting, semi-super hero of sorts in the Jim Rockford (Rockford Files) genre. Middle-aged Valetine is a likeable and unwilling secret agent--a cross between Sam Spade's earthiness and James Bond suave. He is also very intuitive (a good quality for his profession)and unlike Mr. Bond who spends his enroaching middle-aged years shaking martinis and womanizing while he dodges bullets, Jack Valentine is preoccupied with his boat and art collection while he sails the wild Irish north sea and takes out the bad guys. The Sirius Crossing is full of exciting, unexpected twists and logical, if somewhat bizarre conclusions. Most importantly, it is a really good story. I will read it again. And again."
3,Doesn't engage,"Set in Ireland our hero, Jack Valentine, a cross between James Bond and 22 SAS, takes on one last job. This involves locating a body that was buried in Northern Ireland in the 70's ,one that should not have been there and recovering a package.Along the way he enlists the help of loyalists and provo's alike as well as most intelligence agencies around the world. It does have a great sequence involving a channel crossing in a stormIt is far fetched, very , but very readable. Its well written, Creed is the pen name of Eoin McNamee. Worth the effort but I did'nt enage with the characters at all but as it only cost me fifty cents at a book fair complaining would be miserable in the extreme."
2,Ian Fleming Steel Dagger Award winner,"Jack Valentine is a British agent who accepts the mission to locate the body of an American agent in Ireland, killed in 1974, and remove whatever papers are on it. He is joined by an old friend of his, Liam Mellows, wanted as a possible informer by the IRA. Both getting the papers off the dead body and keeping a step ahead of Liam's pursuers is beginning to get more and more of an impossible task.This winner of the newly formed CWA Steel Dagger Award for thriller writing is actually a dull, dreary and dreadfully slow read. There are moments of sheer terror. However, the concentration is on realistic characterizations with great depth. The author succeeds in that regard. The characters lack true empathy which leads to apathy. The bottom line is that as a thriller THE SIRIUS CROSSING simply doesn't thrill."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS IRONING BOARD!,"I bought this one in Bed, Bath & Beyond. The cotton cover is so thin that it tore within a month of use and the thin, cheap foam pad moves around and bunches up. To make matters worse, you cannot get a cover for it anywhere, including Polder!! I told BB&B that they are selling an ironing board that they do not sell a cover for and that you cannot get a cover for. There are Polder covers, but they are either too long or the pull cord is on the wide end and does not fit between the board and the iron holder on the end. After spending a lot of time looking and so much frustration, I returned it for a Rowenta model."
3,A Pilgrim Guide to Christian Rome,"I found this book useful in my visit to the city of Rome. This is intended as a guide for the Christian faithful to the eternal city. The book is divided into five parts, namely: I. Rome, Civitas Domini, II. Rome, City of Martyrs and saints, III. Rome, Cult of the virgin, IV. Rome, City guarded by angels V. Rome, City of Popes and jubilees. This division, of course is arbitrary. The history of the Church in Rome is well portrayed through its significant works of art, monuments and churches. It contains very useful maps, illustrations and photographs. But as a reference book I found it rather hard to use."
5,Difficult things,"Thinking is difficult, and meditation is difficult, and meditative silence over a long period of time is very difficult, because we are in a society which doesn't allow for any of this. Television, movies, sports, all fill our brains and have done so since the 1950s. So to read a book for one's benefit which was written before that time is to enter a privileged world, a deep silence. I highly recommend this to anyone who desires to know God and himself better. I was not upset by either the writing style (which I thought very readable) or the Biblical innacurracies (the Mary things are debatable, and in all else, this was an incredibly Biblical book) but was challanged by the whole premise of repentance. Protestants gave up Confession long ago, and most Catholics only recently. Yet Christ says, ""Unless you repent . . ."" Maybe that's what's wrong with the world."
1,Unsafe!,"The torch started malfunctioning after a few months. I would turn the valve off but the flame wouldn't go out for several seconds or even longer. This gradually got worse, i.e. it kept burning longer and longer even after turning it off. It reached the point where I considered it unsafe and threw it away.The controls and buttons to light the torch feel flimsy. This could be the root cause."
1,Piece of crap,"Bought this item back in Feb. Used it once, now it won't even light. Yes it has gas in it, but will not ignite."
1,Not the item that was advertised,The item was not the same as what is in the picture above. What ships is a tiny cigarette lighter.
2,Forgettable,"I had a feeling I was going to get here and find lots of people that really enjoyed this book. I thought it was boring. The main characters had little substance and it was a little farfetched that the president, while in office, had not only had a girlfriend but a baby with that girlfriend and not once in the ensuing 30 years did it ever get leaked to the press. The big climax at the end of the book where Dina meets killer was about as exciting as eating a cold bowl of oatmeal. Not even when Simon the sleuth came to the rescue. It was silly. Sorry."
3,"Fair, at best.","The dialog was stiff, the chemistry between the two main characters non-existent,and the book could have been reduced by 90 or 100 pages and still told the story."
3,"Entertaining plot, Well written characters, quick read","I got this on a whim. I enjoy fictional stories about conspiracy at high levels, this seemed like a good fit. I don't like reviews that give away the ending, so I won't go into great detail. However, one of the main characters, Simon, has the task of writing a memoir for Graham Hayward, past President of the U.S., for the purpose of transferring positive memories of him onto the son, who is planning a presidential bid.No surprise here, but the supposedly unblemished reputation of the President is uncovered. The ease of this discovery is surprising though, especially since it's been covered up for 30 years, and one visit to a rambling Alzeheimer's patient reveals the truth.However, while somewhat predictable, I have found this book a captivating page-turner, and the characters are well written and explored fairly thoroughly. I'm looking forward to more of this author's work."
3,Mediocre...,"""The President's Daughter"" wasnt a bad book,but it wasnt great either. The characters had absolutely no chemistry. I felt that the label of ""romantic suspense"" was misleading. There was ABSOLUTELY NO romance in this story. All in all, I'd say that this book was pretty forgetable. I wouldnt recommend it."
1,My dogs didn't really like the whole idea!,"I didn't find this book so useful. My dogs refuse any otherkind of food except their freshly cooked chicken i prepare for themevery night. Although I tried to follow some advises from this book, I saw that they prefer to starve than eat anything else.I thought they would die since they didn't eat anything for 2-3 days and gave up! The author insists that it's a matter of time that your dog will get used to the new diet, but I see that it is not. I think it has to do with the personality of each and every dog, and that's the reason I will never get a book like this. They don't change their nutricion no matter what I do, so I prefer buying books which deal with their psychological world and ways to communicate with them, instead of books which actually waste my time reading them."
4,review from a master mason,"i just read this book and really enjoyed it. it can get a little dry at times, but the overall content is excellent. i think this book will help all newly made masons to understand the craft."
1,One of the Worst Books on Freemasonry EVER,"Ole' Manly Hall must've mixed his medications the day he cranked this baby out. You just know he was one of those guys who sat around during the 60's trying to figure out how to play Beatles albums backwards. Incredibly disappointing, particularly when compared to his Secret Teachings of All Ages. These Keys should've stayed lost. Avoid at all cost."
2,Bland,"I'd purchased this because I thought it contained a song that was until now unnamed on my iPod (it was on a CD I got from my dad). I did find the song I was looking for later. The music on this CD, I found to be quite bland, like what you'd hear in a dentist's office elevator."
4,A good overview,"The book is over 400 pages long so of course I haven't finished it. But I started with the chapter that applies to my job. The priciples are the same, but things have changed a bit in 10 years. That said, the book is still very helpful. I hope that one day the authors will update the book, which would be a very time consuming task. I have not found a better book so far. If anyone does, please reply to my review."
3,Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology,This book is written as college course text. It is easy to understand if you have a good techincal background. It does a good job of covering the many different aspects of the difficult subject.
4,"Specs wrong, heads up","Just an FYI: The specs are for a device it connects to, not the power adapter being sold.""Product Features* Effect Types - 47* Effect Modules - 8* Patch Memory - User 40+, Preset 40* Sampling Frequency - 96kHz* A/D Conversion - 24-bit""If there's a power adapter out there that will do sound sampling I want it. Especially at $30."
4,Handy Tool,"The KD TOOL 492 OIL-SEAL REMOVER&INSTALLER got the job done for me. If you have never used this product it might take you several minutes to understand them since the illustrations arent too clear but I'm sure if you have the technical know-how to get to the point of being able to use this product, you can figure it out. The only issue I had was the seal slipping out of the chinese fingers, but I got past that by anchoring the seal with a piece of thin wire (ie staple or paper clip) to the fingers, securing the seal until you get the other end through. I used it with a rope seal on a F4-134 engine. Beats having to remove the engine out and all of that mess."
2,oil seal remover,The kit came with NO instructions.The seal griper will not grip the rope seal.But the rasor will work for a gasket scraper.
5,"""ONE OF THE BEST.............","This one of the best album by Fred. I really enjoy listening to my cd everday, as a pick-me-up to get me through the day. I especially like track 14, not only as a great song, but also giving support a hometown artist(Memphis) on the rise!!!!!!!!!"
4,gypsy sorcery and fortune telling,"this book holds extensive knowledge and overview of many romany cultures, from beginning to end a compelling and informative read and reference book."
1,one star compared to his previous album,"nothing wrong with this album, it just doesn't hold it's own against ""welcome to my dream"". like a previous review stated, it may be hard to find, but well worth the effort."
4,"Nice piece of work, but definately different.","If you like ""If I only had a brain"", and ""Tiptoe through the inferno"" do not hesitate to go out and buy MC 900's previous CDs ""Hell with the Lid off"" and ""Welcome to my Dream"""
4,MC 900 ft Jesus...Beat Poet,"This is cool...like something from the fifties brought to the nineties. Not as good as ""Welcome to my Dream"" but still very good. Jazzy , surreal rap that gets under your skin. Sharp wit, sharp tongue and hip music. Very humorous. Too bad this guy (Mark Griffin) didn't make it in the music world...we need artists like this. I wondered what happened to him. I""ve had Welcome To My Dream, since it's release about 1990, didn't know this existed. If you like this stuff give it a listen."
5,One of my favorite albums,"This would be my third or forth copy since 1994. This album is what got me hooked on MC 900 in the first place. If you like your hip-hop with a funky, jazzy, twist and a very unique sound, you too will love MC 900 Ft. Jesus."
3,Pleasing but not cleanching,"You can tell this was one of his early works. It is enjoyable to read, if you like the author but don't go out of your way to acquire it. Character development okay and story line okay. Not great, just go get it at your library, I did."
1,The cover art is better than the text,"Evil scientists, a computer that thinks he's the Antichrist, and a woman running around outside naked. It was slow, depressing, and dreadful. It made me want to swear off Chalker forever, but by this time I had already purchased a large selection of his repertorie because of the interesting covers. As youth is wasted on the young, wonderful cover art is wasted on Jack Chalker."
3,A turning point,"Fifteen years ago, Adam Thorne participated in a Halloween prank that resulted in a man's death. Now, he's a successful cardiologist in Baltimore who is rapidly falling in love with the dead man's daughter, Kasey Delaney, who owns her own floral shop. Can she forgive and forget and find love with Adam?There are some excellent points made on forgiveness. Could God forgive Adam and the others who pulled the prank? Remember that God forgave David his sins of adultery and murder involving Bathsheba and her husband, Uriah; he also forgave Paul (formerly Saul), who was an accessory to the stoning of Stephen.My only complaint is that they meet and barely weeks later, they're courting. I had this same compliant with Lough's other book ""Suddenly Home"". Most people do not fall in love that quickly; that's infatuation."
5,what?,"This is Erie Lake Effect HC from Christcore giants xDxAD & Dodgin Bullets. This is good. You -- the buster who thinks this is Transformer propaganda -- are bad. Album: good. You, the buster: bad. Any questions, Optimus Prime? I didn't thinks so. Don't buy this here: buy it at a cheaper price from Facedown Records & support hard hitting Christian music.Postscript: I don't hate you, Transformer buster. I just hate what you do to yourself."
5,Awesome!,"You gotta be kidding me. This is some of the most CATCHY stuff Ive heard in a while. The Transformers theme is not for fans of the once great cartoon. If these guys are still together, I cant wait to buy their next CD. This is INDEED hardcore music. I highly suggest this album, if you like heavy brutal music."
1,Listen to the first reviewer,"The worst piece of Transformers ""merchandise"" I've ever heard... this is a shame to all fans. Sorry folks, but even the very hardcore TF fan can't take this.I hope a real television soundtrack is to be released someday..."
1,Embarrassment to the Decepticon logo,"In a blatant attempt to pull in Transformers fan, a garbage band has used not only the logo but several of the licensed names of Transformers for their songs on this CD. Just listen to the samples, the disc is trash. Hardcore music? I think not. More like hardcore crap. Mick Foley is hardcore, drinking milk a week after it expired is hardcore, this CD....is not hardcore.Long live the Transformers!"
1,CHEAPLY MADE,Dffinately dosent fit like a 3x...more like a 1.5x (lol) and is pretty cheaply made for the price...olus they charge a restocking fee which is bogus...!
3,Predictable but fun,"Good message, doesn't hit anyone over the head with overt proselytizing, good mystery, fun and quick read for an afternoon."
3,Disrespectful to the Gibson bass,"I wrote a email to Bacon and Moorhouse detailing my reasons for the above title. I own alot of Gibsons and Epiphones been playing out and in for over 30 years. They talk very little on the great Gibsons and the large list of known players of Gibsons, they pretty much state that the Tbird was all Gibson could do right. If i could have looked at it before buying I wouldnt have bought it. Should have been called ""The Fender Bass Book"", uninformed or definitely biased big time."
1,"Resolution claim is deceiving, quality is poor","Quality is poor, doesn't come close to other 640x480s. I should have read these before I purchased, mine is going back in the morning."
1,Very bad product,"Its been two days I've had this web-cam. Very dissapointing... I literally need to sit under a table lamp to to be able to see any pictures clearly. Under normal light, the recording is too dark -- to be visible.I'm dumping this and buying a logitech tomorrow... Its not even worth 10 bucks."
3,"Great size, decent quality","If your looking for high quality, don't purchase any tiny camera. If your looking for a compact cam for your laptop, this fits the bill. I was initially disappointed in the quality (especially in low light situations), but the practicality of the camera has started to earn its keep. I use a lot of WiFi connections in public places (i.e. airport, college campus) and would rather not hook up large, intrusive camera's. I can hook this badboy on the top of my laptop with little to no notice. For my needs, this camera has been great."
4,Good boot for the price,"I got a good deal on these, so I was happy. They look good (esp. with jeans), and seem to run true-to-size (perfect length and maybe a little wide). The boots were surprisingly comfortable, esp. since I'm not used to a thick heel. The sole is very sturdy and the seams are triple stitched, but don't expect the thickness or support of a heavy-duty work boot like Carolina or Chippewa.Here's the odd part: I bought a black pair from another site and liked them so much that I bought the brown ones on Amazon when the price was right. But the first pair I bought has noticeably thicker leather than the recent pair. The new ones are great for casual wear, but I doubt the leather would hold up if used as real work boots. If you get a good price, I'd still recommend them----but my ""4 star"" rating includes a good price. At full cost, I wouldn't rate them so high."
4,Another victim of the Marketing Beast,"Such a shame that great cd's like this never get publicized like they should. I never even knew this existed until I happened to come across it in a store. It's a great cd, with tight production and the best lyrics I've heard from Serv-On in a while. I think the move off No Limit helped him refocus. I recommend picking this up on sight, as it is worth every penny. I especially liked the intro dedicated to the victims of 9/11.R.I.P. Big Ed."
5,Archtypical late-70's Rock/Pop Band,"This is the only album by New England of which I am aware, but it typifies the music of the end of the 70's. There were at least two songs from this album which made the charts, but the entire album is very good. The group toured shortly after the album hit the charts, but then disappeared -- as many of the ""one-hit wonders"" did at the time."
4,new england,"this was one of new englands best albums, aside from explorer suite witch was also very solid, despite getting airplay they never really got reconized, but they were one of the best out there that the critics never discovered... gene simmons from kiss gave them their start and got there albums on a record label, he also helps with some of there songs youll find his name on a couple of there albums... it is worth listening to again and again...."
5,GREAT HARD GUITAR AND STRONG VOCALS,"I HAVED THE ALBUM SINCE THE EARLY 80'S AND SINCE I'VE HAD A CD PLAYERS SINCE THE LATE 80'S I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE CD. THIS IS A GREAT SET OF SONGS YOU CAN LISTEN TOO OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I BOUGHT A COMPUTER TO GET ON LINE BECAUSE I KNEW THIS WOULD BE THE BEST TO FIND THE CD, THIS TELLS YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS ALBUM."
3,Good late seventies rock band - very difficult to find on CD,"The only album from a band that had a a one hit wonder in ""Don't Every Want to Lose Ya"". Produced by Paul Stanley (KISS ?) and engineering by Mike Stone who had incredible success with Journey in the mid-80's with this type of production. Originally on ""Infintity"" records"
5,Solar Pool Cover,"Pool cover arrived promptly and brand new. I heard that I could have gotten the same thing at a local Fleet Farm store, so I would recommend checking locally if you want to. Now I just need some hot weather in Wisconsin so we can enjoy our pool!!!"
5,3 Great Relaxing CD's - Great Price,"Being from Colorado, I may be a bit partial to the Sounds of The Rockies, but I love San Diego Beach and the Germany CD as well. They are all very relaxing. This would make a great gift for someone or to use it in your own practice. Very well done! Good price!"
5,Massage or Sleep?,"As a massage therapist, music is an intrical part of the relaxing process. These 3 cd set provides more than enough relaxation for a couple of massages. My clients even comment how relaxing the music is...when they wake up. I bought a second set just for myself to help me sleep at night."
4,Refreshing,"I'm not one of those people who requires cohesion within song selections on an album. I can't even get my head around that concept. Good songs are good songs, regardless of whether they are similar when examined from 1000ft. Chad appears to me to be an artist in the fullest sense, from his playing, lyrics, vocals, and art work. I really enjoyed this effort. I thought it was very fresh and unique; he zigged when I thought he would zag. 'Blood Machine' is eerie and creepy in the way that a very dark and someber Doors song might be. I think it is the best song on the album, and one of my favorite songs of the last several years."
5,Best of the Best. I'm buying the DVD. I may buy Several!,"I've rented and personally watched all the films on Amazon on this subject. This is the one I'm buying to have in our home. I know my husband and grown children/family/friends will watch ""Chow Down"" because it is so well made--Informative AND Entertaining! Who could not be caught up in the lives of these three excellent individuals, their health concerns, and their families? The requisite inserts of doctors' comments are appropriate, clear, insightful, and delivered with wonderful humanity. The animated segments point up statistics and clarify relationships beautifully. This is quite a film!"
4,A Very Good Book for Beginners,"I think its a really good book for beginners. I used their ideas about marketing and negotiating. It is very good and seems to be a product of experience rather than just theory. It is also simple to read. What I would want to be added to the book is that Options Investing has certain risks, for example, it seems to assume that real estate will always go up. What do you do if the real estate market crashes like the stock market. That, plus some other legal issues that are very well explained by Bill Bronchick. I saw and talked to David Finkel in Atlanta, he is really good at negotiating and amrketting. Plus, this book is available free as an E-Book, it is the best free knowledge that you will get."
5,I liked the book,"I have read many Real Estate Investment books and prefer the ones that pertain to particular ""systems"" meaning a specific approach or technique that can be actually be used to purchase and sell Real Estate. I found this book well written, insightful, experiential and to the point with case studies and examples. For the beginner or first time home buyer this book offers a well written, easy to understand introduction to the concept of the Purchase Option System. More experienced investors can pick up a nugget or two in regards to the scripts, Instant Offer System, buyer/seller qualifying and use of voice mail to screen callers."
3,A Good Basic Book,"It's a plainly written, easy to follow, basic book for a beginning investor interested in lease options. The marketing system and telephone scripts are quite helpful. A little too much ""buy our other programs"" at the end and I wish they had included sample documents but hey, for [item price] what do you want?"
4,Excellent for the purchase lease options technique,"As a beginner REI i was impressed by the detail provided on this technique. Although there are various creative ways for RE transactions, the authors focus is clearly on the lease option technique. Various real life examples give an practical touch and boost our motivating bud.I would recommend this book especially if you are a begginer. It gives a wealth of information on purchase options in clear, concise, and simple language."
4,Got my attention!,"If you are serious about checking into an investment opportunity that has some rather well designed paths, this is the book to look into. I took a Saturday afternoon to go through the book, and took notes to follow with. If you are at all skeptical about rushing into this idea, the authors put themselves up front to help you secure a better financial future and gain. Before you try any other investment tactic in real estate, check this one out first."
4,Great book for real estate newbies,"I found this book to be VERY good at explaining the basics of creative real estate investing, and following up with step-by-step lists of how to get started. This seems to be geared toward the beginner, with actual examples that bring home each point.This is a very enjoyable read...WELL DONE!"
4,Solid,"I own many books and courses on various real estate investing subjects, especially Lease Options, and found David and Peter's book to be at the higher end of the spectrum. The book is an easy read but still manages to do a good job of describing a few different ways of structuring deals.No one book or course can tell you everything about even this one area of real estate investing. But this particular book does a better job of describing Lease Options than some courses I've read that are 10 times the price!"
5,Life Changing Book,"I Never write anything about products, whether I enjoy them or not. I had to share my feelings with anyone who truley wishes to change thier lives by purchasing Real Estate with little or No money down. The book written by Peter Conti and David is THE BEST Real Estate ""How To"" book ever written. Anyone can read this book and understand just how to create mutiple streams of income with Real Estate.I have read more than 20 books on the subject of real Estate, with most all of them talking about Real Estate in general terms. Only Peter Conti and David Finkel describe step by step how to find, purchase and contoll Real Estate.I followed the books directions and now I controll 3 properties in nice area with positive cash flow ( Making Money) and I wish to publically thank Peter and David for writting this book to change me and my families life forever!!Thank you Amazon for making this book available ..."
4,Excited to take the challenge,"After reading Conti's and Hinkel's book, I have to say I was most impressed by the spirit that guides the prospective investor. Thanks to both of you for offering readers the opportunity to do this work with the intention of creating a win-win for everyone involved - seller, invester, tenant-buyer. The perspecive the authors offer allows the courageous investor to use their financial education to ""make the bleeding stop"" for sellers who need to be free from their properties, to create a better quality of life for themselves and their families, and to provide the opportunity of home ownership to those who cannot seek conventional means to do so. I for one am excited to take the challenge ..."
4,Surprisingly Refreshing,"Rickie Byars was referred to me by a friend. I had never heard of her before. I was looking for something inspirational, yet something outside of ""traditional Christian style music"" that spoke to me spiritually - ""within"". I must say, I can't stop listening to ""The Spirit Of God is Upon Me"" and ""Pour Yourself In Me"". I just wish she offered performance tracks. This sound needs to be heard!"
4,Good Place to Start for Self-Examination,"No matter how 'good' or 'spiritual' we feel, there are still negative words, actions, and thoughts that seem to come from nowhere. Andy Stanley reminds us that the Bible teaches those things come from within our hearts.By covering four main inner 'monsters' (guilt, anger, greed, and jealousy), he shows how to overcome these diseases of the heart. He particularly does a good job of showing how we all practically struggle with these four monsters, even if we wouldn't previously think so.I've found ""It Came From Within"" very helpful in teaching our teenage Bible class. Many of us adults agree that some of these difficulties very likely had their roots in our childhoods and adolescent years. When I'm blessed with children, Lord willing, I hope to be able to help them deal with keeping their hearts pure from these dangerous calamities."
5,Well worth it!,"Well written, thought provoking, and informative, this is one of the best christian non-fiction books i've ever read. It deals with four main sins of the heart: anger, guilt, greed, and jealousy. It doesn't mention pride or some of the other sins the Bible names but for the four that it does, it gives great insights to each. I found a lot of his statements eye-opening. Verses i've read and heard a thousand times were cast in a perspective i had never thought of before. Some people who've reviewed this book already didn't agree with guilt being a problem of the heart. I agree with that to an extent because feeling guilty of committing a sin makes you aware of its horrible potential if you continue in it. But, i think guilt can become a sin when you hold on to it and when it begins to hinder you from growing closer to God. In the end, this is a very short and very powerful book for anyone: from a teenager to a elderly man or woman."
5,"Guilt, Anger, greed and jealousy who doesnt struggle with them!","Andy Stanley gives great practical insights and wisdom on dealing with problems in our hearts that we all struggle with namely guilt,anger,greed and jealousy. I found this to be both an insightful and very practical book. I continue to use some of the strategies from this book in my own battles!"
3,To narrowly focused,This book should only be read by flyfishers who live in the south because it is to narrowly focused on that part of the country.Flyfishers who live farther north should buy a book with a broader scope.
3,A Good Book with quite a few irritating parts.,"Being from Texas, I can appreciate how Dixie-centric this book is, but some of the beliefs (such as Bluegill from northern states being smaller due to colder weather) are demonstratably false.Now that I have beat the book down....There is alot in here that is useful. His pointers on fishing are very good, and how he lays out strategy on each type of water would be useful to any angler . I also think he did a good job with the what he believes should be in a Bream man's tackle box.I would recommend this book to anyone, as its short commings are not too offensive and the meat of the information is very good.The biggest flaw inhibiting the enjoyment of the reading is that, like the majority of fly fishing literature, the author foists upon himself the mantle of Norman Maclean."
4,Excellent,Book provides good reference for what was occuring in the church at the period listed. recommend for those interested in history of the church
5,...and terrific introduction,"white nights, notes from the underground, the meek one, and dream of a ridiculous man - four parts that could make a book of study on shame. the introduction is the reason to get this edition - it's truly excellent, by Deborah Martinsen, researcher of shame and narrative at Columbia Uni, NY. Her other studies here, also excellent for overly passionate readers of D.:[..]a shame it's not being reprinted. pun intended."
4,under the ground,is where this book needs to be. just kidding. get past the first stream of consciousness part and theres a real story here. this book is mainly philosophy so go into it with that idea
3,Embryo - 'Steig Aus' (Repertoire) 3 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1973, looks to be Embryo's fourth actual album. Tough to describe by some, but a few might tag it as 'space fusion'. Track listing is: ""Radio Marrakesch / Orient Express"" (9:50), ""Dreaming Girls"" (10:30) and ""Call: Call, Part 1 /Organ Walk"" (17:21). You probably need to be in that 'certain' frame of mind to properly enjoy this reissue CD + do keep in mind that 'Steig Aus' is definitely an acquired taste. No doubt about it, Embryo was ahead of it's time. Might appeal to fans of Roman Bunka, Eiliff and possibly Toad."
5,My favorite gardening book,"This is easily my favorite gardening book. Already it is dog-eared and well-worn. A lovely combination of useful information, beautiful photos, and very good writing. The author tells you what she has learned over 30 years of gardening in the hot and humid southeast and does so in a way that is a pleasure to read. I highly recommend it."
2,SUPREME'S HITS (IMPORT),"WELL AT LEAST THEY DID GET THE LYRIC'S RIGHT, BUT THEY DON'T COME CLOSE TO THE REAL THING!!"
3,Not impressed with this purchase,"When looking for a nice laptop this seemed to have everything I needed: great screen resolution, fast processor, huge hard drive, alot of RAM, CDR/DVD combo, wireless and relatively light and cheap and it looks pretty nice to boot.All that is great but...this thing has crashed constantly!Device Driver errors with the graphics card especially. My hard drive appears corrupt as well(Im constantly getting errors when i run chkdsk), and my dvd/cdrom is acting flaky, it picks up the disc about 70% of the time(i have to keep reinserting the disc and yes i tried many discs and cleaning the unit). I bought this unit only 2 months ago! I highly recommend installing VIA's 4 in 1 update, helped with the graphics issue somewhat, but over all the system is not stable. Dell and Sony laptops i have owned may have not given me everythiing i needed, but they were solid."
3,"Almost good, but not quite","I wanted to love this CD because Majik has traditionally given the compilations he's been on some of their best tracks (particularly the otherwise uneven ""MetalHeadz II"" comp). This disc, while fine for a running party mix, isn't the thought-through smashing of ideas and tones that I hear in his own work. It's got some decent tracks on it (most notably #2, #3 and #9), but overall the disc seems a bit wanting. It's noisy, but where's the soul? Where's the mix in tone and speed? It's unrelentlessly thick on power, but thin on individuality. Would have liked a better mix of stuff that didn't seem to pull from the same soundscape pool."
2,good songs do not a CD make,"j majik puts out awesome tracks. no one disputes this. as for this CD though, the set he chose is not that great. individually the songs are good, i have a lot of them on vinyl myself. but there isnt a nice ""flow"" to the set that is easily apparent on sage's or dieselboy's CDs. one major ditinguishing factors that sets the pros apart from the amateurs is their ability to build sets, in addition to tight mixing. undoubtedly j majik can build a great set, but i dont think this CD is one of them. id recommend buying something else."
4,"Great, just really great speakers","These speakers are really great, they are better than the Creative Labs Inspire 6600 6.1 Computer Speakers because the satelite speakers acually have magnets in them, 2 parallel magnets, that produce sounds that are perfect for any gamer or music freak. The sub-woofer blows you out of your seat, it's great, and you can easily adjust the bass right on the volume control instead of reaching down behind the sub-woofer itself and turning a knob, which is great. The volume control icon also controls the fader (adjusting how much the rear speakers give sound). If your computer doesn't have a sound card, BUT, DOES have a virtual sound capability, you don't really need a sound card, but i RECOMEND YOU GET ONE! Get a sound blaster audigy 2, it's perfect, even though it says 6.1, doesn't mean it can't be for a 5.1 system like this one. GREAT SPEAKERS EVERYONE! I'M OUT!"
5,sweeet,"These speakers are amazing for games like counter-strike and other fps. The sound on music is clear and nice. I currently only have the volume 1/4 of the way up because these can get incredibly loud. The subwoofer is very nice for its size. The controls are easy to use, but do require some precision to use.An excellent price for the product"
3,Monsoon has gone downhill.,"I must admit that the first time I heard Monsoon speakers in the computer store I knew that was the brand that I would have to have. After I purchased my speakers (after looking for a long time) I have to admit that I was disappointed in the quality. It seems that Monsoon has gone out of business or at least not made themselves available very eaisly for purchase. I noticed that some of my wires had been ""taped"" with electrical tape and I was suppose to have a new purchase! Being the type of shopper that hates to return anything (a merchants dream) I kept the sound system. The quality is not near anything that I was expecting for the price paid, around $225. If I had to do it all over again I would not purchase anything from Monsoon. Which is said because I think they could have been a good product if they would have kept up-to-date with quality and new tech."
5,this product rocks,any product from monsoon rules. i mean if 2 speakers rule imigine what 6 speakers would do.
2,Comfy,These shoes were comfortable and roomy (I got a size 6 but it was probably more like a 6.5). The strap broke after I wore it for 6 months....usually I wear my shoes for a few years before they wear out so this was pretty unusual.
5,highest quality and best design,"Does not seem like melting butter needs a special pan, but this pan is just perfect. The consticted top contains the splatters from the butter (or oil) full of chopped garlic, and the anodized aluminum cools quickly off the burner. The handle is heavy and the pot a little tippy, but no complaint because that weight is all metal quality. And when you need to make a little oatmeal in the morning......this is the pot."
1,Awful,This is the worst movie ever! Maybe $100.00 was spent on production and outfits were definitely bought at Holloween USA
4,A must for Shaun Cassidy fans!,"If you've seen the 70's series, you know that they all look pretty cheesy in the light of a 90's day. But if you love cheese, and you love Shaun Cassidy, this one is a must-have, because it's one of the handful of episodes in which Shaun sings! This one features ""Da Doo Ron Ron"", ""That's Rock and Roll"", as well as chunks of ""Holiday"" and ""Wanna Be With You"". I take off one star just because of the over-all cheese factor. Otherwise, it's a keeper!"
4,Lentek Rechargeable Bug Vacuum,"Received very promptly. I am very happy with this purchase, although there isnot enough suction power when using the Capture Tip. Works fine without it."
1,A piece of junk,"This was a total waste of money. I probably will send it back wrapped in newspaper and absorb the cost of this junk, as a lesson learned. Did not pick up bugs or zap them Was totally useless. Should be ashamed to sell this crap. I will not recommend this product to anyone...... We got taken!!!!!!!!! There should not even be one star on this review"
1,No Customer Support,"This item has a 1 year warrenty. It is now just a little over 1 year and the battery will not accept a charge .I have contacted Koolatron who is the distributor for this product and was informed that they can not help me . After searching every available battery outlet in search of a battery and I find no battery available . So , I advise you to pass on this item since you can not obtain a replacement battery . In addition , their customer service is non existent . So , I will trash this garbage and guarantee that I will never purchase any items from Lentek again and will spread the word to everyone that will listen .Lentek BV01 Rechargeable Cordless Handheld Bug Vacuum"
4,"Good not Great, but I may still buy a second one","My house, like many others in my area, has been inundated with stink bugs. We got this product for Christmas, and were very excited to use it.To start off, I agree with most other reviewers, the suction power stinks. Most of the time, we take off the top part, and just suck up with the hose. It kills the bugs SOMETIMES. The first one or two...and you really can't have any more than 4 or 5 in the vacuum at a time (All it does is suck the bugs into the hose then ""zaps"" them). That being said, it is a VERY useful tool for CATCHING the stink bugs so I can dump them in the toilet and flush them. Works much better than the old tissues I was using before. It's useful in a way, and I may actually buy one for the upstairs."
1,It only sucks metaphorically,"I so wanted this to work!!! but the design is poor, and the motor is too weak. the Muzzle is s straight tube, to the handle of the unit, where an electric grid is apparently supposed to warm the bugs. there is to catch bag,or other way to divert the bugs, so they all sit on the grid until they cover it enough to block the air flow. The motor cannot pick up anything larger than a ladybug, and then only when there is nothing already in the tube. This was the first time I've returned anything to Amazon in almost 10 years of ordering. Stay away from this vacuum."
4,Works like a charm.,"I have used this vacuum from the moment I took it out of the box. It is very powerful and light weight. This vacuum does just what it says it would do, vacuums and zaps bugs. I should have bought it years ago!"
4,"Lentek Bug Vacuum--effective and fun, too!","I purchased this product as a Xmas gift for my husband in 2007. He has gleefully utilized this product since. Although it lacks power in the suction department, it more than makes up for that with the electrocution panel that can be turned on when vacuuming live bugs. It is well worth having if only for the sheer entertainment value."
1,Piece of Junk,"What a waste of money. Utter failure (wouldn't suck up the bugs, didn't kill them on the ""grid""). Threw it in the trash. Don't waste your money. Use a shoe. That's what we're back to doing. Would give is zero stars if that were an option."
2,Does not have enough suction power,"Very anemic. Does not have much suction power even when fully charged. Battery depletes pretty quickly also. We are very disappointed with this product, and do not recommend it."
1,rg,"This product does not pickup the Stinkbugs, even after charging for several days it does not have the suction enough to pick up the bug.Its a waste of money."
3,It does the job,"I bought this to reach and kill all the stink bugs invading the deck side of my house. They crawl into every crack and crevice, especially door frames to hide for the winter. Every time I open a door they are there and end up in the house. The suction is ok. With the cup on the end I could not suck them up. I took the cup off the and now it works much better. I wish the battery lasted longer. It stays on the charger unless I'm using it, but starts running low by evening. Given, sucking up 100 or more bugs a day begs for a heavy duty version. It doesn't prevent the stink, at least it's not splatted on the walls. I'm overall satisfied, it does do what I bought if for."
5,#1 SPIDER HATER!,"I really like this bug vacuum--especially for spiders. I keep one upstairs because my biggest fear is getting a spider in my bed!!! I'm getting another for downstairs because this morning, there was a spider in my kitchen and I had to run up the stairs to get my bug vacuum. When I came back down, I couldn't find the spider--at first. But when I did, I zapped him good! They give me the chills.I recommend this item to anyone who has this phobia. Susan R"
1,Poorly designed and does not work. Stay away,"I bought this to replace our Insectaside vacuum, which died after 4 years of loyal service. Big mistake: this Lentek bug vacuum simply does not work! It does not have enough suction to get the bugs off the carpet. A waste of $40. Stay away."
2,Not for stink bugs!,"Here in the northeast we are inundated with stink bugs - you know, those beetle like bugs that look like they are armored? The vacuum works fine for wasps, bees, flies - basically lighter bugs. But it just isn't strong enough for the average stink bug. They just don't go willingly to their death ... Wish this product had a little more umph!"
3,Bug Vacuum,The bug vacuum works but does not have enough suction and the flap that is supposed to close after the vacuum is shut off to keep the bugs in doesn't close completely.
1,Does not work!,"I have a phobia of spiders, and when I was with a friend who was also afraid of spiders, I decided to try out this product. She watched as the spider kept running on the floor, and I kept trying to suck it up with the bug vacuum. Finally, I squished it with the device, and sucked it up. Thinking that it was dead, four hours later, I went to take the product apart to return it, and there was the spider, alive and well If you have a phobia of spiders, this is NOT the product for you. It's useless."
4,Bug Vac,"This is a very handy item, especially if you get those large black water bugs finding their way into your home. You can be a fair distance away from those critters, and still 'get' them.Very handy if you REALLY don't like bugs..."
2,Not Worth it at all,This vacuum is not worth buying. It has very little sucking power and the battery doesn't last long at all. I've tried little moths and it wouldn't suck them in so imagine trying larger bugs.
4,"Is designed for smaller lightweight bugs- mosquitoes, gnats","This is a well made product, but the suction is not enough to pull in a larger bug that is firmly gripping a surface. It will definitely grab your mosquitoes and gnats and flies, but larger spiders and beetles it struggles with.The whole device is larger than it looks in the is picture. It's a little clunky. But all in all, it's got a kind of high tech overkill appeal :)"
1,HORRIBLE,I have a serious bug phobia. I got this bug vac hoping to be able to deal with bugs by myself and to not need to call someone else to kill a bug in my house. It did not even pick up the tiniest stink bug or spider. Don't get this product. You'll seriously regret it.
2,Not powerful enough,"I was really looking forward to getting this, because I absolutely hate flies and spiders. I was very disappointed. The suction is so weak that the fly has to half dead before it sits still enough to get sucked in. You have to be right on top of it, otherwise it just flies away. You can forget about being able to suck them in mid-air. It also doesn't zap them as well as it should. Several times I could see one flying around inside the tube. Way too expensive and a total waste of money."
1,Bring back bug vacuums with cartridges!,"I bought on of these because I could not find replacement cartridges anywhere for the type of bug vacuum that trapped insects in a sticky cartridge that could be replaced. That bug vacuum is powerful and it took many bugs to fill up the cartridge. This unit, on the other hand, has a weak vacuum. It will suck up flies, and it initially would electrocute them, but the electrocution function stopped working the second day I used it. And the design of the electrocution grid is poor. Flies (dead or stunned) would get trapped under a part of the grid and be difficult to remove. I returning this product and can't recommend it. Bring back the replacement cartridges for the other bug vacuum!"
2,Not bad - when worked,Was able to use it twice before the little electric grid that's supposed to kill the bug stopped functioning.
1,SHOULD BE ZERO STARS !!!!! A PIECE OF JUNK !!!!,"I BOUGHT TWO, ALMOST NO VACCUM, REPEAT; ALMOST NO VACCUM. MY WALLET WAS VACCUMED FOR THE MONEY I SPENT FOR THIS JUNK. WM."
3,Only works with small spiders,I recently purchased this product with the hopes of not having to go near spiders at all. I found that it did work nicely on the itsy bitsy spiders. It would suction to the wall and get them cleaned up nicely. The problem is this vacuum does not work with large spiders -- the ones you really don't want to be near! It will suck them in -- struggling -- and then they end up sitting at the very bottom of the vacuum. I tried to let it run for a few minutes to really kill it but it still remained down there. This happened on two occasions. I'm a little disappointed.
5,Saved Our Marriage!,"No longer do I have to hear the shattering shrieks of my wife when she sees a little spider! Now she just walks over to the bug dust buster and sucks them up.Has a flap at the tip of the arm to make it difficult for a bug to escape once the bug is sucked in. At the base of the arm is a zapper that electrocutes the bug. Once effectively zapped, the arm is removable so you can tap the base on the garbage can to get the bug out.Not good for big or heavy bugs, but for the ""normal"" household bugs as seen in the northeast suburbs, this works great. Little tricky to maneuver the cup at the tip to trap as they're being sucked up, but you get the hang of it.Nice conversation piece too."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this to suck up stink bugs....absolutely doesn't have enough power to do this. Barely works for anything else either....ended up buying the portable dyson....now that vacuum sucks.
1,Not happy with this bug zapper,"I was very disappointed with this. The charge didn't last long. The suction generally worked, but the bugs often didn't die. The trap door also didn't stay closed. If you want a device that works 75% of the time, I recommend this."
1,It Sucks .... But ....Not Enough,"It does not have enough suction power to pick up a roach from the floor.I was looking for some thing like this ,and I found at the Amazon . I order it, after reading the reviews I decide to return it but was too late I cannot cancel my order So ,, I decide to give a try , may be it works for me , after receiving,as the manual says charge it for 24 hours before use ,I charged it for that time , after 24 hours I try to turn this on it did not come on(may be I did not place it properly on the charger),then i give another 24 hours ,this time it came on but does not have enough power to suck a roach,this was a bad idea to buy this , one thing "" I did try"" but did not work ,I don't want to give any star but I guess I have to ,I am giving it one star ,in my opinion it does not deserve even one star"
1,Don't waste your money,"I got this because a friend recommended it. I am returning it, because it is a waste of money and totally ineffective. The ""vacuum"" is practically useless; it didn't vacuum in the bugs unless it was held in place for an extended period of time, and even then I had to practically scoop the bugs into the vacuum tube to get them. It also didn't kill the bugs. Everything that eventually got sucked in was still alive and kicking when I went to empty it. What's worse, is that it only seemed to have the energy to vacuum one bug before it had to be recharged. What a huge disappointment. It does not even rate one star, but I think that is the lowest score I can give it.This is the only item I've ever had to return to Amazon."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought the Lentek Cordless Bug Vacuum for spiders and the dreaded ""stink bugs""...it did not have enough suction to pick up the stink bugs, and only worked on spiders if the top suction cup was perfectly flat to a surface. It the bug is in a corner or on trimwork, etc. it does not work! Don't waste your money!!"
5,Bug Vacuum,Now that spring is here the bugs are starting to make their way into my house. This product is great for bugs flying high in places I can not reach.
3,Bug Vacuum problem,"This product works great, but one big problem is you cannot replace the batteries, so when they go out (eventually) you have to throw the entire device away.............that sucks."
1,"Novelty Item,","This item is strictly a novelty. It can hardly do the job. after the first season the battery died,and of course the warranty with it and of course Lentek had no solution. After 1 year, in the garbage."
1,Please don't buy this,"I wouldn't even suck up a stink bug, I couldn't believe that I wasted money on this. I DID read the other negative reviews and bought it anyway. Please don't buy this one!"
2,Useless,"I searched for some time for a bug vac and found this one. After reading all of the positive reviews on this item, I decided to purchase it.It was pretty much useless. Practically no suction. I wanted to use it to pick up dead lady bugs during the annual winter infestation we get here in NC. It was marginal at BEST and I'm talking about picking up dead bugs. It was totally useless for sucking up live ones.Just not enough suction to be usefull unless you want to suck up dust bunnies."
1,Waste of money,This product does not suck! But that's not a good thing. Even when right up almost on top of small moths there was not enough power to pull them into this devise.
2,It works I guess....,"Like most folks have said, its just OK for small to medium bugs but you can forget larger spiders and flies. I think that they just get irritated that you are trying to suck them up! There is not a lot of suction and it is a very large device to have sitting around your house. In the charger it's almost 2' tall which makes finding a place to keep it a challenge."
4,Problem solver!,IF YOU ARE SQUEEMISH WHEN IT COMES TO CREEPY CRAWLERS LIKE I AM TRUST ME THIS IS A MOST HAVE IT SUCKS THOSE SUCKERS RIGHT UP THEN IT ZAPPS THEM AND YOU WONT SEE IT UNTIL YOU TOSS IT OUT.I GAVE IT 4 STARS B/C IT DOESNT WORK GOOD FOR MY FLY PROBLEMS I THOUGHT IT COULD SUCK THEM FROM THE AIR BUT I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL IT LANDS BUT THEY SO DARN FAST ITS HARD TO GET THEM. BUT IT WORKS FOR THE CREEPY CRAWLERS FOR SURE!
4,Lentek Koolatron BV01G Bug Vacuum Pest Control with Recharger,"Works as advertised. Not as strong as a plug in vacuum but does the job of capturing and killing ""stinkbugs"" that are now in our area. (Result of climate warming trend??) Added benefit - reduces emergency calls from spouse to save her from...."
4,bug vacuum,"product works very well. I can deal with spiders without climbing on a chair. could be easier to clean, but all in all it is a very handy device."
1,Piece of Garbage,"This product never worked and I don't mean it didn't suction well. The vacuum never even turned on. My husband threw away the box and my receipt so I'm stuck with this. Well, rather the trash can is stuck with this."
2,A Good Idea but a little weak,This was basically a good idea but the suction is very weak and so this unit isn't very effective.
1,DONT BOTHER cuz its a waste of postage!!!!,I bought this to suck up spiders on my sliding glass doors but it was not even powerful enough to grab the small ones. The bottom line is that you pay shipping to get it and they charge you for the shipping to get it back to them.
1,Are you kiddin me?,"My wife is phobic about bugs. I thought this was the perfect gift. There are not alot of bugs around in the winter, but fortunately a spider showed up for his demise. I anxiously went for the ""bug vaccum"". I positioned it perfectly above the spider, I think it was comotose, because it did not move. I held the cover over the spider but the suction was too weak to actually suck it up the tube. I had to take off the cup and directly put the hose over the spider. Finally, the spider was sucked up the tube. Sorry, don't buy if you are a bug hunter.....Waste of $50.00"
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I have a lot of low-voltage lights on our house. Many colors and different wattages, which I dearly love. Unfortunately, the spiders also love to build webs on the siding because flying insects are attracted to the lights. One night I used my Panasonic vacuum (which I love) and got over 30! The motor chews them up and spits the pieces into the disposable bag--I've never had one survive! Nice jolly subject, right? Often, I have to hold the vacuum in one hand (20 lbs.) while using the hose with attachment in the other. This gives me over 3 ft. of reach and the suction is so great that the insect is ""gone"" within 1"" of the brush. OK, the Lentek is rechargeable, doesn't have a power cord and is lite (albeit unwieldly). After charging for a day the unit would pick up a 1/8"" spider but nothing larger. After a minute of operation the suction is down by about half and you won't get anything then. Yes, I'm back to the Panasonic and the Lentek?---the ""round file""!!"
1,Nearly Useless,"This product just doesn't work... It will suck a bug in, maybe, but it doesn't kill anything- and after a couple of minutes it won't have the power to suck any more bugs in. At best you can use it to go after the occasional fly or moth that's just out of hands reach, but don't expect you're going to do anything else with this."
1,Does not work,This product has very little suction and will not grab the bugs. I do not recommend this product. I could not even get it to grab a dead bug.
2,It's not that great.,"Delivery time was fine. That's where the good stuff ends.It doesn't hold a charge for long... mine is good for 60 secs tops. Suction isn't very strong... sometimes you have to coax the critter into the tube. The ""zapper"" doesn't always kill... sometimes it only stuns- so be sure to empty it outside.Would I recommend it? No... get a fly-swatter and a roll of papertowels."
2,Spiders are laughing!,"I bought this product for my daughter who is terrified of spiders. Now that she lives away from home she needed something to kill any spiders or bugs in her house.She was very excited to receive this product especially since she would not have to actually try to smash the spiders - they would just be sucked up and fried on the wire mesh!The first spider she tried it on - did not get sucked up as advertised and ""crawled away laughing at her"" - she then had to leave her house until someone could come in and smash it for her. So much for being fearless and independent..."
1,it stinks,"item does not do what it is intended for, and does not kill the bugs, bugs can crawl back out of the flap."
3,Disappointing lack of power,"We bought this vacuum to handle the invasion of stinkbugs that occur in fall and spring - the warmer winter weather put the vacuum to the test. It functions perfectly well, but the suction is inadequate to grab the persistent bugs off ceilings, walls, etc. Also, the cap at the end does nothing to assist - unless the bug is caught low on a wall. All in all, a bit of a disappointment."
4,Bug Sucker,"Had one of these for several years until it would no longer hold a charge. Decided to get another one because they really work for removing insects without having to deal with squashing them. If you want to get rid of bugs, this is the ticket. One thing though, the mechanism for electrocuting them doesn't really work very well. So after catching them, you just have to make sure to dump it outside."
1,Horrible Product. Returned it immediately.,"The title says it all. It doesn't work. Well, technically it DOES work, but only if you catch a bug by hand and then drop it into the tube to be fried by the little wires. A worthless product."
1,Not good for stink bugs!,The vacunm is not strong enough. The battery life is to short. Needs to have a longer reach. Hope they make a better model.
1,No guts,"This was bought to replace a Lentek BV01 from several years ago. This one unfortunately did not have near the suction power of the old one. The weight on the newer one was significantly less than the old one and therefore I suspect the motor was downsized. A shame, 'cuz the old one really worked well for flies and spiders. Returned to Amazon."
1,this never even worked,dont waste money. I got this as a funny gift for a friend who is terrified of spiders and other bugs. Apparently it can't handle ANYTHING.
3,bug vacuum review by rob,"THE VACUUM BUG KILLER WORKS GOOD WITH ONE FLAW FOR ME,THE CURVED BOTTOM PLASTIC UNEVEN FLAP,SOME MODIFICATION MAY BE NEEDED FOR A DISABLED PERSON TO PRESS DOWN MORE FLAT,OTHERWISE,IT WORKS,BUT MAY TAKE LONGER FOR THEM."
1,"what he said - gentle breeze, ridiculously horrible product","This product is ridiculous. It CANNOT suck up a spider or any other insect that can climb a wall or hang from a ceiling.As someone else said, the vacuum is super weak, gentle breeze at best. I don't write reviews ever. This is my first one, but I have to warn others. Do not buy this product.I get the feeling someone who feels sorry for insects designed it, to get back at those of us that want to kill them or remove them from our homes. Well you did it. Got my blood pressure up over the sorry fact that I wasted money on this product, and so here's your review."
1,Never worked,"I bought this product and tried to use it but it was not charged. Usually products carry some amount of charge right out of the box but I figured it may have lost this charge prior to my purchasing it. I put the product in its charger stand and plugged it in. The light came on on the charger base. I didn't think about it again until I needed the bug vacuum a couple months later. I went to use it and it didn't turn on. The light continues to be green on the base charger. Unfortunately, I was out too far out from the original purchase to be allowed to return it so I lost all my money on this one. I would recommend not buying this product. It never worked!"
3,Kills bugs dead,"I first saw this item in the ""sky mall"" catalog on a plane. My husband doesn't do well with bugs in the house, and I thought he'd like to see it. He decided immediately that he wanted one. It works reasonably well, but I don't think it has quite the suction power he hoped for."
1,Not worth it,This doesn't even pick up dead flies! Lot of money for something that doesn't work at all.
1,Piece of junk,"This is a piece of junk. It loses power very quickly and does not have any sucking power. Instead of wasting $40 on this, put it towards the Cost of a Dyson handheld. You won't be sorry!"
2,Not very useful,"This bug catcher is not very useful. It has very little suction, so many bugs don't get sucked into the tube. Also, the ones that do get sucked into the tube are then sucked against an electrical grid and shocked, which results in the device blowing out air that smells like burned bugs. A small portable vacuum cleaner is more effective and pleasant."
2,WARNING - Cans buckling!,"I purchased and received a case of these 6 oz items mid-March-2008. I used two cans then and in reflection remember one of them spewing some paste when first pierced by the opener. Tonight I've gone to open another can and this time it really projected out the paste when pierced with the opener. So I decide to check over the others and find 4 of them really BULGING - each end pouched outwards a centimeter or so. And another 8 cans showing 1 to 3 mm bulges at each end! This case has been in an A/C-ed home in a dark closet.The case of small cans appears to come from 3 different lot numbers (OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1121, OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1122 AND OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1123) Note the 1121/1122/1123 code differs.With just my visual inspection it appears all affected cans are 1122 but I will not be eating any of the remainders. I will be contacting the manufacturer ASAP to see if there has been a recall or known problem."
1,Bulging cans here too,"I also purchased this product in March and within a couple of months 10 of the 48 cans I purchased were bulging severely (looks like they are about to burst), plus many others bulging slightly. I've contacted the manufacturer and they weren't very responsive at first, but have promised to give me a refund after I go through the hassle of peeling labels off every one of these cans and send them to them.Note: the date code on my cans is A8KX24, same as the previous reviewer with this problem."
5,Organic Tomato Paste,"I use this as a thickener when I make marinara sauce. Nothing but the best, its organic (full of nutrients). Get this product you won't be disappointed.Remember the better the ingredients, the better the sauce."
5,Great Flavor,"Because there are a couple of very low star reviews (defective cans..not the actual product), I wanted to make sure I reviewed this tomato paste and gave it a well-deserved positive review.This is a great tomato paste - very rich and tomato-ey <--that can't be a word. It's just a plus that it's organic!"
2,Inside of can contains BPA,"I have bought this product regularly for over ten years but found out today that the inner lining of the cans contains the chemical Bisphenol A (BPA). I love the product but won't be purchasing it again until the company switches to cans that don't contain BPA, as at least one other manufacturer does."
3,There are Better Choices,"Muir Glen is proof positive that organic doesn't mean better tasting. This is a relatively dark colored tomato past, much like Contadina. The taste is a bit stale. Sodium levels are high for the genre, 35 mg per 2T serving, as opposed to 20.Yes, you can work with it, but there are better choices out there."
4,Does what it is supposed to,"Not sure which chip this is. I ordered 3 Athlon 64 CPUs, 2 of which came in with smashed pins due to horribly improper packaging. The third one was packaged very professionally and securely. I used it to convert a former 32 bit socket 754 Sempron box to 64 bit Socket 754 Athlon 64 to support CentOS 6 x86_64. It does what I need, but is nowhere near as fast as my current 4 core AMD 64 chip..."
4,It processes,I bought this to upgrade an old machine from a Sempron. At the time I couldn't find 754 sockets at all. I somehow found this an snapped it up. It did add a little life to the machine but by now it's kinda slow. I put this in 3 years ago and the machine was old then and it still works great for my parents web browsing. My Dad even watches movies with XBMC and streaming videos with it.No problems for 3 years and installation went as it should. I would recommend it.
3,book review,"A book for people already familiar with photoshop, too complex for beginers, written in a dull way."
4,Great!,"Great step-by-step learning Adobe Photoshop CS2, this book is wonderful. For beginners or advanced users of Photoshop, is very good."
5,Great for easy and detailed reference of everything in Photoshop Menus/Tools,"I found this a great book to go over and learn everything on how this program works (and lots of stuff that most training books don't cover). Now true, I and others find it difficult to use as purely a training manual (I like projects to learn from) and this provides no projects. But after completing my How To Use Illustrator AND Photoshop books, I got this book to go through and have a real understanding of the menu's and for easy and quick reference if I can't figure out how to do something. So I highly recomend it for that reason alone. As for learning the programs from the ground up...depends on your learning style."
1,Could of been better,"This book contained a lot of information, but unfortunately the directions are rather shaky. The way they describe the information is correct, but telling you how to get to the steps is extremely hard to follow.The book that I found much better is:Adobe Photoshop CS2 for Photographers by Martin Evening"
4,Straightforward Photoshop,"This text provides pretty much everything that you would expect. The information was detailed, clear and understandable (to me, at least). There was nothing particularly great about the layout or graphics in the book, but it did its job."
3,Average quality writing and examples,"This is voluminous, but quantity does not make up for quality. Some chapters are sketchy, so I found much better tutorials on the net, and in other books.Shouldn't have to be this way. I'm glad I'm used to working with Photoshop, to do ok with the book.IF I was getting one or two books on Photoshop, this would not be one of them.These authors do not write clearly enough for beginners, and intermediate level PS users may be better served by buying higher ranked PS books, keyed to whether you are more into photography, or graphics."
3,watching one's wait,"Imagine yourself a leading French theorist: here is a recipe for that troublesome new 'recits'- return to an earlier work (in this case, his first, 'Death Sentence'/L'arrete de Mort')- find a germane incident within that book- rip those pages out. Now set up two charatcters in a situation that mirrors the originary fictional incident- have those two characters try to analyze the event's 'implication' from within the same setting. Digress frequently. Sound a little too Stoppardian for you? Not sure you'll find the Godot-like intertextual rib-tickles very compelling? For fiction his short-stories 'The last word', or 'The idyll' are easily a thousand nights more lucid; for heavy theory, 'The Writing of Disaster' is detonative. This work sadly's just oblivious..."
3,A delightful old chestnut,"Oh sure, I was only a year old when this movie came out on ABC but it has periodically been re-aired on A&E; every once in a blue moon. It was then that I watched it.This is one of those wonderful ghost story movies that some of us were lucky enough to grow up with as children--short on the gore but long on the suspense and a decently developed storyline.Originally, this movie was aired under the title ""When Michael Calls"" but inexplicably it has since been reissued on VHS and DVD under the title ""Shattered Silence.""The only real issue I have with this DVD reissue is the poor transfer. The colors are badly washed out and faded, there is a bit of a synchronization problem with the audio/video in a few spots and the movie in general shows its age. But, with such a low price, it is hard to quibble over the quality control.I think this would be an excellent candidate for a remake, much as ""The Fog"" recently has."
4,good retro fun,I remember seeing this as a kid. It really creeped me out. a little campy feeling to it now but still quite a gem from the decade.
5,Well worth watching...,"I saw this movie when I was in my early 20's and enjoyed it quite a bit. Good mix of supernatural, suspense and with a twist at the end."
5,Excellent CD,"i just finally recieved this cd and i just finished listening to it, this cd is full of dope beats and hot lyrics not to be outdone by some nice guest appearences. cop this ish today"
4,Classic New Age Bliss,Is it real? Is it relevant? Is it empty fluff? You tell me the value of genuine relaxed and unpretentions pleasure. This album radiates simple innocent joy. It's a heart healer. Captures the moment of the early days of this genre.
3,Where's the emblem?,"The shirt itself is pretty good quality and so is the front logo. However, the logo on the left sleeve is completely missing. At least is was on my shirt. In my opinion the picture advertising the shirt is not a true representation of the shipped product.I am disappointed the sleeve logo is missing."
2,this edited version on Amazon Instant Video,This video on Amazon Instant Video is a rip off. It's only 1/2 of the mini-series (the first part) and the second part is not offered. I love the movie in its full form but the edited version leaves you hanging. I'm really disappointed.Creature (Edited Version)
3,Where's the second half?,"The movie itself would rate 5 stars. I rate it 3 becuase the second half of the series is missing.I thoroughly enjoyed what was there, but it just stops in the middle of the action.Where's the second half?"
1,Only half the movie,"This versionCreature (Edited Version)is only the first half of the movie. If you look at the DVD it is 4 hours long, not 1.5 hours like this instant video."
3,where's the rest of it?,"It's a cheesy creature feature...I happen to enjoy that sort of thing from time to time so it's cool! The beginning is so hammy it's comical, but like I said - cheesy creature feature :-)One HUGE problem...it doesn't seem to say anywhere that this is only the first half...and I can't find the second half...something it would be useful to know before starting to watch! ""Yay we trapped it"" and ""it wasn't supposed to do that"" dramatic shocked looks all round followed by credits...wait.....what????It's not the sort of movie it would kill you to not finish but still!"
3,Creature DVD,"Based on White Shark by Peter Benchley (sort of) this movie is a throw-back to the creature feature type movies. If you like improbable ""science"" and cool looking monsters then you'll probably enjoy this, I did. Special effect are handled by Stan Winston's team."
4,"You Gotta Admit, This Is Better Than Jaws 4 The Revenge","I liked this movie because it is so entertaining and does pay off if you stick with it, it also has a good cast.Why Doesn't Universal buy this off MGM and destroy the jaws 4 The Revenge negative and call this movie Jaws 4, because this is what Jaws 4 should have been."
4,Where's the rest??,"Despite being a late 90's production it deals with subject matter that doesn't age much and is set on a remote island so you don't notice a big gap in society (great that no one has cell phones as they're usually the biggest indicator of time passing) either. Fun to watch, better than most TV now. BUT - and this is a HUGE problem - 60% of it is missing! This was a mini-series, whatever Amazon is offering here just stops about a third of the way through - so an amazing waste of your time. It appears that the entire entertainment industry is run by morons who can barely dress themselves in the morning and Amazon, Netflix et al are no exception..."
3,Unevenly funny,"I already own Weller's ""Science Made Stupid"" truly one of the great works of parody that ever was. ""The Book of Stupid Questions"" is not as consistently funny though. Some questions are hilarious, but many just make me want to scratch my head. Others may find more to laugh at, or less -- your mileage may vary.You may want to do as I have done and buy an ""acceptable"" copy from Amazon Marketplace. If you are a Weller fan you will likely want to get this book sooner or later."
5,Turn out the lights and let it electrify your mind,"This was the first jungle CD I ever bought, back in '95 -- my friend and I put it in his stereo, lay back, and tripped through the next hour, astounded that such pulsing and epic sounds were even possible. It's an intricately layered, crazily morphing, but seamless journey through all sorts of energetic and atmospheric realms. I love the way that certain songs' echoes and foreshadows recur throughout the album -- as if you're wandering through a bizarre building, hearing faint fragments from behind doors before you enter them. So much jungle is just beat-driven, with few interesting harmonies or layers, but these tracks are really rich (AND the beats are rousing)."
4,Pretty Decent Read,"Even without the author warning us that he would not be able to / and is not going to cover every important event in the World history, we are already psychologically prepared for that.The author rushes through the earlier periods, but his account of the world in the 20th century is very nicely done.I would recommend it."
3,Human Story,"This was required reading for a college level course. It should not be used as a text book. While it is easy reading and somewhat interesting, the author is rather opinionated in his recounting of human history. There is a lack of balance in supporting facts, in some places there are no supporting facts. I would not reccomend it for anyone with seeking more than entertaining reading."
1,Disappointing,"As a person interested in history, I wondered how it could be crammed into one medium sized volium. After reading about half of it, I found the answer - skip many important facts and topics, run through everything in a shallow manner and you are done.I did not learn anything new or interesting from this book, but felt frustrated and enraged at the superficial treatment history gets here. Sometimes the book sounds like a story for small children - no names, no background to explain historic developments and almost no dates. Even Gombrich's ""little history"" which was written for children is much betterThe chapter aboout the ancient history of the Jews is based mostly on the Bible, without any reference to archeological or other data. Disgraceful,pretentious inaccurate and boring."
5,a great book for teens,I have not finished reading it yet. But from what I have read I thought was really good. I would recommend this book to teens. It tells stories about teens. I have read many stories in this book and they are helpful to me! This book is very much like chicken soup. I would suggest this book to anyone that enjoys the chicken soup series.
4,A Past Unveiled,"this is a well written book that gives much of the ground work for the world in which Paks lives. Not strictly a must read, but it enhances the Paks and later books if you do."
3,elizabeth moon,Elizabeth Moon writes a very good story you can really get into. The charactors are believable and you can imagine yourself in that timeline and culture.
2,"A Very Long, but Lost Legacy","Here we have a package containing the prequels to the very well done Deed of Paksenarrion. Unfortunately, neither approach the heights of that trilogy. The first, Surrender None is slow going but is worth the effort. Barely! The second, Liar's Oath, is a book that had no reason to be written. There is very little story, a confusion of who the main point of view characters are on the authors part with none getting much on page time yet not working as an ensemble piece either. In the end very little happens, and what does happen is so buried under the mundanity of most of the work that it seems trivial.Moon is a good author. She stumbled badly here though. Unless you have the disease of being a completionist, give these a pass."
3,The story ended before it started.,"In ""Deed of Paksenarrion"" there was very little explanation of the Girdish religion, so when I discovered this book I was very excited to learn more. It was very disappointing, though. Much of the plot didn't make sense to me (why, for example, is Luap so revered if Gird never even trusted him?), and it seemed like I was always waiting for character development to end and story to start. Actually, the first part of the book detailing Gird's rise to power was fairly good. The second part was the major disappointment. I would suggest reading this book only if you are very curious about the characters, or if you can't not finish a series. Deed of Paksenarrion is a much better read."
4,Be Seduced!,"A comical and satirical tryst! Delight in Wertmuller's trademark themes of politics and sex. This film adds the differences between Northern and Southern Italy and honor to the mix. The seduction is politically oriented, as you will see with the hilariously, ubiquitous presence of the Mafia. Sicilian concepts of a man and his honor is revealed in Mimi's relationship with his wife, his mistress, his wife's lover's wife, which all somehow become convoluted with politics. Wertmuller, Giannini, and Melato have not reached their heights, but all of the elements of their later masterworks are present in this film."
4,Mimi or Not Mimi?,"After purchasing this DVD, and loving it, I still have a disturbing question: is this the same theatrical release version, which, according to Wertmuller, was criminally cut by New Line Cinema (the original distributor) by up to forty minutes? Do I have to go to Italy to find out?"
2,Disappointed,"I'm afraid I was disappointed in this book. I was looking for something with more illustrated exercises, perhaps using noodles. I think this book is a little outdated."
2,Champion for superfluous detail,"I could recommend this book to every aspiring travel writer as an example of what not to do. I was totally uninterested as to what wine the writer ate with his dinner, the quality of his seat on the airplane, or any other of the zillions of details he insisted on providing. I was interested to know his impressions of the people and cultures he found in those very interesting lands he visited. I did not find out. This book was written for readers of the Ladies Home Companion, I reckon."
3,Book cover shows up blank on carousel on Kindle Fire,"I have not read the book yet. But it already has a strike against it because the book cover shows up blank on the carousel. When I look for it under the ""books"" section, the book cover is shown. But on the carousel, I will always have to remember that the blank page stands for this book. I have restarted my kindle and the problem persists. This is annoying."
1,"Shallow, poorly explained, and a weak overview (at best!)","I thought this book was pretty poor. Surprisingly, perhaps, I agree with most of the prophetic views of the author. However, the book is at best a brief and too-shallow overview of one particular view of prophecy. The author is fairly frequently referring to other words, or ""longer discussions"" that aren't appropriate. At the same time, the author often makes statements like ""Of course."" With such a brief treatment, though, how can anything be ""of course?""I'd not recommend this, even to a prophecy neophyte, as it doesn't examine the Bible and draw conclusions, as much as it makes claims and then recites references to back up those claims. The result is a poor understanding -- even a slanted understanding -- of eschatology."
1,Wishful Thinking Modulated by Scholarship,"The author's scholarship and conservatism have always been guiding lights to those having a dispensational perspective. However even though I can't justify my comments in a few words, it seems that this book expresses a trend in wishful thinking based more on trying to extrapolate from conditions abroad in Cosmos Diabolicus rather than a strict interpretation of events per a dispensational and Biblical viewpoint."
3,Don't read the reviews for this movie,"Reading the reviews for this movie made me depressed. People, you have brains in there somewhere, just use them. The ending, while somewhat open-ended, does make sense. It just requires a tiny bit of actual thought. Like, you have to actually ask yourself, why would he say/do that? That's the point.Personally, the ending was the only part of this movie that interested me. I thought the dialogue was often trite and all of these actors could do better."
3,"Streaming ""Under Suspicion""",Streaming quality was good. Content okay for that type of film. I'm a Hackman fan but did not care for his role in this film.
5,They are very comfortable and good looking,"I am not professional swimmer but I love my new goggles, they are very comfortable, they fit perfectly to my face and the only thing is that if you swim in the evening and the light is not good, they are very dark so you wont see properly"
2,This cd is copy protected,"I won't comment on the music, but I want to warn everyone that this CD uses ""Cactus 200.0.4- 4.0 build 10b"" copy protection. I could not play this CD in my computer correctly, and I could not rip the tracks to play in my portable digital audio player. I'd return it but I don't want to bother."
3,Only 8 Remixes,"It has made a MISTAKE in the INFORMATION on a site.The ""Made Mix"" is NOT contained in THIS CD!Please buy it carefully!"
4,Another Great Hit By Iio,This was a great follow up from Iio. Song is amazing. Vocals are soothing and great to listen to. Its a great song from the clubs. Moving and chilling.
3,Very goot but.........,"Look this is a good book and I have enjoyed it but I guess it didn't show what I was looking for in the first place. Having been there before and shortly after the fall of the wall I was really looking for pictures of the area before during and after construction, so I could get some sense of where things were and where they fit in now. Maybe some arial photos of the whole area would have been great. Whilst I have some idea from the book it's all somewhat vague. Otherwise I still found it a good book. I guess I will keep looking for those photos."
2,Dissappointing book from Ms. Boursier,"The cover of the book seems to suggest a book on ""unconventional"" portrait photography; howevever, most of the examples shown inside are extremely conventional -- even mundane.Furthermore the photo techniques really don't address the concepts and advantages of shooting in black and white. Virtually all the photographs could have been equally as effective in color. Frankly many would have been BETTER in color since the portraits really don't try to evoke any mood which would be enhanced in black and white -- with the exception of the cover.This book doesn't shed any new light on portrait photography which her previous book on Group Portaits hasn't already covered.To make things worse, the black and white reproductions in the book are of poor quality. The imagaes are flat and muddy."
3,sounded better drunk,"i bought this album on a whim while i was drunk one night and at first it sounded great (at the music store while i was drunk). the next morning though, the album left me a little....dissapointed. other reviewers had compared them to oasis, radiohead, and sigur ros (huh!!!!). i could see a bit of an oasis influence though, whether that is bad or good you can decide. the tracks i did enjoy (mildly) were ARE YOU THERE? and CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF MY MIND. i'll also comment on NORTHERN LIGHTS which was a peaceful song with kind of a minimalist attitude. overall it wasn't horrible but my money would've been better spent elsewhere or at the very least another round for me and my friends."
5,"Exciting and serious music, performed with a sense of humor","After hearing a sample online, I ordered the CD, and am impressed with the artists innovative and expert style. great rythms, creative melodies. It all adds up to an exciting adventure with stirring gypsy feelings."
5,Great Reading and Fantastic Recipes,This book is a must read for anyone interested in Meatfree Diets. I have enjoyed preparing a number of the recipes in the book. I am so impressed I have come back for another volume of her work. Eating a meal from Linda McCartney is an honor. She is an inspiration.
1,worng color and broken,"I just got one of the four chair set I ordered. The description stated they had white seats... the seat is not white... it's a beige. Also, the one chair I have received, arrived broken. I have emailed the provider of the chairs and am awaiting to see what their resolution is."
2,Extended Help!,"This is a truncated help extension of what's already coming with the product, it works as a ""how to"" configure things inside IIS, poor in explaining concepts and what it means, you have to already understand the subject fully then depend on this guide as a one place how to, this is not what i was searching for."
3,Not as good.,"That book isn't as good as it 'sounds'. Basically it doesn't have anything you can't find on the internet for free ;). I'm not a quite 'fan' of Windows at all, that includes IIS, but still it's always good to have book like that one next to you just to make sure you don't forget anything. Even though i gave this book 3 stars, i still think that it is really worth reading."
1,This book is useless,This book is next to useless. I don't find it any more helpful than the on-line help provided with IIS. I can safely say that every issue I've ever had with IIS was better solved by searching on Google. Don't waste your money.
1,MORE USELESS Information,This book contains all pages from the already poor Microsoft documentaion - nothing more. You get NOTHING more. It is a big waste of money. Search the help files for identical info. As with most Microsoft help books... it doesn't help.
5,Great book on IIS,"If you admin IIS and you don't have this book, you're missing out. Stanek writes near perfect computer manuals--easy enough for beginners but with plenty of info for computer professionals. I've bought several in the ""Pocket Consultant"" series and none disappointed me.As far as the covers of the book falling off, never happened to me. The covers are extra thick and stitched. I've abused, I mean used my book for nearly 2 years. Excellent!"
4,Bad quality,"I have nothing to add to the other posts here, regarding its content. I'm just learning IIS and this is more or less my starting point -- actually the ""readers' reviews"" here att amazon.com made me start out with this one. It hasn't disapointed me so far. Stanek is a skilled writer.However, this book -- like the others in this series (I've read and used the Pocket Consultant for Windows 2000 and Windows XP too) -- has bad bindings.I'm sitting here at my lab environment, haven't worked my way through to one fourth of the book yet, but already it is falling apart on me.This is no good for a book which is advertised as a handy little pocket to use in your daily work. I hope I'm not as temporarily as this one."
2,Not enough.,"I bought this book together with the IIS 5.0 Beginner's Guide from Osborne McGraw-Hill. Since I have both, I can honestly say that I rarely pick this one up to use it. I'm one of those people that buy up all the books I can on a subject when I have a job to do. While this book is well-written, it seems to be little more than the help features built into IIS 5.0."
2,Just What I Imagined,This book seemed to validate what I had thought; language and the printed word bring us together. Just wish the author could have expressed it with less words. A little tougher read than I wanted because the examples seemed to drone on forever.
2,Incredibly Hard to Understand,"I was assigned this book for history and although I like the argument and I'm using the book in my final paper it took me reading it and my teacher explaining it for me to understand what his argument was! He has this flowery or arrogant way of writing that uses a ton of words that really aren't necessary. My teacher summarized the first half of the book on one wall white board. I really wish sparknotes or cliffnotes would come up with a guide to this book because that's what it needs. Honestly, if you have a great idea and argument why write it in a way where the masses can't understand you?"
2,Unreadable Gibberish,"Though some interesting and provocative ideas are presented shedding some light on the idea of the rise of nationalism, this was largely a poorly written book that will not add an iota of understanding to what motivates human behavior."
5,"A concise intro to ""Nationalism""","I gave Anderson's seminal work on ""nationalism"" 5-stars primarily because it is concise and understandable (even to the layman) in its explanations and definitions that Anderson sets out from the beginning.Scholars in the social sciences would be smart to consult this work anytime they explore the field of ""nationalism"" in their studies. Plus, in the last chapter, Anderson does a nice job with surveying scholarly literature on ""nationalism"" before and after ""Imagined Communities."""
5,One of the seminal works on the evolution of national consciousness,"Anderson's masterful work about the development of national consciousness should be read and treasured by anyone interested in modern politics, political theory, or societal development. Bringing together an impressive array of international and polyglot sources, it is one of the few books that gives a global account of the phenomenon of nationalism and modern nation-building while disabusing readers of most of the truisms concerning nations that people today seem to take for granted. Read it, and then pass it on to your friends and family. It's worth it."
3,"Sexy Twist on ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (B Grade)","Harlequin Blaze has a gem with Hope Tarr's first book for this line. Mandy is a cop from a big family who still lives at home with her parents. She feels she is overweight, not getting anywhere in her career and her love life is hopeless.On Christmas Eve she meets bartender Josh and the sparks between them flies. Instead of going home for him for a night of hot sex, she goes home to her bed and then finds out Josh was killed.The twist in this story is that Mandy ends back in time to Christmas Eve and changes Josh's history. Think of the movie ""It's a Wonderful Life"" but with a too good to be hero and the ultimate sex fantasy any woman would want.Mandy is a great heroine who lets her inhibitions go, along with her body image that Josh finds so sexy. He is even a fan of Marilyn Monroe's body! Why wouldn't you not love a guy like this?A nice sexy holiday story.KatiebabsThe Haunting (Harlequin Blaze)"
3,Couldn't finish it,I could not get into the book. I made it to 27% of the book and had to put it down. It is just my opinion but it did not draw me into the book. The characters did nothing for me and Annie and Jake had nothing spectacular for me to keep reading. I know others liked it and happy they did but for as for me I didn't.
5,Chasing Rainbows,"Since we have been a visitor of Cedar Key many times, it was fun being able to identify the landmarks in the story. Well written. Recommended to friends."
4,Rip-roaring good time!,"Chasing Rainbows was a lot of fun to read. Jake, the hero, was gorgeous of course, but he was also an unrepentant professional gambler which gave a whole other side to his personality. Annie (aka Outlaw Annie or Annabel Lee Foster) was a beautiful diamond in the rough...and I do mean rough! She was also brave, determined, and in her own words, had lots of pluck. The dialogue between the two of them was exceptionally well-written and the characters were three-dimensional and likable so I really cared what happened to them. The imagery was very vivid and helped keep me immersed in the story. There were a few editing mistakes (e.g. using ""sight"" instead of ""site"" three times) but they didn't interfere with the flow of the story. Overall, I really enjoyed reading Chasing Rainbows and I would gladly recommend it to others."
3,Chasing Rainbows,"Didn't know it was a western until after I bought it. Need to pay more attention, but regardless a good, well written story."
3,good read,"The novel offers a good, enjoyable read, although, in my opinion, it lacks a bit more of action. It goes on too flatly despite the development, nicely described, of the relationship within Jake and Annie. Also in this case, as in the other book I read from this author, I liked the depth she gives to her characters, which are pictured in all their shades and flaws that make them all more vivid and likely.I also liked the fact that the characters, especially Annie, were mature enough to don't hold an endless begrudge over the mistrust and misunderstanding that threaten to destroy the relationship. That was very refreshing in comparison of other novels were this expedient to vitalize the story is stretched on for ever. There's a communication's problem but both the characters are quick and smart enough to recognize it, amend and forgive in a higher perspective."
1,book,Could not get into to this book. If after a few chapter it doesn't grab my attention then I don't read it.
4,good snack,"Realy liked the taste, price and quality. Only downgrade would be that about 20% of the easy peel opening packages are not serrated and need to be cut with scissors. Only defect"
4,good tasting,I have ordered this item several times and am very pleased with it. Will order again. It is one of my favorite jack link products.
3,"Good, But Tastes Very Artificial","Having never had the X-Links before, I bought them based off some customer reviews I read here. Maybe I should have read more, but these are most comparable to a Slim Jim. While they are much better, they still fall into the same category, and I was looking for something a little more ""real"" tasting. These have a much better taste than Slim Jim does, although there is still a substantial ""artificial"" taste. Highly recommended as a Slim Jim upgrade, but don't buy these if you're looking for a more natural tasting product."
4,Great taste,These may not be the healtiest snack but I can not resist the flavor. I keep a box down in my workshop so that I have them whenever I need them.They just dont seem to go bad no matter how old they get.
2,shrunk to a 42 pack,"This 50 pack was only a 42 pack in my order. When I noticed pack was only half full upon opening, I counted and box WAS short."
3,If you like Slim Jim you won't like this,"I purchased this because I had cravings for Slim Jims and read a review claiming that these were similar to Slim Jim. Well, I just received it and after one bite I realized these were NOTHING like Slim Jim. They taste like plain old boring beef sticks with jazzier packaging. Slim Jim is an institution and this is a pizz poor imitation, if in fact that's what they were going for. These might be healthier but nothing comes close to the distinctive taste of SJ. So if you want SJ, snap in to a SJ!!!!!!!!"
4,Good snack,Very good snack sticks. It does not feel greasy like Slim Jims and is easy to chew. The size is perfect for a snack so I don't eat too many all at once. I prefer it to be a little bit spicier though but they don't come in this size and price. This is good if you have a craving for protein and should help hold off the hunger between meals.
2,Doesn't meet expectations,"Sounded like a great product - pepperoni with an extra kick of flavor. But when I first bit into it, it tasted bland and strange - I was expecting something like the Slim Jim Pepperoni sticks, which are soft and flavorful. Another thing I dislike, is that neither the box nor the product itself contains any nutrition information - you have to mail them to get the info, it says. 29 sticks to go.."
3,X Stick isn't so hot.,"This will be the shortest review I've ever written, because it's based soley personal taste when it comes to beef sticks.I didn't like the X Sticks. I wouldn't even put them in the same universe asJack Link's Beef Stick, Original, 0.92-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 72)or any of the beef sticks that Jack Links makes based on the 'Original' formula/base. I dig all of their flavored stuff, spicy stuff, etc, as long as it's based on the original beef stick variety.The X Sticks taste... like potted beef, wrapped into a beef stick? I don't know, It's odd. I'm still going to eat all 50 of them or whatever; they're not awful. Just ""okay""; and in my world of seriously loving beef jerky and beef sticks, being just ""okay"" is a crime..."
5,Better than Slim Jims,"These are not the oily salted mess that most meat sticks are. I usually buy beef jerky for that reason, but the other reviews convinced me to give these a shot. I am pleasantly surprised.The expiration date is 11 months from the time of purchase, so this seems to be fresh stock."
5,"Jack Link's X-sticks 30-pack, Bacon-Cheddar","This stuff is great for snacking, has a long shelf life, and convenient to pack for travel. The taste and texture is awesome. Buying on-line saves money and time. I keep a box in my office and another at home. It is a great way to enjoy group discussions and family time. Eric D., Wanamingo, MN"
5,Great Tasting Jack Links,My husband has tried many links is his day and these stand out. Would compare these to Fat Freddies.
5,Jack Links,"I buy these by the box for my husband as his ""stash"" snack at work...he is always happy to receive them. Thanks for making a consistenly quality product. They ship ridiculously fast and we've never had a problem with our orders."
2,A dissapointing fence,This could be a great shaper if not for it's fence. The machine is very hefty. It has great speed adjustment. I don't like the tensioning mechanism for adjusting the speed. The brake pedal broke with in a year.(That's kind of typical of all brakes though) Great big throat opening in the miiddle of the table with plenty of rings for adjustment. The fence for this thing is a joke. It ruins what could be a decent machine. The fence faces never were parallel to one another. They seemed to toe in to one another. The movement of the fences in and out was terrible as well. They seem to have a wedging effect and they attract more chips behind them than any hollow aluminum fence that I have ever seen. The only way that I would buy this machine was knowing that I had to buy a fence system from someone else.(Felder has the best fence system in the industry in my opinion.)
5,Book Review for Neil Young,I've been a long time of Neil Young fan. What is great about this book is the photos there are some very good ones. Another nice feature was the backround stuff. It would be nice to see an up to date one (2nd Edision.) I would recomend this for the die hard collector.Keep On Rockin Rick Glenn
2,Pretty Bracelet - Poor workmanship,"This is such a pretty bracelet - unfortunately, the hinges are weak and break. I have one in both the green and purple jade - happened to both of them."
4,positive,"This is a good read but I still think the part about these ships in ""the guns of august"" sets the bar extremely high."
4,"Nice, very nice","Listening a couple of minutes to a prog-rock cd in a record shop cannot yield the final verdict. But I found that liking a cd at first exposure is usually sufficient (though not necessary) for keep on liking it. I liked Sommerabend at first exposure and now even more. I also listened to Novalis' Brandung but the sparkle didn't spring. As to German prog, Sommerabend and Popol Vuh's Aguirre/In the Gardens of Pharao top the list so far. As to German Heavy metal, its Axel Rudi Pell. Check him out! I didn't know myself that Heavy metal can actually be melodic."
2,Prog by numbers,"It's worth digging a bit deeper into German prog, leave this one to the side unless you've already heard the band. There's nothing actually ""wrong"" with this release, rather, it's a tad too polite and doesn't really develop into anything memorable. The drumming is fairly sub-standard for the genre and the keyboards are very dated, even for prog fans. Recalls Pink Floyd spaciness at times, but never really finds its own voice."
3,One of the most beautiful jarket.,I really like its jacket. Beautiful and romantic. But the music isn't that great for me. I think it needs more listen but also there are so many exciting musics which I can appreciate from the 1st listen. But you better 'try it yourself'. It may sound silly but I believe the album jacket and music itself tend to go together.
3,"Ok, but over-priced and falls apart","Not terribly sturdy or engaging. It's a toy your child may build once and then forget about it. Not much you can do, other than build it, play with it for a few minutes, rebuild it when it falls apart (or just lose the peices), and then put it on a shelf."
1,Parent's Review,"This Lego product seems to be for display only. Unless you glue each piece together, we have been constantly reassembling this item everytime our kid tries to play with it. It is also top heavy making it difficult to stand by itself especially when playing. Disappointed in Lego with this one. Compared to others like Bionicle, this one is not for play."
1,save your money,"all the cds on the lable ""it's about music"" are cdr's, sounds like "" it's all about the money"" to me. so save time & money and find the ones on the bellaphon lable."
2,This was a costly mistake,"I used to listen to ""Remember the Future"" when I was 14 or 15. I bought that again recently. It is OK, but repetative (like Black Sabbath repeats every couple of measures). Anyway, I thought maybe an earlier Nektar album would be better. Wrong. This album is so repetative! It only has one tolerable song (track #4) so I gave it 2 stars."
1,WARNING CDRS,I've heard some lame excuses before but allowing CDRS into the market described as CDS is not acceptable. Clearly the reason they are not marked CDRS is that they wouldn't sell for the price of a CD if they were. Amazon these products should be listed correctly or removed.
4,Absolutely Fabulous!!!!,I have been looking for this cd for quite some time and I am glad to see it here. A beautiful woman with a beautiful voice. The way she sings a song leaves you breathless. My favorite on this cd is everything. The musicians on the album are very good as well. If you want to listen to an excellent female jazz vocalist this is the one. If you ever have the chance see her perform live you won't be disappointed.
4,Could have been more exciting,"Alexandra David-Neel was remarkable. She defied convention, traveled the world, and was the first European woman to reach Lhasa. Getting there would have been an adventure even if she was the thirtieth! She learned Tibetan, disguised her identity, traveled a wilderness, passed over a canyon thousands of feet below on a rope - amazing!Unfortunately, reading the book, it doesn't sound quite so exciting. It sounds like a greater-than-usual trip to the store. I don't know why this is. The details should be enough to carry the story, those and the quotes scattered throughout, but they're not.Still, it's an impressive tale."
3,You get what you paid for,It looks like Caspian caviar and a taste a little like it. Salty and leaves blue stains in your mouth. It is good for the price but if you want real caviar I suggest to try American sturgeon or if you can afford real Caspian caviar.
3,It's ok...for the price.,"I've had much better for the same price! This caviar is average, a little too salty.But it's not bad either. 31/2 stars would be fair."
1,excellent movie but extremely poor DVD qualaity!,"Don't get me wrong. I love this movie when I saw it the first time. And I still do.However, the DVD version is extremely poor quality. The sound does not synchronize with the action (in both English and Swedish version). And the English subtitle is often too fast to see. The subtitle also fails to synchronize with the action. The sound is usually 5-10 seconds late. It is painful to watch the DVD version. It ruins the movie!"
5,Best Movie I've seen,"This is truly a bery good well acted,written,and produced film. I can't stop watching it. I'm not very fluent in Swedish,but the subtitles are great. You really get a feel for the Swedush culture. Rent or buy this movie,you wont regreat it!"
4,Soft psycho movie,A film of a boy as mother of him was passing away. I feel story's soft inclination toJulien Donkey-Boyalso Sweden's movie had originated earlier.
3,"Why, dear God, is this a ""comedy""?","While this movie has about as much business in the comedy section as Austin Powers does in romance, it is an excellent film. I only give it three stars because of the little girl's chest taping incident and the repitition of that damn ""I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts"" song. Other than that, that kid is INCREDIBLE. I find it amazing how some child actors can move you to tears with simple facial expressions while others induce you to form a deep hatred for all things 12 & under. The story is terribly depressing in that beautiful, European way that Hollywood has so much trouble grasping. I recommend seeing this movie at least once--it makes an impression."
5,ONE OF THE ALL TIME GREATS IN CINEMA,A massive world wide hit when it was first released.Simply the greatest film about childhood ever made.An absolute flawless film in every way. The final scene combined with the memorable music will stick in your mind forever. A masterpiece of film making - truly unforgetable and exceptionally moving.I have seen it numerous times over the years.One of the ten best films I have ever seen.
5,One of the great movies about children,"I absolutely agree with Mr. Frazer. I first viewed the film over 20 years ago and to my tastes, it is one of the best films about children of which I am aware. I would place it on par with ""Fanny and Alexander"" and ""Hope and Glory"" (Boorman). The film does have a mild sexual content, but we allowed our son to see it even when he was young. (In the US some might not agree with this choice.) We've watched it again and again through the years. Similar to our experience with other exceptionally fine movies (and wines), it seems to improve with age. I would recommend it without any reservations whatsoever."
1,DVD quality is worst I've seen - get the video,"One of my favorite flicks of all time (after seeing it on video), but the DVD quality couldn't be worse! Real poor, amateurish conversion. Desperately needs a redo. Give it to Criterion Collection and let them do it RIGHT!"
1,Defective item,The new DVD would not play. Struggling with exchange process. Not completed yet. Extra $$ into this. Hoping for a happy outcome
1,Dangerous!,"Well this does not work well at all. Basically the extendable tubes that come out of the barely ""flexible"" tubing leak gas! When firing it up for the first time, I knew something didn't sound right and the flames were very weak. Out of curiousity for a leak I placed a lit burner under the grill at the place where the solid extandable tubes come out of the flexible lengths and the tubing lit up from leaking gas! Unfortnately I had thrown the packaging away and so I am sure cannot return it for a refund. So be warned! This is nasty made in china rubbish! Don't go near it!"
2,Third-rate at best.,The best thing about this book is the preface by Charles Rosen. The rest it hugely disappointing. It is amazing how a poet can be so non-descriptive! How can any writer has been friends with both Mozart and Casanova and yet have nothing to say about them? One gets no sense of what life was like during the end of the 18th century at all. Even Da Ponte's own thoughts and motives do not come across. All that is left are petty political games at an assortment of different opera houses. Da Ponte's story is less amusing than the description of a single flirtation in the truly interesting and picaresque memoirs of his friend Casanova.
4,Wanting Volume 3,"I bought volume 1 and 2 for my father for Christmas, secretly I knew it would be something he could also watch with my 2 year old son. Overall I have watched these with him, and he was just so happy. Everything played on tv now is just crap, serious crap. Not only is animation poor, but plot lines awful, and what they do in the shows is gross. Back to the DVD. Overall quite enjoyable, it gives a great mix of what was on tv then.I would recommend this for any good cartoon lover."
4,Great Classics,"Got this for my fiance because he loves the old classic cartoons. Some of them we don't recognize,but most of them bring back good memories of sitting and watching Saturday morning cartoons when we were kids."
3,OK,"My seven year old likes some of the episodes, especially Magilla Gorilla. He stumbled on Grape Ape recently and his love for that has transferred to Magilla Gorilla."
2,Be Sure To Test It,Content is awesome. The problem is that the disk hangs while playing it. After it locks up you have to turn the player off and then fast forward to where it was before. My problem is that I orered to many movies from Amazon. I'm trying to catch up on the ones I have yet to open. My return window expired 10 days ago.
1,Very Disappointing (Zero Stars),The notes stated that there were going to be some good cartoons here. SAVE YOUR 20 BUCKS. No Herculoids and Frankenstein Jr. and The Impossibles could not be found. Think I will have to go back to my first plan and simply wait for a studio to release these two titles separately like they did with Space Ghost and Bird Man. Please wake me when the studios release what I want and not just what they want to waste my time with.
4,Beautifull ornament,I bought this ornament for my wife. She is a big fan of New York. It looks great in the box and on the tree.
2,meh,This item is very large for an ornament. Despite that it has poor detail. It comes across as very tacky.
5,Beautiful Ornament,This is such a pretty ornament! A perfect gift to remember our trip to NYC! The details are really wonderful. It is bright and colorful! I love it!
1,Kurt Adler C4055 New York Glass Cityscape Ornament,"What a disappointment! Bought two, one for a gift, and they were trashy rubbish. Not sure which bit was glass, either - they were hard plastic or at least seemed that way. It was so poorly made I could not give the gift one without being embarrassed. Would never buy one again."
4,HE'S A COOL DOLL,WELL THE YELLOW PLASTIC SHADES AND THE OTHER ACCESORIES ARE REALLY CHEAP AND CHEESY BUT THE DOLL HIMSELF IS VERY HANDSOME AND WELL-MADE. HIS CLOTHES ARE ALSO VERY HIP. YEP HE'S A DOLL ALRIGHT!!!!! I THINK I MIGHT KISS HIM TOO!!!! 4.5 STARS.
4,Singh Kaur sings like an angel!,"You can find Singh Kaur (Lorellei)here at Amazon with her works ""Fairy Nightsong"" and 2 CDs called ""Crimson Collection"". She is also featured in ""Instruments of Peace"" by Soundings Ensemble and in a Christmas Cd called ""What Child Is This"". For more information you might contact Soundings of the Planet at http://soundings.com/_peace or 1-800-93-peace."
3,Mediocre mix cd,"There aren't many djs that has remixed a few Madonna songs that I actually like. Victor Calderone is the only dj whose remixes of Madonna's songs I actually like. I bought Victor's ""E=VC2 vol.1"" a few years ago and liked it. A couple of years later when I saw a second volume, I immediately bought it when I came across a copy in the used bins. I must say that I was not impressed by what I heard. I now know why I don't care for hard house and tribal beats, after listening to ""E=VC2, vol.2"" I just learned to have an aversion to that sort of dance music. The beats are bloody boring and repetitive. There isn't a sense of melody and no vocals. The few songs that I did like on the mix cd was the tracks by Mary Mary, Mandalay, and Madonna. Everything else made me reach for my bottle of Excedrin for the pounding headache I got out of listening to this boring and repetitive cd."
2,shoddy product quality,"I recently purchased one of the large stainless steel broiler pans from the Vermont Country Store catalog. I was happy to receive it but am concerned about one aspect of this product. Across all edges but especially in the slots in the top portion of the pan, there are extremely sharp edges. With a razor blade I'd expect this, but with a cooking pan?It is unsafe product, as delivered. I'm sure I can deburr it, and break the edges with a bit of emery cloth, but is this a reasonable expectation for a consumer product? It was not sold as a kit."
5,Perfect little broiler for one or two!,"Looks great, works wonderfully! This is the perfect size for my uses, as I usually just broil a bit of lamb or sirloin for myself. I also love the loop, which makes it easy to hang. :) Love it."
3,adequate,"Although this broiler shoud be made from a heavier gradestainless steel, it is adequate and does the job."
1,Stainless Steel toaster oven pan,I found the edges on this pan to be sharp. Also the size given on Amazon's website was deceiving since the inside measured much less than the outer edges of pan. This makes for much less cooking surface. Maybe this should have been noted on the description of pan.
2,not as expected,"it was smaller than i thought, and will not get clean in dishwasher. Its a piece of junk, not worth the money!"
3,"Small, Fits in Dishwasher, Scorches Easily hard to clean",The small size makes it convenient to use when cooking for two- and it fits in the sink for it to soak. I thought this would be as easy to clean as all our other stainless steel kitchenware. Unfortunately you have to take a scotch-brite pad or a heavy duty brush to make this thing look new. Non-stick cooking spray scorches and burns and takes awhile to clean off. In general a good product if you're looking for a small broiler plate.
5,Just what I was looking for,I really like this pan. I can do enough fries for my family of four on it or broil four steaks when we don't feel like lighting the BBQ. I was looking for a broiler pan to replace the one that comes with the oven. My husband wanted the assurance of no rusting and easy clean-up. I don't think the stainless is thin (like other reviewers had commented). This is not meant to make a turkey in... I also don't think the edges are sharp. Well worth the money.
3,Light Gauge Polished Stainless Steel,Broiler Pan cleans up very easy with over the counter stainless steel cleaners.The only product complaint: Very sharp edges
4,Excellent little product,"I really enjoy this little broiler pan. For the single person living alone it's the perfect size and it's dishwasher safe.Very nice looking, while being incredibly useful."
2,Thin and sharp,"The thickness of the stainless steel is not listed. I can see why. The broiler pan is very thin and has sharp edges that need to be softened. Should you accidentally drop a chicken I should think a major dent should ensure. The bottom pan has the same flimsily feel and it too has sharp edges as well. I was looking forward to this pan, but the feel puts me off.I'll use it until I find a better-made piece."
5,Broiler Pan Extraordinaire,"When a replacement was necessary for us to enjoy broiled steaks again, I searched for a new broiler pan equal in size and better in quality than the one in the trash. It took a few minutes online to find what I thought would meet my specifications. To say this broiler pan is good, is an understatement. It is EXCELLENT. We have used it several times since the delivery right to our door by Amazon. The food turned out perfectly and the clean-up was easier than anyone could ask. Not only that but the price was under what I thought it would be AND with Amazon's delivery program, they paid the freight. It doesn't get any better than this."
4,Better Than Expected!,"Read the reviews and did not expect much, but really needed a broiler pan to fit in our toaster oven. Every one I have purchased in the past rusted horribly in short order. This pan arrived looking and feeling better than I expected. Sure, it's a bit cheesy, but not by much at all. Cleans great in dishwasher. Should never rust! Be advised the loop on it seems useless. Who would hang the slotted top only? Whatever it's purpose is, it added enough to the width to keep the pan from fitting in our oven. It was easily removed by hand."
4,petite broiler pan,This is the perfect pan for a single person or couples. No need to drag out the large broiler pan that came with the oven. It's perfect for a couple of salmon or beef steaks. This was the best investment I could have made.
3,Not great quality,"The broiler pan that came with my toaster oven was junk, so I bought this item as a replacement.The broiler pan is marginally dishwasher safe (it's got stains on it after 3 washes.)The item is thin and feels cheep. It's better than the original, but not by much."
2,Not Quite an Homage to Christie...,"This book is not an homage to Christie the way ""A Thousand Acres"" might be seen as a work retroactively illuminating ""King Lear."" In no way does Bannister seem to encapsulate any of the features that made ""Ten Little Indians"" such an amazing work of mystery literature. Instead, she's written a rather dull and plodding mystery, one that replaces ""Whodunnit?"" with ""Who cares?""Let's face it, no one is going to be able to improve upon ""Ten Little Indians."" Even Christie's play, along with countless film versions, have changed the ending to a trite ""tie up all the loose ends"" phenomenon, where the ""good"" characters get a happy ending. The great thing about ""Ten Little Indians""--something that Bannister doesn't seem to understand--is in its resisting of the formula."
5,Lyrical. Peaceful. Warm. Graceful.,"I first heard Tom Barabas on a little known CD called ""Piano Portraits"" which has become my favorite piano instrumental CD. Finding him again on the ""Sedona"" CD's, my hopes were very high!I was not disappointed. His signature style- lyrical, delicate, sweet, and warm - is greatly evidenced in ""Journey Back to Sedona.""Tom Barabas drains the sweetness out of every note like sueezing a grape and finding pinot noir.Nuages is exquisite - lilting and sweetly soaring melody. Thisis the most Piano Portraits-like melody. Plaintive. Haunting.Journey - love the acoustic guitar work - just the right touchVisions - the piano work on this is very good, love his touchand timing.Kaleidoscope is graceful, lyrical and the B-1 organ is a funaddition to the songCircle of Friends - Warm and melodious, you can almost see thefire burning and the sun setting on the deep red mountainsof Sedona.I really like this collection. Hope it warms your heart, too."
3,"Works ok under ideal conditions, but will not last through a winter","This is truly a case of ""you get what you pay for"". This cover is fine if you don't use your grill often and if it has rounded edges. Its a good size and will fit over most grills. It has a nice soft inside and doesn't seem to damage the finish of your nicer grill.However, there are plenty of downsides. If you have sharp corners on your grill, this will rip in a few weeks. We lived in a a townhouse and had to store our grill outside for the winter. This cover did not make it through the harsh new england winter and had nearly tore in half by spring.Depending on your use, this may be adequate, but invest in something more heavy duty if you live in a harsh climate."
1,lousy gas grille cover,This has got to be the worst gas grille cover I have ever bought. The cheap plastic cover started to rip almost before I put it on the grille. After being on 1 month it is ripped so bad I need to throw away.My next move is to try and return. Stay away from this lousy product!
2,Didn't make it through the winter,Unfortunately this cover didn't make it through the winter. The wind and snow pretty much shredded it after a few months. I've gone with a bit more durable one now.
3,Really REALLY for meditation,"I bought this to play at my Herb Shop, hoping to create a serene atmosphere for my customers when they enter from a busy plaza. I have to turn it off after only 15 minutes or so, as it really is meant for meditation.It is extremely quiet, slow, Oriental music, which I've found is perfect for my clients when I'm rendering a Reiki treatment on them. Comments have been, ""...oh, I'm so relaxed, I don't want to get up..."", and ""....that music is putting me in a trance...it'w wonderful!""So, depending on what you're looking for, this will either be the BEST meditation CD you'll ever find, or it will put you in a coma.....All in all, I really do like it, but for limited intervals."
5,Perfect,"First heard this while I was getting a Reiki treatment. Now that I'm a Reiki Master, I use it when I'm treating someone who needs to unwind. Useful also for people who have trouble getting to sleep. It soothes the weary soul."
2,Better options out there,"This player has several things that annoy, the primary being that it cannot be used as a 'mass storage device'. This means you have to use either the included software, or windows media player, to transfer files. If you can get past that, it works just fine. The buttons are weird, and difficult to press, and the battery life is average. Also, if you want to move stuff from the player to your computer, it takes _ages_. The link is in some way downgraded for uploads, as near as I can work out. All that said, for less than $100 it's not the worst option - 1.5 gigs is a lot of music!"
4,Pretty cool,I bought this item and works fine except that you can only load a certain amount of songs and it freezes up. I guess that what I get for a refurbished unit. next time I am buying a new one. But over all it is a great mp3 player small and compact light weight and I love the feature that you can leave the back light on all the time.
4,Great Sound - Good Size,"I owned this player for about a month before returning it to the store and getting an iPod instead. I wasn't disappointed with the player at all - infact, it was great. I was just very annoyed with a 90-day warranty - and I had bought this product new - not refurbished or factory renewed or any crap of that sort. The headsets were Sennheiser but quite flimsy. I preferred my Sony Street Style headphones.The Rio Taxi software was good and the USB interface was snap as well. I have owned quite a few MP3 players - Archos, iRiver, Apple and Sony - I would rate the Rio higher than iPod on battery life - the sound quality was about the same but the iPod interface was much better - this is not to say the Nitrus had a bad interface - infact it was quite good.But then I had paid around $179 for the Nitrus - I thought I'd pay about $80 more and get an iPod. But for this price the Nitrus is truly worth it."
2,great in the short ter,"YEP, I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN I GOT THIS RIO. IT WORKED GREAT, LOOKED COOLER THAN AN IPOD (SUCKERS), THE ONLY THING THAT PISSED ME OFF STRAIGHT AWAY WAS THAT I COULDN'T MAKE A PLAY LIST WHEN OUT & ABOUT....HOWEVER, I GOT OVER THAT.THE REST, MY GOD. I EVEN CONVINCED MY MATE TO GET ONE. BIG MISTAKE. I FEEL ITS MY FAULT. MINE GOT FAULTY ABOUT 6 MONTHS AFTER HAVING IT, IT WOULDN'T CHARGE PROPERLY, THEN MIRACULOUSLY STARTED CHARGING AGAIN (?) ....HERS STARTED DOING THE SAME. NOW I CAN'T EVEN TRANSFER MUSIC TO IT, COMPUTERS DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEVICE AND THE DIVICE SEEMS NOT TOO BOTHERED ABOUT A COMPUTER EITHER...SO...WHO KNOWS, MAYBE ITS A COINSIDENCE,AS I SAID, ITS GOOD IN THE SHORT TERM."
1,beware,It will function for about 3 weeks after the warrenty expires and then die. Go online and read the rio users forum. If you buy this product you will regret it.
1,Be afraid... be very afraid,"Bought a remanufactured Nitrus for a bargain price, but it was no bargain. It died suddenly and for no apparent reason after seven weeks - no wonder they only give a 30 day warranty! It's a real shame since the design, sound and features are great. Yes, I read the reviews so I knew about the reliability problems, even with the new (non-refurbished) units.I figured that if I took good care of it it might last awhile. I was wrong. Caveat emptor, indeed."
4,Very good for the money,"This is my first MP3 player. I just recieved it today as a Christmas present. So far, I am satisfied with this product. HOWEVER, there are some problems. When I took it out of the package, there was a very little chip on the corner of the back. Adding to this problem, there are some scratches on this product.Other than those minor problems, I highly suggest you get the refurbished unit. 1.5 GB for this price is very good (although the actual compacity is about 1.3 GB). Uploading songs through the provided USB cord is very fast and easy(I am using Windows Media Player).Overall, this product is very good for the money. I recommend the refurbished unit."
5,History Repeats Itself,"This small book about Saint Athanasius is not a biography. So if that is what you are looking for, this is the wrong book. Though Michael Davies does briefly cover the Saints forced exiles and includes an appendix of a chronological table on the life of Athansius.The books main purpose seems to first remind us that the Church survives every crisis with the integrity of Her doctrinal teachings intact. And that the Faith is not served by covering up historical facts. The author also does a good job of showing us how Saint Athanasius found himself standing alone in the face of the Arian heresy and defending Orthodoxy. And Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre who in the Post-Vatican II era similiarly found himself defender of that same Orthodoxy. This defense of the Catholic Faith is what earned Saint Athanasius the title ""The Great"" and that of the ""Father of Orthodoxy."""
1,Save your money,"What is most striking about this book is the author's failure to enter the world of the 4th century. As he seeks to make an historical narrative of the dramatic events of Athanasius'life he comes off as a 20th century Evangelical who describes Athanasius as giving ""Bible studies"" to the saints in Rome! Bible studies? Who uses such language in the 4th century. Athanasius encouraged asceticsim in Rome, not Protestant Bible studies. The narrative doesnt compel, intrigue or flow. Insight is nonexistent and it was painful to read the life of one of the Church's greats so poorly portrayed with so little effort to engage the reader with the actual thought of Athanasius--not Roman, Protestant or Eastern Orthodox, rather a church Father of the 4th century--long before there was a divided between the 3 great faiths of Christendom."
2,Lids don't fit,"These are nice bowls if all you're looking for is a mixing bowl. They have measurements lining the inside of the bowl, a nice rubber grip on the bottom, pour spout and handle. That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Unfortunately I wouldn't trade my silicone mixing bowls for anything and was looking for a bowl with lids. The lids that come with this set don't even seem like they're made for it, they fit very loosely, actually just sitting on top. I returned them for Oggi bowls where I can marinate, refrigerate salads and store items I am preparing. They should be advertised as just mixing bowls rather than mixing bowls WITH lids."
3,WHAT HAPPENED????!!!!!,"The CD started out tight, but at the end, on of the tightest songs in the nation, got cut short!! It just faded out like It ran out of space on the Cd. OG Ron C, you wrong for that one dawg! That's the second Cd that cut off on you. Remember Devin the Dude's ""2 the xtreme""...you left out four songs from that Cd!!"
5,Two Brothers,"This is a great movie for kids and adults. It held my attention and interest all through the movie. It's a great story, and touches the heart. I recommend it for any age group. I bought one for my grandkids and they watch it over and over again."
3,NOT for young children,"This film is very intense and scary. While there are lovely moments, and the cinematography is great, it should not be labeled as a ""family"" film. The violence is way too real for young children. Just because the victims are the animals, doesn't make it less so."
5,"Painful, but ultimately heartening.","As an animal lover--especially of cats, big and small--most of this movie was extremely painful for me to watch. The movie begins with an idyllic babyhood of the two adorable tiger cubs, Kumal and Sangha, but quickly became a chronicle of their suffering and travails. First their father was killed by a big-game hunter (Guy Pearce), then Kumal was captured and sold to a cruel circus-owner, then their mother was wounded, and Sangha became the captive of a heartless governor. Stoic viewers who manage to stay with the movie, however, will be richly rewarded with an ""all's well"" ending that is amazing and extremely moving. I broke down into a blubbering mess. Director Annaud deserves bountiful plaudits for his amazing work with the tiger ""actors"" and for his impassioned but artistic statement on behalf of tigers (and all wildlife). We human beings have done so much evil to other creatures--but we can also do much good. May we become true stewards of the world."
1,CRAP CRAP CRAP,"Almost all the 1 star reviews---which are the only ones that are any fun to read---are by stupid sensitive morons who just say oh it's not for kids.But they miss the one GLARING problem...the whole ""greedy and stupid human idiots"" and the tiggers who are supposedly so much better.I don't feel sorry for anything that happens to these stupid tiggers,and I don't feel sorry for sensitive jerks who cry through the whole pile of dreck they call a ""movie"", but fail to see how utterly POLITICALLY CORRECT it is. If you all call me a speciesist,I'll take that as a compliment."
5,A Touching Tale!,"This movie is so heartwarming. The tigers are all so beautiful (and so is Guy Pearce). Have a tissue box handy though. The DVD also has great special features, not only on the making of the film but also on tigers in general. It's so refreshing to watch a film that is truly meaningful."
5,Recommend! Well Written! Beautiful Cinematography!,"I was a little apprehensive about watching a tiger cub movie (I hate crying!) I am glad I watched this one though.The tiger cubs were so cute!(they were fun to watch) It has a thought provoking message to the story, it really doesn't put the blame on any one person for the current vanishing tigers in the wild from about 100,000 to current 5,000 but shows the precarious situation that the tigers are in.You'll fall in love with these two brothers! They are beautiful!In a world where there is so much going on it is easy to forget what the animals in the wild are experiencing, this movie captures that and gives the viewer a new appreciation for these beautiful animals."
3,"Kind of a sad, heartwarming story",I'm in support of saving the tigers and this movie may have set the goal. Well done good quality good camera focus and well done. I recomend this movie to all!
1,Not a kid's movie,"My two cried almost all the way through this movie. It's starts with some cute scenes of the tigers as cubs out in the jungle. What follows is an hour of tigers being abused by humans. Even the ""happy"" ending is a bit of a let down. (Promises of a ""happy ending"" is why we didn't turn it off 1/3 of the way through. We should have turned it off or skipped to the last scene.)I suppose the point of the movie is that tigers are magnificent creatures that shouldn't be in circuses or kept as pets. Fine, I'll go along with that. But I don't need an hour and a half of depressing animal cruelty to make the point.My kids are 10 and 7 and both hated it, as did both parents."
1,Not for the sensitive...,"I took my 10 year old son to see this in the theatre. He cried just about the whole film. The ads made this seem like a comedic romp, but nothing could be further from the truth. It careens from one disaster to another. PlEASE before you buy this to show your children, check out the review at Movie Mom. It's georgeous, but very upsetting."
2,Not the cute movie I thought it was going to be,"When we saw the previews for this we were excited being avid tiger lovers.While the movie is moving, it is boring and if you're a tiger lover you're more likely to leave mad. It is the sad tale of how men are killing these beloved creatures. It is not the cute story of two tiger cubs that I thought it would be."
1,Not for everyone,"The film has some cute scenes but very difficult to watch. It was painful to watch the torture of the animals. And it is a reminder of what goes on in third world countries. Definitely not for sensitive people and is not for everyone. Although the film's message was clear, it did not have to have 90 minutes of such painful scenes ."
1,Real Snoozer,"I took my four year old son to see this while the rest of my family saw Spiderman 2. While my son enjoyed the tigers, this movie did not keep my his attention and he asked to leave early."
3,Flipper,I bought flipper because I remember watching it when I was a kid. I wanted to show it to my kids especially my 3 year old son who loves dolphins. The movie is good but might not be appropriate for younger kids. I did not remember the dolphin getting shot in the movie and my son was very upset about it. Other than a few sad scenes it is a good story and has some great dolphin scenes.
5,Excellent family viewing,This movie is beautifully done. Adults as well as children will thoroughly enjoy. I've watched it several times and will continue to do so.
1,Not a Family Film!!,Very sad movie of human cruelty and ruthlessness. Not for little ones. Really bothered my 9 year old and she insisted that we write a negative review. Keep this one for the adults.
1,CHECK YOUR REGION CODE,"I neglected to specify a region code for this DVD, and as such I recieved a copy that is not playable in Australia.My bad should have known better, but like wise Amazon should also have noted this. Lucky there are programs out there that will back up the DVD and change the region codes as it dose."
3,Nature movie-very family oriented.........................,"Writer/director Jean-Jacques Annaud lays it on a bit thick with this family-driven nature film. The title refers to a pair of Indochina tigers, Kumal and Sangha, who are separated soon after their birth and are brought up in wildly different sets of circumstances. Sangha is domesticated by the family of the local French administrator, with the only child Raoul establishing a strong bond with the beast. Meanwhile, his brother, Kumal, suffers a more traumatic upbringing, sentenced to a life of performing in a travelling circus.Though gorgeously made and featuring astounding performances from the pair of tigers, Two Brothers is a little too lightweight and dramatically underwhelming to set the pulse racing."
5,enjoy a good movie,"THIS MOVIE IS SO GOOD, I HAVE WATCHED IT SEVERAL TIMES AND PURCHASED IT TWICE. THANKS"
3,Lacking in a few areas,"Don't take me wrong, I didn't think Two Brothers was a bad movie at all, I just didn't find it as rewarding or moving as everyone else seemingly did. Now, I have really liked animal adventure movies from the past like The Bear, Benji The Hunted, or Homeward Bound. All of those were really great films. I just thought Two Brothers lacked in a few areas such as a real sense of adventure. During most of the film the tigers were held in captivity and that really slowed the pace of the film. I actually kind of thought the film started to get boring in the middle. Another thing Two Brothers lacked was a real sense of character differential between the two lions. When they are finally reunited I had a hard time remembering which lion had endured which tragedy before being reunited again. This really kept me from getting an emotional connection between the lions as real characters. So all in all, not a bad movie with a really good message, but I've seen better movies of this type."
5,What in the world is this?,"I only rated it 5 stars because I have one to sell. I bought this because it was filed under Cheb i Sabbah and he did produce this. Also includes Ornette Coleman. I'm not exactly sure who the target audience is suppose to be. I guess if you know who Ira Cohen is and like his poetry then you would probably be into this. It is mostly poetry reading with some background music. I think. To be perfectly honest I haven't listened to all of it, just the first few seconds of each song. If you buy it, buy it from me."
2,Nektar's Folly,"I know many Nektar fans who truly love this album--and I can certainly see why, as it's probably the group's most varied effort. However, such a ploy is a double-edged sword, and in this case, at least to these ears, the album's eclecticism is a primary contributor to its flatness and directionless feel. The circus concept motif is--and was back then--incredibly dated, even sophomoric. On the other hand, the playing is quite good and the arrangements (especially on ""Nelly the Elephant"") are well-orchestrated. But apart from a few quitessential tracks (the aforemetioned ""Nelly"" as well as the scorching ""Astral Man"" and Fidgety Queen"")the concept overshadows the musical execution pretty drastically in this case. A Tab in the Ocean, Remember the Future and Recycled are the three Nektar albums you really want to hear."
3,Academic book; I prefer more photos,"This book is nice because I love the Mayan city of Yaxchilan, and it is really difficult to visit. The book is more for academic/college than general reading. I would have preferred that the book include more photos."
3,Concerts then and now,"Live: Boston Music Hall 12/5/72I remember this show, but I must have been pretty stoned. The promise in the song titles only yields rough, atonal tunes, proving once again that you had to be there, and you can't go back."
2,Disappointing,"Before you buy this you should realize what your getting for your [money]. Five songs, most of which aren't very good, and one of which (Santa's Beard) you almost certainly already own. All this amounts to just over 10 minutes of music. I'm as much of a TMBG fan as the next guy, but this simply isn't worth more than a buck or two."
2,Frankly a little disappointing,"It's one thing for a CD like this to be short--obviously one look at the tracklist and you know that you're buying a special edition CD that won't have a full-length album on it. But the fact is, the quality of these tracks is just not up to the TMBG standard, which makes it an even harder pill to swallow that many of their great holiday songs don't make the disc."
3,"Five Good Songs To Get You Into The Christmas Spirit, but...","I think that this is a really good album, but isn't the price a little bit high? I mean five songs, it's not that much and it's being sold for almost ten dollars. They should at least half the price. But it's got five songs on which aren't unbelievably great, but a good listen to at Christmas time. I wouldn't reccomend this because it just isn't worth the money."
4,overpriced!,"all of the songs on this single are wonderful - i truly think it's a great holiday collection, and an important thing for any true they might be giants fan to have. however, ten dollars is quite a bit for five songs. also, i already had all of these songs before getting the cd. i do realise that this probably isn't the case for the average tmbg listener, so i'd say get it, if only for the cute sticker and fun liner notes/drawings, but the songs do truly rock."
4,The best little Christmas EP you ever did see!,"This EP came as part of a bundle off TMBG's official site, so I can't complain about its price. Anyway, I'm a fairly new fan of TMBG, having just recently made my first purchase: ""Dial-A-Song: 20 Years of They Might Be Giants"". The ""Holidayland EP"" is not bad. I like all the tracks on it, my favorite being ""Careless Santa"", an unbelievably weird tale about (I'm assuming this) a guy hiring Santa to help him rob a bank. It's also got ""Feast of Lights"", the second song I've ever heard about Hanukah (the first being Adam Sandler's song, of course). I also enjoyed their covers of ""Santa Claus"" by the Sonics and ""O Tannenbaum"" in its original German."
4,Relaxing fun!,"When I was in college, a friend of mine owned a kalimba and allowed me to borrow it for a few days. I found that picking out tunes on it was fun and relaxing, and that I enjoyed the sound. When I saw this item on line, I decided to see if that would still be true. It is! The instrument was delivered promptly, and was well packaged. It is sturdy, and the wood grain is pleasing to the eye. The only reason I didn't give this five stars was that it was shipped badly out of tune, but that was corrected after a brief search on the Internet. It sounds wonderful now! Another thing to watch for is that tiny amounts of the chrome plating on the keys might flake off a bit at first, so you might want to give them a good wiping down to avoid getting any metal splinters. Overall, I'm glad I have it."
5,What a wonderully crafted instrument!,"I ordered this for my 3-yr old grandson. It arrived very promptly and it is beautiful. Very dark grainy wood with perfectly inset panels of lighter wood that form the ends. Lovely tone, plays easily, sounds delightful! Unfortunally it is so very sweet-sounding that it won't drive his mother Nutz... which is always a goal in my house! (And now I'm ordering another for my grandaughter.)"
5,Great source of information!!,"This book is a great resource because there is information about all areas of robotics and it's all in one place. I like this book a lot because it isn't information that is readily available on the internet (unlike the Sourcebook). The robot projects are a lot of fun and they are original. This is a classic, ""must have"" for the serious robot builder!!"
3,Newer Version Available of this Above Average book,"I'm surprised that amazon doesn't recognize that there is a 3rd edition of this book available. If you decide you want this book, at least get the most recent version which supposedly has some better information in it. This is a fairly good book for robots with some good over views, but i found it lacking in lots of areas for programming and electronics. i do intend to check out the new version from the library and see if its any better now."
1,Poorly written,"This book is all tired re-hash from the first edition. Very incorrect mechanical drawings, most of the circuits don't work, poorly researched with many error! This book will frustrate you so much, you'd be better off buying a book on origami :-) Some of the newer authors have got it right - try books by Myke Predko, John Iovine or Karl Williams - way better."
1,Un-original and boring,This is Rehash of the first edition - same boring material regurgitated back at you. It's like taking ugly red-headed step-child and trying to dye his hair black but the roots and the freckles show through the disguise - still ugly and red-headed - like this book. This author can't take any critisism - don't worry - he'll cry like a little baby to amazon offical and this will get taken down. I try to warn you that this book won't be loved to dog ears - it sit on shelf and become dust bunny catcher because the circuits are wrongness and the most don't go well.
3,Treo phone case,"All the reviews I have read pretty much sum up the case. It is personal preference. Yes the belt clip is VERY difficult to use but hoping with time it won't be so difficult to use. What is nice about the clip is it is not bulky like some can be and you don't have to worry about it breaking or losing a piece. Knowing when I purchased it that it would add bulk when clipped to my belt or when I put it in my purse, the case is exactly what I expected and am satisfied with it. I have to say though I have to watch which way I put the phone in the case because otherwise it pushes the on button even in the lock position."
5,Best Case Yet,"This is the best phone or palm case I have owned. It has not broke when getting in my car, nor has it ever fallen off my belt. The magnetic closure is the easiest I have used. It's looks have held up well this past year."
3,Not the best,"I'm not sure about this product, maybe I was expecting a miracle. It doesn't take the dirt, scum, etc. out without a lot of scrubbing. You have to make sure you rinse it completley, otherwise it leaves a white residue. Not the best."
5,"Great teacher, great book",I was lucky enough to know Father Lavin personally. He was my high school art teacher and had a profound impact on me. The advice he offers here would be hard to take if you did not know how long and hard he fought for the inspiration. He was a man of hidden depths and you can enjoy them here.
5,stevie at his best,WAITED A LONG TIME FOR SOMETHING I HADNT HEARD BEFORE AND SOME OF THE NUMBERS WERE NEW TO ME. MIND YOU IT WOULDNT MATTER WHAT HE PLAYED IT WAS ALWAYS GREAT. SO SAD THAT THERE WONT BE ANY MORE. REST IN PEACE STEVIE RAY
4,Great for the SRV fan,"I heard a few cuts from this album and decided to buy it. It has some great sessions on it but alot of it is very slow and bluesy. If you're looking for 'peppy' SRV songs, this album probably isn't it."
4,music lover,"it has some great songs, but it is not what I had anticipated. I guess I should have read the label on the songs a little better. I wanted more Stevie!"
2,someone should be ashamed!,"Talk about pillaging the legacy of the great Stevie Ray Vaughan! The record company takes a few previously unreleased tunes (which are available on bootlegs), tacks on a few more duets, and then prices it a damn near $20.00 with tax. There have been some excellent releases from Vaughan's vaults, but this is not one of them by a longshot. Save your money and pass this rip off up. Shame on whoever put this out."
1,Enough!,This release is just another example of record companies desperation to make money off of SRV. Yes there are a few good songs but enough is enough.
1,just plain bad,"save you cash, this is just another gimmic to make bucks off what belonged on the shelf. I'm sure there is something in the archives that could better this, but this is shameful to release..."
2,Hopes Dashed,"Well it is not what I hoped for at all! I have to agree with the others, do not waste your money for the one or two good tunes. Go buy ""Before the Music Dies"""
3,RAITT ruined this one !,"I think Bonnie Raitt totally ruined ""Texas Flood"" on this one. She sounds way off key from SRV. YUCK !"
3,Just enjoy it,"What is wrong with some of these people? I don't think Stevie Ray is coming out of his grave to put out any new material. Enjoy it for what it is, material from the vault that most people haven't heard. Hendrix stuff has been coming out almost 40 years after his death. Zappa has almost 200 hours of material stashed away. The record companies suck, it's true, but this is for the hardcore fan. Stop bitching. I don't normally post but some of you guys are ridiculous."
4,Some Gems,"This is worth having for the incendiary playing not least on Going Down with Jeff Beck, you can see the video of this on You Tube - amazing!"
5,"One of the best albums of this fantastic lady, availible","About this Kay Starr Album: She has A full rich voice with total command, with almost all her charted hits from 1948 to 1952. She is one of my listeners favorites and this CD is one of my favorites also. Every one of the 28 songs on this album have been remastered to the utmost quality.This CD produced by ""Living Era"" is of super quality. Typical of this label which was produced by Ray Crick in 2003. It's a shame this recording company went out of business a few years back.I posess well over 150 of ""Living Era"" Albums in my music library, including this one. I have been doing radio for over 55 years and this is one of the finest labels ever produced for us music lovers. You Can't go wrong here.Brian Lee HartWVUD RadioNewark Delaware"
1,TV Pass,"TV Pass? Does it work for you? I tried it twice and sat and waited and waited and waited. Try finding Amazon help? Good luck. Heard this was an excellent episode of ""Boston Legal"" - guess I will wait until it comes out on dvd and then purchase it from - NOT Amazon!"
5,I Love Tara,I fell in love with Tara Summers the first time I saw her. Hercompassion and tender caring almost brought me to tears. I onlyhope Ms. Summers is as captivating as Katie the character sheportrays. I have her pictures decorating my home. Is there anyway I could ever meet her in person?
5,GREAT ACTORS GREAT SHOW,"LOVE BOSTON LEGAL SLICK WRITING. AND THE CHARACTERS. HOW GOOD WITH JAMES SPADER,AND CAPT KIRK OF COURSE A LITTLE WISER,FUNNY, AND OLDER.GREAT SHOW. HEY JUDGE JUDY LIKES IT!!! SHE SAID SO."
3,Denny Crane's last hurrah,"David E. Kelley's writing, when focused on political or social issues, is still brilliant in this final season of Boston Legal. The bits that used to be comic relief in the previous seasons, though, have taken center stage, and cast a dark shadow over the deeper ideologies presented.We're left scratching our heads as to why the scripts spend so much time on William Shatner's character, Denny Crane and his increasingly adolescent behavior. Perhaps this is why ABC canceled the show.The acting continues to be fun, especially James Spader as Alan Shore, but it is dragged down by the sophomoric pranks and thoughts of Denny Crane. I enjoy a good dirty joke as much as the next red-blooded American, but to waste the soapbox that David E. Kelley created with the sexual yearnings of an aging, diseased lawyer seems moronic.Still more entertaining than most shows, it misses the mark of the previous seasons, in my opinion."
3,bigoted and racist shirley?,"let me begin by stating i absolutely love the 'boston legal' series- i think it was one of the best shows to ever be on television. however, this last season left a nasty taste in my mouth because out of nowhere, our heroine shirley schmidt turns into a complete racist against chinese people when a chinese company attempts to buy the law firm. the bigoted comments we would expect out of denny crane's mouth, but for the other heros of the show to follow suit was just too much. the idea for the episode may have been a good discussion, but the execution seemed incredibly anti-china and did not present both sides of the story as BL does so well in other episodes. As the american people takes its cue from how to feel about the outside world, i find it irresponsible that the writers would be so racist in this final season. (the abortion episode which was also incredibly anti-china)"
1,Irresponsible Garbage,Could have been acceptable w/o the Liberal Agenda Hype.Give me a break. Give everybody a break!I will not watch any more of this trash.
2,Time to go,Enjoyed the first two seasons but then the writers began using the show to push every left wing agenda they could think of. If I want liberal political commentary then I'll watch MSNBC. Keep it out of a formerly good comedy/drama
1,I love Boston Legal but this season....,This season stinks. It is preachy with no punchline. It seems tired and worn. I enjoy the Denny Crane/Alan Shore relationship but the writing just seems to take that dynamic for granted in season 5. The increased appearances by Melvin Palmer doesn't help either. That character is best in really small doses. Seeing Jerry all the time is a bit annoying as well.All in all... I'd kinda like a refund. Maybe Alan Shore will take my case :-)
5,Fantastic!,"We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this show! We are so sad this is the last season, we have them all! We are pacing ourselves watching, so it will last longer!"
5,Boston Legal Season Five,"One of the best tv series of our times!! funny,sarcastic, eye opening, drama, everything. Sad too see it gone."
3,"Brilliant at first, but then as with everything, went downhill","The series is one of my all time TV favorites. Brilliant, funny, sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek, poignant... but the last season really did deem to devolve (sadly and unexpectedly) nothing more than a political party soapbox. I know some loved it, but I consider that a sad shame."
5,Good show,This was a late Christmas gift for my husband. He enjoys the show very much and we are looking forward to receiving the series.
4,EXCELENTE SERVICIO,"Un servicio muy bueno, rápido y de calidad. El producto vino bien envuelto y protegido, muy cuidado y en excelentes condiciones. Llegó dentro del plazo esperado. Buen trabajo!"
2,disappointing,i have all 5 seasons and this last one had just a few laughs and was to political and a real disapointment
5,"Wow - Exciting, Interestering, and Fun to Read!","I am a huge Alias fan. I found this book to be a great addition to my Alias collection. The book is very interesting with details about the characters, actors, design sets, and just about everything. I was interested in how some of the actors and actresses have kind of created their own characters behind the ""script"". It was a very fun and exciting read. I would reccomend this to anyone who is a fan of alias. You will not be disappointed as this book is entertaining AND informative, which is quite hard to find these days. If you enjoy Alias, you will love this book."
5,Amazing behind-the-scenes look at the show!,"I loved reading about things like the costume design, set design, and all of the other things that go into making a show like this. It was a wonderful book to read as an Alias fan, but it would also be amazing for new fans because it even includes an episode guide to the entire first season! Plus, several thousand of them come with a DVD! The DVD is awesome because it contains cast interviews, clips from the show, character profiles and cast biographies! This book is highly recommended for anyone with an interest in the show!"
5,Great book,Excellent book. I think all the other reviews sum it all up. I love the DVD and the show is great! A must have for any fan!
2,Growing Up with Winnie The Pooh,The video is very cute about how to treat friends. I bought for my four year old grandson but my eight year old grandson enjoys too.
3,Disney repackaged,"This Video contains four episodes from ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" the charming animated series on the Disney Channel that captured both kids and their parents with all-new outings featuring Pooh and the whole gang in the 100 Acre Wood.1. Goodbye Mr. Pooh - Original Air Date: 3/4/1989 - this episode is also on the Video ""Pooh's Wishes""2.

Pooh Skies - Original Air Date: 10/6/1990 - this episode is also on the Video ""Imagine that, Christopher Robin"""
3,growing up with Winnie the Pooh,I didn't like the used dvd because it froze up alot. My 2 year old twins cried everytime it froze up.
5,Very good Price!,"I ordered this for my daughter and she loves it! I didnt think that it was a bad price for 4 episodes of winnie the pooh. The only disapointing thing I found was that it does not have the orginal theme song, but over all its a really really good deal and very cute!"
3,Ok,Well I Received This Item And For The First 10 Mins It Was Scratched SO Had To Fast Forward To The Middle To watch
4,The Swankster,"The Band of Brothers was an enthralling tale of heroism and comradery, warfare and combat. It combines all your senses into one tantelizing story, done by the perfect author, Stephen Ambrose. He brings you right beside of the soldiers of the 101st. You are able to become friends with the characters, with Ambrose's unique style of writing. If you are interested in World War II this is the perfect book for you, highlighting every aspect of the American soldier during the 1940's"
2,Disappointed,"I read this book in 3 days, having waited to watch any of the HBO show until I had finished reading the story behind it. I have yet to watch the show, but I hope it is better than the book. While I usually enjoy WWII books, this one disappointed me. The stories set around individual soldiers or small groups were quite good, being told from the stories that Ambrose gathered from those very men. Where the book falls short is in the description of the major movements of the troops. His descriptions are confusing and he uses some abbreviations that a person not familiar with the military may be confused by. Ambrose could have put a little more effort into better explaining these battles. Adding the maps into the chapters they applied to would also have helped. Would have like to see more photos also. It is still a decent read, but disappointed me."
5,Best WWII book I've read,"In Band of Brothers, Stephen Ambrose shows a remarkable ability to suck the reader right into the story. He does a wonderful job of letting the reader get to know the soldiers on a personal level.....to the point that if the reader were to actually meet one of these soldiers, he would instantly feel like he has known him for years. The best thing about this book is the fact that it presents war from a personal view, rather than the typical cold, sterile, narrative format of most other history books. Reading this book will bring back memories for many people, and for others, make them wish they had such memories and bonds."
4,Readable History,"I've watched the HBO series based on the book at least five times so most of the information in the book was not new to me. But I was waiting for a book I had ordered to arrive and needed something to read.The book was well written and interesting. I enjoyed the story of the truly courageous and inspiring men who left their lives as young adults to fight for the freedom of others. Ambrose is a thorough researcher and has a knack for writing about the battles.Now, I've got to watch the movies again."
2,Okay if your not expecting very much,"The book was readable... I mean it was worth the penny I had spent on it. It also beat going to the store and buying a new one. Although, needless to say if had not needed this book for a school book report theirs no way in hell I would ever buy a book from this seller again. Unless I am doing another book report of course."
5,EXCELLENT!!,"Saw the series, own the series, bought the book, started buying all the books on the subject. I am a WWII history buff & military history & tactics major while in the military. CAN'T get enough. Great research and portrayals!"
5,Very Compelling,Makes you appreciate the sacrifices of those who go to war to insure and protect our freedoms. Outstanding story and writing.
5,Band of Brothers Review,"I thought this book was interesting and unique in every way.It was so good, I wasn't able to put the book down until the end. Band of Brothers explains in great detail what WWII was like in creative fashion. I recommend it for any teen or adult to read."
4,Outstanding tale of WWII,"Historian Stephen Ambrose, shortly before writing his book on the D-Day invasion (""D-Day: June 6th, 1944"") took the time to write ""Band of Brothers"", the story of the men of E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. The soldiers who fought in this unit saw nearly the entire war in Europe- the Normandy invasion, to the ferocious fighting of Operation Market-Garden (the Allies risky strike into Holland), to the Battle of the Bulge, to the collapse of the German Army in April of 1945.Fans of military history will find Ambrose's book illuminating. The unit had its tensions with foolish officers and its experiences in the war were pretty rough. Many didn't return from the crusade for freedom in Europe. Read ""Band of Brothers"" and remember those who gave their lives."
4,"A Review of ""Band of Brothers""","In his book ""Band of Brothers"" Stephen Ambrose tells the story of C Company, 506 PIR, 101st Airborne. He starts with how the company came to gather and moves on to their battle in Normandy, Belgium, Germany and Austria. Ambrose does a very good job writing this book. He uses quotes from interviews of the members of the Company in the book. This book shows how; throw determination, well, loyalty, self-discipline and personal courage, normal people from across the country can come to gather and defeat evil and keep this country free. I would recomind this book to anyone and to read any of Stephen Ambrose's books."
5,Great and interesting,"This was the first book that I read from Mr. Ambrose, after I saw the HBO series. And the book blew me away, even there was not much the book brought forth, because the series was quite a truthfull adaption of the book. My grandpa, who died in the early 80`s, was also a paratrooper, unfortunately on the side of the Germans. All I knew about the war was, that he and his comrades had to endure a very hard training (they were kicked out of the plane, if they didn`t want to jump etc.). So it was very interesting to read what it was like to jump fro a plane sometimes into hell itself. Unfortunately Mr. Ambrose isn`t still with us , so that I could thank him personally for the information which I couldn`t get from my grandpa, because of his early death. A must read for everybody who`s interested in WWII."
2,Disappointed,"I found the HBO series rivetting...so I rushed out and bought the book. Speilberg and Hanks tell a much better story than Ambrose, even if they glossed over the truth a bit. In the series, the soldiers do come off as real heros. In the book, they just seem like whiners. I was surprised at how much Captain Winters goes on and on in the book badmouthing officers both above and below him in rank. In his opinion only Captain Spears and himself seem to be worthy of any credit for the 101st's achievments. It get's tiring hearing soldiers go on at length about the greatness of their company. The producers of the series were right to minimze this...it just seems tachy to be still complaining about other soldiers 50 years later.The letters of a private Webster are quoted at length, simply copied page after page into the book, so much so that his name should have be under Ambrose's on the cover."
4,As good as his others,"Dreamed about foxholes and shells every night as I read this. Very good book, just as good as the more acclaimed ""D-Day"" and ""Citizen Soldiers."" While those were more grand in scope, ""Band of Brothers"" may be more compelling because it follows essentially the same cast of characters through their Odyssey instead of jumping around to different divisions, nationalities, etc. Doesn't cover up the drinking, loafing, back-company pilfering, shooting of prisoners, looting, occasional insubordination, acts of cowardice & stupidity, etc. I was a little disappointed that Ambrose ripped only on the dead (namely Capt. Sobel) and glorified all those who are still alive. But overall a wonderful book. I don't want to glorify war--I would've hated to fight in any war, including WWII (which ended 25 yrs. before I was born), but if I had to fight I would've wanted to fight in the airborne under Major Winters."
5,Better than the HBO series!,This was a great book. If you have watched the HBO series and loved that then get the book and love it more.
4,Great beach book,This was an enjoyable read for the history enthusiast. Like much of Ambrose work it focuses on the human interest rather than drowning you in details.
5,"Amazing, moving, remarkable.","I had the rare opportunity to meet the real MAJ Winters and even share a dinner table with him. Based on this experience I can share with you all that Mr. Ambrose has done a remarkable job of capturing the essense of this warrior in text. This book was one of those rare ""can't put downs"" that you only happen upon a few times. I strongly recommend this book to both WWII buffs and those who are just starting to learn about the war. You will doubtlessly gain insight into the suffering, trials, and triumphs of those great men who did battle for all of us fifty years ago."
4,Fast and interesting read,"Steven Ambrose is the historian for the masses. He writes in a concise manner that anyone can breeze thru but uses a fair amount of imagry to create a novel instead of a history book. Obviously, watching the mini-series is much more enjoyable after reading this book. The greatest reason this is true is the knowledge of all the names/identies so when the directors accent certain events, you aren't trying to understand what, who or when. If you're a history buff, WWII dork, or like me (little bit of both) you'll want to read this book."
5,WWII for the Casual or Serious History Buff,"My interests in military history have gravitated more towards the Vietnam and Korean conflicts. Not because I don't like WWII, but because any time War is discussed these days, it is likely to be either the Gulf War or WWII. This book changed all that for me. Stephen Ambrose's reputation caused me to purchase this book, and he lives up to it in a big way with this book. The narrative style of this book makes it read like a suspense or mystery novel. He does a wonderful job of developing the men's backgrounds and their development as soldiers and a cohesive unit. It allows you to sense some of the pain that their comrades must have felt when some of them were inevitably lost. Mr. Ambrose does a good job of drawing the reader into what it was like for these men--as much as it can be done for a reader, particularly one who has not seen combat. I recommend this book to anyone interested in studying warfare, WWII, or just looking for a good patriotic reading."
1,Good....But Not The Best,"I'll hand it to Ambrose....this is a pretty good book. I don't think a hundred books about small units of the 101st and 82nd could really ever get me there, but ""Band of Brothers"" is a decent attempt. A semi-personal account such as this is pretty entertaining, but for a gut feel of what it is like up close, read Donald Burgett's excellent set or my personal favorite, the unparalleled ""Those Devils In Baggy Pants"" by the late Ross S. Carter."
2,Great tale marred by rah-rah style,"What these guys went through and accomplished is simplyastounding. However, the style of the book alternatesbetween unchecked cheerleading and dry ""field report""excerpts. I read this immediately after ""We Were SoldiersOnce, And Young"" and found the other book to be muchbetter written, even though this one is by a known ""good""author. There are plenty of great WWII books and moviesout there. This book ain't one of them."
2,Rent the DVD,"I picked up ""Band of Brothers"" for two reasons: first, I have been hearing for years what a great historian Stephen Ambrose was; second, I loved the HBO series and thought the book would provide deeper insights into the men of Easy Company and their WWII experience. How surprised I was to discover just the opposite. Ambrose may have been a great historian, but he was no writer. Incidents that in the series were presented with drama and suspense were written of in a flat-footed, perfunctory manner. What I came away with most after reading ""Band of Brothers"" was less respect for Ambrose and more for the producers and writers of the series, who so successfully fleshed out Ambrose's skeletal text. I don't think I've ever said this before, but skip the book and rent the movie."
5,A must for my book collection,I was crushed when I learned that a dog ate my first copy (loaned out). I bought another and read it immediately to find some that I missed the other two times I read it. Of course I have the HBO collection as well!
4,Very good WWII - the HBO series is very close.,"I actually read this after seeing the HBO series. The HBO series is very close to the book. The book has a little more to it. Great docu-movie on WWII following the 101st Airborne. Not just war scenes (which are very good), but you get into the thoughts and lives of the troops."
3,citizen soldiers part II,"While Band of Brothers is well-written, I made the mistake of reading it immediately after finishing Ambrose's book Citizen Soldiers. While the latter was excellent and cannot be praised highly enough, I had a sense of deja vu while reading Band of Brothers. Quite of few of the stories were duplicated. Unfortunately, Band of Brothers comes across as a sequel.That said, Band of Brothers is an enjoyable book and Ambrose is a good writer. However, I believe that Citizen Soldiers is a significantly better book.My only real complaint about the book is the constant praising of one of the soldiers (Winters). While the soldiers were uniformly brave and extremely competent, the praise does go a bit over the top. Continuous repetition tends to be counter-productive."
5,Excellent in depth review of the 101st Airborne in WWII,"This book, as I have come to expect from Ambrose, was another engrossing and descriptive account of WWII infantry combat. This book explores the ordeals of several colorful characters- some heroes, some some not. The mix of first hand accounts, quotes, and battle summaries provides for an interesting and informative book. Highly recommended for people interested in WWII, infantry combat, etc."
4,Great Complement To HBO Series,"Like millions, I am enjoying the HBO series, 'Band of Brothers'. To expand my enjoyment, and learn more about Easy Company, I listened to the audio version of the book. It is a great complement to the series. The tape demonstrates HBO is following the true heroics of these soldiers. It adds more information and reveals deeper emotions than these excellent actors can portray. The narration accentuates the action and miseries. Sure, we can replay our video tapes. I recommend you buy the tape and discover more enjoyment and appreciation for E Company and their sacrifices."
5,"B.O.B., A great book",This book opened my eyes to WWII. This was not what I learned in 8th grade. This book takes you through the war with real men that you can connect with. These men take you step by step with their feelings. I loved the book and recommend it for everyone.
1,Tony Bate's Review Right On!,"Anthony Bates couldn't have said it better. It's shocking that so many readers out there just gobble up Ambrose's ""feel good history"" as unquestionable fact, when in reality what Ambrose writes little more than entertainment for ignorant readers. Everything Bate's mentions is true...the fact that other less fabled, yet equally brave and crucial formations that served in Bastogne get ignored by Ambrose is shameful. Also, his knowledge of the German Army in all of his writings is down right pathetic and revolves more around old 'folk lore' than any type of dedicated research. Ambrose does know how write an compelling story, I'll give him that...although there is a lot of better academic history out there, and it is not very hard to find."
3,Does not live up to its billing,Book starts off as interesting but then slows and its hard to stay interested
5,Awesome book,I would recomend reading the book before seeing the miniseries. Even though both are very very good. The book tells the stories of Easy Company in world war II.They begin in the united states for training then are gone to britain and eventually to the dday jump in 1944. this book shows the coming together of ordinary men. by the end of the war they know everything about each other. i would like to thank ambrose and all of the e company soldiers that helped put this book and eventually this miniseries on dvd which i have for making them. just think this is just one company's doing in world war II. imagine all the other hundreds of companies there are.Curahee
5,Fantastic!,"I don't find a need to summarize this book. However, I will say the book is excellent! One of the best books I've read about the common soldier in Europe. Ambrose's writing is superb - he makes all of the characters come alive as we follow their induction into the Army and their arrival at Fort Toccoa and their training with Capt. Sobel. We follow the guys to England as they get ready to depart for Normandy. The book continues with their jumps into Holland and later, Bastogne. Since we've followed the troops and have come to know them well, there is a sense of sadness at the war's end that these band of brothers are disbanding. The ""where are they now"" at the end of the book is quite poignant. The book is not heavy on facts and is somewhat light reading but it's one that is hard to put down."
5,Band of Brothers,"This is the best book I have read on small unit actions in World War II. Ambrose has set the standard for others to follow. The soldiers in this book are real, I had the pleasure of meeting the 1SG while stationed at Fort Bragg, NC. With 18 years of service in the Army with experience in Armor, Infantry, Artillery and a History Degree this book is flawless. I had the honor of commanding a company in the 82nd Airborne Division and made this book a manditory read for my Lieutenants professional development. The brilliance of Ambrose as an author is his blending of accurate history and technical authenticity without sacrificing the bond between soldiers; the human side often missing in history books. If you love this book you must read Pegasus Bridge and Citizen Soldiers by the same author. Can't wait until his next book!"
5,A great read,"I bought and read this book several years ago, and loved it. It is an easy read (no pun intended), and really describes the bond between these elite citizen soldiers. And it is a wonderful homage to these great men. After buying the DVD series ""Band Of Brothers"" I decided to re-read Ambrose's book. This book was even better the second time around. True accounts are much better than fiction, and the late Stephen Ambrose will stand as one of the great American historians. I recommend reading this book, then watching the mini-series and then re-reading the book. If you were stirred by the mini-series, you will be inspired by the book."
2,Band of Brothers,"It is like most other books about WAR, the author does not followthe factual events, but tells a good story.The 101st was one of the last Amertican units to reach the Eagle's Nest. The 15th Inf. Regt. 3rd Inf.Div. (Audie Murphy's unitt) was the first American unit to reach it and a French unit at the same time. The 101st came in much later, but joined in the party or what was left. The book has many such NON-FACTS in it, just to make for a good story.I am author of military books and retired Army.Sgt.Maj."
4,Great Book,"I think ""Band of Brothers'' was a great book. It had a great story. The men in Easy Company and 101st Airborne were a huge help in the success of the battle at Normandy. I would recommend reading this book the everyone in the whole world. It shows bravery, courage and heart all in this one book."
4,Well written and researched.,I read this book after watching the series and I am glad I did as it provides a bit more information and confirms that the series did a good job of sticking to the story line.
4,Comradery in cobat is shared by WWW II Survivors,"Mr. Ambrose has written on a a much examined topic of the closeness and bonds formed from the shared experience of combat preparation and combat itself. He does so with the help of some very brave veterans, who not only faced the terror of warfare but the fear of sharing with the public what they feel. The story is well written, enligtening and enjoyable. The only draw back is the author's tendency to magnify the accomplishments of one group of fighting men to make them seem above the extraordinary of other GI's in the same war."
4,Band of Brothers,"A great book about the 101st airborne and their aations in the downfall of Nazi Germany. A more in depth version of the HBO series. A great story of American men and how they grew to be brothers while they fought through Europe. Contains first hand accounts of major battles including D-Day, Bastogne, and the Battle of the Bulge. An amazing read, by the end of the book you come to feel as if you know the men you are reading about. I highly reccomend it for anyone interested in World War II."
5,Better than HBO,I enjoyed reading this book very much. It is very well written and provides a level of detail not available in the HBO series (although I enjoyed that too). Anyone interested in the 101st Airborne during WWII would be happy with this account.
4,Miniseries vs. Book,"This may be the first time I enjoyed the movie (the HBO miniseries) more than the book. ""Band of Brothers"" is a very straightforward record drawn from personal accounts from the paratroopers of E Company and other sources. Stephen Ambrose lacks the style and wit of Edmund Morris, the last author I read. However, many will prefer the simplicity of Ambrose's ""just the facts"" approach. I especially appreciated the personal detail he extracted in face to face interviews. He shares these very candidly. No punches pulled here. The reader is treated to the feeling that he is more than acquainted with the soldiers of E Company. The book includes interesting background and personal detail not included in the miniseries. A watching audience would view them as tedious. However, the book lacks the visceral impact of the visuals in the miniseries. My advice? Watch the miniseries AND read the book. They complement each other very well. Rating: 4 of 5"
5,Read all the series,"I liked it because it is an amazing story. Saw HBO's series. With maps an photographs which help you to fully understand the story. Handy edition, good quality of paper, well written with personal testimonies. It is a different approach to History account. Consider that I'm not an american citizen and I perfectly followed the events."
4,Solid!,This is fine work about the 506TH(PIR) and the 101st Airborne Division. In most accounts I always favor the book and this is no exception. Good details about the training in Camp Toccoa and trng in England in prep for Operation Overlord very detailed in the fights of Easy company the changes of leadership throughout there campaign's Kudous to the authour.
3,"Good quality, on time delivery","I purchased this second hand book a short while ago, it took a little bit of time getting to me but ONLY because it was being shipped internationally. The book is in very good condition.The book it's self is well written and I am enjoying it so far, I originally purchased the book because I love the TV series so much, if you are looking at reading this book I suggest you also check out the show"
5,Enjoyable; Educational,"This is a ""must"" read. I found it captivating. I now understand the tight relationships that are bonded when training intensely and then fighting together. Becoming ""brothers"" is a a key to military success."
2,"An entertaining book, a better miniseries","An entertaining book that lent itself well to an excellent miniseries. The brief and very shallow source section at the end of the book did little to enhance the text and made it impossible to know exactly what historical research was done other than oral interviews. My inquiring mind requires more substance concerning Ambrose's research. The book kept ones interest fairly well although I found it fairly basic. A good, light read. but if what you're looking for something with some real depth and historic data, this book isn't it. . .kind of like Ambrose gone Hollywood."
5,"A must read for ""history buffs""","Ambrose will take you to the fox holes of WW11 Europe and put you next to the men who occupy them. He gets you to know and care about the men of Easy company and admire their courage and honor. you will get to know men who would rather die themselves than to let their ""Bothers""down. The way Ambrose combines eyewitness accounts and historical facts make this book a must read for ""history buffs""."
5,What a Book!,I think it would be insulting for anyone to give this book less than a 5 star rating..........
1,thoroughly disappointing,"Watch the mini series, skip the book.If you are a fan of history, and I'm certain you are if you're reading this review, skip this book. Read Rick Atkinson, or Dick Winters' account, anything, just skip this book.The writing was high school quality, a poor job by the editors (apparently the atomic bomb was ""dripped"" on Hiroshima), and the story is short on the details that make reading historical accounts interesting.Enjoy the mini series, but if you're interested in this topic, find another book."
1,"Please, not another Ambrose-paint by numbers book!","Drivel.Pure drivel.If one wishes the honest re-telling of history & not self-serving distortion or histrionic hyperbole, stay away from Stephen Ambrose. After reading a few of his books I crown him the Jackie Collins of historical fiction.Why one star? It's the lowest rating they offer."
1,Rating the kindle price,"The Kindle prices is more than the paperback. Get your act together on these digital book prices. Since there is not paper or printing costs, the price of this book can easily be set to a lower price than a printed copy."
2,Disappointing Hagiography,"A rather silly and superficial telling of a military group of paratroupers. Names come and go and an officer named Winters is idolized. He doesn't drink, doesn't curse, kills Germans by the dozens and even takes time to comfort new replacements. Save your money and check out the TV series."
4,"Interesting topic, very readable",Was hooked after watching the TV series. Is quite readable and a comprehensive record of Easy Company. It's a good intro into WWII.
4,Good book for Veterans!,"Bought this book for my grandfather, a Paratrooper...and he really enjoyed this book. I would have given it 5 stars, but I didn't read it myself."
5,the Screaming Eagles..,"A well-written, gripping story of the Screaming Eagles, E Co, 506th regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagles Nest. Stephen E. Ambrose writes with so much respect and admiration for this Band of Brothers and I was enthralled by the men of Easy Co and their story. America's greatness and spirit can be found through the actions of these men and what they did for their country. We were blessed to have them in WWII and their story is the stuff of legends."
4,Powerful,"Although the book loses its clarity at times(Ambrose seems to struggle with the Battle of the Bulge), the solid beginning and heart-warming end put this book on my must read list. Ambrose once again proves that he is the master of oral history, a strong writer who puts war, on both a strategic and personal level, into perspective.But the true strength of the book comes from its wonderful sense of chronology. As you follow the Company's triumphs and tragedies, from the training camp at Toccoa to the mountains of Austria, you form a strange bond between yourself and the men of Company E. Only at the end of the book, when a lonely soldier comments that he is the last member of the original company, did I appreciate its emotional influence."
4,BEAUTIFULL,"THE MOMENT I SAW THIS SET ON YOUR SITE, I THOUGHT IT WAS BEAUTIFULL. WE ARE GETTING MARRIED NEXT YEAR, SO I PURCHASED IT AND I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED IN IT'S BEAUTY."
1,Not what i needed:( now am stuck with it,"It mite be a good book for some people just not for me,Suppose to be for Antique books,but does not have anything about year 1611.."
1,Title Misleading,"I bought, then returned this book. It may be a fine book for some but the word ""Antique"" in the title is deceptive. I am interested in antique books. Considering the fact that books have been published for centuries, a shotgun listing of books of relatively recent vintage may serve some well but was useless to me. Sorry, Mr. Russell. Better lose the ""Antique Trader"" title if you have another printing."
1,Poorly Organized,"This book was not what I expected at all. It is difficult to navigate through, and isn't organized very well. If you want to research a certain book inside this book, you literally have to play the guessing game on deciding what section of this book it is in since the table of contents is labeled, ""Children's books, Americana, Horror, banned"". Also, he lists several books in multiple sections of the book, all with different information. Most importantly, I think the author chose a poor way to organize his information and he should have just used the classic approach: an index. I would not recommend this book."
2,Warmed over info readily available elsewhere,"I bought this book hoping that it would add something new to the information available on book collecting. As a collector of antiquarian tomes for three decades, I am always interested in looking at books of this nature.But this book disappoints. It's a mishmash of lists and information readily available elsewhere. The author is listening to some inner sense of direction which has little to do with the real book market or those who collect.To be honest, any book that gives a list of collectible books has limited value. Any such list or lists are based on a single author's opinions. The world of books is far too complicated for a single volume to fill any real need. The Ahern volumes come closest.If you are interesting in finding collectible books, you'd be far better off with the Ahern or McBride guides. In thened, this book will only disappoint."
1,Quick doesn't have to mean processed,I like flavor! I love to eat good food! And I am all about saving time but come on- does this mean I have to use so much tasteless processed food! Very disappointing.
3,Unrelenting,"Very good story, but definitely early James Lee Burke. The main character is strongly done, but some of the secondary characters could use more depth. It is interesting to see the development of the young James. Toward the end of the novel the humanity of the central characters is displayed amidst a brutal conflict, with vicious acts by both sides of the conflict. In the end it is vintage James Lee Burke with his clear view of a flawed, moral man attempting to walk his own path through the craters of his families and communities circumstances. Well worth the read."
1,Poor effort,"As a child I grew up in eastern Kentucky and I am a huge fan of James Lee Burke. However I was very disappointed in both the literary quality of this novel as well as the depiction of life in the mid 20th century coal fields of Kentucky. The main character, Perry, was not developed at all and the same descriptive words were used over and over again."
2,Too unrelenting or not enough,I normally enjoy books by James Lee Burke but I must admit that I did not find this very enjoyable. It dragged a bit and it just didn't feel very satisfying in the end. A bit too unrelenting for me . . . .
1,Really Bad ...Period!,About as poor a novel as I've read in a long time. I chose to read the entire piece even though it was tedious beyond belief in the hope that at some point my selection of a kindle JLB novel would be shown to be more than stupid. I failed. The ending is so poor I can only conclude Mr. Burk took some piece of long ago unfinished trash where in he was attempting an exercise in description of squalor and ignorance and slapped on an ending. The hope being by trading upon his literary status to create enough income to make a down payment on a new kitchen. My conclusion ... some writing is better burned by it's author shortly after inception.
4,"A classic mystery, with a riddling plot . . .","John Dickson Carr is a great mystery writer from the era of Ellery Queen and other masters. This book involves a murder that takes place on a tennis court-- the wire mesh fencing around the court is the ""wire cage"" of the title. This is one of those murders which ""could not possibly have been committed"" but was. The riddle type mystery involves interesting characters who have all sorts of dynamics going-- passionate love, old hatreds, rivalries, and so forth. If you like the sort of mystery that challenges you to identify the killer, this one's for you. It's great to see some of these classics in print."
2,A good novel spoiled by weak explanation,"This novel is an enjoyable story until the solution, which is completely disappointing. The explanation of the impossible crime is one of Carr's weakest; it leaves the reader thinking ""That would _never_ work."""
2,A weak outing,"I can only hope that this is a particularly poor example of Carr's work. From the lumbering setup--two notches below a bad episode of ""Diagnosis Murder""--to the stretch of a solution, ""The Problem of the Wire Cage"" tries hard but fails to impress, having all of the characteristics of a modern mystery potboiler, back before the cliches were cliches. Carr's dialog is snappy, and his writing can be nicely descriptive, but he seems intent on using genre conventions (e.g., the old ""one of you here is the murderer"" line), and the story never livens up as a result. I wanted to like this book, but the flashes of the author's charm were few and far between."
2,Pricey Insurance,"Installed one of these in fall of 2009. It failed two weeks ago (July 2012). Being somewhat ""handy"" when it comes to fixing things I thought I'd see what the problem might be. The problem was that the green power light would not illuminate even though the power feed was fine. Took it apart and looked the printed circuit board over and saw nothing unusual. It looked like a $10-$20 circuit board and so checked around for a replacement board. No can do. Paid something in the neighborhood of $150 for this thing and got 2 years service out of it. Now they're more like $200. Gave it the old heave ho and installed a manual shut off valve, also made by Watts. With this manual valve (both lines shut off with one flick of the lever) and some extra heavy duty hoses going to the washer I think we'll have much better and less costly ""insurance"". Good thing I can do my own plumbing or I'd really be upset. I don't recall if I got mine at Amazon, but it did come from a .com store."
2,Reliability problems (twice),"My second Intelliflow in 6 years failed today; the hot water valve stopped opening; Same problem on the first one (except it was the cold valve).When it works, it works great, but as other reviewers have noted, there is no easy way to bypass a failed unit. I spent the morning on a minor plumbing project (sweating a new standard valve onto the pipes) just so I could do a load of laundry.I'm not going to buy a third; I'll probably take some other steps to mitigate water damage risk."
1,NIghtmare after nightmare with Miele big machines,"This thing has caused me untold nightmares. It keeps shutting off my Miele washing machine...one of the new Miele big front loaders. I have to go for weeks without it working. Now I am having to reset it every time. It is horrible, horrible. A nightmare. Miele has been out here 3 or 4 times, and there is NOTHING wrong with my washer. It is all this stupid Intelliflow unit. There is no flood but it just shuts off because it cannot work with the sophisticated electronics of the new Miele washer."
1,Electronics failed in just over a year of use,"I was impressed with this valve when I saw it on This Old House. I purchased one for my new laundry room and installed it about a year ago. I was surprised when the electronics failed. We were about to do a load of laundry and it was dead, no water. Luckily I do my own plumbing and easily switched back to a manual shutoff valve. Looking into a replacement, I now see several other reports of similar failures. Until this high failure rate is addressed by Watts, I have no intention of buying another, as much as I like the concept. I wish there was an alternative on the market."
1,DON'T BUY IT ! !,"I bought even after I read all the reviews. Man, I wish I had more common sense. Mine lasted exactly 8 months to the day, and broke within the one year warranty period. Watts doesn't honor the warranty cause I didn't buy it direct from them. What kind of load of junk is that. I bought this becuase I had seen it on TV on This Old House. Boy am I sorry. I have spent sometime on the phone trying to get it covered under warranty but now I give up. Don't buy any Watts products ! ! !"
2,Failed like many others,"Like other reviews, the product worked great for about 2 years then stopped. It doesn't seem to sense that there is a current draw from the washing machine and therefore it won't open up the solenoid valves to allow water in. I took it off so we could do the laundry. Not sure what I'm going to do next."
4,So far so good.,"I have had this unit for almost a year. I agree with the other reviewers, it seems a bit flimsy. It was not easy to install. You may want to hire a plumber if you can not solder. I also have a high efficiency unit so it took some tweaking to keep it from shutting off prematurely but I got it to work. I also had a problem with it hooked up to a GFI plug. I have an older house so I have both types of outlets in the laundry room. It kept tripping the GFI plug. I am not sure if that is the fault of the GFI or the IntelliFlow. Watts would really have something here if it redesigned the unit for DIY installation."
1,JUNK,"This think is JUNK do not install, I have 2 of them both of them broke in 4 years and then you cant just put a new shutoff in you need ot redo ALL your piping and then watts does not make a conversion kit to put on a ""standard"" easy shut off. This product should DYE its a scam and watts SHOULD stand behind it but they dont I called them as well worthless."
2,Don't use it with a newer High Efficiency front loader,"My new Kenmore front loader has two cycles that cause the IntelliFlow to time out (Heavy Duty and Whitest Whites). If the cycle lasts too long, the device thinks the water has remained open too long and closes the valve. The washer is trying to do the final rinse cycle, but cannot obtain water. Because the washer is electronic, there's no way to just turn everything off, unplug the Intelliflow, and restart at the same point in the wash cycle (once turned off the washer must resume from start). The Watts people's workarounds do not help either. I'm trying to decide whether to have the plumber remove it or just settle for dingy clothes."
1,Similar failure,Installed in our top-floor laundry area. Failed in a similar fashion to the other posts (trickle of cold water) after being used for 13 months - just after numerous loads of post-vacation laundry. Intelliflow needs to improve their reliability - go elsewhere until Watts does something to address this. Good idea - poor reliability.
3,"when it works it works, when it doesn't - BIG PROBLEMS","My IntelliFlow worked perfectly for 5 years but just conked out. Won't let hot water through. Cold water gets to the washer but no hot water. I removed the unit only to discover that the supplied fittings are not the standard 1/2"" or 3/4"" sizes for washer hookup! This is requiring me to call a plumber who has access to specialty supply houses (neither Depot nor Lowe's carry the fittings needed for me to hook up my washer, bypassing the Intelliflow!). Major pain in the xxx!"
1,Electronics FAIL - Buyer Beware!,"Similar to other reviews, my Watts IntelliFlow has gone to sleep for good after 2 years. It was plugged into a GFI that never tripped. The green power light won't come on so we'll have to disconnect it until we can install another product (FloodStop). We had shut the water off to the house to replace a broken exterior sill cock and when we went to use the washing machine the next day the power light was gone for good."
1,5 valves failed in 8 years,"I've had five Watts Intelliflow shut off valves in two houses since 2004. I've spent between $150-$200 per valve. The best one lasted 2.5 years. The worst one lasted 13 months. I like the idea, but have spent more on valves than I ever would for a flood insurance policy. I've unplumbed the Intelliflow and went back to two ball valves. Wish it was a better product."
2,Destined to fail,I had it for 13 months. Completely failed along the same lines that everyone else has experienced. Has a GFI unit and no power surge to cause it.Don't buy this product ...its a lot of money down the drain.
2,Alternative Found,With so many negitive reviews on this product I was not going to but. Doing a little research I found what I think is an alternative to this product. FloodStop has motorized ball valves with brass outlets. It does not with in conjunction with the washer as this product does. They also have similar products for hot water heaters.Control floods from broken washer hoses or leaks from washing machines . Only an automatic water sensor activated water shut off valve can save you from extensive water damage. The Floodstop is a single appliance automatic water shut-off system named by Readers Digest as one of the best 100 new products of 2004. The Flood Stop FS3/4H for washing machines has twin 3/4 inch hose threaded motorized ball valves with brass outlets.Hope this helps.
4,A much needed explanation for children with shunts,"This is the only book I've found that explains shunts in simple terms that children can understand. I am already reading this book to my two year old, and although some of the passages are a little too long to hold her attention, I know she's absorbing the information. I also can read this story to her cousins (who are 1, 5, and 8), to help them understand why my daughter has surgeries on her head. I would recommend this book for anyone who has a young child with hydrocephalus."
2,Too Small Carry Bag,This bag is too small for the Colemman ProCat Catalytic Heater.I was lead to believe it would accept all Coleman Heaters but this is not correct.A larger Carry Case Bag is needed for the ProCat Heater.
1,Too Small,"First: The picture shows a leather case. Wrong. Is just like a beach bag.Nothing special.Second: Really too small. The ProCat fit inside the caseonly with Vaseline (or a miracle).Conclusion: A big deception and never,never be bought together."
2,TOO BIG!,I just bought this case for the heater and wow it is TOO BIG! The little heater just gets put inside but there is nothing to keep it from banging into the base and the propane bottles. The case has two corner holders for propane bottles but nothing to hold the heater. Your heater and base may get damaged if you use it without some extra packing materials. I am using cardboard and bubble wrap to keep it all snug inside. This Heater needs a hard case. I hate sending things back so it will have to work. I guess it is better than not having a case. I camp all year round in my VW Pop Top.
3,Too small for Coleman ProCat Heater,"This bag was a recommended option when I was shopping for Coleman portable heaters. I bought it along with the larger ProCat heater, but the PROCAT heater DOES NOT FIT in this bag. It is probably intended for the smaller heaters, so I returned it. The ProCat heater itself is great."
2,Not for my heater,"This might be a good case for some Coleman heaters, but not for the Pro Cat series. I bought the case together with my Pro Cat as it was an Amazon recommendation for the Pro Cat. When the products arrived, I was very disappointed to discover that there was no way the Pro Cat would fit in the bag, which was much too small. While the bag may be ok (it's nicely padded and the workmanship appears reasonably good), it is useless for the recommended purpose of carrying the Pro Cat. I did not return it, thinking I could certainly find some other use for it; it's still in the closet. Amazon should NOT recommend this bag for the Pro Cat heater."
3,Missing Tracks,"There are two missing songs/music from the soundtrack. The opening credit theme (instrument) which I thought was great - but do not know the name of it. Secondly, David Gray's 'Sail Away'."
3,In defense of a fairly decent book . . .,"I wouldn't normally have reviewed ""Sister Wolf"", if I hadn't seen the only other review, which, while probably fairly correct, was a bit more cynical and harsh than I thought was deserved of the book. It's true that the plot is strange, and the characters a little distant and difficult to become attached to. However, the book was well done; Ann Arensburg is quite a good writer, and her prose is simple but sufficient. In the end, ""Sister Wolf"" seems to be nothing but a story about the difficult love of two people, and the attachment of one woman to her wild animals. However, ""Sister Wolf"" is saddening but fairly enjoyable, and is a fine light read. It's not a bestsellar, and it's not high on my list, but it's certainly not a novel deserving of the trashcan, and tossing it there without giving it a chance would certainly be a mistake."
3,Read the Last Chapter First,"Although I do not consider this book a wasted read, it is not topping my list of favorites.I found the storyline very difficult to follow, the characters were not at all engaging, and if the author used the word ""Sapphic"" one more time I was going to throw the book. However, the final chapter was a page-turner with a engaging plot, and a surprise ending. It also provided insight into the title of the work and salvaged the entire reading experience for me.My advice would be to skim everything but the last chapter. Read that one with relish.For anyone interested in a GOOD Ann Arensburg book, I suggest ""Incubus"", her best work by far."
2,It passed the time,"Not much to say about it. Its well-written but uninteresting. The affair between the teacher and the main character seemed force and also uninteresting. Altogether not something to seek out. I agree with another reviewer that if you are interested in Anne Arensberg, try ""Incubus"", just as well-written but more interesting."
2,Strike out,"Tried this once in my early twenties. Again in my late thirties. When the Guardian ran its book club last year with the Quartet, I thought I'd give it one more try. Nope. It's as florid now as it was thirty years ago. I kept swinging at the purple prose til I struck out."
3,"Starts strong, but then...","Having read Durrell's Bitter Lemons, I was well aware of his skills as a writer and was initially enthralled by the prose, which at times is lyrical -- you can almost swim in it. And so it went for about the first hundred pages or so. But at some point the action and the characters, and their motivations, grew mysterious and vague, and ultimately tiresome. I didn't care what happened to these people. Perhaps it is a book that requires the reader to have loved fully, and often, to appreciate. But for me, after a while, the meditations on love became remote. I would certainly give this book a chance -- indeed, I think it's essential reading. Don't be too ashamed to admit, however, that after 175 pages you just don't care to go further."
2,Overrated,"Durrell is often celebrated for the beauty of his prose. But compared to, say, Virginia Woolf or Proust, Durrell's writing often seems strained and self consciously arty. Many beautiful metaphors and, to me, just as many that fall flat and say nothing. Add to that characters who seem more like vehicles for ideas and actions rather than actual human beings (as V.S. Pritchett noted). Skip it and try Swann's Way or Mrs. Dalloway instead."
2,I got through it,"I wanted to like this book, but it was rough going. I kept waiting for a story to kick in but I couldn't stick with it enough and would leave it for a few weeks. That didn't help.What kept me going was the hope of running into a passage like this: ""Loving is so much truer when sympathy and not desire makes the match; for it leaves no wounds."" I liked observations like that but I just couldn't get into the story.To be more honest, I couldn't find the story."
2,Daggett & Ramsdell Fade Solustions Skin Lightening Kit Didn't Work For Me,"These products did not work well on my skin. My skin is too sensitive for them. That dosen't necessarily mean it won't work for someone else. I'm a woman of color, and I've found, Ambi Skin Discoloration Fade Cream for Normal Skin to works best for me."
4,A New View Towards Education,"This book illustrates a very plausible way of turning around American education. The thoughts that are illustrated in this book are both thought provoking and encouraging to try. The fact that all students should be held to the same high standards is a fact that I, as an educator, believe to be of utmost importance in giving students the will and encouragement needed to succeed in our changing world. The days of tracking are over (or should be) and this book delivers us a way of improving education for ALL kids."
5,Kids love these rare and catchy songs,We bought this for the Teletubbies theme song when the girls were very young. They are now 7 and 5 and this CD is still in heavy rotation. The songs are catchy and upbeat and most are recognizable theme show songs. I always try to by kids music that grownups can stand and this one is so catchy I sometimes even found myself humming along to this one.
1,Junk,"I didn't even grind an ounce of fresh cut pork before the thing blew up.This junk needs to stay in China.I had to give this a rating,but it doesn't deserve one."
3,Megpro Electric Meat Grinder,"I purchased this grinder from Amazon as a refurbished item. When received, it looked new. It works a whole lot better when you put it together right! I was so frustrated with this grinder---it just wasn't performing the way I thought it should. UNTILL I checked the instruction manual and discovered I had put it together backward. After I fixed it it worked perfectly and I had fresh ground beef burgers for lunch."
3,"OK, but",Only thing this can do that a food processer cannot is make sausage links. I seldom use it. Grinding up beef or pork the food processer works better.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!,"This coffee maker is a cheaply built rip-off. My pause-and-serve apparatus broke off after less than 5 uses. The plastic lid for the espresso pot broke off, leaving a chunk of plastic in my espresso. The stainless steel is actually silver plastic. The overall feel is cheap and flimsy. I've seen the reviews of this product on other sites and the consensus is that it is a mistake to purchase this item."
4,Great,"This is the unit for you if you enjoy espresso. We usually use it for regular coffee only though. The milk frother never seemed to work as well as expected, just made the milk bubble, but not fluffy."
3,Okay.,"Story was okay. Drug on a little.. I can understand the Christian aspect of the book, which I appreciate, but it got a little monotonous."
2,River Between,"The book had a very slow start and I couldn't get past the first 50 pages.Since it was so slwo to start, I couldn't invest the time in making me keep reading especially when there are there other books in the series. Had I completed this book, I would have felt the obligation to readthe other books in the series and I think it would have been a struggle with those as well."
3,The River Between (Book One of the River Series),I would loved to have known I was unable to purchase book two of this series for my Kindle all I can find are other books in the series. I enjoyed the one I read and was looking forward to book two when I read the epilogue of this book but then can't find it on Kindle a little bit disappointed Or am I doing something wrong I did try under Magnolia which it said the series was re written under?
3,Good basics video...,"This DVD is a very basic video, catering more to an absolute beginner. Could have been a little more organized/professional. Some things were done out of order, which may confuse those who are sticklers for learning procedures step by step. It is a decent basics video. I don't know if i agree with some of the techniques or tools used but again it is a very basic intro to spa treatments."
2,"Informative, but wordy.","This book has a good amount of information in it, and as such has to be fairly wordy. I, however, found it to be wordy to the degree the author sounds arrogant, trying to impress the reader with his vocabulary (when simpler words would have done just as well and made the book more enjoyable to read.) It is the kind of book one reads for seminary, not for pleasure."
3,Comfortable Flipflop,"I owned this sandal years ago and wore it completely out. I just had to have it again. This time I ordered a mens instead of womens. It's still very comfortable, but the straps fit differently on my foot; not as high on the top on my foot. Still the perfect flipflop!"
5,Flip Flops,My son was thrilled that I found these. It isn't always easy to find larger sizes. Puma is his favorite brand and flip flops are his favorite summer shoe.
3,Only slightly disappointing,I wanted to be sure I had all of Russell Watson's CD's and DVD's but was prepared thatI might not like this one as much as his others. All the same I am fascinated by his voice and background and his personality to I am still pleased I bought it.
3,Disappointed!,I am a huge Russell Watson fan...but I really prefer him singing more classical music. This is my least favorite of his CD's . He does a good job...but not good enough on this one.
3,"if you like these songs, you'll love the CD. if you like RW, it depends","I enjoy Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. I thoroughly enjoy Russell Watson's ""Encore"" and ""Amore Musica.""Do I like this CD? Well, the songs I already liked, RW did a good job with. Songs I didn't know or like before are just so-so."
3,not very durable,"we bought this as a second player controller. The original playstation controller is much more durable than this imitation controller. It did not last very long before the wire started to break off of the controller. Compared to the original Sony controller, it is not very good."
1,PS2 Controllers,I ordered Micrcon Dual Force 2 controllers for the playstation 2 system. Items sent were just standard Mad Catz controllers for the system and were not dual shock 2's and wrong color. Controllers received were blue not black though receipt with controllers states black. Not a real complaint since they work and were cheap but seller should send what they describe they are selling.
5,People in Space,Wonderful write up of Mormon theology that is not often heard of. The book explains some of the little known theology of the Mormon church. A great book for anyone considering becoming a member.
4,ez,My granddaughter immediatily grabbed the drum and started playing away with a big smile on her face danced around the room. What more could you ask of a toy?
2,Loved it right until it broke!,"We got this for our 2 year old son for Christmas. He loved is, both as an instrument set and as a method of carrying other toys around. A few days ago, 6 months after we bought it, he was doing his usual drumming & singing routine and the drum stick went right through the head. He was so upset, and I'm frustrated. I bought this set because it was supposed to be durable! He's an almost-3 year old, not a 10 year old, he shouldn't be able to break the drum by using it correctly!"
1,Cheaper Else where on Amazon!,This toy is sold elsewhere on Amazon under the name B. Parum Pum Pum Drum for $20. Save your money.
1,"Too expensive at this site, buy it at Target",Amazon is selling this WAY OVER PRICE. It sells for about $19.99 at Target. Otherwise it is a great musical gift for babys and toddlers.
2,Fun but safety concern,My 15 month old daughter loves this set but walks around with the drum sticks in her mouth. It makes me shudder to think if she fell with the long drum stick in her mouth. I'm surprised they put such long sturdy sticks in the kit for a one year old. I have taken them out of the set and will give them back when she's older.
1,"Dull, unmusical thud",The sound this drum makes is less like the sound of a drum than an empty box. My grandson didn't like it. He took the sticks and found something more musical to beat on.
2,Another Guy Trying to be a Latin Superstar,"Richard lugo, yes to girls is cute, but will him being cute really sell records?... I think not. The first single off the album ""Boom"" is a song that you would hear on little kid stations because of the word Boom used every five seconds and the un-origianl beat that is used every 5 seconds. The other songs on this album such as ""All The Girl I Need"", ""Ven Ven Ven"" are written very badly, and show no effort by Lugo singigng them. Let me get to the point .. Lugo has no voice .. It's all computer, the only thing orignal on this cd is Lugos name. The ballads on this album, sounds like a cat that just got it's tail stepted on. If you want a god album get Britney Spears ""Oops!..I Did It Again"", or past Mariah Carey albums .. now those are CD's you an handle listeing to. P.S - Beth, you can have this cd .. just don't give it back!"
4,Really good CD,"I know some ppl on here think that Richie has no future in singing & maybe you're right. But, then there's a good chance you're wrong. I think he has great potential. His ballads are great & he does have a really good voice. No, he's not quite as polished as Ricky Martin or Enrique Iglesias....yet. I mean, they're in their 20's, Richie is 15! It's his first album. He's new to the business & I think he's doing something that takes a lotta guts. I can't imagine that it would be easy to throw yourself out into the public when you're 15 & hearing the critical things ppl would say about your music. Anyway, I think Richie puts his heart & soul into his music & he's doing a great job. He's not the big superstar yet, but trust me....this boy is gonna blow up!Ps: It doesn't hurt that he is too cute either!"
5,The greates books for your children,to enjoy and learn Spanish fast!Wonderful and short jokes the kids love and can understand easily ...and coloring drawings..You won't regret it and the children will be laughing their heads off !!Mine do
4,Good audio cassette.,I didn't think I would like it but I was wrong because I really liked this audio cassette recording of Nan Ryan's Cloudcastle and I liked the characters Natalie Vallance and Kane Covington. It's an abridged audio cassette but I thought it was fine and didn't mind the condensed story!

4,Very good industrial style rock..,"Godhead can kind of be described as a Manson/Orgy hybrid with their own distinct touch. This 11 song album is very strong and its strongest with ""the reckoning"" ""eleanor rigby"" and ""break you down"" (with guest vocals by Manson himself), the album from start to finish is very strong. Godhead can only become better from here.."
4,Its a pretty good album,"I'd have to say i enjoyed this album, because im an Orgy fan and a Manson fan. This would have to fit as a gothic version of Orgy meets Nine Inch Nails. So that's what they sound like. They have really strong bass and guitar. And the drummer knows how to stir up things. The singers voice never gets hard though, but you can handle without, right. The standout tracks are: Backstander, I Sell Society, The Reckoning, Break you Down (Marilyn Manson).Overall, a pretty good album. ... ."
2,Mediocre at best,"When I first heard ""Power Tool Stigmata"" I instantly fell in love with this band. So naturally I couldnt wait to hear this one. My first problem is with ""Eleanor Rigby,""its a great song, but it was on the last CD, My next problem is ""Penetrate,"" Also on the last CD, and not even one of the better ones from that album. Also there isnt really a good flow to the CD. The good songs are great, like ""I hate today,"" ""The Reckoning,"" and ""I Sell Society."" But they don't make up for the rest. This album is definitely for die-hard fans. For their next album I think I'll have to check it out before I buy. ..."
2,its ok,did anybody else notice who shares writing credits on i sell society?s.puetsky aka daisy berkowitz (formermarilyn manson guitarist)i just thought it was weird that marilyn and daisy would be on the same album considering they cant stand each otherthis cd is ok..mediocre.it has a couple of good songs.......thats all
1,"50 Minutes of untalented, uninspired filth","*Sigh*. I had high expectations for this CD, but it didnt even come close to falling short. I listened to this cd once, and it bored me to sleep. The music is incredibly slow and almost painfull to listen to, and demonstrates little to none skill or intensity. The vocals, however, are just an absolute failure. Theres no other way to put it. The lyrics have no meaning, he repeats himself over and over, and again show NO talent whatsoever. These guys clearly tried to rip off Manson, but managed to fail horribly. And anyway, even had they done a halfway decent job, do we really need another pop goth band to clog our minds with worthless garbage? If you suffer from insomnia, then save yourself the doctor bills and buy this cd... itll put you out in no more than 50 minutes. Pathetic attempt at a CD... you would be better off wiping your *ss with your money than buying this... unless you need a cd to sit on your shelf and collect dust."
5,Versatile game with art-quality graphics,"We've enjoyed playing this game individually or on our home network of 3 computers. When networked, we can help each other out by paying ""tribute"" or selling a ship full of supplies for $0 and selling it back again. The graphics are different from many games in that they have the appearance of a textured oil painting. For me, this adds to the beauty of the game. The game is versitile in allowing either a peaceful settlement or conquest and offers the option of designing detailed scenarios. The variables seem endless and my teenage sons and I haven't gotten bored yet!"
3,It is a different colony simulation,"I find this game to be interesting. The game can be slow when you have no pirates or wars breaking out. It has good graphics. If you are looking for a long running scenario game without the slash/gore that many pc games have today, this one can be entertaining."
5,GREAT GAME,I'm giving this game such a good rating because I have played 1503 A.D. This game is sooo much better. My favorite thing in the game was the map and mission creator. Don't buy 1503 A.D but buy 1602 A.D.
3,3/5,"There seem to be two options. One is to start building at least one colony from scratch in an archapelago. This would be good if you're willing to play for weeks or months at a time, but it's awfully slow going. Or, you can come in at one of a number of situations. In that case you are, to varying degrees, established, but extremely difficult goals are set, and huge fleets of pirates prowl the seas in most scenarios."
4,General consensus proves to be true yet again *sigh*,"I bought this game because of the recommendation provided by John Harrison, the reviewer who wrote in on March 13, 2000. While it has proven to be fun, there are a few drawbacks to this game. Chief among them is that after a few hours of play, I find my colony running out of money frequently & cannot figure out how to resolve the situation. Secondly, the manual is way too vague on how to increase the workload and production levels of workshops which lag behind (that's what the ""question-mark"" symbol means). If the programmers at Infogrames could resolve these two issues in the next edition (or a sequel, perhaps?) they would have a sure winner on their hands! As it stands now, though, these two difficulties make an otherwise great game unnecessarily complex."
3,Average game,"I don't know how many of you have played Colonization, but it's almost like an advanced version of that game. While the idea of the game is exciting, game play is very difficult. The AI competition is too hard to handle while you're trying to deal with the complex stucture of running your colony. It's just an average game. I wouldn't consider bad or good, but I havn't played for a while now (if that says anything)."
2,Good idea gone bad,At first play a thought this game was for me. But a short time playing I relieved I was wrong.Being a fan of sim/build/war games and expecting that from 1602AD I was very disappointed. The game does incorporate building and war but room for expansion is limited (all you have to build on is small islands). Game play was difficult due to poor feed back during game play (being attacked and not even made aware).I purchased this game because people who brought The Sims also brought 1602AD.If you want a good game of building/war/sim I would recommend any of the Ages of Empires or Civilizations. Both good games.Please don't waste your time or money on 1602AD.
2,m m,wene i purchased this game it took me a while to figure it out but when i did and mastered it it wasnt any fun although i may not have purchased ceasar 3 or civilization i have purchased two of the age of empires games .The game is just boring after youve beaten it once or twice and it gets worse after a while i figured out how to build an empire i tried the scenerio builder and it was fun somewhat but not my kind of game so if you like batles and blood this is not the game for you please save your money.
4,1602 ad personal views,"This game combines unique trading techniques with the usual gathering of resources and building a thriving empire. The neat part of this game is the fact that it is an easy going game. Players can focus mainly on expanding their colony and trade, which I think are the most fun parts of the game. Much later in the game players can attack a neighboring colony if necessary. Other players will be forced to expand their colony as well. This is a nice change, as most strategy games are focused solely on destroying the opponent from the get go. There are many more things this game has to offer including multiplayer (up to 4 players). I look forward to trying this feature, if I can find some other players out there. I would recommend this as a good purchase. The single player scenarios will provide players with hours of fun and practice, then players can try their hand at the multiplayer side where the possibilities are almost endless!"
5,"really fun, intriguing","When i got this game off the internet one day i was stunned by how addictive it was. I was drawn in by its really fun city building and colonizing aspects. I have played civilization, command and conquer, and starcraft and this is comparible to all those. In the beginnig you start out with a ship and colonize an island. THen you must become self-sufficient and supply materials for your settlers. You have to get wood, food, and all sorts of other demands. I think the two best things about this game are 1:You dont have to fight all the time and that is only an aspect of the game 2:There is a way to get materials rather than making them yourself. THat is trading. This game has an extensive trading aspect that is not too hard to manage.I hope even after reading reviews that degraded this game you still want to buy it, because you should."
3,"Not the best, but captures the Pogues energy live","Okay, so its not the best recording ever, kind of like a really good bootleg, but it does capture the live energy of a Pogues show. So what if you can't make out what Shane is saying?? You never can. But you cannot deny his lyrical genius, or the Pogues musicianship. Captured here are some of the Pogues best. Sayonara blares from the speakers, sounding as if there are a lot more musicians than are really in the band. The Pogues sound is full. If you are worried about the sound quality, then you are really left buying a bootleg (Live on Rain Street, etc.), unless you opt for Shane with the Popes and get Across the Broad Atlantic. If you are a devoted fan, get this. If you are trying to get your first feel for the band, get a studio album, preferably If I Should Fall From Grace with God."
3,not as bad as others will lead you to think,"i guess this falls into the same category as the Clash's ""Cut The Crap"" album. One person says its bad so others will think the same. this is not a bad quality live recording (trust me, you can do worst), but it's not the best. i must admit it has good stuff on it (especially rain street). but then again shane sounds drunk... its not a bad recording, just keep that in mind, but you will probably want to wait for the re-union album."
1,Horrible Recording,This is a horrible CD. It was actually released without the permission of The Pogues and they (The Pogues) ask you to please not purchase it.
1,"great band, not-so-great copy","this has a great selection of stuff, but the quality is weak. buy the studio albums for now, most notably, peace and love and if i should fall...."
3,"It's okay, not the greatest!","I mainly bought it for the cover of Hanson's ""Thinking Of You"", and I was kind of shocked at the sound. It's very true to it's genre, I think. So if you're a fan of the genre of music, then you'll enjoy this album. Although, I'm not liking what they did with ""Thinking Of You""."
4,A fun book,"Barker may have missed the title of this book when he/she wrote their review.10-Minute Feng Shui delivers what it promises. It is a quicky, easy, fun introduction to the concept of Feng Shui.Feng Shui is actually a very complicated art, if you want to skip the measurements, coordinates and finding the ying and yang of your home - this may be for you.The book offers quick tips like (taken off the back cover)*Put a vase of yellow flowers in your kitchen to increase your wealth*Tie nine small bells on a red chord and hang it from your front door to bring happiness into your homeIt also has a section which demystifies colors, numbers, shapes, elements and cures - simply and effectively.No, this book isn't going to make you an interior decorator, but it is a fun gift for yourself or another."
4,Must-Have for Die-Hards...,"...but not for general consumption. This collection has nearly every video that MO has made up to Tubular Bells II (let's hope Warner brings out a DVD to complete the set) and quite a few surprises. I could go on about the videos but I will say that most are unwatchable by today's standards, though Five Miles Out, within its 1982 context, was arguably the best video MO ever made. The videos appear to be homages to Monty Python, or MO trying too hard (his attempts at CG are just as silly). But fans will love it, regardless. Surprises include the very rare Don Alfonso even internet-savvy fans didn't know existed; a 17 minute segment from The Space Movie with music from Incantations Parts 3&4 (but none of the unreleased music!); and a complete Tubular Bells Part 1 live on BBC (which was cut off on the orginal Elements VHS)."
1,Cheap for a reason,"The moment I opened the box and held one of these knives I thought they were flimsy but I shrugged it off and didn't think much of it, 2 days later the first steak knife broke by a week after we got this set we had lost two more. It's only a matter of time before they all break so do yourself a favor spend a little more on a set that will last longer then a month."
1,TERRIBLE!,These knives are a joke! They are so bad in quality you are unable to cut anything! It actually becomes very dangerous to use them because the blade is soooo thin it flops all over when you're cutting. The first (and last) time I used one was cutting cabbage and the knife kept sliding off the cabbage because it wasn't strong enough to cut through. Very dangerous! Do NOT waste your money!!
4,bang for buck,"this is a good bargain knife set, not very durable but who cares you will use it for a few years."
2,you get what yo pay for.,"Only paid $4 for these knives, so I didn't expect much. I was right, it seems like I break at least 1 per week. Not really using them roughly, but the handles are light cheap plastic that just snaps off. For the price they aren't bad, I just recommend spending the extra money on well-made ones."
2,Disappointed,I have a set of these very knives and have been quite happy with them. I was elated to find more available for purchase. Problem #1 - Box says 6 steak knives and I rec'd 5. Problem #2 - Used one tonight to cut my piece of pizza and it broke apart in my hand! Not a happy camper! :(
1,you get what you pay for,"Well, I saw this incredible deal and I couldn't resist. My wife was wanting another knife set and I thought, what can I lose? I got J U S T what I paid for. They're sharp and all, but I'm afraid they're gonna break in half everytime I use them. Not very sturdy at all....Oh well, can always use them for camping..? Oh yeah, I hate goin camping....Huh....."
2,"I guess, you get what you pay for.","I bought them because they were cheap! And yup, the quality was too. I couldn't use the knife properly. It is so thin and flexible. If you try using them, it sways the other way. As I said, you get what you paid for. This many knives (good ones) for such a price is seriously unbelievable."
2,Good Features - Terrible Battery Life,The battery life is so poor (<20 min) that nothing else need be known about this phone. Avoid it.
1,Doesn't Hold Charge,"Had my phone for about a year now and it never has held a charge for more than 20 minutes of talk time. From day one I charged the phone over night for about 15 hours and found the unit would display ""Recharge"" after about 15 to 20 minutes of use. After a couple of months I purchased a new battery and the problem was not fixed. Now a friend of mine with the same phone is having the exact same problem after only 2 months. There is definetly a problem with the design of this phone. AVOID THIS PHONE !!!"
1,Panasonic bummer,"Great features yes, but I have had (and am still having) the same battery problems as other reviewers: the phone regularly needs 12 hours of charging to provide about 2 hours maximum talk time - and it only has about 12 hours standby time at most even when it's ""fully charged."" To make matters worse, the handset produces endless snap, crackle and pop on almost every channel. Very disappointing. Have had two other Panasonic cordless phones -- one of them was excellent and that's why I've kept buying the brand. This phone may have cured me of the Panasonic habit."
1,This many people can't be wrong!,"I hate to add to the whining...but it's true. This phone has some very nice features, combined with what I think is a defective charging circuit inherent in the design. I had my phone ""repaired"" by Panasonic once. The battery difficulties returned. I have spent half what I paid for the phone on new battery packs. I have even used external equipment to measure and charge the packs. To no avail! As soon as you rely on the phone to maintain the battery's charge, the batteries fail. I'm surprised that Panasonic keeps feeding this dog to the marketplace. Let's hope these reviews alert people to avoid this product."
2,where's the battery life they promised?,"I bought this phone in September 2002 the exchanged because I thought I had a lemon. The second was just as bad. The battery just doesn't last. I had to leave it charging when not in use or it world start to beep after a few hours of use. Other then that I like it. I almost forgot I called the company and they sent me some paded stickers to stick on the battery to ""help extend the battery life."""
1,"Good Features, Poor Quality","After shopping around for a good quality home/office phone, I decided on this one which ended up being very disappointing. The phone has some good features but very poor quality. I had instant issues with battery having to be charged constantly. I took that one back to the store. Now I am in the midst of doing a replacement since people have trouble hearing me, I cut in and out, people on the other end sound muffled. I didnt expect that from a [$] phone. Wouldnt waste the money on this one!"
3,An easy read - maybe too easy?,"I found more than one ""over simplification"" where the book doesn't stick a 100% to the specification, for instance when it comes to throwing the right kinds of exceptions when using BMP.I find ""Enterprise JavaBeans (3rd Edition)"" by Richard Monson-Haefel to be more precise, more complete and better structured."
2,Good book but not for starters!,"This book states on the back cover: ""All you need to know to get started with this book is Java"". What does this mean? My first guess was OK, I have done some Java programming in the past so this book will get me going in EJBs. How far from the truth this was. I would sugest anyone to get a gentler introduction (book) if they want to understand this book. The two tutorials at the back on RMI-IIOP & JNDI are not tutorials, they are summary notes on advanced topic(s)."
3,Comprehensive Book with a Strong Practical Edge,"If you are a beginner and want to get quickly working code this book seems to be a good choice. It is eminently practical, well structured (nearly) and quite complete.But don't fool yourself for the deeper topics you have to look somewhere else. Also it always makes me sad to see a book that will probably only be good for less than a couple of years."
5,"Like a psychedelic frying pan, whacking you repeatedly","To continue the kitchen metaphor: Put Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Blue Cheer, Spacemen 3 and Jimi Hendrix in an 10000 megawatt blender for several decades, serve like molten lava. Will induce euphoria."
4,more rockin psychedelia from DC's finest,"A more rustic album than the last. This one is slower and more noisy. Not quite the tour-de-force of heavy phychedelic rock than the first album was. Still, worth every penny for guitar fans. Im still amazed at the quality of the recording. Its perfect."
4,Long Tailed Shirt,"I bought two of these to sleep in because an old one of mine finally wore out. It was an XL regular and since I am 6'5"", I bought XL tall. The shirt if very long. I wear it more for regular use and will buy two more that are XL regular. I do like the softness of these shirts."
5,The best from Rush Limbaugh's TV series,"In this Video Rush Limbaugh hosts a series of clips from his television series. He plays videos of liberals making fools of themselves, congressmen putting people to sleep, and some of the funnier moments from his TV series.Firstly, any ditto head is going to love this tape and most conservatives are going to enjoy this tape as well. However, most liberals are going to be hard pressed to get anything out of this. Limbaugh is confrontational, and seeing liberal icons make fools of themselves isn't going to switch anyone's political attitudes. However, I'm not a liberal, so I'm going to recommend buying this volume, it's hilarious.Also added at the end of the ""deluxe"" edition is ""Rush Limbaugh's American Dream"" which is a heartfelt half hour, but is a little drawn out.This is a video you can watch over and over, and it never really gets old."
2,Don't Do IT!!!!!!,"I absolutely love Rush Limbaugh. But I gotta come clean here. This video totally blows. It's just a lame attempt to make money by recycling bits and pieces of video that were probably funny back in the day, but taken out of context, leave most of their humor behind.Having said that, I simply MUST respond to a recent reviewer who said ""I think this book is only funny to those who consume mass quanities (sic) of oxycontin"" and ""...I think he might have been high while writing this book and I wasn't while reading it."" Ummm.....Hello? You READ a VHS tape? You didn't bother to watch it before reviewing it? Probably the most confusing ""book"" in the world....can't seem to get the pages open. I guess Rush was right. Sometimes you really do just gotta laugh."
1,Sometimes....You DON'T,i think this book is only funny to those who consume mass quanities of oxycontin. he is only funny to look at. i like rush...don't get me wrong.it is just that i think he might have been high while writing this book and i wasn't while reading it.that can present a problem.i am glad he is better now. it would be sad to see him pull it together and then have to go to prison.jack e. jettthe jack e. jett show
5,Trailer for Jingles the Clown,Length:: 1:33 MinsI thought you might like to see the trailer for Jingles the Clown . . .Jingles the Clown
3,HP CD-R,The HP CD-R that I got worked great. Very few problems recording and I have an almost full music CD on it. The only problem is that it left out ten seconds of music at the end of one of my songs.
3,HP CD-Rs are UGLY!,"Hewlett Packard CD-R's are okay, I have a couple of them and they work great. However, I don't recommend these CD-R's because they are so ugly. Pretty much, CD-R's are the same, I have preferences based on looks. I recommend getting Memorex 80 minute CD-R's because they are bigger and the look cool. Ricoh Platinum is what I use for storing data. Memorex 80 is what I use for music."
5,Great Anime,"I LOVED this Anime!!!Good mix of Drama and funniness.I Wished there was more between Ellis and Nadie tho, They are such a good couple <3<3<3I have the Vol.s, Vol 1 and Vol 2 Box Sets."
1,Don't Bother,"Save your money, this guy is a crook. If you do enough research on his name, you will find he robbed multiple people of thousands of dollars. He had a mentoring program that he charged $30,000 for. He didn't deliver on his mentoring and he disappeared after getting everybody's money. This guy belongs on American Greed. You can easily find more credible mentors to learn from. You can't say you wasn't warned...."
4,Review for Guide To Literary Agents,"I found that the information in this book really helped and guided me search for an agent. The book was user friendly by showing which agents were accepting new writers, what types of books they were interested in and by having a good and bad copy of query letters and synopsis'. This helped with my writing a correct query letter and I was able to avoid sending scripts to agents that would not be interested in my type of story. Very informative and I highly recommend it, especially for a new author,"
4,"Literary Agents, good info","This guide is very helpful in sorting through the hundreds of agents that are available. The book breaks down steps on how to contact agents, and what to be aware of. The cross section in the back is very helpful in finding the agents that are interested in what you plan to write."
3,Cute for light reading,I bought this for my husband an avid traveler and lover of American Airlines. He says he was a little disappointed as it is less of a story and more like little anecdotes. He also states the publisher may have been asleep when he was editing but it IS written well and the notes are interesting.
1,UMM It said pack of ten bandages for 7.49 I think....I got ONE!,"I think......I HOPE more are on the way, said pack of TEN and I got ONE 15' bandage for over seven dollars, I could have gone to ANY local store and got MANY for seven bucks, PLEASE tell me I'm just on a back order list, Am I being punked? Wheres the camera...lol."
3,Not bad,"We sadly lost this great singer and song writer two days ago at the age of 75. This CD of re recordings isn't too bad, but his original versions of Oh Lonesome Me, Blue Blue Day, Sea Of Heartbreak and others are a lot better. I especially like his remake of I Can't Stop Loving You which is on this CD, but his original version from 1958 is beautiful. Highly recommended."
2,Boring Bootcamp,"This seems like it is probably a good workout as far as toning and strengthening your core. But, I found it very boring, which I might have been able to forgive, except that he is constantly lying about how many more reps there are! I am not especially lazy, but nor do I really enjoy working out - when he says ""two more,"" and after two more, he says, ""four more,"" I become irate.If all you care about in life is having great abs, this is probably a fine way to get them. But, if you are looking to work out and not pass out from boredom, look elsewhere."
4,One Time Tae Bo Fan,"I don't usually like Tae Bo videos. But I wanted an abs specific video with at least the hope of cardio benefit. This video is short (30 minutes) and most exercises are standing (a nice change). Done in front of a mirror you can SEE your abs and check your position - which can be dangerous or reduce efficacy in supine abdominal work. The ""connecting move"" gets tedious, but I usually substitute a different abdominal tightening move until he gets to the next exercise. I like this video...one of the few that appears in my rotation more than once."
5,TERRIFIC!,"As a Tae Bo novice, I find this video to be outstanding. The moves are not complicated like on other videos; they are also varied, effective and specific to your abs. Plus, Billy Blanks is absolutely wonderful...he is encouraging, motivating, and not at all intimidating. Terrific video, outstanding workout!"
5,Fast Fun Effective,"This is a great workout that combines strength training and cardio for maximum fat burning that continues long after you've finished. In 30 minutes Billy will make you feel the deepest fibers of your transverse abdominal muscles- ALL OF THEM!I like using the resistance bands for his other workouts that require them, but not this one b/c they cut in to my arms so bad they leave bruises. I solved that problem by just doing the workout with a set of light hand weights. Trust me, stick with it and you will see results:)"
3,Be ready,"This is a good video, I purchased it to help me out after my first child. Don't know if this was the best right after a c-section, but it really hits the ab muscles hard."
1,Unsatisfied,"I purchased this item used for a very good price however, the item showed 2-3 day shipping which it took more than 3 weeks to get delivered. When the item finally arrived I tried to play it on a regular dvd player, PS2 and PS3. The dvd would not play on either device. Finally after multiple attempts there was an error that showed up on the screen that said the dvd could not be read and was not compatible. The format of the dvd was an unknown format, also the back of the dvd was written in spanish not english which the description selected was english. I was very upset about this because I got this dvd to help me lose weight along with a diet plan for my upcoming wedding. I shopped online because the price was right and it was convenient with shipping, but I do not intend on discussing again. I've purchased itmes on amazon before but never used, and I don't think I will go used again."
4,Just fine.,I am new to Tae Bo (this being my second DVD by Billy Blanks). I think it's fun to do because you get a sweat fast and Billy is so good looking it makes it easier to focus. Some of the moves I don't think will do anything for you at all though. I do pilates a lot so I would know when I'm working my abs.I can certainly tell a difference in my abs the morning after every session. It feels tighter.The backround on the video is also motivating in a way it has an american flag with nice lighting. I also find motivation from the outfits the people are wearing. Most of them are wearing camo print.The only reason I didn't give this thing 5 stars is because1: I think some of the moves are useless2: It's intimidating because you aren't with an instructor and you don't get much detail on how to do the move perfectly.
3,Average,Billy Blank's: Ab Bootcamp is nothing special. The workout was not intense. This workout would be a great warm-up to a more intense workout.
3,Supposed History,"I believe it is fair to let everyone know a little more frankly that this is just a supposed history of a great Alchemist. It is very much about reincarnation and spirit guides so if you are not interested in these things, move on. It also does not give any real history of Saint Germain himself and is for the most part a Brotherhood of Light beginners guide. If you are a practicing physical Alchemist, like myself, this book will do nothing for you.On that note, if you are just being introduced to the special organizations of the ""New Age"" this book is alright. You must, however, either take it as instruction or information. I suggest real Alchemists to look elsewhere."
3,For Insiders Only,"Like much psychic writing, you have to already believe in re-incarnation to want this book. For the skeptics among us, there are assertions that the author makes that are difficult to swallow whole. I'll admit to being a novice when it comes to reading ""channeled wisdom."" The concept of multiple manifestations in several historical persons, while fascinating, is a real rational stretch. There are stories that ""are true even if they never happened."" I believe this is a bit of fiction that is not without its value in asserting understanding what makes for holiestic human living, but the story itself is at very least an unprovable and unlikely but containing subconscious collective wisdom."
1,No product received.,"I have not received any product, item was lost in transit and there is no window for reclaims. This is very bad, this not totally the vendors fall but to contact the shipper is very hard and no information is available."
1,No MP3 Album???,I love how Amazon does not sell MP3 albums for the greatest hit albums. I guess this would reduce the need to purchase individual non-greatest hit albums separately. Annoying!!!!!!
3,Is this the Best?,"LISTENING TO NEW ORDER SINCE IT WAS JOY DIVISION, MAKES ME THINK IF IT'S FAIR TO PUT THE BEST OF THEM IN A 16 SONG COMPILATION. FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW NEW ORDER AND WANT TO LISTEN TO THE BEST (AND HAVE THE MONEY OF COURSE), BUY ALL OF THE ALBUMS MY FRIENDS, OR IF YOU JUST WANT TO GET STARTED CHECK OUT 1987'S SUBSTANCE ALBUM. WITH GROUPS LIKE THESE THERE'S ALWAYS A GREAT SONG LEFT OUT IN COMPILATIONS."
3,Always One Song Omitted,"Have New Order and Joy Divisions ""Substance"" CDs. This one is okay. It does contain ""World in Motion"". BUT, as usual, this compilation does NOT contain one of New Order's most stark and stunningly lovely songs - ""Your Silent Face"". Of course, if you want that, you have to purchase ""Power Corruption and Lies"" to get it. This CD is useable, but hardly the definative ""Best Of""."
4,One of my favorites,"All right, let me get this straight... Have you ever heard the song True Faith or Bizzare Love Triangle? Those I think, were two of their greatest and two of my favorites. I had always liked the heavy synth and the strange monotone vocal of New Order. How many bands have music as different as that? Another favorite was Shell Shock, it's somewhat different from their usual songs, but I thought it was cool. It's a really neat album, different songs, a very different synth style, and also this is the first band I've heard that uses monotone vocals. Is it recommended? Yeah, definitely, but there are a few things I didn't like about my version which was the 94 version. Although I like True Faith on that one, I didn't like Bizzare Love Triangle, one of my most favorite songs as the version was too short and I liked the original synth used. But still, buy this one nonetheless and enjoy the music of it."
2,the rest of..,"this album doesn't even remotely do this band justice. The renditions of the songs they have selected are often weaker(i.e perfect kiss,blue monday,bizarre love triangle), because these are the radio versions, but no one is a buying the cd because they want the radio dammit, they want the best of new order. bottom line: great band, but this disc is waste of time. check out substance instead and wait patiently until someone actually compiles a real best of collection. Also note this album completely neglect power corruption, and lies, my favourite new order album and the turning point in their career."
3,"good songs, bad mixes","In name, this CD has all the big hits of New Orders 80s-90s heyday. All the melodies are there, but the CD itself quickly fell out of rotation. I think the big problem is that the picked some very dry mixes of the popular songs in order to retain space for more of the 'moderately popular' songs. The end result is a lot of music that starts to pique the ears, but remains unsatisfying. I would have much rather seen them pick some better mixes of the songs - preferably using the 12"" remixes where they would really shine. This would force out some of the secondary songs, but would leave much better versions of what remains."
4,"Good, but not the ""Best""","This CD should be viewed as a supplement to, not a substitute for, Substance. This compilation focuses on post-Substance singles, with some older material thrown in rather haphazardly. Several of the tracks here are remixes or remastered. It's a strong compilation, but does not really represent New Order's best work."
4,"Great, but not a complete ""best of"" compilation","I first got this cd in 1995 in hopes of getting some songs of New Order that I didn't know the title of, & basically cuz I didn't feel like paying over $20 for ""Substance"". That mission was complete, although they left out ""Perfect Kiss"" & ""Temptation"", even though I didn't know these songs then (I just might have to get ""Substance"" anyway). I really didn't listen to this cd much when I got it, rather it grew on me over time. And once it grows on you, there's not stopping it. There's so many addicting songs on here. Besides the usual radio/club favorites, some other good songs include ""Dreams Never End"" (especially the beginning of the track) & ""Touched by the Hand of God"". I do wish they had included the original of ""Blue Monday"" as well as the '88 remix."
3,"Not as good as the import version ""Best of""","I orginally had ""Best of"", an import version of this (dark blue squiggle). I replaced it with this one. Just not the same. Kind of disappointed ... but still good. I need to replace my original ""Best of"" though ..."
3,Not Joy Division,"Without Ian Curtis, it's not the same but it's fun. Too much pop, not enough message."
4,Great Rack! To Go.....,"I have had this for about 6 months and travel with it quite a bit. It is very rugged and is still going strong. It could probably use a bit more padding on the front and back flaps to keep knobs, etc. from being smashed in. My work around for this was to find some packing foam sheets and jam it in the case around all of my gear. Many thousands of miles and with no issues so far."
5,Red Clay & Vinegar: Looking at Family Through the Eyes of a,"I heard Naomi speak at a conference on parenting and families recently. I was moved to tears when she spoke about the love she has for her 100 year old mother and cried again when I read her words in print. Naomi helps us understand that it is our responsibility to ""teach"" our children and others how to be good parents because if we don't,how else will they know? I admire this women and loved the book."
4,Almost Perfect,"I've been an adoring fan since I met her. She used to live down the street from yours truly in Newcastle, Australia & one day she came home from England for a family visit(very early in her incredible career..around 1972)& this 7 year-old fan caught a peck on the cheek. A day I'll never forget. This compilation is one of the best there is & the bonus disc only adds to the treasures contained herein. I've deducted one star for the inclusion of the loathsome Grease Megamix..."
2,incorrect packaging of CD,"I received this CD, but it wasn't the same as pictured on Amazon. I really wanted the one that is orange in color. This is not what I received. I'm a true fan of Olivia's. Wonder why I received the wrong CD?"
5,The best of her 'best of' collections,"A wonderful double cd collection of 31 hits that every longtime and recent Olivia fan will enjoy. Has most of the songs from the American issue (lacks ""Deeper Than the Night"" and substitutes the ""Grease Mega Mix"" for ""You're the One That I Want"" and ""Summer Nights."") and tacks on later hits like ""No Matter What You Do"" and ""The Rumour"" on a bonus disc. The highlight is the inclusion of ""It's Always Australia For Me."""
4,Not recieved item,I recieved Oliva the singles from 1992-1971 Which I like but this item Oliva the singles I ordered but haven't recieved.
3,"olivia, the best","the best singer of the world continues recording, do you now? olivia newton-john actualy is living in Australia e singing more then ever. the singles Cd is a peace of a great and important carrear for a new generation of fans. enjoy it"
3,Not as inclusive as it should be (1975 ed.),"The 1975 edition has MANY omissions (e.g., all of the battles of Megiddo, the battles of Kadesh, etc.). I would strongly advise that anyone interested in this book obtain the later edition.That said, I have to also say that Harbottle's ""Dictionary of Battles"" is one of the handiest reference books ever written for anyone who needs to know a little bit about a whole lot of military history, such as the story of the Battle of Puebla which spawned the Cinco de Mayo celebrations in the United States and Mexico, or the role of the French fleet at the Battle of Yorktown.Get the most recent, updated, revised edition which you can find. Not only have new battles been added, but corrections and additions have been made to the text in reference to earlier battles. My 3 star rating is for the 1975 edition; look for a newer one and you'll probably find it to be a 4 star addition to your reference library."
4,Great FIT AND FEEL,"I needed women's boxers to wear after surgery for several weeks until my incision healed. I bought two different brands. By far and away, Wickers Performance women's boxers were the best. They were a little pricey, but they are incredibly comfortable, hug your legs without binding -- which makes them practically invisible under slacks or shorts -- and feature a very soft fabric.I may even buy more despite the fact that I no longer need to wear them."
4,Exceptionally Comfortable,"I stumbled upon this item while I was searching for a split slip. I decided to purchase one pair to see how I liked them and was very pleasantly surprised at how comforable they are. While they are 2-3 times more expensive than regular underwear, I plan to purchase more. I've not yet worn them with a skirt but know they will be ideal with skirts, especially in the summertime. The only minor issue I have (and why I didn't give them five stars) is that the waistband is a little more snug than I'd like it to be as the rest of the fit is perfect (so I don't want to go up in size). I'd definitely recommend them to a friend."
4,keepin cool,These do keep me cool in this intense summer heat. They are well made and launder well. I will definately purchase more.
4,great under dresses in hot climates,"I purchased these after reading a reviewer who moved to the Caribbean and recommended them -- they were perfect to wear under dresses or skirts while traveling in hot, humid climates. My only complaint is that they are very high-waisted, which is the reason for the 4-stars. I would hope the manufacturer will make a lower-rise product in the near future -- I would definitely purchase them."
3,Her poetry is very decent (oct:11th:2002),"When I read her only some few poems,I thaught,How Deep She is,I found her in the state of solitary.but she did very fine work,I like it,well,If she can hear me,I advise her to continue her poetry...."
3,Ephesians review,"The Bible Study gets you started in the right direction, but it's not terribly deep. There is a lot of good material to show consistent connections to other Biblical passages, however if you want to discuss Ephesians and only Ephesians, this should not be your main source. It's a good secondary aid, though."
1,Flat greek bouzouki tunes,"Dimitriou gets a lot more attention for her outragous interviews and arguements with b-class greek celebrities than for her music these days . Listening to "" Kane Stin Akri "" makes it easy to understand why . It's bad written , it's been done before and frankly it's quitte charmless . Her heavy , 'laiki' voice is surely a rare delight for many of her fans in this country but it's not enough to elevate releases like this one to an interesting level ."
2,Not the Book I was looking for,"I have a Husqvarna Chain saw and thought this manual might be of help in keeping it running.The Husky owner's manual states that the fuel filter should be changed monthly. This is basic preventative maintenance or repair.Neither the Husky manual nor the Chain Saw Service Manual get into this. If it's in this book, I couldn't find it.Repair doesn't get more basic than this.I'm still looking for a helpful chainsaw book."
2,Missing Hands on data and how to,Comes with all data and was very good at facts but was disappointed in lack of knowhow on how to do things like compression check a saw for leaks to get started. It tells you what you need to do but lacks how to do it. Other than that it had a lot of technical data usable for all saws.
5,Great,"I was amazed to see this game for sale here, its almost extinct!Great expansion, if you don't know the game, youtube it an learn before buying."
5,A good page-turner.,"It was pretty weird to find a book written by my old High School Theology teacher. He was always telling stories in class... and often in costume!Apparently, Mr. Stivender still tells some pretty good tales. I really enjoyed the book."
1,Not worth renting,I did not care it was an old movie but it was just bad and I would not have watched it for free !
3,"Interesting idea, flawed execution","It was an entertaining idea; sort of a ""how I wish it were so"". However the execution showed metal not decomposed, walking on wood decks that wouldn't have borne weight, railings and lines that could not have survived and similar anomalies. The concept HAS been tried with some success with smaller vessels, but we now know she broke in two while sinking.Still if you looked at it as fiction with quite a bit of license in the story telling you find yourself wishing it were so. The movie was entertaining enough to watch and wish."
2,Where are the originals?,"Hey, I bought this CD thinking that I would really enjoy good 80's music that too from Gazebo my favorite, but had this rude shock. Why don't they release the original?????. ""I like chopin"" was one ma favorites, but they have spoiled the song my remixing, and rerererererecording it. I am sorry for offending his fans, but u see, am also a Gazebo's fan.. The question is can I get a original version of his????.. Plz contact me if any of u find one....Regards Mohan"
5,Great read!,"Chris Erskine writes a column in the Los Angeles Times every Thursday which I look forward to reading. When I heard he wrote a book I knew I would enjoy reading it as well. I reccomend the book highly, it is filled with family anecdotes that anybody with children will find familiar and entertaining."
3,Ok,I was looking for a creativity book for Sunday school. I didn't realize that this book is only on the creation. I wanted something more of a variety of range.
4,An outstanding value,"As a basic A/V receiver, you will not find a better value. With 105 watts x 5 channels, Dolby Digital decoding, 6 channel inputs, 4 digital audio inputs, pre-amp outputs, and 5-way binding posts, the Sherwood has features that let you enjoy music and home theater now and well into the future. It is more than capable of doing anything from providing natual, clean stereo music to decoding the digital surround sound from DVD/satellite dish/digital cable to handling 6 decoded channels from a surround format yet to be developed. Amazon rightly lists the lack of S-video switching as a disappointment, but creative wiring can easily work around it. In short, if you want to spend $1000 for a A/V reciever, there are many better options available. But for less than $300, one would be lucky to find a reciever with even one of the Sherwood's many high-end features that sounds even remotely as good as this receiver does."
5,"Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire","A powerful book on the real power of prayer. When I was given this title by a friend to read, I told him I'd put on my reading list of which there are >40 other books. He said ""Put it at the top, I'm reading it for the 7th time""! If you want to know how Christ would have done things in the 20th century, read this book. Cymbala, relies on prayer to bring a multiracial church of just over 20 members to a church of over 6,000. He is not a seminary trained pastor with a slick message. His church does outreach as Christ did, they go where the people most in need live and work. He has great sadness for those pastors rate their value in ""attendance, building and cash, the new holy trinity."" This book is a great testimony as to how God wants us to be, loving, forgiving and merciful, with the people in most need of God. A tremendous book."
4,Powerful,"Great book, really focuses on the power of prayer. Does a great job using stories to keep you interested. Makes you focus on seeking God, and how you can change your surroundings."
5,This book shows the power of prayer today,"In this book the author does not give a bunch of how to's that only apply to one church in particular. He tells the story of how a burden for prayer changed his church around and gives examples of the miracles he's witnessed as a result. I cried and laughed, but most importantly I was convicted by the Holy Spirit. I couldn't put the book down and for me, a non-reader, that's a big deal."
3,Found myself bored,ok read. It had some good points but i just found myself bored at times anxious for it to end.
3,"Great book, Greater lies","This book, while great reading, is full of fabrications and exaggerations. The author appears to portray himself as a man who takes Gods word ver batum, conducts himself in real life as if he believes that he is greater and more authoritative than God himself. This book should be classified as fiction."
5,YES! BUY IT!,"Enough reviews that tell how good this book is, they are true! Just wanted to add to theirs in case someone wants to see what books I reccomend!"
5,good book,good book like the author he does a good job in explaining the faith you have. recommend to others for reading.
5,VERY CHALLENGING!,Pastor Cymbals focuses on our need and mandate from our heavenly Father to fervent prayer in every part of our lives. He reminds us that God is passionately in love with us and we can be filled with His love and passion and live POWERFUL lives if we seek Him. This book has encouraged and changed me.
5,Prayer: A Lost Art,"We in America, have forgotten the art of prayer. We live in a land that is rich and everything is at our fingertips, and we have failed to remember where our blessings come from. Pastor Jim Cymbala reminds us that prayer has power, that prayer is the way we communicate with God, and that God is worthy of all praise. God is bigger than all of our problems or conditions. He is the answer to every situation. Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire breathes new life into the sometimes stagnant walk of faith. Pastor Cymbala uses his own life as an example for those who read this book. Fresh Wind, Fresh Faith will move you and inspire you to worship, praise, and thank the Lord as well as deepen your personal relationship with Him. This book will capture your heart and mind, all for His glory. Reading Fresh Wind, Fresh Faith was time well spent for me so I read it again. I thank God for using Pastor Cymbala in such a mighty way. So will you."
5,This book will drive you to your knees,"I don't know when a book has impacted my life more. It was difficult to finish a chapter without feeling driven to pray. Cymbala shreds most of the ideas which are being touted to promote church growth and replaces these with the convicting and life changing power of prayer. Any one can benefit from this book. A theology student will be chalenged by some of the deep insight Cymbala pours out. At the same time, the teenagers in my Sunday School class are visibly moved by the heart-rending stories of lives transformed through the power of the Holy Spirit, who refashions completely broken people into passionate disciples of Christ's commission, only because a servant of Jesus interceded the throne of God on their behalf."
5,A life changing book...,"This book has truly been ""Fresh Wind and Fire"" in my life and in the life of my church. His mature perspective and observations confront the failure many Christians have experienced in silence; the release of the power of the Holy Spirit through prayer is the key to victorious Christian living. What makes Pastor's experience so powerful is that anyone who is born again can experience the same power through prayer. I would also like to recommend A.W. Tozer's ""Pursuit of God"""
4,A Fresh perspective on *doing* church,"Jim Cymbala, pastor of Brooklyn Tabernacle writes a very challanging and engaging book about the place of God in a Christian's life with a special focus on prayer.In an age where Church Growth experts are constantly focusing on statistical models, programs, and being purpose driven, it is refreshing to read a book that takes a step back and reflects on the larger issue of God's place in the Church and in people's lives.This book is full of personal illustrations and helpful advice. It challanged me and I have recommended it to my congregation."
4,Second time reading - Pray Large,"just a great reminder how important prayer is to all we are going through, it was great read, the one piece that sticks out is Jim's comments about all the Marriage books that are written, and we still have broken marriages in the church, however, just the discipline of praying with your spouse will greatly heal and extend any relationship. I need to PRAY larger prayers"
5,Power of prayer,A great account of how prayer transformed a church and made an impact in an inner city community. Reminds of the central role prayer should play in every church today.
4,"Intriguing,yet,Difficult","A branzen theif steals a priceless artifact while you, Nancy Drew, are setting up an exhibit of ancient Maya treasures in the very next room. The only clue left behind is a mysterious scarlet handprint. Use your wits to track the theif's sinister blood-red signature through a maze of long-buried secrets in this thrilling 3D interactive mystery. Don't delay-unless,you find the answer soon, you might become just another part of history!Clearly, the game,(like all the others)produced an exciting and intriguing plot. Eerie music surrounds you as you venture through the museum looking for clues and question eyebrow- raising suspects. The game itself is somewhat more challenging than the others in it's series. I have not been able to uncover the person behind all the mayhem. I have Windows XP, and I have never run into a problem with installation, sound/music, or the display. But if you're really in to mysteries and interactive games, then this is the game for you!"
3,Lots of unnecessary running around,The main plot of the game was interesting but the puzzle games seemed very aggrevating at times. You have to write down everything and try to put things in a correct order. If you get something wrong you have to search evrything all over again. The puzzles vere based on facts from the museum and didnt really require anything else. I'm glad i played the game I'm a fan of Nancy Drew but I think other Mysteries were way more interesting.
2,A snooze compared to other ND games,"I'm an older ND fan. I've played at least 5 of the games, and this one is such a bore!! I bought it because of the great reviews. I can barely play for 5 minutes before I feel like doing something else. Castle Malloy, Crystal Skull, and Blackmoor Manor were excellent. The Wolf one was great too! I may not even get through this one."
5,One of Her-Interactive's best!,"I LOVE this game! The plot is intriguing, the gameplay submersive and interesting, the characters are unique, the music is great, and the setting is wonderful as well! :) (And just so you know, I AM a critiquer, so I would tell you if I disliked something ;)) I also love the history about the Maya thrown in there--GREAT game! I would highly recommend this, I believe it is one of Her-Interactive's best! :)~Laura"
3,Disliked the most of all Nancy Drew games,"My family loves Nancy Drew games, but this one lacked something. There are points of the game you have to wait to call people or wait for packages to arrived to move on in the game. There was a patch that might be needed if you find the game freezing up when calling Bess or George for a hint (We downloaded if off the Herintertainment website). If you have enjoyed all the other games then most chances are you will want to give it a try, but if playing Nancy Drew for the first time, try one of the others."
4,"Better than others, Not as Good as Some","In this Nancy Drew Interactive Mystery game, Nancy Drew gets an internship as deputy curator in Washington D.C. at Beech Hill Museam. But just before the new Mayan exhibit is to be launched, one of the museam's most valuble artifacts is stolen! This game is super fun and one of the best Nancy Drew games avalible! It has some flaws with the plot, and sometimes gets a litte frustrating, but this game is still great. If you like challenging puzzles, and are intrested in learning a little more about ancient Maya life, this game is for you!!!"
2,"One of the hardest ND games, IMO","I have played all the ND games. This was one of the hardest, to me. Just too much brain work. But it had a great story! Can't say I'd ever give any ND game 1 or less stars."
3,an overall okay game,"I have played all the Nancy Drew games and this one is overall a good game, but not my favourite. The graphics are excellent, they keep getting better and better. The next game after this, Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake is even better, I cannot wait for the Haunted Carousel to come out!"
5,Good Game!,"I love this game! It is so cool! The setting is so cool! There is a subway so that you can get from one place to another easily. And, BOY, does that come in handy! You end up visiting TONS of places, such a The Mexican Consulate, the hospital, your hotel, an office building, and many other places. You also learn all about Mayan culture."
3,Yawn,"I've got to say; you have to have an interest in ancient culture to play this game. It gets pretty boring otherwise. Also, I am stuck at the part of the cave where you have to answer what Pacal was afraid of. I tried talking to the hospital-bound what's-his-name, but he didn't know and now the hospital is closed, apparently never to open again. This must be a glitch of some sort and it really annoyed me! This game is nearly impossible so you HAVE to use a hint website--overall, I think, the worst of the Nancy Drew games I've played so far."
5,Favorite,"This was my favorite Nancy Drew. I loved the level of difficulty - pretty difficult but not frustrating. The Mayan setting was really cool, the music and ambiance really drew you into the game and the plot was interesting and complex. The puzzles made a lot of sense. I loved this game!"
4,Delightful book,"This entertaining book is a mixture of history and mathematics. It tells how the Kelly investment formula can be used to make money in gambling and on the stock market. However, the book gives little insight into the mathematical ideas behind Kelly's formula. The reader interested in this aspect should read the wonderful book ""Understanding Probability"" by Henk Tijms."
4,Great read...,"Interesting stories include Shannon, Thorp, horse racing and the mafia,with some easily accessed theory on gambling and information theory. Application to the 'real world' a bit tricky, as the distribution is usually unknown in advance, and always changing."
5,Phenomenal Book,Maybe one of the 5 best books I've read my entire life. This will help you in all risk based areas of your life.
4,Fortune's Formula: The Untold Story...,Very interesting history of how brilliant people apply their insight & knowledge to beating the casinos and Wall Street. Amazing how simple some of the ideas are. Shows that in many cases there is little difference between betting and investing.
5,More applicable to investors than gamblers!,"First off, for a book that sometimes can get just a little technical and mathy... the author does a great job of tying in the history of gambling in the country, and how that industry drove some key technologies. I found the historical perspective quite entertaining.Second - if you want a 'beat the casino's' gambling system, you'll be quite disappointed. The book reviews the 'Kelly System' to bet sizing once a gambler has an expected 'edge' over casino's. But as we all know, there is no edge at any casino game, unless you cheat. And, although Kelly and friends tried to cheat back in the days (with counting and roullette physics), they don't teach you how.Third - if you are a serious investor in stocks, the book has a refreshing and persuasive approach to determine a) What bets are worth taking, and b) How to size those bets to maximize compound returns. There are almost no good books written on that second subject, which makes this a must read!"
3,Few Formulas,"The work of Thorp and his very impressive associates is fresh and interesting. A review by Gaetan Lion below explains very well, I think. Editors encourage authors to go light on true mathematics, mathematics formulas, and mathematics derivations. The author has done that. While that will be admirable to a general audience and extremely laudable from the editor's point of view, it isn't satisfactory to me. For me, the real learning is done in tracing through the formulas and derivations. For that, the most useful part of the book is the bibliography. Of course, you should understand that I enjoy reading textbooks. This is not really one of them, although I consider it well worth reading for entertainment."
2,Disapointed...,"Too boring. The tips described are good but this film lacks on keeping the audience engaged, I have encountered it repetitive."
2,That's it?,"They purposely edited the stock photo for this cause they cut out the key chain part, as you can see in the customer photo (which I think was added after I ordered mine). My daughter really likes Blue's Clues and she is getting this as a present for her B-day next month. I'm sure she will like it but it doesn't really do enough and I doubt it will hold her attention for more than a few minutes a week. I'm angry that the picture is purposely misleading so they can charge $[...] They also purposely left out measurements, although I should have paid more attention to the weight. NOT satisfied."
2,My kid loves it but......,"It is acatually the size of my hand. It is not normally what i think of as a see and say.It has four ""stations"" and each of the four stations plays the same thing.With that being said my little girl loves it. First it is blue and she can carry it around with her. However even at 19 months SHE thinks it should do more. She presses things that dont press just hoping something will happen."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,Not only was it literally the size of the PALM OF MY HAND but it was beat up and used!!!!
1,horrible presentation,"This item is falsley represented, you think of a see and say as something where you have alot more sayings than the one that this one has, and for more the 2 seconds. Before you even take the toy out of package, you can hear the toy, which means its been played! Depending on how it was positioned in transit, it could have been playing the whole time. I do not recommend buying this toy on line and maybe for a one yr old. I would give it no stars , even for the blues clues lovers !and for the amount you pay , you could buy 6 at the normal cost 5.99very disapointed"
5,Easy recipes,These old recipes are from the depression so therefore pretty basic. It is very informative about cuts of meats to what to do with herbs and how much. Even tells me when to use them and why. This is a good beginners cook book as well as informative for this 60 yr old who has been in the kitchen most of my life as it is my favorite place to be. I very pleased to find such a boon for something this old to still be out there. Thank you Amazon.
5,Great,"Simply this LP lifts SAD above their contemporaries into the realm of Elvis Costello, The Replacements, Husker Du, and The dB's. Unfortunatley they will probably never get the recognition they deserve because the kids to day are too young to know and the folks who would enjoy them the most are too old.One of the ten best bands around today."
4,One of Saddle Creeks Best,"Another one of Conor Oberst's projects - my first thought on this album was ""oh great, another emo band"", but when I popped it in, I was completely addicted. The songs flow into one another like a story to be told. A little rock, a little shoegaze, mixed in with the soulful vocals and that's what you have in this album. Definately one of the best of 2001."
3,Fun but unreliable,"Excellent fun experience. First roll came out amazing, very fun to use but....broke on second roll.lomography has excellent customer support. so as long as you have patience buy it."
2,3 to 4 shots and thats it,"A friend bought me this and I don't actually know how it really works. Because of the flash, my only thought was that, ""Can I shoot it outdoor?""And I did a little experiment indoors first and the flash went off (which is normal) and then, I tried outside and the flash didn't go off. So I thought it was automatic.I sent the film to wash and only 3-4 shots are good (and they're all indoor shots!). I load a new film to my camera again and try one shot indoor. I heard a click but no flash goes off.. Now I'm not sure if I should take more pictures and end up no pictures at all!"
3,Not for night time photography.,"This is a fun little camera, if you are shooting in daylight. Its fun to capture the frames of a fast moving object, but the intervals are almost too close together. Someone has to be running or jumping to get results you want.The flash bothered me as well with this camera. I shot some with it at a small concert hall, I was maybe 8 ft. away from the performer, and the flash did not reach him. The shots I got with the flash were so dark, that facial features were un recognizable, and all that was seen was a little shine off the instruments, and the stage lights. I was shooting with ISO 400, so I expected to get a little more on the film.If I had known these two things before, I probably wouldn't have purchased it. Go with a different lomo camera. I would."
1,lomographic junk,"I purchased the camera on 8/2/06 and shot a roll of film over the course of about 2weeks, when I was finished I tried to rewind the camera and it would not rewind, the film was exposed and ruined. I thought I had done something wrong so I shot another roll of film with the same rusult,the rewind did not work. I reread camera instructions and looked up rewinding instructions on the internet. Like an idiot I shot a third roll of film,the camera is defective""; a piece of junk. I am out 3 rolls of film and irreplaceable photos."
2,Same Thing,"same songs as mountain high valley low - if I would have previewed the cd before buying it, I wouldn't have brought it"
3,the essence awards may 2001,"I've listend to the cd but, ijustwant to know the name of the songshe praised god for on the essenceawards on thursday may 24 2001."
3,"Wanted to like it, but really didn't","Cheyenne Bridges is back in Indian Rock hoping to make a deal with Jesse McKettrick. This deal will go a long way tomimprove the lives of her mother and brother. Jesse McKettrick has lead a good like living off his family's money and playing poker. But one thing Jesse knows is that land is important and his isn't the mood to sell. But it a battles of wills on who will win.""Mckettrick's Luck"" is a book by Linda Leal Miller, I really want to like it, but I really didn't. It seem like a simple story The characters were simple and didn't have any deep emotions to them. Overall ""Mckettrick's Luck"" is a quick read that helps passses the time and not much more"
2,Nice pads but......,"The pads are really nice, I've always been happy with Wagner and always by theirs or AC's parts. However, I was disappointed to find out that they stopped including the abutment clips (I thought they included them in the past, don't remember) and you have to order them separately. Very disappointing."
2,Wrong Size,"This part came quickly and was well packaged. However the part did not fit my 1995 Saturn LS series. It was indicated to fit my car, but was far too small. Check before buying, it was a big disappointment. Had to run out to the store mid-brake change and was unable to get the ceramic pads I wanted."
3,This product is... Ok,The beans and peas were very hard. The flavor of the soup was nice but those darned beans...
5,Please correct,"Love the band, but you have the information incorrect, The band's name is Thr3 and the album is Folklore. Thanks, for your time."
4,Kohler Bidet,"Product functions very well and it is as it represents itself. The only negative may be that the seat is a little smaller than a full size elongated seat and tends to ""squeeze"" your seat. It is comparable to the Toto in function and it is a reasonable price through Amazon. I like the easy to understand remote control and the fact that it is detached from the seat keeps it nice and clean."
1,What a rip off!,"There's no Frampton guitar or vocals on this CD! I don't know where the heck this stuff came from. If you buy this CD, I'm certain you'll be sorely disappointed. It's garbage!"
1,This Is Not A Peter Frampton Album!!,"This album is by someone named Nanette Workman. It's not a Peter Frampton album. Peter Frampton may have played guitar on this session but the final result is nothing like anything you would expect from a Frampton release.The material on this CD is nowhere near the quality of Peter Frampton's work; Nanette Workman is simply not in Frampton's league!! She a backup singer, nothing more.Beware!!! There's nothing about Nanette Workman on the liner notes of this CD. The CD cover is all about Peter Frampton. Very misleading!! (And probably intentionally misleading)"
2,Peter Frampton & Friends - 'Coming Live' (Griffin),"Another cheezy release from the Griffin's series of 'Beat The Bootleggers'.Only complaint here is that the disc isn't what it implies - it isn't a live album.Turns out to be seven tracks of Peter Frampton playing on other artist's songs.It's okay.A couple of tunes here that are worth a listen or two are Gary Wright with ""Love Taker"",Frampton's own ""All I Wanna Be"" and Billy Workman's ""A Woman"" where you can REALLY hear Frampton's stellar guitar playing.Pretty much aimed toward bored collectors and die-hards."
1,This is NOT Peter Frampton,"Some of the music can stand on its own, but this is not a Frampton album."
1,Awful!,"If you want to support the mother of your baby, do not buy this book. Get a Sears book instead, much more useful.The breastfeeding chapter alone is truly awful and untrue! Please support your ladies in breastfeeding, it's the most important thing you can do in the early days."
2,not quite as expected,"When it said this item was in ""very good"" condition, I was not expecting perfection. However, I was not expecting to recieve a stolen library book. I bought this as a present, so in addition to being a stolen library book, which is just wrong, It has the library name stamped all over the book. Mad Sketchy. Not impressed."
3,"Decent, but too brief","This probably should have been ""An Introduction to Being a New Father."" It is extremely brief considering it covers everything from newborn to pre-k. I'll admit it helped me a little bit, but honestly I can't whole-heartedly recommend it. If you can find it for cheap and are looking for more of a light read, then go for it."
2,Damaged goods,"When I received the book, which is a gift for an expecting father, you could clearly see a foot print or tire mark on the package. When I opened it, it was in pretty bad shape. All bent a dented, not very professional. They also do not have a option to ""file a claim"" just the option to return the item, which is a pain especially when this is a gift that needs to be given now. BAD SELLER!"
5,"John Wayne: American is the quintessential biography about the ""Duke"".","This is without a doubt the best biography on Duke Wayne I've ever read. The authors did extensive research as well as one-on-one interviews with many of the important people in Duke's life. I discovered a lot of information about his life that I never read in other biographies. The authors don't mince words and write the good, the bad and the ugly about his life. John Wayne: American has been printed in paperback this year, I suppose to commemorate the thirty year anniversary of his death. However, the paperback version costs as much as the hardbound version did back in '95. You should be able to find Duke's bio. at your local library, or possibly at Hamiltonbooks.com at a reasonable price. If you only read one biography about John Wayne; this is the one you should read pilgrim!"
2,Condition of the book,"I enjoyed the story of the book but was very unhappy with the condition of the book. I ordered and paid for a new book but received a dirty, used book"
5,An excellent look into the personal life of the Duke.,"Of all the Duke books I have read, this one was perhaps the best at bringing his personal life onto the same level as his professional life. This book was able to combine the two and show the Duke as a hard working professional trying to balance his two different lifes, and the struggles involved. I have always been a Duke fan and this book showed me why."
5,montana mavericks books 9-12,These were great stories. Easy to read and very interesting. I enjoyed them very much and the book sets were great way to buy.
2,Mismatch,"Lovely voice, but the song selections on this CD do not do it justice. I should have read the reviews before I made this purchase."
2,Just Before Sunrise,"Gene has a wonderful voice, very strong and clear. However, I don't really care for his selection of songs. Just not as enjoyable as I had expected."
2,Opera singers should stay away from showtunes and pop songs,"I LOVE musical theatre and I LOVE Opera. Unfortunately, opera singers usually cannot do musical theatre justice. There are very few opera singers that can sing musical theatre (Rise Stevens in her prime, Rodney Gilfry and Dawn Upshaw).The rest should stick to what they are trained to do. Gunn has a beautiful voice and he clearly knows to how convey feeling and emotion in this singing. However, his voice is simply too operatic for pop/showtune/standard repertoire."
2,First LISTEN to the samples before you buy the CD!,"Even though no samples were available to listen to on the date that I bought this CD, I still decided to buy it because I like traditional Balkan music, I saw that all the profits will be donated to Doctors Without Borders, and I happened to find the previous reviews helpful.I really love folk music of Macedonia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, etc...I also listen to Ivo Papasov, Yuri Yunakov, Ferus Mustafov, etc...However, you should be aware that, even though all the songs in this CD contain balkan music elements, their styles are far from traditional Balkan styles: You will find techno, thrash, house...If you like not only Eastern European Music but also those styles, buy the CD. But if you expect to hear more traditional music try other CDs. For example: Ciganine by Sviraj, Balkanology by Ivo Papasov, Macedonian Wedding Soul Cooking by Ferus Mustafov, etc...(...)"
3,Mixed Balkan bag for yuppies,"More interesting than good.Some good authentic tunes (16 for example - a soulful and tragic mini-opera), some thin ones (7),some commercial bs (6,13), some modern re-interpretations of 2nd generation Balkan kids from the West.One out of the blue Jewish ballad (!?) - sad and beautiful, but totally out of place.Even a Polish song - they not Balkan, my doctors with no geography sense, but who cares, I guess.Briefly, really a mixed bag, some interesting songs, some dull ones, might be ok if listened to while slightly intoxicated, or if MD."
4,Worth it for Insurgent Mexico/War in Eastern Europe,"John Reed lived a short and adventurous life. This three part compilation of his works was excellent to read because of Insurgent Mexico, and the War in Eastern Europe. Both are excellent, and are worth buying this book for its historical importance and for our modern experience in these regions. If Mexican history and Eastern Europe interest you, this is a great read. I enjoy journalistic accounts, and this book really fits the bill. 10 Days that Shook the World is interesting as a period piece and to see that the Commies perhaps duped him but is not as fascinating as the first two works."
2,Quality not what expected,"Very flimsy and too shallow. Hard to handle and fill the sections without getting the melted ""chocolate"" everywhere but in the molds."
1,Norton Ghost a Bust,"I have a shared drive on a small network running XP. Ghost is an old DOS program which doesn't like shared drives, doesn't like networks and doesn't like XP. Strongly recommend purchasing something else for this application.P.H.Woods"
1,Pathetic!,"The recovery CD program would not work. It would start up, but the menu options for recovery would hang the system.There is ZERO support. The online support is totally worthless, and otherwise you pay big bucks.I am demanding my money back on this total junk."
1,Could not even get to install the product,"I got Ghost 9.0 included with Norton Internet Security 2005. I'm usually a very big fan of Norton products, however this time, I got quite a few headaches.First, installing Internet Security 2005 would have problems while running LiveUpdate. I'm guessing it was having some conflicts with my previously installed Norton SystemWorks. Anyways, after uninstalling everything, and reinstalling, Internet Security and SystemWorks were up and running.Then I decided to install Ghost 9.0. I had read on Amazon about all the problems people were having with 9.0, but I decided to be a bit adventurous. Turned out to be a total flop show. Every time I tried to install Ghost 9.0, it would hang my PC. I finally gave up. Will probably use the Nero software I already have or purchase the Acronis software that others have been raving about."
1,A Bloated Mess - Stick with NG 2003,"Norton Ghost 9 is a bloated and buggy mess, complete with an interface that does not at all resemble other Symantec/Norton products.Its backups are much larger than those made with Norton Ghost 2003. Using Ghost 2003 I could back up my entire hard drive to one blank DVD, whereas Ghost 9 insists on using two DVDs.Furthermore, it even deleted the drivers for my two optical drives!Backing up a hard drive within Windows has been compared to trying to service an automobile while it is moving down the highway. Ghost 2003 may seem ""clunky"" and ""old fashioned"" in dropping back into DOS, but that is a fundamentally sounder approach.My ""bottom line"" is that one should definitely stick to Ghost 2003."
1,Find another way,"After using Norton products exclusively since I first started working with computers, Norton Ghost 9, Norton System Works 2005, and Norton GoBack 4.01 have forced me to look for alternatives. Norton products have turned into bloated, low usefulness time wasters that absorb your money and yield little or no return. After working with Norton Ghost 9 for the last week, I give up! It locks up in every configuration possible after 6-7 hours of a-l-m-o-s-t completing your backup. An extremely frustrating waste of time, money, and effort. My advice - find another way - I will!"
1,Great program if you hate your computer!,"When I complained to Microsoft about my computer's hanging up, I got the reply that it was GHOST; that Symantec knew of the ""GHOST"" problem but had no fix for it. Symantec in many words confirmed Microsoft's comment. GHOST blocks every new program or alteration of old ones I tried to install. Symantec wants more money to help me solve the problem they don't know how to solve. The program (GHOST 9.0) doesn't even include an ""Uninstall."" It's a high negative, a cancer that irradiated with ""Removal"" will return one's computer to health."
1,It's like skydiving while locked in porta-potty....,"My experience with Ghost was crappy I actually tried to flush the cd down the toilet. I bought Ghost for the migration utility. My initial attempts on Windows XP SP2 were discourging. The program kept complaining that it did not have the right instance to scan the drives. I tried reinstalling to no avail. I updated the program and it made a valiant effort after appearing to be working for 4 hours. Bottom line: not for migrating data from a small drive to larger one, especially if the drive is your bootable.At this point, I don't trust Ghost with my data, even if it did pull through the migration. It would be easier and faster to just copy the data and MBR over myself. This is not worthy of Symantec or any self respecting software developer (like me)."
1,Norton Ghost 9.0 - A dangerous weapon,"Hosed the OS on both my machines. It seemed perfect at first -- the app said I had created images, written to an external HD...no problem. Then when I go to restore the images, after what looks to be a seamless restore process, my computer is DEAD. Can't find system files, keyboard failure, etc. I feel sorry for anyone who uses this product, expecting it to do what it is supposed to do. It simply is a dangerous application that does not work -- and it will nuke your system. Not even worth one star on the rating level. I wish I could give it a negative -5 star rating to overcome the obvious shills who write positive reviews on this product."
3,"Good product,. Too bad it's Symantec","Ghost 9.0 et al was originally Drive Image by Powerquest. Drive Image was agreat product with good support. Symantec bought Powerquest and renamed DriveImage ""Norton Ghost"". I only bought Ghost because I know Drive Image is agood product. Symantec added a few inconsequential features but now provideszero technical support. Good luck if you have a question not on their FAQ site.Every year Symantec does another insignificant change, calls it a higherversion and charges twice what Drive Image cost, again with no support.Try Acronis next."
1,Norton product without the typical Norton quality,"Peter Norton's organization is becoming more and more like Micro$oft every day. They bought PowerQuest and simply re-branded it. This used to be DriveImage, and what's funny is that when it was a PowerQuest package it seemed to work. I would HIGHLY recommend Acronis True Image instead of this piece of junk. Symantec (Norton) should focus on Utilities and things they are good at, not buying other companies and screwing up what they USED to do RIGHT."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Gee, I wish I had read the other Amazon reviews before I downloaded this instead of having to learn firsthand. The worst thing about it isn't it not working, it's Symantec trying to charge you $50 to tell you how to get it to work. Their online documentation on the product is rubbish, their marketing is good though. Final verdict: It is trash, DO NOT BUY IT!"
1,Danger - Warning - Does Not Work When You Need It,"Do not rely on Norton Ghost 9.0 if you ever need to recover a primary disk drive. It does not work to recover a Windows XP Primary Drive (the one you boot from) to a replacement drive in most situations. If you have read the Help that comes with the software you know more than their technical support folks that are located in India (the one I spoke with was very difficult to understand). Symantec's knowledge base is very limited and of little help, mostly just repeating information in the product Help. Recommend you find a different solution that works."
1,Worst Norton product ever.,After installing Norton Ghost 9 my system completely hosed up. I could no longer share my network drive. The cloning features did half work and when booting from the CD it took over 10 minutes with a 2.4GHz system with 512 MB DRAM. This product has been a complete disappointment.
2,Norton Ghost 9.0,"Having tried several backup products Norton Ghost 9.0 is fair if you can get it to work on your hardware. I have a Sony DRU-510A DVD drive that is does not work with. In addition, it could not backup to my external USB hard drive. Ghost gets about 2% done and gives me a drive error. When it does work it, seem ok but the boot CD takes a long time to start. I would not buy this product again or anything from Symantec because they have no free tech support. Their web site states free email support but no email address, after calling them they told me they have telephone support, for a fee.I find that drive snapshot works well but does not compress the backup or write to CD drives. But it's very fast very fast."
1,Horrible Tech Support,"I installed this program on WinXp service Pack 2. The program installed incorrectly and was absolutely unusable. I went to the support page and searched the knowledge base. I found that most of the articles were just straight from the documentation, which of course doesn't exactly help when you have errors. I then sent a message to the tech support for help. Its now been 5+ days and nothing. I assume they will never respond. You have to pay to call. So after editing my registry and uninstalling/installing serveral times I think it is now in a usable state. But now I don't really trust the software to back up my data."
1,THE WORST TECH SUPPORT EVER,"I'm really disappointed with Symentec. I can't understand how symantec sells software that does't work. I installed it and everything since to go well until I tried to activate it. It was IMPOSSIBLE!!!!!! I tried typing the CD Key lowercase, then uppercase and it made no differece. It didn't work. Then I tried contacting Symantec's tech support and i'va got no answer. The online support doesn't help either. It's like the user's manual, so it doesn't give eny new information about.It's been 15+ days since I contacted Symantec by phone and by email and I haven't received any solution yet. So I think I'll be returning this piece of sh....For those of you that might be thinking about buying this program, please consider another options first or wait some time before buying it in order to give Symantec the oportunity to solve all the problems."
5,New seiko fan? Try this album!,"Among all her wonderful works, this is probably one of the best albums. You will enjoy the resort sound created by the finest Japanese musicians as well as Seiko's sweet voice.Please note that this was published as one of the first music CDs in the whole world. It suggest how high the quality of Seiko's music was then. As well as Walkman, Seiko's music is something Japan can be proud of, and introduce to the world with a lot of confidence. Walkman and Seiko were both created by Sony!A very famous jewel piece, Akai Sweet Pea is the most popular song among seiko fans in Japan. It is the song every girl likes to sing for their boyfriend."
3,Motors breaking down,"Motors were a mid/late '70s almost there band. They were considered NEW WAVE, mostly because they were English and a tail wind back from Elvis Costello and less popular better looking fake torn t-shirt so-called punks.Motors had a terrific, yet NOW traditional sound, but at the time was like a grin and a YEAH! Never a pop hit in the US, but those who collected records, collected Motors.I have colored vinyl LPs of Motors and their 45s. They were fun and of a time.Motors run!"
3,'Coulda been a contendah',"These guys released two albums.Couldn't they - or their label - have dropped some of their'hits' so there would be room for the complete version of theirtrue masterwork?I am referring to DANCIN' THE NIGHT AWAY.If that was on this CD, a copy would most likely be winging its way to me. Instead, I keep searching............EDIT: Wow...here it is 6 years later and I find that this CD now does include the full length version of DANCIN' THE NIGHT AWAY.I stand corrected & in the immortal words of Emily Litella, ""Never Mind...."""
4,Debbie's writings,"I have not had a chance to read this book but I do receive her weekly column, Family Daze e-Column. I thoroughly enjoy her writings. She is very humorous and many times says the things that I wish I had the talent to write or say. She helps to brighten up everyday happenings and gives the spirit a lift. I would recommend her writings to anyone, especially, mothers of all ages!"
4,Humor is the *Best* medicine!,"I have enjoyed Debbie's column for a long time...she always helps her readers see the fun side of parenting and lets us know that we are not in this adventure alone. If you need a good laugh (and who doesn't?), this book is for you! Even better: Buy two copies and give one to a friend who is also a frazzled parent!"
5,ALL BOOKS SHOULD BE THIS MUCH FUN,"Debbie Farmer has done it again. With fun and witty stories that allow parents to reflect and laugh at themselves, this book is a real treasure. It does my heart good to know that I am not alone in this big and often times messy world of parenting. If you are a fan of Erma Bombeck, Bruce Cameron or Karen Scalf Linamen you'll love Debbie Farmer. A fun and heartwarming read for anyone who has children in their life."
4,Updated Erma Bombeck...,"Yeah, as an ardent fan of her columns, I think this book captures the flavor of her weekly ministrations perfectly. Highly recommended. Debbie Farmer has updated Erma Bombeck for the 21st century.Cameron"
5,Wow...what a laugh!,"This author is skilled at painting a picture of the most hilarious scenarios you can imagine. As a parent and a parenting newmagazine publisher, I love reading about all the zany things that happen to us in everyday life. Ms. Farmer lightens and brightens family life. Keep on writing and we'll keep on reading!"
5,Finding the humor,Debbie Farmer helps parents find humor in the sometimes overwhelming job of parenting. Reading her stories makes me wonder if she has been a fly on the wall in my home at times.
1,Debbie Farmer,"I haven't read ""Don't Put Lipstick On The Cat"" but I subscribe to her weekly newsletter, and I have to say I enjoy all her stuff, she is a funny gal."
4,Good Boot for the Price!,"This is the second time I have purchased this boot, and I would have to say ""Its a great deal, and a good work boot"". Even though these boots ""Can"" last up to a couple of years on the outside, I purchase a new pair ""Every year"" just because the inside comfort doesnt last that long. I use these boots for climbing poles and standing on ladders 30ft in the air. Only found two downfalls about these, 1. Moisture does seem to get to my socks and feet after a couple of months of wear. 2. You can feel the steel shank on the bottom of your foot when wearing the boots, wich make them a little uncomfortable. I will continue to buy unless I find a more comfortable boot for the same price."
4,nice boots,These were a Christmas Gift and the person who I bought these for loved them and were exactly what they wanted.
4,Great fun to see them back in action...,"Okay... if you're like me and you've read reviews on Laurel and Hardy's post-Hal Roach movies you'd expect these films to be just dreadful. Well... take a look for yourself. It is terrific to see Stan and Babe in new situations and surroundings. I like these films because, like many of the 20th Century Fox films of the period, they are a great slice of life during World War Two. These films were money makers for Fox... the public really liked them on their original release.So, if you like Laurel and Hardy and have never seen these films, it's like a surprise visit from two beloved friends.On the technical end: The extras and the commentary are great. The prints are very good for ""A Haunting"" and ""Bullfighters."" The ""Dancing Masters"" print is very worn."
3,Anglais seulement- English only !!!,"J'aurais aimé que ce nouveau coffret soit dans plusieurs langues ou au moins soutitré comme TCM archives c'est le faire ,mais apparament ce n'est pas le cas et c'est dommage .I would have liked that this new box is in several languages or at least with subtitles but apparament it is not the case,sorry"
2,She's So Much Better,"All I can say is this was a disapointment. I love NS's books, her phsy/changeling series is fantastic, and I love other books from this line, but this one just didn't do it for me. I felt like the hero had no justification for his treatment of the heroine. I could have bought his reasons for being distrustful if he had somehow been forced to marry the heroine, instead I was left wondering why a man so distrustful of beautiful women would go out of his way to marry one he's never met.Basic plot, guy wants to date girl, girl's father says marriage or nothing, guy agrees, girl marries guy without talking to him, they move to his home and niether trusts the other reasons for marriage."
1,MADCATZ,I received this item defective and I was informed that I would receive a replacement as of about 10 days later I haven't gotten the item or a response as to whether or not the item has been re-shipped or not.
3,"Pretty trifles, decently served","Hyperion, for their Helios series, presents us with a welcome re-release of Seta Tanyel's traversals of the Scharwenka and Moszkowski series originally released by Collins. I snapped up vol. 3 quite arbitrarily to sample the latter composer. Turns out to be (as expected) entertaining but eventually not very memorable music.Moszkowski surely knew how to write for the piano, but was unfortunately short on substance (at least that is the unequivocal impression from this volume). Best here are the Barcarolle (a surprisingly good piece) and the irresistibly charming 3 Morceaux. The rest is worth a listen, but probably not more. Tanyel plays them fluently though maybe lacking the last ounce of vigour and panache this music needs to come fully alive. The recording is excellent."
1,A GOOD SHOW RUINED BY GREED,"Hayate the Combat Butler,It's a 51 Episode series that Bandai is releasing in 7 eps at a time.It's over priced even for a (Hyb) but this is a subtitle only and theonly possible plus is the lower compression then the import [...]. I enjoyed the series and if itwere dub in English I'd buy it again. Bandai has delayed therelease of it's dubbed titles to release these overpriced subtitledvd's."
4,Informative Book,"Although this publication does not include a considerable amount of information on conservation and ecology issues nor on all commercial specicies, it provides an excellent overview of commerical fisheries in North America and it covers economic topics not usually found in most fisheries biology texts. Also, the hand drawn illustrations show fine details not available in photographes.Provided below are some additional comments:- The two page write-up format is convenient; offers a fair amount of comprehensive information quickly.- It is easy to read, helps you see the big picture.- The book contains background information on species you would not easily find elsewhere- It provides a good update on the commercial aquaculture situation.- It really helps sort out, and put in to perspective, a lot of fish identification issues.Overall comments: I highly recommend this publication."
5,The best ever,I think someone needs to tell Greg Jones that NMA have not split up and him writing that review as recently as september 1998 ought to know of the existence of the strange brotherhood album relased earlier this year!
4,"Historic plane, fun winter project.","After watching Jimmy Stewart in the movie ""Spirit of St. Louis"", I decided I wanted to build a flying balsa-wood model as a winter project. It was easy to find and order on Amazon.Com. It arrived quickly and I am delighted with the kit. It will test my limited experience with balsa-wood models but the drawings and instructions seem very complete. Thanks to Amazon and the supplier, both were very helpful."
