5,One of the Best Books I've Read!,"I' ve read a lot of books, and this book was one of the better ones I have read. It shows what life was like for one of the most famous princesses in the world. It also is a good book to read if you would like to get an idea of what life was like in the sixteenth century for young girls. I would recommend this book to anyone who was curious about buying it. Why? I have read three Royal Diaries books (Elizabeth, Cleopatra, and Isabel), and this one was one of my favorites. It has humor and history mixed in as one. Also, this book is the easiest to relate to. It deals with the pre-teen years of Elizabeth, and would be a good book for fifth graders and kids over that age. I enjoyed this book and I am sure you will too!"
5,"Superbly written, good insight into Elizabeth I's girlhood","Though probably mostly a work of fiction, this book is a wonderful look at what Elizabeth's childhood was probably like. It is funny and entertaining, and a good read. Long Live The Queen!"
4,Good Historical Fiction.,"I rate this 4 stars because the story sometimes lost my interest, but in the end it was very succsessful. I really enjoyed the platonic relationship that Elizabeth and Robin had, also this is a important part of history and I'm sure that the book isn't completely based on fiction. The book also had facts and immangination, which made it seem more real and exciting.I recommend this book for everybody of all ages that enjoys historical events and facts and just history itself."
4,Good read,"I enjoyed this book greatly, however, there were some things about Elizabeth's character I did not enjoy. I did not care for her selfishness. For example, throughout the entire book she moans about never becoming Queen. But, there are other parts that more than make up for that, like when she threatens Princess Mary, I thought that was classic."
3,Red Rose of the House of Tudor,Elizabeth is a young princess but lives a life being unloved. She yearns constantly for her father's love and is even exiled by him at times. She seems invisible to those around her. But as the book progresses she must stop Mary from taking advantage of Edward. Also Queen Catherine looses favor with the king and just may loose her head. But being celever and well educated Elizabeth plans to save the queen and keep Edward from the cunning Mary. I enjoyed the book near half way but it was a bit boring and tame at first.
3,Princess Elizabeth; the Tudor Rose,"This book is based on the life of Elizabeth I starting when she was only 11 years old, it's in the form of fictional diary. The way it is written focuses on Princess Elizabeth's childhood feelings and struggles towards everyone important around her especially her anger and irriation towards her older half sister Princess Mary Tudor and her own fear of disappointing and angering her father King Henry VIII and being thrown into exile. Princess Elizabeth constantly brings up the fact that she feels like she's The Forgotten Princess, of course I'm sure if this narrative continued into her adulthood she'd change her tone once she became Queen Elizabeth I. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, I know the Royal Diaries series is considered for children, I myself had originally read many of them as a child, I still enjoy them now and I'm 19."
5,"Elizabeth I: Red Rose of the House of Tudor, England","The book was in excellent condition, arrived before the anticipated date, and my daughter loved it! Thank you!"
4,Supprisingly Interesting,"Elizabeth I: Red Rose of the House of Tudor was a good book. Most of the time it kept me interested, but sometimes I sorta wandered off....(was it because when I read it it was summer?)Elizabeth was , herself, an interesting female ruler, and Kathryn Lasky made learning about her MUCH more appealing. This book opened the door to the Tudorcourt and the Elizabethean era."
4,Ok Book,"I really like to read books about people and what happened in their life. I have read alot of diaries from different people in different time periods. I found as I was reading that this book starts out medium exciting. In the middle of the book it gets boring and I just felt like starting over on a different book, but by the end of the book I just didn't want to put it down. I really didn't know anything about Elizabeth 1 but after reading this book I would be able to tell you good, bad, and interesting things that happened to her. I found as I read the book that she is like me in many ways. She likes to be outside on sunny days, be around people, be adventurous and free, and she loves animals. It made it easier to read the book because I could look for more ways she was alike me. Even though there were many interesting things that happened in this book I wouldn't recomend this book to a friend. I wasn't really excited to read the book and I went really slow through it."
5,A great book for those who love English history,"Having taken English History in a British school many years ago, I found this book to be very enlightening in reference to this period of time. This book gives a great insight into the formation of the Elizabethian period."
4,Elizabeth I,This royal diary is Elizabeth I account of life under the rule of her father. She is the third hier to the throne with her brother and evil sister ahead of her. This book will teach you about Renassance time period and make you laugh. I would recommend this book.
5,"Elizabeth I, Red Rose of the House of Turdor ( Royal Diaries","This was a very interesting book. I used for a college research and I would think other adults would enjoy this book, if they are a historic fanitc or just like to read books. It makes you feel what Elizabeth might have felt and you can almost hear her boice in the words. I wish the author would write another one about the rest of the Tudor family for instance Lady Jane Grey. I really enjoyed this book again. Way to Go Kathern Lansky!"
4,16th Century Adventurer,"This was a great book. I am glad I read it. If you didn't know the real history it was a good mystery because halfway through the book you wonder if she is going to be banished or have another stepmother die. It is considered fiction because it's written as her Diary. However, I learned alot about her and her family. Although it was fictional it had alot of true facts in it which were very interesting. I recommend this book for people who don't like history because it seemed to be written from the point of view of someone my age. Once you've read this book you want to know more about this period of time. I felt as if I became her and began wondering about the same things she did. I highly recomend this book however, I did like the story of Cleopatra better... maybe because I read it first. It may be a good idea to read Elizabeth before Cleopatra."
3,ok-no action,"Somewhat interesting at first, because you figure something must happen soon,but mainly it is all about her everyday life, continually repeating. Its ok."
1,it was well written but very historically inaccurate,"In the epilogue at the end it said that Elizabeth never harmed anyone for religious reasons. That is very untrue. Elizabeth murdered hundreds of people for just being Roman Catholics! It also portrayed Mary I as being mean, cruel, bloody. Mary never killed anyone for just religious beliefs. She might have killed protestants but it was because they were traitors. I was very upset at the way the author changed these facts. But other than that this book was very good!"
3,It's ok.,"For the price the dvd isn't bad but I didn't find it as relaxing as the other reviewers. Unlike a real aquarium, most of the fish in the video seem to be in a hurry, zipping in and out of frame as if someone is scaring them back into the picture from the sides of the tank. When I had an real aquarium years ago the fish would swim lazily around and very rarely moved at the pace that most of the fish in this video move at. Also, one segment has a long close up sequence of a clown fish going in and out of sea anemone which was a little too much of the one fish.Oh well, like I said, for 4.98 the video isn't too bad."
1,It's like watching three seconds of COSMOS with 1950's theories few believe any longer,"I disagree with the entire spoon-fed premise and ridiculous theories that arent even correct; the theories they try to explain arent even the same theory! As with all under-produced and under-researched shows like this one, ALL they did was interview ""big names"" and they told us nothing.This show is as useless as reading ten books on a subject and writing an eleventh. I see the same points being made over and over in all of these crap-value ""educational"" videos with all bling in the presentation, and near-ZERO substance.I'm CERTAIN they had one person doing ""research"" part time and an entire team of 3D graphic artists working for months on this show. NOVA has ZERO educational qualities in this decade so far."
5,Great way to explain complex concepts,Its very visual with a lot of 3d animations. Simple plain English describing what we know of our universe.With so much miss information from general media its refreshing to get such simple and clear scientific facts and theories.
5,Love Nova ...,Nova did it again ... not only does it pique my interest but that of my children (ages 6 & 8) - this is an extraordinary progam - buy it/watch it - learn !
3,Pretty Usual stuff,"I started watching the Fabric of the Cosmos and personally lost interest pretty quickly. The material is interesting if it is new to you, however if your an avid NOVA watcher it duplicates the material of several episodes over the years."
5,Gift for a nephew,Purchase was a gift for a nephew who is 10 and can recite the elements and has a solar system on the ceiling of his bed room. I thought he would love the Fabric of the Cosmos and he did.
4,Douglas Mallach,Fabric of the Cosmos is an understandable and quick read. The concept that our three dimensional universe is an illusion plastered on to a two dimensional canvas is intriguing and evokes more questions than answers. Looking forward to seeing Brian Greene explain on PBS.
3,Only one available for Prime Account?,"How come the others aren't available for Amazon Prime? Only one is available, yet the other show up under Amazon Prime Free TV shows?"
1,Are you serious?,"This ""Documentary"" is the poorest I've seen on any subject. The propositions are called, ""what ifs"". I didn't see anything that it added to the discussion about our universe. Might be fun for children although I wouldn't show it to my kids."
1,So physicists have gone stupid then?,"The logic behind the theory of the multiverse is so perverted, I am ashamed of this series.The strongest theory for a multiverse, as presented by the show, is latent in the 'extra-dimensions' of string-theory-- but making the leap from extra dimensions of space to alternate UNIVERSES is a JOKE.Saying that the value of Dark Energy, being so 'perfectly small', would be explained by a multiverse , and so SUPPORTS the theory of multiverse , is actually a LOGICAL FALLACY. I SAID LOGICAL FALLACYbut, apparantly according to greene, when three logical fallacies ALL HAVE THE SAME CONCLUSION, then the conclusion just might be true. ...I can't believe how utterly retarded our contemporary physicists are when it comes to breaking the mold. dont watch this show.they should have recorded a lesson on electromagnetism instead . I guess retarded is a little more marketable though =\"
5,Wonderful introduction to modern science,"This is a fantastic BluRay set. Very crisp, HD picture and fantastic, modern science. Very much up to date information from the latest and greatest minds. If you like astronomy and physics and science you'll enjoy this set."
3,Good for the money,This is an ok cover. My only complaint would be that it doesn't fit very snug. We'll need to buy some tie down straps to go over.
1,Dust Cover,"This item is NOT WATERPROOF if your buying this to put on your trailer that sits outside hoping to keep the water off of it do not buy it. I purchased this item a week ago first rain on it today and the water goes right through it,i should have known since you can see through it that it is nothing more than a glorified dust cover an 8 dollar tarp protects it more than this i am returning it."
2,Did not fit :(,"I was very careful choosing this product and read all reviews carefully. Unfortunately, we have an older model (1996 Jayco) with an A/C unit. I ordered the 12-14' cover and it was great on the lenghth and width. However, due to our a/c it would not cover the sides. I was quite disappointed and will continue looking for one that will fit longer sides."
1,Thin material - rips for no reason,"After less than a year, I'm disappointed with the trailer cover. It was quite damp underneath and has holes where the trailer corners are (from just sitting) and a large rip in the center for no apparent reason from use. Certainly not useful for more than a season and not worth the price. Basically it's just a dust cover as long as it doesn't rain."
3,good for 2-3 seasons in the harsh northeast,A bit loose on my popup with 12 foot box but I have no air conditioner. Does not keep it dry but does keep of twigs sap and bird droppings. I would purchase again.
1,Shameful,"I bought this book as a present for my grandparents who are native Cubans. Cuba is a beautiful country with some of the most amazing art, food, music, people, and architecture. This book shows nothing of that Cuba. If you want to see photographs of people living in poverty, than this book is for you. If you want to see the real Cuba, look elsewhere. The photography itself is decent, but the subject matter is just shameful."
1,did not receive,"I never received it. I have been promised a refund, but do not know when or if I will get that."
5,I bought it when they were offering it in white. I am very pleased,I bought it in large and it is still very tight but what they say about it being figuer flatering is true. the fact that both the halter strips and the waist are agustable is what gives it its great fit. I could have worn it less tight but I wanted to wear it moddustly because I was showing it to my mom. this is my summer dress. it is 100% cotton.in white it is simple and pure in red it would be even sexyer
2,Can't tell if it works,"The collar material is cheap nylon and doesn't hold tight on my dog's neck. After a day or two it needs to be readjusted/tightened. Also, the black box where the inaudible noise comes from is bulky, awkward, and huge! Not cool!I don't think this has been an effective bark deterrent and am glad I also bought a shock collar for the same purpose. That has been entirely more effective. Maybe it isn't working? It's hard to tell because I don't see a way to test it and be able to hear it with human ears. I also cannot tell when the battery is dead. This thing needs improvements."
2,Not for squirmy dogs,"This product is OK at best. I got it to curb my puppy's barking, and it has been somewhat effective so far. The problem is, it has alot of ""false alarms"". It does beep when she barks, however it beeps when she shakes, when she scratches, when I take it off her, and sometimes it beeps for no reason at all.So it has curbed her barking for the moment, but I'm not sure how long before she starts ignoring the beep because it goes off so often, she's not going to associate it with barking much longer."
3,Good but NOISY,It worked well for 3 years. It was very powerful BUT noisy! I had to raise the volume on my TV when it was on at the same time as the highest setting of the fan. It was very sturdy but definitely did not last their 10 yr guarantee.
4,Glad to find another one!,"I have had a Patton Hi-Velocity fan for over 10 years and always wanted another. The store where I bought it, dropped the line however, and even calls to Patton did not give me the answers I wanted. I see now where I can buy 1-2 more!Fan is a bit noisy, but does it move AIR!Wouldn't buy another brand at any price."
3,Great Fan - move air - but blades don't last,"The fan works great for a year. Move air well. At times I wish it was a little less powerfull. But the blades cracked after a year. Use metal epoxy, that worked for another year. Then the blades broke in 3 pieces. I am trying to locate another blade, without success so far (7/18/03)"
2,Great fan when it works!,"This is a great fan! With various windows open in my house, and this fan turned on high, I can get a nice breeze going through the house. This fan isn't quiet, but for the amount of air it moves it isn't bad. The problem is the durability. I have owned two of these fans. The first one lasted three years and the second one lasted only two years. Considering what servicing costs, its not worth fixing. When it works, this is the best fan of its type I've ever owned, but at its price I'm not buying a new one every few years."
1,BE VERY WARY OF THIS ITEM!!!!!!!,"I had my 2nd one (HLSU22003UC 20"" High Velocity Fan, 3 Speed, 23""x7""x23"", Chrome) for 3-4 days and it nearly caught fire. NO JOKE!!!! I had the speed set on high and the next thing I know was I heard the motor idling down all of the sudden to the lowest speed possible. I unplugged it immediately and good thing I did, because the motor was extremely hot, and I could smell something burning inside. I have owned 3 of these now in the last 2+ years. One just conked out 3-4 days ago after 2 year of use. Slightly different model than this one listed here though (Patton U2-1887 20-Inch High Velocity Whole-House Air Circulating Fan). Motor/Blades locked up on it. I now have the 3rd one up and running (Patton U2-2003-UC 20-Inch Velocity Air Circulating Fan) and will keep you posted on how this works out."
1,DANGEROUS FAN DO NOT BUY!!!!! MY BLADES FELL APART,Do not buy this fan! The 3 aluminum fan blades have cracks in them and the center collar does not hold the assembly together. Had the fan for a year and used it sparingly. I think this fan should be recalled ...
1,Moves air - but blades don't last,I agree with several of the other reviews here. My fan lasted four years before the 3 aluminum fan blades cracked and the center collar came loose holding the blades together.Do not buy this fan.
4,Effective but noisy,"If you are looking for a light duty fan to provide quite ventilation and cooling, this is probably not the fan for you. On the other hand, if you need to ventilate an area of your house, shop or garage quickly and effectively, and don't mind the noise, then this fan will definitely do the job."
3,New ones obviously chinese junk,"I have had one of these wonderful fans for 9 years. It has always run like a top, and still does. Puts out more air on low speed than most do on high. After reading some of the poor reviews here, it seems the newer ones are not made in New Haven Indiana anymore and the quality has deteriorated. They are now made in China, mostly thanks to W@l-Mart's procurement and business practices of bullying American manufacturers to cut costs to a point products can no longer be made here. My fan has a 25 year warranty and I fully expect it will last that long.So I give it a 3 star rating; an average of a 5 for my old USA made model and a 1 for the new junk throw-away models."
1,RIP for Patton,"Yes, Patton is part of Holmes Inc. and it seems that their products are made in China. The product is a sorry imitation of the original built in the USA. Luckily, I still have one of the American 21 inch fans that I bought at Costco 15 or so years ago and it is still working great. If you want quality, get something else. If you want a 21 inch do a search and you can still find fans made in the US. Will they be as ""cheap"" as the China/Patton, no way but you will get a quality product and keep our dollars here at home!!! The Chinese can copy a design but they have a long way to go on quality."
1,This book is nonsense,This book is nonsense. It spreads the same lies and cult-like thinking that causes good people to strap bombs to their backs and blow themselves up. If you are looking for a message from GOD here it is: GOD DOES NOT REQUIRE YOUR SERVICES ANYMORE. GOD CAN TAKE CARE OF THINGS HIMSELF. IF GOD NEEDED YOUR HELP HE WOULD NOT BE GOD.
4,Enjoyable faux Francais band,Lot's of energy and covers of songs from the 80's and earlier. Most amusing is the male vocalist with the fake French accent. Like Clouseau gone punk.
2,Not worth the money,The great thing about this set is that it comes with a clipper and a trimmer. It feels pretty solid in your hands. There's a lot of bad things about this unit. It does not cut hair well. There was frequent hair pulling. The blades get pretty hot after 20-30 min of uses. Can not cut well through thick hair.
2,WASTE OF MONEY,IT DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY. IT COULDN'T BE LIKE WHAL.I AM SORRY PLEASE DON'T BUY. GREAT PRICE FOR SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T WORK GREAT.
5,A 90s GEM,"The cover...the COVER...once you see the cover of this CD you know you are dealing with a first class latin artist, but thats just a wrap: the best is inside, once you play this CD you are going to experience one of the best latin music artist to come from Puerto Rico: ""Cantare"" is a signature song and is followed with true gems...""Sin Amor"", ""Despierto Sonandote"" And ""Esta Guerra La Perdere"", and if you feel like dancing you can hear the discoteque hits: ""No me Acostumbro"" and ""No Me acostumbro"".BRAVO Yolandita!"
1,Mozart Requiem (Levin Completion),"Terrible! The center of pitch is off the scale (both choral and instrumental). The soloists are amature at best. The orchestra does not play well, nor do they play in tune. The chorus does not display good choral phrasing or choral tone. This is not worth the money I spent on this recording."
1,"Bad recording, overpriced, should be free, bad clarinetist","It's hard to believe how bad this recording is of this most beautiful work. I purchased it because it was one of the few with an ending written by a contemporary, and not usually heard. (Mozart died before he finished the work) It took a long time to arrive , but the worst thing was the sound and the performances. Unfortunate, as this is little better than amateur, and should not be sold as a professional recording, as it is definitely not. Too bad, my loss, but Amazon should have some criterion for selling this stuff. I'm not pleased. Amateur of certainly OK, but not to be sold for a hefty price. DON'T BUY."
2,Bogus,This is irrational that the kindle version of this book is more expensive than the paper one. There is no printing or supplies involved. This item should be more affordable.
1,"good service, poor quality","shipment of belts arrived promptly. No complaints about that but two weeks after installing the belt...it broke. Thankfully, I ordered four belts. Hopefully, this was just a fluke."
1,Generic Knockoffs,"These belts were generic knockoffs of Eureka belts. They were not packaged, just put into the shipping envelope with a printed sheet written in poor English. No indication of the country where the belts were manufacutured. This sheet told you what a good deal you got by the seller choosing to buy them in bulk from the manufacturer, and not having to waste packaging material. Isn't that thoughtful? No printing or numbers on the belts.Genuine Eureka belts come two to a package, have the Eureka name printed on it, and have ""EU TYPE RD"" engraved in each belt. Also, Eureka does not sell their belts in bulk to vendors.Don't be fooled by the words ""Eureka Style."" This is just weasel wording for a cheap imitation of the genuine Eureka belts. The price sounds like a real bargain, but it's not. If it's too good to be true, it probably is. I don't like to be fooled."
1,"Low-quality belts, def not manufacturer replacements","I MIGHT have burned through a belt every six months before, but these only seem to last a couple weeks and they're all stretched out. Definitely NOT the same quality as the Eureka brand."
5,Beautiful book,"Very inspirational, lots of great tips to prepare you. While the projects are Not for the beginner quilter, the book will make you want to start planning for when you have more experience. Great advice for selecting fabric."
2,Inspirational quilting book,"I really like this book. It offers many ideas and instructions on how to quilt with color design. It allows your creative juices to flow. The book was delivered on time, but I ordered a used book in excellent condition and received an acceptable rated book in poor condition. The front cover was partially torn off, the previous owners name was scribbled on the first page, and there were children's' markings on several of the pages. This is clearly a seller getting rid of a poor quality book by substituting it for an excellent used book. I love the book, but am dismayed that the seller sent a book in poor condition."
5,Bearing Straight to the Top,"My husband and I had the priviledge of listening to this group on (a tv show). Wow...they were truly wonderful...a soulful country sound mixed with great musical talent!! We immediately went to the store and purchased the CD, which is something we NEVER do. I love every single song on this CD, which is another very rare thing to occur.We wish them much continued success and will be looking forward to their next CD!"
4,A very talented group!,"I just saw this brilliant group in Oshkosh, WI last night and I have to admit I am slightly sadened by their management and promoters. It seems to me everyone wants to ""label"" this group to being a country group. I believe they have a sound and talent of their own in which should not be labeled country at all. After listening to their CD I must say I was not as impressed as I was as listening and seeing them live. I was able to see and hear the strong voices of the girls and great talented of all. They seem to be themselves in concert which was more rocking bluegrassy funky, where as on the CD, someone told them to play counrty music because it sells. Let me say this, Bering Strait, I truly hope this second CD coming out sounds more like the real and talented Bering Strait that you are."
2,Gems within a dismal offering,"This is probably the worst album I have ever bought. Lured by the airplay of two fantastic, upbeat, quick-picking gems, the intro to the title piece, Bearing Straight, and the traditional Porushka-Paranya, which I adore, I was shocked to find an album of melancholic, insipid, twangless and lifeless country built on fragile vocals and sad dobro strums. It falls on the feckless border between bad pop country and the bad public radio version of folk music that airs on Sunday nights just about everywhere. The musicians are extraordinarily talented and the two stars are for the two songs I love. The other songs add up to nothing."
1,Overproduced Nashville Garbage,"I saw an interview with this group on T.V. and heard another wonderful interview on N.P.R. I was impressed with the story and the collective talent of these young musicians. They are obviously, not just another ""Hat Act."" It was refreshing to find that they embraced bluegrass music so wholeheartedly, especially considering their heritage.I haven't given up hope that someone will allow this group to shine in the Bluegrass music field. However, this cd won't do it, as a friend of mine would say, ""it sucks scissors."" Never have I been so disappointed in a music purchase.Someone in Nashville once again has taken greatly talented musicians and turned their cd into overproduced schlock."
5,"beautiful, full voices",We saw these kids at Epcot and thoroughly enjoyed their concert. They are extremely talented. The lead singer has an incredibly beautiful voice and the group as a whole is wonderful! We bought the CD immediately!! Paying Epcot (Disney) prices!! I listen to it every day at work!! It keeps my toes taping and makes my day nicer! I hope to see them in concert again soon!!
5,Won't leave my CD player!,"I LOVE THIS CD!!! This band is amazing! I don't know when I have heard so much talent in just one band! The songs are great! Can't wait for the 2nd CD to come out on June 28, 2005!"
5,Bering Strait Rocks Country,"WOW!!! This is by far one of the best purchases I have ever made. This young talented group of musicians is only beginning to scatch the surface of their talent. One listen to this CD and you are hooked. I listen to it everyday...without fail. My kids love it just as much as me. I am going to need to buy a second copy just for them. It is wonderful to see your young children tapping thier toes and learning the words to the Russian song on the album 'Porushka-Paranya'. 'I Could Be Persuaded' pure country...'Bearing Staight' musicianship at its finest, 'Bering Strait they are, right into stardom! They are our Hero's! Everyone should have this CD in their collection."
5,All they are reputed to be....,"This is beautiful music by gifted young people with ambition and talent. They are better at what is essentially American music than most American musicians, and they are Russian. But the end result is, who cares? This is a good album, well worth listening to!"
2,Not What I Expected,"I bought this CD after being seeing them on TV (60 minutes), and being a bluegrass / trad. country fan I bought it. However, they sound very little like they were made out to be in both online reviews and on TV (i.e. bluegrass or old school country). While great musisians, most of the songs sound very similar and ""popish"" - you can't hear any of their great banjo or Dobro in all but one or two of the songs on the CD. I think they could be great, but were trying too hard for the mainstream MTV / CMT crowd on this one."
2,Nothing negative,"like one of the other reviewers I saw this band on 60 minutes this evening. I was a little disapointed with the samples in that the program made them out to be more bluegrassy with a little twang, steel guitar and banjo and all. But this albums samples elude to the same old same old country music that keeps being made. nothing bad, nice voice and music but no mold breaker here."
1,"Interesting, but...","I'm not going to lie. I'm kind of bias with Filipino movies as I rarely see them, but I do also like the few minutes I watched. The description of it geing like the Filipino version of Bill & Ted really fits so far. Why 1 star then? The audio keeps cutting out every few minutes... I am watching this on the brand new Wii U Amazon Instant Video App so don't know if it's because of that or the actual file on Amazon's servers. If it is the Wii U. I'd give it a 4 so far, but remember I'm kind of bias and only watched a several minutes."
2,DIY beware,"I fully appreciate the spirit of ""Doing It Yourself"", but suing your stock broker is not like re-tiling your bathroom. Wading into the waters of customer-broker dispute resolution can be risky for someone not familiar with the specialized legal procedures of arbitration. I would say retaining an attorney experienced in securities arbitration on a contingent fee basis is a better choice for an individual investor."
5,Excellent guide book,Although it's a step by step instruction it works like you are the lawyer. We read this and wrote a letter to our broker. The letter was reviewed and we got 22K in returned for our stock that was lost by unexperienced broker.
3,not that good really,Big fan of Dirty Vegas but the mixes here are pretty forgettable. Even the 2 mixes of Dirty Vegas' songs are uninteresting. A couple of the others songs are outright terrible. It looks like this was a quick cash-in for the band while their other album was on the charts
2,Tel-O-Post Review,"The Tel-O-Post is designed to allow a user to support in a vertical direction a length of from 5 to 8 feet. Unfortunately the item sent to me was minus three component parts (the cap plate, the vertical adjustment bolt and two bolts that tie the two Tel-O-Posts together).Because of these missing items, I have to give the Tel-O-Post a negative rating."
2,wobbly on a carpet,"Unlike the stand for e.g. the Suzuki digital piano, this stand does not have a broader base than the side supports which are the same (narrow) width as the keyboard is deep. This means that if you want to place the stand on a carpet, the piano will wobble back and forth making play impossible. You will then need to construct your own hard floor or supports to make the stand usable.Very expensive for essentially 3 pieces of pressed wood and a couple of screws. If you must have it, try to buy in a package or included with the piano, not separately."
1,I couldn't find any substance in this book!,"This book is one of the worst I've read! Ms. Parker must have an excellent publicist to be a bestselling author. The characters weren't at all believable, and I didn't &quot;care&quot; about any of them throughout the entire book. The story didn't make sense either, it seemed to just ramble and never became believable from any angle. Ms. Parker obviously writes from a formula, and does a poor job. I'm sorry I spent good money on this trash."
5,Fantastic plot,I loved this book. The main character Dan Galindo was so likable that I can't wait for Parker to write another book featuring him. The plot and characters kept me from putting this book down; a real page-turner.
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. Most of the characters are poorly developped. One certainly doesn't feel any of the characters' conflicts. For most of the book there is no mystery, and when it does develop it is unravelled quickly. I found a lot of it predictable also."
1,I wish I could get my $... back,"This book was terrible. The characters are full of emotional and social flaws and it is hard to connect with any of them. Dan Galindo, the lead character, is not the most unlikable, but almost. He can't decide which woman to love but doesn't mind sleeping with them in the meantime and stringing them along. Elaine McHale is supposedly a high power attorney but she is having an affair with a despicable married man. There wasn't one redeeming character in the whole shoddy book. The dialogue was trite, the plot totally useless and predictable. If you enjoy such hackneyed dialogue as this: ""You have no right to tell me to do a damn thing""..... Hooper slammed a fist into his stomach. ""There's my right, ...,"" then this is the book for you."
5,Nice Music,Nice selection of relaxing and thought provoking tunes. I love oriental music and this was a wonderful selection for the price.
3,GOOD BUT CAN DO BETTER,THIS CD ISNT THAT BAD IT HAS SOME NICE TIGHT RIDE OUT SONGS AND WITH GUEST APPERANCES BY KURUPT AND SOAPAFLY REALLY MAKE THE ALBUM STAND OUT HIS FLOW COULD BE BETTER AND SOME OF THE BEATS COULD BUT DONT LET THAT STOP YOU FROM BYIN IT IM A DOG POUND FAN AND SURE I EXPECTED BETTER BUT ITS NOT THAT BAD ITS WORTH BUYIN SOME REALLY GOOD SONGS ON THIS ALBUM BUT ITS NO WHERE NEAR RETALIATION REVENGE AND GET BACK BUT ON THE REAL COP IT ITS WORTH IT
4,Daz Does It Again!!,"This is A good album by Daz If you liked Retailation,Revenge,& Get Back you'll love this new addition to the Daz beat collection he starts off by telling us a little about the gang life in L.A.then starts off with classic Daz beat in What Cha talkin bout most tracks have the same Daz feel to em and wtih people like Kurupt , Mac Shawn, Big Syke, Supafly, The outlaws & the addition of vocals by Lotoya Williams this a gaurenteed keeper. My system has more bass than can be explained and on the grind has a real nice radio beat but daz keeps it hard thourgh the whole album. With the exception of two slow songs for the women it a tight one garounteed to keep the trunk rattlin for a long time."
3,bangin,this cd is bangin some songs are whack but overall it is a good buy.r.a.w. is the best track on the album and daz and kurupt tear it up lyrically plus the beat is bangin.tight cd get this album NOW!!!
3,Super Cuz,RAW is OK but Watts is gonna be running it. Super Cuz is the bomb and I love him so much. I used to go to Lincoln and he went to Carver. I still can't believe your bad tail is on a major release. I always knew you were going to make it big. Damn if you're out there holla boo MsKandiThighs@hotmail.com
1,The reviewers are crazy,"This album is some trash. Just look at the horrible album cover. The beats are sample heavy, overproduced, unimaginative -- NO WONDER NO ONE HAS EVER HEARD OF THIS ALBUM. Save your $... and get a Janet Jackson CD because we all know she is god. LaTeR."
2,Boring and Predictable,This could have been a venture into a mixture of styles instead it is pretty much the same with very little inspiration.
3,A disappointment,"It would seem to be a match made in heaven but it was not to be. These are 2 of my favorite musicians but it really doesn't work.It appears to be Santanas band and Shorter doesn't fit. In his solos he tries too hard to be exciting and the recording engineer does not have him out front, he is overpowered by the electronics and percussion. A JAZZ TIMES review said it shouldn't have come out of the vault but that is abit harsh.If you like Santana you will like this. If you want great Shorter, forget it. And it is not really his fault."
2,no,Not sharp at all - it just mashes the edges down. Might be usable on softwoods but why would you be countersinking in that case?
2,"Okay for wood, not fiberglass.","These are not tool grade! Not very sharp, not precision machined. You can use it for wood in electric drills, but I would not try counter-sinking in fiberglass. As you know, fiberglass holes should be counter sunk to prevent radial cracking. These sinks are not sharp, nor precision enough to be used for this task."
1,Ok but...Expected More,"I received this book, after anxiously waiting to receive what I thought would be a seemingly new treasure of Afro Cuban herbalism. After Lydia Cabrera's EL Monte, there has not really been any good serious books on Afro Cuban herbalism out there...especially in English. I must say despite the effort, I found the book dissapointing for a couple of reasons. 1. The information is extremely sparse and general when it comes to the spiritual use of the Afro Cuban herbs. 2. One or two vague uses of the herbs are given with no information on what parts of the plant is used and how. 3. With such a big book, I was suprised to see so little information on the herbs and no pictures. There was so much white space on the page that I felt bad for the poor trees who were cut down and used for this book. A person who has no knowledge of herbalism would probably have more questions than answers after reading this book. I applaude the authors' efforts but a lot of more work needs to be done."
2,"like the others said, does NOT contain 700 plants, only 257 pages","The description is misleading, the book only has 257 pages, no index, and only plants from A - D, and D is not even complete. I would not recommend the book based on these problems. The content is great, it just needs to be complete."
3,"This book is useful, but...","I have the original edition of this book and I must say that the new edition is a vast improvement. This version has an index, but it does not include the scientific names. Some of the scientific names are misspelled and/or out of date so it can make finding further information tedious. I hope that future editions continue to improve and include pictures and more in depth indexes. Be aware that it is arranged alphabetically by a Spanish name and that the English name listed is not always the one most commonly used."
5,Absolutely practical,Excellent work. I recommend this book to anyone interested in studying herbalism or anyone who works with plants\herbs.
5,Nice size.,This was nice size charm and I would order from rembrandt charms. I wish that The sold silver buy the wight. Was a little high for the wight of charm but it was happy it had a hallmark stamp and jump ring on it.
5,American Beer,"Besure to buy the Special Edition !!! - try their web site. www sixhundred dot comIt has an additional 1 1/2 hours of extras - a must seeI did not buy the Special Edition, and NOW I have two copies of the movie !Great Movie - Watched it 4 times in a week !"
4,excellent handwarmer = Peacock,"I had many handwarmers since the 1960s. The Peacock is the best one ever since it lasts so long on a single charge of fuel. It gets quite hot so the liner is absolutely essential to use with it. Even with the liner I change pockets that holds the Peacock about every 10 minutes.You can use both Zippo and Naphata fuel, but you must be very careful to use fuel with no additives. Finding replacement heat elements could be a problem. Each heat element lasts roughly 2000 hours of heating. Slim size is very useful"
1,stinky,"The capsules have a rancid smell to them. I have had this product in the past and never noticed such a terrible smell. It isn't a smell as you find with some herbal supplements, or vitamin B complex, it is actually a rotten odor. Too bad I bought a couple bottles. I can purchase the same product from my doctor so when I go back to her I will purchase another bottle and see if they have an odor or not. I don't know if I received a bad product, or if this is just the normal smell of the minerals."
1,Poor quality recording - not even worth $10,"I ordered this and listened to the first 1 minute. That was enough. This recording was clearly made using a consumer-grade tape recorder, probably hand-held, probably with with a cheap condenser microphone. I wouldn't be surprised if it was made on a $60 Sony Walkman with the built-in mic, from about 50 feet back in the audience. The signal level is so low that there is significant rumble and hiss. Then a cheap limiter/condenser cuts the fortissimos as soon as they occur. The performance may have been noteworthy, but you'd never know it from this recording. You'd be better off waiting until your neighbor plays a decent recording -- and listening to it through the wall."
1,"99% beautiful pictures, 1% how to","I bought this book to learn how to do inlay. The subtitle for this book ""Design and Technique for Fine Woodworking"" is misleading. Don't get me wrong if you want to look at great inlay work this book is for you. But if by some chance you actually want to learn how to do it yourself don't waste your time or your dollar. I recommend, ""The Art of Wood Inlay"" by George Stevens if you are looking for useful how too information."
5,Written with the touch of a true master who loves his work.,"Robinson's book on the Art of Inlay is terrific and instructive in two aspects. First, the examples of his inlays are beautiful and bound to give the beginning and even advanced students many ideas. Second, the instructive content and presentation are first rate. It is easy to see in Larry's lucid explanations, that he is an excellent teacher who has organized and presented his material in a way to make it easily accessible to students at all levels. While I bought the book to learn how to inlay a guitar fingerboard and peghead, Larry has given me many ideas on other forms of the art of inlay. I strongly recommend this book."
2,not so cute,"My young children love a video called Jingle Bell Baby so much, and I thought this one would be similar. Although this definitely had cute Christmas music. All it showed, and I mean ALL, was baby's faces. There wasn't even anything Christmasy in the background. Pretty much just babies watching bubbles float down. My 24 month old got bored right away. Disappointing."
5,Superb sound quality,"Finally Wilson Pickett music got a great sound treatment. Who did it? A english studio of course. I'd like to know why is so difficult in America to have the engineers working loud and without noise reduction. This is my fourth Pickett compilation cd. Now I can throw the other three in the garbage. When I listened to Mustang Sally, in a crystal clear and loud sound, brought tears in my eyes. THIS IS IT. A MUST HAVE."
5,Music for the Soul!!!!,"What a fantstic compilation of American Folk Music and Negro Spirituals. This is music for the whole family and music that you'll enjoy hour after hour. Pure Americana. You don't need to be familiar with this style of music to enjoy it. Many of the songs here are arranged by John Wesley Work II and John Wesley Work III, pioneers in the arranging and documenting of Negro Spirituals and Folk music."
3,Stinky,"My dog likes them,but.........these treats really smell fishy. Unfortunately I bought 3 bags of these. I will of course use them up, but would not buy the salmon flavor again. I have also purchased the chicken and no problems with those. I love the fact that these are made in the USA. Good quality, just stinky."
3,MONKEYING AROUND WITH SIGN LANGUAGE,"This is an interesting story about several monkeys that are sent to an island to live out the rest of their lives without humans. The thing that is interesting is that, these monkeys have been in language study labs most of their lives and don't know how to live in the wild. But, these monkeys use their sign skills to TALK to each other. It takes all kinds to make the world go 'round. Ironic ending ."
4,what a woman is described here,"A very ambitious story in that it tackles a sticky, sort of unknown time in history - 1700's Florida back when it was a ping-pong game between England and Spain over who ruled the territory. That's not the interesting part though. The best part of this book is the character of Maria, or Mary, once the resident of what is now known as St. Augustine's Oldest House. Maria is an intelligent, resourceful, very beautiful woman who is very far ahead of her time. She comes through tragic loss and grief but somehow (you often wonder how) she is back up again, alive and battering life's doors once more. Read the book to know her if nothing else. A few love stories are intertwined as well. Well worth it. The first Price book I ever read and today I've read nearly all."
2,"Makes a lot of noise, but not much else","I expected more from this toy. It makes a whiring noise, and sounds like the real thing. But it doesn't really blow air. My son was disappointed with it. The goggles are very cheap, and uncomfortable to wear. They left a red ring around my sons eyes."
3,You get what you pay for!!!,Not the most comfortable in the world. The platform for standing and sitting is a little small and I'm not that big. It secured firmly to the tree and was VERY easy to assemble and install by myself. Quickly shipped as well. Just buy a seat pad to take with you when using it.
2,metal flakes in your ice cream,"This product is very sturdy and seems to be well built, but I wound up returning it for a refund. Each time I used it, the gearbox above the ice cream container ground LOTS of metal flakes into my ice cream. I have read reviews of this machine since I returned it that say the same thing. It is a neat looking product that freezes ice cream well, but unless you like to eat chunks of metal with your ice cream, I would find another machine."
2,Quality has slipped,"I have used White Mountain freezers before and was impressed by the top quality material and craftmanship but I was very dissapointed by the freezer this time.The bucket, freezer,dasher and lid were all cheap feeling and looking. It is much lighter weight and not nearly as good a quality as the old ones.I think since Rival bought them out, the quality has dropped to the level of most everything else. It's still usable and will probably last longer than most but for the money you pay, it's not worth it."
3,A Bit Disappointed,"I got this for my husband who has complained about electric ice cream makers for years. He was so excited and couldn't wait to make a batch of ice cream. However, the tub leaks which prevents the ice cream from freezing very hard. I have hesitated to review it because we have not yet tried to get a replacement."
2,Summer Time Fun,"While the ice cream was delicious both times we have made it, the crank is difficult to turn and an adult needs to steady the top in order to have it turn. It was also difficult to find rock salt in the middle of the summer."
5,The Best,"Here's a fun holiday riddle: what is Christmas without Jim and Them? Nothing, Jew. So buy this ish. You'll fall in love with this DVD without the help of racist cupid."
3,Acceptable,"Like others, I bought this to connect a vDac with a Pyrimid power supply. It works fine, but the wires are very thin and not individually insulated. Could be better."
5,perfect,"As stated elsewhere, this is the missing link for the VDac link up with the pyramid power supply - perfect, took me 5 seconds to install and with the pyramid the sounds quality improvements is excellent!"
1,Dynamite Chicken,It was very not anything at all I did not enjoy this one. I am not sure what it was all about.....
4,Salome De Bahia - Cabaret,"Salome De Bahia has been the powerhouse vocalist for several of Bob Sinclar's projects for a while now, and now, with Cabaret, she finally gets a spotlight of her own. I hope it's a wide one, because her voice is oversized and commanding on this album. ""Outro Lugar"" highlights her percussive power, while ""Que Reste-T-Il De Nos Amours?"" puts that power in the service of a love song that sounds, appropriately, like a cabaret song. ""Paulo"" and ""A Cidade Magica"" go for a slower touch. This is a perfect album for when you feel like dressing up and sequins and a feather boa. So what are you waiting for?"
3,Lack of cabling and poor instructions,"These lights are built very robust and have a very large heat sink inside of the housing but this product is losing stars due to the installation instructions and the lack of RED cabling being provided in the kit. The only color of wiring provided is BLACK and the instructions do not inform you which lead from the light is positive or negative. And what is worse is that the instructions require you to tap into you headlights to provide power for the relay but do not inform you which is positive or negative.HELLA, you need to improve on you installation instructions and provide RED cabling along with your BLACK cabling. And if possible, add some insulation covers for the connectors being used to connect to the relay."
1,Tent trailer Cover,"Purchased cover October 2010. Lightweight, fit great. Unfortunately it was shredded by August of 2011. Didn't even last a year. It just disintegrated. I would roll it off the trailer and it would just seperate. I live in Sacramento, but we have not had any 100 degree days. Cover should have lasted longer. If you need a cover for 6 months, good deal. If you want a cover to last more than 6 months, do not buy this cover."
3,Tent Trailer Cover - Classic Accessories,"For the money, this is a nice little cover. It's not waterproof however so we put a tarp over the cover. It's a bit on the thin side and ours already has a slit in it (that we duct-taped from the inside) from the sharp corner of our popup trailer. So far so good although we haven't gone through a winter yet. I bought the 10-12' size one for our 10' trailer and it's almost too big but it does cover the propane tanks well."
5,Brilliant!,Anyone who lives with animals needs this book. Anyone involved with special needs children needs this book. Anyone with a curious bone needs this book. I learned more about autism and animal behavior in the first 20 pages than I did in 25 years of teaching special ed and 46 years with horses and other critters. Temple Grandin has a tremendous talent for making the obscure clear as a bell. Her theories are easily tested at home with fascinating results. Love it!
1,NO stars for this book!!,"What a bunch of high school hallway gossip! The author does not know the difference between white and albino! The 'genetics' discussions on color (which includes people, chickens, horses, and dogs - all of it suspect) and mutts vs. purebred dogs are total claptrap! I confess, I couldn't get past page 87 when the author explains that 'one of the reasons wolves turned into dogs was that nursing human mothers probably adopted orphaned wolf cubs and nursed them at their breasts along with their human babies.' WHAT?? A waste of my hard-earned $. Having read those parts I cannot believe anything that went before or that follows, not that I'm reading any further. How is a multi-published author allowed to put such uneducated 'information' into print? And now she's influenced readers -- a terrible situation. Publisher, where are your pre-publication reviews? Shame on you for allowing this ignorant speculation to be published!!"
3,"Fascinating, but a bit grim","Grandin's incredible insight into the animal mind is fascinating, but her depiction of the plight of animals in our human society (as well as her role in perpetuating that plight) left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Not light reading, but important indeed."
5,Revisiting the human/animal relationship,"I opened this book with the expectation of discovering some secret unknown to the rest of us about animal communication. What I found was even better.This is a lively blend of personal experiences and current animal cognizance studies, written in a candid, subjective, and conversational tone. Because of the subjective approach, mediated by reference to a lot of the scientific literature, I think anyone reading this book will be motivated to reassess their assumptions about animal cognition.Temple Grandin's contribution is all the more valuable in that she is a person who cares about animals but is not speaking in the voice of an activist. Whether you agree or disagree with her opinions, I hope you will try this book and share it with friends. I think it will change your thinking. I hope at the very least it will motivate greater outrage at our current public policy of neglect toward animal rescue."
2,"Interesting, But Can't Recommend It","While I admit this book has fascinating information that I had not seen before, I was distracted by the emphasis on the meat packing industry. That's only logical since one of the authors has spent 30 years working on more humane ways of handling animals. It's not the whole book, but it was almost enough for me to put the book down. In terms of autism, I have to agree with other person who said that they felt she got off the topic. There are just so many times she can say that being autistic, she is more visual than verbal. Ok, I get it. Then she says it a second time, a third time , fourth, .... Better editing would have improved this book."
5,fascinating,"I am a wildlife rehabilitator and do a good deal of reading about animals and their needs/behavior etc. 'Animals in Translation' is the most facinating book on animals that I've ever come across. It includes examples of wildlife as well as domestic and farm animals. It's beautifully written and the author makes very complicated information completely comprehensible to the non scientific person. In her book, Ms Grandin has opened the door to the mysteries of the animal kingdom and in doing so, made us wiser to their plight of living amongst humans. This book has answered many questions and given me a whole new perspective on our furry friends. Anyone who is curious about animals, has a pet or works with animals, should be reading the material written in this book."
4,Interesting,"What an interesting approach... if you want to dive deeper into the issues addressed here I recommend ""Adam's Task: Calling Animals by Name,"" by Vicki Hearne, which combines animal training with philosophy and literary criticism. If you are an animal trainer-- or even just an animal lover-- it's definitely worth checking out."
4,Animals in Translation.,"I'm half way through reading this book and already it is a huge wealth of information. Informative on the subject of all animals. If you know someone who loves animals,this makes a great gift."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I thought this book would help give insight into animal's minds to help with understanding our pets better. It gave some good tips, but they were far and few between. This book focused on issues with animals at meat packing plants...not something I enjoy reading about. I felt like I was reading a school book- too much technical information- not enough down to earth advice/lessons. I hope her 2nd book ""Animals Make us Human"" is better because I bought them both."
5,Interesting and thought provoking book; very readable,"Grandin and Johnson's personal and accessible writing style makes this book the equivalent of sitting down with Grandin for a cup of coffee as she explains some of her thoughts on parallels between animal perception and thinking and autism. This is a personal view, not an academic view, but it is the personal view of someone who is well informed on both topics. Grandin is herself autistic and an animal lover who has been working with animals for entire life. She explains how she comes to those views and offers academic evidence where relevant. I saw broader applications for a number of the points that she makes, especially the tendency of non-autistic people to perceive abstract representations of reality rather than the details that make up reality. I received this book as a present from an evolutionary biologist and have in turn recommended it to others; I look forward to reading more from this author."
5,Animals in Translation,"This book was refered to me by a friend. It gives you a greater understanding of animals, people and autism. I has made me look at things in a different light and has given me a positive look at dog behaviors as well as other animals.I recommend this book to teachers and dog owners especially. I even think it would give teenagers a better understanding of people and animal life."
4,Animals in Translation,"A very enlightening concept of how animals think and how the autistic mind provides insights. Provides a better understanding of the animal, as well as the autistic mind and the role it could play in society."
3,The Meatpacker's Friend,"I bought this book because I am involved in animal rescue, and I hoped it would have insights to help me with my more difficult cases. Unfortunately, I was unable to get through it. There are frequent detailed references to the work the author has done helping slaughterhouses get cattle to behave so that the meatpacking industry can kill more animals more efficiently with less damage to the meat, and hence greater profit. I may have missed it, but I did not see any indication that any of this was really to mitigate the conditions for the benefit of the animals being slaughtered -- it was to benefit the industry. Because my work is in helping animals that have been abandoned or abused by humans, I found this very disagreeable, and so did not finish the book.I do not recommend this book for people who care about animal welfare."
2,Guidelines for the Food Animal Industry,"I love books and documentaries about animals, but this one was a BIG disappointment. It should be subtitled, ""If You're Going to Kill Animals for Food, Here's How to Slaughter Them with as Little Inconvenience to Yourself and Distress to Them as Possible."" I'm not saying that the author's topic isn't worthy. However, the title is misleading. She seems to have limited experience with the behaviors of companion animals or wild animals.I'm uncomfortable with an author who sells her services to the slaughter industry. How can she expose herself to humans killing animals on a regular basis and stay attuned to the thoughts and messages of animals? Perhaps I'm not as evolved as she is, though.I couldn't finish the book, and I'm not about to give my copy to anyone as a ""gift."" It gave me a bad feeling."
2,Inaccuracies regarding canine behavior makes me question less familiar areas.,"Because of errors regarding canine behavior and the amount of anecdotal evidence she provides to prove those inaccurate points, I'm wondering about the accuracy of areas I am less familiar with. There's too many things she states that are out of date and inaccurate regarding canines. The dominent Alpha Wolf model of canine behavior she advocates is based on a badly done study. It's been widely discarded by Animal Ethologists today."
5,Grandin knows!,"This book was a fantastic, amazing read. I learned so much! I was fortunate to have lectures from Dr. Grandin when I was in veterinary school, and I already had the utmost respect for her work. In this book, when she talked about the similarities between the way she saw things and the way the animals saw them, I really GOT IT! It has been of great assistance in how I relate to animals ever since. Thank you, Dr. Grandin. It is my honor to know you."
4,Fascinating description of some animals'brains and of some people's brains,"A very interesting description of how animals think, see the world, react, in parallel or counterpoint how autistic people memorize, think and how different parts of their brain work. Did you know the fear of falling is intensily felt by cattle? What about your fear of falling? There are some repetitions which could have been edited but it is a really fascinating book which also shows how much more we have to discover on animals."
4,Fascinating book,"This is one of the most amazing animal books I have ever read. It has given me a lot to think about, and now I look at my dog (and other animals I see) in a completely new way. Definitely worth reading if you are an animal lover."
2,I was very disappointed....,"Honestly, I thought the book was just plain boring and repetitive. The author's main point, although interesting, seems to me like it would fit into an essay. Also, the particular print of the book that I purchased, has a dog on the cover, I was very much expecting the book to center around dog behavior. Instead, I felt I little duped. Most insight into dog behavior came from previous third person experiments/theories or anedoctal accounts of ""My Friend's dog Fido, one day did this..."" I hardly think that what one dog did can be generalized to the whole dog population. I mean, the author doesn't even have a dog!! I suspect that I, who have had a lifelong history with dogs, have more first hand experience with dog behavior than the author.I don't recommend this book to all the dog lovers out there. Now, if your ""thing"" is cows.... Get this book!"
4,Incredible reading material!,"I'm only partway through this book, but I can already tell you that it is incredible! Ms. Grandin doesn't use complicated words the average reader isn't going to understand and she stays on topic throughout the various chapters so the reader doesn't become confused. I was surprised by some of the things she was revealing about animals' thought patterns, and that's something new for me! It isn't often I come across a book that surprises and amazes me page after page.My only complaint is that Ms. Grandin has a tendency to repeat things too much or talk about them until it's like she's beating a dead horse. But that's a minor thing compared to the valuable material this book contains. I recommend it!"
5,Incredibly fascinating!,"This book is so interesting on so many different levels. It talks about people who are autistic and the way their brains work differently from non-autistic people and it talks about the similarities in the ways that autistic people and animals brains work and process information. Written by an autistic woman who fills the text with lots of first hand experience she really helped me to understand animals on a whole new level. I'm not much of a reader of non-fiction, but this book is so interesting. You'll learn a lot. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in trying something new. Very good and worth the money."
5,Excellent development of important field work.,"This book is technical, but a very important work in reference to understanding not only animals, but work with autism for classroom teachers and parents. As a teacher of young children, I found this invaluable. Do not let the fact that some parts are slow going deter you! This is an important book for anyone working with children or animals in any capacity."
5,Wonderful!,"I had the pleasure of hearing Dr. Grandin speak at a conference not long ago, and I was amazed. She is an incredible person, educator and captivating speaker. Her passion for animals, and devotion to educating others was evident in every word she spoke. I highly recommend her latest book, and consider myself lucky to have heard her speak in person."
4,Fascinating insights on two fronts,"For anyone wishing to better understand the way animals ""see"" the world, this book is a ""must-read"". Those of us interested in perceiving the world through autistic eyes will find this book fascinating as well. I am always humbled & amazed when a person afflicted with autism manages to communicate the experience. Temple Grandin has gone one better by seeing the correlation between the way autistics & animals grasp reality. With the aid of her co-author, she triangulates the points of view of animals, autistics, & ""typical"" humans & hits the bullseye of clarity in her explanations. A rare gem because few, if any, other humans could have written it."
1,Taylor 2702N is a VERY poor rain gauge,"The original 2702N had a 5"" capacity and a rectangular opening. The new version has a 6"" capacity, an oval opening and reads about 30% higher than actual. It also does not look at all like the picture shown on various web sites.It is a piece of crap and Taylor should take it off the market."
5,Not the gauge pictured,"Plenty of reviews before mine pointed out that the picture is not what you get. By the time I looked at it, the first picture is wrong, but the other 3 show the right one. Just in case, I looked it up on the Taylor website, and it is the curved body with the yellow background. Since I mounted it on the fence outside, we've had a few rainstorms, and I am completely happy with it. One thing my wife and I both like is you can get a decent reading from a fairly sharp angle. My 5 star rating is for how it works, not Amazon's pictures."
2,Beware of online description,"You may want to check with the vendor about what exactly you're getting before ordering this gauge: I purchased two because of the metric AND english gradations and the price was right - what I got was an inches-only gauge that did not have nearly the precision advertised. Heck, it wasn't even the same shape or color as pictured!"
5,Heavy Duty rain gauge,"I bought this as a gift, so I didn't actually use it myself. But it seems very durable and easy to read, just what you are looking for in a rain gauge. The price was right and shipping was fast."
3,Not Durable Long Term,"This rain gauge leaked after about a year of service. I am online to buy a new one[a different brand] that will hopefully last longer. It was very inexpensive, so I suppose you get what you pay for."
2,"Seems durable but doesn't collect rain, only bugs","I have owned this for over a month now and we have had multiple heavy rainstorms. When the storms are over, I check the rain gauge and I have never seen water in it, only bees and other bugs that have managed to die in it. Would not recommend this to others as it has been worthless to me. It does seem like durable plastic though."
1,I never get this!!!,"Hi everyone who may read this onceI guess that the voice of the customer is never listen in here, i expected to receive this book but i didnt, i wanted to give it to my father as a gift and i couldnt..it is too sad as I mwntioned before..no one could tell me where was my package and in which company...this is my first buy in amazon and I guess i will not buy again...I NEVER RECEIVED what I bought!!!Thanks for nothing"
4,Shadows Of Power,"This book gets into who and what really runs America. Like it or not banks run America! The key to controlling a nation is to run it's central banks and the goal is for a one world order or government as the author said. This book gets the behind the scene look at the power behind the throne and what went on in American history. A very interesting view on how the media is controled and how the media is bias. This book came out a while ago, but still worth a read."
1,Perloff is a bit of a nut!,"Even though Mr. Perloff says that politicians using the ""communist threat"" is a bunch of BS, he is the consumate anti-communist who thinks that only the John Birch Society can save us! There is some info about the CFR that might be valuable, but it's difficult to know what might really be true and what is his personal opinion.It's OK as an intro to the CFR, but the author is still living in the early fifties."
3,prodoct doesn't match,the prodoct doesn't match what in description. VA is only 60% and Zinc is only 80%.
4,She Won't be Forced to Recant this Book,"Mary Collins has written a critical assessment of the Roman Catholic Church. It's quite personal in style and she does not get into just bashing her former faith. Ironically, she measures what Catholics believe against what one can read in a King James Version of the bible. She finds Catholicism seriously at odds on that standard. She became a believer in Jesus Christ and found that that was all she was searching for as a former nun. (I plan to pass this book to Catholic relatives who are questioning and struggling with what their church is teaching them). Her bibliography includes quite a number of pertinent websites as well as other sources. Her personal web site is: www.NewLifeWithChrist(dot)com. If you are Catholic and feel like you are running on empty with what you believe, this is the book for you. It is ""mapquest"" for any searching Catholic. It can show you the way home!"
3,A Light Weight Album at Best,I was a bit disappointed in this album. With all the star power of these guys I expected something over the top when they performed together; what I got was middle of the road performance material - OK but not great. I'll stick with studio music next time.
2,Could be better,"This is a fair cd. The cd kicks off with Honk If Your Honky Tonk. I had to laugh at what George said before singing Murder on music row that it caused some controversy but he didn't' care. This is the same song he said he recorded as a joke. Strait's vocals are as good as ever and so is his band.He does smoke on Milk Cow Blues and the parts where he sings on All My Ex's but I could have done without Buffets parts on that song . I don't want to even start on what the 3 of them do on Hey Good Lookin. that rumbling is Hank Spinning in is grave.Alan was Alan on his songs and strong as always. He covers the Hank Jr song ""Texas Women"" and The Eagles ""Seven Bridges Road"" in a bluegrass ver. He also did ""Five O'clock Somewhere"" ""Designated Drinker"" and closes with ""Where I come From""The duets with buffet fall flat their voices don't blend well."
4,Three great country boys,"Great to hear george, alan and jimmy in the one performance - excellent quality and great selection of songs."
3,"Fun, but seems like you had to be there","Nice music from a stadium performance. Makes you feel you needed to be there to ""get"" some of it."
3,Multiple stars are good!,I especially like when more than one entertainer participates on the stage or a recording. It always makes it seem more original and not the set patter you usually get. I like all of these artists so the combination is fun.
4,Parrotheads gone Texas!!,"Great bunch of songs from George, Alan, and Jimmy. You won't be disappointed."
3,"Review of ""Live at Texas Stadium""","This is a very enjoyable album and certainly collectible.My only question is since they waited this long to put it out,why didn't they release it as a DVD video? Recommended."
3,Good ole boys do good,"We have really enjoyed this CD and love the songs on it but the only thing that is not top notch is the accoustics in some songs only, but heck, I still enjoy listening to it anyway!"
4,Great party cd,This is a good cd with a lot of variety. Particularly Alan Jackson and Jimmy Buffet were great. Well worth adding to your collection.
3,Party at Texas Stadium,Many of today's live recordings bring the better parts of a studio recording together with the emotions of a live performance ... this is not one of them. Each artist hides his talents well on this CD. Even the normally polished George Strait comes off amateurish. Jimmy Buffett exemplifies the role of the overbearing parrot that serves as his mascot. Do yourself a favor and skip this one for a studio album by any of the three performers.
5,Break out the flip flops and shake the sand from your boots...,I love this cd... the personalities of each of these three entertaining artists shines through each track. You know how every once in while people cross paths and something magical happens? This is one of those times.
5,What about Buffett? Ot Strait?,"C'mon-it's definitly a ""joint effort""! Jimmy Buffett's done alot for folks-that y'all don't know (or obviously care about)It's 1 of the best combo efforts ever done-as far as I'm concerned!"
2,Not the best,"LS at SR is not Leonard's best. After reading Valdez and Hombre, I was disappointed that the dialogue was not as vivid as those two. Characters were a little generic too. In fact, you might call this one a little formulaic. Your typical western justice type novel."
5,outstanding,This book is very enlighting.This is a must have for those who really want to know the what and why.
1,Defective,I needed a battery with an extended run time and I needed it in a hurry. The battery turned out to dead. I wasted my time purchasing this from this web site and instead I found a better deal at Fry's
3,Does the job.,The battery life is reasonably good and does the job.My only gripe would be the loose clanking noise caused by the play between the battery and camera. An easy fix by adding a rubber or foam slit to dampen.
5,works great,I purchased this item as I needed a spare battery to record High School Basketball games and an extension cord is not an option. I tested it to see it's length in my video camera. it ran almost -4- hours of taping before it needed a recharge.
3,Slow to ship,"This battery seems OK, but it was promised next day on the Amazon web page. It was a week before it shipped."
2,Floor model batteries,"I bought this battery for 1/2 of the price, as it was in a floor model camera. But, the life of the battery isn't at all what it should be. The original battery I bought with the camera has much more life to it. So it was dissappointing. I have ordered another one already."
1,"Good for a month, then....","This battery is total trash. After two months, it holds a charge for about 30 minutes then fades to nothing in seconds. Not worth the extra money: you're better off getting two regular batteries and keeping them charged."
5,It does what's expected.,"This replacement battery does exactly what it is made to do; give you extended recording capability over the ridiculously inadequate battery that Cannon ships with their video cameras.As mentioned in previous posts, this battery is roughly twice the size of the original battery, but fits the camera nicely. It also gives MORE than twice the record time. I get between 2 and 3 hours of shooting w/ the LCD open."
4,Amazing battery!!!,I own the Canon HV-20 and this battery is almost twice as large as the stock battery and it fits flush with the camera body. This battery lasts much longer than the stock battery. All you need are a couple of these and you'll be set for a full days recording!!!
1,Guess I got a bad one...,"Like only a couple other users here, I got a bad one. From the packaging, etc - it all looks legit, but this battery dies within 20-30 minutes of work. It really pisses me off, to have spent this much, but I see I'm in the minority here. I guess everyone gets the lemon every now and then."
4,Not the extended use battery for HV30,"Good battery to replace the one that comes with the HV30, but this is not the extended use battery."
4,"Bass Beats and ""why melody? :( ""","This's a great song but I don't like the part when the melody comes. I have to agree with Jason, the songs here in US are [bad]. Here in Tampa they don't like anything but breaks. I let some DJ's hear this song, they said it's not their type. Well if anyone wants some good hard pumping techno songs like this, just email me and I'll tell you the names of the good ones ;)"
5,"Bass, Beats & Melody","Out of all the Brroklyn Bounce singles that have been released in the past so far, none i reckon can beat this single!! For fans of techno, house and trance music, this single says it all. I recommend it a very good buy for not only fans of Brooklyn Bounce, but also fans of full-on house and techno music.!!!"
2,"Superficial, trendy","Easy reading with God in the title and a hook to science. I guess everyone is entitled to an opinion, and if one bothers to write a book, of course one would want it to sell well and get a buzz in the popular press. I confess that I suspect this is another example of an ambitious young person in the humanities needing a gimmick to get exposure. The many references to prestigious people and institutions at the beginning are a good tip-off to this sort of thing. Why spend time reading fluff, when there are so many good books out there? I gave it two stars instead of one because it isn't contentious or offensive in tone."
3,Good selection... sound is just OK,"I love the music selection but the sound is not as clear as I expected. It seems like some of the songs were recorded from live performances, so the quality of the sound is not as good as I expected."
5,A True Old-Reliable,"When I was a teenager my dad sold these freezers in his hardware store. This freezer makes great ice cream and with reasonable care will last at 30 (that's right 30) years. Once in awhile we would order minor small parts for people who had inherited White Mountain freezers from their grandparents. If you don't mind crankin' and doing things a little more slowly, this is the freezer for you."
1,Cheap material made in China,Have owned and used a White Mountain Ice cream maker built in 1975. It is terrific. The current model is advertised to be equal. Don't believe it. New models made after the buyout of White Mountain by Sunbeam are pieces of junk. So sad to see good old timey products being replaced by cheaply built imports.
3,problem with crank,"its a great thing to have with little kids BUT the crank leaks graphite used to lubricate the gears in the crank,its a hassle to fix but it can be done......"
4,White Mt Freezer,"We have been hand cranking home made ice cream on White Mt. Freezers for over 50 years, wearing two of them out. Going to a stainless steel cannister is a good improvement in the design, as we had leakaae in our old ones on the seams, and I hope the new cannister will last many years. We do miss the clear plastic cover of the cannister, which made it fun to watch the process of the freezing."
4,Ice Cream Freezer,The new freezer works fine. Our last one lasted about 35 years and I'm hoping for the same history with this one. It will get a lot of use every summer.
3,"Yikes, making ice cream at home is EXPENSIVE!","And the recipes included are not all that great--and they're poorly written (it appears that someone translated them--badly). Despite the use of heavy, rich igredients (whipping cream, eggs, etc.), the recipes all turned out a little watery, even when instruction were followed closely. This was rather disappointing. An interesting experience--once."
2,His biggest fan!!!,"its like a bio of his music carrer, i found it interesting on some of the stuff that i didn't know.. other than that it's stuff we already know, so im gonna say it's kinda boaring.....***D.KELLS***P.S. HIT ME UP ON MY SPACE AND CHECK OUT MY PAGE DIDCATED TO THE KING OF R&B;!!!"
2,R. Kelly - Pied Piper of R&B (Unauthorized),"It's okay, shows some concert footage from his tour (Chocolate Factory). I would not recommend it."
4,A Great Life,"I read the story of Praying Hyde when I was a teenager. It was inspiring to me then. I recently read of a friend who went to the on-going conference that Hyde was a part of so many years ago. He referenced Hyde and it made me remember the inspiration of my high school days. I love to find old, hardback books on Amazon. I enjoyed the reread. It is an older style of biography popular at the time it was written. I saw it as a nostalgic style, not inappropriate for the time and circumstances. I recommend the book."
5,"Finally ,MINIMAL RAP and NO BOY BANDS","Finally there is a NOW Cd that isn't flooded with rap and boy bands. This CD has all the hits of 2006 on it and is a breakthrough for the NOW CD collection. Instead of rappers and boy bands dominating, solo artists and awesome bands win on this album. Hinder, OK GO, The Pussycat Dolls, and Fergie are just a few of the great on here. BUY IT!"
4,Good mix of music,This is another great CD in the Now series. Contains a good mix of all types of music and artisits.
5,NOW 24 out March 27th no cover or list yet!,"I love now 23 it was awesome way to end the year andNow 24 is out March 27th , 2007 under capitol records!!!! 1 disc 20 tracksby now 40 there should be two CDs I bet! i hope!!!Now 24 will be awesome!!!"
3,Great if you want a mobile desk and looks cool,"I saved for this desk for a long time, and was appalled when it arrived looking like it had already been used. The plastic center tray, and the clear cover over the base were scratched, and the feet were dirty. A word to the wise, don't try to put it together by yourself; it's very hard to balance the legs properly. The keyboard tray lists to one side because the hardware used to attach it to the legs is a little too loose. Hardware-wise, this desk is a near-miss. That said, it's a sturdy support for my imac, and I no longer have to worry about my cats knocking my mac over. It's extremely mobile, and I find the keyboard tray ergonomically comfortable. I like to sit on excercise balls, couches and beds while I use my mac, and this desk is just adjustable enough to suit me very well.Bottom line: very usable, wish the production value was higher. You're paying for more cool than quality."
4,Banks Exhaust for Jeep Wrangler,"I found the quality of the exhaust kit to be excellent and I had it professionally installed. I was not expecting the cabin noise to be quite as loud as it is, but the performance improvements were impressive. Jeeps are not known for their mileage, but with the air and exhaust by Banks, I am averaging 17 in town with the 4.0 and an automatic."
1,BANKS JUNK.,"This Banks exhaust system is a total piece of JUNK. I tried for 6 hours to get this part to fit my 2004 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited, NEVER EVER could get it to bolt on like the web site says. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS Gale Bank's JUNK exhaust system. The welds are horrible on the muffler, I could weld that good and I have never welded anything in my life!"
5,One of the Top 10 Albums of the 1980s,What can I say? This album is a masterpiece. Martin Rushent's work on LOVE AND DANCING serves as the paradigm for great remixes...unheeded since. One of the 10 best albums of the 80s...hands down.
5,best comp DVD you buy this year?,"YES--no question about it. Solid perfs from players you know (Ben Sidran, Georgie Fame) and 2 delightful surprises--Charlie Wood on Hammond B-3 and vocals doing solid blues/ soul jazz stuff and Gege Telesforo doing astounding mouth beats--gotta hear to believe it. Not a minute disappoints."
3,Review,"I bought it for my dissertation. It was okay, not what I was really looking for as it doesn't go into any depth."
3,A Downgrade in One Area,"I'd give the XT a 5 if it weren't for the deletion of one feature the Roady 2 had, and that's the FM Frequency option available with the Roady 2 Home Kit but alas is NOT available on the XT Home Kit. I bought two of the Home Kits and now I can't use them because I use portable radios at work which can't be hooked up with the rca plug which is the ONLY way to listen to it with the home setup! Put the XT in your car-cradle and magically the Frequency option appears, but most times you won't need it because you can hook up the cassete-adapter which is superior sound anyway! The best part about the Roady XT is the way it mounts to the cradle without having to unplug and plug into ports continually which wears them out. But they dropped the ball by deleting the XM to FM frequency feature when you're not in your car."
2,disappointed,"I have purchased two of these over the past 8 months. The first one worked great for about 6 months. All of a sudden, it decided it no longer wanted to turn on. I had liked it up to that point. I did get it to turn on and never turned it off. Well, that was short lived.I made the decision to purchase another one. As I said, I liked it. But after just one week, the same problem started. So I retutned it and got the Inno. Wow, do I love it!"
3,Bought it for my husband,I bougth this as Christmas gift for my husband. My husband made it work through the radio directly instead of using the cassete and cable because it was getting to hot and noisy. Audio quality is not that good.
5,In the car and in the house,"I bought this several weeks ago and it had everything needed to install in the car several different ways. Went to their website and it was up and running in about 15 minutes. Sound is clear and clean on 85% of the channels.The nice thing about this unit, is that you can buy a home kit with a remote and use it at home as well as on the road. The remote works in the home as well as the car. Belkin sells a nice case that holds the xm unit and the remote.The price for both the XM car kit and radio, AND the home kit with the remote cost me under [...]The prices on Amazon were great, on Ebay they may sell it cheaper but then charge way too much for shipping. Amazon gives free shipping.Oh yea, get it soon because you also get a [...]., so the whole deal cost me TEN DOLLARS....go figure."
4,Last of the Egyptian Brass,"This is one of the last of the brass hookahs made in Egypt. This pipe dates back to around 2005-2006. The market trend is a race to the the bottom, lowest prices, quality be damned. The newer Khalil Maamons are made of galvanized steel, deceptively called ""Stainless steel"" by almost all distributors. The rest of the field has been making pipes with galvanized steel for a couple of years. Now, there are non-coated steel pipes being sold out of Egypt...rusto-o-rama. The styling on this pipe is not great, but the workmanship and materials are first rate compared to the rest of the muck coming out of Egypt and China in 2007-2008. Note the one-piece hose port. Excellent, sturdy hose port. The rest of Egypt has switched to flimsy, 2 piece composite hose ports that leak on about half the shanks you look closely at."
3,Nice bag BUT NOT AIRLINE USEABLE,"Some said in their review this would fit in an overhead bin... NO WAY ... Very nice bag with lots of compartments, but be fully aware it is huge..."
4,good backpack but doesn't fit smaller planes,"this backpack is nice, safe for the equipment but does not fit overhead storage in regular smaller planes - went Boston - LA - Kahalui Maui - LA - Minneapolis - Boston - and it fit in one plane in overhead storage! Many problems at the gate but thank God the crew always let me use their storage but imagine they wouldn't and you would have to give someone a thousands of dollars in equipment to check in and hope you will get it back..... SCARY!"
4,Great camera bag,"I love this bag as a rolling bag that will handle both my 35mm cameras with lens attached, plus plenty of room for other lens and flash units. With all my equipment loaded into it, I could not see using it as a backpack. It would be too heavy for me to carry for any lenght of time.So, I cut out the straps that were used for backpack, and that gives me more room for books and brackets, and Etc.I own many bags and I'd say this is the best one I've got. I get more in it than other larger bags, and the rollers make it nice."
3,Aack. More little pieces.,"I'm convinced that toy makers sit in their offices laughing at the angst they put us parents through with these toys that have dozens of small pieces.It took my 4 year old daughter approximately 15 minutes to lose most of the pieces to this.However, Polly Pocket takes the cake for obscenely tiny pieces that you will find scattered for years all over your house. Just yesterday I sat down and found a minuscule Polly shoe on the rug under my foot."
2,not made well,"I bought this toy based on the reviews from other people. It looks really cute in the package, but the accessories are made cheaply. The brushes don't stay in place. The closet rod keeps coming off if you barely bump it. My daughter played with it all of 10 minutes and then was bored because there was so little to do with it. Plus, the hair dryer/sink didn't work very well. The hair dryer kept getting caught. Save your money on this one. On the positive side, the pony is very cute and your kids can use their imagination with the pony all sorts of places."
4,Daughter loves this salon,This was $10 at our local dollar store. My 2 yo daughter received this for Christmas as well as the Celebration Castle. She loves both of them very much. The Salon is nice because it is small & portable. My daugher just stuffs it full of ponies & carries it around with her. A good deal at $10.
2,My daughter was not that excited about this toy!,We bought this toy for my daughter last Christmas and she has really never played with it. It was not made very well and fell apart rather easily. I would not recommend it.
4,A mellow Celtic guitar duet delight,"As a life long classical and fingerstyle guitar fan (oh...if I could only play....), I set a high standard for guitar composition, arrangment and performance to be pleased with a CD. Robin Bullock and Steve Baughman deliver on all fronts.The overall mood of the CD is mellow and soothing. Bullock and Baughman mix excellent fingerstyle technique and Celtic style pull offs / hammers with occassional light strumming to create a gentle journey to a breezy Irish hilltop. Latin elements flavor a number of tunes, e.g. Rumbutan Lady, gently maintaining the relaxing mood and continuity of the overall performance.This is a perfect CD to enjoy watching a sunset with your significant other."
1,Could not finish it.,"This is the first cyberpunk book I have ever attempted to read and I must say that while it contains some interesting concepts, the execution of the storyline is just awful.I read 400+ pages, got within 70 pages of the end and decided that I really didn't care anymore. It was impossible to figure out what was happening, why it was happening and why the characters were responding the way they were.Overall, a mess."
1,Another Couldn't Finish here,"Sex, drugs and poor writing sums it up. Didn't make even 1/4 through before I realized three things:1: I don't like this story or the writing style.2: I have zero interest in what happens with the rest of the story or the characters.3: Life is too short to waste on garbage.I gave it away."
3,Ehh...,"I have to say, this is an alright story, with alright writing, and a pretty good idea. I just dont think im in to this sorta thing. it was too long to keep my interest. it was really only interesting in the fight scenes."
1,So poorly conceived and written I couldn't finish it.,"Author tries to drag traditional detective story plot line 500 years into the future and ends up with a product that is disappointing from a SF or detective story fan perspective. Story is set in a future scenario that includes such fantastic technology as intergalactic space travel, chip based personality transference, etc and yet we're still shooting bullets? Main character is inconsistent and dull. Gratuitous sexual references are clumsy and do little to develop character or plot. Bought the Kindle version of the book based upon favorable reviews of others and will have to be more discriminating in future to avoid such disappointment."
1,"None for me, I'm full.....","Probably one of the most annoying sci-fi writers alive.There ARE some good ideas here but the narrative is so cheese-ball in its attempt at trying to be Mickey Spillane-meets-William Gibson that I couldn't get past the first hundred or so pages. You could almost see Morgan pushing to get the cover blurbs he had in mind (""A new, stylish writer and the heir-apparent of Philip K. Dick and Neal Stephenson!!"").If Morgan could turn down the faux over-the-top style and perhaps team up with another writer who could moderate his Bi-polar tendencies we could be looking at some good sci-fi here."
1,standards are dropping,"I give this book one star and that only because it was late night reading before I was ready to nod off.This is pseudo cyberpunk meets the wild west. It should appeal to the gadget hungry Yugeo set, those who invent plots and tech where and when you get into a corner.Extropians and techies will love it because it has one of every possible idea once we find that we can download the human mind into a chip which is not much more than the portable media we carry on a watch chain today.Oh, yes, move over Bester, we can travel mentally into stored replacas or any other body where the chip has been removed.How does the author extend this story to over 500 pages? He watches the cartoon series shown on afternoon TV.Give Rambo access to James Bond's store of gadgets. Wind him up and turn him loose on some pseudo renegade mission, inventing subplots to keep Rambo on his carnage campaign and you have the story. Don't bother worrying about any substance; just revel in the carnage."
3,Too much of a good thing?,"I enjoyed this book, and am something of a sci-fi snob; I usually stick with P.K. Dick, William Gibson, or Neal Stephenson. If you like those authors, you will probably enjoy Altered Carbon. But at over 500 pages, I found at times my attention wavered. This book could have been a true sci-fi classic if the writer had shaved it down to 300 or so pages. There are many plot digressions that have little impact on the story."
4,great world. so so detective story,"Great world, interesting new concepts which are well fleshed out. I found the plot fairly convoluted. At one point I found it hard to symphazize with the hero - when he goes on a rampage killing any and all employees at the clinic. I liked the writing."
1,Superficial,"""Altered Carbon"" is the story of Takeshi Kovacs, whose mind has been downloaded to Earth and placed in a stranger's body so that he can fulfill the job of figuring out why an uber-rich, centuries old man who knew he couldn't die would kill one of his own bodies. What promises from the reviews to be a complex and intriguing story turns out to be 500+ pages of superficial scenarios that are poorly stringed together. I only bothered to finish the book because I assumed events would come together for a grand finale, but the ending was just as blasé as the rest. The scenes, with their gratuitous weaponry and violence and cartoonish characters, generally read like a graphic novel (no offense to the good graphic novels out there) and the writing is so shallow that I just couldn't care."
3,"500 years in the future and all I get is ""flat screen""?","I've read a few of the other reviews but none of them mention the fact that considering this book is supposed to be set 500 years into the future, the technology certainly has not advanced much. People are still using keyboards, ""flat screens"", and ground cars. The author even refers to Mao and other 20th century phenomena as if it will still be relevant 500 years from now. That is not to mention the level of useless, trivial minutia that lends nothing to the story but fills pages and passes for ""space opera"" today.Even so, the book is not as bad as some of the unreadable garbage I have put down after reading a quarter of the book. Rama II is one of those - pure garbage. It is difficult enough to pick out the sci-fi from the fantasy in the book stores, and then you run into this. I give it a 3."
3,"not bad, but there is better","This is not a bad book, but it just didn't do it for me. I remember firstreading Neuromancer, which has some similarities. Somehow, that bookworked a lot better for me - although it was incoherent at points, thefuturistic technology drove the plot. I felt that Altered Carbon wasnot a very successful mashup of SF and hard boiled detective story.The seams are just too visible here."
4,Good but not perfect,"Morgan gets off to an auspicious start with ""Altered Carbon."" This novel was entertaining enough that I finished it in one cross-country airplane trip. That's no small feat; I'd rather stare at the back of the seat in front of me than finish some of the books I've brough on airplane trips.If you like cyberpunk, you will probably like this. To the extent that it has problems, it perhaps follows the conventions of the genre a bit too closely. Further, there are one or two too many characters, and the crime investigated by the main character is a bit too convoluted. In fairness, I don't care for mysteries, which typically involve the same kind of over-thought and complicated crimes and investigations; if you like mystery novels and SF, you would likely give this five stars and enjoy it quite a bit."
5,Lots of fun,"This book was great; one of the better books I've read in a while. The pace was quick, and the story started off with a bang. I don't think there were any slow moving parts, for me.Other people have mentioned the violence and sex. They didn't bother me at all. The violence added to the excitement of the story.I can't wait to read Morgan's next novel!"
5,WOW....keep on writing Richard!!!,"this book thrilled me, and I read it right after I finished Broken Angels...which goes to show you that this guy is a great writer.his capture of the essence of the 25th C, plus the ever-misty details of the Martians leads me to believe that he knows his craft!!!keep writing Richard...I'm awaiting #3 with great glee!!!Jim"
5,Outstanding Neo-Sci-Fi Noir,Altered Carbon was an amazing first novel for Richard Morgan. This guy has a future! The book is dark and slick. It defintely has a Blade Runner feel to it along with some Matrix and Maltese Falcon (or even China Town)like mystery thrown in for good measure. The hero (Kovaks)can handle himself in a fight (he is enhanced) but is quite witty at the same time. His one liners cracked me up. The technology of sleeving (down loading one's mind through science into another body) is also fascinating and scary. Overall this is a great summer beach book. If you are looking for a good detective novel set in a futuristic Gibson/Blade Runner like society with lots of action and phylosophy concerning the nature of the human soul get Altered Carbon!
4,Good read,"A fun read with some great Sci-fi concepts explored. Not perfect, sometimes a bit hard to follow, but a nice book for airplane trips or a relaxed weekend read...."
5,Great read,"Hard book to set down. Exciting story, great characters and very well told. I will reading more from this author!"
4,great 1st outing.,I went into thus read skeptical after a friend ranted and raved over it all night at a party. He's got questionable taste.He at last got his hooks in when he emphasized how truly the book fit in the noir category as easily as it did sci-fi.Takes some time to get the slang down since it's presented immediately and without context in many cases. But that just builds the atmosphere after one figures it out.Excellent read. I'll be getting the others in this series as well.
3,i've read better,"There are some interesting concepts in this book, as other reviewers have stated, but that wasn't enough to make me enjoy this one. I tend to judge books by how much I want to get back to them when I have to put them down to, say, feed the dogs or go to work. 'Altered Carbon' just wasn't a big enough draw for me to finish it.While I liked the protagonist, i really didn't care at all about the mystery he was hired to solve. I thought the interaction between him and the veteran female cop was clumsy. Morgan's writing style is good, but i was jarred one too many times by being thrust into a scene that took 2 or 3 pages to understand.Morgan shows promise so I will definitely check out his next offering. I'm just totally indifferent to this one."
5,Excellent,"While it's certainly a bit violent, I never felt that the violence was gratuitous. This is a book I can honestly feel good recommending, even though it's edgy and perhaps a little bit more than risque."
4,100 Words or Less,"This is a well-written hard-boiled (and a bit retro, in style) detective novel, which happens to be set in the year 2400 or so. I really enjoyed the way Morgan immerses us into the culture, with references that we don't get, but at the same time still understand. Great plot. Interesting characters. However, one caveat. I'm no prude, but the use of the ""c-word"" was a shock. Every time I ran across it (maybe 10 times, I guess) I was a bit stunned. For those who are offended by explicit sex scenes and that type of vulgarity, skip this."
4,A World-bulding Cyberpunk tale,"Richard K. Morgan is known for his interesting ideas and creative style of writing. In this science-fiction piece in particular he paints a noir like future in a world where man has colonized other worlds and immortality can be attained. Morgan allows us to experience this world through the eyes of Takeshi Kovacs, an ex-ENVOY corps and former gang member. Kovacs is reserved, intelligent and human. He plays along with high-society but also dips into the lower rungs and he certainly is not afraid to use force. There is a variety of strong characters in the novel from Miriam Bancroft to Kristin Ortega. Morgan sculpts a breath-taking and bleak futuristic world where religion is declining and the inhabitants are offered unlimited life whilst crafting a complex yet understandable plot that will leave you wondering if this future truly is good or bad."
4,Altered Carbon,Well paced and cinematic. Just waiting for someone to scoop the rights! See ya on the big screen
2,"Succeeded in some areas, failed miserably in others.","Morgan's novice novel has a lot of excellent ideas with the rockets from the seediest hellholes on Earth, through virtual reality torture, into several gory firefights, and on to some exotic sexual escapades, however, the writing doesn't have the maturity that you expect for this kind of money. Morgan succeeded with some of the essentials attempted, but others were full of potholes. It did become rather dull with some of the details, and needs to be more dedicated to the development of the overall story, then it would be an excellent work, but unfortunately, it doesn't have the maturity it should have."
1,avoid this book,"Based on other good reviews I saw here on Amazon, I made an impulse purchase of this book for my Kindle, since I like science fiction.After reading about 5-6 pages, I realized I had made a mistake in purchasing it.The characterization is buffoonish and weak and the writing is awkward as well.Anways, if you have a Kindle, try to read the sample chapter instead of buying it outright. You will likely save yourself some money."
1,Awful!,"Who edited this garbage mascerading as a book? ""Altered Carbon"" has to be the worst book I've ever read. By the time you are 10 pages in you want to throw the book across the room. By the time you are on page 100 you woner how you can get 2 hours of your life back. This is the only book I've never finished! Don't believe the hype skip this awful book."
3,Seemed like it would be good,"Seemed like it would be a hit, but too much technical jargon. Book should have ended 50 pages earlier then it did. I found myself wondering if the author got more money if he reached 500 pages. The idea of the book is interesting but not fulfilling. Fight scenes are good, but theres not enough of them. Interesting technology. I would not read the follow up to this"
4,A review,"Not a bad neo-cyberpunk story, not high art. Overall I would rate it as good mind candy for when you are in the mood for a reasonably well written story that won't make you think too deeply."
4,Advanced Biotech Detective Novel,"A great book that combines a future of replaceable bodies (""sleeves"") and advanced biotech with a dark `30s style detective novel. The main character is of course a down and out loser with a shady past but superior survival skills. You root for this guy even thought he can't really seem to get it together to really care what happens to himself. The issue of creating tension in a world of personality backups and replaceable clone bodies is handled well. The secondary characters seem incomplete and shadowy but somehow this doesn't detract from the story maybe due to the laid back narrative. Other books by this author would definitely be worth checking out."
4,"Crime, 25th-century style","A fantastic, well-envisioned future of humanity. Crime is ubiquitous and high-tech, with our hero being a man of highly malevolent skills. If you can get past the first three or four words, you'll be hooked. Overall: an excellent, addictive foray into speculative fiction."
4,Like an old-fashioned detective story,"This seemed very much like a Mike Hammer pulp fiction story which takes place in an unusual setting. You've got the same kind of grim metaphors (the rain sluiced down from the low grey clouds like warm spit, etc.), interviewing the suspects, and the sorting out of many obscure clues until the flash of intuition strikes. Meanwhile everyone is out to get our hero, who perseveres through sheer determination and the desire for revenge, and everyone gets their comeuppance at the end. Highly formulaic.But I enjoyed some of the flights of imagination. In one sequence the detective is tortured in virtual reality, but they put him in the body of a woman there because females have more nerve endings or something. Plus he had his period, hehe."
3,"Tiresome, Dark, Plodding","The idea is interesting. The ""sleeve"" concept is scary and intriguing. But the plot plods. At times I struggle. Overall, mediocre."
1,Tedious soporific,"For me the most distinctive feature of this novel is not the gory storytelling referred to by many reviewers, but the relentless detailed description of every scene, every meal, every person and every piece of clothing. These descriptions seem to serve very little purpose and do not advance the plotline at all. I agree with many of the reviewers that the characters lack motivation for many of their actions moving from one pointless action to another, although this does not seem to bother many fans of violent fiction.I rarely fail to finish a book but gave up on this after 44% despite a concerted effort to finish a book that was strongly recommended by so many reviewers! Don't waste your money, especially at this price!Finally I would like to comment on the fact that the earliest reviewers of this book seem to have supplied negative reviews, check the first twenty or so reviews and compare with the later reviews. Odd how it improved as more people read it."
2,Dull cop story dressed up with maybe 2 new ideas,"It is worth prefacing my remarks on this book with this: I am a huge fan of cyberpunk style science fiction. I wrote my MA thesis on Bruce Sterling's and Neal Stephenson's work.Unfortunately, this is really a cop story - not science fiction. The author seems to need to work in cops that are unchanged since 1970's TV, and are always ""one step over the line."" There's an especially dreary passage where there is a discussion of this line stepping over phenomenon. BORING! I got the impression of the author as someone who read _Neuromancer_ and then said, ""I'm going to write my own book. Only it will be different because I'll tell it in the first person...Oh and the people can have different bodies...And I'll play up the cop story. You can't have enough cop stories.""I don't like cop stories. Dull, dull, dull."
1,Really bad Sci FI,"What ever happened to good old fashion SciFi? After reading the reviews I wanted to like this book. I wanted to read a cool novel with new futuristic ideas. This wasn't it. After about 100 pages I couldn't even read it anymore. The writing was poor and disjointed and the story is totally uninteresting. I would never guess that someone could make sci fi this boring and take any kind of wonder out of it. After the main character has sex which is described in graphic details like a 13 year old writing to Penthouse, I pretty much gave up. If you are looking for a better written, more interesting novel on having disposable bodies then read the Kiln People by David Brin instead."
4,An Altered Reading experience!,"Whoa, what a great find this book was! If you like sci-fi on the cutting edge, then this one is for you.It has it all. Sci-fi, mystery, suspence, romance, action and adventure, and much more.A must read."
4,"Good, but sequels are better","I recently picked up all 3 books in the trilogy and listened to them back to back. I found the first one enjoyable, but a little jumbled. Some of the detective work done by Kovac made no sense and several obvious routes of investigation were left unexplored. Often I felt like the Kovac just stumbled onto answers.As set up to the universe and character this book is fantastic. I enjoyed the depth to which the author explored all the various impacts re-sleaving would have upon a civilization. The book was good enough to make me want to listen to both sequels, which I think are more enjoyable books.I recommend getting all 3 books. It's almost necessary to fully understand Kovac's character.Hope to see a fourth book someday."
4,Seizes you by the Buckyballs,"which for those of you who know my work, an other one of my hilarious puns actually featuring altered carbon. Magic.Anyway, it does exactly that, this is an ultra-violent future cop-noir type offering, well written and realised, and with a series of nice plot twists and set pieces. I can actually picture the characters in my head, sadly what ruins it for me is that I picture Kovacs (the ""hero"") as bloody Jason Statham which cannot be a good thing for anyone. Pound to a penny he get the role if they film this one! The plot rattles along at a pleasing pace and the body count is impressive. There is a pleasing amount of backstory and the Envoy Corps surely must be ripe for a spin-off franchise, although the idea is ripped off David Gerrold at least (and I'm sure off many others!). Still, this is an above average crime thriller with plenty to commend it!Oh, and the guy is called Kovacs and he doesnt even have a lollipop, bloody let down that is!"
5,A great science fiction book!,"In the 25th Century, life and death have become controlled and a person can be ""resleeved"" into a new body. This and much more in this combination high-tech/cyberpunk with far-reaching galactic sci-fi make this as intriguing and entertaining a work as ""Foundation"", ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", ""Neuromancer"", ""Snow Crash"", ""Cryptonomicon"", and ""Darkeye: Cyber Hunter"". A definite must-read."
2,Too violent and sadistic,"As another reviewer said, this author is no Gibson (or Heinlein). The graphic sex was over-the-top, but bearable. The violence and torture were unnecessary and distracted the reader from what is a clearly interesting and unique central idea for a sci-fi book. But what the heck is an Envoy? A soldier, a criminal, a freebooter? It's never explained clearly in the first third of the book (as much as I read before being too disgusted with the violence to continue). If you want great SF, read Neuromancer."
2,"I thought to myself, hey pretty colors.",Not only will you get seizures from looking at the cover you will get them from waiting diligently for this story to pick up. I am not going to explain the book because chances are you have already read a summary. If you want to read the book where it should have started (And I don't recommend it) open to page 250. You won't have missed a thing. The only reason I gave it a 2 was because I enjoyed the run of the mill sarcasm. So if you like a strung out story and mediocre sarcasm read on.
3,"Boy, I Really Wanted to Like This Book","So much going for it, and such a cool premise. To me, and this is entirely personal, it needed more editing. The third act went too long, and I lost interest.I'm looking forward to Morgan's other works. Hopefully, this was an isolated issue."
4,Good Dirty SF/Noir-esque Post-Modern Fun ...,"but not a work of genius. I enjoyed it a lot though, if only because I liked saying ""TAK-shi Ko-vach"" to myself everytime the hero comlained about someone mispronouncing his name.I also enjoyed the steampunk frisson that I always get from reading a novel set in the future US in which everyone employs 21st century British locutions.Like I said, lots of fun, although those inclined to nitpick probably won't enjoy quite it as much."
4,Fast Paced From The Start,"If you enjoy a fast-paced, action story you can't go wrong with Altered Carbon. Set in San Francisco400 years into the future, the hero is compelled by an individual of power, money, and great age todiscover his killer. It is an action-murder mystery with enough science fiction to give the storyrelish, but it doesn't leave the reader constantly second guessing the technology: It's a nice balanceof good storytelling and futuristic elements."
4,Exciting Reading,"This story was very fast-paced and exciting, I really enjoyed it. The character reminded me of Philip Marlowe with a little less humor-- lots of integrity, tough, and often in trouble with the law. The idea of downloading your memories into a new body is an interesting concept, providing nice plot twists. Morgan touches briefly on the idea of whether your soul is captured in your memories, but mainly skirts the issue-- there isn't much time for introspection in this story. Definitely a good book, whether you're a sci-fi fan or not."
4,Refreshing tech noir,"Not having known what I was getting myself into when I started Altered Carbon I thought I may have picked up a mid-series book. The action starts up abruptly but clearly walks you through what's going on once the fire dies down.The book walks you through the worlds with assumed knowledge filled in casually which keeps the stream of consciousness flowing in a clean manner. The story is gritty and launches into visceral violence as easily as it informs the readers of the new concept of ""organic damage"".Satisfying read which alludes nicely technological innovation outpacing normal moral quandaries."
4,"High concept, beautiful writing","Wow. I wasn't expecting it to be this good. Morgan had better keep writing! His character is durable; good for a series. The images are powerful and striking and the ideas are thought-provoking, which is what we want out of sci-fi. The concept of re-sleeving into body after body is deep; who are we, really? I'd say one flaw is too much preoccupation with torture (I skipped those parts), though it is consistent with the idea that [ending life] has become illegal. Lots of depth to other concepts: what do we become when we are rich enough to live for centuries? How would that distort our thought-processes? This novel was a page-turner. I want him to write more so I can turn some more pages."
1,Not sunglasses,These are not sunglasses. They have yellow lenses with black stickers at the bottom. Not what I thought I was getting.
3,the funniest thing i've ever seen,"i should have known that any ""___ of steel"" production is going to have godawful aerobics, but this dude dancing away to quite possibly the cheesiest music ever.... i had to stop the tape because i was laughing so hard. homeboy looks RIDICULOUS!!now, once you get to the actual workout, it's decent.it may seem a bit too easy for women, since this part works on lateral flexibility which seems harder for men. it took me a while to like this tape, i still have to fast forward past the aerobics section, it's just too funny. i would recommend the warm up from ""crunch-washboard abs"" over the aerobics part of this tape."
2,Abs of what?,"This is a pretty poor product. Not only is the music so loud that you can hardly hear the man talking, but the workout is entirely too easy for any regular excerciser. This product may be good for those who are just starting to get in shape, but those who have pretty strong cores should brush over this one. I still believe that the original Abs of Steel from '91 is the best and most challenging."
5,The Ultimate Clifford Brown,"This album was my first introduction to Clifford Brown back in 1978. I was so totally blown away by the last track, ""Donna Lee"". I couldn't believe what I was hearing... According to the liner notes, this was apparently Cliffords last performance, hours before his tragic car accident, June 26th, 1956. But, within the past several years, it has been discovered that this was recorded in 1955, a little over a year before Brownies tragic death. Nevertheless, it has always been said about Clifford Brown, that whenever he played, it was like he was playing for the last time. And Charlie Parker once told Clifford, "" I hear what your saying, but I don't believe it."" This is a must have for any Cliffor Brown fan."
4,J Wess Hits it out da park with his debut,"J Wess, operating out of Melbourne australia, has put together a hip hop album debut thats off the chian baby, with beats and hooks that just grab you and refuse to let go. He is a desperatley needed injection into the local hip hop scene here in Australia.Tracks that get the repeat treatment are 2,4,6 and 9, but its a cut that plays all the way through.Get it! You wont regret it"
1,Most disappointing publication of any work I've ever read,"This publication is unacceptably limited in content.1) It does not include any of Rousseau's footnotes, which are critical to a more complete understanding his arguments.2) It does not include the original date of publication.3) It does not include his Dedication to Geneva."
2,Too Many Fat Burner Supplement Ads,"I picked up a copy of Oxygen a year or so ago at the gym and liked it. I recently picked up the most recent one and was disappointed. It seems to have become little more than ads with a few very short 'sound bite' articles. The majority of the ads were for fat burner supplements, which can be very unsafe. I was on page 41 of the mag before I got to any content that wasn't an ad or letters from the editor/publisher/readers. Overall, very little content, and what was there was difficult to find around all the advertisements."
3,not for serious bodybuilders/weight training,"oxygen would be great for beginners,but not for avid bodybuilders or people looking to gain mass.it's like women's health and shape magazine but more focused on weight training,but not in-depth like muscular development.i appreciate oxygen being female-friendly,but it's not for serious female bodybuilders."
2,It's only okay,"There is stuff of value in this magazine and content to motivate. But from looking at most of the women in it, extreme bodybuilding seems to be its aim more then fitness and weight-lifting for the average woman. Honestly, whether or not they actually are, some of the women in it look like steroid cases. Between that and the HUGE number of supplement ads (it's ridiculously and distractingly packed with ads), I do question that better health and fitness is really the goal of the magazine."
1,VERY BAD SERVICE,"Do NOT!! Order from this website! I purchased a subscription for Oxygen magazine on Jan. 30, 2006, and I still have not received the first issue. I am very dissapointed, to say the least!!"
1,Not worth a penny...,"This is the worst magazine I have ever subscribed too. I hated it so much after the first issue that when new ones came, I thru it right in the trash. Here why:1- Ad after ad for dietary supplements (like dexatrim and stacker) which i think cheapins the creditablity of the magazine b/c true health doesnt come from a bottle.2- Many pics of overly built up women (think fitness competitions)...not something the average women can aspire too...and too me, is nasty looking.3-The information that was in it is general information that anyone with common sense already know!My advice to you, AVOID THIS MAGAZINE, unless you like body building or like looking at body builders."
2,"Love the Mag, but Customer Service is none existent!","Even though I love the magazine, there are 2 things that make it not as good. I have tried three different times to reach customer service and both times they have NOT replied. Even through their website. The last one I wrote on December 18th and have still not received any response even though it was a simple subscription question.Secondly, I had to get 2 separate subscriptions to get the Digital AND Print versions. For other magazines, I get the Digital included.So think twice before you subscribe!"
2,Oxygen Magazine Subscription,"I just got my first issue of this magazine that was ordered 7 1/2 weeks ago. There were 2 somewhat interesting articles. One shows a few ways to use an exercise ball. The other shows how to do push-ups with one hand on a small weight to add resistance. Other than that there is page after page of diet pill ads. If you take out the clusters of diet pill ads, there is not much left. Hope the next issue contains less advertising. Would like to see pictures of real women and not those enhanced with obvious breast implants."
4,N ot what I espected,"M pentax FGZ 360 flash is able to do the same thing with out this.. not what I expected, but it dose what it advertise."
5,Using more than 10% of his/her brain for sure!,"This is a great book about mostly North American Roman Catholic Saints who have channeled copius ""miracles"" for desperate people. I found the book very motivational. This is the third or fourth copy I have bought as I have ""loaned"" it out to people who are seeking healing or who are seeking to be spiritual healers themselves.Regards and blessings,"
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED BY THIS CD AFTER FIRST LISTENING TO CHRISTY MOORE'S ""LIVE AT THE POINT"", WHICH I LOVED. I GOT THE FEELING THAT THE CROWD WAS ALSO DISAPPOINTED, AT TIMES CALLING OUT FOR HIM TO PLAY SONGS FROM ""AT THE POINT"". I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS CD, STICK WITH ""AT THE POINT""."
1,SUCTION DOESN'T SUCTION,"When we first got it, it stuck on window well and worked well as it's suppose to. Then suddenly, the suction would nolonger maintain itself on the glass despite applying wetness or not. Now, it's just plain useless. What a waste of money."
1,Lousy product.,"Doesn't stick well to the window, and is awkwardly bulky and small. Totally ineffective in blocking the sun and we had to return it as it wouldn't stick and kept sliding off."
1,DOES NOT STICK,"I BOUGHT THIS AFTER READING THE REVIEWS IN HOPES IT WOULD WORK FOR US AND KEEP THE SUN OUT OF MY DAUGHTER'S FACE. WELL I TRIED EVERYTHING TO KEEP IT ON MY WINDOW BUT GLUE IT!BUT WHAT MAKES IT REALLY BAD IS THAT IT FELL OFF WHILE I WAS DRIVING AND HIT MY BABY GIRL IN THE FACE! I WOULDN'T DARE BUY ANOTHER ONE, AND I ABSOLUTELY DON'T RECOMMEND!"
5,Excelente,"Excelente lectura, recomendada para aquellos que crecimos en latinoamerica y ahora por una razon u otra estamos lejos, queriendo volver y sin saber como. No solo tiene una trama muy entretenida, llena de contenido y critica social y de todos los aspectos que se viven a diario en la vida latinoamericana-me sorprendio lo panamericana que resulta la novela. El lenguaje y las ocurrencias en la vida del personaje principal me recordaron mucho a Cien Anos de Soledad, aunque el estilo es mucho mas sencillo y menos elaborado. A pesar que la novela se desarrolla en un pueblecito de Tabasco, muy bien pudiera llevarse a cabo en cualquier lugar de Latinoamerica."
5,Entertaining quick read...,"Reads like a guy telling a story, not an author writing a book. He doesn't remember all of the details and fills in the blanks sometimes (as he denotes in the epilogue). Clark does a great job of describing how he felt at the time. The story of Swift Eagle captivated me. As the true leader of the unit, his incredible instinct, unwavering courage, and commitment to his men is a great example of a real unknown hero."
5,Awesome Read!,This book is an amazing story of the life of a M-60 gunner in the Veitnam war. Mr. Clark's writing makes you feel as if you are actually there. This book is an action packed story with lots of emotion. It is definatly one of those books that you will want to read over and over!! I highly recommend this book to everyone!
2,Missing something,I was about a third of the way along when I realized what was wrong with this book. You can't accurately write a book about a bunch of 18 year old Marines or any Marines with no profanity. You may not like it but to censor it is not writing true history. I respect that he may not have used profanity himself and was deeply religious but you can't describe a true event of a Marine getting wounded or seeing a buddy killed and him not letting lose with a number of nasty words. I have to class this as a novel and not a bad read.
2,A BOOK IN BAD NEED OF AN EDITOR,"I happened to have been in Vietnam at the time that Clark is writing about. I was with 1st Marines but we often had 5th Marine units operating under our command so I have a pretty good idea of what they were doing. As Clark writes in his book, it was a very busy time in the war and the 5th Marines were in a lot of the fights in I corps. Clark does a good job telling about the fighting at the small unit level with just a bit of fudging. (looking up to see artillery shells just overhead? I don't think so.)This edition added an epilogue to the 2002 edition that renames many of the Marines mentioned in the earlier book and states that some of those earlier characters were actually two individuals. The epilogue left me wondering just how much of the book was factual and how much was good fiction."
4,A Good First-Hand Account written by an M60 Gunner,"Johnnie Clark writes how dangerous it was to be an M60 gunner in Vietnam. When the cry, ""Guns Up,"" was shouted down the line to him...it meant trouble. M60 gunners had a very high casualty rate, because the enemy would concentrate their fire on the most powerful gun to try and slience it. His unit suffered a very high casualty rate. Most of the men he served with, and some were very seasoned bush-soldiers indeed, were gunned down beside him. It's a miracle that Johnnie lived to tell his tale. This book was hard to put down."
5,"An excellent, gut-wrenching look at Marines in Vietnam","I have read GUNS UP! several times and keep returning to it. I have read several accounts of Vietnam, but I keep returning to this one. The way that Mr. Clark is able to take his readers through the gamet of emotions and glories of comradeship felt by Marines in Vietnam makes this book a tribute to the men who fought and died when their country called - whether they believed in the war that they were called upon to fight or not, they were truly ""forever faithful""."
5,Great! the best I have read on a real life story,"This book touched me in a way I cant describe. To read this mans life in the ""bush"" and how he with stood fire from the enemy was awsome. How he stayed alive, how he delt with losses and how he found god in all this ""Hell"". I am a 16 year old kid who has read books from the Civil War to Vietnam. This one is the top. I cant put it down!!"
5,True Look Into The Real Vietnam Marines!!!!,"This was an action packed, emotionally moving story of a group of young men who gave all they had for this country. Having been fed years of bias stories out of Vietnam, it was refreshing to see we had some real heroes!!! This book sheds a big light on the other side of the war. As you read you can't help but feel you are in the jungle with these men. It was so compelling I couldn't put it down. I now have a new appreciation for our Vietnam Vets and I highly recommend everyone read this wonderful book."
5,One Book to Read,"If you are going to read only one book about the infantry in Viet Nam, this is it!!! Mr Clark captures everything but the stink and noise of war on those pages. Hard to put down and impossible to get out of your mind once you finish. Former Viet Nam Marine"
5,Only book I've read through twice,The descriptions of the fire fights are written very well.I can't say it's the best book I've ever read but I'll say it's the best WAR book I've read.
5,Awesome Book!!!,This was a great book!! Hard to put down!! I really enjoyed this book and so do my junior Marines!! After I finsihed the book I put it out for the Marines to read if they choose and 5 of them read it within a month and all said the same thing. That was a great book!!
5,Best Book I've Ever Read.,"Guns Up was exciting, fun, sad, and inspirational. The best book on the subject of Vietnam. You got to know him in this book and his friends. He started writing about times prior to the war so you could meet him first. I have recommended this book to my friends and children and all have thanked me."
5,Now this is a War Yarn to read!,"Johnie Clarks 'Guns Up"" had me laughing out loud, tears roling down my cheeks, virtually the emotional roller coaster of being a former Jarhead and relating to so much of what he put forward in this book. If his memory is foggy, so what? So are most of ours at this stage of the game.You want a read you can't put down, pick this one up!Semper Fi"
1,Do not buy this overpriced peice of juck,"I purchased this as a gift for my father. After about 4 uses the motor went out. The company sent a new motor as it was only a few months old. After about 4 uses with the new motor, it was shot. The company refuses to replace the second motor. I would not recommend purchasing this item."
4,Will Make Decision after More Use,"I purchased two of these ice cream makers and used both almost immediately. The ice cream was excellent! Motors are very loud and definitely should be used outside, which we did. A week later, we used them again, and one of the motors made a terrible noise as if parts were loose inside--so bad that we didn't think it wise to use it. The other one sounded OK (although loud, as I already stated). I contacted ""returns,"" followed their simple instructions, and received a new ice cream maker expeditiously with no charge to me, not even shipping. Have not had the opportunity to try the new one but will do so soon. Since we really are near the end of ice cream making season, I wish I had a longer time for returning."
4,One of the best electric ice cream makers out there,"We have had about three of these over the past 7 years or so, and have found this ice cream maker to be very reliable, but it is a pretty noisy, the only issue we have ever had is the motor tends to wear (the brushes in it will corrode and the teeth on the gears will wear off) after several years of steady use, and is the first part to break down, the wooden side pieces on the paddle work well but after some time of use if you see cracks starting on them it is best to replace them as bacteria can acumulate in it."
3,Not exactly what I expected,"I was expecting a top preformer when I purchase this Ice Cream Freezer. I had to send it back because it was broken upon arrive.....I did not know it of coarse and I mixed up a yummy batch of ice cream and then the freezer would not work, and I lost all of the good indgredients....$23 worth of organic: cream, eggs, nuts, and pudding, marshmallows, chocolate chunks, plus the ice and salt. It was embarrasing as I had invited guests for 'homemade ice cream'. Next I puchased another White Mountain...it has been claimed the best.....I am not sure...the second one has to be returned also, the motor is leaking oil, and the latch on the bucket broke off. :( I was able to make some ice cream with the second machine, and it was good, but a real pain to use, very difficult to get the top on and attached."
1,Do NOT BUY!!,My wife bought this for me as a special gift. Both of our parents had them. It made one batch and I thought it sounded weird. Next time motor didn't work at all. I had an el-cheapo maker for years. This piece of junk didn't make it through the first time.Lock down latch also broke first time as well. Poooorly made. First time I have ever been upset enough to comment on a product.
2,disappointed,I purchased the 6 quart a couple years ago. From other comments sounds like they need to invest in better motors. Mine died after 18 months from motor failure. Nice unit other than that. Bought a cheap unit and still working so trying to decide if I give this unit another try.
1,cessmitty,"rival has taken a fine american product and made it a cheap umuseable, over priced product. the buckets leak, the cans bend from useing a very thin tin to make can. consumers should buy used freezer pre rival if you want a good ice cream freezer"
4,ice cream maker,"I have only used the ice cream maker once, but it seemed to work fine. However, I ended up with very runny, soupy ice cream. That may be due to other factors."
3,Orgin,Purchased and paid more for this product because it was billed as being made in the USA. Motor was made in China. Could have purchased a Chinese model for one-third of the price
5,White Mt Ice Cream Maker,"We received the new ice cream maker last week and soon tried it. Everyone said how good the receipts were so I tried the first traditional vanilla one. It froze quickly and was really delicious. Hubby would have liked a plastic transparent lid, to know when it was done, because the motor did not change sounds. But I do agree with most others that the motor is way too loud. Not all ice cream is made outside."
1,Homosexuality is not inherently problematic,"Homosexuality is only a problem for those who make it a problem. Reparative therapy has been outlawed in Ecuador; it should be outlawed everywhere. If you have a problem with your homosexuality, then just take a vow of chastity and keep it. Don't bother trying to get rid of it. Your relationship with your parents has nothing to do with it. All arguments against homosexuality are ultimately religious in origin; they are moral arguments. The use of medical concepts is merely an attempt to hide the Biblical origins of self-referent homophobia (gay self-rejection). On top of which, of course, is the fact that the therapist is trying to make money out of this."
1,Worthless,"I'm depressed that anybody would want to ""cure"" homomsexuality, nevermind profit from his ""work"". The book reads like stereo intructions, and made me want to throw it across the room."
1,Bull,"I cannot believe that someone wrote this crap. How is that people can't grasp the fact that some people are just homosexuals? We all can't be the same because god made it that way! We are all different because we are individuals. Asuming that we were all born heterosexuals is absurd, and thinking that people need to be deprogramed is just crazy."
4,Proof that change is possible,"Whatever your opinion is off reparative therapy for homosexuals, it is difficult not to admire and emphathize with the struggles of the brave souls presented in this book. In a very frank conversational tone (the words are taken directly from therapy sessions) readers observe the painful struggles of those who chose to leave the gay lifestyle behind. The discussions also present a clear picture of the causes of homosexuality and prove that change is a realistic although difficult goal for those who seek hetrosexuality.One small complaint is that either Dr. Nicolosi or his editors chopped too much out of certain stories. More details in several cases would have been a plus."
5,When music was music.,"Being 60 I sometimes forget what real,artistic music was. I have come through the years listening to the music scene change and my overview is that creativity,voice(of the people)and talent is or has spiraled downward. The Buffalo Springfield lets us hear what real musical talent accomplishes in song writting and musicianship. They were,along with many others of their generation, the beginning of the greatest musical phase of the century. All we get now are corporate teenage warblers and one beat rap ""gangsta's"". The ""Great Society""?"
3,Don't Buy This CD,"Don't you dare buy this CD. For a measly 24 more bucks, you can own all 3 Springfield CDs from Amazon. Nobody ever agrees with all the choices on a best hits album, but if you limit your Springfield collection to Retrospective, you are going to miss, Four Days Gone, The Hour of Not Quite Rain, Special Care, Burned and a bunch more great songs.My less than superlative rating (3 stars) is for what is not on here, rather than what is. No matter what your age, experience or reason for wanting Buffalo Springfield music, this was a special band in a special era, and you do want it all, especially because it's all on 3 albums. Trust Stenchy on this!"
5,The CD rules,I'm 15 years old and the song For What its worth is the best. I love old music like this
3,For What It's Worth...,"I feel I should like this album more than I do, but it doesn't grab me. Still, I can't really say anything that negative about it. I bought this collection to get a CD version of 'Bluebird'. 'For What Its Worth' is also great, but seems to be on almost every 60's collection available. This is a diverse collection of songs, sometimes sounded like CSN, sometimes the Grateful Dead, sometimes the Byrds(when they went country rock), sometimes Neil Young solo. 'Broken Arrow' and 'I Am a Child' are strong Neil Young compositions, but Stills truly shines the most on this collection. Must have for fans of Stills, Young and Messina, good window of their early career. If you are a CSN fan, it would be better to first buy a Hollies(Graham Nash) and Byrds(David Crosby) collection before this one."
4,There is definatly something happening here!,"Buffalo Springfeild doesn't get enough credit as a band. But then again they never did. One thing that is legendary about them is the anti-establishment anthem, For What It's Worth. GREAT SONG. The album gives you several styles to choose from and pull them off with ease."
2,Much too little to enjoy.,Every song on this disc is exceptional. Absolutely necessary to any collection. It just doesn't work in this sequence - and there's too much missing. Splurge and buy the three albums instead. There's too much Springfield you don't hear on this disc. If you can only afford one buy ...AGAIN.
5,It's all good,This came super fast with prime. The jelly beans were packaged in a jelly belly labeled white box so it's authentic. The jelly beans are delicious and fresh just as they should be. This is a great deal. I definitely recommend this product.
2,Beware--Inadequate Packaging,"The Jelly Bellies are great, as is the value. But I was surprised to open the box an dfind that the candy was just poured into the box without being in a plastic bag--just in the cardboard. Doesn't seem especially sanitary."
1,This is NOT a floating frame,"Do you have a piece of art that has a front and a back to it that you want to display? This is NOT the frame to get then. I was expecting two pieces of glass that I could sandwich the art in between but instead this is a normal frame with one piece of glass and a cardboard back. Highly disappointing, especially considering how hard it is to find a true floating frame. This is not it."
5,great frames!,great frames at a great price! Looked everywhere for this size and found very few at a reasonable price. These are perfect. Only downside is that the hangers were not attached to them.
1,DO NOT BUY. Game servers are going offline PERMENANTLY.,This game was amazing. But the company is going out of business or scrapping the game. Either way the servers are scheduled to go offline. DO NOT BUY IT.
2,Don't buy this yet but will be a good game,I got to play the game for several days and had a real good time with it so don't base everything on the demo. This will be a 4 star game for me BUT....never should have been released with as many issues as ppl are having so give it a month or two then buy it. I can't even play it til they fix the bug that wont let me and many others even sign in.
2,dull and monotonous,"This is not even close to Diablo 2. By the time you get to level 10, you have seen all there is to see in terms of graphic tiles (gray or beige), mob models (forgettable), weapon effects (see mob models), and level design (linear city ruins, linear tunnel ruins).I have completed 4 Acts in the game, and they all look and play the same, with the same mobs.As on online game, it is an utter failure. There's no feel of community, in the least. By default the chat window is hidden, so if another players im's you, you won't even see it. The chat window (the entire UI, actually) is huge. The towns are empty; players drop by for a few seconds to vendor drops and take off again.This would be OK as a standalone game, and I'd give it 3 stars in that mode, but only one as a MMORPG. Frankly, I just do not see how they can justify charging $10 a month for this game, which has a fraction of the complexity and content of real MMO's."
1,...a HELL filled with software BUGS!!!!,"DO NOT purchase this software. It is filled with game-crashing, system-stopping bugs. I have a great, fully updated system and it still crashes all the time. If you don't believe me, do a Google search of ""Hellgate London bugs""...you'll find plenty to read.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME! RUN!"
4,Fun and worth the money but not much more.,For the price It's at now around 15$ it is well worth it not only that but the only mmo sort of play it has to is also free wich is basicly the exact same thing as the single player but just online allowing you to form parties with other players. The game has a strong story fun gameplay and interesting combat elements all which add up to make a pretty good game.
2,Let Down,"I had waited months for this game to come out...and when it did I sorta wish it never had. At least then I could remain blissfully ignorant of the quality (or lack there of) of this game. I put about 15 hours into the game hoping it would improve, but the game play was so repetitive and lackluster that I decided enough was enough.I admit the concept was good and the potential was there, but in the end, for me, it was extremely boring. A big waste of $50."
2,Total letdown,"While it does have some things that hint at its origins in terms of the same people who made Diablo 2, it's NOT anywhere near a Diablo caliber game. The gameplay is bland, boring, and a grind. Overall, it has neat graphics, so-so gameplay, and absolutely nothing to make it memorable or interesting. The only thing it had going for it was an association with Diablo/Blizzard, and that is all for naught. Don't buy this game, you can do much much better."
3,Very repetive,"Pros:Graphics = 5/5Gameplay = 5/5Downsides: Buggy, had to restart more than once because my character became trapped in a wall or on a rock. The levels all start to look the same very quickly... The layout of the map may vary slighly, but the room look like the same room you have been wandering through the couple hours. The enemy look good and it is a challenging game.Many compare this to 3D version of Diablo. I think that is fair, like Diablo all the dungeons start to look the same. The monsters only change by variance of colors at times. There is even a reference to Wart in Diablo 2, so the delevopers were obviously influenced by it.I don't play many games... I finish even fewer, I finished this... Bugs and all... It was a painful experience at times, but it was a pretty fun game... And that is really the important part, just buggy games aggravate me... :)"
5,Addictive Treasure Fest,"I enjoy this game immensely. I prefer thin outline backstories because I prefer to role play and fill in the details for myself. This one provided enough of an interesting outline for our guild to have a good role-playing experience. My family and friends play this together and have tremendous fun.With the shader model turned to the highest settings, it runs fine on our newer machines. It does need dumptrucks full of RAM (2-3 GB) and a decent graphics card (nVidia 8600 or better) to get high framerates with all the settings set high."
2,BUGS!,"Dear Flagship Studios,When I buy a game, it is because I want to be able to install it and play it. This seems simple but you must have forgotten because what I've done instead is install it and spend 5 hours trying to figure out why it doesn't work even though my system exceeds minimum requirements.A game should function out of the box. Period. I am in Iraq, so downloading a slew of fix-it patches on a super slow military network is not going to happen. This has proven to be an immensely frustrating experience for me as I was very much looking forward to this game. Next time do a bit more Quality Assurance, mmmkay?"
2,Developer may be shutting down...,"Game works ok since last patch, however news is that the company that wrote the game layed off most of the staff and is looking for new financing. Not a good sign. They are no longer accepting new customer accounts for bonus content, and those who already signed up and were paying are no longer being charged. Just a quick heads up before you buy a game that may not have a server to play on. Save your cash for now until they figure it out!!! 07-28-08."
3,This is for Beginners,I am a huge fan of Diablo so I jumped on this with both feet. The graphics are good but they seem really similar on every level. It is definitely user friendly & easy to master. My problem was how easy it was to get to the final level. I worked with several Avatars & yes it is more difficult with some however if you use the BIG guns fahgetaboutit.
2,Fun but very buggy,"When the game works, it's at its best fun and exciting and at it's worst entertaining. The key phrase is when the game works.This game is littered with bugs. The development team is trying to fix them, but it seems that when they fix one, something else breaks. It's painfully apparent this game was released too early, so if you're considering it my suggestion would be to wait at least until March and check the game's forums to see if there are still major problems."
4,Good game - needs update,"Game is fun to play - very Diablo like. My version has some issues with character getting stuck in some areas forcing restart, and occasionally just aborting with no warning. A second release or update might fix these.Interesting mix of modern (automatic weapons) and ancient (swords and spells)."
3,Flawed,"Overall, the game is not bad, but I think Flagship released it too soon without properly fixing major issues. First, the game is very buggy. I get booted a alot getting a ""network error"" message while my internet connection is good. The game crashes when entering into a zone, like the stations.The setting/location is pretty much the same throughout the game which makes it a little boring. It's either the sewers, underground subway or the city: all randomized and look exactly the same.Do not waste your money subscribing, you can still have as much fun playin on a free account."
2,"Unfinished, buggy, not great. But I have Item Lust","I was very optimistic that the Diablo guys would make a great game. Oh well. I got this game on release day. I have patch .5PROS:Lots of itemsLots of item upgrades availableLots of character combosSome awesome weapon functionsGreat audioGreat ideaCONS:It's unfinished, and rushed to release.Many bugs: Graphical, gameplay, audio. It's not uncommon for you weapons to be invisible, or for your character to keep running or firing uncontrolled.Have to read text-boxes for questsQuest givers are boring. They're so similar, you might as well just get quests from a robotic list.They want to sell you 'subscriber' content.The multiplayer is weak all around. Hard to find friends, games, whatever. You might as well play Single Player.Chat window is weak.Ultimately disappointing. I wish it was better."
1,They kinda went out of business,So I get the game and go to the website to sign up and see a post that basically they were going out of business. So I wait a day or so and they shut down the forums. I returned the game.
2,Only 2 reviews?,"Deleting all of the negative reviews will not save this game. The setting is boring, the game play is ok. I wonder if they managed to fix all of the bugs. But i don't care to find out as i stopped playing it after lvl 20 as every single map looks the same and the game kept randomly crashing."
1,"Shoddy Game, Online going dead Jan 31st '09","This game was plagued by horrible bugs from the get go. Terrible game play, terrible storyline, terrible interface, poor online server support. Then Flagship Studios got into a mess with their finances, and now as of January 31st, 2009, the online servers will be gone. You basically won't be able to play the game online anymore, so it's just the horribly supported single player version. Which kind of destroys the whole point of a multiplayer online game.The few redeeming features of great graphics, a potentially engaging storyline that just falls short, and some unique character classes aren't enough to make up for the utter failure of Flagship to find a focus for this game. It drifts aimlessly otherwise.I unfortunately own a copy of this game, and it is currently in the trash heap."
1,boring as HEll XD,"It got me bored right after I played the first few minutes. Even though I've wasted hours on it, I don't want to continue to play it. One word to describe it is garbage."
2,Disappointing,"This game was developed by the team that brought us Diablo II. Unfortunately, it is a supposed MMO that feels way too much like Diablo II, and not necessarily in a good way. For being an MMO, there is really no reason to group as none of the classes really brings anything useful to other players. There is no healing or buffing that you expect out of an MMO, just mostly a hack and slash game much like Diablo II on Battle.net. The big difference is that this game gets very repetitive and tedious after a short while and just eats away at any enjoyment you may have had early on in the game. There is absolutely nothing new brought into this game and it starts to feel stale. Being an MMO, you would expect there to be added content and continuing development of the various classes, but being a free-to-play MMO, the lack of development shows."
3,In-game advantages for paid subscribers,"They definitely neglect to mention in the Amazon description of this product the details as they are known of its multiplayer mode. They also leave off all mention of this system from their website, hiding their forums behind an account system which you have to have bought the game to access.The game's multiplayer mode is Internet only. It offers two types ofonline accounts, a free and a paid (Elite) account.Apparently, paid accounts recieve real in-game benefits over non-paid accounts. More access to content, more character slots, different equipment, faster transportation, among other things.At least...check out http://hellgate.wikia.com/wiki/Hellgate:_London#Pricing to determine whether this is something you would like before dropping $50 on this."
2,Disappointing ..,"This game is fun, but doesn't live up to the hype and its multiplayer features are lacking (at best). Their subscription model doesn't seem worth it, but the free play isn't bad. Definitely wait and see on this game."
3,"Intriguing, but highly flawed. Not worth full price.","This game has great potential, but does not live up to it. The backstory is confusing, poorly fleshed-out, and can't seem to decide if it is serious or farcical. Gameplay is a great deal of fun at first, but rapidly gets extremely repetitive. In the end I was rushing through it just so as to finish. I will not play it again. It's worth picking up at greatly reduced price just to play for a few hours, but not worth the present-day value."
4,Interesting Combination,"I just bought this game over the weekend and I downloaded all the patches and updates and it runs perfectly fine for me. I'm not sure what all the reviews about the flaws were, with the game crashing and such. Maybe there was a recent patch that fixed most of the problems. The graphics are good. Alot of the creatures are very similar as mentioned. It is very much like a combination of diablo and oblivion with FREE online play. Even online you don't have to team with a bunch of nerdys. You can still play solo at your own pace. It has all the rare, semi rare, legendary, common etc etc drops from creatures and rare monsters. Enjoy the game. I've put about 10 hours into it and online is fun except for the spammers trying to make money off of selling game items."
2,Not finished.,"This game isn't done - it was clearly pushed out the door before it was ready. I had really high hopes for this one, it's got a heck of a pedigree but the developers don't seem to have taken into account how games have evolved since Diablo. It's got a lot of potential but it's at early beta stage - no where near release ready. The mutliplayer elements in particular need a whole lot of work.On the up side the subscription is optional, so pick it up when it's $30 or less, or 6 months from now, whichever comes first - might be worth it by then."
1,Hell isn't very exciting.,"I played the game completely through, and in the end, decided online play was worth a shot. Being an Engineer had many perks, many interesting flying drones to do half the work for me as I mercilessly slew thousands of demons, reminiscent of the good old Diablo 2 days.Something told me I would get more out of the game by logging in to the online server. But for some odd reason, the Hellgate London website would not run from any of my consoles.Hellgate London has no customer support or online play. That is, unless you're a citizen of South Korea. So, if you love Hellgate London any more than I do, move to South Korea and apply for a citizenship.Do not buy this game. Sellers won't dare mention to game has no online support, all for good reason. They want money."
2,Boring. Every map looks the same.,"I never played Diablo much but I know this: Every sewer in this game looks the same. Every building in this game looks the same. Every city area in this game looks the same. That's it. 3 maps, basically. And monster variety? PLEASE. I could count 5 monster-types you'll see 80% of the time. And, this is a huge huge turnoff for this game, there is NO RESPEC. Read. Investigate. Study. Spend hours and hours reading because when you put a skill point somewhere, you ain't never gettin' it back. No way. No how. And so if you screw it up, you'll say 'oh well, trash this character let's reroll! Yeah! Same maps again? Are you kidding me? Hell yeah I wanna do those again!!' Not."
4,Great,"Loved the game, used to play diablo so i was curious about, totally worth what i payed for, not so much on replayabilty and you can;t play with friends so that's a downer, if you can't wait until diablo 3 to come out then i suggest you play titan quest to ease your RPG needs."
1,Just not that fun,The levels are boring.The monsters are repetitive.The boss battles are a joke and not hard or memorable. I couldn't even tell you what the names to the main bosses for each act were.Play the demo first so you know how bad the game is!
2,Were they serious?,"I bought the game from target a week or so after it came out. And haven't touched it in maybe 7 months. Given that take this review with a grain of salt.The game out of the package can only be described by one phrase. Not complete. I have heard there have been large patches and updates. I don't want to go too much into the details of the game upon release because it was so long ago, I just want to say. Try before you buy. Find a friend that has it and try it out, it has the potential for a great game but when i played it out of the box, it just was not there yet."
2,Very reminiscent of games from seven years ago,"I will confess that I did not play the full game, but instead played only about forty minutes of the free demo. I found it to be a little ""primitive"" actually, and some of the graphics looked every bit of nine years old. The gameplay had some silly contrivances, like putting a ""headstone"" down where you ""die"" each time. A much better game where you're gang-rushed by enemies and have to use all your twitch-gamer reflexes is the first Painkiller.With so many other spectacular new games coming out now, like Call of Duty 4 and Crysis, I just can't see spending money or time on a game like Hellgate: London. Truly, it's not to be seriously considered to be in the same league with the others in any way I can think of."
1,"If you played Oblivion, this will seem like a 2002 game",Circa 2002 graphics and character models that look nothing like the quality in the cut-scene movies (think Unreal2); you can only configure a few of the controls; no voice acting on most dialog (you read and flip pages); boring linear levels that are not even atmospheric or spooky in 3rd person; lame AI. I guess if you like fiddling with complicated character attributes and inventory this might be for you. This will be in the clearance $19.99 bin in about 2 months.
1,Dont waste your money!! Play the demo first!,"I was excited about this game until I played the demo. The graphics are good but overall game play is boring. Those of you that love Diablo 2 you will find this game lacking the intensity. Overall don't waste your money, or try looking at Call of Duty 4 demo or TimeShift Demo. Those games are better FPS."
1,"It was entertaining, but buggy as hell...","Grabbed 2 copies for my wife and I on release day a year ago. We tried playing for about a month. The party functions were just horrible, most of the time we would both jump into the same zone only to not be able to see eachother. Atleast 2-3 bugs found a night with casual play.It might have been entertaining as a single player, but not for the $50 I paid for it.Now that they are shutting down the servers (which is true, I got the announcement from them), it's more of a fancy coaster if anything. You won't be able to download the patches and the single player game will be horrible without them."
4,Fun game with minor flaws.,"Seriously, is there a perfect game out on the market? Everything has some sort of drawback, but that shouldn't stop people from buying this game. The demo is nothing like the actual game itself. It's like playing the first level in Diablo II and making all of your assumptions about the game off of that. Doesn't sound right does it?The game does offer some very unique character classes (6). I have only played the Engineer, but so far, the game is very entertaining and in depth. Due to the fact that I am only a level 7, I haven't seen all that there is to be seen, but so far, I like what's happening. The armor, weapons, and monsters keep getting cooler and more exciting as I go on.Obviously this game isn't going to suit everyone, but if you are into RPG's with a little flavor of a FPS (really cool option for using ranged weapons) this game is definitely worth the try."
2,Buyer Beware,"Just to give potential buyer's a head's up, Flagship Studios gave pink slips to its entire development team and this game is now in a state of flux. The servers are still up as of 16 Jul 08, but continuing content updates are now unknown. Might want to save your money until this situation resolves itself."
3,A VERY UNDER-RATED GAME IN MY OPINION,"I'm not gonna write some long-winded revw on how great this game is - I went into this with NO expectations whatsoever and ended up really liking this game - it wasn't too hard and i spent a week or 2 playing it and becoming very involved and interested in it. and that was on single player, so i can't even imagine how good it would be on multi-player. anyways no way does it deserve a 1, 2, or 5 maybe a 3 or 4 but since i had to give it a grade i would say 3.5 as i experienced no bugs whatsoever. come-on now this is at least as good a game as the witcher (which i felt was kinda boring and repetitive after a while) or crysis (over=rated)."
5,Excellent Game,"This is an excellent action/RPG game. Graphics, game-play, and controls are very nice. I am running this on an older XP and all is well. Very fun and recommended."
2,1950's Hollywood Mess,"The Godfather got Sinatra the part of Maggio, but I think the producer was right; Sinatra stinks in that part. Talk about over acting; Sinatra has no subtlety at all. Now Lancaster is terrific, a soldier's soldier and Deborah Kerr slips into the part of a lonely wife of a louse effortlessly. The script of the James Jones book is a mess. The Lancaster-Kerr romance works almost, but the Cliff-Donna Reed love story is hurried and unbelievable. She's a dance hostess my a**. The mores of the 1950's did this interesting story wrong. These people are seething with sexuality, but somehow, Hollywood squeezed the juice out of em."
2,"Dated, overly sudsy Best Picture winner","The Bottom Line:Somehow adapted from a novel which was considered rather anti-establishment, From Here to Eternity is a hopelessly-square movie, with lifeless performances by its leads, an overabundance of melodramatic moments and sequences, and a concluding sequence involving the Pearl Harbor attack which feels ridiculously tacked-on; half a century this film may have been deemed 1953's best film, but time has not been kind to it.2/4"
1,Classic Film - Poor Release,"Why go to all the trouble of releasing a great classic filim, without providing it in Widescreen format????? There is no reason anyone should purchase this DVD, if you already own a good quality VHS edition. The ""extra materials"" are not worth the price, if you don't get the complete movie!!!!! I refuse to purchase any film on DVD that is not provided in Widescreen format."
3,How Hollywood picks our pockets....,"There is no reason for re-releasing this Hollywood masterpiece on DVD in the clipped aspect ratio, except as an attempt to make as much money as possible off of those who are even more eager than I am to own this terrific motion picture on DVD.As much as I have been waiting for this release, I will not spend a nickel an ANY DVD of a classic movie that is missing scenes or sides of the frame.Neither should you. That is a message these companies WILL understand."
2,Test of time...,"The trouble here is the test of time.... Of course this movie is great, otherwise it would not have won 8 Oscars.But to watch it nowadays is.... strange. The acting is not up to today's standards. Chaplin's movies got older much better than FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, for example.I watched it again yesterday and I liked it, but I came nowhere close to such excitement."
1,Don't watch this movie until you read the book!,"This movie does a complete injustice to the book and even maligns it. The book is indescribable and must be read. However, the movie throws it completely out of whack. The characters of the novel should not have been played by big name Hollywood actors of the era. It's not their fault, but they just don't fit the characters right. Also, the movie comes of as a typical old romance movie. All though there are important elements of romance in the book, there are more important messages about humanity. It took me two days to watch the movie because I couldn't watch it without getting entirely frustrated. Read the book first."
3,Clift's method acting bears caution,"In the fight scene between him and Borgnine in the alley did they use real switchblades? Method actors insist on doing the real thing so much while making movies it's hard to say. If it did the scene the scene takes on a real life significance in a bad way. Also, did Clift really dig that hole himself that his Pruitt character is forced to dig as punishment? And what about Clift's violent fight scene with John Dennis? The real thing again? If so boy are most method actors crazy.As for the rest of the film well it is believable enough. Some vagueness here and there. Is that really his captain/her husbandLancaster sees coming while him and Kerr are listening to the excellent Hawaiin band? We aren't sure. It could just be a guy that looks like her husband. I love Donna Reed especially in this movie. Her dance hall girl character is sexy and appealing. I love the Pearl Harbor attack. Very believable in the way it is handled. Lancaster is brilliant to watch as always."
5,From Here to Eternity,"""Eternity"" virtually swept the 1953 Oscars, and no wonder. It's a multi-layered human drama set within the larger canvas of World War II. The all-star cast is uniformly excellent. Indeed, Sinatra's Oscar-winning turn as Maggio single-handedly revived his sagging career. And the torrid (for the time) beach scene with Lancaster and Kerr remains one of cinema's most indelible images. Watch for that culminating Pearl Harbor attack sequence."
3,4:3 format,"Disappointed the format was 4:3 had hoped for 16:9 or better.Play was paused several times during play.(These worthless words make the review ""long enough"")."
5,From Here to the Eternity a true classic,"When some years back I saw this film there was no Pear Harbor like today, neither it was in color. But quality of the score, the acting and the actors made it a truly unforgetable film to enjoy. It envisions and shows the things that makes America what it is, and has always been, a great nation that does not give up when tested thru the fire, like in World War II. It is good to go down to the memory lane of filmaking, and remeber the patriots that made this nation what it is today; and with their past strenght will face the new dangers our democracy faces today. We can not let the old generation down like they did not do to their old generation in the past. May God help us all like he did in world war II."
1,from here to eternity,"very un-happy the movie arrived on time,however,the movie was in SPANISH!!!!!!!!!!!my son and his family just got around to watch it and called and wonder if this was a joke? i l wanted them to see one of my favorite movies.waste of my money!"
4,Good book.,"It's a great bedtime story. The art is fantastic and the story has enough to make it worth a regular re-read. I recommend buying this one instead of borrowing, as we re-read regularly."
2,A little disturbing,"I got this for my son, he loves books and dinosaurs so I figured it would be perfect. Here's the thing, in the plot there is a rich family (fine) who goes on vacation and brings back a dinosaur (also fine), but the disturbing part is 1) the family has a servant. There is no apparent purpose for the servant other than to stand around, but it bugs me and 2) the ""bad guy"" is the mayor's wife. It doesn't really make sense why she hates the dinosaur or why the police go along with her wishes and make him leave. Or why he shows up on the town baseball team and is all of a sudden welcome back.So, cute drawings, bad story. I wish the plots of these children's books were easier to preview."
5,Very good book for any student/instructor,This book helps with the fundamentals of Olympic sparring and gives the student or instructor a clear understanding of how to apply the basics. A lot of good combinations. Maybe not the book for someone who does not work out in a Dojahng. You do need to know something about Taekwondo.
5,Instructing Book for TKD Players,"I am a Japanese student. In Japan, there are few Japanese books of WTF taekwondo, so people uses English TKD books to learn taekwondo. And this book is one of the most popular TKD books in Japan. This fact would represent value of the book.As for me, this book is felt to be very useful,too. It helped me constructing training menus and sparring strategies. It contains lots of helpful instructions."
2,Didnt like it,I didnt like this book and it was very boring. Its said the same things many times and the only thing I found useful were the moves that it showed. If this is the best book of TKD sparring I wonder what kind of books the others are.
1,Why...why was this book written???,"I read about 8 books a month, all different genres and have done this for most of my life. As a voracious reader I have tastes that range from the sublime to the ridiculous, but this book fit in none of those categories. It was not ""An American Psycho"" which of course depicted an amusing protagonist with 'an axe to grind'a cultural icon necessary for the books purpose. I am intimately familiar with Irish sensibility and this represented none of it. Your man in this book was a non character and not amusing in the least, to follow this dullard's progress through the book was probably the worst fate he dealt."
1,I must be alergic,"I cannot really review this product because within days of starting it I broke out in hives, and as soon as I quit taking it they went away. I can only conclude that I am alergic to the product. Becase I have no real data, I had to give this one star."
3,the capsules are too large,The theory of this compound working as they claim is pretty good. I can't know since I can't take them. I do not see why 600mg of active ingredient should take up so much space. I'd rather take 6 smaller caps than 3 that I have to cough out of my throat.
2,jury is still out,I used 2 bottles and cannot tell any major difference . I had read elsewhere that this product doesn't go well with zinc and I did not know this before I purchased and used it. I do not think I will buy this again.
4,Jarrow formula,Arrived very quick! Happy with my order so far thank you! I hope to continue to enjoy this product it's been good so far
3,Unsure,I'm worried it's too soon to evaluate the effectiveness of this product since it usually takes at least two full months for any type of supplement to have impact. Having said that I've been taking two per day for the last 30 days (They recommend taking one to three a day.) and I've definitely noticed an upsurge in hunger though that wasn't exactly what I was hoping for. I was excited about the claims that L-Carnosine would up your metabolism. I suppose the hunger would account for that. The problem is that obviously makes me want to eat more. The anti-oxidant component is harder to assess. That would definitely take more than 30 days to take effect. I live in hope though and will continue to take this supplement.
3,I haven't Noticed Anything!,"I've taking Jarrow L-Carnosine one Capsul every day for the Past Five Months, since June of 2012 and I have noticed nothing. On the Bottle Directions says to take One to Three Capsules Daily, so I am following the Directions, but noticed Nothing. L- Carnosine Supports Cellular Rejuvenation, However, I don't see of any Changes, hopefully it's taking place in the inside first. The Capsules are a little big but easy to swallow, As Soonest I finish what I have left which is another month, I will not take them any more and see if there is any changes! Thank You"
4,Smallville Musical Wonders,"The second volume of hits added to the Smallville soundtrack is quite a delight!Whether you like the smooth rhythm of Depeche Mode rendering ""Precious"", the deeply romantic ""You and Me"" from Lifehouse, the bouncing fun of The All-American Rejects in ""Dirty Little Secret"" or the soulful ""Hungry Heart"" from Minnie Driver, this soundtrack has it all and more!Don't miss it!"
2,Metropolis Mix,"I loved the Talon Mix (Smallville Vol One), so I thought this would be another great CD. I was disappointed. It has about 4 songs that are good. But everything else is pretty dull. There's tons of great music throughout the seasons of Smallville. Hopefully the next Volume will be better."
4,missing songs,i bought this for my wife and she wanted it because of one particular song and it wasnt even on there. it was the song from where clark quit playing football and he walks into the stadium and they play this song. she was very dissapointed.
2,Smallville CD,Shipped quickly. But was charged for overnight service even though I asked for standard.
3,Good but not awesome,Somewhat disappointing compared to the Talon Mix. Covering the last few seasons of Smallville we get a few good songs like Precious by Depeche Mode and Forget It by Breaking Benjamin. There's about 4 or 5 good songs here so I guess it's worth picking up.
4,Great songs from a great show,"I bought this disc after reading other reviews and as most people said, it is a fine disc. An eclectic mix of musical styles and a well produced CD."
2,Probably not worth your time or money.,"This isn't a delve into _why_ people believe weird things. Nor does is present a case against believing these weird things. The only thing it does seems to say is, ""I believe this, so you should too.""At one point, I was tempted to believe in Creationism simply because if the case against it is _this weak_, then there really isn't any case against it.I doubt you'll be convinced of anything by this, but it does present some interesting possibilities about how people fake things. Unfortunately, in the time it takes this book to arrive, there will probably be a TV special on that says the same things."
2,I beg to differ.,"""People seem to have expected either 1) an in depth scientific or sociological explication of 'why' people believe certain phenomenon; or 2) an academic paper, complete with lengthy citation, thesis statement, and that `in-your-face' style that one can only find in a paper in the CV of a PhD. Ladies and Gentlemen, you cannot do either of the above in 300 pages.""Really? A copy of my dissertation was deposited in a basement room of the university library. When I went to visit it there, I thumbed through a fair number of fellow inmates. I don't recall even one approaching, let alone exceeding, three hundred pages. (Mine had two hundred pages; some had as few as thirty.) Scholarly papers published in academic journals are of course, as a rule, much shorter than dissertations.In any case, some of us were hoping for something a bit less off-the-cuff, a bit less slaphappy, not necessarily ""scholarly"". That's all."
2,Good start but disappointing finish,"Shermer's book began well, but he devoted far too much (almost half) of the book debunking Holocaust deniers and Creationists. It read more like a personal vendetta against groups and even individuals he didn't like rather than a scienific or psychological explaination as to what motivates people to unconventional beliefs. Shermer seems to have a major problem with God and people who believe in God, which obscures the points he tries to make. It was well-written and a good read on a trip, but didn't really answer the question posed by the title. Overall somewhat unsatisfying."
4,Good book. His emphasis on subject matter was questionable.,"The book was well written and easy to read. There were a few leaps of logic which can probably be explained by editorial discretion, that is, in order to keep the book to a preconceived length, some sections were a little short. the book spent an inordinate amount of time on debunking the holocaust deniers while other interesting sections WAY too short. For example, the chapter on Frank Tippler's 'the Physics of Immortality' could have been expounded on. It almost seemed as if Shermer likes Tipplers theory. He could have spent more space asking the question, ""is it sound physics, or just physics that sounds good?"" All told though, Why People Believe Weird Things is worth the time to read."
4,Not for TRUE BELIEVERS!,"Great book. Interesting, fast read with personal anecdotes. Funny in numerous places. Contains a good, simple yet workable definition of SCIENCE. Worthy to be read by honest, decent folk not held in the clutches of crazy religious, political, or creationist pap. Nonetheless, Shermer's simplistic denial of synchronicity was utterly disappointing. It would be great if scientists would simply state ... just once ... that some activities and some phenomena are simply beyond the realm of our current scientific understanding! Some things cannot be measured with today's scientific tools ... but someday they probably will be. Let's not become TRUE BELIEVERS ourselves."
1,debunkers are losers!,"debunkers are loserswhats the difference between debunkers and Christian fundamentalist..there isn't one there!there both cults!there is an esoteric side to life that the scientist don't know much about..I have had experience with ESP,OBE and helped make 2 documentary's on UFO phenomena.The reason people believe in strange things is because TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN FICTION!I have no time for sceptic debunkersOBTW it's possible to get 3 pairs dice correct in a row! Because I have done it (without conscious effort) ""small inner voice""..it comes to when NOT thinking about it.all I can say to debunkers..is get real..it's DIRECT EXPERIENCE!..positive people know the truth!I feel sorry for debunkers.."
2,"Some interesting content, but incoherent and mistitled.","This book would be better titled, ""Some Weird Things People Believe and Why I Think They're Wrong.""Several times I came away from sections feeling the case for the critiqued belief system was stronger than I did going in. Shermer seems to make a lot of the same flawed arguments against the ""weirdos"" that he criticizes them for using.There's interesting stuff in here, but it isn't stitched together in any kind of coherent way, and there are no great insights to be had. Save your time and money."
2,Why people believe in weird things,A drawn out jumble of words needing the dictionary taking too long to get to a point. Not recommended for the casual read or reading for relaxation.
5,"Hilarious, fascinating, & informative","Nearly (but not quite) as good as HOW WE BELIEVE, Shermer's WHY PEOPLE BELIEVE WEIRD THINGS is a delight to read. Though targeted primarily at the general public, it should appeal to scholars as well. A must read for any thinking person.ALSO RECOMMENDED: Shermer's HOW WE BELIEVE: THE SEARCH FOR GOD IN AN AGE OF SCIENCE."
2,Strange,"Whe I got the book I recived it fairly quick, but there was a sticker on the front and back, and the book did not match the picture on the order page."
3,Elementary yet original,"Shermer's primer on skepticism has little to teach someone who's subscribed to the Skeptical Inquirer for more than a few months, but for beginners it would likely be an engaging and nonthreatening read. Even for dyed-in-the-wool cynics, Shermer's choice of examples for types of mental fallacy make the book worth reading. His real life experiences with health faddism are amusingly retold and give him credibility, while his controversial selection of Objectivism as an example of a cult is both original and an additional proof of his own (so to speak) objectivity. Many skeptics have attempted the definitive popularization of their philosophy -- so far, of those I've seen, Shermer has come closest to creating it."
4,"Overall, it was a worthwhile read.","Mr. Shermer has created a good book that delves into the heart of a phenomena of, basically, why people believe weird things. He, overall, takes the calm, reasonable approach of knocking down many outlandish theories rather than dismissing the ideas out of hand. This is the only way to bring forth truth and send back into darkness ingorance. The book's main flaw is Mr. Shermer's unwillingness to admit the problems that exist in evolutionary theory. These are merely glossed over and he surely knows better than to do that. Also he falls into the fallacy of dismissing all UFO sightings and encounters as being delusions even after he states Carl Sagan (a man he obviously admires) believed that the universe was teeming with life. Overall, though, it was a good read."
3,Wasn't Anything I Hadn't Read,"This book started with some scientific rational for why we tend to believe weird things. The chapters on ESP, alien abduction and supernatural phenomenon were fun, but the book takes a more serious turn. Shermer goes after Christian Fundamentalists and creationism. I have no problem with his position and agree with him, but he doesn't add any real insight. Finally, he goes after Holocaust deniers. Again, I have no problem with his argument or explanation, it simply wasn't anything I hadn't read - not as much fun as the first part."
2,weird things that people believe,"I did not read this book cover to cover. I skimmed through it and read the parts on Ayn Rand, Creationism vs. Evolution and the Conclusion. From what I could glean, this book does little to explain why people believe weird things. It talks a lot about weird things that people do believe, but that makes the title very misleading. Who are these people that believe weird things? Does a small group of people believe a lot of weird things? The author never delves into these questions. When reading the sections on Creationism and Holocaust Denighers, I had to put the book down as I could not bear to waste my time on the people in question."
2,Shermer incorrect about creationism,"I have perused this book in the bookstore, though not actually bought it and read it; so that's my upfront disclaimer.I like some of the things Shermer says, the way he categorizes common errors in critical thinking. What he doesn't seem to realize is that his arguments regarding creationism commit these same errors."
2,I didn't like this book.,"I have read widely in mass hysteria, hypnosis, persuasionand similar topics and this book ( I bought it for a GF whothought herself the super SKEPTIC!) this book was a dissapointmentto me intellectually and in practical examples as i recall. I either gaveit away or threw it in the round file."
3,"Less ""Why"" and more ""What"" people believe","If you, like me, are really interested in why people believe weird things, don't buy this book, I'll just tell you. People believe weird things because they want to believe them. It's as simple as that.If, on the other hand, you want to read about various weird beliefs and hear them debunked, then this is the right book. It is basically a collection of Michael Shermer's columns from Skeptic Magazine.Only a few pages are dedicated to the psychology behind people's belief systems and how they go astray. This was my reason for buying the book. Instead I got chapters on UFOs, holocaust denial, ESP, creationism, etc and why these beliefs are flawed. But I never believed in them, so I don't need them debunked. I wanted to know why anyone else would believe them. This is where the book fails to deliver."
3,"A good, but not complete introduction","I would have preferred that Shermer spend less time on evolution and Holocaust denial and more on newer fads like feng shui. Resistance to evolution is a special case, being mostly religiously-based and as far as Holocaust denial goes, we know what sort of people deny the Holocaust.The book is more readable than Shick's similarly-titled ""How To Think About Weird Things"" but not as well-organized."
1,Not worth it.,"How is the paperback $1 and the kindle version is $13.49. You subtract the printing, storage, and transportation cost and somehow magically the price increases $12.49. That makes no sense."
4,Okay,"A little too complex, even for a well-read and intelligent scientific consumer.Author and idead in the book are great."
4,What it says on the tin...,"An interesting, informative and entertaining tour through the field of strange things that people hold to be true in the face of evidence to the contrary, from UFOs to witchcraft, by way of Holocaust denial and other oddities. A little dated in terms of what it refers to and, more obviously, what it leaves out, a new final chapter explores why smart people believe some of this stuff.Well worth a read"
4,There must be a reason for the title.,"It's interesting reading. Schermer is a self-admitted skeptic, but he's fair and sound in his reasoning. I'm not quite finished with the book, so am still looking for some of the reasons he thinks people believe wierd things.He talks about the pros and cons of creation vs evolution, holocaust deniers, and even ufo abductions. He certainly presents a variety of subjects to pick from.All in all, worth the time to read because it really can make a thoughtful reader stop and take another look at what might be some pet beliefs."
3,Great topic - lacks depth,"Shermer is the master skeptic. He is consistent, logical and a talented writer. He is also considerate of those who hold to different beliefs than he does.In this book he deals with 25 errors of thinking that people make when they fall into weird beliefs. Unfortunatly he does not develop this enough in the book, and while interesting, the book feels like it only scratches the surface.Shermer can do better and his newer book, Why We Believe is a significant improvement upon this work. Still, If you are interested in Why People Believe Weird Things? than this book is an excellent introduction."
5,Unbelievable Sound and Rhythm,"By far, the best salsa rhythms I have ever heard with such a wide variety. There are slow ballad types, rhythmic dance types and fast high-enery types. It is fun to listen to, even you don't have a taste for salsa. You could say it has a bit of pop flavor to it. I especially like 'Descarga de La Luz' featuring a solo of Tito Puente. And I can't tell you how many times I have dedicated 'Amame' to my wife. Their female lead singer has a wonderful voice. I recommend it. The music is very, very uplifting."
5,Simple and easy!,"Conklin's Grammar Key is a workbook based text on written English grammar rules. The process is clear and the answers are easy to correct so your student (no matter the age) will understand. It is used widely in the home school community and has a few decades of proof. If you are teaching more than one student, it is simple to copy the needed pages but trying to do a dozen copies wastes time and money. Give this man your support, don't pass around your copy so the rest of the world can avoid rewarding these clever works. I learned grammar the public school way and believe me, this works way better."
3,"Ok, I'll go first","I like it. This collection has all the elements that I've come to appreciate from kinkysweet-funky, soulful, driving. I found disc 1 to be very satisfying but disc 2 much less so. I found the first track on disc 2 to be borderline embarrasing and not just because it's a butchery of one of my favorite Beatles songs either. It's just not good, and the rest of the disc doesn't recover quickly enough for me to give this 2 disc collection more than 3 stars. But because I liked the first disc so much, can we make it a VERY STRONG 3 stars? Come on, kinkysweet. I know you can do better. I know because you have."
3,Good but really hard to get the backing off,This is double sided tape. The tape is OK but the problem is getting the backing off both sides without wrinkling the tape. You pretty much have to mess up one end of the tape to peel the backing off and then cut the damaged part off. If there is a trick to removing the backing on this tape I wish they would say what it is. It's too much trouble to use for craft purposes.
4,Brought Back Some Great Memories,"Really enjoyed this DVD. The songs selections were very good, performances by the original bands in most cases also very good. Audio was good, video was very good. I hope more of the oldies get released with this much quality in the future."
5,We wanted it for so long!,If you like 70's music this is the best gift for anybody!! We saw it at a friends house once and we loved it. Then got it as a present buy misteriously lost it. And thought we were done. Thanks Amazon now we have it again.
3,DISCO SOUNDS,Brings back some memories.....the sound quality not so good......but ok if your from that era just to hear that sound again.......Eparaima....
3,Only Okay,"Although this book is only okay, I thought the book did a good job teaching responsibility by showing how Karen learned a very important lesson after disobeying her grandfather which put one of her friends in danger."
3,Just Like The Movies... Huh?,"Movies is by far one of the greatest songs I have ever heard in my life but if you are getting this single for the (Acoustic Live At KROQ) version than your getting it for the wrong reason.Track Listing:1.) Movies = This is the hottest and most inspiration fun song in the world. This has a kick beat that make you wanna go all wild like a rabid dog.2.) Movies (Acoustic Live At KROQ) = I could lie and say this version is good but its not. It sound in know way like the original and if they wanted to make a remix or something that is what they should have done. I don't like this version, it takes all the fun out of the original.3.) Pink Tea = This is a great song and is another highlight on this disc, I suggest you check it out.4.) Movies (Original Video) = This is the original video not the second version, for those of you who know what i'm talking about.Just like the ""Movies"", this disc is going to sell out as fast as you can pop popcorn."
1,Do not buy from this company,"I waited almost 3 weeks for this text book. Then, instead of shipping it to me, they refunded my money. Do not buy from here if you want your book in a reasonable amount of time."
1,no book recieved,"I never recieved this book or the money back for it I was told that the book was a fifth additon not a sixth so I chose not to recieve the book, however I was never issued a return."
3,The Polish Army 1939-1945,Overly brief for the serious researcher but an interesting overview with some areas of excellent detail.
5,Clicker training basics at it's best,I love this book and have given away 2 copies already. It's a fun book to use and explains easily how to train your dog while both of you are having fun and playing games.
5,What a joy!,"This book is a pleasure -- easy to use, practical, and chock-full of techniques all can use, with an underlying philosophy of kindness to dogs.Dog training has entered a wonderful world of efficient, gentle work, done by persuading dogs to comply voluntarily. This book is a great example of this method.There are no silly rules that cram your dog into a simplistic mold into which all dogs supposedly fit, but the knowledge to teach the dog you have, using its own tendencies and preferences."
2,Only if you have doubts,This book will answer all your questions about training your dog but won't teach you much about how to do it.
2,"Trendy Prop ""Training""","REAL dog trainers do not use trendy props for ""training"" such as clickers, toys and food!!! REAL trainers teach the dog using proper praise and discipline, which is not force such as these bleeding hearts love to falsely CLAIM!!! Dogs ""trained"" using clickers, food and toys are not reliable and will break their ""training"" when they get bored. I am a REAL trainer and my results speak for themselves!!!"
4,absolute necessity for Star Wars roleplayers,"This book is the second edition update of Star Wars: TheRoleplaying Game. The information is somewhat strewn about,but anything you need to know to play the game is in here.Not only is it an essential guide, but it is an excellentsource of information."
3,Disapointing,"I used to own the original 1987 version of the Star Wars roleplaying game but lost it. I was looking to replace it and figured that I would buy the version of the game. Not a great decision, you figure that a 2nd edition would better en enhance the first version ? Not the case, you can tell from the book that instead of pictures, you get drawings, not always related to Star Wars. The rules have become more complicated and some of the character templates have be changed or even erased. If you wish for a space themed roleplaying game in a D6 system, this could certainly do, and there is still a big Star Wars flavor to it but it does not come close to the original 1987 version."
4,best street novel,"i loved the author's attention to detail, it pulls you in and makes you feel like you know the characters personally. once the story started to take off, i couldn't put the book down, especially when it came to dee and his situations. you'll love this book, and i hear the author's next book is even better."
4,Shine On,"I enjoyed this book. It tells the story of Black through his brother Dee and their struggle, dreams and desires, rise in the drug game and the ""perks"" and blood that comes with it and then the heart aches it eventually bring to those that they love.It was so real that you could feel the emotions of it. I could picture the scenes, that is how vivid McNair writing is in this book. Cannot wait to read more in Black Reign."
1,Simply horrible,"I could not finish this book. I felt like so many characters were being thrown into my face that I couldn't keep up with who's who. I can usually read a good book in a day or two. This was one I tried reading every time I went to the bathroom and after two weeks, finally I just gave up. I read the last page just to see what happened. I bought this book and the sequel at the same time. I'm so mad that I wasted my money."
2,Loyalty within a family is priceless....,"Mr. McNair did a good job on his debut novel, ""My Time To Shine"". He brings to life three brothers and their cousins' struggle out of poverty. These boys all hunger for the glitz of money and power, but the youngest of the crew is the mastermind. Black is low key but his main goal is to get money and take care of his family. He ain't messed up about the rest. I love the closeness of the familial ties, even down to their mother's relations and how they scuffle to make it in the drug game and keep family first.Mr. McNair gives plenty details and has a host of characters. The storyline keeps the curious mind's attention awaiting the outcome to this saga."
2,can we pick up the pace a little,This book moved too slow and it lost me in just a few chapters. I tried to stay with the story line but it is so hard when you keep yarning. where is the excitement.
3,a tangled and twisted street tale,"The book starts out a little slow but gets a lot better. You can see a lot of real characters and it's different that this is coming from a guy's point of view, whereas most street books are narrated by females."
3,my time to shine,"I thought that the book was a little hard to follow at some points. the way that the author wrote the book and the slangs sometimes frustrated me to the point where i just wanted to put the whole thing down.When i read a little more, it got sort of interesting. I did not appreciate the way that the author portrayed women. Sometimes i was down right disgusted and upset. other than that, it was okay."
2,MAZE,This book started out with BLACK. The additional characters do not have chance to develop. I mean everytime I thought I knew someone they started to introduce someone new. Maybe it should've been a part one and part two. When I finished the book I could not wait to tell my book partner to quit reading while you still have time. The cover sells the book..the contents brings about regret.
3,"14 Watt Bulb, not 11 Watt as described","These are nice out door lamp post bulbs, enclosed spiral CFL's from GE, which have a good color rendition.However, it turns out that this item, the GE 49894, is not an 11 watt 500 lumen bulb; Amazon is instead shipping a 14 watt bulb that purports to put out 750 lumens, the typical equivalent of a 60 watt bulb; curiously, the GE packaging claims that the 14 watt is only equivalent to a 40 watt standard bulb, but the packaging and the writing on the bulb claims the bulb has a lumen output of 750, not 500 typical of the 11 watt cfl's which are a 40 watt equivalent bulb.Who do you believe here?This appears to be a GE labeling issue, and whether you receive a 11 watt 500 lumen or 14 watt which claims to put out 750 lumens, but is only a 40 watt equivalent, is not clear."
1,Went Dead in less than 1 month,this was installed on my post lamp fixture in my front yard. may be an issue with the bulb I got but it was dead after less than 1 month of use.a standard incandescent bulb would have lasted the better part of a year.
2,Quit working after one week?,"To be fair, I have yet to decide if maybe there is an electrical problem on my exterior carriage lights which are also on a switch timer, or whether these are the most short-lived bulbs I've ever seen. After installing them in two garage carriage lamps that are on a timer they worked fine for about a week. They provided a very nice light that was not too bright or dark, but after a week they began flickering badly. After a few days of this one side's tube had almost all but burned out. There was still some light, but for the most part the light was gone and the other one started flickering. I took them out, tried again, and ordered two more. Same problem occurred. Hopefully it was just my bad experience and/or carriage light wiring because they really were well suited for outdoor use and provided a great exterior light!"
5,light review,The light bulb is a replacement. The previous one lasted four years. The lighted space provided is approximately seventy ft in diameter.Excellent product for outside lighting!
1,40 WATT LIGHT BULB,RETURNED THIS PRODUCT. DID NOT WORK. DEFECTIVE. OUT OF THE BOX LIGHT BULB DID NOT GIVE ANY LIGHT.
2,THE TRUTH from someone who knows what they're talking about,"Here are some noteworthy tutorials perhaps you may find a use for, even though I did not: DVD mockup, Book mockup, Grudge Effect, Making a Photo Look Old. The best tutorials are by Felix Nelson, because they are original and unique. Scott Kelby's stuff is kitsch. He copykats what graphic designer's are doing today and recreates a cheap knock-off tutorial for this book. Best Buy, American Pie's Logo, etc. Why the hell would I want to make a logo that looks just like American Pie's logo? Or a logo that looks just like EA Sport's logo? How trite. But if that's your thing to steal, mimic, and make crappy versions of the original then go ahead. I used to respect Kelby, mmm not so much anymore. Anything for a buck and reproduce filler garbage for the masses. I pity anybody who uses this for commercial purposes or for anything that the public will see."
4,Cool Effects = Good Book,"As with the previous versions of ths book, Kelby does not let us down. This book takes off where D&DT; for Photoshop 7 took off. Kelby's approach to writing these books is excellent. He has a great sense of humor throughout all of his books. What makes this book so helpful is that it gives you an easy step-by-step instruction to putting together many of today's widely used or popular effects.My only complaint is that some of the effects he chose to recreate are a little lame, almost too easy to recreate if you try at all. Though many of these effects build on more advanced techniques, a user with a rough experience in Photoshop can recreate most of the effects with easy."
2,Nothing Earth Shattering Here,"I absolutely LOVED the Photoshop 7 version of this book, but found very little useful information in this newest book. The techniques in this one were not so different from those in the last book - just a different context for much of the same ""tricks"". I am a huge fan of Scott Kelby, however, I found myself quite disappointed in this book."
5,A great way to learn Photoshop techniques,"I saw Scott Kelby demonstrate a number of these techniques at MacWorld in San Francisco. They are quick, easy to learn, and create wonderful results.After his presentation, I immediately went to booth selling books, and bought this. I highly recommend it."
5,There is nothing better,"Scott has done it again !!!!! I am new user of photoshop and Scott has made it so simple for me to ""fake a pro"". Whenever people see me utilizing his techniques outlined in his books they think I have a degree in graphic designing. Keep up the good work Scott, I will be buying most of his books.Mark---Florida"
4,Great book when paired with....,The Photoshop CS Book for Digital Photographers (Voices That Matter)Both books are by Scott Kelby. He does a great job of telling you exactly what you need to do with the photos.
3,Great book but nothing for photographer not in ad field....,"I have bought many, many books on Amazon and this is the first I am returning that was not received damaged. I am a photographer and could not find anything in this book to justify keeping it - there is simply nothing which applies to my personal photography interests. I think it should be titled Down and Dirty Tricks for the Graphics Designer.That said, I like his style and his recipes are easy to apply and clearly demonstrated. If you are in a commercial advertising business, web design, etc, this would be a terrific book to own. For those simply interested in editing and improving your photos via Photoshop CS, this is not the book. I am going to try to read some of his other books and see if there is one that is applicable, as I certainly like his teaching style."
1,Just for beginners,Well I was expecting some really down and dirty tricks but the book is very basic itself. I think you should consider buying the wow book or something else.
2,"Don't Quit Your Day Job, Scott","Scott Kelby's 'Photoshop CS Down & Dirty Tricks' did teach me one or two new things I never knew before (the rest were acquired for free on Adobe's Studio Exchange website), but at what cost? First, the author subjects his readers to the most juvenile, inane humor(insert question mark here) in the introduction (""Preamble"") and at the beginning of each chapter to make us believe he not only is the Messiah of Photoshop but also way cool. Second, most of the effects in the book are geared for graphic designers. There's very little usable information for the digital photographer. What is written concerning improving or tweaking an image is gimmicky and really doesn't do anything to improve the overall image. As a photographer, I wouldn't recommend this book at all for someone who is looking to improve the overall quality of their images."
3,It's what I needed,I got this & except 2 minor problems am quite delighted. The 2 problems I did have is there was instructions in 3 lanuages on how to install batteres in the chime but none for how to open the buttons door to install its battery. By luck I thought to use a nail file but they should really tell you that. The other is it should have an alternative metheoud to the double sided tape to hang the button. Tape wears out especially in humid weather. You lose the bell you don't have a back up yo're out of luck. A screw or nail hole in the back of the button would be much better.Ok for those of you who can hear perfectly well that could easily become a loud obnoxious chime to those of us with a hearing loss a lod sorta obnoxious chime is a good thing. It's loud but of a low enough pich I could hear it from anywhere in my apt. I'm sorry if it annoyed you but in my case that;s perfect.
2,Loose Battery,"Battery was loose in mine as well and now after unsuccessfully trying to re-adjust the metal connectors and also inserting some putty, I am in search of a replacement button. Annoying and now a time waster to search for new button. I like the ring tone and found it rung each time button was pressed as long as the battery hadn't slipped out of place, which was often"
3,"Really annoying ""chime"" sound","This is an OK doorbell. I really don't like the sound of the ""chime""; it's like a loud computerized digital ""ding-dong"" sound. When someone presses the button two or more times fast in a row and it gets overloaded, the ding-dong doesn't have time to ring. (That is, you should not press the button two or more times fast in a row. Most normal people don't ring doorbells in this obnoxious way, but I have a neighbor who does and it's extremely annoying and sounds like it might break the doorbell, though it hasn't yet.)Otherwise it's quite reliable. I haven't missed a visitor due to not hearing it. I haven't had trouble like the other reviewer with the battery falling out. All the hardware's pretty sturdy. But I still don't know if I'd recommend it due to the annoying ring. And the ring is at a certain frequency that it really freaks out my cats and sends them racing around so I trip on them on the way to the door."
4,Product works well,A nice simple door chime kit that hasn't had any issues. It's a reserved style that doesn't draw a lot of attention to itself. I like the round button over the rectangular older style for the front door as well.
5,"If you like facts, this is for you","I've got the Rock Detector Thrash metal book, so took a chance on this one. Ok, a lot of these newer bands I'm not into at all but buying it for the more METAL styled bands I have to say Im impressed. The band entries are great. I love reading about all the history, when they formed, their inspiration, who was in, who was out. Revealing is that a lot of these bands you thought were new date back further than you think.Hard to find fault really. It's a thick book with a ton of bands. Im sure there could be more but what other book out there is there? None. Great job Rock Detector.The cover is awesome."
2,Of Limited Use,"This book is written like a student's term project report--little new information and a mostly boring writing style.For one looking for basic information about aging, the information is fine. But the title of AGING WITH ATTITUDE doesn't deliver."
5,The Essential Roy Orbison,"The Essential Roy Orbison~ Roy Orbison is a grand compilation from one of foremost vocalists of all time. Orbinson has such accomplished vocal skills that listening to him sing is an incredible experience, nay, I would have to call it sublime. The lyrics are well written and my favorite track of his ""only the lonely"". The book-let is a well crafted piece of work and the photos are very nice. They could have included the lyrics for the songs, but maybe I am asking a bit much here considering that it is a compilation album. Overall this is a wonderful album that should not be missed by anyone that likes good music since Orbinson is such a genius that missing this would be a huge mistake indeed."
2,Poor remastering and little early recordings,"This remastering of Roy's recordings totally changed the sound. These songs now have a huge boost of the background music. The background music is louder than Roy's voice in much of the music. So if you want background music, this is the album for you. I prefer the way Roy was originally recorded. The other problem with this album is many of the recordings are not early Roy when his voice was at it's best, but older Roy singing his early music."
4,Hard to find tracks,"I had most of Roy Orbison's recordings except for Ride Away and his duet with Emmy Lou Harris, That Loving you Feeling Again and they were both on this CD. Worth doubling up just for these 2 tracks."
4,roy,this cd was veryentertaining. Good mix of songs. Would recommend it to people who are not familiar with Roy Orbison's music.
4,Best of Jan and Dean,"This was very fun music to listen to. Listening to it, takes you back to the 60's and just plain feels good! Highly recommended!"
1,The Very Best of Jan & Dean [Import],Terrible sound quality.Cheap CD case. Fell abart upon opening.A total waste of money!thanx Amazon
1,NOT WHAT I ORDERED,"FIRST OFF, THE HOSTA'S I RECEIVED WERE NOT BIG DADDY! VERY DISAPPOINTED. WOULD NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THIS SELLER AGAIN.THE VERY TINY PLANTS I DID RECEIVED ARE DOING VERY POORLY."
1,Don't order from this nursery,"Not a Big Daddy Hosta, miss labeled. Don't order from this nursery. I waited all summer for the Hosta to grow and the leaves were never larger than 6 inches."
5,Yay for Indiana!,Finally a book for Hoosiers! The pictures are very helpful for beginning gardeners or those who just want to learn plant names. Bought as a gift for someone new to the landscaping field and she loved it!
1,Another Bang Session Rip Off,"I own every album that Van has ever created and, to be honest, the tracks on here are actually quite good, but....Don't be fooled...This is YET ANOTHER release of the ""Bang"" sessions Van did in the late 1960's. They have been released many times under various album names. This is probably all very annoying to Van himself but I suspect that there's little he can do to prevent ""Bang"" from milking that recording session over and over and over.Try searching for the following albums, look at the track lists and you'll see what I mean..""Bang Masters - The Full Sessions"" ""T B Sheets"" ""Blowin' Your Mind"" ""Brown Eyed Beginnings""(Also any other title(s) that include the words ""Bang"" or ""Sessions"" or ""Blowing your Mind"" or ""Brown Eyed xxx"")"
5,Extremely Wise yet funny,"THE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO PLEASING YOUR WOMAN is just what the title says. As with other Idiot's Guides, the book has entertaining illustrations and very helpful ideas in every category of interpersonal relationships. Even if you have been successful in pleasing your woman, you will learn a lot of tips that will make your skills better and delight your mate. Every relationship will benefit from this! And what a terrific Wedding Gift for any man taking the steps to the altar."
1,Pleasing Your Woman -- not quite what I expected,"I was all ready to read about some new sexual techniques I could use. Boy, was I ever surprised:Chapter 1: Doing the dishes;Chapter 2: Washing the laundryChapter 3: Picking up after yourselfSuprisingly enough, it worked!"
4,no title,"Please note that this review is based on the two volume book published in 1921.My,my my! How times have changed! Admittedly Ms. Eichler is addressing the very upper crust of society, or those who wish to be so, those who do not realy have to work for a living. The chapter on cards and calling is truly convoluted. Did people really have to remember so many trivial details about cards, such as the width being 3/4 of 7/8 of an inch? And yet, Eichler has much wisdom about just plain ole good manners and not complaining and being agreeable and courteous whereever we are. How much we have descended in these 84 years! Life was gentler then, and women, though not as free, were far more respected and cared for, at least in her milieu. Are we any better off now? But emotions in those days were totally trampled, as Sherwood Anderson so desperately pointed out."
5,"""To Love Again"" Is Right.....","Well Finally!After Waiting For Over 15yrs. Motown Finally Released This Great Cd And Boy, What A Rerelease(Tons Of Extras)It Is. The Original Release Was A Patch Work Of Old & New But Showcased Diana's Remarkable Way With A Love Song!!! The Songs Are Wonderful & Bring Back Found Memories. The Added Bonus Songs Are Great, Including ""Endless Love"", ""Dreamin' Of You"" An Extended Version Of ""Touch Me In The Morning"" & Plenty Others!! The Sound Is Glorious!! Thanks You Motown & PLEASE Keep Them Coming!!!!"
5,Simply beautiful.,"I have an old copy of the original album and always thought this was an underappreciated classic. Now, with the re-issue and the bonus tracks, I think it's finally getting its due. What's best about this collection of ballads/love songs is that Diana just sings here -- effortlessly. Her voice is stunning, sexy, and vulnerable and the production (thanks mostly to Michael Masser) never gets in the way of her truly unique instrument. From the original album, ""Touch Me in the Morning"", ""To Love Again"" and ""It's my Turn"" all hold up quite nicely. But I am especially fond of the extra tracks that include ""After You"" (which should definitely have been a single), ""Too Shy to Say"", and ""Come in From the Rain"". Diana at her best.Lawrence"
3,great extra tracks,"By 1975, Ross' transformation from R&B star to MOR pop princess was complete. Her work with Michael Masser placed her firmly in pop's firmament and her work became increasingly ballad oriented. ""Love Hangover"" not withstanding, Ross almost exclusively hit the charts with treacly MOR ballads that are presented here. Ashford and Simpson may have produced her better, but their work gets no mention here. The songs here are well written and impeccably produced, along the lines of Melissa Manchester, Olivia Newton-John, and Streisand, Ross' obvious career model. That said there are some gems here, especially the tracks from 1977's ""Baby It's Me"" which will hopefully be rereleased on cd. If you like Ross the balladeer, then this cd is for you."
5,Wow,"I never really like Diana Ross, but there is just something about her that says Diva and I am happy I listened to the hype and got this LP. Diana you are a Diva and thank You for a lifetime of great music!!"
3,Cringe inducing music,"The scenery is wonderful. Serene, breath-taking, relaxing, mesmerizing, intoxicating, blissful, fluid... and then, the music. Some parts are mundane piano, others sound eerily like slowed down horror movie music, still others are old and canned sounding, and then there are others that are indiscribable. I don't know what the goal of the sound was. Maybe some type of high-pitched new age warped music? That could have been the goal, but what they created was only what I can imagine would be the sound of that drowning cats would make. I have to turn the volume really low or off to play this. Listening to the dvd counteracts the effects of watching it. Why put all the energy into the film making and then slap some horrendous music on it?"
2,Disappointed with dvd,"When I saw the cover and other reviews I thought the dvd must be good and purchased it. But i was disaapointed with DVD. There some scenes of the sea shore which look like they are shots of waste water floating around. Also the filming of the dvd is not professional and leaves much to be desired. Even a child could have filmed better than what is filmed in the dvd. Some outdoor Yoga and pilates dvds have much better locations and scenery captured on dvd , even though their main focus is yoga or pilates excercises. The music is also boring. May be that's why the dvd is cheap."
1,Never received product,I ordered this product but did not receive it because it was not available. Not that is was out of stock but that the seller did not have the product no longer.
4,A View From Within,"At some point in time, a ""Wide Open Window"", of opportunity will unveil itself. Envision an atmosphere where one navigates the possibilities of merging ideas of the present and future then you'll discover a remarkable young pianist named Deanna Witkowski. ""Wide Open Window"" is Deanna's sophomore effort; I haven't heard her debut recording from 1998. Deanna hails from the Windy City, upon this riveting second outing, the wonderful talents that this lady processes informs that you're in for impeccable journey in jazz blended wrapped by the intriguing melodies of Afro-Cuban music that lures you into the grace and beauty of this exquisite collection of music.If you're looking to embrace jazz with a touch of Afro-Cuba flavored ingredients then this record comes highly-recommend. Keep all eyes upon Deanna Witkowski and her record label Khaeon Records, please follow this core of diversely talented jazz musicians that are on the horizon.Rob Young, Abstract Groove's"
3,Two eras on one disc,"This is an unofficial Russian compilation with the international edition of 1977s Let There Be Rock and 1985s Fly on the Wall. I have these separately though I have a similar release on the same label with the follow-up studio releases of each.LTBR is from the Bon Scott period. It's the last one with Mark Evans on bass (Cliff Williams joined by the time the album was released outside Australia). A couple tracks from the Oceania release are taken off. ""Problem Child"" (also on the non-Australasian edition of Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap) and show staple ""Whole Lotta Rosie"" are featured as well as the tongue in cheek title track.Fly on the Wall, the fourth with Brian Johnson and first with drummer Simon Wright was not as succesful as earlier albums and is better remembered by more loyal fans like me. Without Mutt Lange or Vanda & Young producing, the sonic aura of the past isn't quite there. Not quite my favourite of theirs but if I saw this CD or the original EU one I'd get it."
3,Survivor meets the Blair Witch Project,"The Expedition stops every few minutes so that the team can share there feelings/complaints/ fears. After awhile it gets very tiring (perhaps like a real expedition) - but like the Blair Witch Project you find yourself cheering for something to (please) come out of the darkness. The hiking had to be arduous and dangerous - but all of the second guessing and bickering makes for miserable viewing. You wonder if the director scripted some of the drama - or simply encouraged the team to talk about it every five minutes. However, for the excellent footage of the African scenery the dvd set is worth three stars."
5,a good beginners book,"This is a great book for beginner potters that like step by step instructions along with pictures for projects on the wheel or hand built. It explains glazes, slips, kilns, surface decoration, making plaster molds, etc. An overall good book to have in your library."
2,The Abboud&#65533;s Move,"Habibi is a book about the Abboud family and they are going to live overseas. For a quarter of the book it takes place in St. Louis, and then the rest of the book, it takes place in Ramalah. The issues this book brought up were the prejudice between the Palestinians and the Israelis. I thought that this book was a very good example about what prejudice is. I liked the book because it had a nice story line, and it was very easy to understand what was happening. My favorite part of the book was when the family was learning Arabic."
1,Poetic fuzzy-headed thinking,"As a tutor for middle-school and high-school students, I thought that this book would be an age-appropriate, poetic introduction to the complicated history of Palestine and Israel as told by a teenager. I was appalled to find that this book is very slanted toward Palestinians, portraying Israelis as either ashamed of their actions or brutal, mindless hoodlums. As a feminist, I was also irritated by the non-portrayal of the mother, who is two-dimensional at best. If you must have your students read this book, please pair it with a book written from a Jewish perspective. Or, brush up on your Middle Eastern history, so you can bring some depth and nuance to a complicated problem, and not the simplistic stereotypes as found in this novel."
3,Interesting Yet Unskilled ~ Nye provides an interesting and a bit surreal story in Habibi,"Naomi Shihab Nye's Middle Eastern story, Habibi, is about a girl moving to Jerusalem leaves many unsatisfied. Her word choice has left many in the blue, and her style leaves many feeling that she is better off writing poetry than novels.Liyana, a half Arab 15 year old girl living in St. Louis with her brother, Rafik, and parents, is suddenly told she will be moving to Jerusalem very soon. Given very little preparation time, she deals with the prospect of losing all her friends, and everyone she knows. She soon has to deal with the tensions between Arabs and Jews in Israel and the Middle East.Nye quite frequently uses capital letters, some of which are felt to be unnecessary and pointless. However, those are of moderate importance in poetry, and hence she has been very well acclaimed as a poet. She is also quite obvious in her sentences, a quality that I do not particularly admire."
5,dynamite heroine,"The best thing about this book is its spirited and vibrant heroine. Are we not all weary of the wimpy creatures who inhabit mainstream fiction? Self-absorbed, consumerist, utterly fashionable? This young woman is all heart, energy, takes risks like a kite in a high wind. My favorite moment is when she stands in front of an Israeli tank and shouts, 'Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?' or the equivalent. A young spirit with values, with a purpose and high standards. Love it!"
4,A Story That Is To Good For Words,"Fourteen-year-old Liyana Abboud is about to take the biggest trip of her life. She is moving to Israel, to meet her father's Palestian family -including her grandmother Sitti- whom she has never met. At first it is hard living in a land where a lot of people do not speak English, (including her family) and learning Arabic, but then Liyana meets Omer, and everything changes. But, Omer is Jewish and in a land where Palestians and Israeli fight, their friendship is forbidden. Can Liyana teach her family to accept Omer?"
2,Anti-Israeli pro-palestinian rhetoric,"This book is extremely anti-Israeli and filled with pro-Palestininian rhetoric. Its portrayal of history is either inaccurate or missing. It presents no context for the actions of the Israeli soldiers, just talks about how mean they are. It justifies suicide bombing as the correct response for frustrated people. It gives no explanation as to the reasons for the conflict. It misquotes Golda Meir and provides no explanation for her statement that there was no Palestine, i.e., a country called Palestine before 1948. The story is somewhat interesting, but sorely lacking in context and history."
2,Habibi,HabibiThe book was not really that interesting to me. Because I did not like the way the book was written. The author spends too much time writing about things that are not interesting. The author didn't have interesting leads that would make the reader want to read the book more. The author didn't write why did they have to move to Jerusalem and she didn't say if Liyana and Omar got together. And if the writer added interesting facts people would read it and the book will be interesting.
1,it sucks don't read it,"it was totally awful, boring, and biased to arabs made out to be saints the one ""good"" jew was this wussy girly-man boy not to mention it was boring and nothing good hapeened 0 stars"
2,"DONT READ THIS BOOK, IT WASNT VERY GOOD","I didnt really like this book. i was really boring 2 me and well nothing reall went on. i kinda fell asleep while readsing it and couldnt really get into it so unless u like cheesy love stories this book aint 4 u. i did like the part though where...........well i don really have a favorite part cause it was kinda boring all the way through and well, i am still waiting 4 the plot 2 begin even after i finished the book, so bottom line is, if ur thinkin of buyin it DONT cause it not that great- Aint None O'Urbussiness"
1,Please don't buy this,"It seemed like chintzy junk as soon as I took it out of the box and it broke within a few weeks. No one dropped it, no one mishandled it, yet parts went loose almost immediately. Then the flashlight stopped working. Please don't waste your money."
1,Dead on arrival,"Don't waste your money/time. Only the regular flashlight portion of this gizmo worked when it arrived -- not the blacklight. The product is very cheaply made, along the lines of the prize in a box of cereal. For the $11.99 I paid I expected something of higher quality. On the bright side, Amazon was great about processing the return and refunding my money."
2,Too Small,"The bag arrived promptly and is very nice looking. The problem is that it is advertised as 18"" which is accurate however it is too small to fit my 17"" laptop. It is only 15"" wide. It is 18"" diagonal. Returning it. Too small."
3,Good promotion for their website!,"This book is basically promotional material for the company's website. Although it contains some very good information, you have to get past the 1-2 self promotion references on each page. I was also a bit turned of by the lack of content. The book has 173 pages in it, but only about 90 have content. The rest are blank or `Summaries'. If you have money to burn, this may not be a bad book to have, but keep in mind most companies will give this type of material away for free for promotional purposes. Not charge you for it!"
1,Does not get under furniture or boxes,"This product is a mist, not a fog, and that means it only works if the flea is somewhere where the mist can land on it. If the flea is under furniture or boxes, it is safe from this. This product has slight variations on the name from the different sellers, but it works (actually it doesn't) the same. See my review the product did not work for me. See reviewKnockout IGR Flea Foggers 6 ozfor more details.TryRaid - Fumigator Fogger - 3 pack. It worked very well in my storage garage. Check your local hardware store, though, to get it faster. This product has to be shipped ground and takes a long time unless you are close."
5,SHOW IS BETTER THAN EVER NOW,"this is The best show ever i've gone to LA and met spencer beforehim and his wife montang are amazing , great actors tooshow is not just about drama but about how life in LA isclubs,beaches and alot of places they show youis like a tour guide with drama in itThe fact That kristin C is now the main star in the show is greatwe all know that LC is boring and if she decided to leave is for the best.THE SHOW MUST GO ONAND looks like its better than everThank god she left..BUT WE DONT NEED SPENCER OR ANYONE ELSE TO LEAVESO I HOPE THOSE ARE RUMORS .....I hope the hills never die and they keep making this show forever"
1,"7,000 years since the dawn of civilization, and this is what we've amounted to...","This show embodies the summum of materialism, the very worst in mankind. How can one be so completely preoccupied with the exterior, and not care about (or not see) what that makes them into? The Hills' cast consist of models. People who are seemingly so drawn into life's popularity contest that anything else ceases to be important to them. The entire globe could be in the middle of some horrible disaster, while these shallow fashion whores' only worry would be finding a pair of shoes that goes with their Prada purse. For some reason, watching this show reminds me of the infamous statement made by beauty pageant contestant Lauren Upton (the URL below). I wonder if this show's cast could find the USA on a world map..."
5,Awesome,"sounds to me like this other guy is a larryphobe, it's the greatest movie of all times, it's absolutely hysterical. you just gotta have the willingness to laugh. and you can't be offended by graphic depictions of tards and cripples"
1,NOT the original versions!,"I have to post this to warn other buyers from doing what I did. I really dislike remakes of hits repackaged in a new CD and sold as if they were the original versions. I bought this CD specifically because from the title and from the previous review posted, I assumed it would contain the ORIGINAL version of Roger Whittaker's songs. This is NOT the case. This is an import CD that clearly on the cover says ""Original Hits"". These are absolutely *NOT* the original versions of his songs that, like me, you may remember hearing on the radio. These are remakes that are ""fairly"" close to the originals, but different enough to tell the difference and really bug you if you were looking for the originals. Whittaker is a great singer and my 1 star rating is no reflection on him, it's strictly because this CD is outright deceptive in being labeled ""The Best of Roger Whittaker -- Original Hits"" when it definitely does NOT contain the original versions."
5,The naked true,"This book is a excelent guide to succed in bussines, politics, and in life. The simple guide lines in this book if practiced will give you and advantage over anybody else. But it should be taken very carefully, because it also could hurt you."
5,Necesario para todo ejecutivo en organizaciones complejas,"Absolutamente todos los capitulos y consejos son aplicables a la vida corporativa. Que nadie pase por ingenuo, siempre habran gente a favor y gente en contra, jefes (principes), hay que saber cuidarse y ganarse el favor del principe y del pueblo."
5,A beautiful book,"My daughters are still too young to sit through the whole story, but I wanted to get this (at a fantastic bargain price) for next Christmas when my oldest will be almost 5 and able to handle one chapter each evening. It's true to the original text with gorgeous illustrations. A classic that I know we will enjoy for many years. I bought a second copy for a friend's family, and they are also looking forward to December to read it as a family."
3,A very intersting look at a differint Baum..,"This is one of Baum's less famous and more infamous series. Being out of print for many many many years and now coming back. I for one am grabbing up the editions as fast as they come out. Similar to the storytelling in his Master Key the Boy Fortune Hunter follows the exploits of three your boys. Now there is a note in the beginning about some of the viewpoints might not be PC, but not to the point (at least in my opinion) that they take away form the story. It is really your typical turn of the century boy's stuff, but it still is wonderfully Baum."
3,"good dvd, but I wanted more direct autopsy.","I needed more direct autopsy for my class, They wanted to see more ""gore"". Its good, and it makes them want to see more. it did serve a purpose so I wont negate my purchase. It is an eyeopener."
3,Hits and misses,"The game hasn't changed much since the last couple of years, but it still keeps you entertained. My favorite part of the game is playing on Dynasty Mode. You get to choose your players and your coaching staff. It feels like you were a real GM of your favorite team.I like the new FIBA World Championship. I just wish you could play single games with international teams instead of having to play the whole championship.I feel like the commentaries while you play for this game are not as good as the ones from NBA Live 2005. Creating your own player was better, in my opinion, in that game too.I kinda miss the option of watching the cheerleaders coming out at halftime in NBA Live 2000. I wish they still had that option. Even though it serves no purpose for gameplay, it feels more realistic."
3,zappa's drummers remember,"this dvd is pretty much what you'd expect: players discussing zappa and their experiences with him. i was hoping for a little more. i was hoping for demonstrations of the drum work on zappa's material. instead when they are at the drum kit they just kinda jam. that's ok but not worth the price of this dvd. overall, i'd say there should have been someone other than bozzio moderating: someone who knows how to make it interesting by bringing out interesting points."
2,Good but not as we used to hear from Yanni,"He used the vocals too much in this album that seems to be no music, and the emotions of this album buts you in the junglethis is not Yanni's styleI think this is his worst album,tracks 6 + 10 are very good."
1,Disappointed,"It has been a couple of years since I have purchased a Yanni album, as they often had songs on them that I already had. I guess I got behind in the changes with Yanni. Last week, I bought four albums from Amazon.com, and I received ""Tribute"", and ""If I Could Tell You"" yesterday. I loved both of those albums. Today, I received ""Ethnicity"", and was very disappointed. Most of the music highlights vocalists. I particularly disliked the grunting man's voice in ""Almost A Whisper"". Hoping for better things with ""Truth of Touch"" which I have not received yet."
3,Ethnotsoniceity,"As a YANNI fan I am only going to give this CD 3 stars. I would have given it 4 stars if Charlie Adams had taken care of the percussion which is something that Yanni does not have knack for as you are probably aware of if you have listened to Yanni's last couple of CD's. Listening to this CD I hear bits of Mike Oldfields Tubular Bells III type dance music. I imagine some people may love this type of sound, so listen to the samples before you let any review influence you."
2,THIS CD WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Like many others, I looked forward to the Ethnicity CD with great anticipation. Prior to its release, my friends and I--all big Yanni fans--bought tickets to his Ethnicity concert as soon as they went on sale. We actually had seats in the 9th row! When the CD was released, we all hurried to buy it. After listening to it a few times, we decided to sell our tickets on e-Bay (at a loss, I might add). The vocals just don't cut it, especially when he added them to an old instrumental that previously had been a great piece of music. Yanni, I hope you will read some of these reviews and take note."
4,A new album from Yanni,"The first time I heard about his new album I was like WOW ...I found this site that had samples of each song ,I heard them ,and I was really disappointed. But then when it came out I bought the album and I changed my mind.Its right that it has alot of vocals and some Yanni fans - including me - are not used to it.This album has its own style unlike Tribute & Live at Acropolis. I liked most of the songs especially ""Playing by Heart "" & ""Never Too Late"" . The album also includes 2 songs with lyrics : ""The Promise"" & ""Almost a Whisper"""
1,Not the Yanni we know and Love,"I listened to this in the car and couldn't wait to get home to write a review to warn people. This CD should have been called ""Tribal Chants with Yanni"". This is NOT the music we are accustomed to hearing from this incredibly talented performer. The tracks were all rather redundant. The vocalists are very fine indeed, but that's not what we enjoy about Yanni. I enjoy his melodious instrumentals as a way to relax. I have never found chanting a way of relaxing. In my humble opinion, this is just not the Yanni we know and love. I am quite disappointed in this music. He should have stuck with Linda Evans because evidently she knew what his public enjoyed! As far as I'm concerned, his best music was Live at the Acropolis (which I know Ms. Evans had a hand in), mostly because the full orchestration gave his music such depth and body. This is my favorite and it's going back into my CD player and ""Ethnicity"" is going in the trash! Sorry!"
2,What happened?,"I never though I would hear a Yanni album that I did not like but he succeeded this time.I have always loved his instrumental new age style, this type of music is definitely not my cup of tea. I am not saying the album is bad, but I will probably not listen to it again.I agree with some other reviews I have seen, lose the vocals."
3,Strange,I was excited when I heard Yanni had a new release. Another disappointment. So far only three songs I found them different and creative. Others are basically old songs with new instruments involved.
1,Must Even Out,"I've been a Yanni fan since I got ""live from acropolis"" album. I liked the instrumental music he makes. I've been to one of his concerts and loved it. Ethnicity, which I bought before hearing any of the songs, is not Yanni. Most of the songs has vocals. Which muffles the true instrumental sounds. I don't like this CD because of this...too much vocals which actually becomes monotonous Afro-Egyptian style chanting. Yanni should stick to intsrumentals. If he makes more music like these, Ethnicity is the last Yanni album I'll buy. So, if you like Yanni becaue of his style of true instrumental music, don't waste your money on this."
3,"I agree with ""broomschtick""","I read the review above by ""broomschtick"" and found that I couldn't have said it better myself! I guess it was just a let down after ""Tribute"", which was definitely a masterpiece. Too many vocals. And where are all the musicians? The inside cover only lists Yanni, Karen and Pedro. You don't get any better than those three I was interested to see if any of his other musicians came back also. Now, do we have to wait YEARS for another new release? Still a big Yanni fan but not of this release."
5,Great Work !!!,"I am not a die hard fan of Yanni but I like some of his albums. ""Ethnicity"" is a new style for Yanni but is good. The first work ""Rites of Passage"" is really great. I do not see why everyone has these negative remarks."
2,Not the usual,"I really liked Acropolis and ""Best of Yanni"", so when I heard the vocals in this CD, I was *very* disappointed...Yanni fans may like it, but I don't care for it, over all. I bought if for my husband as a gift, and he didn't care for the vocals, either. It distracts from the beautiful compositions that are Yanni's signature sound, in my opinion. Buy one of his older works."
5,A different sound that might be his best,"I own about 10 Yanni CD's/cassettes; I've appreciated his music for years. I was worried about purchasing Ethnicity because I generally prefer just the music. BOY AM I GLAD I GAVE THIS CD A TRY! Ethnicity is thrilling. It's got a blend of Native American, African, Irish, and Asian sounds that mix powerfully with the instrumental pieces. Most of the tracks don't include ""words""--they're rhythmic vocal arias. Unique.Be prepared to close your eyes, to smile, and to maybe take a twirl about your living room!"
2,Disappointed after waiting patiently for a year,"Disappointing...Way too many distracting vocals. This appears to be an attempt to satisfy a segment of music fans perhaps suggested by the label, and not to satisfy longtime Yanni fans. Note other reviews: One can tell by reading who label PR may have paid to write them. Longtime fans are giving exact reason why Ethinicity disappoints.The more complex and symmetrical an item is, the more beautiful it is. This is why Yanni music transcends. Why? For the very reason there are NOT distracting vocals and OooAhhhOhhh like on Ethnicity. If I Could Tell You and Tribute are much better works. This is a very disappointing result after waiting and waiting for his next work. Wait again I shall do for his next release - but I will NOT pre-order the next one from Amazon without sampling the tracks first."
3,Not the Yanni I know,"I am a Yanni lover (metaphorically speaking) and was anxious for the release of the album. He has changed his style on this one. Best way I can describe it is: an Indian singer, a swahili singer, Kenny G, and Zamfir all meet to have a jam session.. Beautiful music, just not what I expected. Lots of vocals."
5,Celebrated diversity in Yanni splendor & creativity,"To me, this is one of Yanni's most splendid works. I experienced Yanni last night as he, Charlie Adams, Karen Briggs, Victor, Pedro, et al, brilliantly performed the Ethnicity selections as part of the Ethnicity Tour. Ethnicity is one of Yanni's finest recordings, in my opinion, building upon his uplifting and celebrated creativity and communicating soulfully to the your heart. I love Ethnicity for its warmth, for its inclusiveness, and for its positive power that is signature Yanni. Ethnicity punched through my logic and drove straight through to my heart."
3,Where will it end?,"Alright, I admit it. I'm a fan. And by that I mean that Jeff Wayne will be able to exploit my enthusiasm for his master-work until the end of time. This time around, it's the not-quite all-new collection of remixes of songs from his 'Musical Version of the War of the Worlds.' There are several new mixes on here, but not enough to comprise a whole CD, so he's padded it with several of the better songs from the previous ULLAdubULLA. At least the price was right.I won't go into great detail about the new mixes except to say that the first rap mix is terrible in my opinion. Other than that, I quite like what's been done. It helps a LOT that I'm a fan of remixes in general.With this and the recent box set, I have about $250 invested in this album, so if you're out there Jeff, bring it on!"
5,Estupendo!!!!!,"Brillante y muy notables remixes basados en el original de Jeff, es altamente recomendable para coleccionistas"
4,good for the fall season,"These towels are nice, the embroidery work is pretty and good quality. The towels are nice, but not as thick as I was hoping. Overall for the price they are a nice buy."
2,A good band that pulls too hard in both directions...,"All these guys have the talent. Vintersorg has an amazing voice, he truly makes my skin crawl in the screeching and his singing is a blinding sunlight from the despairing storm. I really can't stomach the unnecessary double bass blast beat druming that is carried out through the album. Its overkill and doesn't flow with the melodies. Rather, it conflicts with the keyboards and the riffage. With this being said I would much rather listen to EMPIRICISM or ARCAIC COURSE (with Vortex of Dimmu Borgir on vocals.)"
2,very disappointing,"I bought Empiricism and loved that, so went out and bought this a bit later. I have rarely been so let down by an album. The very heavy use of the keyboards is very annoying, along with the fact that all the songs sound the same. If they all sounded like the same really good song that would be OK, but they all sound like the same boring, uninspired, and very UNcatchy song, which is NOT ok. This album sucks, pure and simple. I bought a couple recent Green Carnation CD's the same day...that was a MUCH more satisfying purchase."
5,el primero de jessica.,"esta es la primera produccion de jessica cristina. es este disco estan lso primeros exitos de jessica como ""cosquillas en el corazon"" y ""desatame"". tambien el mega exito ""todo es vida"" grabado a duo con RICKY MARTIN! Este disco actualmente es una pieza de coleccion. muy buen disco."
1,This mount does NOT hinge!,"I ordered 2 of these and will be retuning both soon. I am a road racer. Racers want everything on their bikes to be an exact fit. We do not like ""sloppiness."" I felt like this mount made my the computer/handlebar look ""bulky."" The sides of the mount stay in a ""flared"" out position, and it just doesn't look Pro. I am surprised Polar would even manufacture such a product. I realize that people have different diameters of handlebars, but the thing should at least hinge to make it ""form fit"" the bar. I guess for some people, this mount is fine, but if you are a serious roadie or mtn biker, I think you would be better off finding a different mounting system.Just my 2 cents,Stew"
3,Nice product for bike,It is easy no install but dificult to remove because you have to cut an stripe. Nice product for bike
2,Precisa Ajuda,Os manuais da Polar so muito ruins sem boas explicaes.É necessário ajuda de alguem que já utilizou o produto.
3,"product OK, Amazon annoying","When will Amazon allow people to shop as a guest, without logging in?I don't want to remember a password, and I don't want Amazon to remember my credit card info. But I have to use a password to log-in (so annoying - I know my address and contact info - why should Amazon force me to remember something else to input information I already know?) And I have to actively delete my credit card info after purchases. Saving that info should be an opt-in choice, not the default."
3,Needs To Be More Sensitive And Powerful,"I've got a few years of experience with the Polar bike speed sensor. It works OK, but if it had a stronger signal I'd like it better. You have to make sure it stays in proper alignment and it doesn't take a big bump in the road to knock it out. If you use the auto start/stop feature on your Polar watch and the speed sensor goes south, it ends acquisition of your worlout data. For the price you pay, you deserve a better product."
5,Definitely for any Polar HR owner with a bike,"I bought this cycle attachment as I wanted to view my Polar HR information as I'm cycling. Wearing your Polar HR monitor on your wrist is a pain in some circumstances, as when you pedaling up a mountain and don't need to have your hands leave the handlebars. Yes, I could get yet another HR monitor just for my bike -- but I like to be versatile with what I already have.You use the ties that come with it to attach to the bike. I haven't had any issues in almost a year of use and the original ties are still in place. The mount attaches easily, and you can read your HR data easily. I'd recommend to any HR monitor owner (wrist-band) who also wants to use it while cycling."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this one.,"Poorly written book by a self-serving builder, don't waste either your time on money on this one. The information contained in the book gave very little pratical information from the buyers perspective."
4,JD-1.1 Slant Board,"Very well constructed. Easy assembly. One negative is that it takes a while to find a comfortable arrangement when first setting the height. Also, the leg bars could be wider to provide better and more comfortable support for your legs. More important for the guys than the ladies."
2,Not what I expected,"What I mean by that is . . . the soles wore out in less than 6 months under normal use. They are comfortable, and the velcro make it easy to get them on and off, but they just didn't last long. Sorry Mechanix Ordering was easy but took long time to fill,"
3,"A good start, hopefully something will come of this band.","I have always been a fan of Dino, and it was cool as hell to meet him at the concert last friday @ the sunshine theater here in albuquerque.Dino has always been a great guitarist in my opinion. I enjoy his new cd. He still has the metal slashing speed guitar down.Drummer doesnt need to beat on the drums.. Literally it sounds as tho he is just trying to match speeds with Dino... Just match the music played.Tommy- pick a tone, there are to many differnt tones of your voice. Lead singer is trying to mix it up to much, and im still curious which tone your trying to come across? This might be the fate of your cd sales in the future ;)Overall a good album, a good listen, repeatability? - at least a few times."
5,Fear Factory is back!,"Wait, Burton is not in the band. Neither is Ray Herrera.Oh well, this sounds like a great follow up to Demanufacture. This is way better than the last Fear Factory album. It sounds like Dino is refreshened to kick some butt."
3,descent stuff,"This album is good is you are a speed metal fan. Personally I find speed metal a bit boring after awhile. These guys would be a lot better if their singer would truly unleash his voice. He could easily come close to matching howard from Killswitch engage, if he tried. This cd is a descent listen, but it gets a bit repeditive, as all speed metal does. So I would recomend listening to some samples before you buy this, because it is an aquired taste."
3,"Decent, but nothing Groundbreaking","This disc is OK. Great production, solid riffs (as to be expected) and some cut throat pace.. But there really isn't much in terms of anything 'new'. If you like Fear Factory, yet a little faster, and you like odd harmonies in the 'Mnemic' style, you will love this. In fact, put FF and Mnemic in a blender and this is what you get. I just prefer the other 2 to this.I LIKE it, but don't think it will change the world. Nothing I haven't heard before. But a track or 2 now and then for a swift kick in the as* may do me good.. Keep your expectations minimal and you may not be disappointed."
3,Good album,"Good musicianship and well put together. Nice, fast and angry. Awesome drumming. The only thing I could do without is the harmonized vocals. However, some people like that sort of thing. I personally would rather them stick with the screaming :)"
4,"Charming series, likeable detective","Amateur sleuth novels are not usually my cup of tea but I love Matt Witten's Jacob Burns series. Must be because Jacob's so delightful...a devoted father who's a little embarrassed by his financial success as a screenwriter of a schlocky but hugely profitable Hollywood movie. However, I do wish Jacob wouldn't be *quite* so pushy when he goes about his detective work. You'd think a man with two young sons would be a little more careful. If he weren't a fictional character, someone surely would have bumped him off a long time ago! Witten is a writer for ""Law and Order"" but don't look for the grittiness or realism of that show in his books. Still, if you enjoy humorous, well-plotted mysteries, give this series a try. Witten's books are among the few that always make me laugh out loud."
5,Beautiful collection,"The album earns its title in many ways. Not only are the selections excellent, but the compilers of this collection chose performances from the late 1950's all the way to the late 90's. Well chosen."
5,Works great,Genuine Hoover replacement bags. They work as expected. Came in a Hoover bag and they worked fine. Buy these bags.
1,didn't need these bags!,"Bought a vacuum and these bags were suggested and even looked like they would be needed so i bought them, the vacuum has a built in bag/filter that you just shake out. These bags wouldn't even fit in it."
2,Disingenuis Genuine,"Picture of bag says 'Genuine HOOVER Filter Bags. I was sold and shipped a 3-pack of genuine imitation generic bags instead. While they were made in the USA and may be just as good, don't bait and switch products on customers. I purposely choose theses because they were supposed to be real HOOVER bags."
5,Not her best but still very very good,This is typical Rendell and as always she'll keep you turning the pages. Not really a mystery since we know very early in the book who the rottweiler is. Yet her unusual but believable characters will keep you reading. Interesting take on care for the high functioning developmentally disabled also.
3,Not her best,"Rendell is one of the best, if not THE best. In comparison to most of her work, this was a disappointment. As if she'd scribbled out a manuscript and rushed it off to the publisher without re-working it even once.The characters are too numerous and mostly poorly fleshed-out. Rendell's killers are usually so well defined we feel we're living inside them; this one was two-dimensional and sketchy. The ending was so ho-hum that I've forgotten it already. RUTH! You can do so much better than this! It's not the plot that was missing - it was the style. I hope your next efforts are up to your usual standards."
2,"No, no, no, no!","Rottweiler is the first book I have read by this author. That may be unfortunate because it could very well be the last. The author devotes a lot of time developing characters that, in the end, you could not care less about and plot is weak at best."
1,even an all time great can turn out a horrible book,"I've read everything Rendell has written(including the Barbara Vines) and she is the best in the mystery genre and often transends it. She can therefore be forgiven for this total misfire---thin ,forced and utterly unconvincing. Her forte may well be creating fabulous villains but the one here is trite and uninteresting. I'm surprised so many of the reviews by readers who know and love her work are raves. I'm generally inclined to cut her a lot of slack"
3,Distinctly Average,The weakest RR novel that I have read.The plot-lines and characterization were weak.It seemed to be a hurried effort-had some good ideas but these were not developed enough and only showed the usual RR quality in flashes.Let's just hope that this novel was just a temporary blip and not the shape of things to come.
4,The giant cone vs. the giant cube!,"This novel has some great tie-ins to the original series. The best, however, being the return of the planet killer. The idea that it was sent from just outside our galaxly into the heart of Borg space, preferably straight through the Terran system as well, was awseome. Also, having the spiked doomsday machine destroy a Tholian web was astounding! The Vastator of Borg character was a great added bonus. My favorite part of the book is the final battle between the Borg cubes, the planet killer, and the Enterprise. I recommend this book to Star Trek fans everywhere."
4,A Question,"I have heard that in Star Trek: Vendetta, that the origin of ""The Doomsday Machine"" from the Original TV Series is explained in this Book. Is that True? If so, it would make a good Plot Line for a New ""Star Trek"" Movie with the ""Star Trek: A New Generation"" cast (including 'Guinan')."
1,Wasted Opportunities,"What a waste - the return of the Borg, and its stuck in the middle of this dreary tale of Ferengi and ghosts from Picard's past. It attempts to draw together far too many strings that were never meant to be related, and was a huge diappointment."
3,A Discovery Amongst The Deepest Galaxy,"Halfway through this book, I realized that I would much rather watch a TNG episode than reading it. I put the book on the shelf and starting watching my Season II DVD set. A rare case where I take the box over the book."
3,Giant Planet-Killer Threatens the Universe!,The ending of the this giant novel justified a solid three star rating. If you are a fan of Borg vs. Starfleet then you should enjoy this book. I felt the plot lines dragged on at times but the action generated at the end make it a readable trek.
5,Great joy,"I first heard Cidade Negra a few months ago in a small cd store in Salvador,Brazil. It was on my second day in Brazil. I was looking for something nice not more just to get to know the Brazilien music better then just from hearing the old songs once in a while in the radio. I heard lots of c.d's(mostly what I do in any country I visit) and then from the first bit I felt that this is far more then what I thought I'll find. Great album with great vibes and lots of soul. The first one is a great heartfilling song. The new version with gilberto Gil to his old song in track six is great. Check out tracks 4 7 and 12 as well. I was in the concert itself in September in Rio De janiero. A great show but mostly with lots of love from all the band.When you bring your heart soul and joy to music thats how it sounds..."
3,Buen trabajo!,Personalmente tenía una expectativa muy alta con este libro. Finalmente no resultó ser el trabajo que yo esperaba. De todas maneras es recomendable para leer tranquilo y en dósis de lectura pequeñas.
2,ok,Product lets you change between full flow and low flow. Why would anyone want low flow? The point is to save water - i.e. while you are doing dishes. I would like this aerator to have a full off position.
1,NIGHTMARE!!!,Would have left no stars but not an option. This machine left swirls all over my wood floor that looks like wax never buffed. When cleaning the carpet it ends up with the dirt plus the water left in the carpet. Gave it a couple tries and finally I give up. Do not waste money on this cleaner. Im out a hundred bucks on this piece of junk!!!
3,"Great machine, but could have used more info before buying","Wrote review last week, but don't see it. Machine was simple to operate, set up and use. Very light weight. My problem was that I didn't know that hard floors does not include vinyl or linoleum kitchen and bath floors( anything that is 'no wax'). So that means you CANNOT wax, polish and buff your vinyl or linoleum floors with this machine.. It spec. says not to, I tried anyway and it dulls the finish significantly, It's great for WOOD floors, but that's it. It did scrub nicely, but there is no water extractor, so it has to be mopped dry and it would be useless for a large carpet area for the same reason. Would take forever to dry, so only good for carpet 'spot' jobs. I have now learned that 'hard'floors do not mean 'uncarpeted areas,but wood, tile or cement floors."
1,disappointment,"I ordered the Floormax supreme on April 16. 02 and it was delivered within a few weeks. I used it for the first time during the Memorial day week-end, scrubbing twice the venyl kitchen floor and once the bathroom tiles floor. I also tested briefly the buffing pads.On June 3. 02, I started shampooing a carpet, unfortunately I was only able to shampoo 3 square feet of it, for one of the brushes was not longer attached to the shaft. After a short inspection of the machine, I noticed that one of the plastic shaft was so deficient that the brush could impossibly be fastened... What for a poor quality !!!Resumee : the floormax supreme does a good job. The reliability of the parts used are far below average. Why making such parts out of plastic when they are put under stress again and again ?The machine is now beeing serviced, by the way : it will take 3 weeks.Where is the legendary Hoover's quality ?"
4,Floormax vs. Shale tile floor,"Japannese Shale is a compressed layered floor tile of multicolors reds, yellows, browns and some black. it is laid in the same manner as Quarry tile joined at the edges with a light sand textured hydro type cement. It is a very attractive hard floor with a rough shale looking finish.I purchased the Floormax specifically to cleaning this floor in that shale floors presents a problem and cannot be succesfully scrubbed with conventional methods.The Hoover Floormax does anan excellent cleaning through the brushes ability to ride over and into the crevises of the tile."
1,Broken within one hour,Even though the unit is much too light weight for the job it should not have broken in the first hour of usage. I will replace it with a different unit which I intend to purchase from a local store where returns are not the problem as returns are with Amazon. In the end this was NOT a a good deal.
1,Bad news,"Bought this product as used item, but did not expect it to be broken beyond repair. Contacted the seller, who promptly issued a return label and gave me a full refund. Apparently they were not aware of the damage either. The seller even gave me a gift certificate for all the trouble I went through with this machine.Even if you find a new one I would not buy this product. The handle is very flimsy and wobbly. The gears are plastic and you cannot get any replacement parts for it when anything breaks."
2,Awful on polished tile,I was looking for an easier way to maintain my new polished tile floor. This machine left the floor wet and streaked. I even went out and bought the lambswool attachment to polish the floor and it was ineffective. At this time I am back to a mop and bucket. Also the cord is quite short.
2,Carpet cleaner???,"I recently ordered this machine on line and eagerly awaited it's arrival as my fairly new carpets now needed some TLC. It was sinple to put together, lightweight and inexpensive. I used this machine first on my harwood floors (the entire first floor of my home). It worked wonderfully, although you do need to mop/buff them dry. Then on to the rugs...the braided area rug I have was a breeze and came out beautiful then when I was about 1/4 of the way through the second room (my low pile area rug)the machines brushes would not spin along with the mechanism nor stay attached. I tried to call Hoover for help/information to see if this was a quick fix and it lookes like my 4 hour old machine will now need service. How disappointing!"
5,Hoover Floormax Does A Fine Job,I am completely satisfied with my Hoover F400 Floormax Supreme. It takes all the HARD work out of scrubbing hard floors and those throw rugs that are small enough to put in the washing machine but fall apart in the process. It doesn't suck up the water so something else is needed. I used a spong mop rinsed in clean water for my tile floors and just hosed off the throw rugs and let them dry outside. A shop vac should work OK too. But for just plain scrubbing the Floormax is well worth the money. This product was shipped as promissed brand new and ready to go to work. And a workout is just what it has gotten and it is performing flawlessly.
1,Leaky and Inconvenient,"I bought this item to scrub carpets and floors. I found that if you tighten the tank that holds water/detergent too tight, it leaks on floor when not in use. It runs automatically after plugging it in and pressing lever on bottom but it runs with less resistance backwards. It would be better to have a switch to turn on. It would be better if it ran with little resistance forward rather than backward. Since it does not pick up dirt, it would be better to buy a steamvac that actually sucks up dirty water rather than leave it in carpet or floor."
1,Hoover F4300 Floormax supreme,This product is not worth the money. It made my floors look worse and I can not find the right floor wax anywhere to use with the buffer. I'm highly dissapointed in this product.
1,floor scrubber,just sent a Hoover back to Hsn. It worked very little and was a waste of money. No more Hoover for me
4,Dig this Hoover Scrubber,I really feel like the tile floor is getting a good scrubbing. Downside that it does not suck up the dirty water...BUT I do a section then go over it with an old towel w/ my feet (no bending over) and actually I think this isn't too bad because when you are wiping up w/ feet you can get along the floor boards and that is something no scrubber is doing. So I Dig this hoover scrubber. Haven't tried the rug scrubber part yet but will leave feedback when I do.
3,"It's an INTERVIEW CD, so it's not gonna be great, first off!","Ahoy hoy Well, it's ok. It's an interview CD, so it's not gonna be the greatest CD you've ever gotten. But definitly a collector's item."
4,Timeless Golden-Age SciFi,"In the 1960's ""Shadow on the Moon"" stole my heart, and I read all the Zenna Henderson I could lay my hands on. I bought this and First Pilgramage to introduce my neice when she's the right age. I guess I took the Golden Age writers for granted back then, but today I wish I owned every one I ever read."
3,How the Web (not the Internet) was born,"HTWWB is a detailed look at what brought us to where the Web was at the end of the last century. There is a good (although not as good as Where Wizards Stay Up Late) description of how the Internet itself came to be, and then it goes into the whole set of precursors to what Tim Berners-Lee invented at CERN, which became the Web.The book is notable for really digging back into the precursors of the Web. I've been in networking since 1979 and there were a lot of new things for me to learn in the book.The book is weak where it over invests in the politics at CERN and especially around the horse-trading that resulted in the consortia that manages the Web, W3C. The last fifty pages of what been an engrossing read just drag and drag.I'd give the first two thirds of the book at least four stars, the last third two at best. Still, if you're really interested in how things like URL, HTTP, HTML, DNS, etc came about, this is worth making the effort."
5,"""University Books"" Edition or...?","This is exactly like the much sought University Books edition, from the days before Stuart came along... and it's a beauty! The true story of these cards has yet to reach those in the know from the tarot wwweb-world, but what else is new? If you are a collector, pause here now and think long: these are the ""real"" thing... Ankh backs, vivid colours, and pure, uncopyrighted, Pamela Colman Smith. Salute!"
4,Tropical chills...,"Well, I enjoyed this more than I did Karma or Stone City, both by the same author. I found the setting to be believable and learned quite a bit about illegal banking techniques and roofing. And I would read a book centering on any one of the characters in this one; they're that well-written."
1,TheSacrifice here is any money you pay for this clunker,"Smith has written two excellent novels, Stone City and Karma. Those novels had strong characters and interesting plots, both absent from this boring and shallow mess. The main character, a bank robber whose daughter is killed, never changes or grows as do Smith's earlier protagonists. The killer belongs on a cheesy made-for-TV movie and the resolution is laughable.Let's hope Smith goes back to his earlier form."
4,Good Storyline with a few snags,This book definitely held my interest. What an interesting idea for the criminal to be victimized. Made me think about the fact that criminals are real people just like those of us who are law abiding. I was breathless with suspense but got bogged down during some of the descriptive landscape passages. All in all a real thriller with a main character that you just can't help but fall in love with
3,"It was ok, considering the copyright year 1997, it provided lots of info at that time.","Wish Nolo would update the edition, that's all. Many of the websites no longer exists."
3,"Wish it had arrived - might be great, might be rubbish but don't have it yet!",Bit puzzled why asked to review it before it has been delivered. Unlike Amazon to suffer from Premature Reviews.
3,Back to the drawing board,"I purchased this tripod as a Christmas present for my brother. I did my research and I felt like this one was the best bet. It has a lot going for it, for example quick-release, rubber feet, it seems to be very sturdy, the non-slip grip, and of course the great price. Unfortunately he never got to actually use it because one of the pan head handles did not thread/screw on correctly, so it never got tight. This would mean that if a camera were placed on the tripod it would not hold in the desired position (making it pretty much useless). I hope that this is just an isolated case, and I think it probably is ( I believe they just included the wrong size handle), but I'm afraid I won't be purchasing this exact tripod for him again. The good news it that is was fully refunded. The bad news is it's back to the drawing board for finding the right tripod."
3,solid and light weight,"A family member and I was looking for a entry level still camera tripod. We found this one after looking everywhere. I feel safe saying it's lighter and more stable than your average ""heavy-duty consumer"" tripod."
5,"If Della Reese is in it, it's going to be good","One of my favorite movies, and the story may be applicable to many of today's families. A well-to-do mother of two privileged teenage daughters finds them too prideful for her liking, so decides to show them their roots. She takes them to the place where she grew up, and tells them about the squalor and abuse of her own childhood--something they had previously known nothing about. The story unfolds about an elderly black couple who loved her, taught her, and gave her a chance at a real life. Warm, touching, and absorbing--and they do it without putting anything in that the whole family can't watch."
2,Middle scene skips,I got the dvd looks good I started watching the movie and played good but somewhere in the middle the dvd stopped and skiped ahead I have another dvd player so I tryed it in that one but same thing happened. I tryed to clean dvd and play but same thing it skiped. I went into scene seletion and tryed to fast foward and rewind through the scene where it skiped. I was able to rewind it then try to watch it but it still would stop and skip the scene. so I gave up and just watched rest of the movie but I miss about 20 mins in the middle of the movie. Not what I like to see only part of it.
2,"EEhhh,","Not really a viola book my son uses that often. In fact, hardly ever. Not a lesson book I would recommend."
5,Putting the Pieces of Hollywood History Together.,"This 1000-piece puzzle depicts famous scenes and actors from throughout Hollywood history. The puzzle is very colorful and is a lot of fun to put together. It takes awhile to put all the pieces together, but this puzzle is not anywhere near as difficult as one of those photo mosaic puzzles-those things take forever. What I think is more fun than even putting the puzzle together is trying to name all the actors and actesses that are featured and name the movies of the famous scenes they are in. Some are really easy (Christopher Reeve in SUPERMAN, E.T.) and there are others that are fairly difficult (there are still a couple of pictures on the puzzle that I haven't been able to figure out who the person is and what movie they are in). Overall, this 1000-piece Hollywood Puzzle makes a great gift for anyone who both likes to put puzzles together and is a movie buff."
3,Non-traditional pieces disappoint,"This is a lovely, high-quality puzzle with no missing pieces and nice easily-identifiable edge pieces. However, I prefer puzzles with traditionally-shaped pieces that interlock and stay together. Many of the pieces in this puzzle are like that; however, some have one side that is merely curved, with no ""inny"" or ""outy"". These don't stay together very well until other pieces are located and joined, and that can be frustrating. If you don't mind curved pieces, then you will probably enjoy this puzzle very much. For me, though, it was disappointing, especially because I was planning to buy several puzzles by this manufacturer, and now I'm not."
5,Don't read this book in class!,"A friend loaned this book to me in high school over 45 years ago, warning me not to read it in class. Of course I did, artfully hiding the book behind my class text. When I read ""They got McKinley"" (sorry, you""ll have to read it) I completely lost myself in helpless nose-snorting laughter. After detention and being grounded by my parents, I was lucky enough to find an original copy, which today, taped up and falling apart, remains a favorite book. I am appalled that any editor would consider censoring it. Find an original copy from 1958 and prepare to laugh. Please do not drink liquids while reading, and Depends are recommended."
4,You're stepping on my cloak and dagger,A very entertaining and light hearted look at the OSS during WW11. I read this book 40 years ago and never forgot it. It was nice to find it again.
5,You're Stepping on My Cloak and Dagger ....again !!!!!!,"I read this book when it first came out and thought at the time anyone this Brave with a sense of humor like this and would dedicatehis first book to ""Whom It My Concern"" certainly was someone I would want watching my back in Vietnam. It was much better reading the second time around. Hope to see more from Mr. Hall."
3,"OK, but...","Amusing, but I didn't find myself rolling around on the floor like some of the other reviewers. Perhaps it appeals more to the American sense of humour than the British."
5,Great mysteries with a touch of humor,Enjoyed this book so much I bought 4 more copies for gifts. Great for Asimov fans and mystery fans.
5,Appreciated gift,Bought as a birthday gift for DH. This was actually a replacement for a copy eaten by our 10 month Dogue de Bordeaux. I was quite surprised by the prices for some of the Black Widowers books! We'll have to go through and see if there are any doubles to sell!
2,"Generally poor, but there aren't good alternatives","Many consider this book the ""Bible"" for graduate level analysis. Unfortunately, the dialect used is somewhat obstruse. It is a bit less terse than ""little Rudin"" (Introduction to Analysis), but is a bit spotty in comprehensiveness.The problem is that the alternatives have problems. Simon Hall's book doesn't give as many proofs and doesn't cover the subject matter as much (dealing more with functional analysis). Royden is probably better, but I have not read it much, and I think it is less advanced from what I hear. Folland didn't excite me either.Maybe it is just a difficult subject to write a good text on, but I bet someone will come along and write a better one to take over, like Gallian replaced Herstein in algebra."
3,Comprehensive and boring,"If you need to study for a qualifying exam, get this book. If you want to see why analysis (especially complex analysis) is a beautiful subject, avoid like the plague. Instead, Complex Analysis: An Introduction to the Theory of Analytic Fuctions of One Complex Variable, orThe Analysis of Linear Partial Differential Operators I: Distribution Theory and Fourier Analysis (Classics in Mathematics) (Pt.1)are vastly superior."
2,Ordered wrong Belt,I order the wrong belt. Need a different one.Guess I'll have to take my machine to a shop to find the correct belt & have it installed.
5,parts,This is belts that go to my new vacuum. Not much to say since I have not needed them with the new vacuum. I do like the vacuum.
1,THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR!!!,"THIS LOSER IS NOT THE LOVE TRIANGLE BETWEEN A BOY, A GIRL AND A COMPUTER. THE ONE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS ABOVE THIS ONE AT A MUCH, MUCH HIGHER PRICE."
4,Gracie,"We have listened to hours of Adventures in Odyssey and my daughter and love the characters and stories and Biblical applications. However, when we received the movie version to show the children in our church many of them were scared by the content, some as old as eight. I didn't get a chance to watch them myself, but from a kids perspective the video versions may be too much...stick to the audio."
4,"Really the only option, OK, but a bit clunky","I couldn't find an alternative so there isn't much with which to compare this. It was a bit difficult to open (slide down the outer most collar and pull the halves together) and takes a little effort to put back together. When assembled you don't get a feeling of quality. It is very long, so if the jack into which it is inserted is on the back, you have to have the device a bit further from the wall than ideal. But it works and usable."
3,The weakest of Graphis' Web Series,"The book (1998) predates the Graphis Interactive Design Annual series, and is perhaps it's weakest book on Web design.There is little organized structure to the book. Obviously a great deal of effort went into the design of the pages of this book, but at the expense of actually showing the Web page designs it is supposed to celebrate -- parts of Web pages are vignetted or even taken out of context, removing components of the design from its page.While all the selected site are interesting, and good ""art,"" they are not good design. As a survey of Web sites from 1998, it is an interesting book, but u will gain no insight into innovative communication solutions on the Web.Seek out Graphis' Interactive Annuals or DesignAgencies.com, for better surveys of design on the Web."
1,A soggy mess...,"The water tags are a waste of money. First, the clips are nearly impossible to place on clothing without falling apart. And, contrary to the description, the tags do NOT lose their color when soaked with water; instead, they turn into a gooey, slimy mess and fall apart. Even that takes a looong time.Don't waste your time or money on this product. The kids finally stopped trying to soak the color out of the tags and simply had fun soaking each other."
2,Not what I thought it would be,We're either doing something wrong or this toy is garbage. It doesn't seem to work very good.
4,Wonderful book but good heavens where are the pictures??,"This is a hugely entertaining read that I enjoyed primarily from a 'history of New York City' perspective. Others with interests in the history of culture, broadway, etc. will also find this a great book to read. It's informative, very well-written and a hell of a lot of fun. But if there was ever a book that NEEDED pictures, this is it. The fact that there aren't is immensely disappointing. So many colorful people, places and events so well described and not a single photograph of anything. Very, very puzzling. I'd give it five stars were it not for this glaring omission."
3,"Its good, but....","Dont get me wrong, this cd is catchy as hell. Along with that, the vocalist is VERY talented. Also, the first song has a wonderful drumline, but, the problem is, they use it in every song throughout the whole album. The only differences were a slight change of tempo in some, and an extra beat here and there in others. Great Lyrics, good guitar work, WONDERFUL singing but the drumming distracts me and forces me to give this a lower grade than the rest of it deserves.I hope the drumming improves on the next album."
2,Little better than static..,"On the Last Day has a very refined, good quality sound. There is good energy and the intro is actually pretty catchy. The screaming is not overdone and sounds good as well.Unfortunately for us everything on this album has been done more than once to say the least. It is overall incredibly generic with little variation from beginning to end.If you want the standard upstart post-hardcore sound for some background music then it doesn't get much better than this. Otherwise I would definitely not recommend this cd. Hopefully this band wakes up and sees whats going on around them because they have a lot of talent going to waste."
4,Entertaining,"I generally dont get into screamo, but i would really hardly call this a screamo offering so its ok.Melodic vocals with a more traditional punk beat than most of the s.hit being served up today.Very impressive debut!!"
1,The moral of this story,This book made me feel ill. If you don't agree with abortion DON'T READ THIS BOOK. I am pretty open minded but even I couldn't get past the heroine's implications that people with handicaps would be better off aborted.
4,moving,"The stories in this book not only reflect the lives of men that we might have known, but show the impact they had on those who loved them. A moving testimony to the importance of human interaction, filled with comforting and enlightening moments. You would do well to add this one for your library. The stories chosen have a ring of truth that touches the heart and mind."
1,ugh,"This book arrived on time and in fine condition. I feel bad for anyone who has to read it, it is some of the driest, most boring reading you will ever do."
4,Muscular!,"I'd not even heard of Aaron Comess before hearing him in heavy rotation on Pandora. Everytime 3:33 am came on I perked up my ears! This is not your typical guitar album, it draws more from Eric Wallo, or Andy Summers' solo work, or Steve Tibbets, than Jeff Beck or most of the other guitar gods we think of when we hear the word ""Guitar"". He has a wonderful sense of ""atmosphere, even though the drumming is insistent, original & pulsing. This is, for me, what makes the album work! The interplay between rhythm & melody is stellar!Apparently he is a successful session drummer but he also plays guitar. His style of guitar is muscular, confidant & unique. It doesn't hurt to have Tony Levin sitting in on Bass either!Be prepared for something different, mind expanding & constantly engaging!"
3,Ronny Jordan's....After 8,"neither of the last (2) Cd's I have purchased are quite up to the standards of his prvious work....""Darkman"", but listenable."
3,a little dissapointed,"I have never bought a ronny jordan album I didn't like but this one came close. I just got the feeling the this was kind of put together last minute. It seemed kind of plain, and not well thought out. Some of his guitar playing sounds a lot like other songs from past albums. I like his music and look forward to hearing it. I just expected this one to be as good as his other albums are. Maybe it will grow on me."
2,Why Ronny?,"The last thing i want to see is Ronny Jordan playing in ""glamourous "" hotel for some 60 years old drinking coctails , but his inspiration emptiness drives him there .I would like him to put an album with all the great vocalist he has played all these years and a decent DJ to programme his beats and give us again the groovy feeling of 90's .I hope to listen my prayers."
3,Ronny's latest joint,"This CD has some firing cuts: Bahia Magic:Going uptown:Caught Up are on point, the rest is romantic smooze, which is well done, but no different to what's out there."
3,average compared to other adventure books,"Maybe if I hadn't just read 10 other much stronger adventure books, I would have been more impressed by this one, but in comparison to these, this one is much weaker. The Sydney Hobart Race is certainly interesting and the weather conditions among the worst on earth, but the writer never got beyond the illusion that he was trying too hard to recreate something he didn't know much about. After reading the review below from a sailor who was actually in the race, I started to understand his point of view. There are certainly some fun parts here: the Australian SAR vignettes are riveting and serve to remind us how strong Austrailia is in this regard. The focus of this book is definitely more in the rescues than the sailing. This book was much less well written (not to mention poorly edited with many typos and inaccuracies) and less vivid than the others. For those looking for the creme de la creme, I recommend Lundy's The Godforsaken Sea."
3,Decent,"I recently finished Knockdown, and being a bit of a stickler for details, I did not appreciate his broad use of terms and vague writing style. For example, the use of ""hurricane-force winds"" to represent the conditions is ok; to call a weather system a hurricane is different (even when it is not technically a hurricane.) I love adventure books; this one was an entertaining read. I will be looking for one of the other books however, since I want to get a more factual (and accurate) account of the race."
5,The Definitive Telling,"This is a book for sailors, non-sailors, adventurers, and everyone who enjoys a ripping yarn. Well-written, thoroughly researched, technical where necessary but otherwise written so that non-sailors can understand the action vividly, and -- above all -- fast moving, I would rate this the definitive book about the 1998 Sydney to Hobart debacle."
1,If only the author were a sailor,"Knockdown was a terribly written book. The author obviously knew nothing about sailing. His facts were totally incorect. If you are interested in the sydney to hobart race, read the proving ground."
1,Over flowery,"While I realise a lot of work went into this book, and I applaud Dugard for bringing it together, I have to confess I hated it.Lots of little inconsistencies and the overfamiliarity of a foreigner writing about an Australian race riled me because it is important to get the little things right. Mispelled names of people or yachts involved was just one of many things which was distracting and annoying.I know conditions were deadly, appalling, and life threatening, however, this book (for me) played up on that fact way too much.It read more like a rollercoaster, darstardly, murderous whodunnit puncutated with overflowery, repetitious slang rather than a real-life event which really happened to real people.But hey, everyone's different. Maybe someone else loved it.I've read better."
5,Great Book,"The title of this book leads you to believe that we can learn something from a ""bad"" boy and the book certainly suceeds in that endeavor. I enjoyed the book so much that we are using it for a Bible study with the men's group at our church. Mark Atteberry's insights of Samson are very practical and hard-hitting in our own life. I highly recommend this book for men who are interested in being ""real"" men in this world. You can learn lessons from what others did wrong."
5,Samsn Syndrome,"This person and his life details get little reviews or comments in general, even though his faith is mentioned in the New Testament. This book does a very good job of revealing and explaning why his life turned out the way it did. I found it very well written, easy to understand and down to earth......awesome !!"
1,Don't Buy (Anymore!),"Don't Buy this Game!!!!Don't get me wrong- I bought this game originally a LONG time ago and LOVED it! Good characters, story, puzzles.. the whole 9 yards! When my disc got scratched a few years later I bought a new one ... BIG MISTAKE!Long story short, it does NOT work with most of today's Windows Operating Systems! (Not sure if it's even Mac compatible). I contacted the costumer support of the game company and they basically said Tough Luck! It's just NOT meant to play on today's devices!If there is a way to get it to play, and I hope there is, let me know! Just be careful if you have a Windows XP or newer operating system and you want to play this game!The Sacred Amulet (Jewel Case)"
5,Unlike other motivation books,"Having been a ""junkie"" for motivational material, after a while it all seems the same. But Bill's book was simple, explained how your mind works, and immediately I was able to take his approach and apply it to a problem area for me. already in just one month a huge difference. BUY THIS BOOK!"
1,I am from Tulsa,"You do not realize the spectacular fall from grace this person has taken. Thousands of people lost thier jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars were lost by bondholders of the now defunct CFS Inc. that Bill Bartmann supposedly became a billionaire off of. In the end, he tried to sell the company that was worth several billion dollars to a company for 16 million dollars. That deal fell through when it was determined that it actually had a negative value. His partners defrauded thousands of people and now you want to read his book and give him money. Go right ahead. I know what he did and there is nothing you can do to make it right."
3,Missing Chapter!,"This Bill Bartmann book is awesome! ...if only it was complete.In the Preface you are given a synopsis of Chapter 5, however there is no Chapter 5 in the book.I believe the hardback version is complete. I am waiting to find out for myself.:-("
5,Billionaire Secrets to Success is a Secret to Success,"This is a book that any one who wants to face the reality of life and not shy away thinking that everything will be O K without going through some form of training, must read and learn from it.No greater gift to a capitalist world than this.Thank you Bill Bartmann"
1,Get the record straight first please,"The author might be motivational but also very self-promoting, e.g. quote himself along with Lincoln and Franklin. While he claimed the book was different from any other self-help, he failed to deliver on that. His personal experience was interesting, but he was not very honest. The book was published in 2005, by then he already had the ""how to lose a billion"" experience as in the Fortune article (link below). He still pictured himself as a self-made billionare, which was on paper and lost because of possible fraud.[...]There was some good material, but without integrity the book can only be rated as one star"
4,What a deal!,"Just received my first issue (starting out with the cookie issue is not a bad idea!).Sunset has become a little thinner since I last subscribed, but I still enjoy reading it. A great steal at $5. What's not to like??"
4,Great Magazine for a Year or Two,"I like Sunset for it great West Coast gardening, travel and do-it-yourself home improvement and food sections. But after a year or two, the articles become redundant. I usually subscribe for a period, then drop the subscription of a couple of years. However, it is the best publication I am aware of for plants and landscaping in California and the Western U.S. Most national publications (Horticulture, Organic Gardening, have an Eastern bias, in my experience).Note: The first magazine to come with the subscription will usually be one that's already been on the stands for two or three weeks. If you've already purchased it, contact customer service -- they'll extend the subscription to compensate."
4,Perfect for the Northwest Gardner.,"The best part of Sunset Magazine is opening it up to see if one of your neighbors are in it. A well done magazine that focuses equally on design, gardening and cooking, there are nuggets of advice to save for when you have the time/money to give it a shot. One downside is the advertising section of camps and spas that take up a middle chunk of the magazine, but overall a good NW resource and a nice way to daydream a wet Seattle afternoon away."
1,tough to review,It is impossible to review something I haven't received. I don't know why they would ask me to review a product that hasn't been sent. Another reason I have given up on ordering from Amazon.com. My last three orders have been NIGHTMARES.
2,OK,"Although ordered in October, didn't receive my first issue until December...it's a fantastic price and has been an interesting magazine. Seems the issues are a bit slimmer than I remember."
1,Disappointed,Very disappointed my gift to my friend was not received yet. it was going to be a gift but don't know why it was not received yet. My advice look for something else.
1,FOR SOUTHWEST AND WEST COASTS COOKS,"I live in NYC and recognize the difference between East and West Coast cooking. I find that this magazine is more practical for West Coast cooks. Though different, both coasts can rest on their own merits."
2,Confusion Over Order,"My current Sunset subscription was expiring in a couple of months, so the Amazon renewal option offered seemed like a good idea. However, when ordering, there was no ""renewal"" option given and because my Amazon name and my Sunset subscription name are slightly different, I still don't know if I purchased a renewal or a new subscription, which might include duplicate issues for a few months."
5,A must have for gardener's in the west,"The rest of the country be...well, anyway, the problem with most gardening books and magazines is they seem to be speaking to people who live in the tundra for 1/2 the year. Those whom God has blessed by ordaining us to live in the wonderful west do not have that problem. So it becomes tedious each year to read about how to ""winter"" your garden when you are still weeding and caring for it and would probably fined for stopping. This magazine is the answer to that annoyance.Aside from gardening information they also have ideas for decorating and camping and other family fun things. The only annoyance in this magazine can be found in their recipe section. It is nothing if not gourmet. To be perfectly honest, in CA I don't have time to be a gourmet cook. The weather is too nice to be stuck inside doing all that work. But, I do use their recipes once/month to have our ""formal"" meal. And they are quite delicious."
3,magazine subscriptions,Why don't the people who take this order send an acknowledgment of receipt - I know it is not an Amazon inhouse purchase? I am guessing I won't know if I actually will receive this order until mid January.
3,where is it,"I know I like the magazine, but ..... I ordered and paid for the magazine in July and have yet to receive an issue!"
1,No magazine yet,I ordered the magazine and was charged over a month ago. So far no first issue has been reviewed so I can't really review.
2,Have not recieved it,I wish I could give you a review I ordered the magazine 11-08-09 and still have not gotten it.
5,My wife loves it,"This magazine was a Christmas present for my wife, and she looks forward to getting every issue. I would recommend for yourself, or as a gift."
4,good mix of house and food and travel,like this magazine alot. my only request would be more architecture in it. maybe a bit less flowers. keep it up.
1,Sunset Magazine,I don't know how I like this yet. I haven't received the magazine yet. I bought the renewal a month ago.
5,Great Magazine,"Sunset is a very clever and creative magazine for a number of reasons. First, it has regional editions depending on which part of the West you live in. These editions include both articles about local things and articles from outside your area. They also have tons of really different recipes using local and season ingredients. Sunset also includes information on regional plants and help with gardening in your specific area. When you subscribe, you also get the online edition that can be downloaded to your IPad or Tablet. Love this magazine!!"
2,Sunset Magazine,"As with most magazines anymore, there is very little readable content other than 1 to 3 page advertisements. Might be worth about $5.00 a year for the content that is interesting."
1,Still waiting...,Cannot tell you how frustrating it is to pay for a product and not receive it. Hope it gets here soon!
4,Good... A little too comercial,"I've always thought of Sunset magazine as the type of magazine you'd find in the back of an airplane seat. The kind of magazine with flashy pictures, expensive wines and places you can never afford to go to. This is a good magazine, but I find level of advertising annoying. Also, the reviews of hotels don't strike me as that reliable. Last month, based on a review in this magazine about an inn, we stayed the night at this location and found the service was awful, the 'rooms with fireplaces' not functional and the room smelled bad. These facts were conveniently left out of the review which touted the friendly staff and the great rooms. So I guess, ultimately, I'd take reviews and articles in the magazine with a grain of salt.I DO however like the recipes, particularly the ones which come out around harvest/Thanksgiving time.4 stars"
3,Just Okay,This is just an okay magazine. Not REALLY entertaining and not really boring. All in all not really worth it.
5,haven't received copy of Sunset yet...,"I read the magazine before, so I gave it a high rating (otherwise, I wouldn't have ordered it!)...haven't yet received a copy from this subscription (purchased Sept 23 - today is Oct 25)..."
3,Same content as Tropical Spa,"I was disappointed that this book was the exact same replica of the Tropical Spa book by Sophie Benge, minus the Tropical Spas coverage. I say if you are going to buy it, might as well get the whole thing and get the beautiful and inspiring pictures of the tropical asian spas. It is the same EXACT content from the second half of the Tropical Spa, but their tips are great. Just don't buy if you have Tropical Spa and you think this is any different, because it is not. (As I sadly discovered)"
4,"""FAILED"" is a bit unnecessary - otherwise, ok game","We purchased this for our 5 1/2 year old daughter. She and our 7 year old son have been the primary players of this dance game. The dance pad works fine and is thicker than I expected it to be from previous reviewers. The song choices are tame and age appropriate. The graphics are a bit old-school but certainly satisfactory. My only complaint is that if the dancer isn't successful enough, it declares ""FAILED"". My daughter was having fun on her first dance until the big ""FAILED"" flashed on the screen. You could see the deflating feeling cross her face. It seems a ""try again"" would have been a nicer alternative."
3,"Looks like fun, but it's hard...","I bought this for my 5-year old because she wants to do Wii and PS2 DDR when her teen sister does it, but this one is hard for her. She can grow into it, though."
5,Love it!,"We love this game! My kids ages 6-11 have a blast! My husband and I love it as well. At one point the game did start acting weird. We finally thought to change the batteries and it did the trick. The game has worked wonderfully ever since (with an occasional battery change.) Great game, loads of fun!"
5,dancin' disco,This dance pad is great. Lot's of choices for songs and dance steps. My 5year old granddaughter loved it along with her 30year old mother!!!!!
5,Fun for the whole family!,"I purchased this for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves it and is really good at it. I even tried it and enjoyed it. I have to stick with the 2 arrow difficulty, but my daughter can do the highest level (all 4 arrows). I love that she is moving instead of sitting in front of the TV. I would highly recommend this product!"
5,dance dimensions,"We ordered this product for my 9 year old's sleep over party. It arrived pretty quickly. My daughter and her friends had a blast. I even tried it and it was fun. It has basic skills and a little harder for the more advanced dancer. I would not recommend it for younger children under 5 years. My 4 year old tried it, she had fun, but was not able to do the beginner's dance level. Over all, a decent product. We were happy with the purchase."
1,Don't waste your money,"I really don't expected this from a company like Konami, when i was received that product I put on test inmediately, and i realize that the game was hanging up, I try again several times, at thirty attempted, finally works. The graphics are really bad, like the times of Atari 2600."
4,good,yeh this toy is good man only minor things threw it off the music should have been a lil better and the plastic mat if you are a heavy person or your child is big it would tear after a minimal amount of use to prevent this i put a plastic coating over mine as to prevent the damages other than that prepare to dance your tail off
5,Very fun game!!!,"This is such a fun game! I played it all day at my friend's house yesterday!! It's fun to see who can get the better score at a song. Fun songs, fun steps, and good exercise!!!"
2,difficult to manuver,I bought this for my daughter (whom is 4) and I thought that we could do it together. It goes very fast and hard to follow. Maybe it was me??? I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. We'll keep trying though!!
4,active toy gets kids hopping,"I bought this toy for my triplet 5 year olds. I was worried it would be too advanced for them, but they seem to have fun with it. The pad is easy to install and not hard to operate. I think it will be a fun toy to grow with. It has three levels. We are still on the easiest. I like toys that get my kids up and moving and I would recommend this toy."
3,"good service, poor quality","The service of this seller is good, fast shiping. But the quality of this dancing carpet is poor, the plastic cover is cracked after 2 uses, and the sensors(under the arrows) are slowing down too. Well, this is what we can get for $[...] I guess."
3,"seems good, but....",My 10-yr-old basketball fanatic son watched part of it once and then never again. I guess it just didn't interest him.
3,Kids not Coaches,"I agree with the previous reviewers comments regarding the effectiveness of this DVD in motivating young players to work on their game. From a coaches perspective, however, the DVD seems to be more about Magic and his friends than it is about basketball fundamentals. Way too much chatter and way too few drills to justify the purchase price. There are much better fundamentals videos on the market. The ""star factor"" for young players earns the DVD three stars."
1,One DVD arrived cracked and neither disc worked,"Opened this DVD and saw there was a small crack in one DVD running from the center ring out toward the edge of the DVD; that disc obviously did not work. The other disc continually froze up and would not play, skip, fast-forward, etc. Additionally, the scene select option would not work. The only way the disc would play at all was to start at the beginning. Then, after a couple minutes of play, the disc began to freeze up and became unplayable. Since I opened the product it cannot be returned. A complete waste of money."
5,Books bought for historical significance,As indicated above I love HINE SIGHT and bought it for historical significance. Dr. HINE is one of my favorite historians.
2,Too tight.,"These belts say they will fit my vacuum, but upon installation they seemed really tight. I broke 4 before trying a looser belt from another store. No problems since."
1,Solutions Manual only!,Be careful - this is only the student's solutions manual and NOT the textbook.
3,Descent if your teacher is,I have a strong preference for text books that could teach their subject without help from a teacher and this is not one of them. That being said it is a good book when paired with a good teacher.
4,"The total revision of chapter 5, improves the 4th Edition.","The complete revision of Chapter 5, Factoring Polynomials greatly enhances the students ability to understand factoring by grouping. It is a far easier process than the trial and error in previous editions. The graphics are also greatly improved, but the visibility of the check yourself exercises, found in the chapters, has been absurdly diminished! -1 star for that error in judgement!"
1,This Version is EP speed and has massive edge damage.,"The tape is new and was delivered promptly. However being an EP speed version which was not mentioned, is almost impossible to watch with all the edge damage through out. I will always ask to make sure that I am buying the SP Speed version. I won't make that mistake again."
4,Lives up to its rating.,"I don't disagree with the high praise lavished on this movie. It's just that social commentary isn't my favourite viewing field. If it were, maybe I'd rate it 5 stars."
1,somebody needs to look for another job!!,"The one star in my review of The Magnifivent Ambersons is not for the film or the current release quality although I am very disappointed that there are no special features on the bastardizing of this film. The Criterion release on Laser did a fine job in presenting Well's original storyboards and ending and it is a pity that we do not have that on DVD as of yet. My review is of the idiot who puts the names of obscure actors in place of well-known stars of the film. Is it is his idea of sick humor? This is certainly not the first DVD on Amazon to recieve such ridiculous treatment. I only wish that I had kept track of the other classic films that have suffered such an un-knowlegeable fate, but if you are a true film buff, I'm sure that you have run across them on this website. RIDICULOUS!!!"
4,88 minutes of magnificence,"""Magnificent Ambersons""(1942) is a magnificent film even with its 88 min running time that was left after RKO took advantage of the director/writer/narrator Orson Welles absence by editing down the film from its original 131 minutes. Why or why did they have to cut it so mercilessly? The film still remains a brilliant and ironic portrait of a declining aristocratic 19th century family but the final part feels like a lot's been taken from there. At least, the unique end credits when Welles introduces the cast and all members of the crew were left alone. Still, it is an awesome film with every scene arranged and shot like a rare painting. The one which is imprinted in my mind is the scene when Eugene is leaving Isabelle's (the love of his life) house forever and Isabel's arrogant son George (who will finally get his come-uppance) is watching him through the window in his mother's room. I am also impressed by Welles's narration - he had a very nice voice."
3,SHAME ON WARNER BROTHERS...,"Even though this movie was cut up, in my opinion, it was still an excellent movie with ""great"" acting.The quality of the video is not much better then the original VHS...looks like just a transfer of the VHS to DVD.I think it was pretty nervy of Warner Brothers to push this DVD as ""remastered.""First we had to wait a long time for the movie to come out on DVD...and then, we had to wait to buy the movie by itself.$16 bucks for such a poor transfer DVD is not that great a deal for me!"
4,On sale on Amazon's French site,"FYI, there's an official release of Ambersons on DVD that's available from amazon's French site: amazon.fr. Do a search. There are a few versions. Get the one released in Sept. 2004. I purchased it in Paris while on vacation in France, and the quality is quite good. It has the original English soundtrack. Subtitles are French, and can be turned off. One caveat: you need a multi-region player. With US exchange, it work out to a little over $20 plus shipping."
2,Low budget for what you're paying...,"First, if you're looking for it to write well alone then I'd give it 5 stars. The gel insert that it comes with is fantastic. I immediately ordered 10.Unfortunately the pen feels like a made in China giveaway, not a $100 pen. No, I wasn't expecting a Mont Blanc or anything, but I was expecting better quality.What specifically? The top feels thin and bends real easy, and because it's so thin it's sharp, I already have a wear line half way through the pen because I like to put the top on the back when I'm using it.The ""chrome"" looking pin on the side is plastic, and very cheap. Looks like it's coming off most the time.What would I have paid for this and been happy? $35"
4,Great introduction to greek mythology,"When I was a child I loved greek mythology, so when my daughter started taking a real interest in reading (more specifically having a bedtime story every night), I wanted an easy introduction to mythology. This book includes illustrations by Calef Brown, who authors some of the better children's poetry books, so it looks familiar to her. All in all, a great purchase if you're looking for an introduction to mythology and the stories behind some of the monsters your kid will see just watching TV."
1,hilarious,"Now that the Cold War is over, and the remaining communist nations are more entrepreneurial than the West, we can have fun reading this swill. Keep napkin handy for when you blow soda out your nose. Spoiler: Guess who the villains are? Eisenhower, Nixon, and Bush I! Madame Blavatsky, Sri Chinmoy, and Rahmat Ahmad, otherwise known as ""who?"" Marxists are satanists, according to this yo-yo. The World Bank logo looks just like a basketball, so I guess basketball is a satanic sport. And that UN convention on the Rights of the Child - ebil, I tells ya."
5,Should be mandatory reading for all Americans,"This book will surprise you with its revelations, such as - what do the current and all previous UN Secretary-Generals have in common? All are/were socialists or Marxists (without exception). Here's the straight scoop folks: the UN Charter and the US Constitution are incompatible with each other. Something is going to give. The main difference, as the book points out, is the source of 'rights'. Our Constitution recognizes and protects 'God given' rights. With the UN, rights are not absolute, and subject to any number of provisos. Get this book, read it (it's not too long), and encourage your friends/family to read it too. We needed to get out of the UN 'yesterday'."
3,Review of Latino Americano,I wanted this Cd for one particular tune (Love Potion No. 9) to which I want to teach a line dance. That tune is on the recording and is exactly what I wanted. But I do not find that the other songs on the Cd are to my musical taste.
5,Good Read,"I read the reviews before I read the book. I was apprehensive after reading the one review that wasn't so good but forged ahead. I'm glad I did. I understand some of the points they tried to make about the story but I also understand that the influence of ones environment can shape the way we think. In this case Dane had come from some pretty messed up situations as well as being wounded enough to have to step down from his law enforcement job. What he needed was the love of a good woman and that would be Tess. She had what it took. Just when she had about given up.... you'll have to read to find out what happens. But, for me I enjoyed it. It kept me turning pages until wee hours of the night. If you like Diana Palmer you would like this one."
4,Emotional Rollercoaster Ride,Character development and the layers of emotion were very well put in this book. I would recommend to anyone that loves Diana Palmer books.
3,The Case of the Mesmerized Boss,"Light read. Could read and watch TV at the same time. Will never be a ""classic"" but did enjoy enough to finish a a day and a half."
3,old tv history,I've just started to watch these but so far they are hard to watch because they are so old and the stories aren't that great. Nice to see some early performances on tv by Karloff-waiting for the Lugosi spot. The organ playing was annoying I would have preferred no live soundtrack! Hopefully they will get better but I'm not holding my breath.
4,First of several neo-western albums,"John Denver's love of the West is center-stage on this project, starting with a tribute to his new home in the Rockies, ""Starwood In Aspen."" This original version, with its mournfully sweet harmonica solo, is much more authentic than the somewhat over-produced rendition on the Greatest Hits album. There are several cuts with that same wide-open, solitary feel about them, so perfectly in keeping with the West itself. Standout tracks include ""Friends With You"", ""The Eagle & The Hawk"", and ""All Of My Memories."" I usually skip ""Re-adjustment Blues"", a Vietnam-era piece that has lost its relevance, and ""She Won't Let Me Fly Away"", another blues number that just doesn't appeal to me. Over all, a great album for camping or travelling."
2,"Fairly simple, somewhat sumptuous, not cheap","I'm on a restricted budget, so I bought this book hoping I could save some dough (money, not pastry).But instead of focusing on inexpensive staple foods (i.e.carrots, flour, chicken parts) prepared in flavorful ways,the authors have cobbled together a mismash of family menuswith frugality a low priority. In Minnesota, at least, endive, cornish game hens, and gorgonzola are not cheap.Some of the recipes are good... I like the spiced couscous with raisins and pine nuts and the tomato and cucumber salad with yogurt cream.The yellow rice and peas, however, ended up undercooked and the cheddar cheese biscuits were flat.Certainly, I regret spending my money on this substandard cookbook."
1,Boring,Didn't make it through chapter 5. Just imagine an 18th century SiFi story turning out to be a fantasy. Yikes.
4,Great Video - Well done,My baseball enthusiast son has watched this well over 100 times. Gives some great commentary and video to players he's only read about in books.
4,Very useful information in a variety of settings,"Asset-based analysis of communities can be used in working to fortify a variety of underfunctioning or dysfunctional environments. This approach to community building can also be applied to families, businesses, and government. The information is practical and well-organized for optimal understanding and use."
4,Great Item,This item was in great condition and looked as though it had hardly been used. This is a fantastic book for community workers and I can highly recommend it!Great transaction and efficient postage.
3,Not as good as CafeI,"Feels more like dance-electro then jazz. Some of the tunes are rough sounding, and the improvised skipping between tracks is annoying. You'll be happy with a used copy."
4,4.5 actually...,"This is a tremndous CD. If you are at all a fan of Jazz, or are looking for a good CD to hear what it is all about, I can recommend this one with haste. Quite frankly, every song on this CD is at least good, and most are exellent. I also enjoyed how the last beat of one song, is tied in with the first beat of the next song. To go with this, the order in which these songs are placed makes this effect work even better. The CD starts out with some instrumental, ""drummy"" beats with a blaring trumpet in the back, movies on to more upbeat vocal pieces, and then moves down to a somber conclusion. The whole thing is really 77 minutes of pure joy. The only reason I give it 4.5 stars is because a few of the tracks, while good, are lacking when placed in between the rest of the stellar tracks.Buy it, love it."
2,Supposedly open minded,"As I watched this I really felt like I was listening to anti-sex campaigners from the 50's and earlier. It sounded like a slightly more sophisticated version of those old anti-sex, anti-masturbation campaigns. This is NOT an opened minded look at sex or porn. It's more moralizing by the same kinds of people who were telling us that we should be mutilating our children's genitals to keep them from masturbating."
1,"Don't Waste Your Time, Just Go to Church","Correlation does not equal causation. This guy interviews Ph.d authors for the evidence that porn is ""as addictive as heroin"" and Ron Jeremy for the counterpoint. That isn't in the same hemisphere with a non-biased perspective. His scientific study comprises 3 people that were sexually awkward before he got there. Then sets the whole thing up to fail. Example: husband is to go to strip clubs once a week while his wife sits at home fuming that he's at strip clubs. Danger! Science Zone! My favorite quote was, ""not all porn addicts become rapists or molesters. Some just sexually harass women at work or disrespect women."" Yeah, its that biased. On the contrary: if you are a fundamentalist of any religion who is scared to death of the world outside your window, THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU!!!!"
3,"GREAT information, TERRIBLE layout","This is definitely the best, most comprehensive Tongan language book I've found. If you want to learn Tongan this is the first book I'd suggest. However, the layout and font are so terrible you should be prepared to have a love/hate relationship with this thing. The font looks like pages from a typewriter were photocopied, and the sections and exercises are just laid out poorly. There is often little or no spacing between paragraphs and different exercises. It can be confusing, but only briefly-- just long enough to be distracting from what is actually pretty great content."
1,Rip Off!,"We usually love Dreamcatcher games, but were really disappointed in this one, the one reason being that it won't play on our PC. You can find absolutely no help for this problem. The only thing we could find out is that some PCs will play it and others won't. We have kept this game hoping that Dreamcatcher would make a patch for this game. I think they owe it to the many people who have spent their hard earned money on this game to find that they can't play it. Save your money!"
1,Frustrating for XP Users,"If you have Win Xp do not buy this game,game will crash is not stable in XP it will not be worth the trouble. If you already have it :-( write an email to tech support describing your problem they will offer you a credit or you can exchange the game."
1,Ballroom dancing fan,"I agree with everyone above: this CD is truly awful. I would give it 0 stars if possible! It sounds cheap and ""thin,"" as though played with one finger on a toy electronic keyboard. If you like ballroom dancing at all, or music for that matter, DO NOT waste your money on this despicable recording."
1,Nothing sucks so bad.,"This album is a rip-off. Only a cheap electric organ with half of the keys in backwards could begin to imitate the obsecenities that ooze gracelessly from this total wast of time, money, effort, and expectation. It is Sooooo bad it is not even funny. I am embarrassed to have paid for it. Do not even think of buying this unless it is for someone you truly loath and despise. Instead, make noises through a used-up toilet paper tube. THIS SHOULD GET ZERO STARS."
2,I just didn't like it,hi well to start I didn't really like this book. I liked the sherlock holmes and the monsier piorot (Sorry if I spelled that wrong.) The inspector craigs were fun at first but then I really couldn't understand them. And I liked cold money that one was cool. Then the rest of them were duds. But I guess some people might like them. Well hope this was helpful Brooke
2,Rough around the edges,"The Treo 650 generall works, but is a collection of random software packages that were not designed cohesively, and it's still pretty buggy and unreliable.The number one problem with the device is the VersaMail e-mail program that will ocassionally crash and blow away all your e-mail and e-mail configurations. This is especially fun while you're on the road for business.When the device crashes hard, in some cases it can be put into a looping reboot that is not easily recoverable. The steps on the PalmOne support site instruct you to blow away all your data, then download a THIRD PARTY tool to go in an manually remove some databases, then reinstall all your data. This is unacceptable in a consumer device.Poor software quality and design makes the Treo 650 a hard device to rely on."
2,"just ok if you want a phone, good if you want a pda","For a phone, the only plus is the battery seems to last forever. The negatives are 1. Reception is worse than my 2yo $25 LG phone. Just driving around in an area where I never had a problem before, it would flicker and I lost 2 out of 5 calls, 2. Numeric keys are so small they are very very annoying for phone use.For a PDA, I'd rank it similar to a low-end palm compatible."
1,Never use spring pcs again,"1. You have to pre pay for a month of service and they are rude enough to refuse to prorate you last month service. You are definitely going to be ripped off on average of half month of your service fee. (about $45 for me, could be more)2. Check your statement. I found many errors in my bill and they put me on hold for 10 - 20 min each time depends on the time I call."
4,hmmm,"Not much of a review here so sorry. The phone is not out so its kind of hard to review. I get the feeling we are all a little bothered that the treo 650 is not much better then the treo 600. Very disapointed. Wanted to let people know that I am going to wait around a month or so for the ""Imate Jam"". Check it out. 1.3 camera, fast processor...Plus last I heard treo will be droping the palm os in future versions of the phone. Huge antenna. Crappy camera. Why!!"
4,Buy a good case!,"Great phone, but you really need to baby it. I had mine on a holster clip when I got into my car and the screen bumped the seatbelt post. Poof... All gone"
2,NOT WHAT YOU BARGAIN FOR,"THE CONCEPT OF THE PHONE AND ITS ABILITY IS GREAT BUT PALM JUSTCANNOT MAKE A RELIABLE PRODUCT. I HAD OLDER TREO REPLACED BY REMANUFACTURED ITEM 3 TIMES IN 18 MONTHS.FINALLY GAVE UP AND WAS TOLD THE 650 WAS MUCH BETTER. QUIT WORKING 31 DAYS AFTER PURCHASE. SPRINT REFUSED TO REPAIR OR REPLACE UNLESS THEY WERE PAID 85.00 OR GO TO TREO. FINE BUT TREO SAYS ITS SPRINT, SPRINT SAYS ITS TREO. APPARENTLY SPRINT HAD SUCH BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THE RELIABILITY OF TREO THEY QUIT WARRANTY AND YOU MUST PURCHASE INSURANCE IMMEDIATELY WITH IT OR""GOOD LUCK"""
3,Not perfect!?,"Simple to use for the first time buyer, has simple menu, easy to find everything, but doesn't have wi-fi, which could get perfect star rating for this smart device."
2,Beware of the hidden costs in a Treo 650,"Take note, as of Jan 1, 2006, Sprint is now charging to replace a broken/defective Treo 650 ( Even though you pay over $500 and the unit is under warranty!). I purchased the 650 in March 2005 and have had to replace the unit twice now. Problems include: headset port failure, rebooting while using the phone and calendar as well as very poor blue tooth support. Keep in mind, that the poor ""bluetooth "" support rules out using a bluetooth headset. And now in order to have your Treo 650 repaired, Sprint is requiring more $$s / month, in the form of a maint agreement. And on top of the maint agreement, beware that Sprint / Nextel has $$ deductibles on those fabulous agreements. But more importantly, we all just enjoy that ""Sprint service."" We look forward to spending hours of our plentiful ""spare time"" waiting in line at our favorite Sprint store...."
2,The phone already broke after 4 days,I'm a new Treo user. And I like the phone... the button are bigger. I wish it had voice dialing like my old Samsung i500... but after owning it for 4 days... the buttons jammed on my Treo already! Amazon has reacted quickly... but how can the phone already break... Right now the 2 button and the 5 button are jammed to the point that it won't let the phone dial. I hope my new Treo does not have the same problem. Anyone else face this?
3,treo NOOOOOOOO,"player resets once a week. drop calls. don't get what you pay for. don't recommend a hard reset, will lose all data."
2,Nice Try,Phones shouldn't crash losing all the data. Users shouldn't have to manage memory and application in consumer devices.Only buy this if you love spending time with gadgets instead of getting work done.
1,NOT RELIABLE - DO NOT BUY!!!,"I've had the Treo 650 for four days and I've missed over 50% of my incomming phone calls. Why? Because it reboots at random times all day.... it shuts off at random times all day... and it doesn't reboot with the phone enabled.Excellent.Add to that- The email linking is inconsistant - even with simple POP email accounts - The treo fails to connect over 50% of the time. What's the point???So I did some research. I grabbed the 1.08 OS patch from PALM... too bad it didn't fix anything.I'm returning the phone. It's the most expensive call blocker I've ever purchased. I've missed emergency phone calls becuase of it's flakey OS!!!This thing may look good on paper, but it doesn't actually function in person.Speaker phone is useless... Call Volume problems.... Buggy operation:BUYER BEWARE.-M"
5,I was a early adopter..,"And like some of the reviews it had it's issue's to begin with. The issue's were Roaming problems, People telling me that they couldn't understand what I was saying, the mail client not work, I guess thats about it.Well, about 2+ months ago sprint emailed me and gave me the instructions to upgrade my phone. BIG improvement!!! The voice improvement was so great people asked me if I got a new phone!! Th e mail client now works without a hitch. And the roaming now works with no issue's whatsoever.My only gripe now is that you still can't use the phone as a bluetooth modem, but I've gotten assurances that is coming.I love this phone, it truely is a fully packed PDA that also works as a great phone. I recommend this phone 5+ Stars!!"
1,Quality Control Unknown At PalmOne,Let me give anyone thinking of buying product from PalmOne some good advice. Seriously consider what you are getting into. The company rushes product to market and does not put enough quality control into place. I had the Treo 300 and 600. I experienced quality issues with both devices. I am reading other reviews here on Amazon and I am seeing a trend to the same effect with the 650. I went through 4 Treo 300's and SEVEN Treo 600's. Ask anyone you may see on the street about their experience with it. If they give a positive response your follow up question should be asking them how long they have owned it. This junk distributor of a company sells product that lasts maybe 60 days at the most before it starts having problems. I seriously think they should be investigated[...]
4,Service,The service with this seller was great however my book did not arrive. They issued a complete refund and were excellent in their communication. Sorry I can't tell you anything about the book though!
3,Wild Girls,I don't feel like this book offered anything more to the knowledge base than what was already written in Wild Hearts.
2,Adrift,"Probably the silliest attempt at biography I have ever read. Souhami drifts among dozens of interesting women as though she was at a buffet table. A taste of this and that. In between are uninteresting ""discursions"" into her own chaotic love life ( I guess). Affairs are all she has in common with the likes of Gertrude Stein and Romaine Brooks. They have proved their art, not she."
3,Early music aficionada's dream....errr...nightmare!,"One of the funniest albums I have ever heard. I didn't much care for Black Sabbath's music in the original, but Rondellus have done a wonderful job turning it into good...if...ah...different early music. And what a hoot to see the lyrics in Latin! Might also rate as a Latin teacher's dream. Way better than teaching kids with Winnie ille Pooh.I liked it, even without the humorous aspects, and I have already recommended it to friends."
2,A good idea badly executed,"The idea of giving classic Sabbath tunes the Blakmore's Night treatment does look good on paper. Unfortunately, the creators decided to rewrite the lyrics using OLD English! I don't mean Shakespere- I mean Beowulf! There is no reason they couldn't use the words we all know n love. This is too bad since the takes of ""national accrobat"" and ""planet caravan"" are good musically. Now, the novelty wears thin after the first track- not good for a 50+ minute CD. (Also, nothing for the Dio period is used- and those songs already border on Rennesance music.)"
4,Awesome!,"As an avid gamer I'm always hesitant about licensed games but the Simpsons fan in me overrode my common sense, and thank god it did. While the game falls under fairly traditional platform game fair the puzzles are actually really well thought out. Using the two characters available to you per level you will be tasked with harnessing each member of the Simpsons family skills to advance. Something I found to be a lot of fun on my own but quickly became extra awesome with a friend. The comedy is spot on and all of the voice actors loan their talents to make the game feel like an episode of the TV show. The only major gripe I have is the typical platform game camera that rarely points in the right direction without your hands on control. Definitely worth the d'oh!"
2,Very Disappointing,I tried playing this game twice and will probably never go back to it. The controls and the camera are very sloppy and amateurish. Pointing out 'cliche' gameplay doesn't make it any better; it's still fairly boring. Maybe later levels would be better but I just cannot be bothered playing to them. I thought Hit 'n' Run a much better game.
3,d'oh!,"Look, I love the Simpsons. I've been watching it for over 19 years now. I've been playing their games since the early 90s on the NES and playing games like ""Bart vs. the Space Mutants"". The games are really not that good. The game companies just milk and overkill the Simpsons name in an attempt to make money. It happens all the time with other games as well. This game has some positive things going for it such as really spectacular graphics and some fun puzzle games, but don't expect the game to stand the test of time. That's the difference between the animated comedy we see every Sunday night and the video games. The TV show rules, the games don't."
3,not so good simpsons,"This game is extremely hard at the beginning and very hard to follow through the first part of the chocolate scenario, I haven't played the whole game yet, but from the outset it appears to be very hard,this makes it unenjoyable to a certain extent and not so anxious to get back to play it.The instruction booklet that comes with it is of no use to get started in the game, and isn't that informative anyway about anything else.The other simpson games were much much better, this game in no way resembles them or is going to be much fun to play,it's a whole different thing,and rather disappointing."
2,"Good, but could be better","This game is fun and the humor is pretty good. There are references to the show itself, and I truly do enjoy Comic Book Guy's numerous cliches.The problem with this game, as others have indicated in their reviews, is the gameplay. I've never played a game where the camera angle is the biggest obstacle in the game, but that is the case here. It's a struggle to get the view you need to accomplish certain tasks. Then when you do, it can change on you by itself while you are in the middle of some critical action.Bottom line, it's a good game that could be great if the designers just cleaned up the gameplay. That's always the most important part of any game."
2,Simpsons game kinda lame,"This game is fun at first for Simpson's fans, but then it's really overkill with the annoying anti intuitive ""puzzles"" thru-out the game. I really like games of this type that are simple, yet with variety. Also, the video angles are annoying & if you step out of place, you can't see where you're trying to go!"
3,"""Pretty Addicting""","I'm a bit of a simpsons fan. After playing this game I admit it was pretty addicting,however I think it is very hard to figure out.You can play the simpsons family in gaming levels for example Zelda and metal of homer. overall one of my fav. games."
2,not so good,"this game is too hard, so i took it back to gamestop, the camera doesn't work good, so you can't manuver through the levels any good, and i don't reccomend it, it was a huge let down. only lasted a few hours."
2,"Funny Show, bad game","The game plays like a Dreamcast title from early this decade. Terrible camera with sluggish, non-responsive controls and bad even for a PS2 graphics. Other than the vignettes between levels, there is nothing to recommend this game."
2,para fanaticos,"este juego es solo para fanaticos de la serie ya que es un mal juego, tiene malas graficas,los movimientos de los personajes son monotonos y pesados,el juego es muy corto y la camara es pesima."
3,Decent,"This game isn't too bad. Most of the challenges involve a pair of the Simpsons family solving puzzles in a 3D environment (i.e. climbing a tower, using Homer to throw Bart with a see-saw, etc). I'm only two hours into the game, but it is fun and the TV show references are numerous. Just hoping it is more than ""solve this obstacle"" every level. We'll see..."
2,Horrible mixes,"The radio version is really nice and funny, but the remixes are awful especially #5, 6 and 7If you listen to the single twice you are fed up for the next three years"
4,Wife was very happy.,"We had a Doors weekend of music and video, very cool stuff. I wish there was more visuals to accompany the music playback from the DVDs."
4,Can I listen to DVDAudio in 2 channel and still get the DVDAsound,"I'm at a loss as to whether I can listen to DVDAudio and SACD in stereo and still get the sound benefits of those formats. I'm only set up for 2 channel but I love the warmth in sound that the formats offer. I do have a ""universal"" player."
3,MIS-PERCEPTION,"THE ANTICIPATION FOR 5.1 MIXES OF ALL DOORS STUDIO ALBUMS HAD TO BE HIGH FOR FANS OF THE DOORS AND SURROUND ENTHUSIASTS. AS IT TURNS OUT, MOST OF THE SURROUND EFFECT IS NEGLIGIBLE, PARTICULARLY ON THE FIRST TWO DOORS RELEASES ALTHOUGH NOT MUCH AUDIO GEOGRAPHY IS AVAILABLE FOR NAVIGATION (GUITAR,BASS, DRUM KIT). THE LATER DISCS ADD SOME FULLER ORCHESTRATION, BUT NOTHING THAT REGULAR STEREO PLAYED THROUGH SOUND PROCESSING COULDN'T ENHANCE ON INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCE. A MAJOR GRIPE: WHO STUFFS THE CD BOOKLETS INTO THE TRI-FOLD CARDBOARD DISC SLEEVES? EACH OF MY BOOKLETS WAS CREASED, MANGLED, AND MAN-HANDLED. I ASSUME THE PACKAGING WAS HANDLED BY THE RESIDENTS OF THE CHIMP CAGE AT THE COLUMBUS ZOO."
3,The Doors: Redundancy,"When I reviewed this product, I thought to myself 6CD/6DVD boxset. This has to have a lot of stuff that I have not heard or seen before. So I spent the money. I was also considering The Doors Complete Box Set, but it was a little more. Unfortunately, this boxset's CD's have some different versions of their songs, but I found them more redundant than refreshing. As far as the DVD's go I was also hoping for more LIVE performances and unseen footage.This too was a bit disappointing."
5,Missing booklet?,My copy of Morrison Hotel from this box set does not contain a booklet while all the other cd/dvd's contain a booklet. Should Morrison Hotel contain a booklet?
2,Redundant,"Any ""complete"" Doors release that doesn't include the two non Morrison albums and an American Prayer is NOT complete. Suspect that the remaining living members will get around to tapping this last remaining possible source of revenue soon.I can go without this one. If you deciding between this one and the '99 box set it's a no brainer. Same music for 50 % the dollars (for you Doors fans approaching social security.)"
1,Because of the price,"The price is ridiculous. I own these albums already from the 99 box set. I can understand $80 dollars, but not $120? Even if it's a dvd and cd, it's still only six albums."
5,"""A must have for Doors fans everywhere""","Hats off to Rhino Records for putting together a box set that truly does this legendary group justice-You get all six of the band's studio releases:""The Doors"" (1967) ""Strange Days"" (1967) ""Waiting For The Sun"" (1968),""The Soft Parade"" (1969),""Morrison Hotel"" (1970) & ""L.A.Woman"" (1971)-Each of the CD packages contains a bonus DVD of the group performing their material in various venues-Whoever did the audio remastering deserves to be commended-The sound on the individual CD's is far superior to that of the original LP's-If you're looking to upgrade your Doors collection,toss out those worn out LP's & purchase ""Perception""-It's money well spent."
5,Great box set,"If you are a Doors fan/lover, then this box set will easily satisfy you. I do prefer some of their other versions to some songs, but most everything else was right on. It was worth the price, and Amazon did a great job on the gift wrap. It was a memorable birthday present for my girlfriend, and even better for me since she moved in. Now we share this great Doors collection."
5,Love The Doors,I can't get enough of the Doors even after all these years. The Perception boxset if just awesome.
1,Beware-Production Snafu in High Res Surround!!!,"Amazingly, there is no signal being sent to my Polk subwoofer in Advanced Resolution Surround on my discs. The subwoofer does not even indicate a signal being received in this format at all. In stereo Advanced Res, it comes booming through perfectly and also in the digital DTS 5.1 format. So all is not a complete loss, but I did pay for the rush of high res surround. This is the only DVD-Audio I have ever experienced this with, have a Denon player and brand new Pioneer receiver. Obviously some kind of quality control snafu is present."
1,Incomplete,"once again the band/record company passes off a Doors product and calls it ""complete"".where are the two excellent post-Morrison studio albums ""Other Voices"" and ""Full Circle""? why oh why are these always ignored? maybe they didnt sell well in 71-72 but that doesnt mean they dont deserve to see the light of day. you have to go on ebay and buy a russian import to get them on cd.dont get me wrong, the doors are a six star rated band out of five ... the greatest american rock group of all time. but they deserve, and us dedicated fans, deserve better.""we want the world and we want it....NOW"""
5,UNBELIEVABLE doors collection!,"i cannot express enough HOW MUCH my husband LOVES this box set of the doors!!!! oh man, he thanked me a million times. it is not cheap, but worth EVERY penny! you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED with this. it makes a great addition to your own AUDIO and DVD collection and also makes a great gift. there are not enough hours in a day for him to sit and enjoy this enough!! he hates to go to bed and shut it off."
4,"Not perfect, but pretty good","For those who do not have a complete set of remastered Doors studio albums, this set is probably worth it if you find it at the right price (don't pay the full price). Packaging is creative, booklets are well written and the digipacks themselves are sturdy and well-designed. Two minor gripes, however: (a) the 5.1 surround mixes make much less use of the back channels than other relatively recent 5.1 releases, e,g., Queen ""Night at the Opera"", or anything from the 3 Genesis retrospective box sets - however, I do consider the source here; (b) it would have been nice if the set had included a live disc of some sort. That's it, otherwise - overall, I'd recommend this."
5,Absolutely worth the price and effort in getting this box set,"Yes even having to pay the full price from Amazon (and not setling for a second-hand used item at a much lower price), it was definitely worth paying and waiting for this box set to arrive all the way to Japan. Highly recommended for all Doors Fans!!"
4,Full of great tips,Very informative and easy to read. Provided a lot of answers to questions and concerns I had. Now if only it would file my taxes for me.
5,Incredible Wealth of Business Start-up Info,"As a business owner of over 25 years, you would think that a person would already know the ropes.Firstly, I am a huge fan of the vast information Nolo provides in their incredible line-up of topics.Second, I'm very glad I picked up this updated book for my business library, it's been a great help so far in re-evaluating our current business structure.Mr. Fishman is very insightful in this manual and tackles many important issues when setting up your business and is current as of 2011.Although each state has it's own regulations for business and may vary, these are the essentials to get you on the right track to success.Their are alot of business books out there, and this is one of the better choices, in my opinion."
4,Very handy reference tool,"I was very pleased to read this reference tool, as it gave insight and excellent examples for the independent contractor. With many consumers working from home and starting virtual businesses, Working for Yourself: Law & Taxes for Independent Contractors, Freelancers & Consultants, is a book that needs to be close by at all times.After reading this book, I feel very confident about the ins and outs of starting a small business and how to draft and meet contractual obligations. The human resources and financial aspects of a business can be very complicated, so this book breaks things down in a very understandable format.I would recommend this book to anyone starting their own business."
4,"As ever, Nolo to the rescue","As with my past Nolo Press experiences, clear, concise and highly valuable.I used this in conjunction with a large number of other business books in setting up my new sole proprietorship this year. I found it to be the best organized - with a helpful index - and to have that heavenly, difficult combination of complete and concise which is a delight in reference material."
5,Most of what you need to be in business for yourself...,"A very good book for Independant Contractors, Freelancers, and Consultants selling thier services BUT not for small businesses selling goods. It covers all the legal and tax basics self-employed people need to know.WARNING: This book is intended only for those self-employed people who provide personal services, such as: writers, consultants, artists, photographers, doctors, and lawyers. If your business involves selling goods (rather than services) to the public, this book is not for you.Instead, you should refer to ""Legal Guide for Starting & Running a Small Business"" by Fred Steingold [Nolo]."
5,For Everyone Who Makes Their Money Without a Paycheck,"NOLO Press delivers again! ""Working for Yourself: Law & Taxes for Independent Contractors, Freelancers & Consultants"" is an essential book for anyone that earns a living without collecting a weekly paycheck. When you work for yourself, you are responsible for many things that the average employee of a company never think about and the employer does for them; when you work for yourself, you have legal issues you must consider and tax ramifications to be aware of.This book delivers on all the legal and tax aspects of being an independent contractor from setup and organization of your new freelance business through day-to-day operations. This book would also be a useful tools for anyone starting a small business."
4,Very good book for basics,"THis is a good up-to-date reference on a wide range of topics relevant to small business operations. It has substantial sections on dealing with govt regs, record keeping, employer-employee relations and general business operations. No book will have it ""all"", and so this book does not attempt to cover marketing or public relations. However, there is a good-sized section at the end titled ""Help Beyond This Book"", and that in itself is invaluable because it sources further reading both online and hard copy that will further enhance the information that is included in the book."
2,BAD BOTTOM DESIGN!,"Pros: The smaller pots work alright and the lids are very solid.Cons: The large pot and the pan has an ugly problem with its bottom design. It is NOT flat so it will bulge when you use it the stove and it will rattle until its up to the heat of the stove top. The whole time while its heating up, the pot/pan will be heated ONlY in the center, leaving a gap about 1/8 inch untouch to the surface. Once its hot enough then the whole bottom will drop flat onto the stove surface. BAD DESIGN FLAW! NOT BUYING THESE AGAIN!"
3,Don't be fooled!,"Although the content of the book is as good as described in the reviews, I was disappointed to discover that it is NOT hard cover. It is spiral bound with a very thin paperboard cover, then comes in a paperboard ""storage box"" the consistency of a cereal box. It may survive a year with me before the cover is bent and torn and the pages start falling out. For the price, my expectations were higher."
5,One of the great DO Woop balladeers.,Ivory Joes Hunters music was a pioneer back when music by black artists was downplayed.
5,BBMAK ROX... AGAIN!!!,"in my opinion, BBMak hasn't written or sung a bad song on either of their CDs. all of their songs r catchy and TOTALLY KICK (...)_AWESOME!!! their new CD is just as good if not better than the 1st. you could play either of their CDs over and over again and never get tired of them. i strongly recommend u buy this CD and if u don't already have the 1st one... get it!!! u won't b dissapointed!!! it even has the music video 4 out of my heart which is an awesome song and the music video's even better this CD totally rox and its definatly worth while 2 buy!!!!!"
4,Don't overlook this album,"BBMak may have been looked at in the same light as the Backstreet Boys and 'N SYNC when they first came out, but this album separates them from the pack. ""Into Your Head"" is catchy and even though it won't sell many copies or have singles that are huge on the radio, it's a good effort from the boys across the pond.The highlights are ""Out of My Heart,"" ""She's Everything,"" ""Run Away,"" ""Sympathy,"" and ""The Beginning.""BBMak is not your typical boyband. They play their own instruments and write most of their music, and not just lyrics. Tell 'N SYNC to try that on for size."
1,Certainly Different,"After a first listen of this album, it's very clear that they sound different, well, not in a good way. It was as if I was listening to a different band, again, not in a good way.To sum up this album, it was like 80's pop band trying with rock elements while blinded. Sound is boring. Despite bitter criticism about their first album, I think they had a good thing going with their sound and voices created a good harmony that no other bands were not capable of. Rather than buidling on their foundation, they decided that they wanted a different foundation, and it's very weak. Guiter driven sound does not match the voices of 3 singers. By the way, harmony of these singers are not good either. Everything is a mismatch. I was hopeful, but very disappointed with their desparate attempt to sound more ""rock."" It just didn't work for me."
2,Not As Good As Last,"Please don't take this the wrong way, I'm not dissing bbmak or anything, this is just constructive criticism!I have Sooner or Later and I thought it was excellent, and Out of My Heart sounded great too, so I got the CD. It wasn't what I expected to say the least. On most of the songs the music was so loud that you couldn't even hear what the guys are singing, and the songs all sounded basically the same. I think they've gone more acoustic with this album, if that's the correct word. They're probably changing their sound from pop to a beatles like thing, in which case Out of My Heart sound out of place as the only poppy song on the album, and you'd wonder why they released that as the first single if they didn't want to market themselves as a pop group. Also, Into Your Head's missing all those great ballads, like the Ghost of You and Me. And the album's pretty short too.In short, buy the first album, don't buy this! ..."
2,"Too short, completely skips test analysis","I quote:""This section will not show you how to do an item analysis because computer programs do this extremely well on most personal computers.""Completely skips on how to analyze test questions, not even basic stuff like reliability.So he is expecting us to purchase an old software tool for $300 to do something that can be done easily in a spreadsheet or regular statistical program (such as R or SPSS).Not worth buying."
4,About Baghdad,"This movie was very moving to me. The people of Iraq have spoken out about the changes that have taken place since the American's arrived in Baghdad, and the fall of Saddam Hussien's regime. Both positive feedback and negative feedback was exchanged between them. Iraqi's are still struggling to find peace in their homelands and hope to find a happy medium."
4,I wouldn't have had the courage,"Sometime in the early Twenties, two nice girls from New England and a 1918 Model T Ford named Henrietta set off from Boston: destination Los Angeles, aim adventure. They achieve both. Heading west, they take the northern route, visiting Yellowstone and the Pacific Northwest before turning south to California. Returning, they visit the Navajo and Hopi Reservations, Santa Fe and Taos, then head for St. Louis. They then turn south and travel partially by riverboat to New Orleans. A good read."
1,Not as pictured,"The hole alignment is horizontal, not vertical as pictured. Would have worked for the top if the item matched the picture."
1,Don't purchase,Product pictured is not product shipped. Bolt orientation is wrong. Hinge does not fit.Picture shows bolt holes perpendicular to hinge- product has holes parallel to hinge.
1,Item does not match the picture,"Like the other review said, the shipped hinge set does not match what is pictured by the seller. The mounting holes are side to side instead of the pictured lengthwise. Will not work on a standard Bemis toilet seat/lid unless you're willing to drill new holes. Scheduling this for a return/refund."
5,This is a gem!,"I bought this CD on a whim; I thought its ""Raga meets Enya"" style might be appealing. And, gosh, was I right! Please ignore Amazon.com's over the top negative review of this album. I reacted similarly to the disk the first time I heard it. But this is one that really rewards repeated listening. Those familiar with filmi music might find that Sheetal's music bears some resemblance to that of A.R. Rahman."
2,Not really my taste,"Let me point out that this is NOT a bad review. The music just didn't appeal to me, personally. Some of my friends really liked the ""zenness"" of music (even gave one of them the CD) and her voice is quite unique. I was just hoping for something different, just don't know what. When I listened to this CD, I felt like I was in one of those new-age cafe lounges, again nothing wrong with that just not my cup of tea."
5,ONE OF THE BEST DEATHMETAL CD THIS YEAR,"insision is the next suffocation boys anyway very heavy and very loud so fans of deicide, grave and maybe oh centurion will love this SFM buy now"
3,Not bad,"When Hollywood Videos were closing here in Abq I bought this movie. There wasn't many movies left to choose from. I had different thoughts about this movie when I bought it, but I guess it wasn't bad."
1,We Abandoned Grandpa,"This is the first book by Truman Capote that I've read, and I can see that he is a good writer. The book is well written and evokes lovely images of place and time. However, the story is awful, and put me in a bad mood for the entire day. **SPOILER ALERT** The beginning of the story is fine, but in the end, the family completely abandons the old man, leaving him to live with strangers. They never go back to visit, not even after Grandma dies and Grandpa writes to say he's all alone, doesn't know what to do, and wishes he'd died too. They don't keep in touch, and a few short years later, their son has all but forgotten his grandfather. It is heart-wrenching, not heartwarming."
5,A Great Movie And A Great DVD,"I have many favorite movies, but Meet Me In St. Louis is the one that I watch most often. This particular film is very special. It packs a lot of great entertainment in one production. It is a musical, a comedy, a love story, and a nostalgic look at simpler times. Few movies can be all these things and be so wonderful as each.My favorite character in the film is that of little Tootie (Margaret O'Brien). She adds a depth of mischievous fun to this movie. It's hilarious listening to her lines and trying to imagine anyone actually behaving in that manor (especially at her age). Truly funny!Yes, this movie is fantastic. I won't spoil the movie but will say that the transfer to DVD is incredible. I could not have asked for a better DVD package. The movie is clear and the extras are fun."
5,Five Star Bonanza,"This digitizing of a film Blockbuster is perfect in every way. While plot seems a little shallow, the entertainment value of the production cannot be denied. Anyone watching this movie will be removed from the day to day stresses and come away happier. There may be some insight into a bygone generation as well."
5,Three Cheers for Meet Me In Saint Louis!,"Meet Me in St. Louis is one of the best films I have ever seen. There are many memorable songs that just make you want to sing along! The plot is relatively funny and Judy Garland hits home. Margaret O'Brien, who plays 'Tootie' is so adorable. She is exceptional in the part and knows how to adjust to serious scenes very well. Over all, this is a swell movie and I would recommend it to any musical fan."
4,"Bought this to share with my grandchildren. They loved it, esepcially Margaret O'Brien.",I got it for Halloween because there is a really neat scene where Margaret O'Brien goes out to play tricks on neighbors. She was about 6 at the time. A really great little actress.
1,Dead Zones in the Sound Track,"Love the movie but it turns into a silent flick on several occasions, including the movie's signature song (the Trolley Song) sung by Judy Garland. Curiously, I can hear the song--in English--by switching to the French version of the soundtrack (the Spanish version dubs everything). Amazon was very good about replacing it but the replacement Blu-ray disc had the same problem. Do not buy this movie in Blu-ray until Warner Video fixes this problem."
4,Meet me in St Louis,"I liked the movie very much, the shipping was on time if not a couple of day earlier"
2,Why can't I hear the vocals during the musical numbers?,"I love the picture quality. The color and grain are perfect for my taste. But I'm having a huge problem with the musical numbers. The soundtrack is fine during the dialogue, but as soon as a musical number starts, the vocals drop. I have tried every single sound channel, and this doesn't fix it. I have the sound coming from the tv as I can't afford a sound system at the moment. I've even tried changing the sound on the tv. Any ideas? I tried contacting Warner Home Video months and months ago, but they have never responded."
3,good product,glad to find this hard to find movie. the quality is good and it shipped very quickly and arrived in plenty of time.
5,"Great movie, great purchase","Very happy with our purchase! We saw it on TV recently and decided to buy the DVD. It is nice that it comes with the bonus info too, altho we haven't watched that part yet. But we are very happy with the movie, thanks!"
1,DVD does not play - Region 2,"What a disappointment! I was so excited to watch this film, however it is for Region 2 and will not play on my DVD player."
1,Not the same,"They completely took a good classic play, and turned it upside-down, pulling out such classic songs as ""Whenever I'm With You"", and ""The Banjo"". They also rewrote too much of the play for judy garland."
1,Over-rated,"Such an adorable little girl, it's just so cute how she goes round assaulting and abusing defenceless old men, and almost derailing trolleys, nearly murdering hundreds of innocent pedestrians - ahhhhh... the good old days.Quite possibly sowed the early seeds for today's abundance of youth crime and lack of discipline in society.Charming and quaint it is not.Tedious, oversentimental nostalgia with frankly appalling clothes (who would really wear that bow?) and bangs from the devil."
1,The audio sounds like a counterfeit knock-off,"Arrived on time and well packed. The picture is okay--a little grainy--but the sound is terrible. It sounds like it was recorded by holding a microphone in front of a TV, and it has a strange tinny sound. It is basically unusable. It's our Christmas tradition to watch this film so we ended up getting our old video player out of storage and watching a VHS tape of the movie instead."
4,AMONG THE BEST OF AMERICAN MUSICALS,"Vincent Minelli's beloved heartland American film gets the Blu-ray treatment in a stunning transfer of this true musical classic. For those few who don't know, Judy Garland is Esther Smith, who pines for the boy next door (Tom Drake) in this wonderful tale about the trials and tribulations of a close-knit St. Louis family on the eve of the 1904 World's Fair. This is the one with ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" and ""The Trolley Song."" If you like American musicals, this is one of the very best."
5,Beautiful clothes but.....,"People actually WANT to wear those corsets? That is the part that shocks most of my friends that I have introduced the movie to, if only for health reasons. It just shows fasion victims have been around for ages.I love everything about this movie; the singing, the dancing, the acting, the way the ladies in the family manipulate poor old Mr Smith. Another comment that I have had is about how the kids are allowed out onto the streets unsupervised at night (oh for our lost innocence). Buy it, Watch it. Love it."
4,One of Judy's best pictures!,"This film can be watched over and over and never loses its appeal. (I have a copy of the anniversary edition in VHS which was released a few years ago, but do I wish they would release this in DVD!) Judy's song ""Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" is beautifully performed. This is a musical that should be in everyone's video library."
5,Meet Me in St Louis (1944),"Mid-October through the Christmas Holiday's we never seem to watch TV. But are DVD player is going most of the day.My daughter and I loved this addition to our Christmas Holiday collection. I only wish I had ordered the DVD...a slip up on my part somehow.Anyway, it is a great holiday classic and a treat for the whole family."
5,Love this movie! <3,Such a great family movie! I grew up watching this with my mom and sister when we were little. We would watch it every year around Christmas time along with White Christmas. I bought this from Amazon at such a deal! I am VERY happy with my purchase and I have already watched it twice! Amazon has never let me down!
3,region 2 meet me in st. louis,"Hi, This item didn't work in my DVD player. However, I found customer service to be responsive and easy to work with on the return process."
1,SHORT SHEETED AGAIN: MEET ME IN ST LOUIS BLU RAY,"This is a joke, right? We have heard the virtues of blu ray capacity ad nauseam, so what's up with the growing practice to present in a fancy package what is really a bare-bones release. It's sheer abuse. I already own the Two-Disc Edition of this movie, an upgrade to my previous copy which is packed with extras. So what excuse can be offered for the failure to include them on the blu ray. Unlike my shelves, it is not so limited in space, so that's not the problem. It can't be the cost of producing them since it's just a question of including all those from the previous release. This would allow folks lkie myself to divest ourselves of previous copies and maximize that already menitoned limited shelf space. But no- WB would rather milk it for all its worth releasing this making their money and once more release a2nd blu ray with the extrasscrewing the public again.THey can go to blazes. I'll spend my money on more generous offerings from someone else."
1,unable to view,I cannot see this DVD on my television. It is a Region 2. I have written to Amazon and the store that filled the order to return this DVD in exchange for one that will work but have had no response. I am unhappy with the service of Amazon.
5,This is the best!!,"This is movie is in my top 5 all time favorites! So much fun for the whole family. If you even know who Judy Garland was, you must have this movie. The cast is great, the story wonderful, and the singing a joy!"
5,Excellent DVD!!!,"I almost paid $59 for this DVD at Best Buy!?!? But when I searched on Amazon and got it for $9 and free shipping! It was a deal I could not resist! Amazon is the best place to go and find those hard to get movies, at super low prices."
1,audio dropouts,"Like some other reviewers I encountered a problem with audio dropouts. These dropouts occur during most of the songs, such that the soloist singers are not audible. The problem is due to the operation of the Blu-ray player: mine is a Samsung BD-P3600. I found that the problem seems to be related to the digital conversion from bitstream to PCM. When I reconfigured the player to use the Bitstream (audiophile) digital output rather than PCM the dropout problem was solved. Note that this solution requires one to use a receiver that that can decode DTS-HD Master Audio."
5,A must-have Family Movie,"Meet Me in St Louis has to be my favourite Judy Garland film. I'm so glad that it is on DVD after all this time! The film really is a pure joy to watch for all ages. The special features on this DVD still amaze me - especially the short film ""Bubbles"" which is a rare opportunity to see Judy Garland at age 7. The only thing that disappointed me a little is the quality of the film - I can't tell the difference between this DVD version and my VHS version. Definitely a must have DVD."
3,not as good as I remembered,"I watched this movie all the way thru for the first time on TCM. I then put it on my list of must-have dvds. Well, I bought it and watched it beginning to end. Am I the only one who thinks the character of Tootie is slightly hysterical (re, the crying jag that precedes her beheading the snowpeople)? Kind of weird. Maybe I think this because she was playing a brat and was doing a good job of being really irritating, as brats will. Anyway, Judy Garland is terrific....as is Mary Astor, one of the greatest actresses ever; too underappreciated generally."
2,"dvd scratched during my favorite part, the trolly ride","I love this musical and know all the songs by heart. I care for my 100 year old grandmother and I can honestly say that this is her most requested movie,we have watched it up to 3 times a week.Her VHS copy got ruined sso I turned to a DVD version. Was so dissapointed to get the dvd and find out that th whole trolly song is scratched! This is the best part of the movie! Funny....I ordered a ""new"" dvd....."
3,good group,"i always like richie,thats why i bought it.but LAZAFRA is the only good song and good video the others ???????"
1,Dont buy. Has expired codes.,"Don't buy these cards! NCSoft has marked these cards as expired despite the claim that any NCSoft time card can be used to add time to any NCSoft game. Even if you claim that you used it in the past, it doesn't work anymore. I suggest to be careful about older NCSoft time cards as well, since those may be expired too."
3,Color isn't red--is burnt orange,"I was very disappointed when I opened box to find the 'red' lacquer peppermill was not 'red' but was burnt orange in color--so, I returned item."
4,"Top of the ""Beautiful Music"" Heap","This CD has a nice collection of Mantovani's work. The combination of older standards with ""newer"" (such as Stevie Wonder's ""For Once In My Life"")is great. This is the stuff that is usually mocked as ""elevator music"" but also considered by many good romancing background music. Many of these arrangements were heard on a local Beautiful Music FM station where I live before the format change. The only negative I have is for a ""box set"" there is no write-up on the Orchestra. It would have been nice to read about Mantovani and what inspired his arrangements, and the orchestra personnell. My copy was made in Canada by Madacy. Maybe someone who has contact with that company could recommend a booklet for any future copies made."
2,"My favorite scent, but this one seems like a watered down version of D&G for Men","I absolute love this cologne, but this one purchased by Amazon.com smells like a watered down version of D&G for men. The packaging looks legit, the box, the bottle, and the scent smells like a watered down version of this cologne, and it doesn't linger like my husband's old bottle that was purchased at a department store."
3,Good but not great,"I recently bought this men's fragrance based on reviews and value. I was not completely disappointed, but do feel it's over rated. I like the Light Blue better, but even it will be used for day time use, and informal gatherings.As far as this product goes, I've given it away after using it one time, and will probably stay with some of my other favorites.Everyone has their own taste, and fragrances do smell differently on different people. Armani seems to suit me well as do a few others, but this fragrance just was not a good choice for me, it might work well for you.In my opinion it's good cologne but not great."
1,rip off,I received a watered down version of a cologne I have worn for years. This is the type of product and vendor that will ruin web shopping.
2,Very Poor Staying Power,"I have been using D&G; Pour Homme and have found it thoroughly disappointing. I like the fragrance. The top note of citrus, Bergamot and neuroline are pleasant but that is where the story ends. The Heart and the base note does not seem to exist. The perfume does not have a lasting power. After a couple of hours the fragrance is gone, at least for me. I was expecting a lot more from this perfume in terms of its staying power. Where are the sandalwood, tonka bean base notes ? Did they forget to add it to the batch that I purchased ?? Don't know.Hence giving it a two star."
1,Completely fake,Buyer Beware: This is a fake item. I compared this to the real item and there is a night and day difference in longeivity. This one fades in 30 minutes and also smells slightly different. Upon reading the reviews it is clear that others have received a fake version too. Shame on amazon for allowing a crrok to sell products on its site.
4,great very nice smell to it,Let me start by saying every time i wear this scent i get compliments everytime. The women love this its sort of fruity and musky mixed so it gets their senses going wild. This is a little pricey but if you are trying to impress a woman id go for it.
1,Poor packing,The bottle broken and the liquid is pouredI want to returnI dislike this productI can not use because it arrived brokenwet Box
1,The product is a knock off,I bought this as a gift for my husband. Upon wearing it we noticed that it had a musk smell instead of the fresh scent it normally has. I do not recommend this seller.
3,"Very good, but it's a weak scent","I bought this perfume before, but this time I thought the scent very weak. But the quality of fragancy is very sweet and the womens love it."
2,not worth dissapointing,"I really wanted this perfume for a long time, my girl friend gave me as a present.But i was very disappointed with this because it lacks longetivity and i dont quite like the way it smells...definitely not for me....."
4,"Item Great, But Illegally Being Sold","I just received a 4.5ml (0.15 fl. oz.) bottle of the ""Dolce & Gabbana Pour Homme"" cologne. Although I love the fragrance, I was concerned to read, on the back of the box, that this is a promotional sample, clearly marked ""FREE SAMPLE * NOT FOR SALE."" I have alerted Proctor & Gamble -- but buyer beware!"
4,"Good fragance, good value","I've been using this fragrance since 98 (not continuously, of course). In my opinion it's a little overpriced for its ""age"". But stills a good value for me."
1,Dolce demand must have made them cut corners...,"I can remember the smell of my pre-school classroom, Mrs Bell....the school yard aid(moth balls..lol)and the thick colored wooden blocks (carmel/sweet) I would chew on when I was just 3 years old. Humans never forget a scent. I remember the smell my grandmothers purse, my sisters hair oil, burning fireworks, black shoe polish, Ajax, inside an M-16 A2 and even death.I do not know what is inside this bottle.I have never smelled it before. No memory comes to mind except; of a little girl who rang my door bell, selling knock-off cologne. She only need to squirt a sample in the air for me to decline. Smelled like fresh scented roach spray or something. : (I will never in life buy cologne on-line."
3,May I have the pleasure of this waltz?,"When was the last time someone wearing a monacle asked you to dance? These are great old time tunes from the days of princes and princesses dancing the night away in glorious gowns and powdered wigs. There are some real toe tappers here if you are going to go dancing in a large ballroom. I only gave this one 3 stars because the recording is not quite stellar. Even though this wonderful music was recorded in DDD, there is room for improvement. Overall, a nice set of waltzes and polkas."
5,Adventure in Tunisia,"Written in 1946 and chosen for young people by a committee of the Junior Literary Guild, including Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt, as an outstanding publication for older readers. This is a wonderful look into Arab village life in the city of Kariwan, Tunisia, as its inhabitants prepare for a visit by His Higness, the Mushir Mohammed es Sadoc Pasha Bey. Two young cousins, Alee and Breeka, find their talents and revel in the joy of discovery. A beautifully illustrated and detailed look inside Muslim culture."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"This is one of the best personal defense knifes I have ever owned. You can puncture the heart or aortic valve easier than any other edged weapon I have ever used. If you need to make an edged kill trust me this is the blade for you.Thanks to Cold Steel for their product, it truly is a professionals choice.Casey"
5,Great Knife,I have been using Cold Steel products since the mid nineties and have never been disappointed. I have one of these knives that I use almost daily and bought this one to give as a gift. They are easy to sharpen and hold an edge very well.
5,Nice knife!!,"Got this for hubby a rainy day gift! He loves it!!! Ordered him the bigger size last year, he really likes that one too, but was kinda heavy to have in shorts pocket......I think he found his favorites!!!"
5,Great Blade.,This blade is very nice. Made well and solid as a rock. The whole knife is well made and solid. It looks awesome too.
5,Sweet,"I bought this knife for myself, but my boyfriend loves it so much I am giving it to him. I want something a little bit easier to open, since you have to hold down the button to release the blade. He like the feel of it and it looks pretty bad ass."
5,My third one!!! Love this knife.,"This is my third one, because I love this knife. I bought one a while ago when Chesapeak knives and tools used to be around, they were $90 then. Once I found that amazon were selling them for about half the price I also bought one for my bro. I love how the knife is slim, fast opening(catches your inside pocket and blade flips out) and locks tight. Great knife, Cold Steel got this one right. Will be ordering the 6in for the house real soon."
4,Great knife but has 1 problem,"I bought this knife because i carry around some expensive electronics for school and work. In California these can be an issue with the police so i went with the completely legal Ti-Lite. i coudnt afford the titanium at the time and didnt see much of a point in spending over $100 anyway. This knife though is beautiful, it cuts through meat and almost anything i need to as long as its nothing like thick wire or anything and the hinge opens easily...usually. one big problem is its kind of annoying to take apart and clean because of the oiled plastic inside. it would have been better if they used metal studs or zytel molded into the handle. This makes cleaning abit of a chore compared to most other Folders iv used. Other than that its a truly amazing knife for the price and i would recommend it. i hear the titanium one is nicer though"
2,Not for me!,"This knife looks cool and gets such outstanding reviews, so I took a chance and ordered one. I was excited to receive it, but that faded quickly as I checked it out. It doesn't really open all that easily as advertised. The tang that is supposed to catch on the corner your pocket for quick opening is so sharp and edgy that it will rip the corner of your pockets apart in no time. Even using the tang with your finger or thumb is edgy to the touch. One thing I will say though is that it arrived very sharp and the blade appears to be of high quality...although with a significant amount of wiggle. There is no way this knife is worth the $70 retail price. With the $40-ish cost from Amazon...you decide. I decided to return it."
4,Well built,"I have this knife and it's bigger brother...both are well built, and stay sharp..I love the pocket-opener. Cold Steel makes good stuff"
3,better through modification,"Overall this is a pretty good knife. The knife is very easy to open without the thumb bolt, so I removed it. I also took the pocket clip off and cut off 2/3 - now it's easier to get in and out of a pocket and the clip still holds it up. After removing the thumb bolt I then expanded the indent from the tiny opening to one that is almost thumb size. Now the knife is much easier to unlock and I would consider it pretty decent.Great value for money."
3,"Cool knife, limited practicality","This is a cool knife. I bought the Zytel-handled version, sight unseen. Normally, I insist on handling a knife before buying it. I made an exception in this case because I just liked the look of the it, was somewhat swayed by the enthusiastic reviews, and the price was reasonable enough.The good:* very sharp* very cool-looking* strong liner lock* opens as advertised--fast using a pocketThe bad:* totally impractical for everyday carry (EDC)* sharp edges poke you when worn in a pocket* can't move the pocket clip (lefties are out of luck on this one)* if you are even slightly klutzy, you have to practice opening it or you can seriously hurt yourself while deploying itWell, I was warned about all of the above before I bought it and I still had to have it. I am happy with my knife. It's not an EDC, but it's a nice addition to my collection."
4,Would buy again.,"Bought this knife because wanted a cheap everyday carry knife. All and all works ok at opening packaging and such, but were you using it to open would like to have it be a bit wider. Had about 1 week before I tried to take it out of my pocket while sitting in the car. Little nub sticking out just before the blade is designed to catch the edge of your pocket while pulling it out. It achieved its objective and accidently stabbed a hole in seat with the fairly sharp point of the knife. Knife is a wonderful blade for the price. Would not recommend taking it out while sitting though."
3,Coolness over practicality,"This is a tactical stiletto style knife, plain and simple.PROS: Looks cool. Locks up like a tank. Reasonable weight. Well-built. Razor sharp out of the box.CONS: The finger guards (double as flipper/wave openers) are uncomfortable for gripping and will chew your pants up. Wave feature sometimes opens the blade when you want to just draw it closed (DANGEROUS). Blade is straight and not practical for everyday tasks. Not reversible tip up/right hand only clip. Thumbstud on one side only.Debatable: Blade material. Handle size/geometry. Somewhat recessed thumb stud. Made in Taiwan. Intimidating appearance.Overall, it's a nice piece to add to your collection and show your friends, but not practical for every day carry."
3,Great if you can get it under $40,"Very good blade for AUS 8A with a strong point and razor sharp edge.The knife is a bit difficult to open with the flippers...the are very sharp and uncomfortable to use. I read another review where someone sanded the flippers down to be more comfortable. That is probably a good idea if you have the tools.The handle is a good size but the grip is given by holes that are a bit strange. I would rather a solid Zytel handle with some texture. G10 is far superior to Zytel in my oppinion.Knife locks up solid, though, and once open would make a great self defense knife.Needs some more work but a cool knife.I wish I had gotten the Aluminum handle version rather than the Zytel."
3,Predictable and disappointing,"KST is good as is everyone in this miniseries so it isn't the acting that galls me, it's the story itself. A nun who questions her vocation? Ok, it's been done already but ok. It's her rapid decline into the modern world, going from doubting to debauchery in a heartbeat. And once again, the music overshadows the story. She walks across the room, music. She gets on an elevator, music. Enough w/the music drowning out the dialogue already. Sometimes silence is better. Oh, and some character background would be ever so helpful, such as why she entered the convent in the first place. Apparently, her sister-in-law has resented her for 16 years feeling abandoned and betrayed yet we're not privvy to the reason. This story needs more ""soul""."
3,Welsh/English History?,"I love BBC productions about as much as I love history, literature, writing, dancing, and acting! The main thing I do have to say is that, there weren't any convents left in Wales/England during this time period, hence no Nuns. I can sight you dates, etc. but the fact still remains."
1,VERY POOR VIDEO AND SOUND,"BAD REPRODUCTION, SOUND QUALITY POOR AND COULD NOT UNDERSTAND A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF DIALOG. REALLY NEEDED SUBTITLES FOR THIS VIDEO."
2,SO SLOW,THIS WAS REALLY VERY SLOW AND SOMETIMES QUITE BORING. I WATCHED MOST OF IT THINKING IT WOULD GET BETTER. NEVER DID.VERY PREDICTABLE.I JUST FAST FORWARDED IT TO THE END.
1,DVD,I didn't care for this movie at all. I was very disappointed in it and would not recommend it myself. It had no rating so I was surprised at some scenes that were unexpected. I am glad I wasn't watching it with anyone else so I could fast forward through certain parts.
1,Not What I Saw on Masterpiece Theater!,"There are scenes in this video that must have been edited when it was shown on PBS's Masterpiece Theater. The cover states it is the same version, but these scenes would certainly raise the ire of the FCC."
1,Thoroughly revolting...,"While it is true many women have left the convent and religious life, very few I am sure begin their ""new"" lives seeking utter debauchery like this. Kristin Scott Thomas offers another pallid portrayal which adds little to this sappy melodrama, guising itself as a ""woman's story"". Save your money and order ""Come To The Stable"" or ""The Song of Bernadette""."
1,Worthless for regrowing lost hair,"My husband has thinning hair in the front and so we decided to try Folicure's formula to regrow some of that lost hair. He followed the directions on the bottles and used it daily for 2 months. Well, after close examination, we determined that this product has had no discernible effect on his hair and scalp. No thicker look and no new hair growth.Perhaps this isn't designed for regrowing lost hair, though that was what we were lead to believe. Perhaps we needed to use other Folicure products to have the full effect? Either way, we've given up on this stuff now.Just FYI: My husband's hair is light colored, generally thick (except in front), and soft in texture."
3,It helps but no miracles!,I have been using this product for over one year. I don't think it works miracles but there has been improvement in the amount of lost hair. I use it after shampooing and notice new growth consistently. I'm not sure it's worth the expense but even a little bit of help in keeping my thinning hair is an improvement. Yes. I would recommend it until I find something that works better. I've tried Ovation and I do think this is better and more economical!
5,Excellent product,This is an excellent product. I started to use this product a few months ago and I have to say now my hair is safe! Folicure makes your hair stronger and thicker. This product is WONDERFUL!
5,Great knife,"This is a fantastic knife, as are most of cold steels knifes, great gift.this is my second bird & trout knife, the other is the carbon 5 which they unfortunately no longer make. you won't be unhappy. great design."
2,does not hold a edge,second cold steel knife and both do not hold a edge. if you want a good knife buy a kershaw.
5,Great paring knife for your chow-box (camping),"There are lots of reviews for this product. One thing missing is that the scabbard is mountable. We use a plywood chow box for camping, and mounted the scabbard for this to the bottom of one of the inside shelves. It pulls out easily, and is always right where we left it because there isn't nay other place to put it down. I stuck another one to the bottom of the kitchen cabinet and it is probably the most-used knife in the kitchen."
4,Handy little Knife,I take it on every woods outing and it holds an edge well. I haven't had any corrosion or bending. I mainly us it for small skinning tasks or as a steak knife during a campfire meal.
4,neat,"the sheath works better than i assumed it would, it clicks into place pretty well. i wouldn't wear it as a necklace, it will come out if tugged on a little. and it does get a little rusty, but i won't hold that against them because i abuse it and i assume that if they used a more corrosion resistant stainless steel blend then it would be too soft. also makes a cool steak knife!"
5,Very Sweet,This Knife came razor sharp with a needle like tip. The knife fits in my hand pretty good and the end ring is roomy enough to use with gloves.
1,wrong cd in box!!!,"I ordered ""Ricky Skaggs - Highway 40 Blues"" and got ""Ricky Skaggs - Favorite Country Songs"". The case had the correct title and song listing but the inside cd wasn't the right one. How can I get the correct one and return this one? Rie418"
5,Chock-a-block!,"This has loads of tips and tricks for both sewing machine and serger that would be very helpful to anyone with either/both, and is good on its own for serger information (compared to serger books which often include too much information on the ""high-end"" coverlock sergers few of us own). The techniques are well illustrated and the stitches themselves, rather than garments, photographed. This is a good one-stop-shopping manual for anyone returning to sewing after a many-year hiatus, with the machines so high-tech now it's like starting from scratch. Full of great, useful ideas. You didn't know your little machine could do so much!"
5,Excellent book for all sewers!,This book is an easy read with excellent tips for new techniques. It is organized by topic making it a time efficient resource guide. I use it constantly in my sewing room.
3,Not as much as I'd hoped for,"It's a good book with lots of reference, but it's primarily decorative stuff, like fancy buttonholes, etc. I don't own a serger, don't care if I ever do, but I was impressed with doing embroidery with the machine I do have. I don't use it as much as I thought I would, but perhaps I'll take another look at it and see how I can utilize some of them, like the eyelets."
5,Sony = LiteOn,"To Kyle Parkin ""Shadow"", you said you don't recommend buying LiteOn. I have two Sony DVD burners (DW-D18a) and BOTH are actually re-badged LiteOns (as are most Sony drives). Just an FYI. My Sony DVD burners treated me quite well and I imagine this one will do the same."
5,Sony does it again!,"I won't get technical with this review by listing a bunch of techno-mumbo jumbo. All I will say is that after installing the drive in my computer and installing the drivers, this baby ran immediately and to date has not given me any problems. I found the removable face plate (one installed and the other is black) of the drive a bit tedious to do so I gave it up and settled with the white. Doesn't match my Dell but who cares. I bought the drive for its performance, not its looks. I burn DVDs in 15 minutes. Reading DVDs and CDs on this drive is normal as expected. The only gripe I have doesn't deal with hardware at all but with the dual/double-layer medium: they are over expensive! I've searched the web for DL DVDs and for a 3-pack the price is about $25. I truly hope the price drops dramatically in the near future. For now, I am using DVD-R to back up my movies with no problems. Sony did a great job with this internal drive."
5,Add on to B. T. Denyer's Review,"I have to say that B. T. Denyer's review pretty much covers it all (choose ""See all X customer reviews..."" if it's not showing). The reason I'm posting this add-on is because, is BT's review, he/she said that the OEM version of Nero that comes with the DRU-810A can't be updated via the Nero website. While the Nero website does hide the updates (they want you to ""purchase"" the newest version), they are still available for free through Nero's ftp server located here: ftp://ftp4.usw.nero.com/oem/Sony/. In fact, this is the location that this OEM version of Nero checks when you use the ""Check for Updates"" feature so I imagine this is the permanent location for the OEM updates. If you want my opinion on the product, check out B.T. Denyer's review."
2,One of the worst I've owned,"I've only owned it for a few months, and it started throwing mostly coasters within a few weeks: both DVD and DVD-DL (surprising for a Sony), even on slower speeds. Burn would complete, but verification always showed multiple errors. CDs were fine. I'd purchased a Sony NEC Optiarc for my backup PC, and ended up switching them because the less-expensive Optiarc was far more consistent & reliable.Perhaps I just got a bad one, or perhaps those who are pleased with it aren't doing verification scans after a burn."
2,"Not bad, but expected more.","I am running Windows 2000, and thought this would be an excellent addition. My old CD Burner was too slow - but it worked well. I have had continous problems with CDs that I have burned. The first few songs play and then around the 8th to 10th song it stops working. Also could not always play DVDs. Granted I have a P3 1 GHz processor, which is slow but it is listed as being compatible. In hind sight I wish I bought a different model."
1,Not Happy,"I ordered this from Tiger Direct. No where in the ads that I read on their site at the time told what system this could be used in therefore I ordered it only to find out my system wouldn't handle it and parts were missing from it and the box had been opened and the bar code cut out and taped back on. I wrote and asked could they just send the missing parts and I would give the unit away, they told me to return it. You have to pay return shipping when it is their error and they also charged a re-stocking fee so this product that I couldn't use cost an additional $18. If you want to try it, don't order it from TD and be sure to check the system requirements as it takes a powerful machine to use it."
3,Very Good Service,The product arrived fast but I ordered the wrong kind of burner. But besides that it was very good service.
2,"Worked OK for about 230 days, then stopped.","The drive arrived at the end of December, was quick to get up and running, and worked fine until yesterday. Then it got the machine equivalent of ""lockjaw"" and I've been unable to get the tray to release.So, it's a good drive while it operates, but I'll probably make sure I pay for at least a 1-year warranty on my next purchase.As far as my recommendation goes, it depends very much on how inconvenient it is when one's drive fails. Yesterday, I just went to a backup burner and kept working; if I had NEEDED to get the job done, and I had not previously developed a strategy of always keeping a backup device handy, I'd have been in a seething, hair-pulling rage. Computer hardware is never 100% reliable, but is it worth the risk to purchase a device that is known to fail in less than a year?"
5,Great Product,Arrived as expected in good condition. I used Memorex 16x dvds and not a single one fried up. It burns a single dvd in less than 9 mins. I highly recommend it to everyone. It works great.
1,Horrible piece of crap!!,I have had this for a little over a year and it has never worked right and getting any kind of suppport has been futile!! It will not read cd or dvd's. Upgraded the firmware and that did no good.
2,Unresolved problem,"I am still awaiting resolution of a problem I have with these drives. In writing DVDs I get verification errors. This proboem arises if the drives are used in an external firewire enclosure. The drive works fine if internal in your computer attached to the IDE bus, but there is an issue if attached to your computer by firewire."
3,Just okay,"I enjoyed this game, but it did have a few flaws that were annoying. For instance, some of the characters you had to interact with were hard to understand and you couldn't always get them to repeat themselves. I missed out on some hints that way, and had to go online to find out what I missed. It wasn't my speakers, as I've never had this problem before. Also didn't like that you were more or less forced to do things in a certain order rather than exploring and solving puzzles on your own. Not a bad game overall, but I've played better."
2,"Good Idea, but lacking alot","In general the gameplay was fun, but it had many flaws.One issue being the fact that even though you back in time your ALWAYS in the same area, the architecture is differnt in each era but it still lacks alot. One other big dissapointment in the game is how incredibly short it was. Personally i think it was a waste of 10 dollars. this game had obvious potential but, its lack of gameplay and Creativity on some aspects really brought it down."
5,A Surprise and Delight-- A stunning book,"This book deserves a whole universe of stars, not just 5 Stars. Most experts get ""tired and repetitive"" when they hit their 3rd or 4th books. But Leatrice's new book,the Color Answer Book, breaks new ground for her, yet she never diminishes her message. She informs and teaches with delightful wit and an elegant style. Most importantly, she asks the questions we ought to ask ourselves about color, but are too uninformed to know how to, even better; she gives us smart, intelligent, useful answers. What a package! Where else do you get the Questions and the Answers in Life, or in this case, in color?Brava, Leatrice. Thank you again for giving us all a wonderful tool. This ought to be gift wrapped and packaged with ""Communicating with Color"" and given to anyone who has color in their life or their business.This is going to be another book I advise my clients to run out and buy. .........."
5,martial arts reader,"I have read a multitude of books on peak performance training. Many over the last few years have sections that copy from this book word for word. It is good to finally find the original.Highly recommended not only for the martial artist, but for anyone interested in peak performance athletic training."
3,Very Informative!,"I bought this book because I wanted some techniques to help with physical training. I thought that it would provide some short stories to compliment the information but it kinda reads like a text book, which isn't all that bad. For the price and the wealth of information that is contains it is a good buy. Also it is written by a Doctor so, you know that it has to have some basis in truth. I would reccommend it to anyone who wants to know how to enhance their Total Mind Body Training..."
3,Delightful!,"I hadn't heard of Beriot before, but after hearing the Concerto No. 8, I bought this CD. To be honest, the ""Military"" Concerto No. 1 doesn't trip my trigger, but the other two are well worth the admission price!"
4,Good quality minature,"Okay, it's a Elvis minature... you either want one or you don't. So, having said that - I'll say this. It is made very well, with the exception that some of the snap-in parts could fit just a bit better. If you are careful when assembling it, it will be fine - just be careful or you could break some small delicate parts.The bottom of mine is not perfectly flat, and has some wobble to it - not much, just a bit. Something to consider if that would bug you. You could add some felt to the bottom to soften it out I s'pose."
3,Elvis deserved to have his toys made of BETTER quality....,"I'll give this toy kudos for originality but the quality of the toy was terrible! I swear it takes a person with a PhD in Engineering to figure out how to put the toy together. Elvis' chair broke apart while I was trying to assemble it. My suggestion is that if you're going to buy this toy, keep it in its box and display the box (plus it might be an investment in the long run). If you want to remove the toy from the box, have some super glue handy because you will need it. In theory the idea of the Elvis Comeback '68 toy was genius, but in reality the quality of the toy was bad. The only durable part of the toy was the Elvis doll himself. This is sad, a toy that's supposed to be a tribute to Elvis turned out to be of poor quality. Elvis would have been disappointed...."
5,Best textbook I've ever read...,"Great book! It's a required textbook for one of my classes, but I really enjoy reading it! It's informative, interesting, and well written. Not a book I plan to sell back."
5,Best book I read in a long time,"I just finish reading this book last night, it is one of tHe best books I have read so far. What an amzing story by Javire Moro and it is beatifully told. I love how he also mixed in there the history of india."
3,,"This sounds more Metalcore than thrash, even though Carnal Forge's roots originate from thrash. Picture Lamb of God exchanging sounds with At The Gates minus the technicality and you get an idea of what this band is about these days. Short and to-the-point it's all over in 35 minutes. Much of the riffing tends to sound tedious at times and after a while it all sounds interchangeable, but thanks to the fury and anger within the tracks they never lose their intensity. The album is mostly fast-driven for almost its entirety, but amidst the chaos you will hear some notable melodic parts which do blend well with the music. Full with energy and extreme adrenaline this record is a decent, passable listen but doesn't quite manage to remain memorable."
4,Initial Comments,"Excellent value for money,hard cover,gloss paper,good graphics and photos.Text covers Caig Ellwoods full career and life."
3,Improving vocabulary skills,This was purchased for my grand daughter. She needed it for school and is now using it for her college course.
4,"Nice, but not Joe's best","Nice Joe Arroyo album. He maintains his joeson mixture, which is enough to get anyone up and dancing. Still, this is not his best work, in my opinion, and I'd recommend contemporary Deja que te Cante or 32 Grandes Exitos instead.Great song on this one: Mama."
2,NHL 08,NHL 08 is a game that could have been great but is marred by the complex controls. To control the players they asume that you have an advanced controller which I do not. The music is nice but the commentators annoying so I switched the language to russian which makes it more tollerable since I do not understand russian. The graphics are ok but feel recycled from earlier versions of the NHL series. I felt a bit disappointed by this and will see if NHL 09 does it any better. Not recommended. 2/5.
3,nhl 08 welcomes the ahl,it does not look that much different then 07. i think the best new thing is that you can be ahl teams. i think next year they should put ohl team on there. i give it an 7 out of 10
5,Only Popular History of Any State's Counties?,"WVU Press has re-issued this book in 1998, an expanded history with latest information on every county's vital stats -- pct minorities, ages, income, et al. Very complete, even listing several ""notable persons"" for each county. Complete with maps and photos.There's plenty about Putnam County, including the map showing Hurricane and the home area of Jack Whitaker, who won the biggest one-winner Powerball prize on Christmas Day 2002 ($314.9 million)... just the tax on Whitaker's winnings paid off one-third of the Mountain State debt for that year.""The Fifty-Five""is the bible for West Virginia's counties."
3,Michael was sexy in this one....,I saw this darned movie waaaaayyyy back in the early 80's. Michael's character was married and he lost his hand because his wife did not know how to drive and sideswiped a truck. Then hand took on a life of it's own and began haunting Michael's life. My favorite scene was the sex scene Michael did with the student. Pretty good thriller. They don't make em like this anymore.
4,Good movie,Classic early thriller by Oliver Stone. This is a really good movie that probably some people may not know about.
3,"Okay, but not great.","I watched ""The Hand"" for the first time on DVD. The film was okay, but not great. It wasn't actually 'bad', just not at the level of really good horror films, in my opinion."
3,"A FRIGHT DELIGHT FOR THE ""HORROR"" GENRE",After losing his hand in a freak car accident Michael Caine's life goes insane when his missing hand goes on a kill crazy ramapge reacting to the mind thought's. Interesting concept an Outlandish Caine performance! Especally the ending when Caine is strapped down into a chair and with his thoughts kills his doctor by chocking her to death. Pure silliness but wacthable.
1,oliver stone and michael caine don't make a great horror team,this is so bad that it almost gets funny at the end but this tale of caine loseing his hand and then it killing anyone who makes him mad is just silly and the f/x 's are down right no good . no hand for this low rent horror movie. just a mess
5,An Absolutely GREAT book! Of course.,"This book was a great pleasure to read. Right now it's my favorite Star Wars book and my favorite Jedi Apprentice book. For anyone who hasn't read this book, you should read it. And the rest of the series. I was happy to read about Guerra and hear a little about Owen, Obi-Wan's brother. The only problem about the Jedi Apprentice books is since I live in Austalia I have to wait longer for the books to come out."
4,Arkansas Fisherman Loves It...,I'm in California and my son lives in Arkansa. I bought it for him as a birthday present and had it shipped to him. He loves it. Nuff said...
5,In LOVE with this text,"As an instructor, I am in LOVE with this text. I teach an argument-based research composition course and this text has improved the effectiveness of my teaching methods while at the same time making learning enjoyable for my students. The text is easy to read and uses language familiar with students of all ages (I teach at a community college and as a result the age range is tremendous). In addition, the book includes relevant examples that students can further relate to. I have taught this course previously using another textbook for three semesters and I dreaded the use of the previous textbook. Now, teaching this course, while using this text for the first time, I get excited creating my class agenda. The activities included in the text allows for the students to foster dynamic discussion. I have never before LOVED textbook this much. I look forward to continuing using this text."
5,Perfect!,The book was in perfect condition and I got it in the mail right away! I will definitely be buying more books from this seller!
5,Great Customer Service,"I received my purchase just as the seller described. It was in better condition than I expected and over all I saved 40 dollars by buying through Amazon rather than going through the local book store. Also the seller was a pleasure to work with, they worked with me to make sure the book was sent to the right address since I had given the wrong address to begin with and my purchase was received in plenty of time for me to be ready for school. Thank you Amazon and thank you seller!"
4,Delivered Quickly,"Delivered on time and the condition it was in, while a tad weathered, was overall satisfactory and as described."
3,Svankmajer == great. DVD prodution quality == horrible,"The content here is great. Jan Svankmajer is a brilliant filmmaker, and this collection shows some of the wonderful imagery he puts together. If you know any of his work, this won't be a surprise to you. If you don't, it's time to look at this collection.The bad? The production quality here is horrible. I don't have a single DVD drive/player that can read both disks. Some play the first one, others play the second. The menus are of a lower quality than I've made on DVDs I've mastered myself, using basic DVD authoring software. The paper sleeve mis-matches the titles of the shorts with the specific shorts on the disk."
4,Good selection of shorts,"but definitely not comprehensive. I wish Kino would have taken the initiative to make a complete collection of his shorts. As it is, it's the only game in town right now if you want to watch any of Svankmajer's short films. Personally, I prefer his later work and find most of his earlier films on disk one boring."
4,Is there a booklet that comes with this?,"I would've liked to read more about the artist.... if there isn't a booklet, then I will nod to the reviews about poor production value and mismatched tracklistings."
3,Not what I expected...,"Jan Svankmajer is certainly an attractive man... not that I roll that way mind you... I'm just sayin.I purchased ""The Collected Shorts of Jan Svankmajer"" thinking that I would be receiving a few pairs of his worn underpants... perhaps a sampler of boxers, briefs and maybe even a mesh banana hammock or two. Not that I planned on sniffing them mind you.As it turns out, this isn't a collection of undergarments at all. It is a DVD with some brief movies on it. My complaint is simply perhaps the product could have been more clearly titled: The Collected Short MOVIES of Jan Svankmajer."
1,Shame on Albert for Endorsing a Bad Product,"I've played Backyard Baseball 2005 and it brought me hours of enjoyment. I played about 1 half a game in Backyard Baseball 2007 and it brought me instant pain. The controls are clumsy, the camera settings for the graphics are bad. It's just not very playable or very much fun. Go back to Backyard Baseball 2005 and start over from there. I was extremely disapointed in Backyard Baseball 2007.Albert you should know something about a product before putting your name on it. Play Backyard Baseball 2005."
4,It's a hit!!,I bought this for my 6 yr old son and he loves it. I was worried about the reviews I read before purchasing but I had no problems with the product and it has been lots of fun. He plays it everyday...He found it hard the first few times but he has already won the World Series in easy mode after a month. We also have Backyard Hockey 2005 and we love both of them.
3,"razor-sharp precision but a girlish, flute-like voice lacking a sense of flesh and blood","Razor-sharp precision (more in the second Queen of the Night aria than in the first, though), suitably fiery characterization (a welcome change from the placid and plangent Queen of the Nights in those days), but a girlish, flute-like timbre, very pure and angelic in pieces like Flotow's ""Letzte Rose"" from his opera ""Martha"", acceptable in Bohème (a Mimi sounding 15 year-old, why not?) but lacking ""beef"" and unable to fully convey the range of emotions of the more dramatic characters (Konstanze, Queen of the Night, Violetta), giving it all a somewhat superficial air of German operetta (and everything IS sung in German, by the way, except the aria from Weber's rare Ines de Castro) rather than flesh and blood. Meet Erna Berger, soprano coloratura of a bygone era. Good transfers."
1,Eureka Boss upright vacuum,"Rated a one (1) simply because it was not assembled and I have no idea how it would work.That was unfortunate, because, I have an older model of this Vac and It was great. I would had to have taken this item to a Vac. repair to have it assembled. This infor should have been on the web site."
5,removable canister vacs don't suck...they don't work at all,"Finally got the removable canister thing out of my system and returned to good old disposable bag vac from Hoover. It seemed that that the only disposable thing were those pesky vacuums I kept buying. I admit, our cleaning lady is very abusive to our cleaning equipment, but it was ridiculous that we had to buy vacuums twice or more a year. It seemed like the more gadgets and contraptions the vacuums had, the faster she eliminated them. This Hoover is bare bones, no bells and whistles, just designed to do one thing, CLEAN. I'm going to order a back up vac to keep upstairs pretty soon."
4,Eureka Vacuum Cleaner Review,"I bought this vacuum because I had bought a similar Montgomery Wards vacuum cleaner (made by Eureka) over 40 years ago which just gave out.I like the new vacuum because it is lighter than the old one. It seems to do a fine job on carpet.I'm not so fond of some features: it only has one speed instead of two, which means that it is too powerful for throw rugs. Changing the height didn't seem to help. That may become less of a problem as the bag gets full.Also, the cord now comes off the bottom of the vaccum, while it used to come off the top. It is in the way more with the new configuration.My old attachments don't work either because the method of attaching them has changed.But for the price I think it is a good deal."
2,Basic at Best,"I bought this vacuum thinking it was a true Electrolux, but got Eureka instead (should have looked at the stock photo a little closer). In a nutshell: poor handling, hard to move around on higher pile carpeting, feels as though the cheaply made plastic handle will break off while operating and the cord is painfully short. The pro? Good suction."
3,Basic vacuum,Seems to work just fine. I hope the simplicity results in longevity. The handle feels a little wobbly--I wish it were more metal and less plastic.
1,Pay no attention to the picture,"As has already been stated, the photograph for this item is incorrect. This is actually the full-disc label. So it gets one star for being misleading. Again, if you think you're getting the Digital Vinyl CD-R labels, you're not."
2,Not Satisfied,"Buy these labels ONLY if you have the aforementioned Label Kit. This is ONLY a refill kit, and will not work standalone! Not only is there no software/templates ANYWHERE, but the hole in the center of the label is larger than the CD hole, meaning there is no easy way to apply these labels (unless you have the full kit, of course).Matthew"

3,Historical Reference - Not a Performance CD/DVD,"Mistakenly ordered this, thinking it was an actual performance CD.Instead it's an AUDIO AUTOBIOGRAPHY.Despite my disappointment, I listened to it all. Its wonderfully upbeat.NOTES: Parts of this CD were heard on National Public Radio.The voice interview of John Cleese is of terrible audio quality.CONCLUSION: The Python Ethic of Work (PEW) really, really shines through and I'm gratified to see them give high billing to Plain Old Work (POW). Enthusiastic admirers will be pleased with the background info."
4,The Pythons,"After purchasing the complete set of DVD's and laughing so hard I was sick, I just had to find out out they did it. This book answered my question. I enjoyed it, but it was a bit long and somewhat redundant."
4,380 pages ... but still not enough!,"A great read and remarkable to see how honest the Pythons are (especially when criticising each other). Sadly, it doesn't present much hope for further movie or stage productions, given the way they slam each other so openly!The book loses one star for not having detailed analysis/memories of specific sketches. I would have enjoyed sketch by sketch notes by the relevant writers. The superior versions of the Python movie DVDs provide this through commentary tracks, but not so the ""Flying Circus"" DVDs. Volume two (and a further 380 pages) please!!"
4,Lectura para señores poderosos,"este libro es de muy facil lectura, ideal para aquellos que estan siempre corriendo, buscando nuevos desafios, nuevos exitos, nuevas metas. Si eres una de esas personas que esta acostumbradas al exito, siempre quieres mas, preguntate porque no has tenido tiempo para leer un buen libro como este.....tal vez, la respuesta la encuentres en este libro.El autor narra una historia de un caballero preso en su propia armadura, una metafora que a veces resulta un tanto infantil y obvia para referirse a un ser ""poderoso"" de los tiempos actuales (algo asi como un ejecutivo exitoso). Muestra como en el mundo de hoy, ""la carrera por el exito"" nos puede llevar a una derrota aplastante ...a perder lo mas querido y fundamental... si ha pasado mas de un mes desde que besaste con AMOR a tu mujer, despeinaste a tu hijo o jugaste con tu perro....(te acuerdas como se llama tu perro? )....lee este libro YA!....aun es tiempo"
4,Bueno,"En realidad fue un regalo para mi señora, que quería este libro desde hace un tiempo atrás, me comentó que era entretenido, pero un poco corto.Demoró el envió, pero finalmente apareció. Gracias."
2,Tedious,"Having just read Bonfire of the Vanities which I enjoyed, I looked forward to another of Tom Wolfe's novels and was disappointed in this one. I found none of the characters to be admirable nor all that interesting. In fact the story became tedious with the drawn out angst of not only Charlotte but just darn near every character in the book. Always making a gallant effort to complete any book I'm reading, I was relieved to finally reach the end of the book and say goodbye to the superficial characters contained within."
1,high hopes for an insipid book,"When you finish a book hating every single character, you know you wasted precious time. This book came highly recommended by a friend who usually steers me in the right direction with book choices, so I came in expecting something well worth reading. This book is not worth the time or money. It is so off the mark in every conceivable respect. I can't think of one redeemable characteristic, it is that bad. Actually, I only kept reading because I expected there must be something that makes it worthwhile at the end. Far from it. The end was the biggest let down of all, and that's saying a lot considering how poorly done the rest is. This should have been a good book, even a great book. I don't understand how an editor would let this book go to publication without more revision. Tom Wolfe, you need a better editor, one who can help you build on a premise and flush out full-bodied characters."
4,Mildly Disappointed,"I have always loved reading anything by Tom Wolfe and found his prose as wonderful as always, but wished he would have picked another subject."
4,Laughed out loud,"I laughed out loud more than once. I never do that. Mr. Wolf really has a way with words. I've read that I Am Charlotte Simmons is predictable and to a degree it is. The author basically tells you what will happen in the prologue (the monkees in the lab). It's how he gets there and to what degree. I've also read that he wraps it up too quickly at the end. Well, he does that in all of his novels. That's what is so interesting about getting to the end. In between the prologue and final chapter there is much to be enjoyed. I was never bored and looked forward to every chapter. ""Jojo loathed himself"". Soo been there."
1,Who cares?,"Although there are bits in this novel that are very funny, it is a chore to read. The satire is so overblown that it gets ludicrous and tiresome, and the characters, who never become anything more than plot devices, are so shallow that it's impossible to care what happens to any of them. Tom Wolfe has written some great novels, but this isn't one of them."
2,Don't waste your valuable time,"A friend lent me this book and I decided to read the online reviews before devoting myself to the almost 700 pages. Since the reviews were quite mixed, I wanted to see for myself. It started off with well and the characters of Charlotte, Adam, JoJo and Hoyt were well developed. I enjoyed the first 1/3 of the book. but by the end, I could barely stand to read another word. This book could certainly be cut in half and it wouldn't lose a thing. The biggest disappointment was that after all Charlotte went through to belong to the ""popular"" crowd, she didn't learn one darn thing. At the end, she sat at the table with JoJo hoping to be noticed by the popular girls. She sat at the basketball stadium looking around to see if people noticed that she was JoJo's girlfriend. What a sad, sad way to portray an intelligent young woman."
2,A Tedious Cliche,"I guess this is meant to be a portrait of current campus life but I found it to be a thin cliche of situations and personalities one might find on the quad. Charlotte the overachiever country girl set adrift on an adventure she is ill prepared to take. Beverly, her all too sophisticated roommate who only gives Charlotte more grief than she can bare. Jojo, the athlete stereotype that gets turned around to greater things. Hoyte Thorp, a legendary BMOC and the easily predictable relationship with Charotte. Adam, the archtype nerd also figures in this going nowhere story of campus life. As if the story needed to be worse it is over full of the campus patois which is most distracting."
1,"Save a tree, don't buy this book.",Tom Wolfe is a talented writer. But why he has to subject us to 650 pages of profanity is beyond me. He must have used the F-word at least 3-5 times per page. Save a tree and your money. Do not buy this book.
2,75 year old man attempt about a college his daughter went to,Crisp writing is the only positive remark I can make about this book. 75 year old men should lay off trying to write books that are blatantly insulting against a particular school that they have never attended and honestly know nothing about. I'm a student at the school and this book is a horrible and wrong representation of our university. Write about something you can actually relate to at some level.
1,The wrong stuff,"Someone needs to tell Tom Wolfe that it's not 1963 anymore or even 1978 and that the antics of frat boys at Faber College aren't news. This book is awash in sexual escapades, and Wolfe sounds like a drooling perv as he attempts to describe said antics...it's really terribly pitiful and even creepy. This book is so incredibly pretentious, like much of Wolfe's work, that the reader may be tempted to gnaw off their own hands in order to escape from it. Aside from being a terrific sleep aid, or a nice door stop, I cannot think of a good use for this book. I suppose you could keep it handy and throw it up on the shelf for whenever you wanted to impress visiting liberal New York elitists. Wolfe's arrogance as a writer indicate that he has spent a little too much time reading his own press clippings.[...]"
2,"No, He's Not","Very disappointing writing from an author whose previous work I enjoyed and admired. My overall impression is that no one actually edited this book: most of the scenes and descriptions go on and on and on, sometimes repeating phrases verbatim (""traps, delts, pecs, lats...""); there are also several places where abrupt changes in subject in the same paragraph simply don't track. [Maybe Wolfe is of such a stature that he doesn't need an editor, the same way that the title of his book doesn't need to appear on the cover.] Wolfe also seems not to get quite right the mindsets and motivations of many of his characters, many of whom are 1-dimensional parodies of their prototypes, seeming, mostly, just overwraught. To me, this book feels as if it were an experiement in ""can I write about people from social milleaus I don't know and situations I haven't personally experienced?"" I'd say, not convincingly. The book feels long, long-winded, unconvincing, and only intermittently pleasurable."
1,Sad old Tom Wolfe,"This book was such a pathetic attempt to be hip, to write about life on the campus today. All of Wolfe's characters are shallow stereotypes. And does he think we need to have the many ways the f word is used explained to us? Where has he been? Does he think we live in a vacuum? His self-satisfaction at describing it as f-patois is only made worse when he uses the word ""schadenfreude"" over and over again. And again. And naming all the muscles the athletes work at developing, ad naseum.... The book is like a cartoon that has been written down, tediously.If it hadn't been my book club's pick, I never would have finished it.reader in Sewickley PA"
1,BOOORRRING,"WAY TOO BORING; WAY TOO LONG; DID I MENTION BORING? WOULDN'T HAVE FINISHED IT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE BOOK CLUB AND YOU CAN'T TALK IF YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED THE BOOK!!! GLAD I GOT IT FROM THE LIBRARY. 3 SETS OF CHARACTERS - THE FERTERNITY BOYS; THE SLUT GIRLS; AND CHARLOTTE AND NERDS. THAT IS ALL THAT ATTENDED THIS COLLEGE. AGAIN, LET ME SAY, BORING."
1,Needs an Editor,"An exploration of the college years, that difficult period between adolescence and adulthood, should provide an interesting read in the hands of an established author. However Wolfe's stereotyped characters lack depth and often don't ring true. The writing is is lazy and repetitive; some sections read like a rough draft. Too bad no editor had the nerve to tell Wolfe that revisions might have been useful for character and plot development. I was left with the feeling that I'd been dragged through a marathon frat party by several whiney, self-absorbed sock puppets. Also Mr. Wolfe's incessant fixation on a spot several inches below those endlessly exposed navels which he devotes so many pages to, leaves the creepy impression that Wolfe enjoyed himself way too much doing voyeristic research for this book."
1,Worst Wolfe by a wide margin,"There are books where the author takes on the persona of the teen protagonist--Salinger of course, but more recently Tom Perrotta's JOE COLLEGE and Curtis Sittenfeld's PREP come to mind. Then there are books that sound like a 70-year-old man pretending he remotely has a clue about the culture and social norms of today's teens. I AM CHARLOTTE SIMMONS is most definitely the latter.The latest by Tom Wolfe misses the mark in almost every conceivable way. He doesn't know how today's kids talk, act or interact with their peers. It's one of the more disappointing novels I've read in 5-6 years. If Wolfe's name isn't attached to it, this manuscript doesn't see the light of day."
4,On the Mark,"For many of you who think Tom Wolfe was hugely ""over the top"" in his saga of Charlotte Simmons, I can assure you he was more on than off the mark. My own perceptions of campus life come from the rough naratives submitted by my freshman comp students. A few weeks ago I came across a student text that could have been lifted right out of Wolfe's novel. It was replete with the same drunken campus scene with its nudity, pink vomit, and loud cheering - was Hoyt waiting behind the door? Campus talk is crude and the jocks rule. And as Wolfe so carefully observed, students all have cell phones glued to their ears."
2,Too late,"I read this book with no expectations at all. I'm not a huge fan of Wolfe's work in general, but I was pleasantly surprised. It held my attention, it was exciting, I cared for Charlotte, BUT... He's about ten years too late in his expose of campus life. Tom Wolfe went on the Daily Show discussing how wild and crazy campus life is nowadays, when, in fact hasn't changed AT ALL (according to THIS book, at least) since I was in uni, which was a while ago. I found it well written, but dated. It was exactly what an old man might observe once he actually decided to pay attention to the here and now."
5,On the Money,"Wolfe does not have it wrong... all the other reviewers do. As a CURRENT STUDENT, I can say that nothing is more accurate of college life, at least a part of it, than Tom Wolfe's description. His research is perfect, the language is accurate, and the characters are believeable. I honestly did not find one thing in the book to be out of line with what actually goes on in college life today (scary huh?). Deny it all you want... this is what is going on at your son's and daughters's schools. It may not be everyone, but there are certainly plenty of people who fit right in with this book."
1,"""I am Charlotte Simmons"" deserves a D+","Like many of the other reviewers I am a Tom Wolfe fan. I was especially excited to read this book after seeing his interview on the Daily Show with John Stewart. What a let down!The characters are way too stereotyped and contrived. Charlotte herself is a naive snob and in no ways redeems herself in the book and I think causes all of her own drama. Even at the end of the book, she remains a snob and pratically gets off on the Dean of the DuPont and other ""VIPs"" noticing and staring at her.I graduated from undergraduate 3 years ago and I am currently a graduate student. I found very, very little of Tom Wolfe's DuPont in either of my higher ed experiences.Though I do disagree with another reviewer that suggested that Harvard, Yale and Stanford students are not preoccupied with hard bodies and drinking. All colleges have students that obsess over these things. Get your head out of the sand."
5,This is a page turner,"This is a page turner and I definitely recommend it. Tom Wolfe wittily writes about college sports, fraternities, keg parties, and sex through the eyes of Charlotte Simmons, a beautiful freshman at the richly-imagined Dupont University. Through Charlotte, we see the difficult moral, social and individual choices facing college students at universities today. I found the exploration of these issues wrapped in a good story to be quite rewarding. It made me reexamine my preconceptions about university life and values today. I found the book engaging and valuable."
4,Sort of Predictable,"I definitely enjoyed reading this book. There are a couple of slow parts to get past, but overall it is a good read. I would recommend this book to someone who has been to college, or at least has an idea of college because I believe that the stereotypes in the book aren't very accurate. Also, I thought that the conclusion was very predictable."
3,My 1st Tom Wolfe Experience,"This is the first book I have read (listened to) by Tom Wolfe - and it was not at all what I was expecting. He is obviously very intelligent and is a fantastic writer - his use of vocabulary is amazing - but the writing style of this book somehow just doesn't mesh with the plot. It is about Charlotte Simmons' college experience, which is very much like the college experience most girls have - nothing remarkable about that. I will admit that I got into the story - I listened to the audiobook on my commute to and from work and often wanted to just sit in the car when I arrived at my destination to hear what would happen next. But the overwritten quality got annoying after a while (nobody in the history of the world, except maybe Tom Wolfe, thinks of a girl's ""loins"" as ""loamy""). But as far as being entertaining, the book did a great job. :)Also, the narrator was SUPER annoying...he really overdid it on the stereotypes."
4,Hide Your Daughter!,"Set at the fictional equivalent of Duke University (or Stanford or Michigan, per the notes above), Wolfe's latest novel tells the story of a brilliant freshman from rural North Carolina trying to deal with the alien world of a big-time (academically, athletically, socially, sexually and economically) university. ""Hide your daughters!"" seems to be the primary message. Wolfe works hard to get the college lingo and lifestyle right. Carried by Wolfe's style, I breezed through this one quickly, but all I could think along the way was ""Hide your (my) daughter!"" I'll leave it to the reader to find out what happens to Charlotte."
4,I liked it,"A lot of people read this with expectations that Wolf would impart some profound insight into the University system, but I just went into it hoping for a good read. Perhaps I was just nostalgic for college, but the story kept me entertained. I thought the story was a tad on the long side and it could have been shorter, a lot of the descriptions were extraneous. But overall, it was pretty much what I expected."
2,A Far Cry from Before,"Let me first say that Tom Wolfe is one of the greatest living writers in the world. I love his stuff.This book, though, was bad- really bad.There's been a secret to Wolfe's success- he's shown us a world we knew little about or didn't even know existed. Early space, bond trading...these were interesting and foreign to most people. A book about college is not. If the big bang of a novel is that college students do nothing but drinking and sex, you've got a problem. Everybody knows this about college life, and they don't need 500 pages to find out about it, either.The plot is also disappointing. Several interesting sides of the story, like the one about the Republican governor of California's acts at the college, were not explored enough. In fact, this issue resolved/ended itself so quickly that you almost get the impression Wolfe just wanted to finish the darn thing.Well, so did I. I was pretty happy to be done with it."
4,A Cautionary Tale,"Tom Wolfe brings intellectual rigor and soapy fun to what could have been an extension of an MTV reality show. Instead, he has painted a portrait of the modern college campus in gaudy, beer-soaked colors: honest, graphic and poignant. Charlotte is the fish out of water, a country girl forced to swim with the sharks at a large university. This is a cautionary tale for the parent of any impressionable child on the cusp of college entry. It is also vividly entertaining, with an understanding of social mores in the campus microcosm, and a geek vs. jock sub-plot that moves at the pace of an NCAA all-star jetting his basketball toward the hoop."
3,Entertaining but...,"not very realistic. Yes, college life is filled with all of things Mr. Wolfe decribes, but the extremes to which he goes with his characters is over the top. I found the portrayal of Charlotte's naivete annoying. There were moments in the book where I thought to myself that there is no way a girl this age could be thid clueless.By the middle of the book I began hoping that the pressure would get to Charlotte and she would flunk out . Thank goodness for other more interesting storylines to keep this book afloat. I expected better from such a distinguished auhtor."
1,A Grotesque Caricature,"Tom Wolfe clearly has not been to college in the last 50 years, because his portrait of college life is so vastly overblown and beleaguered with every stereotype assigned to today's world of higher education that the story itself is completely lost. There is little that is original or even interesting is his truly one-dimensional novel about a girl who can only be characterized as the single most nave college student on the planet, complemented by every jock and frat boy stereotype that exists in nature. I happen to be familiar with the university this novel is based on and I can say that he appears not to have really delved fully into his research in regard to what college life is like there. I feel a more realistic and not so oversexed and oversimplified novel could have been a successful book. But this just reeks of an old man outside his generation grasping at what he thinks people want to read about college life."
2,Implausible story,"Wolfe takes on American elite Universities and the book has some good parts about the excesses of athletics, intellectual and social pretentiousness, etc but the characters and situations are such gross caricatures of anything I have seen on a campus that the satire looses its power. The evolution of the central character seems quite unlikely and I lost interest halfway through the story. I forced myself to keep reading, hoping that Wolfe would come up with an interesting twist in the story but the end was even weaker than the middle."
2,I Am (a) Tom Wolfe Fan . . . But,"I loved ""The Right Stuff"" and ""Bonfire of the Vanities"". I liked ""A Man in Full"". I thought ""Charlotte"" was a very watered down version of characters already played out in previous novels. I also got very tired of the cynical point of view of the narrator. Every character is VERY self centered. Any minor character that is a good person, is made into a characature to be avoided (i.e. Mom, dad, mentor, friend). I also was very aware of Mr. Wolfe's age in writing about such a Bohemian college. I was not sold on his version of college life today. In summary, I found his characters thin, his storyline boring, and the ending nothing to write about. He has written much better novels. I was very dissapointed."
1,So shallow!,"I could not finish this book. As a college student, I was looking forward to reading this- I was hoping to be able to relate to characters and experience something new and fresh! However, this book was just the opposite: stale and shallow. The characters had all been done before, but this time they are just exaggerated stereotypes of what a 75 year-old man might think they would be. I kept reading, hoping the characters, who were supposed to be endearing, would expand and develop, but they continued to become more and more frustrating. Completely unrealistic and uninteresting, in my opinion!"
5,The novel of the decade.,"As I write this I have not finished reading the novel yet I can already tell that it should be the novel of the decade. When I was at Rice University in the 1970s things were not as bad as they are at Charlotte's fictional (and current) DuPont, but you could see the present day coming. Humans have difficulty achieving balance, and therefore it only stands to reason that once banality becomes acceptable it will be pursued to its logical end. ""I Am Charlotte Simmons"" makes it pretty clear that the logical end of our banal culture is not far off, and it makes you wonder what the aftermath will be like. ""I Am Charlotte Simmons"" is not just a scathing attack on collegiate culture, but on broader American culture as well (after all the super hoops players in the novel have FANS), and must rank alongside the great Billy Wilder Films ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""The Big Carnival"" as a a cultural critique."
2,Does Tom Wolfe think everyone deserves to be made fun of?,"I don't really get what his point is, in general. In all of his books, he seems disdainful of all of his characters...at least I hate all of them when I read about them, and if you're a good author you're trying to portray someone to make the reader feel a certain way about them...right? I wish someone would write a book about Tom Wolfe and portray him as a ridiculous character with ludicrous speech patterns and stupid, laughable habits that he takes for granted and see how he likes it. He seems to be taking out some kind of anger at people, in a very elegant, intelligent way - what a fop! All people want to read is a good story, not a commentary on how stupid everything is. the world is depressing enough. Thanks Tom Wolfe for making me feel like I was at a really bad party for 738 pages. I guess I could have spent a worse flight to Wyoming and back though. But not much worse!"
3,Great book but,"Great story but off the mark, always off the mark. No one can seem to capture the true college life of this generation, and unless some one starts a novel about college well in college... there won't be an accurate story."
1,crass,"What a disgusting read! Did Charlotte grow up in an encapsulated bubble only to be thrown to the inebriated, grossly oversexed majority of a university? The premise of ""genius-girl goes to the big university"" could be fascinating, yet Wolfe gets totally bogged down in elucidating every conceivable raunchy thought, action, deed, fantasy etc. I muddled through it and was depressed at the end. How did I ever make it through college and will I ever allow my children to attend?"
1,Complete waste of time,"Tom Wolfe lost it here. A respected author drops to his perception of an 18 year old freshman in a made-up college, sophmoric result at best. Given the substantial work the author has produced, this amounts to a career suicide attempt. Given the length and scope of his career, the attempt fails, but save your time and money and avoid the book."
2,This can't be our Tom Wolfe!!,"Dear Tom,Nice try, but no....This is not up to your standards and we are all very sad.Please start writing a new novel soon. We still love you and all will be forgotten once your new book comes out!! Baseball would be a wonderful topic right about now...."
3,two-dimensional (at best) characters,"While there is some excellent writing in the form of dialogue and description in this book and the plot moves along well, it is ultimately quite unsatisfying because the characters are just too lacking in soul. Even the title character ends up being just a vapid, status-seeking poser. Granted, Wolfe's descriptions of the narcissitic frat boy character are fun to read (or hear -- I bought it on CD). But while college students are certainly horny and looking to drink (plenty), I seem to recall *some* interest in real friendship, interesting classes, or even (gasp!) altrustic behavior, not just an endless sequence of social and sexual jockeying. I got the feeling we were supposed to take the character's underlying humanity for granted so that we could enjoy Wolfe's skewering unabashedly, but hello -- they don't have it if you don't write it. At least we deserved a cathartic ending we never got. 3 stars is generous."
4,Uncanny and Unvarnished View of a Point in Time,"This novel offers an uncanny view of ""University life"" in the early/mid 2000s. Tom Wolfe has captured the look, feel and texture of a place in time. Everything down to the style of diction...such as statements spoken as questions soliciting affirmation...captures the essence of University life.Mr. Wolfe has written a readable novel that is both illustrative and direct...this is not a book for the faint of heart. The action and language in this book are mature and no topics appear ""off-limits"".As with other Tom Wolfe works, this book ends in a unique, non-conventional manner. This may be a deterrent for those readers interested in clear closure, but I find the conclusion interesting and fitting for this novel.Worth a read."
2,I am... Disappointed,Wolfe went to the extremes of portraying characters/college life. ...and expected the reader to be extremely gullible.
3,Not a masterpiece but still pretty entertaining,"Don't get this book if you're looking for some profound rumination on clashes of culture/race/class. This is the book version of the intelligent romantic comedy with the lead played by Reese Witherspoon. It's not great, but it does not completely suck. You can't be too demanding on someone, even though that someone is Tom Wolfe, one of my favorite all time writers.He is seventy-something trying to write about teenagers. I don't know why he chose this topic...the subject matter would've been better left up to the creators of the OC. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the book for its page turning qualities, and I really thought Wolfe did a good job of creating the complex character of Charlotte. And the school he describes reminds me of my alma mater sans the division I athletic program.Wait for the paperback...it's not a book to save for the library but it's a good read for your commute or day at the beach...if you're into the drama of teenage girls..."
2,"Sorry, it didn't work.","charlotte simmons is a dreary attempt at explaining college life in 2004. Imagine spending the bulk of a Thomas Wolfe novel describing the very unlikely pairing of a country girl and the ""coolest"" frat boy at the out of town prom-or drunken weekend orgy in D.C. Ok, ok, she explored life with booze and sex. These descriptions were as cliche ridden as a second rate romance novel.I'm so disappointed at Wolfe's attempts to somehow link nerds, frat boys, jocks, rich kids, and staff into a coherent tale of the 21st century. Sorry, as much of a fan as I am of Thomas Wolfe, this one just didn't click."
4,bad reviews or sloppy READERS?,"I have to laugh at some of the negative reviews. For example the reviewer who references the stereotypical dumb ""black"" athlete. The athlete was WHITE! What a riot. Go back and read the book!Then there are complaints that there is too much detail provided...facial expressions, college lectures, etc. Don't forget you are READING a book. I think you've all been watching too much tv.Get over yourselves. Kick back and open up a novel. Or better yet, sit up straight and read an encylopedia. Then you'll have nothing to complain about and you can get your facts straight.Charlotte was an enjoyable read. No more, no less. It's not great literature and not rocket science. CHILL."
2,"Almost, but not quite","Tom Wolfe may have captured a generation in some of his previous novels, but he certainly didn't capture mine. As a recent college grad, I found myself often rolling my eyes at how often he had gotten it wrong. I felt very much that a 70 year old man was trying to describe today's college life. Though he may have gone to great lengths in his research, but he missed the boat. A previous reviewer mentioned Wolfe's lack of understanding of female sexuality and I have to agree whole heartedly with this point. In addition, the characters in this novel were too transparent, and well, basically too shallow to get behind. I actually found them all extremely annoying. While the plot was very interesting, there didn't seem to be a point to this 700 page novel, as another review mentioned. Is there really any reason to read this novel?"
4,Powerful prose,"Thanks to Wolfe's powerful prose, a number of vivid characters, and the social commentary about the modern college experience, I enjoyed this novel despite myself. Presumably the reader is supposed to realize that Wolfe is not trying to provide a balanced picture of college life. Chapter 16 exemplifies Wolfe's prose: he immerses the reader into a few minutes of a basketball game in a tour de force worthy of the best first person combat account. On a lighter, although sad touch, who can forget the trolls, Simmons' dorm mates sitting in a row in the hall.Charlotte is not very likable and she is rebelling against two things which are confounded: a set of values, and a lack of money. By page 643 she can hardly bare to touch a blanket which is so ""cheaply synthetic""."
2,Not timeless,"Love Tom Wolfe books ... but guess I should have read this one years ago. The college campus stereotypes may be timeless, but the situations and satire aren't. Cleverly written, as you'd expect from TW ... but not one of his masterpieces by a long shot."
4,"Nails University Life, But Drags Some","Having recently graduated from a fancy private school, I can attest that I Am Charlotte Simmons is a spot-on representation of the contemporary American university. From the hedonism of the student body, to the strange social standing of the athletes, to the self-righteous professors, Tom Wolfe portrays a fictional university so truthful that his novel can't help but be a success. Having created a perfect representation of the modern university, Wolfe, America's greatest living satirist, takes it apart in hysterical detail.Unfortunately, he is unable to keep up the pace for the nearly 700 pages he has given himself, and somewhere near the back third of the book, I found myself wishing he'd wrap it up. To readers who share this experience, I encourage them to trudge it out, because the book's finale is quite satisfying."
1,Poor effort,This book was horrible. It became work just to finish it. A very disappointing effort from an author that is capable of better work.
2,Terrible,This is one of the worst books I've ever read. I was so disappointed. Having recently graduated from college I expected to identify with or at least recognize some of the experiences depicted in the novel. Nope! Everything was generalized or exploited to the point that it becomes a not very flattering caricature of college life. Don't bother with this one.
2,Mr. Wolfe needs a new editor,"When I started this book, a friend of mine said ""He needs a new editor"". And I couldn't agree more. This book could be called ""Bonfire of the Vanities Goes to College."" It's pretty much the same book, but this time Wolfe skewers college students and athletes instead of investment bankers and radical ministers. The characters all share the same ""one-noteness"" which seemed new and interesting in Bonfire, but seems forced and a tad boring in this book. And he does go on and on and on with his descriptions. What would be funny if done in a sentence or two (e.g. , the scene describing the gym habits of the basketball players) turns tedious after the third or fourth page. The story was also predictable. While worthwhile as a cautionary tale for anyone going or sending a child to college in this day and age, the same effect could have been accomplished in far less pages and with far greater success."
3,Dissapointment,"This book was surprisingly bad, but because it kept my attention for the entire 700+ pages I had to give it a three. Although Tom Wolfe did extensive research in order to write the book, it still seemed disconnected from the lives of actual college students. The experiences Charlotte Simmons endures are not unlikely, although they are highly exaggerated. And honestly the ending was really dissapointing, but hey, maybe Tom Wolfe is right, it doesnt matter how smart you are, you will never be liked unless you have a cool boyfriend."
2,long and drawn out,"Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in this book. I was expecting to be enlightened and learn something new. Instead, I found a plot that was nothing different than other college/highschool storylines. I had a hard time finishing the book, and in the end, I didn't really care what happened to the characters. I ended up skipping alot of the pages just to get to the end. A redeeming quality is how well Mr. Wolfe writes and brings characters to life. Too bad I didn't care about them in the long run."
3,Decent Read,"I actually did enjoy reading Wolfe's newest novel. It was incredibly descriptive and a flowing page turner. However, as far as the story line went I was a bit disappointed by the plot including the ending. Overall it was okay."
2,When do the Cliff Notes come out?,"I'll finish this book, but I'm going to have to do it by scanning. Tom Wolfe has gotten so much wrong about university life, has created such unlikable characters, and stretched out so many scenes that could be put into a paragraph, that I really don't know why I'm bothering. I think I'll put it down and read Lucky Jim again."
3,"Enjoyable, occasionally funny read","No, Tom Wolfe doesn't tell us anything new. Yes, most of his characters are caricatures of college ""types."" And he does seem to grab on to certain phrases and use them over and over and over and over and over ""rut rut rut"" ""f*** patois"" etc., that are funny the first few times but then start to get a bit wearisome.Still, it's an entertaining read. Sensitive readers be warned ... it can be offensive at times. I probably wouldn't give it to Mom for Mother's Day."
5,today's college campuses,"I loved this book, so did my daughter. The book hooked her on reading. It seems though that most people refuse to see the importance of the book. Are they ashamed to face the truth?"
3,Mensa Fodder...,"It's vintage Wolfe: Round up every stereotype imaginable, turbocharge them and have some good old rollicking fun. And it works...for the first 400 pages or so. There are some beautiful set-pieces, good characterization and VERY detailed descriptions.But then the whole edifice comes down with a bang, the tone gets nasty and the exercise turns into a chore.Close to the end he lifts the game again but then really drops it: Wolfe must have lost the steam completely and had no idea how to end the book! The last chapter is simply pathetic!"
4,Enjoyable,"An extremely enjoyabe novel if not earth shattering. Familiar territory, but still interesting and well written. Somewhat similar to the voice used in My Fractured Life, Story of My Life, and Prep. A fairly fast read and highly stimulating."
3,Engaging...,"but then again I didn't go to college so I don't know what it is like. I did like the characters and the book kept me interested most of the time. I had to put it down halfway through and then beg myself to finish reading it but once I got going again I couldn't put it down. The ending bombed for me and I feel cheated out of a good story.I loved and despised characters as warranted but wish there had been more to Charlotte and Jojo's relationship, rather than Adam. At times I could have done without the talk about basketball etc and also the sex scenes, but hey this is just my point of view.You will enjoy this book if you aren't looking for some great literary piece, but rather a mindless enjoyable piece about what ""may or may not"" be going on in today's college life."
3,TAT 128,"The ending is no end for Charlotte. Here are some thoughts for her fictive future: before coming into her own, she becomes an Ilsa Lund rather than an Emma Bovary prototype. In a variation on the theme and with a contemporary political brush, she becomes the female version of Victor Laszlo when she finds herself out of college in a new and diametrically opposed environment, where the norm has changed and the effect is also stifling. She is catalyzed into action for a cause. Ultimately, she fulfills her ambition and pursues neuroscience."
3,Disappointing!!!,"I asked for this for Christmas and received it with about 5 other books. I LABORED through it! There are some fun parts, some parts that will resonate as true and others that are just beyond belief. Some charachters just never develop (Beverley) and others are merely contemptable (Hoyt). I wanted to be entertained and, at times, I was. It was just too few and far between for me. The ending stinks, 700 pages and then a quick and unsatisfying wrap. What does Momma think? Miss Pennington? Mr. Starling? Even Charlotte? Read ""The Pledge"" instead."
3,A Mile Too Far,"Book should have been shorter by about 300 pages. Many wonderfully descriptive passages, but one does not need to be hit over the head by excessive repetion to ""get"" the point,(especially using ""gutter"" language)."
3,Hmmm. Sounds a bit like D_ k_ to me,"Right up front I will say that I haven't yet read this book in its entirety, but it does sound like the author might have a certain private NC university in mind,one that claims a history somehow involved with Princeton, one located, where? Durham? Indeed, I know one professor who left this school (and whose tenure there was very successful) in part because he found it to be somewhat like what the author describes in this book. Keep in mind that the truth is almost always stranger than fiction."
3,"Oh, he's a great writer, but a bad novelist","I'm leaving for college and hoped that Tom Wolfe could provide some insight into what life after high school would be like, and while I don't have an answer quite yet, I have the idea it may not be exactly as he portrays it. The goal of a great author should be to create a character people can relate to, and there are times when Charlotte Simmons can be downright unbearable. I enjoyed I Am Charlotte Simmons not because of the story but because Wolfe is an excellent satirist (his 'anatomy' of the uses of certain four-letter words is hilarious) and he keeps you vaguely interested in what will happen. I think the biggest problem with the novel is that it's far too long. You won't want to finish it because it's so difficult to carry around."
2,What ever happened to Tom Wolfe?,"I was once a very big fan of Tom Wolfe. Once an author who picked topics that were current and meaningful, subjects that I felt through his writing, he had full command of . . . where have you gone Tom Wolfe?As a fan of most of your writings, especially in the earlier years, when you didn't back down from voicing your perspective, PLEASE find the fire again . . . I, along with so many other of your readers have been let down recently.In 'I Am Charlotte Simmons' Tom Wolfe brings us into the campus life of young adults trying to find themselves. Typical of Wolfe, his writing style is terrific . . . but no matter how wonderful a writer's style is, if the storyline is meaningless or uninteresting, then who cares?Mr. Wolfe, please don't back down from your gut!"
1,Could put it down.,"A completely awful book with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, written for feebs who get their rocks off by fantasizing about Girls Gone Wild. There are problems on university campuses, notably the neo-pagan worship of wealth and power in the white female body and the replacement of recreational drug use (harmless enough) by the mass consumption of alcohol, which happens to be just as illegal as are drugs under all state laws on all university campuses. But Tom Wolfe has no standing whatsoever on these matters."
3,Good but not.,There seems to be some question about who's the narrator and who's the author. Are these students all being pigeonholed by a naive but status-hungry freshman? or by a cynical old man?
1,Don't waste your precious reading time,a very long book with little point and a highly disappointing ending. main character sucks. so sad for Tom Wolfe.
2,Not as great as I'd heard and hoped....,"I was really excited to read this novel after hearing how fantastic it was. I was disappointed. Did Wolfe capture the essence of college life nowadays? Probably. Did it have the feel of being vulgar just to be vulgar? Yep. Charlotte Simmons character was rather one-sided and got a bit annoying after a while. The length of the book really could have been cut back, too. I wouldn't recommend it as a ""must-read""."
3,Charlotte?,"I have read several of the reviews posted about this novel, and coming from and older person's point of view, they are all correct. I am currently in college and I found this novel to be correct on certain levels. I attend one of the major party schools, so I have seen it all. I do agree that he focused too much on the stereotypical college student, a normal college student's point of view was never brought out to the front. This novel is perfect for those who are looking to entertain themselves with another typical college story or even to look back on their college years to remember all the people that they associate with the main characters, but as far as being adequate account of ""real"" college life its not."
5,Interesting Social Commentary,The multiple and compelling story lines weave into the fabric of the book so smoothly. A complex and unique window into higher education and more importantly how society looks at elite institutions.
4,A great romp and rant,"While it may not be his best any Wolfe book will still be miles higher than most other trash on the current bestsellers list. Some felt it didn't catch college life as it is today. Having a daughter in a big school right now I can assure you that, what has been on display, certainly seems accurate in Wolfe's book. Some have felt his characters to be wooden. All of his novels work characters as archetypes and let's face it one of the main themes in Charlotte is the very hollowness of these students. Nonetheless the plot and character driven elements are, albeit pessimistic, great fun. Tore through the book and had a blast while also being reminded of the sad decline and continued power structures that define colleges. It is ultimately not a bright future for our brightest and the faults are many."
4,Disturbingly Accurate,"For me, Wolfe's detailing of both the academic and social spheres at Dupont rang true. As a student at a university driven by both scholarly research and the party scene, I can picture many of the novel's more dramatic scenes. Some, like the Saint Ray party toward the beginning or the intimidating neuroscience lecture hall, I felt as if i were remembering rather than reading.No, there is no university quite like Dupont, succeeding in academics and sports at the highest levels. If he had not given the school these characteristics, however, Wolfe might have put himself at a disadvantage: There would be less of a chance for a reader to identify with the university, the characters, the scenes, and his commentary would have been limited to fewer aspects of today's campuses. A novel about an UNDERachieving university might be interesting as well, but I think the scope of I Am Charlotte Simmons, and Dupont in particular, was well suited to Wolfe's acute powers of observation."
3,Interpretive focus,"Adam has more to fill in himself, to prove, and to vindicate than Charlotte does; therefore, I think, he has larger hurdles in his future. Charlotte could possibly find a niche in academia &/or a role in family life that can feel comfortably familiar. She is a different model for the future when details additional to gender are relevant. Neither is a legend in their own time. What to do with that when the alternative is to feel deeply lacking. If they can find a solution that betrays no one, including themselves, and maintains dignity and security, there can be a positive outcome. One starts from where they are, looks for supportive and understanding friends and family, and goes from there. An opinion."
5,his best novel so far,"This book is gripping, one of those books you stay up long into the night reading 'cause you can't put it down. It's full of many gems of description--gym culture, for instance, as well as humor, poignancy and wisdom. I am happy to say that one of the greatest writers of this century is still firing on all cylinders."
2,Whiny Soap Without a Single Likable Character,"Wow - what happened to Mr. Wolfe? A brilliant social observer, a man who loves assuming the role of stranger in a strange land delivers a novel unworthy of the word. At first glance it seemed to have potential: a naive, gorgeous, aw-shucks gal with 1600 SAT scores enrolls in an ivy-league university and quickly finds herself facing a multitude of integrity & morality tests. A setting fat with material for thought-provoking commentary, wouldn't you think? Well you'd be oh-so-wrong, my friend. This was page after page of mind-pickling tripe. Whiny diatribes about the unfairness of teachers, the duplicity of boys (gasp!), the thrill of being popular. Who cares???? Even when I'd given up on depth of insight, I still hoped I'd encounter someone for whom I could root. Nada. Not only did I not enjoy this book, I actively disliked it. Aaron Spelling, I've found your newest writer. Take him - please."
3,Well Written and a Must Read but Not Too Deep,"The bad reviews here say that it was unrealistic for a senior male from New York to write a novel about a young Christian woman from the south who goes to an Ivy League University and gets ""corrupted"". While it is quite possible he knows someone like Charlotte, it is more likely he knows her socially conservative parents as it does seem to be clear he hasn't socialized with someone like her as an equal for quite a while. Still, the story was a good read. I would say that Tom Wolfe is most unrealistic when he describes modern American universities as a debauched world of mindless ""hook-ups"" and people ""not dating seriously"". There is plenty of evidence that lots of great looking young men are not having any fun at all in college as they don't know what to do or say. It has probably always been this way. Wolfe seems to have researched the college scene enough to repeat slang used in the early 2000s like ""dormcest""."
4,Good Beach Book,"An innocent savant comes down from the hills of eastern North Carolina where she had lived a sheltered life for her first seventeen years; with a full-ride academic scholarship in hand she joins an elite eastern university with its share of the moneyed, the snobs and the self-indulgent. Her only protection is that she is Charlotte Simmons.Tom Wolfe's scathing indictment of contemporary college life is excellent, proving once again that he is a master of character development and irony. He portrays the hedonism of the fraternity/sorority system, the treatment of the ""mercenary"" class of athletes and the loneliness of being on the outside and poor, all the while struggling to maintain one's values. Wolfe draws very clear distinctions of not just college but society in general.The book can be crude and at times a bit like ""Animal House on steroids"" but all in all an enjoyable and fast read."
4,Charlotte Simmons and the crisis of educational leadership,"Tom Wolfe could have written the same book in half the pages. He makes the novel a tale of morality, when what he is really writing about is the crisis of leadership in American Universities. Since we cannot agree on what ""Good"" means in this country, elite bastions like the fictional ""Dupont University"" are collision courses of self interest, pride, ego, and other lowest common denominators (made manifest through drugs and sex). When no one is prepared to provide the leadership to say, ""We stand for something,"" then anything goes. I happen to agree, but would have enjoyed the novel more in 250 pages, and an essay on leadership, not morality, would have been more interesting."
1,A huge disappointment,"I've been a fan of Tom Wolfe's work, but this was terrible. The characters were all so conceited, poorly developed, and annoying that I couldn't bring myself to care what happened to them. It was clear the novel was written by someone who doesn't understand what college kids are like. It seems like Wolfe got some ""insight"" from other people and then tried to force that into just about every line of the novel. The whole novel felt forced and was almost painful to read."
3,Wolfe Fan's,"For those who are a Thomas Wolfe fan...you might read it, otherwise you may want to pick one of his other books. I enjoyed it just because Wolfe wrote it; not to say it isn't worth reading if you still can relate to your college freshman year. (I almost still can!)"
3,"Not bad, but I've read better","Tom Wolfe has written some wonderful books, and the reviewers of this one get it close to right. College in any generation is far more interesting than a mere chronicle of modern day malaise. It is about the angst of coming of age, and the uncertainties of adulthood. But let's face it, Tom Wolfe isn't trying to be JD Salinger, he's more of a journalist turned social commentator. For the best book I've read on college life, check out The Big Kids by Robert Hennemuth. It's a great read."
3,Definitely could have been better,"Well this book wasn't terrible, but not great either. The worst part was the main character-bleh. She is so incredibly self centered you just want to reach in and shake her. It's also hard to believe that anyone could be so naive in today's world. She's never watched tv or read a book or magazine written in the last 20 years? I realize Wolfe is using her as a lens through which we see this depraved college world, but his descriptions of college life are overblown as well. It's too bad, because some of his details are funny and right on, but most of it is just too sensational and overdrawn. With some serious editing, this book might have been ok, as it is, I'd pass if I were you."
1,"Overmarketed, overwritten, overwrought","Mr. Wolfe just came to not one but three bookstores near me to sell this book and I must say, I can see why he needs to. In fact, all the bookstores emphasized that he WOULD NOT sign any of his other books--I could sympathize with the earlier review about the fan who was harassed in the library (a library?!)for trying. Having been able to get his other, good books, onto the bestseller lists without having to personally sign each and every one, Mr. Wolfe seems to be exerting great labors to sell this one because it takes great labors to read it. I finally gave up on page 300, tried, and tried again, but after the umpteenth jarringly ""off"" cultural reference and umpteenth rapturious description of male ""abs and pecs,"" and umpteeth cardboard do-people-really-talk-in-expository-sermons character monologue had to slam it shut forever."
3,A lot of style for a story that says very little,"I think many of the reviewers on this site and many of the professional reviewers have summed up my sentiments about this book: it's prose is engaging, and its characters are fully realized, but the message comes across as nothing more than an old man complaining about a new generation of college students. All you have to do to know the theme of the story is read Wolfe's prologue, which explains a scientific experiment wherein chimps alter their behavior because of group influence. Don't get me wrong, this is an entertaining book, and I had no problem spending hours with it. Its just that the ending is disappointing and leaves you with very little."
3,Hidden agenda,"For the first time, after reading almost all of Tom Wolfe's books, I feel that he may have had a hidden agenda in this one. Was it autobiographical (i.e. the student reporter who pursued the shock story)? But then maybe he was one of the ""anointed"" while in college, maybe a Vance Phipps? There was so much gratuitous political trashing of the Republican party that I began to suspect that was the intended point of the story. Wolfe usually leaves the reader with some idea of what the point of the story was, but either I missed something or he didn't get it across this time. Or am I right about the politics?"
4,OK Book,"These are all things that I do regularly in college. It's not a big deal. Everyone does it! I guess I was expecting more than I got out of the book. The System by Roy Valentine is a better book on college sex, partying etc. But don't worry about Charlotte Simmons - she'll grow up to be a good boring desperate housewife like she was taught before going off to college."
2,Unfortunate Waste of Time,"You will finish this book if you start it, but you will not be happy. Wolfe portrays pieces of college life accurately, however he is overly simplistic. He really doesn't understand what he is writing about, and it is a painful read as he tries to write as a maturing women. Charlotte is so annoying at the end it is nearly unbearable. I found myself muttering ""Get over it!"" constantly.The greatest offense in this book is Wolfe's characterization of African Americans. Every African American in this book is an athlete and he constantly refers to the fact that they are black (we got it after you mentioned that the first time Tom). He clearly did not do much of his much talked about research with any African American students. His portrayal of the African American student as a dumb athlete, fresh out of the projects, just trying to make it to the league is just an old, tired stereotype.This book was a big disappointment and a real waste of time at 676 pages."
