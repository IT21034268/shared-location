3,Convincing but not worked through,"This book convinced me of the truth of evolution, but the author has not well worked out the conclusions/applications. HE does not deal with the laws (anti-discrimination, anti-apartheid) that prevent human evolution of continuing and force instead a common breeding. Politicians need to read this book and adapt the laws according to the selection and evolution of the races with the most fitted genes."
2,Keep your friends close....,"This is must reading, but mainly to know what to expect from those who will take up these old and tired arguments about how evolution works at the level of the gene. I get tired of reading popular science books where one author pats another author on the back who pats their author-friend on the back, and so on, in a bought of reciprocal altruism. The Selfish Gene sits at the top of a giant chain letter, where those at the bottom of the chain (the readers) pay the price. When reviews are posted here saying that Dawkins' ideas have stood the test of time, they are correct, but only in the popsci circles. Real peer-reviewed papers in biological journals say otherwise, Ridley notwithstanding."
5,"It's a metaphor, people","Dawkins started writing ""The Selfish Gene"" in 1972. With the ever accelerating advances in science, one would think such a book would be horribly outdated by now, but I found this to not be the case at all.I'm halfway through my undergrad studying Biology and Chemistry, so I'm not an expert in the field (yet), but I'm not the ""layman"" reader that Dawkins had in mind when writing this either. I found it to be quite interesting and educational. I wasn't exactly burning through every page, but Dawkins captivated my attention more than not. Chapter 12 alone makes the book worth reading.Regardless of your background in science, ""The Selfish Gene"" is worth the read."
5,a revolutionary work of science,"One of the most important science books of the twentieth century! Dawkins revolutionized the way we think about evolution.The Selfish Gene is a fascinating book that changed they way I look at the world. It explains how creatures evolved as means for their genes to replicate themselves. The genes are the drivers of life, the bodies are their vehicles.This book and E. O. Wilson's Sociobiology were the two pioneering works in the field of evolutionary psychology. Unfortunately, to this day The Selfish Gene remains the most important book in that field. Many evolutionary psychology writers since Dawkins have moved farther away from Science and a lot deeper into the world of speculation and ""just so"" stories.Richard Dawkins managed to upset many simple minded creationists. Their faith is apparently not strong enough or else they wouldn't bother to argue with scientists."
3,Gene review,"The Selfish Gene: 30th Anniversary Edition--with a new Introduction by the AuthorThis book is a hard ""read"" The author is not concise. He belabors some points."
5,the barely known/never taught spin on things,the take on genetics and our genes that you would never even think it could be. but after reading dawkin's words the apparent truth is revealed. is it us being us or just the selfish little gene at play?
5,A wonderful book,"With THE SELFISH GENE, Dawkins has set the pace for scientific thinking in the 21st century. The book has influenced new thinkers like David Deutsch and Paco Ahlgren. I strongly recommend this work."
1,"If I could give this less than one star, I would!","Absolute fluff. Pseudo science at its most apologetic, hateful worst. It just goes to show that statistics, in the hands of anyone with an axe to grind, can be dangerous. The worst part is that it is well-written tripe. On the surface, the main argument seems logical. Too bad it's not science! Terrible. Worse than terrible - dangerous and misleading!"
1,Consider the source,"Richard Dawkings is a very intelligent militant atheist that cannot get past his own biased worldview. He is not capable of handling anyone who disagrees with him and typically will say his detractors are insane.This book is a masterful treatise on micro-evolution. However there is no debate on whether micro-evolution happens / happened.The issue is macro-evolution which Dawkins as yet (or anyone for that matter), has been able to provide any scientific evidence."
5,Material on game theory can be applied broadly,"The Selfish Gene provides an excellent outlook onevolutionary biology, especially with its references to evolutionary game theory. His chapter discussing J. Maynard Smith's ""Hawk and Dove"" and ""War of Attrition"" game models is very insightful and has multiple applications to the social sciences. As a budding economist, this book provided me with the biological reasoning behind co-operative and non-cooperative economic game theory as they relate to bargaining and contracting between agents. A must read for anyone interested in everyday human decision making."
5,Dawkins + Complexity Theory = Enlightened Humans,"If I was cursed with banishment, I would take two books with me: Dawkin's ""Selfish Gene"" and Waldrop's ""Complexity : The Emerging Science at the Edge of Order and Chaos"".Dawkin's book offers an eloquent, bulletproof, and easy to understand gestalt of biology on Earth. His arguments are incredible simple, logical and indisputable. The sense of truth, of REAL truth, you get while reading this book will truly raise your awareness to another level.Combine the well-researched and excellent anecdotes with the Complexity paradigm, and you will truly have the tools to understand the cosmic questions that tortures some of us.If you are questing for the answers to the ""big"" questions, these two books will answer them for you. If this is your first foray into biology or game theory, I suggest you start with a little more of the basics - it will make reading this book an even more rewarding experience."
5,The Book That Began My Love For Reading,"Yes, I too remember this book. I checked out this book as a 3rd grader, (around 1982) from my elementary school. That is the last time I have ever seen a copy in existance. I still remember the wonderful adventures of the ghost cat in her many lives. I loved this book. I must have checked it out at least 10 times (determined to finish it). The librarian had to tell me that I could only check it out one more time that school year. This is the book that began my love for reading. I really hope somebody will have it in their heart to bring it back into print for future readers to enjoy. I have not been able to find a single copy since my 3rd grade year. If you have a copy, do not hesitate, open it now and share the magic with the children in your life. It is definitly an experience I will never forget. I pray doesn't just fade away into the abyss of bygone books."
3,Not what it seems,Pretty cheap. You would think one handle is hot the other is cold...nope one is hot/cold the other turns the water on. It isn't the best quality and don't know how long it will last.
5,"An epic, historic masterpiece","I'm at a loss for words to describe the scope, stature and relevance of this film which paints an enlightening portrait of modern conflict by portraying actual events from 1000 years ago. Certainly, this is the most ambitious first feature I've seen from a new director, reminiscent of how my jaw dropped the first time I saw Spielberg's debut ""DUEL"" air on network television. This is a seminal piece that I strongly recommend."
2,TV Movie Quality,"If you are looking for a 'masterpiece' this movie is NOT it. The overall feel is of a TV movie, but it looks as though there were at least two directors so the pacing and flavor are haphazard. I had to force myself to stay through to the end. If you want to see a historical movie of 'masterpiece' quality see ""Mongol"". Then come back and try to watch this. For the record, I love the Rubaiyat itself and will watch just about anything involving it."
1,"propaganda for a continued ""religious"" war","Not what I expected, this film promotes ideas like disregarding childrens' safety to continue spreading lies about a culture that treats women like slaves and property. Also that it is just fine to stab a friend to continue a family's royal birthright at the cost of other people lives. One idea that it correctly portrays is that people who speak English are the only capable of safegarding Arabic history, as seen by the woman in England wo has the priceless text."
3,Hard for Beginners,"I'm not really a beginner guitarist, but i wanted to learn more on guitar theory which is why i got this book. I already knew a pretty decent amount though but i wanted to learn theory relating to the guitar. This book can be VERY confusing and there are even typos, for eg. they have the A harmonic minor with an A# on the octave in the scale finder. Or they tell you that the difference between the Harmonic Minor and the Natural minor is that you raise the 6th note in a Harmonic Minor a half step when you're really raising the 7th. This can cause people to get reallllly frustrated and confused and have to seek different sources for an explanation on these contradictions. Also, the way they explain a lot of stuff is so rediculously difficult i almost think theyre TRYING to confuse me. But otherwise if you can figure these things out yourself it's a great book because it covers so much."
2,Very Annoying,I strongly agree with the comments here about the two extra lines on the chord diagrams - very confusing. And the typos are very annoying. It's frustrating to try a chord with fingering that's physically impossible to achieve. Is it me? Is it this guitar tutor expert? The author should have checked and rechecked the proof before going to print.Good effort otherwise.
1,Mistakes Mistakes......,A student of mine brought this book to a lesson because we talked about the major scale modes the week prior. There's a section explaining the modes and he questioned fingering. I looked closely and it was wrong!The C Mixolydian diagram was really C Aeolian!!! There was another diagram that I forgot that was not only wrong it wasn't even a scale!!!!Great idea for a book but please get some proof readers and revise it.
4,Will love it later,"This book contains all I'll ever want to know about playing a guitar and much much more. For a beginning guitar student it's a bit overwhelming, but for the serious experienced guitar player who's ready to move on to a new level of playing, it's like acquiring a set of ""guitar encyclopedias"". Well worth the money."
1,This book does not deliver what it promises,"I bought this book on the strength of the claim that it makes the difficult subject of logic accessable to computer scientists. I was very disappointed to find a book steeped in formulaic arcana and obtuse descriptions. The author does not ""clarify the relationships between logic languages, functional languages, and object oriented languages"" as promised in the Booknews review. Apparently the author thinks clarity is found in logic formulas, but most of us prefer actual clear, concise English-language sentences."
1,so very very bad....,"ugh - couldn't even get through 10 minutes of it --- anyone who managed to make money in the production, acting, etc related to this film should be subjected to the placement of their earnings to charity.I do not know of any words/phrases to describe the horror that is this filmStupidity on a GRAND scale."
2,this movie was too Taboo,"Taboo is about a bunch of preppy friends, Nick Stahl (Bully, Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines), January Jones (Anger Management, American Wedding), Amber Benson (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Can't Hardly Wait), Lori Heuring, Eddie Kaye Thomas (American Pie 1-3, Freddy Got Fingered) and Derek Hamilton who play a little game of yes or no with simple questions and one year later they reunite but some one starts to play games with them as they all end up dieing with words that discripe what they are but they eyes are decieved with lies and secrets. In the end it's too Taboo and too predictable so you know what the hell is gonna happen. Nick Stahl is the only fuel that keeps this thing going also with some interesting writing and direction. January Jones is just too much of a annoying (beep). Anyway you get my drift, hopefully"
1,"Stupid, Nasty, Homophobic, Offensive! Horrible Movie.","Deserves no stars! The cover gives off a Cruel Intentions/Teens sex out of control look but its really a stupid ,pathetic murder motive jelousey movie thats homophobic and just plain offensive on so many levels. Avoid this garbage at all coasts. Shame on Nick Stahl!"
2,No surprises in this one,"Anyone who paid attention to the clues given during the movie could solve this ""mystery"" way before they wanted to enlighten us. This movie was supposed to be an intelligent thriller, but it isn't much more than a slasher movie in disguise.Still, it's a fun watch if you're having a horror movie bash."
3,Entertaining,"I thought this movie was a very entertaining movie. It was boring in some parts and didn't make sense in others but overall it was an ok movie. I am a Nick Stahl fan and really like him as an actor. So, if you are also a Nick Stahl fan I do recommend this movie."
2,Weak movie with well-known actors,"This movie is perhaps the worst flawed film I've seen. I found that I really didn't care about any of the characters except to laugh at their foolishness. While I really dislike the film, the few moments that Amber Benson portrays Piper were humourous. I bought the film because I liked Amber Benson. Long Story short - ""Taboo"" isn't really a well-made film, so I'd only purchase it If you enjoyed the actors' other works."
4,A Needed Approach,"This book is well researched and well written. And it is a good thing that, for a change, the ""civilians"" get their say-so and that their fate in war and battle is honored. I find it a slight flaw, though, that the author gave relatively short shrift to the military side of this conflict, especially the reasoning of the Union commanders.The maps could be better, and should be listed in the frontispiece. They are hard to find. But the illustrations are superb."
3,The Stronghold-Richmond,"Richmond was not unlike Washington. Jeff Davis was here along with the southern military. The city was filled with hospitals. The paper and its reporters along with the wealthy and the average people helped make up the city. Spies were everywhere and ladies of the night were available. Four years of war with the Union Army's eyes always on Richmond. This is interesting story and a very informative book about Richmond. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
4,fun toy!,this a cool bionicle. if you turn the knob in the back both of the arms fling forward to knock off th rahi's mask. it is pretty cool.
3,Poor W.A.R DVD,"This DVD was boreing. It would make you want to sleep even before you reach the first hour of this DVD. However, the quality of instructions presented by the pilots were so good and covered new stuff that other World Air Routes DVD's pilots did not cover. In addition to that the cabin flight from Dusseldorf to Palma was entertainning. Other than that I wouldn't recommend you wasting your cash on this DVD."
5,I LOVE THIS SHOWER CURTAIN,"THIS SHOWER CURTAIN IS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED AND ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFU !! I DO PUT A CURTAIN LINER CURTAIN ON THE SHOWER SIDE TOO BUT WHO WOULDN'T. THE FABRIC IS SO FLOUNCY, ELEGANT AND SOFT - BUT YET VERY DURABLE.THE SELLER IS GREAT TO DEAL WITH, FAST DELIVERY, EXCELLENT COMMUICATION AND GREAT PRICES FOR SUPERIOR MERCHANDISE. WHO COULD ASK FOR ANYTHING MORE ??"
3,An author to keep an eye on!,"Set in Ireland. Davnat Ni Cinnede was to marry a Norman for peace. During her betrothal feast, however, appeared Parthalann. Their Fates had been decided long ago by the Gods. The betrothal feast blazed with fire and blood as they fled.Parthalann had been a Druid, but decided to choose the path of a Warrior. He was to train Davnat in the Druid ways. She already knew healing from wise women and had learned to fight as a warrior all her life. Davnat and Parthalann were to have only a short time together, but their love would last forever and their sons would someday change the world!*** A great plot, but way too short. It seemed as if much was left out of the story. The tale was fantastic though and the author shows much talent! Shanna Murchison is an author to keep an eye on! ***"
3,Too short for this plot,"Set in Ireland. Davnat Ni Cinnede was to marry a Norman for peace. During her betrothal feast, however, appeared Parthalann.

5,Epic Portrait,"This is an epic portrait of absolute power corrupting absolutely. It tells the story of a man who was determined to put his imprint on New York City. He certainly achieved it for better or worse. If people are fascinated by HBO's Boardwalk Empire or the first two films of the Godfather, they will absolutely love this story of an unelected city official who played master puppeteer and master builder of New York City. He controlled real estate and city development in NYC unlike any public figure before or since. Caro paints an illuminating portrait of a man who has inspired the birth of many neighborhood activist organizations all over the country. They were a reaction to Moses' brand of ""my way or the highway concrete jungle city planning"". He found the perfect nemesis in Jane Jacobs' thoughtful, livable, walkable, community ideal."
5,The Power Broker : Robert Moses and the Fall of New York,"This book can be one of the best I have read in a while. It brings to the surface more about Robert Moses than I ever knew. Its a page turner, as a matter of fact I just took some time to write this and now I must be going.Marcos"
4,required reading in our house,"""Robert Moses, he was a great man may he rot in hell,"" is a common expression in New York, especially for those New Yorkers who lived through his nearly 50-year reign as a never-elected public servant of the City. From the Triborough and Verrazano Bridges, to the city and state parkways, the famous Jones Beach (and its complete inaccessibility to public transportation, thanks to Moses' conscious decision to build overpasses too low to allow buses to get there) and the displacement of nearly 100,000 New Yorkers in the Bronx to build an expressway, not to mention both the 1939 and 1964 World's Fairs, Robert Moses left a mark more permanent in New York City than any mayor or developer in his time. For anyone who wonders how cities are built - and how opportunities to make them even more livable are lost - The Power Broker is a must-read."
5,Incredible,"One of the top three books I have ever read.A stupendous story about an astounding man told by a master author.A man who literally shaped Manhattan and New York State, for better or probably worse."
5,More praise,"My praise has to pale beside the mountain of kudos this book has received. The best book ever about power in America, the best book about the recent history of New York City, the best book about city planning."
5,A Must Read Book!,"Robert Caro's THE POWER BROKER is a lession in the use of power in the life and career of Robert Moses, and the consequent effects upon the people and substructure of New York City. Moses is such a disgusting figure, such a tyrant, that I literally found myself shaking at points. The press was in his pocket, elitest and racist, Moses painted himself as the selfless public servant. In reality, he cast people aside by the thousands in order to increase his power and accomplish what he wants. What a vile man. I'll never look at New York City the same again and I pray that I would never treat people the way he did."
5,Monster of NY,"Having read Caro's books on LBJ, I just had to read this Pulitzer Prize winning bio. I was not disappointed. Dare I say Moses was New York City's own little Hitler! There is very little to admire about this man who tore great holes in NYC and catered to the rich. Read how he made sure that the overpasses that ran over the parkways that he built were made intentionally too low for busses to pass under. In doing that he insured that only those who could afford a car could get to his wonderful beaches. He also destroyed neighborhoods and people. Blind with ambition he only cared about building monuments to himself. You will not beleive how he stole power in NY and became the most powerful man in this country - even Roosevelt was beholden to him. He personally held the purse strings to the largest sums of money in the State and probably the nation. But it is a great story and well written. If you live and work in NYC you should not miss this one."
5,"great to read on the subway, but only if you've got a seat","Although I have lived in NYC most of my life, I never understood how it got this way until I read Robert Caro's book. It was beautifully written, even dramatic.If you consider yourself a ""real"" New Yorker, I urge you to read this book- it will inform your every day life. It also makes terrific subway reading- but it's a little heavy to read while standing."
5,One great book!,"This is the finest political book of our generation. If you really want to understand politics you must read this book. Do not be put off by the size of the book. Like ""War and Peace"" it will be worth the effort."
2,Some regrets,"I didn?t pay much attention to the description of the book, something that proved to be an error. Unfortunatly, i intented to buy a large book with paintings in a more adequate size, and this book is to small to really capture the details of Klimt?s work, despite of its fine printing."
2,book,"it was a good quality book with great images, but much smaller than i expected. but it was a great book regardless for a lover of klimt."
5,Open your eyes . . .,"I had no knowledge of this artist before receiving this book as a Christmas gift. What a wonderful, enlightening book!The book has large plates of about 40 works, and smaller black and white prints of some others (including a number that were destroyed in a 1945 fire). The contrast between the exquisitely expressive faces, drawn with the precision of a renaissance master, and the wild, unrestrained clothing and background is captivating.The author provides a good biography and helpful insights into the allegorical interpretation of the various works. A real bargain here."
3,KLIMT by Gottfried Fliedl,"My disappointment comes from the printing process rather than the content,which is chock full of color plates of Klimt's paintings and some greatphotos of Klimt's life and times.All of the color plates and the photos are printed soft-edged and the wonderful vibrant golds are somehow absent. None the less, it is a lovelybook with a very good text and a marvelous range of his work."
5,Beautiful Color Reproductions!!,"Klimt is my favorite artist and yet it is so difficult to find quality reproductions of his works; usually the color is faded or the gold leaf comes out a sickly yellow!! This book has beautiful reproductions and concise and informative explanations next to each painting as well as an interesting biography on Klimt. I highly recommend this book for a clear, concise overview."
5,"Onua and how he's my,""friend""","This very powerful toa is very fun to have. His claws are one of my favorite weapons. Even though they can't come to life, I still play with him like he's my best friend! Onua is still one of the hardest toa to put together. He's just a bit different because he's crouched over. I think it's pretty silly when his mask falls off. His mask falls off real easy(and I don't know why).....So out of all of the toa, Onua is my favorite!"
4,Good book about the Marines in the Pacific,"I wouldn't rate it as good as I would the ""With the Old Breed at Pelielu and Okinawa"" but it was a good read nonetheless."
4,strong men armed,excellent book i would recommend reading this book to anyone this is a master piece by someone who lived through an ordeal and gave tremendously for the fight for piece and his country
5,MARINES!,"This is the epic struggle of the WW II island hopping marines their ins and outs and shining moments that will last forever. Robert Leckie certainly captures the mood of the men and who went fourth to send the enemy reeling. From the first days on Guadalcanal to the bitterest fights for ground on Okinawa, Leckie really brings their struggle home. This is a must read."
5,How did I miss this book?,"It would not be a great exaggeration to say I have been reading military history from birth...My only comment is how did I miss this book over the years. I have yet to read a more comprehensive review of the USMC in the Pacific during five decades plus of reading. This is a great book. It will be on my Kindle for a long time.My father was a Korean War era Marine. His disdain for Dugout Doug MacArthur has always been a puzzle to me, but I have a handle on his discontent now. Semper Fi."
3,Buy it if you want a horse racing Jupiter,"When you read reviews, you really should be careful what's the reviewer's priorities when rating an item.I felt so refreshed when I first heard this cd and had had to buy it. But after a few times it just doesn't sound interesting anymore.I give it 3 stars for Minkowski's brave attempt but sorry a fast tempo doesn't buy me.I was looking for something with grandeur, refinement, and grace. Regarding my criteria, there are many better options out there."
4,Skill Router 1825-RT,The first router I received was defective. The plunge base would hang up and the motor wouldn't rev up to its designed RPM. The unit was obviously not reconditioned as advertised. I received a replacement a week later and the unit works great.
5,great router!,"Okay, having bought some refurbished tools before and being disappointed, this router really was a nice surprise. The only thing I could see that was used were some very minor scratches on the case. I've used this router to finish my deck railings and to make mouldings. It is easy to use, the handles are ergonomic and the controls are right there ready to use. I put the router in a table, the micro adjust is a little stiff, but totally usable (just support the unit's weight as you make adjustments). I had no issues cutting a 1"" wide channel in redwood using 1/4"" increments for the depth (plenty of horse power). I have yet to use the plunge base, but it appears to be of the same quality as the rest of the unit. I really find the built in light useful. The slide lever to lock the chuck is a nice feature, makes for a quick change of bits (wrench and 1/4"" collet adapter included). All in all, I'd recommend to anyone who is looking for a good router at a great price."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Both planet and book not as interesting as Mars, physically or written.A family conflict dominates this book. One dead brother from a preivous Venus mission. One not in the best of shape and healthy decidedly not studly Roger Ramjet astronaut type, and an incredibly wealthy overbearing father. The brother wants to get his dead relative's body back, the father wants cash.This was not very interesting at all, unfortunately."
2,Nothing to chew on here...............,"Even going in with low-low expectations, I was amazed by how amateur this production proved to be. The acting was painful to watch, the fight sequences were so lame, the story was over ripe....leaving me hard pressed to find any redeeming feature worth boasting about. Oh yeah, it was also too long by 101 minutes.Not a keeper."
3,Not High On The Zombie Radar...,"This could have been better. Production is good. Acting is ok. Still, something is missing. I truly enjoy zombie films. This one needed a rewrite."
2,Average,"The movie wasn't to bad just needed better acting, the plot wasn't bad either zombie's makeup poor.I would rate 2 and half stars due to budget costs, something you could watch on redbox."
3,Better Than Some...,"Well, this was better than some zombie movies, but on the lower end of a grade-B movie.It was fun seeing Fred Williamson back in action, but he was better in From Dusk Till Dawn.All in all, good for a few laughs and better than some...."
4,Rather liked this,"I'd seen the part one thingee -- so was hesitant on this but, have to say all Indy-film aspect aside, I did enjoy it. Film values were good and the zombie make up was not horrible - more of a human drama but did have some REAL good and tensed up zombie moments -- so I'd suggest if you like zombie films as much as i do - don't heistate to add this to your collection."
1,Holy Smokes This Was A Stinker!,"I'm a huge zombie fan.....HUGE! I've read almost all the zombie books, seen all the zombie movies, I have lots of zombie T-shirts, a zombie hunter permit on my truck, I LOVE ZOMBIE STUFF! And I could not sit through this DVD. It was HORRIBLE! The characters were cartoonishly bad, the editing was horrible and don't even get me started on the zombies. Zombies that growl and have fighting skills???? Not a chance. I can deal with slow zombies, ""28 Days Later"" fast zombies or ""The Walking Dead"" kinda quick zombies. But I can't deal with these. I wanted to like it, I just couldn't. Save your money."
1,They should be charged with fraud for making this movie!,Horrible cant even describe the acting. And then there is the low budget. Horrble story line. Did I mention that the acting was bad?I bought this movie...watched 15 minutes of it...then threw it in the garbage. And I never throw movies away.Did I mention that the acting was bad?
1,"Awfull!,","This was a very bad movie, I wouldn't recommend to anyone. The story line was poor , the actors were not convincing,was waste of time"
2,movie collector,"the other night a wanted to see another zombie movie so i jumped on amazon and looked at a few different ones and i came across zombie apocalypse , ok i love all types of movies i have a very large collection ( 2500+) dvds , well i was reading the reviews of this one and seeing the high star rating ..........ok what rating level are these people using ? for $9+ s/h this was a joke now i would buy it if it was .99 cents , it was more about human vs human than anything about zombies that was its biggggggggggg down fall ! for being a b grade movie it was ok , the opening telling about what happened after the zombies was really nice i like that alot but way to much good guys verse bad guys thing it really needs more about zombies ! i would buy it again if!!!! it was about $6 bucks cheaper , ive learned my lesson about to good to be true reviews , zombie diarys2 was a lot better filck , if you can find this cheaper and your a b-grade fan buy it but dont spend too much !!!!"
1,What was I thinking?,"Really, what was I thinking? This is my first review for Amazon, in an attempt to earn some karma points by saving someone else from wasting their time and money on this movie. I'm all for low budget movies, I've enjoyed some great ones multiple times. The Hidden, Bubba Ho-Tep, (or anything with Bruce Campbell, i.e. Army of Darkness,) Shaun of the Dead, all examples of what I think of as low budget great movies. I kept hoping this movie would pick up, improve, come around. Dud. I don't remember if I read the negative reviews, and then ignored them, probably. Please don't. Ken (Otis)"
3,nice soft towels,"They do tend to form little fuzz balls. I've only washed them a couple of times so perhaps that will change with a few more washings. They are soft and plush, my only dislike is that the design is only on one end of the towel instead of both so you must pay attention to that when hanging them up, which I do, but when your husband is in a hurry he often overlooks those small details ~ no biggie, just a nuisance. I would purchase them again. The color has not faded at all and I bought the dark brown ones."
5,Proof God uses man to reveal Himself,"As a dedicated Bible reader, I must say that Dr. Stauffer has helped raise the fog from my eyes. Any person that studies the Bible can tell you that if you apply every verse (by itself) to your life, you will be schizophrenic in a sense. I have discovered now, what parts of the Bible apply to me today. Dr. Stauffer does not reduce the importance of any verse of the Bible, but merely clarifies which of the gospels apply to modern man. I encourage any person to study this book. I would nearly say that if they did not realize what I have realized, I would give them a refund myself. God has clearly used Dr. Stauffer by blessing him with this knowledge."
1,Error,"Review by S. Bateman: I could not believe that this book had such a high rating on Amazon. I received this book as a young preacher at a youth meeting. It was a gift from a well-meaning pastor. During the following semester in college I noticed in our English class that a fellow student was doing his book report on this book. I told him I had the book, but had not read it yet, and asked his opinion. He replied that it is nothing but heresy. He was correct. Apparently Dr. Stauffer does not believe in salvation by grace for all. According to him, depending on the dispensation during which a person lives, he may have to work to keep his salvation, meaning that the sacrifice of Christ is not completely sufficient for some. Rubbish and fit only for the fire."
1,one book not-rightly divided,In my opinion author trys to bend dispensational bible study to fit his denominational viewpoints and is not a true representation of dispensationalism.
5,"Clear, helpful, advice...mother to mother","My family goes to Disney World every other years so we pretty much know the ropes....but I still buy the latest version of Wiley's guide before each visit. I find her hotel evaluation to be especially helpful, since we like to stay at a different Disney hotel each time we go. She lists pluses and minuses for each hotel, as well as information on how to get to the theme parks from each hotel. Many of the other guides make it seem like all the hotels are alike (or at least equally wonderful) but Wiley helps us sort it out."
5,Awesome,This was extremely helpful during my trip to Disney. I would recommend it to anyone traveling with children of all different ages.
2,"Nice idea, but don't stick well","Bought these quick corners hoping they would speed up prep-work, but they serisously don't stick well. Sure they're for ""delicate surfaces"", but even on flat painted walls/ceiling that should be easy to adhear to, these corner tabs kept falling off and paint would easily slip under the edges. Save the troule and money and just use masking tape in the corner."
4,Nice read,"For the fans of the long forgotten Western Story with its strong heroes and fast action this books is a collection of Elmore Leonard's best. Although concentrated in the Arizona/New Mexico region it has a nice variety of Indian, Calvary and Cowboy based stories with some of the wry twists that Mr. Leonard is so famous for in his novels. I would recommend this for some light reading for any Western fan."
2,Misleading advertising,"Unfortunately I purchased this the day before Christopher Beck posted his comment pointing out that although the name of the CD is ""The Complete Western Stories of Elmore Leonard,"" and the cover posted with it says ""unabridged,"" the CD is in fact only 2 of the 11 stories, or about one hour of reading. I was setting out on a 6-hour drive, and had to race back on-line and purchase a substitute by overnight, an expense I was not happy about. I just looked it up today, and it says that it is a ""CD [Abridged, Audiobook, Unabridged] [Audio CD]."" Good luck making sense out of that. Deconstructing it, it seems to make sense, but it certainly counts as misleading advertising at best. However, the two stories are great, and if the price for two short stories makes sense to you, then the purchase is good."
2,If you like Westerns than this book is for you.,I guess I am not a big Western fan.I read twelve of the short storties. Their endings left me wanting.
2,save your money,"FOR TWO STORIES, THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEYTHIS ONE SAYES ITS THE 11 STORY VERSION ISBN-10: 006074992XISBN-13: 978-0060749927CHECK IT OUTAT THE TOP OF PICTURE IS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE IT SAYS 11 STORIESWARNING : THIS HAS A BAD PRODUCT DESCRIPTION"
4,Complete Western Stories,I have not read this book yet but I am looking forward to doing so. Thanks for making book purchasing so easy.
5,Western Stories,"I like the Western stories of Elmore Leonard a lot, good descriptions, exciting and always a surspise ending, read the book twice which says a lot"
2,From the back cover,"Her dream husband.Ever since their passionate encounter, Somer's dreams had been filled with the lean, tanned body of Chase Lorimer. She hadn't been able to look at another man - even though she'd thought she'd never see Chase again.Now, Chase was back, and this time he wanted marriage - but on his terms. Somer had two choices: she could consent to be a convenient wife, or spend the rest of her life dreaming about him. Although the situation wasn't ideal, she knew she had to take a chance on the real thing..."
5,Important for the Arts of Evocation,"Much has already been said about this phenomenal collection of texts and I would be redundant to merely repeat much of what I find intriguing. However with that said, I have been delving into this phenomenal text since a fellow Evocational Magics practitioner turned me onto it. There's quite a bit of useful information for those who are practitioners of the arts of Summoning Spirits via Evocation.If you desire to use this collection of texts in this manner, then you will need to make a thorough study of the various texts in this collection. There are specific passages that work very well as incantations for summoning the 72 Spirits listed in the Goetia, the first book of the Lemegeton. Further the rite of the Headless One is included in this text without modification and that too is an excellent addition to the arsenal of the working karcist.Overall you will find a lot of useful lore and knowledge in this manual. Get it. Study it. Put it into use."
3,"Impressive, but...","While it no doubt took a lot of effort to create this book, some criticism is on order.Simple mistakes are made; for example, Sekhmet is confused with Bastet (""Cat godess, godess of war"").The demotic phonetic transliteration is simply awful.Often the greek alphabet is used to phonetically write egyptian or demotic words, but the lack of vowels is disregarded or willfully substituted.Words are joined at will, creating constructions such as ""NEPHRO-BANPRE"" - which the translator is then unable to interpret correctly.It's a good starting point, very informative and it's fun to translate those symbols and words the actual translators either couldn't or wouldn't offer an interpretation of, but it's by no means comprehensive."
3,This book could have been better...,"This book was so annoying..first off, I didn't really appreciate the author putting Liz and Todd back together for all of...two minutes!! Then..Just when you think Jessica can't act any more childish...she does just that by being so-called impulsive! Try repulsive! I don't know how a mature guy like Nick isn't bored with her antics by now...and Lila is a little nerve wracking in this book, too...Bruce should have pushed her into the pool!!I didn't really care for this book...I'm tired of Tom being so heartsick over Liz, too...geez..even Todd wasn't that heartsick..and he dated Liz for years!! Not months!!"
3,i think it is good in a way,"the reason why i rated this book as a 5, because i like Elizabeth more with Todd than Tom. I mean c'mon now do you think someone loves you and not try to clear and understand the situation first b4 judging you. I think that really hurts."
4,Great sander for what it is intended to do,"The sander functions well for what it is intended to do. I think it should come with the table extenders as without them, any larger work is difficult. These should not be an accessory sold seperately. Longer tables would be even better, perhaps as an accessory. I would add it. The paper is difficult to change."
3,Unboxed and already built,"I ordered this Bionicle as a collecter's item, only to find out that the Bionicle is already built and unboxed. The description said otherwise."
5,happy,"I received the pet sprayer and was happy with the product. Even though I probably will not use it as a pet sprayer, I really wanted it for washing my hair at the bathroom sink. It works very nicely for that purpose. Thank you for the product. I search quite a while before I found this."
2,Set up,"Product did not fit either my tub or sink faucet, to inexpensive to go through the hassle to return it"
1,sent it back,"Don't be fooled. This will not work with your bathtub unless your faucet is the same type as the one in your kitchen, if you have any type of bath-tub type faucet it will not fit. Ironically, I ended up finding a long hose with a kitchen sprayer type nozzle at a hardware store that is perfect, stays on the shower head all the time, is easy to shift back and forth and cost me about $7."
1,Rubber faucet connector comes off too easily,"This is not meant for regular sized faucets, typically found in most houses. The rubberized material used to connect the sprayer to faucet comes off too easily the moment you turn on the water flow. Dont waste time on this product."
2,Not the Rinse Ace 3 Way Pet Faucet Sprayer as Shown in Picture,"Purchased product from MB Worldwide LLC. Unfortunately, the item pictured and described did not match the item received. The picture and description of the item is the Rinse Ace 3 Way Pet Faucet Sprayer (as shown at Rinse Ace website). The item received was the Rinse Ace Indoor/Outdoor Pet Faucet Sprayer (which has a square sprayer head and no 3 way sprayer). Based on the information provided in the listing, I thought I was receiving the 3 way sprayer. Unfortunately, I had to return the item. Some sellers should be more accurate with their pictures and descriptions in order to avoid returns. With the exception of this item, my experience with Amazon purchases has always been a positive one."
5,Great Product,"No leaks, strong spray. I bought it to use when cleaning my garden tub, which gets little use but accumulates plenty of dust. Adapter attached easily to the faucet after removing aerator, and I just leave it on there. No adapter needed for my laundry tub, so it attaches to that faucet directly and I can use it to bathe my pup. This is well made, no leaks and easy to operate while holding on to a squirming pup. Spray is strong but fine, so it rinses Gus (and the tub) quickly and effectively."
1,Doesn't work unless you have a straight nozzle,Doesn't work unless you have a straight nozzle. I can't use it on any off the faucets in the house. I bought this so I could wash my dogs with warm water in the tub but the only nozzle it fits is outside where the cold water is and I could use a hose for that
5,So much easier!,"After looking locally for just such a product I found it on Amazon and was thrilled! This will make bathing our little dog so much easier! It fit our utility sink right out of the box (we had an attachment already added for another product). The button to release the water is complained about in other reviews but ours has a little metal clip that holds the button ""on"" while you bathe which can be released at any time. Indispensable if you have a dog to bathe! It beats using plastic cups to dump water over your dog. This will be so much faster."
4,Great addition to your utility sink and a cure for sore thumbs,"Like others have said, this is a great way to wash your small to medium sized dog. I would have given it 5-stars if it came with a way to keep the water lever depressed without straining my hand. As it is I came up with this solution. If you want to keep the handle depressed, try one of these:Velcro Reusable Self-Gripping Cable Ties, 0.5 Inches x 8 Inches Long, Black, 100 Ties per Pack (91140). They're remarkably handy and after you use one to solve this problem you'll have 99 left over to get your cables in order."
4,Almost a five star,"I needed a way to give my dog a bath using warm water during cold weather. My requirements were that I be able to use it while the dog was in the tub or shower stall. This product does all that, it is easy to set up and plus the hose is long enough to reach anywhere I need it. My dog does not love getting a bath but had no trouble adapting to the spray nozzel, it is gentle but can throughtly wet her during washing or rinsing. Why didn't I give it five stars? Because it did not include an adapter to connect it to the shower head, it would be simple to include a plastic adapter for the shower but the adapter for a sink is all that is included, which I never use."
5,Time Saver!,I know longer have to be an Octopus when I am washing my dogs! This is the best hose for me.It was not expensive compare to others out in the market that require and extra washer to modify a sink in the garage!
2,Not for everyone,"This book is on everyone's reading list for military professionals. However, most readers would not get much out of it. The author draws few lessons we can apply to a modern army and assumes a graduate level knowledge of history."
4,The Definitive Work on the Subject...but a bit dry,"The title of my review sums this book up pretty well. This book is amazingly well researched and sourced, but is a bit pedantic in its tone and style. This work may be a bit advanced or detailed for a casual military history reader but is a must for serious students of the subject."
5,LOVE IT,"Once had a sample tube of this product, however could not find the Whipped Silk in any of the stores even though other St. Ives products were available. Went Online and Walla there it was, happy day for me because I love the product and the price was right - I put this Web site in my ""Favorites"" and will order again. PTL for the Internet and Amazon."
4,Lost.....But Thankfully Found!,"Near the end of his life I had the opportunity to hear Stan Getz perform live at Carnegie Hall with a quartet that featured pianist Kenny Barron. Getz then (as he is also quoted in the liner notes of this CD) referred to Barron as ""the other half of my musical heart."" Quite a compliment indeed! Along with Chick Corea, who performed with Getz on the superb recordings ""Sweet Rain"" and ""Captain Marvel,"" Barron was a perfect match for the lyrical Getz. In addition to this session Getz and Barron recorded in a quartet setting at least three other times; these sessions are available on the CDs ""Anniversary,"" ""Serenity,"" and ""Soul Eyes."" I am glad to own all four. You will be too!"
5,Perfect little overnight carrying case for your PSP stuff.,"This case will not carry all of your PSP stuff if you have more than a few games/movies/peripherals. But its perfect for overnigt or buisness trips. With room for 6 discs, the PSP unit, some cords and a couple net pouches you should have room for enough PSP goodies to keep you happy for a day or two.Its small enough to fit easily into a backpack or duffle bag. The material surrounding the PSP nitch is stiff yet forgiving. It should help cushion against the inevitable drops and bangs.Over all this is just what I expected it to be and am very happy I bought it."
1,Horrible!! I wish there was a rating with no stars bc 1 is too many!!,"The item i purchased was a brand new item. The item i received in the mail was used, torn, and not even the right item!!! VERY HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!"
4,Decent for the price,"The case is decent for the price. I have had this case for a few years now and it is still holding up, barely but it's hanging in there. The felt within the entire case has all come unglued. But the psp and games still fit in the case nicely. I have taken this case to both Iraq and Afghanistan, so it has been through hell. I would buy this product again."
1,What the hell?,"First off, how the hell are you going to tell me that the computer comes with AMD Athlon and then tell me in the specs that the processor is Intel?Secondly, how the hell are you going to tell me that this computer comes pre-installed with Windows Vista and then tell me in the spec that the operating system of Windows XP Pro?The graphic card being 128MB already is a let down but this whole double spec monkey business is already iffy... Then again, I guess that's HP for you.Also running on DDR2... Guess this game is good if you're trying to play Runescape or Maplestory... Probably not even a good pick for casual uses."
5,Homage,"I don't yet have the single itself, but the song is great in my opinion. Just thought I'd mention that John Frusciante said himself (from the special edition Stadium Arcadium album DVD) that the main guitar riff is basically the main riff from Jimi Hendrix's 'Foxy Lady', just in a different key. And yes, I can see how it sounds similar to Tom Petty as well. But in the end, they're all excellent musicians who have obviously endured the test of time to be more popular and successful today than they were 15 years ago, after the release of their breakthrough 'Blood Sugar Sex Magic'. Only the best of the best bands in rock music (Tom Petty, for example) can reach out to as many people, if not more, almost a generation later. That said, can anyone really complain if one of their songs sounds kind of like another one?"
1,Oh Really?,"Yeah, good tune...Tom Petty thought so too when HE wrote 'Mary Janes Last Dance'....RED HOT RIPOFF! Go listen folks...same groove, same melody."
1,Thinly Veiled Porn,"If you are considering this movie for length or its apparent subject. Do not buy it, rather go listen to Felix Da Housecat and you will be better edified. It is and remains a veritable waste of anyone's time. Period"
3,Great Insider,"The account of Mr. Woodward (this time authorized!) regarding the quest for, and conquest of the White House by William Jefferson Clinton, made me realize very much about the man, and the politics that surround US Government. Though not usually my cup of tea (the book was a gift, I felt obligated!) it did reveal the machinations of the Federal Machine, and how you've got to do a little back rubbing for everyone to get anything done. That fact that Clinton and his team did so almost masterfully made the book worth reading right there. As with any President, or politician for that matter, Clinton did fall on his face a sufficient number of times, whether they were personal or political. His intelligence and charisma was artfully brought through by the author in a most skillful way. A must read for anyone trying to understand Clinton or his White House."
4,not what i expected,"liked this because it let me analyze the facts for myself, which was actually a lot more interesting than reading the book honestly. this actually makes a great reference item. the balance surprised me a little."
4,Not his best but still very good,"I own all of the books Bob Woodward has written and I am (slowly) working my way through them.The Agenda was released in 1994 during Bill Clinton's Presidency and provides us with a look at the run-in to him becoming President and throughout the first year or so of a tumultuous time for him.We get a close look at Clinton, his wife and his closest advisors. This is an intense book at times when we get the conflicts between members of Clinton's staff and their competing priorities as they try to push Clinton's ideas through Congress.I found this book to be a good read but I just found myself lacking the interest in parts of it that hasn't otherwise been the case with Woodward's earlier books.I think one of the major pluses with the author is that his books have an easy read appeal, he doesn't get bogged down in the intricacies of politics too often.All in all, this is worth a read but it is not his best work."
3,In-depth objective report of 1st term,"Woodward's book reads like an extended, objective newspaper report of Pres. Clinton's first term, especially the first budget cycle, and the tough economic/budget decisions he made. As we know now, Clinton's fiscal policies were much more ""conservative,"" than those of his successor. Clinton's budgets were by their very nature fiscally sound, with no deficit spending, and new programs, the few there were, fully funded within the budget. Woodward's book provides an account of how that conservative fiscal policy developed, and shines some light on how his devotion to fiscal soundness affected the health care initiative he campaigned for and later put Hillary Clinton in charge of. This is a straight reporting book, with little analysis."
2,"historical, but reads like throwaway journalism","For a book that will certainly serve as a primary source for presidential historians because of its insider reporting, this book is extremely disappointing and indeed superficial. You get a kind of blow by blow report of Clinton's tumultuous first year in the White House with virtually no analysis and context, but instead just raw description. I was appalled at how much trash was in it.The one nugget I took away was that in that first year, Clinton spent too much time chatting with aides due to his ""lack of discipline"" and enjoyment of exercising his mind with the extraordinary grasp he had of policy. But there is no exploration of his character, and indeed ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the details of the policies he was attempting to advance. As such, this book is like so much election journalism of today: covering the horse race but not the issues.Not recommended, except for academics doing deep research."
2,Sigh,"When is Bob Woodward gonna give it up? I wish he'd go sit on his Watergate laurels and not try to ""investigate"" every politician who comes down the pike. We're all sick of Clinton, let's just let it be and hope some good gets done."
5,Seiko watch,"MSN is on the ball! The watch is beautiful and arrived super fast. It doesn't get better than this! I would highly recommend buying from MSN, I know I will again.Joe M."
3,Did not live up to the cover blurbs....,"The book left a bit to be desired.. perhaps I am a softie, but I was really hoping for a better ending. Maybe something along the lines of ""Wild Country""'s. Hopefully tho, Ing brings the main character back for a sequel. Missed the Post Script that he usually puts in too, that ""rising crane shot at the close with the fade to black and the rolling of credits"" that lets you see where things end up. (of course, I always wanted him to bring Baal back as well, but that is an 'odds so slim, they're anorexic' hope)"
2,disappointing,"Like Soft Targets, this novel has some interesting ideas, but fails to provide an adequate framework in which to place them. The pair of killers are just too unconvincing, with personal details that seem included more for their novelty than as a natural outgrowth of their personalities (and this includes a truly repulsive sex act early in the novel). I can't say how it ended because I didn't get that far."
1,bad birthday gift,"We have bought the toy at Toys-R-Us local store as a birthday gift. Imagine kid's disappointment when it turned out that the remotes/motors don't work. Exchanged the toy same day. Both remotes and motors seemed to work fine. Next day one crab's left motor got weak and inadequate to the right one. Most likely we will return the toy and buy something else. LEGO, don't save on QA."
3,Dayne's recemendation of the Manas,The manas is ok to play with but it totaly drains the batteries if u leave them in the motor it doesen't have much power and is also very slow but is extreamly good for educational benifits.
2,Not impressed,"I just know with the talent out there, this could of been done a whole lot better. I just think they dipped into too many things that will plant the wrong seeds in the minds of youth."
3,pretty good,"this book was pretty good, but on the second read, it did seem rather cliche in parts. maybe trenka could take her book to another level."
1,Not for me,"Five beginnings in two pages - she lost me. Too bad because the opening was terrific - a letter in broken English about the dysfunction that led to the adoptions in the first place. She changed voices, times, places; should have stuck with letter and taken it from there."
1,Disappointing!!!!!!!!!!!,"'In Tue Stereo' should have been the first clue that something is missing besides the letter 'R'.Do NOT be misled by this title. All the music comes from the film 'Sun Valley Serenade' all of which has been previously released. Of the 18 tracks only 4 are in stereo and only two of those feature the Glenn Miller band. The other two are studio orchestras on 'The Kiss Polka' and the 'Finale medley'.I was expecting more than a rehash of previously released material, all of which I have on other Glenn Miller releases.One of the tracks sounds like some sort of radio promotion that features edited versions of all the songs from Sun Valley Serenade of which the full versions are on the other tracks!. 3 tracks are from radio broadcasts which, again, are available on other releases."
5,"A Classic: Recommended For New Players And ""Casual"" Players","Although an older book's claim to being ""Modern"" can be disputed, Modern Chess Strategy remains current because of its emphasis on ideas and principles. Using lucid prose and numerous diagrams, Lasker - a strong international master-level player in his day - teaches the newcomer the basic principles of opening development, combinations, and endgame principles. What I particularly like is the author's no nonsense approach: he doesn't dumb down nor does he attempt to overwhelm with variations. One shouldn't be put off by the book's age (I think it was written in the 1920s): You're getting first-rate, world-class instruction for a bargain-basement price."
5,Ageless Classic,"An excellent book on chess strategy. Lasker does a great job in explaining game principles through very entertaining master games. Besides being an excellent technical resource, it makes for a good read.There's only a very small drawback, and that is the old-style annotation of games. There really should be an algebraic edition for this excellent treatise.A must-have for any serious chess fan."
4,Very pleased,"After reading several magazine reviews for this product I decided to give it a try, all my other favorite products have been discontinued. Although the cost is higher than what you would pay at the local drug store I think it is definately worth it. No bleed all day!!! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I was hoping it would make my lashes REALLY long, and it just does long. I do love it enough to keep buying it, no more messing around with drug store or counter brands."
3,"Meh, not worth the price.","This mascara is OKAY. It certainly did not blow my mind. It's nicer than most that I've tried, but if you want lashes with impact for half the price, I suggest Voluminous by L'Oreal. The Diorshow seemed to take a lot more coats to get my lashes looking big and I noticed that it did flake off onto my cheeks throughout the day. It didn't get clumpy which is quite nice. After reading all the reviews, I was expecting to try it and say ""wow! I'll never go back to drugstore mascara."" But that's not the case. Glad I tried it, and it wasn't worthless, just not as good as Voluminous and terribly over-hyped."
2,So disappointed!! forgetaboutit!!,"I had bought this Dior mascara thinking it would be as good as the first time I bought it a few years ago when shopping at Sephora cosmetics in the city. Wow, was I in for a disappointment! Originally it had given me full and long lashes with just a few applications. The best I ever used. That was over 5 years ago. I guess the quality has changed radically. I was so happy when it arrived but when I opened it up and began to use it I noticed right away that it seemed dried out and difficult to get any real mascara on my lashes. It took many, many applications just to get any noticable change. I bought a $7 dollar mascara at my local market chain that works 100% better then this $28.dollar junk. What a peice of......well, you know. Forgetaboutit! Keep your cheaper brand and don't buy this. I can't belive I threw away this much money on this stuff."
3,Good but I still love Chanel,"Tried to find something that was less expensive than Chanel and this is a pretty good mascara, but I just think that it is not worth the extra money over LOREAL!!!! Whom, by the way I think is owned by Lancome. Sticking to Chanel, just cannot beat... That is when I can afford it LOL"
3,Not crazy about it,"I am not sure if this Mascara is supposed to be that dry or it is because it was bought through website. Anyway, I don't like it -it feels very dry..like I was already using it for few months. I will definitely check it out in the store, but wouldn't buy though website again for sure."
2,Disappointed,"This started out fantastic, and it was particularly good as separating lashes. Unfortunately, it very shortly started drying and clumping. Within a couple months, I could no longer use it and it was tossed out.I am very careful with my makeup -- especially my expensive makeup -- and this was always tightly sealed and used only a few times a week. It was never pumped.At this price, mascara should last much longer and behave much better. I am very disappointed. I doubt I'll buy another Dior product ever again."
3,Okay product not outstanding as I expected,For the money Estee Lauder's More Than Mascara wins hands down. I will not purchase again.
4,Dior Show Mascara,"It is one of the better mascaras on the market. When you curl your eyelashes, and brush this on, it enhances your lashes while keeping the curl."
2,Overrated,"Always on the prowl for the best mascara (my biggest concerns being the brush and whether or not it will leave those faint grey smudges under my eyes from flaking), I read that Allure recommended this one 3 years in a row as the Best Mascara. I will admit that I love the brush and the way it goes on. But, from day one, it flakes and I get smudges under my eyes. I was told by a Mac representative that that means the mascara is old and needs to be replaced. That was true for my last mascara (Mac), but either I purchased old Dior mascara, or Dior is just overrated (and probably pays Allure for that #1 spot). So, I guess I'm out $24, and will go back to the Mac counter and buy there. When you find something good, stick with it! Also, I wasn't expecting the mascara to smell so perfumy! Ugh. I hate perfumes."
3,It was ok but not worth the price,I would recommend Cover Girl's Lash blash over this product. You get the same result for half of the price. It is not worth the price especially because a less expensive product provides the same result.
3,In the Beginning - AWESOME - but quickly dries out,"Ok - this is a great mascara - not clumpy, not gooey, volumizing, no flaking - FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS :( And then it dries out and you feel like there is no product left or you just can't get enough on your lashes. For the amount of money - I would hope that it would last a little longer. It definately is a great mascara - but does not last or preserve well at all. The best mascara - and I love makeup and try a bunch - is Max Factor 2000 plus. Plus, about 1/3 of the cost and lasts much longer."
2,Dior Mascara,I hadn't seen this mascara before I bought it online and I have to say I'm petite and the wand is gigantic! I feel like when I'm putting it on its like a huge bumble bee with out the buzzing. It applies okay overall nothing overly impressive. I think I'll stick to my Lancome Definicils.
1,"FAKE PRODUCTS BE AWARE! DIOR MASCARA WAS FAKE, FULL REFUND GIVEN","THE DIORSHOW MASCARA I PURCHASED WAS FAKE, I EMAILED THEM AND WAS REFUNDED WITHIN HOURS, DONT BUY FROM THESE GUYS!"
4,Consistent with other reviews,"Dramatic, doesn't clump, goes on very nicely, no smudging. Has a chemical smell, but it goes away after it dries. It's the best mascara I've ever used, including department store brands. The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is price, but I haven't yet seen how long it will last. Worth it if money is no object. I will continue to buy it."
3,It's okay.,"I am a mascara FREAK, so I just had to try Diorshow after all the hype it's been getting. It is a pretty good mascara, and the floral scent is nice, but it's really not that amazing. I think my good old Maybelline Full N Soft does the best job of any mascara out there. Diorshow is fun to try once, but I'm not dropping $23 everytime I need new mascara."
3,Not impressed,"I tried DiorShow Blackout first and fell in love. I wanted to try Diorshow however because I'd heard so many good things about it and thought it might be worth it. I have to say I'm very disappointed - I mean, it's still good - still Dior, but I think Blackout gave me much more longer and thicker lashes and never smudged. Diorshow however always runs when I cry which is so unbecoming! If you are stuck between Blackout and Diorshow, I'd say go with Blackout."
2,Not good,"Sephora suggested this product and by the reviews of the public on various websites, I plunked down the 20 or 30 something for it. First off, the brush is way too big. If you are petite like I am and have small eyes/eyelash space you will end up making a huge mess with the brush. I am a big fan of Christian Dior (don't get me wrong, they make the best eyeshadow) but this mascara just wasn't for me. I have had better luck with the Loreal ""ball"" mascara (black and red tube). I won't be buying it again. You can save your money and get something a lot better."
2,"Overall, Pretty Disappointing","I bought this and had to return it. It gives length, but not much volume.It's clumpy and hard to remove -- you might accidently remove some lashes and then you'll REALLY need volumizing mascaraDoesn't live up to the hype and is definitely overpriced"
3,Review on Dior diorShow Black Mascara 090,I was really disappointed in this product but it was not the fault of Amazon. Amazon gave me excellent service. I had seen an advertisement in a magazine & was impressed with the volume that it claimed to give the customer - the photos looked amazing! When I used the product it did not give me the volume I was looking for. Perhaps other customers had better luck with the product.
4,expensive but worth it.,"This mascara is excellent. It has a nice brush that coats my lashes evenly and gives it a nice dark look. I have average lashes, not too long or full, so I just need a little something to make them really pop. I read reviews where clumping was a problem and would just suggest having an old cleaned mascara wand or spoolie (target) to go over the lashes real quick after application and it takes care of the problem. also, this mascara is good for use night and with darker shadows/liners where lashes might be less noticeable. -minimal flaking."
5,1970 Mustang Boss 429 3 n'1 by Revell,I am 13 years old and this was my first model. I made it the street version with the stock rims and painted the exterior Purple-Lucious and the interior semi-gloss black. I have made many and this one still remains my favorite. Any 3 n'1 model is great. You should deffinitley get this if you are pondering about it.
4,Two Awesome Songs and One Not-Quite Awesome Song,"The version of Mystical Machine Gun on this release is the one from the video (which I like a trifle more than the album version), not the one from PP&A.;Avalonia is a soft acoustic ramble that never quite takes off and while I like the mellow offerings as much as the next fan, this one did not go beyond the ""Eh, it's alright."" phase.Holy River could have easily fit into the track listing for PP&A; as one of the heavier, lush creations that were the hallmark of Kula Shaker's second full length release. The two better songs bookend the slower more quiet song in the middle. Is it worth the money for a different version of an existing song, a so-so acoustic softy and a full-bodied psychadellic rocker? It was for me."
1,18 dollar rip-off,"I had no idea this dvd was just 11 minutes. What a rip-off.What they had to say could have been said in 11 seconds.Shame, shame, sham!"
5,Great replacement!,My husband lost his original book to a bad case of mold so I sent for this to replace his book. The book was not brand new but still in excellent condition. He thought that was a thoughtful Christmas gift! Great purchase!
1,A horrible book!,"Think of as many of the terrible things that people (particularly men) can do to other people (particularly women), cram them into one book, and you've got Abuse of Power. I finished it only because I hoped the ending might somehow justify the suffering of the main character, but it just kept getting worse. Well, at least there won't be a sequel."
2,Made for TV Book,"Once again, I am misled by the cover jacket. This seemed like a long painful public service announcement against rape with a little corruption thrown in. The easy way to get rid of the baddies is to have them fired. The skies open up and all is well with the world again. Even the teenage daughter didn't have to ""put out"" to save the day.I could normally deal with such a contrived ending, but it seemed to be there almost to balance the unbelievable luck of not having to actually INVESTIGATE to find the killer. I just hope they don't cast Suzanne Sommers when it goes direct to video."
3,Readable but disappointing,"As I started this book, I got a quick idea where the heroine stood with her background and current state of mind. That should have been the warning. I liked a lot of the plot lines and the character descriptions were adequate. But most of the characters were either not as sympathetic as they should have been or as evil as the author would have us accept. Grant was mean and cruel, but I never felt the outrage I should have. Rachel seemed at the end to have a life as uncharmed as life can be. Nothing ever went well and as she learned something new or accepted some part of her past, closure was just a word. Cliches not withstanding, the story followed a predictable path. I never believed for a moment that Tracy was in trouble or that Carrie would move away from a good position to take up residence in her sister's home. And what was all that with Mike? First one sister then the other. Please. It kept me reading, only if to find out something I didn't expect."
3,"Enjoyed Book, Until The Ending","Rachel's life was a continual tragedy. A reader can buy into her fight to keep her ethics intact while working in cop's and lawyer's (political) corrupt world dominated by men. The book had me hooked, but I hated the ending. I just couldn't believe she would readily accept her old job back after all the stuff she had to put up with by the police brass, etc. (posing for a picture with the police chief who was one of the bad guys in her career as a police officer). The ""real"" Rachel would have told him to take his job reinstatement offer, and shove it! I also couldn't buy into her sister and daughter's ""happy-ness"" meter after a six month period of mourning. Her sister becoming Rachel at the end was too much to swallow, as was Rachel walking off with her husband from the wedding chapel."
3,Well....,"It was a page turner, BUT I felt unsatisfied when I finished the book. There was something missing. I don't know what exactly, but I'm not sure I want to read another book from this author. It was the first one I read from Rosenberg. The characters were not developed enough. I didn't really like the ending because I was expecting something much more different, so I was disappointed."
3,"Lovely photos, but where's the instruction?","I recently purchased this book. While the photos and the choices of styles shown are lovely, I find there are little to no instructions on how to acheive these looks. It does not have things that would be helpful to the nouveau stylist such as step by step diagrams or styles-in-progress photography available for you to be able to check your work as you go. Adding these things as an appendix, even, would have been most helpful. Thank you, Robin Rogers-Kostel Hesperia, CA"
3,Informative and useful,"I found the information contained in this book to be useful. I come from a large family and I cut everybody's hair. This book explains how to cut short, long, and curly hair. It also shows you how to cut in layers(which is a very popular style) and how to style hair with barrettes, clips bows and clips. It really goes in depth on braids twists knots and the use of gels and mousse. It comes complete with illustrations and I found it very useful because I'm a begiiner."
3,In the mane it is ok...,"This book has plenty of pictures and quite a variety of styles for short, medium and long hair. However, the descriptions on how to achieve the look are cryptic and one must learn basically through trial and error."
2,"Blowdry-spray, curl-spray, comb-spray, ad infinitum","Most styles depend on spray, gel, mousse or wax. Next to nothing on braids, twists, and updos and what there is is very basic with minimal instruction. After the section on care of your hair--minimize contact with direct heat, don't weigh hair down--there follows a collection of styles requiring blowdrying, curling irons, or hot curlers and the aforementioned goop. The section on ""Super Cuts"" which allow a number of different styles from one haircut was intriguing, but I don't believe I could repeat most and have them last five minutes after getting out the front door. Lots of lovely pictures of studio styling, but usually showing just one angle per style."
1,Shipping,"I ordered this book on Feb 10th, today is March 01st and the book didn't arrive yet. I sent several email but no answer. Its a bud deal this store.Marco Kakehashi"
3,Lots of nice hairstyles- but I need more instruction!,"I am by no means a hair stylist- I need a little more help with achieving these styles. It would help greatly to know how to cut the hair to get that great look! Someone else might be able to give it one look and know just how to cut the hair. We beginners need a little more help. A good book though for ideas, and maybe you could take it to your hair stylist who could cut your hair the way it looks in the picture."
5,"This is a Picture Book, but they are good pictures",I can understand that people would be upset that this book does not have instructions for the styles. The editorial review does lead people to believe that this book explains things. It really doesn't explain anything. Then again most magazines don't explain styles either. This book is meant for choosing a style. If you are using this book for that purpose then its a great book. This would be a great book for salons to have in their lobby.
4,Pretty Good Book!,"I generally enjoyed this book, and I do think that it is a good reference for people looking to change the way their hair is styled. However...Note to Potentially Dissatisfied Customers:This book is NOT a book that tells you how to braid your hair or put it up. It is a book that gives you ideas on ways to cut your hair or restyle it at the length that it already is. If you are looking to find ways of putting your hair up, I recommend ""Hair"" by Anne Akers Johnson instead of this book."
4,Nice Book,"This book is pretty good, but it's not one of those books that have hairstyles like braids and buns. The book starts off with some basic haircuts for all lengths of hair, then it goes on to give many hairstyles that can be acheived with one of the basic cuts. This book includes hairstyles for short, medium, and long hair, and has hairstlyes for all types of hair. This book also features tips about caring for your hair and what to do if you have problems like oily hair or split ends. My only complaint is that the book lacks instruction. There is some instruction, but not much. However, this is a great book, and wonderful for anyone who wants to do something new with their hair."
2,Surely not the best!,"The book description for this book makes it sound like it has instructions for styles for all types of hair. And it does, except I thought ""styles"" meant things like buns, braids and updos. The ""styles"" in this book are things like, ""Blow-dry the hair, than use styling gel to hold it in place."" Not very informative! This book has a nice layout, for short-medium-long hair, with a curly hair section at the end of each length of hair section. Overall, if you are into blow-drying your hair instead of braiding it or something of that sort, than it is a pretty good book."
3,Very 'eighties'!,"This book gives lots of styling ideas but be aware that many of the styles (and photographs)are definitely dated and hark back to the eighties! That said, the best part of this book is that it gives the sense that one hairstyle can still provide many possibilities for having different looks for different occasions."
2,Be careful using this if you have wireless networking,"This camera system works great on its own, unfortunately, it operates at 2.41 - 2.47 GHz and interferes with my 2.4 GHz Linksys wireless-G network router at home. Thus, I can either choose to have wireless computer network connectivity OR to use this camera system."
1,Pure Crap,"This is one of the worst things I've read in a long, long time. The characters are one dimensional (if that), the plot contrived, the writing style amateurish (Whitcomb's idea of describing a person, for example, is to simply 'name drop' a string of designer labels - and he does this over and over).The conclusion, which because the book ended is what I must call it, felt like the end of a really bad comic book, and does nothing more than set the stage for what I must suppose is a whole series of 'superhero spy' books.I'll pass, thanks. Fool me once ..."
3,Black,"Technology is a double edged sword; whatever has the potential for great good can destroy just as thoroughly. Such is the case in Black, a thriller that takes readers into the world within the world where only one man knows everything that is going on; that man is Jordan Mitchell, who holds the key to totally safe communication. On the surface that seems good, but in the hands of killers, it's deadly. The trio of his costars must navigate his traps within traps to save not only their lives, but perhaps the world.*** For fans of Robert Ludlum or Tom Clancy, this will be a thrill ride they could easily get hooked on. Multi layed stories parallel each other until they intertwine to bring the journey to an end. Like an Escher painting, you will find nothing is as it seems. ***Amanda Killgore"
1,painful to finish,"I finished the book, but it was a struggle. I agree with other reviewers that the ending was a stretch. The constant juggling of viewpoints and storylines from character to character has been done by others, and for them, it worked. Here, it was annoying and distacting. Do not waste your money or your time on this book."
5,A Very timely Novel,I bought this book because I had read Cold Zero and after watching Christopher Whitcomb on CNBC's nightly program Checkpoint for a year I really listened to what he had to say. The characters all have there own adgenda and everything comes together at the end. This book gives insight to how our country really works and a lot of information about terrorists and how they work. Very timely in the world we live in. It is great to read a book that you do not want to put down. I did for a day since I did not want it to end. Can't wait until New White hits the bookstores.
3,Lots of Action,I have have found it a rare thing to find an author who writes good action scenes and also develops a believable plot and characters. This author offers action. As others have noted the Deus Ex Machina ending seems to have been driven by the author's desire to stop writing.
4,Black Spells Adventure!,"There is a new talent out there - and his name is Christopher Whitcomb.This novel, a first of a series, is a fun and adrenaline fueled action/adventure filled with covert ops and intriguing characters. I look forward to his newest and latest follow-up novel."
1,Decidedly disappointing,A tiresome read and one in desperate need of an editor. The ending is absurd and the characters as flat at the dialogue. Definitely not recommended.
2,Black and Blue,"For a guy who is a special op's expert this book falls far short of expectations. It also has several glaring inconsistencies. A woman leaves her lovers apartment with only cash and no purse and then goes to the bad guys office, copies a disk and then puts it into her, well, purse. Where did she get the disk to copy on or the purse to put it in? Well we just don't know.This book is full of stuff like that. Save your money and buy Flashman instead."
3,Neconservative fantasy never comes together,"I kept reading because the details felt authentic and I wondered how the many themes would all come together. Well, they don't. Even if one embraces the neoconservative Ayn Rand fantasy that underlies the plot--it is better to hand over control of our destiny to a few well-meaning rich individuals than to stumble along with a democracy--never mind that absolute power corrupts absolutely--one is still left with such details as to why the ""good guys"" tortured the good-looking broad when they knew she was a double agent for their own side and why they had a hired assassin work over a middle-aged lady while she was in the nude instead of framing her a million other obvious ways. No I won't be reading his other books."
3,A quick summer read,"Three and a half stars, really, because his insider's view of the mindset of his military and FBI characters, especially in the context of current events, raises this book above the level of pure cotton candy potboiler.He gives decent dialogue and motivation to characters he's obviously at home with, but his other characters come out flat. And he drops so many names of high-priced luxury items worn or admired by his non-FBI-related characters that it looks like that's how he's tried to develop their characters.I guess it's the nature of the beast that the author sacrifices character development for the sake of the plot.A good beach or hammock read."
4,A good read with the strong scent of authenticity.,"I loved Whitcomb's biography, ""Cold Zero"" but was skeptical that his entry into fiction would take a predictable route: too much emphasis on tradecraft and hardware and little attempt to tell a good story. Surprisingly, the book kept me engrossed. Like other reviewers, I felt the characters were one-dimensional and I had trouble figuring out where the various plots were going to end up as I got nearer and nearer to the endng. But the book all came together in a surprise ending which was a bit much -- at least that's what I thought at the time. But the more I think about it, it was devilishly clever. I'm glad I read the book. I'll read his next offering with no small amount of anticipation."
2,Disappointment,"At some point you realize that all the threads of the story will never be tied up as the books remaining pages disappear. Then when the end arrives, so does anger. I can accept that this is the first of, how many? But the complex absurdity of the ending is insulting in this world, where a fanatic with a backpack cannot be stopped."
4,Very good summer read,"Of the three novels I've recently read (Da Vinci, Bark of of the Dogwood, and Black) this one is by far the best. Like another reviewer, I too caught a few errors in the novel (the Lincoln Center vs Kennedy Center), but not enough to be put off. The most disturbing aspect of this work of ""fiction"" is its sense of reality. We all know the results of ""politics"" and non-information-sharing organizations, but the setting that Whitcomb provides us, along with his observations, are more than a little unsettling."
2,What the?,"Major disappointment. Despite all the potential, the book finishes all the open questions in the final two pages - unrealistic and unimaginative. Even the high points of the book lacked detail and interest."
2,The ends don't determine the means,"This novel has the advantage of being written by an expert in FBI ops. The characterization of the training and life as an agent was interesting. But the whole plot revolved around the ""mastermind"" predicting each and every step of his operatives, including how they would respond to torture, and at what exact moment they would end up in his office suite. And to what end? Probably one of the most ridiculous conclusions you'll read in a long time."
1,Awful,"Aside from the outlandish plot of 462 pages that all gets resolved in the following two pages, Whitcomb really isn't that good of a writer. That's where the book falls off. I ended up skipping large chunks of meaningless paragraphs as he explained, in minutia at times, what exactly was on a persons desk.Thrilling, I know.Please don't buy this. I honestly feel I wasted money on the paperback, and it is difficult to ever feel $8 is wasted."
1,Far below standard,"Cold Zero, Whitcombs autobiography showed signs of real writing talent. ""Black"" shows none of that talent. The characters are one dimensional and un-interesting. The plot is hopelessly confused. At just 360 pages, is a short book, but he seems to have had to work hard to stretch it that far. If it had been published as a short story it might have been better. As it is, it lacks reality, creativity and gravitas. Unlike Whitcomb, Andy Mcnabb was a REAL soldier in the war on terror, and knows how to write a taught, interesting book."
3,Pleasant entertainment,"Nothing will replace CW's, Cold Zero. Still, in Black, there's enough of the author's personality and material inspired by his 'war stories' weaved into the plot to keep most readers very pleased."
3,A bit too technical - rather boring,"We had the privilege of meeting Christopher Whitcomb at Sleuthfest MWriters in Ft. Lauderdale, FL one year where our daughter was in charge of programs. We thoroughly enjoyed his personality, information about being under cover, etc.Loved Cold Zero. We were enchanted with the way he told a story. Obviously, Black was an earlier story and he had to losen up for those not in the 'business'.Bev & Ken Cook"
2,Over the top...not as great as the first,"The third and final installment of the stonekeeper's adventures. I must say that this story was not as great as the very first installment ""The Passion Ruby"" where Hawk and Sienna first met. There was much more suspense, action, sensuality, and romance in ""The Passion Ruby"" where as in this one, Hawk seems to have evolved into a madman. Though, now I understand the true extent of his visions this took away some of the romance. I found it ridiculously funny and overly exaggerated when Hawk literally went ""crazy"" due to his visions and jumps over a table running off and yelling as if he were some wild animal. I could not contain my laughter.Don't get me wrong Ms Snoe is a great writer; ""the ties that bind"" is an excellent example. This one however, is much too over the top and unrealistic."
3,Pleasant but not much science,Pleasant but less science than most programs in the Nature series. But fun for those of us who love dogs and cats.
4,loved it,i saw this program on PBS last night and I fell in love! a must have for those who share a life and love their pet!
3,Morganite,I found the book in the library. I glanced at a few pages and found myself checking it out. I'm not really into these kinds of novels but he comes from my alma mater Morgan st. So I supported the brother. I'm proud to see a fellow alum doing something positive. The book is good.
2,"Disapointing game, despite the name","This game is highly billed for it's obvious shortfalls:(1) poor graphics: I've seen better graphics from PSX games, there seems to be no difference between regular RCA output and the SVHS output; the polygons are huge and the color seems flat(2) poor gameplay: while the driving simulation may be accurate in terms of the physics of driving, the gameplay is inadequate. The driving is extremlely twitchy and just plain not fun. There are too few cars and tracks to drive.Although it's not a rally game, Gran Tourismo 3 is a far better racing game all around. World Rally Championship 3 is a better game, despite being much older.Honestly, the best thing about this game is the menu music. What does that say?"
2,Disappointing after the brilliant CMR 2.0,"Codemasters really dropped the ball on this one, making for a ridiculous championship mode in which you can ONLY be Colin McRae, and in which you can ONLY drive one car. They've also removed all the other options from CMR2.0, such as being able to run full rallies in other types of cars, etc. In CMR3, you can only run stages. If you want to run a full rally, you'll have to do the championship mode, which ends after three seasons.Ridiculous."
3,ok rally game,"This game is ok at best, its not as good as I thought it would be, The presentation of the game is lacking when compaired to world rally championship, a much better game if I might add. The graphics are not as good as the back of the box claims although the car models are quite pleasing to look at, the damage on them is realistic. So if you want a good rally game I recomend world rally championship for purchase and I recomend colin mcrae for rental at best."
5,"I wanna dude 2 mek me ""breathe E-Z"" wooooooooo","Well, first of all I would like to say BEENIE you did it again. You have managed to give the ladies what they want (as always).I love the way the words to the song and the beat were eclected. Like I said once again he pulled it off again."
4,Birds of Minnesota CD,I gave this item as a gift. She absolutely loved it. It is nice to find a CD of bird calls so one can know the sight as well as the sound of different birds.
4,4 stars...considering I'm not a racing gamer,"Now Usually I don't like racing games unless its a good classic such as Mario Kart 64 or something. But usually I dislike racing games. On this however you can customize/invent your own car and more. The gameplay/racing is'nt too bad itself. There is a big selection of nice/good cars such as Mercedes CLK's, Toyota Super's, and much more. IF you're a racing gamer this game is worth buying, IF you're like me rent it first or play the demo before you think about buying it."
2,Terrible,"I enjoy many racing games . . . GT3, Burnout, Rallisport . . . but this one is horrible. Handling is fine, graphics are beautiful, replay fun, but everything else doesn't live up to the hype. Sound: you cannot hear the cars, the cheering washes out the cars and no way to adjust what sound is at what level. Tracks: are odd and irregular. And AI seem to cheat a bit . . . but that is in every game to a degree."
4,A Great overall game,"Another great Atari game. In this game you not only race but you manage your own dealership and build cars from old blueprints of concept cars that you found in an old gas station. Although the driving is not as realistic as it could be, It is really fun to try to get your dealership up and running. You have to compete in multiple race circuits and by winning them you sell more cars and get more money. You also get to customize the Name of your company and pick the logo. A game thats actually worth the retail."
4,"zoom,zoom, zoom","Ok, this game is coming out this feb. (as i was told). But i have played the demo from xbm (XBox magizine). There are about 80 licsended cars including most japan makers, mazda, nissan, honda. and some american ones too. Basicaly it's your average racing game, but there is a catch. you can design and build your own car, make the brand name different but not the car name, so i could change chevrolet into daddydoo, but if the car was a neon it would stay a Neon.overall it's a very good racing sim. with a big choice of cars and tracks.But i gave it 4 stars because it's not XBox Live enabled.rent first, then buy if u enjoyed it.note:this game is for mostly racing fans only."
3,Avoid -- wonky AI,Nice graphics and lots of tracks but there are some serious problems in the opponent AI. The other cars will constantly bump you to slow you down. And yes really all of the time they will do this and to the end of the game. If you try to bump them however they don't move in inch. This makes no sense. It is a shame because your car will steer fine (in an arcade sort of way) and the sense of speed is pretty good. But the annoying AI of the other cars will probably drive you nuts.
5,One of the great names of european fantasy & the absurd,"For everyone interested in fantasy in its purest state this is a gemm. This anthology mixes the many themes that cross the polish author's short stories. The pure horror, the ghost story, the surrealist (before its time), really erotic images, all of this with just enough hints of a certain modernism or post-modern that rends the stories an extra quality.It's a must and will certainly fill a gap on fantasy literature.The train stories are just amazing - This guy wrote one collection of stories just around trains he worked with the modern concept of speed as a moto for the future society which would be obliterated by it... I wonder if he didn't just get it right..."
4,good book,"after some stupid stunts at sweet valley middle school for initiation of choosing a new president for the unicorns, the unicorns get in trouble and have to do community service hours. But this was something that would change them all for the better, at least in the first 5 books of the series that is. They became softies who wanted to help children and elizabeth and maria joined the unicorns."
3,6 made-for-TV Sci-Fi movies on DVD for the first time,"Here's the contents, the year they were produced, plus overall score from IMDB:The Android Affair (1995) - 5.1/10It Came from Outer Space II (1996) - 3.8/10Deep Red (1994) - 4.7/10Evolution's Child (1999) - 4.9/10Night Visitors (1996) - 4.1/10Control Factor (2003) - 4.7/10Also, three of the movies now carry ratings:The Android Affair [PG-13 - Some sensuality and violence]It Came From Outer Space II [PG-13 - Sci-Fi violence]Deep Red [R - Violence]"
2,DO NOT BUY,"IT IS PACKAGED TERRIBLY! Almost all the disks were ruined when I got them. I have never seen a dvd set packaged so bad! All the disks are packed so tight and two of them didn`t even have a place to put them like a typical case would have, they were just loose in the package!"
3,Caveat emptor!,"This is a pricey dvd set, but the '87 Canada Cup is the gold standard for hockey fans--the most competitive and thrilling contest ever staged in the Canada Cup series. Gretzky and Lemieux in their prime, supported by Coffey, Bourque, Messier and a dozen other Canadian stars faced arguably the greatest Soviet side ever. There's no questioning the value of the series, and of the dvd set--if it were properly produced. My set, however, contains a third disc that is so glitchy that the crucial third periods of both the semifinal game between Canada and the Czechs, and the final round robin game with the Soviets are unwatchable. I haven't yet tried to watch the 3-game final (each game on its own disc), and I hope those discs are sound. But already I'm feeling cheated with the product, given that faulty third disc."
2,Angry and Biased,"Chang does nothing but rave angrily, sometimes supplementing her rage with biased studies and liberal ""logic."" She finds fault in the United States in every way possible and holds no one else accountable for the situation immigrant women are in.The book is poorly written and is hardly debatable as the amount of left-wing propoganda is insurmountable."
5,Great book about Franz A. Bischoff,"Jean Stern did a superb job documenting the history of this important California artist. As one of America's foremost buyers of Franz Bischoff paintings, I highly recommend this book. www.LawrenceBeebe.com"
5,Challenging Ride,"The only other game you could compare this with is Microsoft's RalliSport Challenge. RalliSport Challenge graphics are brighter and the feel of the joystick is better, but you do not get penalized for flooring it throughtout the race. Finesse is rewarded in Infogrames Colin McRae Rally 3 after playing both, Colin McRae Rally 3 is more realistic. The damage on the car does affect your performance, the dust and the rain does affect your vision, and the tracks are more competitive. If your lookng for realism choose Colin McRae Rally 3, if you just want fun with your young ones, choose Microsoft RalliSport Challenge."
3,colin mcrae rally 3,This game is just like the ps2 version.Where is the use of the extra xbox power?
2,Where's The Passion?,"If you take away the heavy production on this recording, you're left with mediocre melodies and chord patterns...Try ""Heat Of The Sun"" by Strunz and Farah, or ""Guitarra Del Fuego"" by Johannes Linstead for music that will pass the ""one week test"". If you don't mind vocals, try Gipsy Kings ""Somos Gitanos"". Man, they still write amazing music."
5,Great Sounds,Free Fall is a very well put together album. We liked the violin and the drums with the guitar. We can play it over and over and never get tried of it. It is magical!!
3,Totally Not Flamenco,I'm not sure what type of music this was supposed to be but it's not like anything I've ever heard from Jesse Cook in the past. Most of the songs sound like something you'd expect to hear in a tavern in India. I was totally disappointed. I'll think twice before I buy another CD by Jesse Cook.
2,What a disappointment,"We waited with great excitment for Jesse's new album because his previous albums were our absolute favorites. When we put the CD in and started listening our hearts broke. Gone were the taut rapid melodics and captivating progressions, replaced by aimless middle eastern ramblings. Jesse where have you gone? Please come back!"
2,jesse' s free fall(ing down),Tempest and Gravity are real nice recordings by this artist.This one does not approach that level.Too many violins and middle eastern sounds.Do not make my mistake and keep your hands away from it.Govi - Guitar oddyseaAlex Fox - All his workLinstead - Sol luna tierraVillegas - Spanish kissThose are much better cd's.
2,"A departure for Jesse Cook, but not a good one.","I am a Jesse Cook fan - or at least I am a fan of his earlier work. I was quite excited to receive his Free Fall CD, but it is a big disappointment. Although he appears to be attempting to expand his sound and appeal, the departure from his guitar/flamenco base with the addittion of a taste of India, just doesn't work. Gone is the demonstration of his true guitar talents and of a sound that lifted and motivated."
2,Not as good as the others and slightly overproduced.,"I am a big Jesse Cook fan, but I am sorry to say this is not his best effort. I was disappointed by the songs and by the production. The songs lack the fire of Vertigo and Gravity, and the production is overdone - almost forced - and does not sound as natural as Jesse's previous albums."
1,Readers Digest for dot comedy survivors,"The new way to write books1) Search Google using the latest business phrase2) Copy and paste a paragraph from each item you find3) When you have enough paragraphs call it a chapter4) End of book?.....No, go to 1) and repeat with new phrase.....Yes, write another one tomorrow"
3,Required reading,It is well written even for me as a person with no theological studies except for self interest and having to take the course as an aspiring catechist. Only three stars because you will get only the point of view of the Markan priority thinking of how the Synoptic Gospels came about. I imagine there is not time to delve into all the others. I had to do my own work as a few other things didn't seem to sit well with me. It is worth going further into this line of biblical scholarship from viewpoints that do not hold to this method and why so as to see a bigger picture. I am only concerned with Catholic viewpoints. It makes a difference in understanding church and the method Christ chooses to make himself present.Just stay alert and do more digging than the course gives.I am unable to stay with the course at this time but I will plug an overall positive for the experience at UD.
1,A sham,This book was to help with a class offered from the UNinversity of Dayton on Scriptures. I found the book useless.
5,Wonderful,"So excellent, I hardly know where to begin? After watching ""The Dust Bowl"" on PBS, I ordered this book along with ""Whose Names Are Unknown"", by Sanora Babb. I read that one in a day and jumped right into reading the letters of Caroline Henderson. I feel as if I've taken a college course on Prairie life from the 1900's through to the 1950's, amazing."
5,A really interesting account of life in the Dust Bowl,"Carolyn Henderson's diary of sorts is a glimpse into the lives of the brave settlers who lived on the Oklahoma panhandle before, during, and after the Dust Bowl. This along with Sonora Babb's novel ""Whose Names Are Unknown"" are important readings for anyone interested in this era."
2,Bi-lingual babies,"We bought this board book for our three year old daughter. My husband speaks Farsi, I do not. The words are only written in farsi in the book. It would help if there was also a phonetic spelling in English. Also, my husband felt like some of the words were not commonly used or easier versions could be chosen for young children."
1,Room for improvement,"My husband is Persian & we bought this with our 2yr old son in mind. I intend learning with him.As a non-Farsi speaking adult, I am disappointed. The Farsi text is far too small for a youngster, I'm finding it hard enough to distinguish the letters & I specifically wanted to aquaint him with the alphabet.I'm bilingual & judging by my other books, I suspect the book was originally intended for Persians learning English as the English text is much larger.There are no phonetics to help non-speakers with pronunciation.Having said that, I don't fully regret buying it. At least my son is interested in the book, I believe by the bright graphics & the fact that it's a special book only dad can read to him!I'm also grateful there's something on the market at least."
2,Doesn't fit.,"I like the bumpers, but it just doesn't fit. The on/off button is not properly available & the cover needs to be shifted every time I want to use the phone."
5,A Must Read for the International Traveler,"Full of practical information from beginning to the end. The opening quotes for each chapter ""I Wish I'd Known"" and ""I Wish They Knew"" highlight the importance of becoming familiar with a country's culture before traveling or embarking on a business venture outside of the US. I laughed out loud at times ( and hope to avoid some faux pauxs made by others). A good book to read before traveling or while on the plane!!"
1,Junk...,"I was sent An adapter that constantly buzzes, and looses connection. It is made by Etrons and do not recomend this for anyone."
3,Unsure of this one.,"I really liked the design of this product. I think that it is easy to use. But, don't try it on sweet potatoes! They are tougher and when I tried it I ended up busting both of the potato cutter screens. Fortunately, Amazon is sending me a replacement - but I sure won't be attempting to cut sweet potatoes with this product again!"
5,i agree with the two previous reviews,"this book was AWESOME! i really enjoyed it!first of all, it begins where BOBA FETT 5: A NEW THREAT left off. after rescuing himself from being burned alive, Boba is attacked by Asajj Ventress... to be saved by Anakin Skywalker. Anakin brings Boba to Coruscant, where Mace Windu lives..."

3,"Alas, Chinese made is the only realistic option","This part can be made to work only if you have access to a good quality tubing bender to modify the tubing bends. As supplied, the bends are only a vague approximation of the bends in the original factory part. This is a pretty crowded area on the car and the tubing must be re-bent correctly to work. Otherwise the part had satisfactory appearing quality for the price."
3,"A Hole, With Parts","This work is enjoyable reading with fantastic art by Joe Quesada. The David Ross inked issue is especially sharp. Mack's beautiful paintings are a great visual point as well.The main hole is the antagonist: Echo. Her ability to challenge and battle Daredevil is not believable, nor is her VCR regimen. But despite this plot flaw, the book is well written and much more economical in its prose than Kevin Smith's Guardian Devil."
1,Unsafe at any setting!,"While this series of toaster has some good reviews, my experience was a disaster. Everything burns, even at the lowest setting! Smoke is billowing out before the cycle has completed and my smoke alarms were blaring away."
1,Do not buy,"Terrible toaster. Edges of toast burn at setting No. 2. But at setting No. 1, bread does not toast. Bizarrely, the thing goes up to a setting No. 8, though anything above 3 burns it to charcoal. Hopefully I can return this useless, expensive piece of junk."
1,Looks pretty but performs poorly,"Despite the UK label this unit is definitely built in a low cost country, most likely China. As such it suffers from build consistency problems as all of the reviews here clearly show. In some cases, the unit's adjustment is OK and it performs fine. In other cases, including mine, the adjustment is lousy and the toast burns even at the lowest setting. My toaster will be on its way back tomorrow after only one day of use. I have a beautiful 15 year old Rowenta that is made in Germany and is now on its last legs but still produces consistent results every time. I was hoping to buy a quality product made in the US or Europe but all the units I have seen in the stores are cheaply made in China. It is so tragic that we can't get any decent small electric appliances anymore, no matter the brand or the price."
3,"Works ok, edges burn........","If you often toast just one slice, or two, instead of four... expect this toaster to burn the edges, even at low settings.With four slices loaded, the toasts come out nice... crisp and brown.I bought this toaster to toast astisan breads and naans... if the bread occupies the entire space, this toaster works well for them. If the bread is shorter than the space available, the edges come out burnt or worse-charcoaled. If you lower the setting, the edges are fine, but most of the bread's center does not toast.Lacks reheat and defrost button. The toaster's user manual suggests using ""1"" setting for reheat. Tried it, but instead of reheating, it burns the bread.Bagel button works. Decent toaster, overall."
1,not for us,The website I purchased this from won't let me leave a review so I'll do one here. This toaster lasted 3 days before we packed it up and shipped it back. No matter how low the setting the inside edge of the toast burned. If we set it at 1 it wouldn't toast and we had to toast it again and then the whole slice would burn. At 2 the edges would burn. For something over $100 you'd think it would work -at least for a few months. Very disappointed.
1,Uneven toasting,"We've had this toster for about 3 weeks and we're tyring to return it. The toast is uneven both vertically and horizontally, and burns at #4 out of 8. We need a long 4-slice toaster because we buy bread that is wider than regular sandwich bread. This is a real disappointment at $120!"
5,Underground GREATNESS!,"I bought this album because of a review, not ever hearing a single note beforehand, and I have to say it has become one of my favorite albums ever. This is a departure from the (...) on the radio. The sound is a cartoony-80's pop...and it's a perfect cd for long trips. Everyone I play this for ends up buying their own copy!"
4,thats entertainment,"with social dancing, bis is trying to revive the bloated corpe that is recent pop music. produced by andy gill of supercool 80s band gang of four"
2,top pop but too much filler,"Bis are a young Scottish band with a refeshingly different attitude and sound so I wish them well. After hearing the excellent single 'Action and Drama' I went and bought the album. Unfortunately, there are only two good tracks on this, 'Action and Drama' and 'Eurodisco.' Worth having for these tracks alone, admittedly, but it's hard to listen to their energetic screaming on other tracks and funky chicken rythmns without thinking of Japanese punk."
3,"Jesus never claim to be GOD ""note""",Its true if you read the life of Jesus u'll never see where Jesus said i am god worship me? did he? the answer is no u can read the whole bible and even trinity ... ? Jesus and his 12 apstoles never heard of any trinity thing all their lifes.we are following not Jesus just what written in bible.all messengers who came before Jesus like Moses and Abrham and many ... they came with the same message to worship 1 true GOD ... i think they all gone mad by not ordering us to worship Jesus too ... really no idea whats goes wrong ...GOD bless
4,Guide to Gunmarks is right on target,"The Official Guide to Gunmarks is a most valuable reference for identifying all of those (often strange) marks stamped into various parts of firearms. This tome may not include EVERY mark that one might run across, but it is certainly very comprehensive. This book is a ""must have"" for any serious firearms collector."
2,very Average,"these chicks are good writers,but in terms of words&Music together as one they leave alot to be desired as a Group.they are better suited to me working with other Acts.this Album is alright,but it's kinda just there&there ain't a knock out song on this album.i can listen to it,but nothing really stands out to me at all."
3,My Love Affair with Flo'Ology,"I brought this cd yesturday without having to read any reviews because I think that Floetry is one of the groups that consistently put out quality material, so I didn't hesitate to pick up Flo'Ology.I have a great respect for their style, which I think is a breath of fresh air in this day of recycled material music. I instantly feel in love with Supa Star which has a guest appearance from one of my other favorites Common. I then proceded to fall in love with Closer, Lay Down and Feelings but after hearing those 3 my love affair with Flo-Ology ended.I def. like this cd, but feel like they recorded a lot more songs and decided to keep them locked up or perform them while on tour. These 11 songs left me longing for a Getting Late, part 2. Hopefully on their next effort they will satisfy my love for their music with more up-tempo songs and more than 11 tracks."
4,I'm so glad these girls are putting out music!,"On this album Floetry continues to write true feelings of young intelligent women. The music is soulful and laid back. I just chill out when I listen to it. They have chosen to stick with their own sweet, warm, and gently funky style. It's so good to hear young people creating an original sound of their own."
5,Just amazed!!!,Floetry has impressed me so much. Their style and the way they flow is all original. They speak so that you will understand. I'm truly impressed! I hope they continue this long journey together.
5,Second solid album.....,"I love it, at first it was hard for me to get into this CD but it's on. The grooves are all there,""Laydown"" is the ""Say Yes"" for 2005. I love ""My Apology"" Go pick it up it's on sale at Target.Brit soul forever!"
3,I'm disappointed,"I got this cd the first day it came out b/c I loved their first project. I mean this is the group that brought us, ""Say Yes"", ""Hey You"", ""I got a headache"" and originally wrote ""Butterflies"". Anyways I'm just not feeling this cd. The only song I like is ""Feelings"". I wish there were more ballads like ""Feelings"" that showcases the wonderful, wonderful voice of Marsha. I think Natalie can rhyme and has thoughtful lyrics but at times it seems they are almost holding each other back just to be on a song together. Perhaps they could have done individual tracks to really showcase themselves. I don't know, it was like there were too many stylistic ideas in one song. I wasn't feeling this one. Get ""Feelings"" off itunes!"
4,WOW!!!,THESE GIRLS ARE WHAT YOU CALL UNLIKE NO OTHER! THIS ALBUM IS GREAT! BUT I WISH THERE WERE MORE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM. IT'S EVERYTHING I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AND MORE! I CAN SAY THEY ARE ALL THAT PLUS BECAUSE I SAW THEM LIVE IN CONCERT AND THE TRUTH WAS IN THE PUDDING! THEY LEFT ME WANTING MORE....THEY WILL BE AROUND A LONG LONG TIME. GO GET THIS ALBUM IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!
5,Beautiful!!!,"I absolutely loved Floetry's first cd, and didn't think they could live up to that one with their sophomore album. But they've absolutely outdone themselves. You can hear the growth on this album, but at the same time, they haven't strayed from the formula that has gotten them where they are today."
4,A another Solid album for '05,"It's not Floetic but Floetry delivers again with a strong album, both lyrically and production wise. My favorite track is number 5 ""Let Me in"". Nice beat and this time we get to hear Natalie do a little singing with a rap flow. My only gripe is I would like to have seen more songs on the album. But, if other songs were cut due to poor quality I won't hold it against them. Anyways the album is worth your money. Pick it up and support some real artist."
5,A Classic!!,"This is the most beautiful blend of poetry combined with music it's amazing I loved it and look forward to hearing more from these artist! Lay Down,Feelings,and Sometimes you make me smile are among a few of my favorite cuts from this C.D.!"
4,These sister flow,Floetry's music always seem to put me in a relaxed mood. Purchase the cd and see for yourself.
2,Just Okay!!,They are talented but this album doesn't show it. I'm a big fan but I'm real too!! If you never heard their music pick up the first CD and get a bootleg of this one. Just trying to save y'all some money.
2,2.5 stars - below average,"The sophomore slump theory is proven with this album, mostly composed of unnecessary more-than-five-minute ballads."
1,Very disapointing,"First of all FLOETIC was a brilliant album and after I heard SUPERSTAR on the radio I thought FLO'OLOGY was going to be a classic too. I was wrong. This album lacks originality, its inferior to be precise. The first time I popped this CD into the system, I found myself being friends with the skip forward button. The length of the records is despicableThis CD is not worth having....the only track that stands out for me is SUPERSTAR and I think COMMON is amazing"
2,Here comes the truth...,"What is it about neo-soul that makes people feel obligated to give every release five stars? The genre is definitely underrated, and is some of the best music ever, but some is just overrated. Like this album.I adored their first album, although it got some getting used to. But this album could never even compare. It is very lackluster and boring and the only tracks really worth listening to are the first two, ""Blessed 2 Have"" and ""SupaStar."" Otherwise, this is a somewhat mainstream R&B; and overrated set.Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love neo-soul and Floetry, but I will tell the truth; this album isn't worth any of the hype."
5,Solid follow-up that is a Classic!!!,"Very few artists can f/u with an album that exceeds the quality of their first but Floetry has done it!!! It is difficult to determine which album is the best b/c each brings something different with Floetry maintaining their same style, delivery, and flava. Everyone will have their fav but my fav is ""Sometimes U Make Me Smile."" Which song holds the #2 spot??? Hard to choose b/c each song stands out. I am listening to it right now and will remain in heavy rotation. This is just a phenomenal album so pick it up!!!!"
4,Get this CD!,"Initially when I listened to the CD, I was somewhat disappointed. I was expecting a Floetic (which this is not). But by the second and third time I listened, I became addicted. They came just as strong as their first. This CD puts you on a musical high that is hard to come down from. Track after track you will feel this CD!"
2,NOT SO GREAT !,"I am very upset about this album. I bought this album yesterday after reading the great reviews it had on Amazon but I was shortly dissappointed after hearing it myself. It's a typical album. There's nothing that really stands out about it and it comfuses me to see people on here saying crazy stuff like""This is a classic album !"" Do yall really understand the meaning of classic ? Yes, I will admit there was about two great songs on the album other then that it was heartbreaking. Floetry's first album was much better and the second album would never compare. i give it two stars for two great songs. Floetry needs to step up a notch. I'm still a fan and I love the effort that they show."
5,Floetry has a classic here...,"After listening to this album many times, I grow in deeper love with it. This album is better than the first, and is a work of art. Floetry clearly states that they are just that..artists. The production is very solid and the lryics are flowing...This album identifies with many of us, and touches on some real areas. Talk a deep listen, (with a good sound system) and feel the Flology, class is in session."
4,Gedida Grooves,"This is arguably the best showcase for the talents of Natacha Atlas, with its combination of Egyptian seductiveness, traditional instrumentation, and modern grooves built around that enchanting voice. Close your eyes and you can almost smell the air and taste the mysterious aura of the Egyptian culture.The first half of the disc is the best, with Aqaba, Bahlam, Ezzay, and the irresistible Mistaneek shining the brightest. The second half of the disc is much weaker, but still contains interesting tracks such as The Righteous Path. But the power of the first part of the disc makes up for the weakness of the second, and is still worthy of being heard. So do yourself a favor and pick up this disc, especially if you are a fan of world music."
4,Must-have CD for the contemporary bellydancer,"This has become a staple of my bellydance music collection. Most of the dance music I own is acoustic, using traditional middle eastern instruments such as the oud, tabla and kanoun. I am so pleased that Natacha Atlas successfully blended the traditional with the contemporary and created this wonderfully danceable CD. Aqaba and Mistaneek are funky medium-tempo beledi rhythms, while Bahlam and Mahlabeya pick up speed and are probably better suited for the advanced dancer. The ""rap"" track, Bastet, just doesn't work for me, probably because it sounds slightly stiff and unnatural from Atlas. Overall, an excellent addition to the CD collection of any world music fan, and a must-have for the contemporary bellydancer."
4,No Need to Know Arabic to Enjoy the Music,"This CD is incredible, and Natacha's voice is beautiful - full of passion. My only regret is I do not know Arabic so have no idea what these songs are about (except the last cut, which is in English). Particularly good listening is Bastet and Kifaya. If anyone knows the English translation to these tunes please send them along to me!"
5,...Is 5 Stars the Limit?,"HABIBI!! What can I say? As a solo artist, Natacha Atlas has certainly outdone herself on the tri-lingual Gedida. After Diaspora, all I could think of was more-more-more! Then after Halim, I thought she couldn't possibly top this! Then came Gedida and I am floored! Natacha is beautiful in every sense, and her voice is like a fine, melodic instrument. Most of the songs are in Arabic, save her cover of torchy ""Mon Amie La Rose,"" which, evident by the title, is done in French. She even does a very sensous Arabic rap with a little jungle tossed in. The last song, ""One Brief Moment,"" done in English, washes over you like a warm fragrant bath. Acknowledgement of her tremendous range & talent is long overdue. Would like to see her videos played openly but don't want the riff-raff getting their grubby little paws all over this rare jewel... sorry...Natacha, if you EVER read this, you really need to come to the DC area! I will 'zagarheet' in your honor... -gam"
4,Pet bowls,"This is a cute set of dishes. We bought them for our cat for food and water. This set was easy to assemble and as others have mentioned they are easy to clean. The only problems with this product are that we found it difficult to get the legs of the base even (there is a little bit of a wobble) and the bowls themselves can easily fall through the the frame when removing/replacing, so one must be very careful when putting the dishes back after washing/refilling. I don't think the cat can knock them out though; at least ours hasn't yet."
4,Good Read,"I did not know anything about how the French and Indian War started, let alone how it affected what would later be the United States. This book not only informed me on how the war started and why it started, but also the affects of the war had on both sides and who helped the British and French fight the war."
1,That does not give any air,"This thing just does not work, I guess my breath expires more ""fresh air"" than that thing. you need to have the fan clser than 12 inches to feel a little (too litte) breeze, so if do you expect to use it in your car to refreshment in a hot dat, forget it, even in a fresh day, jeje, you will not receive any air from this thing."
2,Might be good if I could USE it....,"Well, it came in a box labelled for paint balls, which was in poor condition. Inside this was the actual air conditioner box, which wasn't in perfect condition, but not as bad as the outside box. I open the box, take out my air conditioner, then reach in for the non-existent instructions. So I'm glad I know how to USE this, even if I could. Because it only comes with an AC adapter for your car, despite the description of ""perfect for your office or home."" Maybe someday I'll be able to use it and find that it works well, but for now it just sits on my desk looking pretty."
5,Martin & Lewis Collection - Vol. 1,"This is a wonderful collection; however, Money from Home (the movie I wanted most) was not included in the collection even though it is listed as being included. This was very disappointed and Amazon should correct this error."
5,Martin and Lewis Vol. 1,"Love this package, beautiful and each disc has two movies on the SAME side of the disc so you dont' have to sweat ruining one side or the other of the cd, bonus points to the producer. It's lovely to have these movies all together! Yeah!twinspin"
5,Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis Collection - Vol.1,Got exactly what I ordered. Very prompt deliver. Received it in about a week.
3,"It's Okay, but not Exactly The Most Amazing Bionicle Ever","If you've been a Bionicle fan since 2001--you know all about the storyline, products, and themes--then you'll probably know Turaga Vakama. He is a simple set, with the ability to move ONLY his right arm by pushing down a lever that is connected to a rubber band. Unfortunately, that is the ONLY part of his body that Vakama can move by pressing a connected piece.Despite his ability to do much, Vakama has an interesting design which had proven popular from 2001-2003. I admire his color scheme (red and orange) and little flame staff. He also has an interesting mask, which--if you known anything about the Bionicle franchise--can turn him invisible.Do I recommend this set? Only to those who are die-hard Bionicle fans."
1,Bitterness overwhelms this book,"This book WOULD have been very useful and accessible for the average person looking for info on the everyday life in Germany. However, the bitterness and underlying resentment completely overwhelm this book. The bad parts are exaggerated, and it seems to poison even the few good factors the author lists-- thus completely ruining both the book and the reader's impression of Germany. It is more a book of the author's commentary about Germany than Germany itself, and is filled with less than entertaining and inspiring anecdotes. But moreover it leaves the reader with a sickly tainted feeling and a twinge of dread for Germany and its people. Sadly, this book could have been a five star if it lost the attitude. If you want to like Germany, DO NOT read this book."
2,I just want the facts sir.....,"This book had some great information for Americans looking to learn more about the real German culture. However, I had to stop reading it because it was too depressing! I was looking for true, factual information, but I was disssapointed that I had to wade through all of the negativity to get it. Great info, not so great writing...sorry, but those are the facts."
2,something's missing,"I read the book with interest, even as I cannot followMr. Lords assesments of the Germans - I've lived there myself for 11/2 yrs and made a lot of good and long lastingfriendships. Nevertheless it was good reading the book and gettingsome information about it. But one very important fact is missing:furniture rental is available at Germany too. ... the guys are doinga fabolous job and it helps feeling at home in a country far away fromhome!"
3,Dry reading,"I've read most of Elizabeth Boyle's books, and ""Brazen Heiress"" is not her best, it's dry, and lacking. They could have put more into her relationship with Web, have more personality to draw them near besides the obvious physical attractiveness towards each other. This book isn't much of a romance book to expect. Right when you see Lily's passion for Web and vice versa, the passion unraveled later lasted only a page, not that passionate at all for the readers to view or realize the true extent of their love for each other. I was hoping to see more of their passion of each other after reading the prologue, but I was left disappointed. I will say though that this book would probably go better if she made this into a drama/mystery/spy book since she focused more on the spying than on the romance department."
4,robo tech the first war,If you like japanese animae the robo tech series all 3 wars are some things you should check out you will be pleasantly surprised
1,I did not receive what I ordered,I ordered a t-shirt for a young Marine who was deploying. It was to be a send off gift. The shirt arrived on time but it was not the one I ordered. All of the paperwork identified the correct shirt but the item sent was wrong. I was tremendously disappointed and all efforts to correct the error have been unanswered. I will no longer purchase from either this company nor Amazon in the future.
5,A book I couldn't get by without!!!,"This is a great book. I refer to it almost weekly to help with household ""problems"". These problems become obsolete after following the tips in this book. A great gift idea!"
5,MUAKA AND KANERA,I JUST GOT TO SAY THIS TOY IS GREAT!AT FIRST WHEN I GOT THIS TOY I JUST STARTED TO BUILD IT.IT TOOK ME LIKE 2 HOURS TO MAKE MUAKA AND KANERA.THEN I JUST STARTED TO PLAY WITH IT WITH MY FREIND.THIS TOY IS REALLY FUN TO PLAY WITH.THEN AFTER I STARTED TO BUILD MUAKA AND KANERA COMBINED WHICH I CALL MUAKA-RA.MUAKA-RA WAS MUCH MORE BETTER BECAUSE IT COULD STRETCH HIS NECK LONGER.FINALLY I JUST GOT TO SAY THIS TOY IS GREAT FOR BIONICLE FANS.
5,"Once you start, you can't stop!!!!!!!!!","I own a few bionicles now and so far Mukata and Kani-Ra are my favorite. It took about 1 day to build Mukata, and about 2 hrs. to build Kani-Ra. The first time I put Mukata together, he wasn't extending his neck properly. I had to go back and rework him. If you don't use the extra pieces to hold the masks in place the masks and arms will fall off. Another good think is that Mukata comes with the rare infected mask. (Highly Collectable!!!) Mukata resembles a tiger and Kani-Ra, a bull. Their awesome. I found out that if you don't take off a certain part below Kani-Ra's head his mouth will not open. The directions say to put this piece on, but I didn't because his month would not open. The only bad thing I can say, is I was missing some small pieces, but I was able to get them from some extra pieces I had from another bionicle (Nuju). These toys were great fun and made a great Christmas gift. Hope they make more."
5,The evergreen Martin Gardner,"As most of Martin Gardner's books, this is an enchantingcollection of puzzles. No author has done a better job at popularizing and illustrating the beauty of mathematics."
3,Very Simplistic and Small Book,Nothing very exciting. Lot more books that are better value in this category on Amazon
2,too girly,I am a female and love Modesitt but when a young couple takes their young baby into battle . . . come on . . . it is plain stupid.
4,Great Series Finale,"The sixth book in a series I found this to be a satisfying ending. There were still some unanswered questions but, I enjoyed the book and the series as a whole."
5,Well Worth the time of a Modesitt fan,I have read almost all of LE Modesitt's work and enjoyed them all. He is able to bring his characters to life and then grow and develop them into better people.This book delves into how the choices made by the Alector Dannil affect his life and the lives around him. This novel also brings the Corean Chronicals full circle.I do hope that Mr Modesitt has considered revisiting this world.
5,Public Debt Education,I suggest that anyone who is concerned about our public debt read this book. Straight forward English used to explain the relevance of public debt.
3,A bit dry,"The criticism in this anthology is a bit dry. I would not recommend this book unless you want to learn all there is to know about Beowulf. Some of the articles are interesting if you are well-versed with Beowulf and its history, otherwise, you will be lost. I think the article about the Sutton-Hoo find was the most interesting piece."
3,Build A Bridge,I own almost every Gaither Homecoming dvd and I must admit this is not one of my favorites. Their is too much talking and not enough singing.
3,Too much screaming for my taste!,"This one didn't do it for me. While I thoroughly enjoyed the interviews with T.D. Jakes, I didn't enjoy the black gospel singers' efforts to out-scream each other on their various collaborations. Not my cup o' tea."
4,very functional,My family loves them. We eat crab a lot and they are perfect for that. My only very minor complaint is that the bottom of the dish turns black from the candle.
5,Lasting Help is Here!,"It's true that the Addiction to Unhappienss is the main idea in this book, but the subtlety with which the causes and effects of this addiction are explained can change the way you view yourself and everyone else. The ideas really stick with me and I find myself with ""aha"" moments all the time in which I suddenly see that I am sabotaging myself or I recognize when someone else is taking their addiction to unhappiness out on me.This is a book you will keep going back to!"
1,I wish I could give it 0 stars.,"Wow, this book is writen in an intensly negative manner. It will tell you (supposedly) why you have these issues and make it clear that you have issues, and that's as far as it gets. It focuses ONLY on your childhood exsperieces and saying that you were not raised properly and then leaves you hanging. Nevermind that I truley think that a good handful of the ""your childhood's to blame"" hypothesises are crap, even if they are the reason, this book tells you absolutly no way to counter act those feelings. I buy books alllll the time and rarely felt like I have wasted my money as I get at least something out of it. Well, this is the first book that I feel like I've wasted my money on. Heck, I have a bodyways book I just picked up that are helping me much more deal with my emotions then this book does. Gah!!"
5,Practical and Inspirational,"I have been so discouraged in my life trying to make changes. This is the first self-help book that has really helped me. First, it described me and my problems exactly both in relation to my work and also my attempts to stay healthy and fit. Then it gave me really down-to-earth suggestions, most importantly including what to do when I hit a wall. For the first time I have been able to get past my failures and keep going on my resolutions. I cannot recommend this book highly enough!!"
5,Revolutionary and effective help!,"Really I am a self-help junkie - have tried everything. This is the first book that has helped me big time and I waited a few months to write this review to make sure everything I learned has stuck with me. Icontinue to make big progress. This is NOT flash in the pan help! Understanding that backsliding is part of the healing process and not an indication of failure is just one of the nuggets that stick with you. And there are lots of excellent suggestions about relationships, health, and work. And if you sometimes go on emotional roller coasters like I do, this book will help you feel much steadier internally - without medication. If you want your life to go better, get this book!"
1,Save Your Money,"I bought this book after reading all the positive reviews posted on Amazon. Let me say I am extremely disappointed. The author's explanation of how we supposedly become ""addicted"" to unhappiness when we are little is so unbelievably simplistic that I must say I strongly suspect this book was churned out to milk the self-help wave. Don't expect ground breaking insights here.As for the positive reviews, I have my doubts. Simply look at the language used, the dates of posting and the locations (Chicago and Kankakee, Illinois, you seem to be teeming with Pieper fans!!)As I said, I am really disappointed. I will not ever touch anything by these authors again."
1,It's Your Parents' Fault & You're Screwed!,"I'm really surprised this book got so many five star reviews, because I didn't think it was very good at all. Probably around page 10 or so, I began to realize that this book is full of itself. Before you shell out $11, I can tell you what this book says in a nutshell: Because your parents ignored and/or disciplined you when you acted up, you now shoot yourself in the foot when you try to achieve something. What can be done about it: Not much, if anything. Other than that, it's chock full of examples of clients who are 'addicted to unhappiness' and how they were cured when they realize how crappy their parents were for not worshipping them and letting them do whatever they want along with the magic of the Piepers' counseling. Those magical counseling methods aren't revealed in this book, unfortunately. I felt this was a total waste of my time and didn't tell me a thing. If you want to get it from the library, go ahead, but don't say I didn't warn you."
3,different color sign post.,"The Peipers give a psycholgical account on presence. They are talking about the same things that people like Eckhart Tolle and Pema chodron talk about but they put their own physicians slant on it which I guess can be OK. All paths lead to Rome.It's just a different color sign post.Though one thing that really irritaes me is that they mention in this book that when their patients start to cancel appointments it means they are avoiding their healing.I have to say that this is more a maniplation and power play of therapists than anything else.The thing that puts this book on a lower level than that of Tolle and Chodron, is the they claim that people need them as opposed to their own presence and God. Though I'm sure it will reach the right people"
1,"Not even one star, the reviews are PLANTED","All the reviews from ""Customer"" from various cities are fake, just false advertising for this very inadequate book. Don't be mislead. Read my real review down below."
3,Knowledge is Power,"I received this book as a gift and it helped tremendously. If you are a novice in the industry - and hopefully there are many of you out there, from secretary to analyst - this book contains the info you need. Also useful for those of us who've been in the industry for awhile, just not exposed to some of the terminology or abbreviations used as we move through the industry and work in various areas. Contains extensive conversion charts. This book is not a detailed technical book, if you need indepth info, look elsewhere. This book covers a wide range of terminology and gives basic info."
3,Very brief look shows incomplete and/or out of date,"I haven't seen the book myself, and I'm sure that it is very good in most areas. However, while discussing it with a colleague who has quoted some of the terms to me by email, my impression that it is probably a bit simplistic, to someone experienced in oilfield operations, and possibly not quite up to date in all areas."
4,A must have for college students,"My nephew recently graduated high school and was about to enter a nearby state university. Long story short, his parents bought him a new laptop as a gift, and I thought this would make the perfect companion piece. After all, you never know when your computer could crash and you lose all your files, right? The only reason I'm witholding one star is that, like a previous reviewer said, it could use a small hole to put it on a keychain (wouldn't want to lose it in a cluttered dorm room!) and the shipping price seemed a little steep for something so small."
4,"Size is in Centimetres, not Inches","I bought two of these -- one for myself, and one for my grandmother so that we could exchange pictures and music files over the sneakernet (from my laptop to her server) -- and haven't been disappointed.Each one can handle about one-third of a CD-R full of data, so when I buy another for my nephew, we can put a whole CD's worth of media across the three of them.Heck, add another, and we can stripe them in a USB-based RAID-5 array to handle an entire CD's worth of data.And the price-point for this USB data thing is just peachy!The only thing missing is a hole for a keyring.Gotta love it!"
4,A good book on an overlooked subject.,"This short but very good book is a summary and analysis of mostly internal events in the Byzantine Empire. The main subject is the rise to dominance of the Phokas and Skleros ""warrior families,"" who came to dominate the command positions Empire's army during this, the military apogee of the Empire. The book is fairly concise, though it is a little thin on background details and context, making it most suitable for someone who knows what's going on already. Ostrogorsky's ""History of the Byzantine State"" can fill in any holes here, though. The in-depth analysis is very good. All in all, a very good book on an often-overlooked period of history."
2,Great Show But Poor Quality DVD,"I was very disappointed with the Cisco Kid Collection 1. I have fond memories of the old series and jumped at the chance to own it on DVD. The video quality is appallingly bad. The main title sequence is blurry. The quality of each episode varies from scene to scene, and sometimes it varies within the same scene from one camera shot to the next. For the price at which this collection is being sold, I expected the episodes to be digitally restored. This series deserves to have the same quality of restoration as the Lone Ranger collection. Maybe someone will do that one day."
4,Erase those pests with the probe,Easy to operate and effective if you remain diligent. Item comes with a good amount of gopher poison for immediate use. Should have done this years ago.....
5,Isham Jones: treasure-trove of great-sounding recordings,"This CD was a revelation to me when I discovered it, not long ago. Isham Jones was a very popular dance band leader in his day, and a wonderful song composer. But he is pretty much forgotten today, unfortunately. This CD should help introduce his music to the curious, and perhaps act as a memento to the lucky ones who either heard him live, or through his records or on radio at the time. For this CD, the producers have drawn primarily from a set of 1935 radio transcriptions, in vivid, rich sound that his commercial recordings from the '20s and '30s cannot quite match. The several selections from 1937, after a reorganization of his band, are excellent, though perhaps not as striking. Isham didn't leave us much from the late '30s and beyond, so this is a fascinating document."
1,Bad Service and Evasions,Product never arrived and when questioned where it was they did make a refund but without answering the question. Note that I ordered *after* Dec. 21 when they supposedly changed shippers. Many of the 5 star reviews must be shills. Do not order from this outfit even if the book seems cheap. Something is very fishy with them and Amazon should give them the boot.
4,Tracking Matching,Excellent book with a very easy exposition of photogrammetry an the newest applications it offers. Very good to understand what's behind camera tracking software in the postproduction market.
4,An excellent book on the Cube of Space,"I bought this as a curiosity a few months back and read it later. This is a quite good book on a glyph which is very powerful and yet mostly unexplored by the Magickian community. The uses for this glyph are numerous and fascinating. If you are interested in new fields of Magickal experimentation and study, I would suggest you buy this book. Very, very interesting."
3,Unfortunately,No mention of Paul Foster Case and his book The Tarot [1934] which has the 1st known illustration of the Cube of Space I am able to reference.Paul Foster Case was a Golden Dawn Member [Canada[ and formed the BOTA - U.S. - there are some G.D. documents regarding the COS.
4,Very compact and great value for the price!,"Pluses:- Very compact: both dips and chin-ups stations are on the same side.- High quality materials for the price.- Price!Minuses:- Due to overhead bar, dips may be a little challenging for tall people (> 6 ft).- Assembly is time consuming.Overall a very strong 4."
1,"This Product ""Towers"" Only Over Ants and the Kids from ""Honey, I Shrunk the Children""",I do not own this item but given that the height is only 5.3 inches I cannot imagine it is very useful for anything other than something to stub your toe on.It does amuse me that Amazon claims that it will fit in a corner. It also will make a nice book-end! Add that to the list of features!
5,Poker table,"Arrived quickly and very nice poker table! It folds up nicely and stores in it's box, the dividers for the poker chips and drinks work very well."
5,A wealth of philosophy - 1,I have read bits and pieces over the years but I decided I needed to do a comprehensive read of all Aristotle's works. The books are in great shape and the translations are well done.
5,MBA in a book,"Substantive, quick & to the point. More than a very good checklist. Mini case studies provide concrete examples of concepts. Focus on just one or two concepts or underlying examples & this book is a winner. A great reference which I plan to consult every six months or so to maintain focus & not drop the ball in some other area of operations."
2,Nothing New,"I bought Lee's Planning Guide, Deployment Guide, and Survival Guide as one package. I read through the first two and was dissappointed to find nothing particularly revolutionary. Many of the concepts were ones I learned years ago in basic strategic planning. For $... this and the deployment guide fall way short on value.That being said, I read the Survival Guide and was extremely pleased. The detail that was lacking in the Kinkos assembled planning and deployment guides was plentiful in the Surival Guide. It was an easy read and clearly and honestly points out the pitfalls of CRM implementation. The survival guide also has much more ""how to"" and references real life situations with which the reader can identify.Spend the $... on the Survival Guide and save your money on the rest...unless you know nothing about strategic planning, understanding customer needs, and facilitating team activities."
1,Disappointed,"This so-called guide was a big dissapointement, especially for the price. If Dick Lee's sequel to this one, 'The Deployment Guide', (also for the same price) is anything like this one, I would strongly recommend against buying it. Mr. Lee's Customer Relationship Survival Guide provides just as much information on CRM for a fraction of the cost."
2,Disappointed,"Never mind the booklet being bounded improperly, I was quite disappointed at what I received for.... This does not bode well for this 'marketing' type who has a sequel called the deployment guide."
2,Didn't make that much,Thought this would have made more plaster id go with premixed plaster next time most defenetly but this will do the job just watch cus it sets real fast
2,its probably good for something,"i bought this stuff for the price and wasted my money. it breaks easily when mixed properly, it is too watery. its good for covering nail holes in walls but thats it."
2,too sloppy,"I'm a big fan of anything cyrpto and was excited for this book a few years ago. Although it is full of differenct thunderbird encounters, opinions, and ""facts"", the book is too jumbled and sloppy. And also the encounters are just paper thin with no opinions or explanations... just the encounter itself. Which left much to be imagined. So if your looking for a book on thunderbird encounters then this should cover it, but if your looking for something more informative then look somewhere else."
3,Caution: extremely religious!,"While the advice in this book is valid, anyone who is not profoundly Christ-centered may find themselves uncomfortable with the Bible references and Christian focus on every page. If you're looking for a secular goal-oriented book to motivate yourself with, I'd suggest checking out ""The Power of Focus"" by Jack Canfield, Mark Victor Hansen and Les Hewitt. (The Chicken Soup for the Soul series guys). Packed with information, yet humorous enough to keep you reading, it's twice this book without the preachy-ness! (and not at twice the price, either)."
2,Zen Tarot,When I recieved this book I was expecting alot more about the connection between Tarot and Zen. I love the Zen Tarot card deck but was not able to relate to the book like I wanted.
1,RRrrrrrrrrr,"today i recieve Tarot in the Spirit of Zen: The Game of Life with Cards in the mail. i'm not very happy with the product i received. i only ordered this item because it says that i comes with cards. full sized tarot cards for me to use the book with. i didn't order this so that i can get a book full of information about tarot that i can't use. oh i forgot to mention it says with cards, but it doesn't mention the size of them, 2 by 3 cm. plus theres only around 10 of them with little pictures you can hardly see. i have returned this item."
4,Illumination,"The Osho Zen Tarot deck is one of my favorites. This book adds a dimension & illumination & depth to the meaning of the cards &, yet, does so in simple, down to earth language & ideas. I find it very helpful if I am feeling some resistance to a particular card. It is also an interesting read even without the deck."
3,Ok - the book in the Osho tarot is better,"This book is ok. To be honest the book that comes with the Osho Zen Tarot is far more useful and practical than this more detailed version. I love the Osho Zen Tarot and I think the cards speak for themselves, clients just 'get' the meanings."
5,Deeply spiritual yet completely oriented to real life,"I have used this book for my Lenten devotions over a number of years. I discover something fresh and wonderful every time I read it. Fr. Smith's journey in and with the Holy Spirit is not an exercise in escaping from the world around us, but an invitation to become more aware of how the Reign of God is active here and now. Although geared towards Lent, the readings are well worth perusing any time of the year."
5,Martin L. Smith is a blessing!,This book helped my Lent to be very powerful and profound. I felt that it had been written just to answer my questions and to challenge me to grow in my spiritual life. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a prayerful Lent.
2,How Many Minutes Left?,"that's what i kept asking myself. the characters have no redeeming qualities, and do not evolve. borrrring! Benning's character is a caricature."
3,ANNETTE BENING SEDUCES,"When Annette Bening leans naked in a doorway in a seductive and bold posture, that lingering, unexpected image defines the cool criminality of this neo-noir. Stephen Frears's adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel twists our discomfort with the primal relationship of mother, son and girlfriend. The latter two played by John Cusack and Angelica Huston.The central conceit here is suggests that a life devoted to running the con corrupts the most basic of relationships and values. Well, duh. The world of the story seen through the eyes of the con-artists and is filled with either ""grifters"" or ""squares.""This same world-view seems to have permeated the politics of capitalism.In light of today's national economic woes, how ironic that we once called chiselers ""confidence"" artists."
5,Treat Your Children Well,"'The Grifters' is so far removed from most people's reality that it lives in that netherworld called a fairy tale or maybe even more to the point a nightmare.The world of 'The Grifters' is a world of bookies, murder, torture, betrayal, incest and of course, thievery. Some of what goes on; especially in the beginning involving Lilly (Angelica Huston) at the racetrack is so complicated as to become Byzantine in nature.But at the core of 'The Grifters' is the odd, fascinating relationship of Lilly and her son Roy (John Cusack) that plays out like a modern day Oedipus Rex. And isn't Myra (Annette Bening), Roy's girlfriend really Lilly as a younger woman? And isn't that why Lilly can't stomach her?Stephen Frears directs with a magical eye on all the details both physical and personal. And Huston, Cusack and Bening have never been more emphatically truthful since. This is inspired filmmaking of the highest order."

3,companion switch is a problem,The instructions for installing this switch were clear and I was able to install without much trouble. The switch works well. The problem came when I went to put the switch plates back in place. The holes in the companion switch (the smaller unit of the two) are not the correct size for standard screws that are used on all U.S. switch plates. I had to drill out the holes to get the original mount screws to work. The switch should either have the correct mounting holes or come with screws that fit.
3,"nothing wrong with it, just the x10 part",I have complaints against the actual product. But the x10 technology. I would recommend researching and investing in a better technology backbone for you home automation needs/desires.
1,Screw size wrong!,Same problem as other reviewer. Could not install switch cover on slave unit. Hole too small. I'm not going to drill and use special screws. totally unacceptable product! Will be returning 3 sets.
3,A narcissistic attack on the most succesful recovery program,"Cult or Cure? offers little objectivity. The author, Bufe, clearly misinterprets the simple spiritual principles of A.A. Assuming that 2 years in that Fellowship alloted him the credentials to unabatedly bash is his biggest fault. Experienced members of the Fellowship often claim to go through their own ""grinding axes"" with A.A. So, the topic is nothing new, but it can be dangerous inasmuchas turning away a potential ""member"" from this life-saving program. But, A.A.'s General Service Office will never comment, because they, unlike Bufe, stay away from having their name drawn into public controversy."
1,Feh!,"AA never said it had all the answers to drinking problems. Big Book (Alcholics Anonymous) said it had a way that worked with them. At the time Big Book was published in 1939, one hundred and two people stoped drinking. Since then millions."
2,prejudice,bill wilson influnced by the oxford group this sure doesnt take a rocket fuel engineer to figure out now does it? the aa program tells you that bill w. was influnced by the oxford group from the very begining. can this guy tell me that he absolutly didn't use anything he heard in aa to finally get sober no more that i can say having been raised by loving parents didn't help me! then if he did use somthing in aa then he didn't get sober on his own did he? the oxford group has roots in the church of england maybe it was somthing henery the eighths first wife said that got us sober!
4,An Eye Opener,"This book completely changed my life. Before I thought AA and other 12 step groups were above criticism. That they were perfect programs. Charles Bufe has showed that nothing is perfect. By having the courage to show the true secret history of AA, he has provided an invaluable asset to society. Criticizing the big book and the 12 steps is like taking on the Bible. However, the author does so with style and grace. He does not hesitate to point out the good aspects of AA, but also shows the dark side of the program. This book definitely has made me see 12 step groups differently. I now have a healthier perspective of the whole movement."
4,A Book to convince the unconverted,"Anyone who has been to AA meetings and witnessed the prevalence of people falling to their kness in prayer to their Higher Power, mentions of ""GOD"" and Our Lords Prayer knows that AA is a religion based on spirituality - just like Christianity.Anyone who has also been to AA meetings and witnessed the sputtering and stuttering of the average meeting attendee reading through the simpleton's English of the Steps and Traditions knows that AA is not exactly a hotbed of intellectualism.This book is really for the curious, but none the worse for that. Recommended if you want to understand AA's false promises."
1,Other views,Isaac Asimov (one who has a much greater intellectual capacity than the author... and myself) said that the greatest product to come out of America in the 20th century were the twelve steps of Alcoholics Anonymous.
1,"Mother Didn't Hold Him, or Held Him Too Much","The author is on a crusade to say AA brainwashes, when in fact, we are free to do and say what we want. It is likely he had a parent or friend who was unwilling or unable to get sober in AA, or was perhaps court ordered. The book reeks of contempt prior to investigation. Read the truth at [....]"
4,Was a good help.,"I found the interpertations of the Egyptian deck were some of the most helpful to me in understanding the major arcana. What I did not like was that the pictures were in black and white, which somewhat distorted the color symbolism that I understand was used. Some of the pictures have astrological components added to them that are additional to the basic meanings, and there are also cultural concepts from the Egyptian Era that may be misleading if taken in the context of the present time, but overall, it was very helpful to me as a beginner at Tarot analysis."
2,Pocket Dictionary of Lynch,"If you have read any works on David Lynch this one will come as a crushing disappointment.Sections on the works of Lynch are rendered in language we would expect from the webpages of alt.culture. The authors clearly love Lynch's work, but this doesn't excuse their inability to ground their comments in any form of cultural discourse.While it does cover some of the more obscure areas of Lynch's work (particularly the early stuff) the reader will garner little more than trivial tidbits. A beginner's guide to say the least.C. James Brown"
2,Disappointing Debut!!!,I didn't get into this album to much it was like real wack to me after listening to the first couple of songs.
4,Hear Lenny Get Arrested,"A good CD with some great sections (and some not to great sections). The most interesting thing about the CD is listening to the cops arresting Lenny on stage (which they did many times over the course of his career!).Not for the uninitiated, but a good CD for those who appreciate Lenny."
2,does not work with all Bighorn models,"It does not say so here or on Backcountry.com or on Yakima's website, but the box clearly states that it is only compatible with the Bighorn 4 part # 02404. If you have an '03 or older Bighorn rack, you are better off getting a converter that changes your 1-1/4"" reciever to a 2"" one (they can be found for about $35)."
1,waterproof camera cover.,it broke and camera was ruined after about 3 uses! Sony reimbused camera and gave us money back for cover because it was a known problem.
4,Nice addition for the adventurer,"I've had this case for awhile and on the few occasions that I've used it, it's been great! The W-series camera on the other hand is a bit of a different story. Both my girlfriend and I have a W-series (different versions), and they both seem to handle image stabilization poorly.Back on to the waterproof case -- a good buy, especially for those who like water-activities!"
5,Fantastic Waterproof Cover!!!,Do not waste your money buying those one time use water cameras! They will only work if it is sunny out and still only half of your pictures will come out. With the Sony waterproof case it is like having a camera that was made for underwater pictures. It is simple to put your camera in and simple to use your camera once it is in the case. I highly recommend the Sony case!! You will not displeased anymore finding out you have a junk roll of film.
5,Live time lover of Four Freshman!!,"I enjoyed the songs I heard but since I am familiar with all of the FF's things, I can say that it was great automatically. I have been a fan of theirs (won't give away my age) since I was in junior high school in Cleveland. The minute I heard them I knew I was hooked forever!! That's how it is with this type of music. I now enjoy hearing the new Four Freshman and seeing them perform in Cleveland at Nighttown (I visit once a year and have been lucky to fall on them). Anyone interested in talking about them, write me. Joyce s"
3,Ambivalent.,"This book is good if you're quite the beginner. Not very helpful if you've been around the block. It's cheaper to do a google search and read a few REAL scientific papers BUT the articles in here are informative and interesting. If you like rules and need a lot of guidance before writing, it's a great choice."
3,too old to worth the price,"in summary, the book is too old to worth the price of more than $70, and has no reciept with it."
5,Tonal Brilliance,"My buddy was helping to record my band, and when I ran my bass through this thing, it really opened up the tone. I have an active pickup Warwick 5 string going through an SWR SM400 out of an Ampeg 8x10... My tone prior to the Black Finger was really good, but the Black Finger just took it over the top!!! We used it more as a preamp than a compressor, since the introduction to 2 more 12AX7 tubes really allowed for us to push the sound. I drove the 12AX7 in my SWR head too hard and fried it, but I'd do it again if I got that tone. As far as using it as a compressor, we didn't really look to compress my sound as much as add a great deal of drive to the gain. I suggest trying it. We drove the input up and the output down, causing it to overload, giving that push."
4,Terri Walsh is the real deal!!!,"Terri Walsh is the real deal!!! She is a trainer with proven client results (check out the ART Method YouTube videos and private Facebook group)and expertise that can only come from a couple of decades in the field. If you've been injured by doing a fad program that you weren't strong enough for, she can help you build functional strength and progress when YOU are ready. Get this DVD as a first step and then move on to her online streaming classes that will debut this month.The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is that I would like to have had an option to turn off the music and still hear her voice. It's just standard exercise video music, not awful, just not my favorite."
1,Emptiness... void... nothingness...,"See, I was expected some sort of deployment guide when I spent the 175 dollars. What I received was not a guide. What I received was broad strokes on poorly crafted paper. This was not what I was expecting and the book was returned."
5,For Kids of All Ages!,"Sue has an amazing prescence and energy that kids of all ages will enjoy! Don't be afraid to dance, laugh and sing along."
2,Very unimpressed- returning for something better.,"This is my first headset. I'm using primarily for Internet chat while gaming. I wouldn't recommend this headset for a couple reasons:1) The arm length is NOT adjustable. The arm was lodged into the side of my face and the mic was in my mouth. The mic can be twisted a bit, but to get it out of my mouth I had to twist it so it was pointing straight out. My roommate had the same problem. If you have a tiny head you may be able to wear these properly.2) The padding on the ears is very unsubstantial. After about an hour of gaming my ears ached from the hard plastic of the ear pieces digging into my ears.The voice quality (for chat anyway- didn't play music or game sounds through the ear pieces) was fine and the volume/mute controls worked as expected. I'm returning these though because they're unusable on an average sized human male face and weren't engineering for long term use (over an hour)."
2,Bad Design.,"I bough those for about 20 bucks at local walmart and wish I havn't wasted money. For over the computer internet chats the sound quality is preatty good but the really bad part is the design. The microphone is way to short and is resting on your cheek when wareing, the ear phones are also uncomfortable since there is no left/right side you can put them on both ways.Fot this kinna money there are better products out there. Stay away from this one."
4,8 out of 10,This is my first drum sander and it does a good job. The only problem is that the drum head was not parallel to the base. It was frustrating to align properly.
5,Jet (Performax) 22-44,"Just assembled my 22-44. Assembly was easy, It would have been even easier if I would have had some help, the drum head is HEAVY. When you are stupid you have got to be tough...The unit was spot on and required no adjustments. Hooked up the dust collector and went to work. I am amazed, this machine is something I will never be without, and wish I would have bought one earlir. It takes the cupping of the wood out and NO snipe at either end. Couldn't be happier..."
2,very disappointed,"i had looked forward to the new novel by lee child as i have en joyed the jack reacher books so much.. to say i was disappointed is an understatement. i found the plot preposterous, the characters stereotypes and the writing far below his normal standard. i hope that this is an aberration... as jack reacher had become such a favorite of mine"
3,Not one of Lee Child's best work,"Jack Reacher is still a captivating protagonist but this book is definitely not one of Lee Child's best work -- Storyline is a bit predictable, the abused wife wasn't a lovable character, and worst of all, I really don't need to be constantly reminded of how hot Texas is. I literally started sweating just reading it."
2,worst Reacher book,"Nothing even remotely believable or interesting about this book. Even gets into political issues. Not good. I've read all the Reacher series, and can't believe this one's so bad."
3,WHAT!!,"My husband has read 4 or 5 of his books, He has liked them untill this one. WE live in Texas. If you are white and live in Texas you will have a problem with this one."
3,Product was in very bad shape,"standard shipping, the condition was supposed to be good but it was missing a cover and REEKED like cigarette smoke. will not be ordering from them again."
5,Another Reacher classic by the master,"Brilliant as usual, if you like reacher books as much as I do try Soft Target by Conrad Jones its same genre but twice the bang for your buck. Real gripping stuff, he could be the next Lee Child !!! More of both please guys !!"
3,Little to Say,"This novel is 354 pages in length. If one excised the phrase, ""Reacher said nothing."" you would end up with a 93 page novella.Still, a good, taut read for Lee Child fans. Save it for the beach but bring something else to read. If you start this book at 9:00 AM, you'll be finished before the noon tide goes out."
4,Very Unpredictable Plot and Ending,"This was my second Lee Child novel featuring his protagonist, Jack Reacher, and I very thorougly enjoyed the story. Jack Reacher,an ex MP from the Army, is a drifter who is hitching a ride in a small rural town in Texas and picked up by a mysterious woman who tells him she's in trouble. The problem is that much of her story does not add up and Reacher, being an ex-cop, becomes suspicious of her.A very intense novel with many twists and turns throughout much of it. A very enjoyable reading for those who like action packed mysteries."
3,Getting a bit formulaic,"I started off thinking this book was just more of the same from Lee Child and that it was all getting a bit formulaic but as I got more into it I found myself really enjoying it. Jack Reacher is such a great character and is now very familiar to me and I like that he doesn't ever act out of character, although that doesn't make the stories any less unpredictable. Yes, another great read, and although, initially, i was thinking this might be my last Jack Reacher - I'm ready for another already!"
4,Typical Reacher,Good tale in typical Lee Child fashion. If you like the previous Reacher's books you will also like this one.
4,Slow starter,For a Reacher novel this one started slow. Once into the story line things moved at a normal pace. It had a more satisfying conclusion than many action books.
3,Echo Burning,Not as exciting as previous Reacher books. I think I'm spoiled. The series has been fantastic so I guess you get a dud occasionally
5,Echo Burning,All of Lee Child's novels are excellent. The Jack Teacher series are spellbinding. Echo Burning was gripping from beginning to end. I`m. Looking forward to the next book.
3,Pretty good...,"I am a huge Reacher fan, and I enjoyed this book. Unlike any of the other Reacher books I have read, I figured out the bad guy and the ""surprise"" ending halfway through the book. All in all, I would read it again."
4,Lots of twists that kept you guessing.,It kept me turning the pages. All Lee Child fans will enjoy the action and suspense. Intriguing and colorful characters..
2,Echo Burning Jack Reacher #5 Huge Let Down,"Terrible story line, female character very watered down. Almost didn't finish it. I love Jack Reacher and this one almost ruined the series for me."
1,Waste of time and trees,"I just couldn't slog through this book...although I keet hoping it would FINALLY get interesting. The plot (well, up to page 158 when I tossed it into the rubbish) was just so silly. I like Jack Reacher as much as the next girl, but I just couldn't believe that a woman (Carmen) could be so, so, so...doormat...in the 21st century. I had to keep reminding myself that this story was not happening in the 1950's or even 60's. Jack (and Lee) you deserve better."
4,Reacher in the Deep South,"Another excellent reacher novel with great action and I enjoyed the details about Texas. The characters were most interesting- reminded me a little bit about the night time soap- ""Dallas"""
5,Echo Burning,"I have never been disappointed yet with any of the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child, perhaps I have developed a literary crush! Once again, Reacher finds himself inadvertently caught up in someone else's problems but can't walk away due to his strong moral values. Great stuff!"
4,Good but not jacks best,This is quite a good read I am absolutely in love with jack & can't put his books down but this book was a little slow & not as action packed & heart racing as the others... Still a good read don't skip it if you are reading the series but don't rush out & buy either it's a book to borrow...
1,Not very good,"Long, boring and shallow. Wow, the book is long, because he fills most of it describing the heat and the Texas landscape. Had to fill the pages with something because there wasn't any story. Good grief......I read the first four books in the Reacher series, but this is the last."
3,Kinda of disappointed,"I have read the 1st four of Lee Childs Jack Reacher novels and this was my fifth. I would have to say I was a little disappointed by the lack of action. In all the previous books Mr. Reacher was a very physical fellow and it is what I enjoyed most, however this novel lacked the action of the others. It is a minor flaw and I enjoyed the book pretty much but felt it didn't live up to the others. I just purchased book #6 and I hope he is a little more active."
4,Jack in Texas,Sure can't get enough of Reacher - this is a darn good book and I love the change of pace from NYC and the FBI to Jack hitchhiking in Texas. Much happier when he's on his own.
4,awsome child,Cheap and fast delivery of this unabridged audiobook. Not my absolute favorite reacher book but very very good. Only downside I can think of is the cheapish box the discs come in. I don't mind but worth mentioning.
1,One of Child's worst,"This is my fifth Reacher book, and it is by far Child's worst. It is long and boring, and a number of his facts are plain wrong- shame on Childs."
4,"Feel the Texas heat, but a little contrived","Once you get into a Jack Reacher book, it is very hard to put down. Lee Child is a master of suspense. The book is set entirely in Texas, and Child vividly makes you feel the heat and feel as though you are part of the vast expanse.I do wish though that Child could master something else. Without spoiling the story, the plot resolves with a seemingly minor incident that Reacher learns about accidentally becoming the major part of the story. I remember this clearly in the first Reacher novel as well. I'm hoping that Child doesn't continue to use this device throughout the series."
3,Central Political Premise,"I listened to the audiobook and Dick Hill could read the telephone book and make it exciting and enjoyable. However, I wish I had known that the central premise of the book was in support of illegals living in the United States without legal documentation and remaining that way. And bashing the State of Texas and its government. I am not swayed by the author's misuse of the bully pulpit and I hope other readers and listeners are not influenced by the not so subliminal political tripe. To accuse the U.S. Border Patrol, fictional or real, because they do their job is disgusting. If other of Childs' books embrace this same or like premise, I for one will not read or listen to any of his written words. Come on, Lee, get off your high horse and write fiction w/o the political BS."
3,REACHER NUMBER FIVE,"In Lee Child's fifth Reacher book, Jack is out in the Texas desert country trying to help Carmen Greer. This was the least favorite of the first five books. Oh, I will read the next one and the others but this one was a little long and for me didn't get interesting for about one hundred and fifty pages or more. Reacher is a great character but ECHO BURNING isn't as good as the other four."
3,Child's Play,"Lee Child cranks out these Reacher books at a surprising rate so it probably explains why he doesn't hit a home run every time at bat. Still, it's a good read and an infield hit that he stretches out to get on base.Will I read more in the series? Oh yeah, I'm a fan in the stands."
3,Predictible again,"When I read Running Blind, i was rather dissapointed, and expected to be knocked off my feet with the follow up. I was wrong. Child has put forth another dissapointing novel. Just like Running Blind, It is very easy to figure out the solution long before the end of the story. It is better than Running Blind, in that it has some of the characteristics of a great Jack Reacher novel, such as a great fight in the desert, but the conclusion of the book just doesnt leave you guessing. If you havent read Lee Child yet, then this may be a good first book for you to read, and then you could go back to the first three and be amazed. I dont suggest it to anyone that has read him before, because it is very predictible.Hopefully, Child can come up with something better that leaves readers guessing. Also, i wouldnt mind another book written in Reachers point of view, as Killing Floor was, which made it, in my opinion, the best of all Jack Reacher novels."
5,Keep a cool drink nearby as you read Echo Burning.,"Lee Child takes the reader into the unbearable heat of Echo, Texas as Jack Reacher tries to help a beautiful woman and her six-year-old daughter. Reacher has to sort through a web of truth, lies, and half-truths. Just when he has everything figured out, all the evidence points to different suspects and motives, and the closer Reacher gets to the truth the more his own life is at stake. Echo Burning is suspenseful from the first page until the spectacular climax. The biggest problem I had with the book was trying to put it down long enough to sleep."
2,Confusing,This is the first Lee Child book I have read and probably the last. We will see. The story starts out being one thing and then changes into something else. A very confusing story. It made me wonder what is this book about?
2,Not This One,"A few weeks ago I picked up my first Reacher novel - and enjoyed it. So I decided to work my way through all of them. So far I have had a good time with each one. But I got to Echo Burning and it just didn't measure up. I know it's fiction but right in the beginning I had to get over the fact that it was supposed to be 100 degrees before the sun comes up in the morning, in Lubbock. Everyone, especially those of us from West Texas, know that the desert is know for its cool nights - even when it gets up to 120 during the day. So that bothered me first, but what really got me was the premise that the white people out here treat latinos like slaves or worse. Again, I know this is fiction, but in reality the mexican people are by far in the majority out here, and they are well respected, leaders in each community. I guess just not in the fictional ones! Beyond those details that may only have bothered me, I just thought the plot was weak and the anticipated climax was a let down."
5,Echo Burning,"The setting of the story is West Texas and I could relate to it really well, having lived near the area. I love Jack Reacher's way of setting people straight. He's a man who knows what he's about and not afraid to stand up to anyone.This is the second Jack Reacher novel I've read and I ate it up like it was candy. I can't get enough of this guy and will continue buying Lee Child's novels."
2,Echo Burning,"As a ""big"" fan of the Jack Reacher series I was disapointed in this book. It was weak and very boring. Too many damn details of stuff I could care less about. I don't know how I got through it. His other books are gripping right from the start. By the time this got interesting I lost interest."
5,Reacher Reaches New Levels of Excellence,"As the author of a mystery series set against a multicultural backdrop, I found Lee Child's new Jack Reacher novel, ECHO BURNING, fascinating. It takes place primarily in Echo, Texas. Reacher, Child's tough yet honorable protagonist, is aiming to protect Carmen Greer, a Hispanic woman, from her husband. The husband has served time in prison, and he blames his wife for the conviction. Carmen fears her husband plans to pay her back for what has happened. In this thriller, Child addresses the issues of discrimination and domestic abuse while telling a fast-paced story. ECHO BURNING is a terrific book, perhaps Lee Child's best yet."
2,Blah,I would skip this entry of the series. Not worth the $10 bucks. Does not really add to the lengend of Jack Reaher.
3,Echo Burning,I thought this book was a bit redundant and I will hesitate recommending it to friends. The premise was trite and the plot was pretty obvious.I usually like Childs books without qualification.
2,Pass on this one,This is a Reacher to skip. Story makes no sense and is not very interesting.Not up to par with the others in the Reacher series.
1,Great ending,Jack pulls it out in the end. He still relying on his military training to get him out of trouble
4,Echo burning,I Have read several Reacher novels and the first few are the best. Look forward to reading the few remaining originals.
3,Echo Burning,"I love the Jack Reacher series, but this book was a little too violent for me. I did like the ending, however."
3,Jack reacher seems to attract trouble like steel to a magnet.,"Not the best of Jack Reacher novels, but at least he is, again, the noble knight errant, only after learning to ride his horse. This one is a bit predictable, but the description of the landscape stretches the mind's image wider than a tv screen ever will. The body count rises as the tempo picks up, but it takes a while to get into the groove."
4,Guilty Pleasure,"These books are my guilty pleasure. This one delivers just what you expect - two-fisted, hyper-macho Jack Reacher shenanigans. If you like these books, this is a good one."
4,Fast Moving,Just finished Echo Burning which is fast moving and exciting Lee Child novel.Entertaining with some interesting twists and turns.Enjoyed the book very well.
2,Predictable,"After initially being captivated by the Reacher novels - I've read six now, I am able to predict each plot turn and frankly am now bored. The plotting was predictable, the character development was missing as was my interest."
2,Conspiracy did not make sense,"I can ignore character flaws that might cause bad decisions, but the conspiracy plot twist went too far and ruined the book for me. There was no reason for the kidnapping and the forced confession. Justice would have moved along without this unnecessary risk. Also the ambush in the desert did not make sense. Professional killers would not act so stupid. How did the villains even know they were at the ranch? First Reacher went to the ranch, then back to the DA's office to steal a file, and then back to the ranch for no apparent reason."
3,Not Child's best Jack Reacher novel!,"Child's endless description of how HOT the weather was really distracted me. Unusual for him. I usually gobble up his books with no complaints. Tell you the truth, I can't recall how it ended."
4,"one of the best Reacher novels, intense climax","I have been reading all tof the Reacher books in order, and after the first 5 I still think the first one, Killing Floor, is still the best. This is the second best so far. The intensity builds slowly, and the one sequence towards the end where Reacher is stalking/being stalked in the woods at night during a thunder and lightening storm was unbelievably intense and pulse pounding!The scorching Texas landscape lent the book a vivid sense of place and there was more of a mystery element than the last few books. Highly recommended!"
1,Yuck.,"Lee Child started out with some pretty fine novels in his series featuring the ex-military cop, now drifter Jack Reacher. Reacher seems to have a penchant for landing in some rather outlandish and bizarre situations. Unfortunately, Child lost his touch in this one. ECHO BURNING is a slow, drawn out, and rather boring novel. While RUNNING BLIND, his last novel, was a terribly unbelievable and contrived plot - at least there was plenty of swift, moving action that kept the pages turning. Here we get long, unnecessarily detailed descriptions of Reacher sleeping, Reacher driving in a car, the melodrama of a six year old trying to figure out how to open a locked door. This reader kept saying ""let's get on with it already!!""This was a rather slow and disappointing story."
5,Echo burning,Excellent read keeps you interested from the start to finish. I love Jack Reacher. Checking out next book in the next day or two.
4,Just started,"I got started reading this series because of the movie,which I have not seen yet. Read 1 -2 and loved them just working May through the series."
5,Excellent read,I'm a nee Reacher fan. This is my 5th book and probably my favorite so far. Couldn't put it down.
3,Not as good as some,"I am a Lee Child (Jack Reacher) fan, but this book was pretty boring. The plot was predictable and the characters forgettable."
3,Quick Read,"This is not one of the best Reacher books, but still not a bad read. I found that the story line was somewhat unbelievable even for Jack Reacher. Also, the story line was quite obvious very early if one is paying attention, the only suspense left was how Jack was going to put it together to get at the truth. His relationship with Carmen was head scratching to me, I never figured out why Jack was going to all the trouble in the first place.I would recommend the book as it continues the sequence of all the Jack Reacher books, but certainly not one of Lee Child's best effortsDVG"
2,Seemed like he had to write a book inbetween his good books... Reachers gone soft on this one!!!,"I did not like this book, the story line was thin, Jack Reacher is not the Reacher from the previous books, he makes mistakes and is far less violent. This seems that Lee had to fill in some time or fill a quota with this novel, not enjoyable."
4,Reacher got sucked to get a woman out of domestic violence,"Love the descriptions in driving for hours every time the characters needed to go from one place to the next in echo county, May be the least populated municipal in USA outside of Alaska. The crimes and Reacher heroics made it memorable indeed."
5,as you can see,as you can see by my buying habits i've been buying lee child's reacher left and right because I love this series and before i'm done I will have read every one
4,Always good character building and suspence.,"I was glad Jack used a little integrity, for a change, and did not jump in the bed with the woman. Always good characters in Child's books."
4,A little on the strange side,"I liked it fine, but the plot was a bit strange. Still a fan of Reacher's ability to command the action though."
2,Quite an unbelievable story.........,"The story in this one is too far-fetched for me.....why would a guy go to that length to protect someone he hardly knows? And there are definitely privacy act issues here....he gets into everyone's business, and the DA, lawyers, sheriffs--everyone tells him all about their clients. Get real!"
5,The Best,Lee Child's Jack Reacher series is the best series I have ever read. Hard to put the book down once you start. After I read one my husband reads it. We both think Lee Child's writing is detailed and fast paced and we like that.
5,Another great jack Reacher adventure,"You can count on lee Child to write another pager turner about Jack Reacher. Good plot, surprise solution and of course Jack gets his man. Great series, great fun"
4,Good story,"Any Jack Reacher book is a good one, but you get to see a soft side of him with his interaction with the child character in this plot line."
2,very slow middle 1/3 .,"Very slow mid 1/3. Way too much about how HOT it is in south west Texas in the summer, we know that.The end finally picked up however.I will continue reading Lee Child books ,because I like all the others---7 of them."
2,Uninteresting and tedious,"The first 70% of this book was boring and by the time I got to the 'exciting' part I was tired of the book and just wanted to get trough it, so I ended up skipping a lot of pages because the book made me rather listless.I was ready to pull my hair out if I'd read another, 'He/She shrugged'."
3,Echo Burning,"Texas dominates this Jack Reacher novel. The Texas heat can be felt, & the story is one you can sink your teeth in, although some sections are more 'filler' than seems necessary."
2,Good thing this wasn't my first Lee Child book...,"I finish 99% of the over 100 books I read and or listen to a year. If I had not been listening to this book when I couldn't download another, I may never have finished it. I have read most of them, you don't need this one for any information in the others, so unless you just want to say you read all the Reacher books, you don't really need to buy this one.The other books more than make up for this one. No one is perfect and Lee Child has given us some great books!"
5,One of the best in the series.,"If you are new to the series Jack Reacher is a former Army MP, part Rambo and part Columbo, who wants nothing more than to travel around the country. Through plausible plot setups, Reacher finds himself in a position to help.This book starts with Reacher being asked to kill a woman's soon to be paroled husband. The woman, in fear for her life from her abusive husband, wants Reacher to kill her husband; is she telling Reacher the truth? Part of her story doesn't add up, is there more than meets the eye in Echo?This book does better than most Reacher books in forcing him to uncover clues. I really enjoyed this novel, the way Reacher pieces together the clues allows you to unravel the truth along with Reacher, not before. Pacing of the novel is very good, very few slow spots and the action doesn't feel forced.I have read all 15 Reacher novels, Echo Burning is in the top 5, I highly recommend."
3,Least favorite Reacher Novel so far,This story just started off way too slowly and I just didn't care for the characters as I had in the past. There wasn't a lot of action until the end. Just seemed slow and boring.
3,Child's Weakest...,This was my least favorite Reacher book by a mile...I am shocked it has an average of 4 stars. It is the only one I have only read once and will remain as such.
3,Ok so far except,"I'm only about 250 pages in, and this is my first Lee Child book I've read so I can't give an overall opinion as of yet. However what is starting to annoy me are the very repetitive lines of: ""he said nothing"", ""Reacher said nothing"", ""she said nothing"", etc... I'm serious, it's repeated about 5 times a page, sometimes every other sentence. If the one character continues to speak, and Reacher doesn't respond, I'll assume he didn't say anything. I don't need to be informed of that fact 5 times per conversation. I certainly hope the other books aren't like this (I have 3 more Reacher novels I still need to read). Probably just me but I just find it really annoying."
4,Fun Series,Great easy read. Just started on the Jack Reacher series after the movie! sure that any action junkie will like it.
4,Echo Burning Why I liked it.,"Typcal Reacher, good plot, excellent story line, different setting. Fast movng story about real redneck farmers of the desert, Texas heat, hot lesbian girl and murder incorporated.The sub plot of Reacher helping the poor and downtrodden was exciting. Nothng like pushing a redneck around for the sake of justice.Lee Child has been my favourite mystery author for a long time now."
3,Strictly for Reacher fans,"Jack Reacher gets into trouble with a local sheriff in a small town in Texas. When he plans to quit the town by hitchhiking, Jack is picked up by a beautiful woman with Mexican heritage named Carmen Greer. At the outset, Jack realizes Carmen has an ulterior motive. But what is it? In order to find this out, Jack travels with Carmen to a very sleepy little town in remote Texas named Echo where prejudices run rampant.Lee Child sets his thriller in an America small town. The underlying theme is prejudice. In order to highlight this, he brings in diverse characters who are discriminated, not openly, based on the heritage and also by the choices they make. Because of the setting, this novel stands out in the Reacher series. Even though it is not as colorful as the settings in the other novels, the ruggedness of the terrain adds to the drama in the novel.Strictly for Reacher fans."
2,So so....,"A disappointing 2 stars on this one. I am working my way through the Reacher series, having picked up 7 of them in paperback for nothing at my work library, devouring them, I then set out to fill in the blanks, so some of them I have read out of order. This one I purchased for my Kindle, however, it was very disappointing. It wasn't until about half way through the book that it started to pick up. I think all the heat and red paint and dust was just too much. It probably didn't help that we were in the middle of a heat wave with 35C degree temps. And the first half of the story was quite slow, very un-Reacher like. I was glad when I finished it. Usually Reacher leaves me wanting more, so that says something. On to the next one!"
2,Not one of Child's better ones,"I read this Reacher novel after having read others in the series, and I have to say I did not like it, as it was nowhere near the caliber of the others I'd read (The Enemy, The Affair, Hot Shot). Carmen was not a sympathetic character and I never did feel that much sympathy for her. Reacher seemed tired and the plot wound all over the place. His sidekick Alice, who only appears later in the book, came across as rather flat, too."
2,a slow burner,"This is my first Reacher and to be honest, it was a tough slog through this rambling story. The story never really built and seemed to go along at a snail's pace for me. I realize there are a whole series of Reacher novels, but there was no real character development in this book and no incentive for the reader to try and figure out the storyline - puzzling it out for ourselves that is. I'll probably try another of Child's novels because he seems recommended by a lot of people. But I prefer more thrilling thriller novels - Iles, Lincoln Child, Rollins and others."
2,"Sloppy research, no mystery","I have to say S. Temerlin practically wrote my review for me (see his of 11/12/2006). Child's knowledge of firearms is not even second-hand. Also, the tactics (it pains me to apply the term) Reacher used to defeat the bad guys were sloppy, self-defeating, and would have gotten him and Alice killed except that the ""professional"" killers were even more stupid than Reacher. His wrap up of the major bad guy was from an old Perry Mason TV show. This was my second, and last, Child book."
3,Needs Deoderant,"Ok, I have been reading the Lee Child novels as fast as I could get them... started with Persuader because I got it in the airport. Thought it was a great airplane, vacation read. Found Killing Floor and The Enemy and devoured them in their chronological order and wished I'd read Enemy first. Then bought up to Echo Burning. Finished it today. No complaints other than I kept thinking how attractive can he be in that heat with NO DEODERANT!! PU. But couldn't put it down anyway. Still a great read and I am getting the rest of the books to go with my LEE Child set."
1,Liberal Horse Manure,I was somewhat enjoying these books until now. Child knows nothing about Texas and nothing about our relationship with Hispanics legal and not legal. He should be ashamed at the monster portrayal of the brave men and woman of our border patrol who risk their lives every day protecting our borders.
2,doesn't deserve to be part of the jack reacher series,"I'm working my way through the entire Jack Reacher series and am a huge fan. This one, however, was uninspired.I hate to admit it, but I think the problem was that it was too down to earth. While I can appreciate the sentiment, I like my Jack Reacher reading more in the realm of fantasy. The imperfect characters made them unlikeable. The action was also a bit lacking. Jack himself was a bit hard to take at times. Finally, the Bruce Banner ending sealed the deal - I'd recommend skipping this one."
3,Disappointing,"I didn't like it as much as I have enjoyed other books in the Reacher series. Just an ""ok"" read."
3,ECHO BURNING,This 5th book started off very slow but as the story went on it got better. I didn't like Carmen in-laws at all & they got what they deserved. I liked that Jack helped Carmen get cleared for shooting her husband. My favorite part of the story was when Jack found & saved Ellie. This wasn't my favorite book in this series but it was better than RUNNING BLIND.
3,Who is lying?,"Echo Burning is an interesting mystery set in West Texas. The principal character, Jack Reacher, is a drifter with a past who is drawn into a complex family dynamic. The story is well constructed however I was disappointed with one out of character slip up on the part of Reacher. I don't think it is too much of a spoiler to mention that the Jack Reacher who knows so much about crime scenes would never leave his finger prints on a gun that he suspected might subsequently be used in the commission of a crime. With that exception the actions and motivations of the characters are believable and the suspense maintained.If you like good crime mysteries this one will keep you guessing. Someone is lying but who."
3,Amusing but a poor value.,"As with all Dilbert books, this one is quite funny. It's tiny, however, being only 29 undersized pages long; even if you haven't seen all of these strips before (as you will have if you're an established ""Dilbert"" fan) you won't be getting your money's worth from this little book. If you ARE an established fan, you CERTAINLY won't get your money's worth from 29 undersized pages of reprints quickly repackaged to make a cheap buck."
3,"Good gift book, waste of money otherwise","The biggest dissapointment of this book was how short it was. It had only a few strips. I would have been okay with that if they had been the BEST EVER on that topic, but they were just average. I ended up giving this book to an in-duh-vidual for his retirement party. I didn't like him and didn't particularly want to give him a gift, so this was perfect. But I wouldn't buy this book for myself, and, if I was giving this as a real gift (like a birthday gift for someone I like) I would buy one of the full-length books instead."
4,Exploring Medical Anthropology,"The book came in good condition and I'm enjoying it so far. I'm reading the book for a Medical Anthropology class I'm taking at UCI this quarter. It has good references to the ethnographies that Joralemon has participated in. So far, I'm enjoying the course and the book."
3,Disappointed in the story line.,This story had a lot of potential. It's the type of story that attracts the interest of most people. The movie was well done but I was a little disappointed that so little time was spent on the results of the documentary. I guess I hoped that there was more of a resolution or at least a hint of a resolution. Other than that I enjoyed watching it.
5,not a toy,It's genuine align. The quality is there no slop and replaceable bearing makes this a good deal. I wish I could find bearings for this here because I fly almost every day and things wear.
3,Diminishing returns,"Picked up this reissue last year after not hearing this record for at least 15 years. I remember being very let down when it first came out becuase the first one ""In The Air Tonight"" was so great - perfect blend of MC5/Stooges with a little bit of Beefheart/Mothers.This record is really good but a little more psychedelic and softer in spots. If you're a fan of Soundtrack of Our Lives you'll probably really like this record. If you like the raw sound of the debut you may be a little disappointed. Either way, you should pick it up. It will probably be out of print soon and it's worth having.Fans of gonzo Detroit and NYC stuff should also check out Mighty High...In Drug City."
5,Super beret,Warm beret. Wear it almost weekly. Was afraid to purchse it but I am SO glad thatI did as it is very hard to find beretsat stores any more.
2,Not what I expeted.,"Not what I wanted. I should have researched it better. Mostley my fault, you get what you pay for."
2,Kind-of a Pain,"It kind-of works, but is a major pain. I didn't expect it to take as long as it has - over 3 hours. After doing it over 10 times, the nut inside the screw cap came loose. We jammed it back in with a hammer and superglued it - it came out again. So, it is basically unusable at this point. I am guessing that after you use it 10 times, it just can't handle anymore and starts to break."
2,dingking,"We used this product some 10 years ago and liked it very much. This new one that was ordered does not work at all. The black stick of hot glue does not work, in that it will not adhere correctly. It pops off with the suction cup rather than holding the cup in place to pull the dent out. We have tried it on two items, the refrigerator and the new car. Had to end up taking the car into the garage to the tune of $158.oo to remove the ding. (It was not a crease, only an indention which the garage pushed out from the inside after removing the inside panel."
1,DO NOT BUY product is worthless,"After following the instructions exactly, the product doesn't work when trying to remove any dings. The pull tabs ripped away from the glue before the glue came off the truck, leaving big chunks of the adhesive on the vehicle. Then the next time I tried it, the pull tabs completely broke in half before pulling the adhesive off. Cheap, worthless product, wish I could get a refund."
3,Ding King Dent Repair Kit,"The kit was not so practical mostly because the glue used was not strong enough. Suction method would have done it better.""Amazon Verified Purchase""Good day folks,"
4,Ding King,"For the money the tool is good. Our Collision shop has seen many products like this through the years. They all seem to be just ok, but I would say that the glue with this tool is better... it sticks to the paint much better then most. The key is knowing what dents will come out with this product. It works on small, non sharp crease dents that are not near the edge of a panel. It may take 8 to 10 attemps but eventually the dents get smaller and less noticeable. Very rarely will you get 100% of a dent out with a tool. Either way, it works very good for the money."
1,Doesn't work as described,I purchased this item to remove a small dent. Much less than a grapefruit. I made sure the ambient temperature was within the specified limits and tried to remove this dent over 10 times. Very little to no difference was could be seen. Not happy and would not buy this again.
1,Not worth the money.,We live in a city and we got a minor ding on the side of the car. We bought this kit a few years ago somewhere other than Amazon (think a auto store). Anyway we did what it said and did it several times. It did take some of the ding out but not all of it. We barely got the glue off from it. A few years later we got hit by a suv when we were getting the car fixed we had the guy remove the ding and now it looks perfect. Sadly this thing was not worth the money or effort we put into it. I also watched Fox 5 and they tested the item it didn't work for them either. I know it will cost more but take it to a auto shop and get the ding removed there. Don't buy this product it is worthless.
5,It actually does work,"I sideswiped my garage door pulling out and had significant denting and ruffling over a small area (about a square foot). Because my car is older, I didn't want to have it fixed professionally, but I still wanted it to look presentable. This kit was the perfect solution. I worked on the damage little by little over an afternoon, and I'd say it looks about 90% back to normal. There is some subtle ruffling, but you have to be close and looking at it from an angle. The product was extremely easy to set up and use, and it really does behave exactly as depicted in the commercial. Also, it does not require a lot of upper body strength to turn the knob, so literally anyone can use it."
1,Complete waste of money,"We tried the product for 3 hours hoping to fix a few very small dents, but nothing worked, and it was complete waste of money and time."
1,Not worth it,This kit advertises it can be applied to soft dents. It better be a very soft dent as this product did not work at all for me. The glue appeared to adhere very well to the car but not at all to the pull tab. I am going to try and apply the glue to the dent and forgoe the pull tab system. Possibly using the pair of pliers with the glue may provide some results.
3,Not magical but still improves the ding,This product does fix part of the dings but it is not magical. For 20$ you get what you pay for.
4,Ding King,Arrived as promised. Work well. Cheaper that taking my car to a body shop for MINOR dents.Thank you Ding King and I will recommend your product !!!
3,Mixed results,I tried this product on a dent in my daughter's car and it partially pulled the dent. The weather was hotter than the recommended ideal temperature range but the car was outside and I cannot make the weather here any cooler at this time of year(I wish I could). It might have worked better in cooler temp. I may try again later in the year. Also the dent was near a crease line in the body panel.
1,Bad Experience for a European,"I really don't know if the product works, because I'm unable to use it!!When I received the Item it worked only with 110 Volts, I all european contries we use 220 Volts. When offering, selling and shipping products to Europe, one should expect that the products worked in Europe, but that's not the case.I tried to get a refund, or to return the item on the merchants expence, but they refused. Then I made a complaint to Amazon, but without any result. I have spent 80$ (price and shipping) on a product that's completely useless to me.This is certinly not the way to make people love eTrade!!!!Tor Valen, Denmark"
4,"Mileage varies based on ding, size, placement and luck","I used the ding king kit on several dings and dents. It worked on some like magic, and failed miserable on others. I found for small and curved dings it works fairly well. On dings that are sharp, not so much.I also found that on some dings, it seems to work initially, but the ding re-appears later. This is specially true on dings which have a sharp angle, as opposed to dings or dents which are curved."
2,OK Dent Puller,"I wanted to pull a dent out of my motorcycle fuel tank and it would not pull it. Must have to be a flate surface dent, it didnt work for me. Maybe you will have better luck."
3,Only for minor dents,"It won't work on mild to heavy dents or when it's cold outside, but on bumps without a crease (like if you dent it with your knee or a very blunt object) it's great, even if they are big you can work your way through it."
4,Works -,"There are plently of reviews here so i am just going to add a little more. This does in fact work. The key is to completely cover the pad with glue, and wait for it to completely dry. I waited 10 mins.My guess is that people are not cleaning the surface properly or waiting for the glue to dry. The bad is that this will not produce the same result that a professional body shop can. But for $20 bucks it can take out some ugly dents if you take your time."
2,Glue does not stick!,"I tried this product to remove a small dent in my ford mustang. I followed the directions and did this over 10 times. The glue kept coming off and sticking to the car or the included plastic pully. I called dent king cust ser and they said to try ice to get the surface of the car cool enought to stick, but after 10 tries with very little results I didn't bother. Might work for a larger dent but not for very small dents."
5,Works great! Need patience.,"This kit worked great on the dings on my car from shopping carts being slammed into it's sides. You need patience for the Ding King to work but it does work!!! My car looks 99% better after using the Ding King than before. It does not remove every cease and crevice but it works great on the simple dings. You must do each ding more than once in most cases but the results are well worth it. I would highly recommend this product. Buy this product keeping ""patience"" in mind and you too will be satisfied with the results."
1,Doesn't do a damned thing for my ding,"I've got a small ding on a ridge line, I guess you'd call it, of the car. It's a place where the contour changes. So far I've applied the glue and the smaller of the two buttons about a half dozen times, let it cool each time, and each time have achieve absolutely nothing. The glue doesn't stick solidly enough to the plastic button puller. It breaks away before it pulls out the small depression. I kind of feel ripped off, but at least it was only for $15. Could have been a lot worse."
1,Fail,"The glue gave out way on the wingnut way before the dent could be pulled. I tried half a dozen times on two different dents. If there is any positive it is that the glue was easy to remove from my OEM paint job. I returned the product to the store. It was a complete waste of time,"
4,Works well with a little adjusting,"I bought this after reading online reviews and an ABC affiliate story about how well this product works for the price. I have to say that I completely agree. I had a pretty deep ding (about the size of an orange). I've been working on it this morning and I'm completely surprized by the results. It still needs a little tweaking, but the ding is now the size of a dime. What I found while using this is that there aren't instructions for adjusting the tool for the size and shape of the ding. After doing a little experimenting, and adjusting the tool, it really begun doing the trick. I'm using it to fix a few dings and a car I'm selling and would highly recommend it for that reason."
3,"EZ to use, make sure the car surface isnt too hot",It pulls out dents and dings easily. The only problem I had was a hot black car so the glue didn't stick well until it cooled down.
1,my interest in the Dropkicks ended here,"i enjoyed this band a lot more when their punk to irish folk ratio was 80-20. it seems like with this release, they flipped that ratio to 20-80. i agree with some of the other naysayers that the whole ""irish"" image has gone too far and is just a cheap gimmick now. their working-class pride has been stated ad nauseum too, just like many working-class punk/h.c. bands (agnostic front, madball, blood for blood, etc.), which is kind of amusing since at least half of their audience, if not more, would be considered middle or upper-class. i'll stick with the 1st two LPs..."
3,From pub rock to stadium schlock...,"Disappointed in this one. Too much noise and not enough punk guitars pounding. I'd say to the Murphys: please leave the ""anthems"" up to the Pogues. Get DO OR DIE instead."
2,i grow weary,this cd was my first dkm cd and at the time i loved it. then i got do or die and gang's all here. they made this cd look like the crap that it actually is. the songs are pretty much all the same except for the rocky road to dublin which is good but gets old fast. this cd gets old almost as fast as Flogging Molly did and that is pathetic. it almost seemed that this whole cd were just fillers. In this cd they really make it known that they are irish too but then in Boston who isnt irish. get do or die and gang's all here. if u like the irish music get some Real Mckenzies or Progues. dont succumb to the level of Flogging Molly and this cd.
5,An awesome record!!!,"After a lot of waiting and a line-up change, I was afraid this album would pale in comparison with the other classics the Dropkick Murphys have released. I was dead wrong. This is another great cd that shows the band expanding into a more folk-like sound. It works perfectly and this is the best cd I've heard in a couple of years. This has got to be the best bands in rock and roll, truely great tunes."
3,"Slickly produced, punk-affected mediocrity","I was predisposed to love this record and couldn't. The drumming is real nice and the piper seems pretty capable too. But I don't buy the singer's ""punk"" schtick for a second; its fakery is at best tolerable, at worst grating. Furthermore, the slickness of the production (though probably necessary to distinquish the bleating of one instrument from another) undercuts the working class message, which may not be sincere anyway.But, they're from Boston, so I'll give 'em the extra star."
5,Bagpipes rule,"This cd is awsome, if you like hard rock with bagpipes, this is the band for you. I have been listening to Dropkick Murphys for about two years, it has not left cd rotation.Exellent cd, track 16 is one of the greatest(spicy).I strongly advise buy blackout too. Two of the best cds I have ever got. The Bagpipes rule."
3,Pass me a drink and call me Liam!!,"I know that my friend and colleague Peter Pumkin already reviewed this musical wonder but I must also join in. This is an album you can listen to while sitting in a bar like ""O'mallys"" or just while you drink yourself into a stuper in your own home. Bagpiper Spicy McHaggis has such a strong irish taste I can't tell if that is the Irish Rain hitting me in my face or the last of the Dark Ale dripping from my pint!!The higlight of my day is now the Ice Cream Truck and listening to ""Which side are you on"" and ""Fortunes of War"" and ""The Gauntlet"". The true message that is being sent to the listeners can be heard. These guys have the same message as such true bands as NSync,BSB, Boyz to Men and the original Menudo but they say it in such a more poetic manner. Kudo's to Dropkick and long live these Boy Bands and their message of love and happiness!!"
5,Traditional Irish Meets Punk,Words can't really describe this album. You just have to hear it for yourself. Imagine The Chieftains meet Smash-era Offspring. This album will make you want to storm into the local pub and do the jig.
4,a pesonal fav of theirs,"Personally, as all music is, I think this might be my fav of theirs; although I am really enjoying singed and sealed in blood. This one just contains so many classics; well worth the add to my growing collection."
3,Broken bottles and bagpipes,"This album has been growing on me every time I play it. There's plenty of smiles and boots in arse to go around.The Murphys' version of ""Rocky Road to Dublin"" is worth having alone.Is that a nod to Billy Bragg I detect on ""What Side Are You On""?""Good Rats"" is a catchy if somewhat ridiculous tune, but I'm not about to complain about a guest appearance by Shane MacGowan. I only wish Shane's vocals on ""Wild Rover"" was here instead of being a vinyl only offering (but I guess you have to throw sonic Luddites a bone, too).""The Spicy McHaggis Jig"" is sublimely goofy.Ah, they're doing Boston proud, they are."
5,Some of Boston's BEST Irish Punk!!,"When I first bought this cd, (I was actually looking for the Pouges, but couldn't find them,) it was completely on impulse. I had no idea what the DKM were like, or if they were any good. I just knew I luved Irish punk, and this was apparently Irish punk. So when I got in the car and listened to it, my first thought was ""Oh good god. What on earth have I done??"" I really didn't like it at first... or maybe I just didn't appriciate it. ;-) It is currently one of my fav cds, and it's the best music to listen to when you wanna get revved or pumped-up for something!! It's fast, it's loud, and there are bagpipes!! :-) It might have to grow on you, if you're not already a fan of Irish punk, but once you adopt it into your cd collection, you couldn't live without it. (Rocky Road to Dublin is fantastic!!) Highly highly reccommended."
4,The Murphy's second best album,"The latest effort by Dropkick Murphys doesn't disappoint but it doesn't match Do or Die either. But I don't think its fair to compare the two albums. Mike is gone and the Murphys sound has changed, but they're just as good. Ken Casey has really done a good job producing Sing Loud Sing Proud and after a few listens you'll be singing along because every song is quality."
1,Bad Estes!,"I wish they'd stop selling this plastic garbage under the same name as their actual decent products. These things are two flight turds at best. For the most part a backyard flier meant to capture the imagination of the next generation of model rocketry hobbyists, junk like this does more harm than good. My guarantee; within one pack of motors, both of these will be reduced to a collection of parts, none of which should even try to be recycled."
1,it's all right,I like the bratz dolls but tis one is so pretty.I would buy her but i'm not too impressed by the genie theme.I feel that genie magic is inapropriate for small girls.It is a beautiful doll and sasha is my favorite but i still wouldn't buy this particular one.
5,I actually have the doll,"I actually have the doll and as a Sasha collector this is probably the most B_E_A_U_TI_FUL Sasha since the formal funk collection. Unlike the rest of the dolls sasha's outfit and accesories match(including the brush)and the bindi & flower cant be removed. This Sasha has beautiful make-up and the longest hair ever if I'm not mistaken although I've had the doll for about 2-weeks and eventhough she is hours of fun most of it is brushing her hair because it's always tangled and the twists are always coming out(by themselves).This Sasha is the perfect doll(sort of)**This doll has tatoos on her arms, navel and feet, but I think they are supose to henna so if you feel that is a negative image don't buy this doll."
3,Sasha is okay.,"I got this doll just recently and I mean she is cool. I like her hair but I don't like her long pink skirt. I recommend her to you. I also love the necklace that came with her and the fortune telling lamp thingy. Peace out, Sasha lover"
4,3.5 rules,I bought this book to provide rule to run Fellowship of the White Star RPG. It was in great shape when delivered.
3,"Some good, some not so useful","Overall, WofC has brought out another quality product. There are a lot of drop-ins for adventures, a new fleshed out city as well as some new concepts (ie team tactics) that make the book worthwhile. There is also a fair bit of information that doesn't seem useful or would be to a very select group of users. Overall, the new material is good on it's own as well as sparking new ideas for a DM"
3,"A decent read, not great","Overall this book contains about 50 pages of useful materials. The rest is really just fluff and made for a beggining gamer/DM who needs ideas for their campaigns.I would recomend just buying a low level adventure if your starting out as a DM, and save your money on this book as its quite expensive for what you get.For those who are familiar with the game, there is usefull material in the book on items, treasure charts, etc. Its just a smaller portion of the book.If you have an extra $35 dollars go for it, it not don't worry your not missing much."
2,Doesn't Bring the Climax,"My wife and I tried this a few times, and although it provides a pleasant tickle, it does not have a deep or solid enough throb to bring her to orgasm. She found it more distracting than pleasing, and now it sits unused in a drawer."
3,Kind of weak for my taste,"It's cute and tickles slightly which is good for fore-play and to use on my husband. Other than that though it is very weak and I don't recommend it for people looking for ""maximum"" pleasure. I'm also a very experienced sex toy user so I'm partial to plug-ins like the Eroscillator, which by the way is the only sex toy recommened by Dr Ruth, even Sue Johanson gave it rave reviews. Try the EROSCILLATOR, you won't be sorry."
3,Eh,"I tried using this, like, 3 times before giving up. Sure, it's quiet, but it wasn't strong enough to arouse me, let alone push me over the edge. All 3 times I ended up setting it aside for a different vibrator. It's a good idea but I'd suggest spending your money on something else."
1,Not worth it,"It was very hard to actually feel this on my ""tired, achy muscles"" (or however the description puts it). I could feel it vibrating on my finger, but that's about it. It's a little noisy and awkward. I wouldn't recommend the product."
2,Finger massager,"It is not very powerful. But, i guess for the size it is ok. Not very stimulating, not much ""buzz"". Not satifying at all."
2,Temperamental and overrated,"If you are going to juice fruits, or vegetables that are inflexible and contain a lot of juice (carrots, cucumbers, for example) perhaps you will find the Champion to be adequate. Anyone who wants to do a lot of spinach, kale, parsely,celery, cabbage,or other fibrous vegetables that are fairly flexible will find that the Champion is very inclined to get clogged within about 30 seconds of introducing these vegetables. You will be forced to push and push with the tamper, and probably turn the machine off and open it up, to find a solid green mush clogging the mouth of the machine, the blade and every millimeter of the interior. It is an immovable mass. Water running through it doesn't help to any significant degree. It defeats the idea of producing the least heated juice, as this tendency makes for lukewarm or warm juice.Also, the assembly and cleaning are much more complex than other juicers. No other juicer that I've owned handled greens poorly."
1,FAIL- steaming hot juice,"This is the worst juicer ever. I was making 32 ounces of juice, a mixture of veg, fruit, and leafy greens. I was alternating items and allowing time for the machine to work, as instructed. The ""champion"" took 30 minutes to make that amount of juice! and i had to stop and rinse the machine off to cool it. The juice was literally steaming hot. NOT a hot idea for a raw foodist! The super crappy part is that you cant return used juicers. DO NOT BUY THIS JUICER! I would not even sell it to anyone, it sucks so much that I would feel guilty!"
2,Horrible chorus destroys this song,"""If It Makes You Happy"" starts off on a semi-agreeable note, with a tense, bouncing verse over which Crow sings somewhat hushed and wistful. There's a nice organ that has a kind-of ""Positively 4th St."" feel to it. Not bad, one thinks. Then, without warning, the screeching begins: ""IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPYYYYYYYYYYY!"" The bombast of Crow's voice, much like nails on a chalkboard, kills all good will fostered by the beginning of the song. The fact that the chorus repeats, thus forcing the listener to endure Crow's caterwauling more than once, only adds salt to the wound. Will give 2 stars for the nice organ and tight rhythm section, but the rest is all Sheryl Crow's fault. Brutal!"
4,Outsiders - 'C. Q. Sessions' (Pseudonym) 4 1/2 stars,"Myself, I liked this 2-CD / thirty-four track - box set more so than I did the actual second proper Outsider's lp 'C. Q.' ('68) or even their [often] hard-to-find 'Singles A's And B's' (see my review) box set - for several reasons. 'C. Q. Sessions' has nearly two hours of superb quality demos, out-takes and possibly a few unreleased tracks - or at least a couple of songs that either I didn't recognize or perhaps those specific cuts sounded SO different from the original album version, I mistook them for a completely other song. Couple tunes that are definitely worth mentioning include ""Instrumental Space Demo"", ""1, 2, 3, 4 (Doctor)"" - I'm almost sure I haven't heard this song before, ""It Seems Like Nothing's Gonna Come My Way Today"", both edits of ""Zsarrahh"" and the heartfelt ""I Love Her Still, I Always Will"". Highly recommended."
4,A good value,"A good drum with a solid, authentic sound.Note, though, that the ""strap"" - with which drum hangs from your forearm - is MUCH shorter than in the picture. It's less than 1/8 of the length shown. It's enough, barely, to slip my forearm through, between the side of the drum and the strap.Other than that? As advertised. A very good goatskin drum."
5,dio,Os shows do Dio como sempre sao muito bem elaborados e esse nao poderia ser diferente. E'um excelente cantor!!
2,"I love Dio, but I don't love this.","This DVD starts off good enough, with a great version of King of Rock and Roll, but then it just gets too synthesizer heavy. The rare A Special from the Spetrum video blows this away in terms of heaviness and song selection. Rainbow in the Dark is good as always but where is We Rock and The Mob Rules? Dio's 2003 Evil or Divine DVD is way better than this. The biggest reason to get this would be for the stage show which Dio won an award for. Most bands don't have cool stage shows like this any more. Why wasn't the concert footage of Hungry for Heaven shown rather than the song just being played during the end credits? Look for the import We Rock DVD which includes half of the Special from the Spectrum show and part of another concert from 1983, both with Vivian Campbell on guitar."
3,Worth reading ..,"I liked this book quite a bit, although I was disappointed to find that at least 1/3 of the 'mysteries' were actually logic puzzles. All in all, though, I'd have to recommend it."
5,Excellent mystery puzzles!,Smith's clever mini mysteries kept me entertained for hours. I recommend this book to all amateur logicians. I'm anxious to start his Five Minute Crimebusters.
3,pretty flimsy but does the job,"When this vest arrived it didn't look like the vest in the picture. There were no stripes sown on the back, instead there is a pocket that you could put a piece of reflective material in. When I bought the vest it was on sale and for the price I paid it can't be beat. This is not a 'one size fits all' vest though, I have a larger size (2x) and when I tried on the vest the side seams tore away from the light plastic orange material with almost no pressure applied. If you're heavier and want to use this vest, cut through the elastic on the sides and add in a piece and you will probably be able to use it without breaking it though. It is very affordable compared to most vests that are at least four times as expensive, but the material shows the price. If you're looking for a short-term solution or don't need it very often it fits the bill perfectly, though."
3,"""Squaw before a teepee""?","Whenever I read something that labels our Native women as ""squaws,"" I think whoever wrote it has ""heap little brains"".Edward Curtis made many beautiful pictures of Natives. However, he was also the prototype of today's Photoshoppers, heavily staging and retouching his pictures of Natives. So while his pictures are often beautiful, they should not be taken as photojournalism or documentary. They should just be viewed for their artistic and technical value, I think.But the ""squaw"" writing? It should have been left in the 19th century, not brought into the 21st."
4,good value,"If you are fond of calculating the value of a book by the number of memes you get per dollar, then this book is a good value. However, I wonder if the text hasn't become a bit bloated after 8 editions. There is material covered lightly here that is the subject of entire separate books, yet no indication is given that a superficial treatment is being provided (for example, material from linguistics and decision theory). The material that is provided is generally described well - the explanations are clear and there are sufficient examples to fix concepts."
4,"O.k., but still a few things to wonder about","I bought this hub and am pretty happy as well, but just a couple of things to add:1. The LED's stay on all the time. I'm not sure if it's because I'm using a Mac or if they're just broken, but they seem to serve no functional purpose whatsoever. I'd like to find out about it but...2. This hub isn't even on the Kensington website anymore and the only instructions that came with it were simply how to plug it in. A bit frustrating.3. The extension cable (a really nice addition and one of the reasons I bought it) has a ""Lead warning"" on it, saying that it contains lead which is known in CA to cause birth defects and pregnant women shouldn't handle it. A bit scary and I see no reason why lead should even be in the cable.But on the plus side:4. The adapter is 120-240volts so you can take it with you when you're out of the country.Overall, it works and no problems yet so I guess that's all I ask."
4,Worked well but is starting to fall apart,This is a great little USB hub. It worked very well for me for quite some time and in fact still does work without any problems. The one potential problem is that the plug is starting to pull off the end of the little USB wire that connects the hub to the computer. When it finally does break this thing will be dead. I've had it and used it hard for the past 18mo - 2 years so the failure isn't the end of the world.Even though it is great for portability I've found that I like using it at my desk. Because it comes with an AC adapter it's a great way to handle higher drawl USB devices that often come with a second USB cable that is just for power.
5,no problems here,I have had the pockethub for a few months now. had no problems at all. it is always plugged in with the external power and it hasn't become too hot. always have a flashdrive and mouse connected to it and hasn't showed any slowing.
5,Deliciohshus,"Back in the day of vinyl, the junkie that was me got a 12"" by this lady with several mixes of Revival and another title (..Doesn't Really Matter)and it left me torn over that all too oft used phrase 'timeless classic'!! For reasons beyond the scope of this review, I traded away my vinyl collection, and I now realize twenty somethin' years on what a BIG mistake that was. So I;m glad CD's do have the depth and verstility of vinyl, and I got this one with no regrets - highly desirable music that only improves with age STAT!"
1,"Please don't buy this item, it is not the same as the picture","I've received this item and I was shocked that it is not the same as the picture , the belt has the same model number as described but the buckle and the leather keeper loop are different."
2,returned item,"I bought this for my husband and it was short for the length, compared to other 36"" belts it was only 34"" long. we returned it."
2,wrong product,"dear SirsGood day!Pls note one of the products is not the one i ordered, pls let me know to whom i can contact in order to solve irThanks"
1,NUNCA LLEGO EL PEDIDO A SU DESTINO...FAVOR SOLUCIONAr este inconveniente,EL PEDIDO NUNCA LLEGO A SU DESTINO Y FUE PAGADO POR TARJETA DE CREDITO...SOLUCION A ESTE INCONVENIENTE POR FAVOR :)
5,What Can You Say About a Belt?,This is a solid piece of attire. The Logo is tastefully diminutive. It even holds your pants up. Every component of this product is made with quality. It should last for many years.
2,Plastic Quality,"This belt appeared to be a very cheap quality in reality, it looks and feels more like a plastic rather than leather."
1,JUNK,"BELT LOOKED GREAT WHEN I RECEIVED IT.IT FELL APART AFTER MINIMAL USE.IT LOOKS LIKE TWO THIN STRIPS OF LEATHER ON THE INSIDE AND OUT SIDE, WITH FELT IN THE MIDDLE."
5,Sky Woman and the Beauty of Her Design,"A beautiful array of poetry, writing and art celebratingthe lives of Indigenous women who are not only massaging theearth on Turtle Island but are doing it together!"
5,Finally on CD,"I purchased this album in the sixties, and fell in love with its slow pace full of longings, regrets, admonishments, and just plain living. It was and has remained one of my favorite jazz albums of all time. The delivery of the lyrics makes one live the story while being moved by the music. This kind of musical intimacy has been created by few performers. It just does not get any better with this music essential to any collection of traditional jazz."
4,Very good,"It took me a few listen-throughs, but I really have come to appreciate this album. The title track, ""Analogue,"" would be an excellent candidate for mainstream radio."
4,Amazing record with a couple clunkers...,"This record really surprised me... I have always loved Hunting High & Low but never looked further into their career... Strangely, the first 6 songs could be any band's dream-start to a ""best of""... then there is a song that sounds like a completely different band... ""Over The Treetops"" sounds more like Neil Young or The Jayhawks and throws the cohesive feel off quite a bit... this is then followed by an amazingly bad song, ""Halfway Through The Tour""... but then... back to amazing songs with ""A Fine Blue Line"" & ""Keeper Of The Flame""... then 3 forgettable songs to close it out..."
4,Analogue,A great album. The classic aha sound with a modern twist. They are great songwriters and very innovative and interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Recommended.
4,on the other hand,"Great band, highly underrated. Some tunes are very strong, some on the other hand are weak. But when the tunes are strong, it is as good as it gets"
4,Great Come Back!,Really good album. It's good to see they have evolved musically but maintained the core of who they are. This is a great album for new and old fans alike!
3,Not their best effort....take two steps back.,"Birthright, Holy Ground and Fine Blue Line are the best songs here. Celise and Don't Do Me Any Favors are okay as atmospheric filler. Cozy Prisons is almost good but is basically trite twaddle. Everything else is subpar junk. I thought ""Lifelines"" was better. There needs to be more songs that showcase Morten's incredible range with a few sweet songs in between. Average pop songs don't work because Morten is a unique talent. Flaunt it. ""Over the Treetops"" sounds a lot like ""Oranges and Apple Trees"" from their last CD. No more songs like that....they're really boring. A-ha has such potential, but they need better songs....more DRAMA!"
1,Another awful cd for a-ha. Grade: F-,"The high praise for this cd reminds me of a cult following.Ask yourself this, why is this cd not available in the United States? The reason is becuase this is a hack cd, rotten all the way through.I love a-ha when they produce a solid cd, like MEMS or SOTR, but analogue is shameful, like EOTSWOTM and MB. Wake up people!"
1,"What happened this time??, another ""East of the Sun West of the Moon""???","I was desappointed the same way in 1998 with this ""lapsus"" compliation... I tried to think they did't really launched anything that year..With the exeption of a couple of tracks, all the rest seem to be almos the same rithm, sound and style.....Where they in a hurry to launch the release????Did they record it in the garage???Budget problems?Was it Morten singing??????I am still a fan and have ALL their CD's, even Morten's own discography both in English and Norweigan but.....Definetely, if you want better acoustic music, content, recording quality and singing style you should try Morten's solo album called ""Wild Seed"". Just try the listening link in Amazon...Anyway, I hope they produce a much better album next time..."
5,An album you MUST own,"I have listened to this cd a gazillion times since I bought it. My 12 yr. old even loves it. You can't listen to it without feeling transformed. I especially love to put it on when I am in a bad mood or stressed out. I met Daniel and he is so sweet. If you ever get the chance to see him play, you MUST. Truly one of the most inspiring people I have seen in a long time!!! P.S. My daughter and I just can't get the songs out of our heads. She comes home singing them!"
4,Tai Chi Anyone?,"This practice broad sword is a great choice for just that...practice.It is great for forms. This is my second time buying this sword for ""PRACTICING"" with two at a time. Double Broad-Swords are great for Tai Chi and Kung Fu both. My wife is doing fantastic with this ""Wooden Kung Fu Broad-Sword"" The choice of wood and smooth finish, is excellent. Along with the workmanship. It will break near the hand gaurd if you're not careful."
3,Just don't hit anything with it,Nice looking and well balanced. Good for forms. Just don't hit anything with it. Unlike a bokken it is not designed to hold up under impact. The blade will snap off at the crossguard fairly easily.
3,Good product for price,"This is a good product for the price. Good for training, but tai chi practicioners should be aware that while this is a training sword in the form of a traditional chinese Kung Fu Dao. It is not the same as a tai chi broad sword. However you will still get good training out of it."
4,Only if you have a personal interest.,"I have lots and lots of miles in the back of these things. Penance for blowing your per diem in Anchorage's sin dens is having God's own hangover and riding in the back of one of these things to Bethel or Kotzebue. That infernal racket ending makes you happy to get to places like Bethel or Kotzebue.They were a major part of Alaska's history and lots of us have lots of memories attached to traveling on them. If you're looking for something technical on the 737 Combi, this isn't it. There is a lot of good scenery and familiar faces doing familiar things if you've travelled rural Alaska.For those of you who haven't and buy this, the pictures in this video are the only time I've EVER seen a 737 Combi so clean!"
3,Bondage,"This book showed a great deal of promise and development, but fell rather flat when compared with other novels of its type. The ""eroticism"" isn't all that erotic and the characters were cheaply but somewhat well developed. As a whole, while the book was a decent read, I would have to say that there's a myriad of other books on the subject that are far better written, more suspenseful, and erotic. If you find it cheaply, and have a few hours to kill, this is a great book, but unless it meets those criterea, there's no real need to bother."
5,Kampion Strikes Again,"Drew Kampion was the first great surf journalist, back in the fledgling days of Surfer Magazine. He changed the way we thought about surfing and the things that mattered in Hawaii. This latest work, a remarkable combination of choice photos and intriguing illustrations (by Jeff Peterson) serves as the essential primer for understanding waves. I was particularly struck by some of the photographs -- Terry Wade bodysurfing the Wedge, a three-man outrigger canoe taking on big Hawaii, Mike Parsons on a bomb at Jaws -- and, naturally, by Kampion's clear-headed writing. As he once inscribed, ""Life is a wave. Your attitude is your surfboard. Stay stoked and aim for the light."" -- Bruce Jenkins"
3,"Kampion's ""Waves""","Kampion's ""Waves"" book is good, but not quite what I was looking for. For me, there were too many illustrations instead of photos and some of the photos were grainy, possibly due to over enlargement. This book is somewhat informative, but the information was not extensive enough for me."
5,Beautiful and functional,"This is everything I want for a pastry brush. First of all, the bristles are just right, not too soft or too hard. Other brushes with silicon bristles are too soft to be practical.Another thing I like is that it is easy to clean. It is easier to clean than any of my other brushes. All you need is a little soap and water.Finally, it is pretty to look at. So many cook's tools are ugly and it's nice to have something that looks good."
2,skip it,I bought this because I wanted a basting brush for spreading oil on top of chopped vegetables for grilling but this is a bit useless. It's very easy to clean all the way but it does need a lot of oil in order to coat the food surface properly. I'm not thrilled with the performance of silicon bristles. Spraying the food with nonstick cooking oil would be a better way of doing things. It might work better for basting if you cook with a lot of liquid.
3,"Good Dictionary, Terrible Binding","This dictionary is excellent. I rarely find words which aren't listed, and the definitions including common phrases make finding the correct translation fairly easy. But, as others have stated, the pages started falling out almost immediately. It doesn't seem to be just this dictionary either, as the Russian course I purchased at the same time (Oxford's Take Off In Russian) also has its pages falling out. I hope Oxford does something about this as it really takes away from their otherwise excellent books.Another reviewer stated the dictionary doesn't have the alphabet, but mine definitely includes one as part of the pronunciation guide in the beginning. Russian pronunciation is much more straightforward than English, so pronunciations aren't listed for Russian words.5 stars for content, 1 star for binding."
4,Good,It is a very complete dictionary. It was helpful in a trip. Its shape is easy to take it along with you.
1,Only for someone who can read and write Russian!!!,I am going to Moscow to work and need to learn some basic Russian. This dictionary is absolutely worthless unless you can read and understand Russian. It makes no sense at all to me. I need to first learn Russian and then I can use the dictionary!!!... Not being able to read Russian I cannot pronounce the words in the dictionary. I may as well be looking at Arabic script!!!...It should be clearly stated that this dictionary can only be used by someone who understands the Russian alphabet and knows how to pronounce the words.I now have to try and find something else.I will be sending this back.
3,Does not usually have what I'm looking for,This was supposedly a well rated dictionary. But rarely is the word there when I'm looking for a Russian word.
3,"good, but falls apart","great for occasional use. but ive had it for one day, have only opened and read it once, put it on my dresser and now the back is already coming undone. but the information inside the book is great. only wish the book had better uality."
4,Good resource,"I chose this dictionary based on a recommendation from a course instructor. I haven't used other English-Russian dictionaries and thus cannot compare it to other options. However, I have been using this for about two weeks now. I have found it to be very useful--but keep in mind, this is a ""pocket"" dictionary (not that it fits in one's pocket--it doesn't), but in that it is not meant to be exhaustive."
4,A Real Eye Opener,"I am a student at OSU and I recently read the book for an English class. This book, as referred to in the title, was a real eye opener. Bernstein touches on an array of subjects including factory farming, the value of humans and animals, and animal experimentation. I had no idea that animals were treated so badly in our society. However, the author does a good job in conveying these horrific facts in the book. He also does a good job in his research. From the very beginning, it is obvious that the author did a thorough job in researching and supporting his arguments. The book is very persuasive because the author presents his argument, and immediately addresses the possible counter arguments. With this structure, it is difficult to disagree with his opinions. Overall, the book kept my interest throughout and I would recommend it to anyone who is curious about our relationship with animals."
5,An Exceptional Delight,"Benedict's Dharma is a rare find--a book on spirituality that is lovingly burnished by practice. Benedict's Rule was above all a work for practical application; what few understand is how well the Rule translates into Eastern practice.Rarely have I enjoyed a book as thoroughly as this one; I regretted reaching its final page, for the journey it provided was such a delight. Yet the greater truth is that this book is meant to be a passageway, pointing the way to greater spiritual understanding and greater self-knowledge. The truths it uncovers are applicable to anyone who is serious about leading an authentic spiritual life.This book is an exceptional treasure, offering significant and practical insights on every page."
5,Just a Little Peace Please,"Frank Morgan would rather put up his guns and live in peace, but outlaws have smashed his life, seriously injured his wife, and taken his son. Now he rides into a valley busy with a range war. Fortunately for Frank his reputation has preseeded him. The battle is on and Frank needs to make some quick hard decisions in order to confront all the danger."
5,great gift for my Burmese born Dad,"He loved this book, and still continues to rave about it a few years later. He was born there and grew up there through his teens. To see how much has changed without visiting the country himself was nice. He really enjoyed it, so I'd have to recommend to anybody with an interest."
4,Black metal,"Slechtvalk is an interesting animal.They are, for the most part they are a black metal band. But unlike most in the genre, they sing primarily about war (as can be told by the titles of their last two albums.)Instead of doing what most modern black metal artists do nowadays by adding a horrendous amount of synths and clean vocals, they have opted for a completley different route. In leu of the traditional clean vocals to break up the screaming, they have instead incorporated a more viking chant approach. This creates an interesting atmosphere.It's sad that more people won't check this out due to its unblasphemous nature. But that is their loss. This is a great band that deserves more mainstream blackmetal fans attention."
3,The truth hurts!,"I was disappointed with the set. Everything I had heard from the Goodman band of the mid thirties was smooth, swinging, powerhouse performances. I now know that the other live albums were cherry picked for the best work, duh, of course. When I heard these unedited, ""as heard"" on air takes from the Manhattan Room, I was disappointed with song choices, the amount of vocals and most of all, some songs sounded like they just got the charts as they sat at their stands. Best example is Mary Lou William's, Roll 'Em. Jess Stacy clearly runs out of material for his solo and Goodman makes him take more solo time anyway and then Goodman starts playing and playing and playing one of the longest most un-inspirational solos of his career.There are some great performances here, but over all, I say its only ok."
4,Things aren't always what they seem.,"Back Cover description: Demetri Kastro has dark suspicions about Joanna, the young and very attractive woman who has escorted is father home to Greece. Though the elderly millionaire is ill, Demetri is certain Joanna isn't what the doctor ordered!However, Demetri's attempts to dig beneath Joanna's coolly beautiful exterior reveal few clues as to the nature of her relationship with his father. She's giving nothing away...except an unwitting sexual attractiveness that Demetri finds hard to resist....Well-done story with good sexual tension between Joanna and Demetri. Two subplots thrown in; one about the father's health, and the other about Joanna' ex-husband. Joanna seems to have the upper hand-by that I mean she is not a doormat doing whatever Demetri wants. Her relationship with his father is nicely done and respectful. Try it."
2,Rather Boring,"I found the plot tiresome. Given that Joanna was treated in an inhuman way by her ex-husband, I don't think I understand why she would enter into a deceptive relationship with the old man only to develop the hots for his son. She was misjudged by Demetri but she brought that about through her own agreement to pose as the old man's mistress. I don't know but there was some lack of tact on her part and that of the old man's when he sought to use the very woman he was trying to protect and help to deceive his family. A woman's honour should not only be protected at all times but should also be seen to be protected. For Joanna to go along with the deceitful plot made her as guilty as the old man in dishonouring the honour of womanhood. I did not like the book because Joanna helped to dishonour womanhood. It is one thing to be misjudged and another to give sufficient reason to cause the misjudgement."
5,great,"it was great. just what i wanted and expected. it came very quickly, and was as described. it was packed well and no damage to the box or the items itself."
4,Great 80s pop,"WAM was one of the groups I remember most from my 80s disco days. Wake Me Up before You Go-Go is so upbeat and fun, I can listen over and over. This is a ""must have"" CD for anyone who danced in the 1980s."
5,"""Careless Whisper"" has become an evergreen song","I own this album and it is one of my favorites.Two of the songs (""Like a baby"" and ""Careless Whisper"") are slow ballads, the rest are energetic, rythmic disco songs.All of them are focused on love, not on social justice or religion like some of George Michael's later songs.Buy this CD, the music is damn good."
1,Close but no Cigar,George Michael thinks he can replace Freddie Mercury as frontman for Queen-I don't think so because George is just a copy like Boy George(also fellow gay men)Freddie will always be the original.
1,L-O-U-S-Y,this is an awful album which should be best left behind in the eighties.dated boring dance pop music which you should avoid at all costs.no stars.
1,awful,"please stay far away from this dull,boring 80's pop album.not recommended to fans who like good music like led zeppelin and the doors.minus ten stars."
5,I loved this CD from start to finish!!,"I've always been a big fan of Wham! since I was a young child. I would have given Wham! dozens of awards if I was old enough because ""Careless Whisper"" is the best song ever made."
5,Freedom,"I was in a new mall in colorado with my girl friend. We were walking and the song ""freedom"" came on. I could not believe it, I had not heard this song in about 15 years. (i'm 34, my girlfriend is 29) She thought I was nuts because I was singing it. It all came back to me. It made me feel like a kid again."
4,Made it big.,"After liking Wham for about, oh 20 years now, I thought I'd get some. I was gonna get the import ""best of"", then realized the songs I wanted were all on here anyway, minus ""Last Christmas"". There's not many albums that offer half the songs as hits. Only ""Thriller"", ""Purple Rain"", and George's own ""Faith"" come to mind. I still think George is underrated as a writer and musician. Anyway, this album gives us ""Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"" and ""Careless Whisper"" as the huge hits, and ""Everything She Wants"" and ""Freedom"" as well, which are my two faves. The other four tracks are still good, just not hit-caliber like those four. The only complaint I have is ""Make It Big"" needs remastering badly, and there really should be a U.S. ""Hits"" disc. Still, this is the 80's at its best, though some might say worst. It's a must for me anyway."
4,Classic Wham! Sony needs to remaster this,"I've always loved Wham's music regardless of the negative stigma they get. This album is 8 tracks of pure 80's greatness.However, the ""Make It Big"" cd that is out is the same cd that was released in 1984, making it 21 years old at this point. Sony really needs to remaster this. The audio for this cd is perhaps the worst in my 1000+ collection. I'd love to see an ""expanded and remastered"" version."
4,No competition,"Wham! had a sound all their own, and even though many may classify it as 'bubble-gum pop', the music has become classic for its time--still a lot better than a lot of fluff that was out then, or even now. Whenever I hear these songs, I will always remember the happy times I was having when these songs were at the top. Anyone who thinks George Michael would even think of trying to replace Freddie Mercury has totally missed the point. No one can replace him. And anyone who would assume any connection or rivalry between the two (or with Boy George or anyone else, for that matter) is a misguided idiot!"
5,beautifully executed,"make no bones about it passengers, George M. knew how to write a pop tune. These songs kick out the jams in such a rollicking fashion, most notably on freedom,that even the most world weary weezer fan will be jumping out of their respective closets. choose life! choose Wham!"
5,Enjoy What You Do!,"I dig Wham! and George Michael's sexuality is none of my business. He does have a great voice and is a serious musician and songwriter. This will always be one of my favorite records for the music and the memories. I enjoy all the songs not just the ones that got radio play. ""If You Were There"" and ""Like a Baby"" are two awesome songs. Of course ""Careless Whisper"" and ""Everything She Wants"" are classics to be forever cherished. I have this meter for knowing whether or not music is good, my spine. If I get tingles, it's good. As you can guess, I give this 5 stars on the tingle scale. Enjoy life mis amigos!"
5,Helen's finest,"Simply put, Miss Forrest was in her musical prime here, backed by an amazing jazz trio featuring legendary pianist hank Jones. Fine performances and Helen sounds 30 years younger then she was on these exciting and creative performances. it isd refreshing to hear her sing these songs without the overbearing annoying big bands, and the sappy strings, just Helen her emotion filled voiuce and piano, bass and drums. AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Different and good,"I wanted to get some Anasazi beans but they were unavailable so I decided to try the Chana Dal Beans. They are tiny dried beans (about triple the size of lentils) and took longer to cook than the directions indicated. They make a really nice hummus, which I think is far superior to using chickpeas."
3,not as good as expected,"I have used better dough relaxers than this. The only way to have this work at all is to use considerably more than recommended, and even then you need to let your dough rest for several minutes in order for it not to ""fight back"". I was looking for something less expensive than the dough relaxer sold elsewhere. I guess you get what you pay for !"
3,Strange taste,"Really not what I expected. I think the asorbic acid in it over powers the dough taste; so you get a sour/acidic taste. Next time I will try to use alot less than the required amount according to the label direction (which says 1-2 teaspoon per loaf. A loaf size varies). However, I like how it relaxes the dough and allows it to be used easily."
5,More Like 4 1/2,"This is a VERY good recording for the price and a good intro to Sibelius's music, its really good quality and its the Berlin Philharmonic, for eight buck, what more do you want??I also reccomend Goreki Symphony 3 on this series, also an awesome performance!!"
5,This Is Where It All Began ...,"Plenty of people dismissed The Monkees as nothing more than Pre-Fab Four fakes, but this, their first album, is much better than could ever have been expected. Sure, it's pre-teen geared pop, but what pop! ""Last Train to Clarksville,"" ""Take a Giant Step,"" ""Saturday's Child"" have stood the test of time. And then there are Mike Nesmith's compositions, ""Papa Gene's Blues"" and ""Sweet Young Thing,"" which probably didn't create country rock, but certainly brought the infant genre to the masses. And this reissue has plenty of bonus tracks to further your listening experience. The perfect 1960s pop package."
4,A Monkeemaniac's Dream Come True,"This deluxe edition is a first class reissue of the debut album. Everything from packaging and liner notes to track inclusion and sound quality is first rate, making this the definitive CD edition.That having been said, I would recommend this more to a devoted Monkeemaniac. If you are a casual Monkees fan, seek out the previous single-disc remaster from Rhino. Both are good in terms of quality, but the deluxe edition is targeted to Monkee devotees."
3,Mirror-Image Monkees Offering,"This one is a mixed bag: on one hand it's great to have this collection of songs (my main reason for buying it was the song called ""Laugh"" [originally done by The Tokens], a delightful little piece of fluff that is so typically 1960s); on the other, it's a bit pricey - not only for someone interested in only one or two otherwise unavailable tracks but also because it is a 2-CD set that is essentially mirror-image redundant, i.e., both CDs contain the same tracks - the only difference being that one is in mono and the other in stereo. I didn't realize this until after I received the set. Also, the stereo remasters/mixes are a bit harsh soundwise (something I've noticed with many re-releases of classic tunes).Still, if you love The Monkees and want a CD that contains a lot of their material on one recording - and don't mind paying what to me is a slightly exhorbitant price considering the inclusion of the IMO unnecessary mono disc - I can recommend it."
4,Familiar territory,"If you're a gay man, and especially if you're a gay man living in Sydney, you will recognise the types of characters and situations that Graeme writes about. Strangely familiar and lots of fun."
2,"ridiculously simple, plenty of page ""filler""","This book has some good information, but most of it is so ridiculously simple, that it can easily be ignored. Only buy this book if you know nothing about computers. The book spends about 10 pages discussing how to save a Word Document as a text file. This includes pictures of the ""File Menu"" and pictures of clicking on ""Save As"". Another ""on-point"" section discusses how to use the ""Copy"" and ""Paste"" commands.As I stated, only buy this book if you are computer illiterate."
3,Outdated,"This book is very useful if you know nothing about computers. However for the rest of us, this book is useless and outdated. Even the screenshots in this book are from Windows 95. Feel free to check it out in your local library but I don't recommend buying it. (No, it's not even for a penny)"
4,Funny man,Although Brad can be a bit loud he hits on a lot of the christian and non christian opinions. He is very verbal in his opinions and makes it funny and still clean.
1,Paper Pro stapler,"I HAD this, and never lasted a full year - split in half where you insert the staples. I originally purchased this after having major shoulder surgery and needed something like this to help me at work when I returned. Worked well initially, but really thought it should have lasted more than ten months! Would not recommend!"
1,Jammed Thing!,"I've NEVER had a stapler that jams as bad as this. I HATE it. What a terrible waste of money. As forgetful as I am, I'll always remember to NEVER buy a PaperPro stapler again!"
1,Worst stapler ever!,"This stapler never worked out of the packaging. Basically a waste of money. The staple feed mechanism is terrible, it always spits out 2 staples at a time that tangle up and jam the stapler. Don't be fooled by the fancy blue color!"
3,"Works, but doesn't hold full clip of staples","I've got one of these. It works fine, but I have to break the standard sized clips of office staples in half because it won't take a full clip. This means I am forever digging around for my box of staples and shuffling through it to find the broken half clips and use them rather than break another. I'd like to see less fancy and more function: It's as big as a full sized stapler, for cryin out loud, why not make it take a full sized clip?"
5,Awesome,Already bought the 2nd one to give as a gift. You can staple a stack of papers with the pressure of a finger.
2,Stops Working After 6 Months,"I bought this stapler in April, and by the end of September, it had stopped working properly (doesn't close the staple, leaves an open, jagged staple on the back of the page, etc.).I know that manufacturers (of computers, American cars, etc.) make products that need to be repaired and replaced frequently, but I didn't know that this trend had trickled down to the lowly stapler. I will not be choosing this brand for my replacement."
5,"Best stapler I've ever, ever used","I don't know why, but staplers don't last long in my office. It's not like I even use them that often, but every stapler I've bought lasts about a year or so during which time I use it maybe a few dozen times, and then it starts jamming and eventually ends up in the trash, at which point I start the cycle over.Until this one. This stapler doesn't wow me with its construction quality. It doesn't feel very sturdy. But it never jams, it always handles whatever I throw at it, and I've stopped replacing staplers. It doesn't get daily use, so I can't speak to how well it holds up in that environment, but it's definitely the most reliable and powerful stapler I've ever had."
2,"Great when it works, but doesn't last long","I have had four PaperPro staplers (three different models). These are wonderful when they work. But all of them have lasted only a few months of very light usage. I thought the first one was a lemon and bought another because it was such a great stapler when it did work. But the others haven't lasted long either. I went and bought their staples, thinking it may be a staple problem, but that didn't work either.Its frustrating because I REALLY love the stapler when it works. But after paying a lot of money for three different models only to have all of them die quickly, I'm done with Paper Pro staplers. Theyy're a heartbreak waiting to happen."
2,Nice as long as it lasted,"Unlike the 1 star reviewers, mine lasted nearly a year before it started jamming. It usually spits out the staple when fully opened (wear your safety glasses!), but in the last couple months it has gotten worse, and now it jams more often than stapling. Yesterday the staples started getting stuck in it.I really liked the way it worked as long as it worked, but for its price, it shouldn't be considered a disposable item, and I won't be buying another. Until I find an ergonimc replacement, I'll be using the 50's era Swingline Cub I inherited from my Father."
2,Love it for as long as it lasts,"I don't disagree with the glowing reviews about this stapler. It's fabulous, as long as you realize it's disposable. I'm on my fifth. The clever mechanism that creates so much force gives out in 3-6 months of daily use (I refill about every other week--how many staples is that?). I've tried contacting the manufacturer a few times, but I've never received a response.Since nothing out there compares, and I have keyboard-wrecked wrists, I keep buying them. After a few days wrestling with an old-fashioned stapler, I'm usually happy, or at least resigned, to paying for a new one."
4,worthy new technology,"These new staplers are great. Several companies have versions of them. I have one made by PaperPro (the one Im reviewing) and similar ones from Staples and Swingline. These new style staplers have some kind of slingshot mechanism that drives the staple through like a hammer (not just push it in). I have not had a mechanical failure yet in about 8 months of daily use of the PaperPro, but that is my main concern with this new stapling mechanism. Staplers with this new mechanism are all so much better than conventional staplers. I am always pushing the limit of how many sheets you can staple together without getting a mangled staple that has to be removed or that jams the stapler. I'd say I have 80% less misfires than with expensive traditional staplers."
5,This show is simply brilliant!!!,I just wonder why the Brits can buy Seasons 3 and 4 on Amazon.UK and we can't?! They are on Season 5 and we are still lagging behind!!I'd think that in 2006 someone would figure a way for a Yank to buy a DVD from the UK and be able to watch it. This show is just too well written to hide it! We want our FBW's!!!!!!
2,It seems only trash likes trash.,"This is such a repulsive show, I do not know why it gets so many four and five star reviews, I can only conclude that Amazon customers are morally bankrupt."
5,Footballers Wives 2nd Season,As I stated before I love this series and when available I will order the rest. I have also let other family members watch the Footballers Wives and they love them too.
4,Really good show,"I would say that this show even though it is British, it is quite entertaining. It's like a mixture of Desperate Housewives and Grey's Anatomy. The only bad thing about this show is that if you're not British at times it can get a little difficult to understand"
3,An Accurate Reveiw,"This item is obviously only a set of the first three series of unfortunate events books. The name of book twelve is The Penultimate Peril, as now most of you probaly know. Presumably,the name of the last book (the thirteenth book) according to amazon.com is Called ""the end"". At the end of the penultimate Peril, the bauldelars go with count olaf on a boat from the last safe place that count olaf had just burned down, AND thrown in the Myudoid Mycelium (see book 11 ""The Grim Grotto"")where everey on the bauldilars had ever known in these books. this is not a made up reveiw!"
5,Great Deal,"This is easy to put together and take down. It has a nice bassinet feature for younger babies and even a basic mobile. Great for travel or for spending the night with grandparents, who won't be too put off by any ""complex baby gear."" It's a little heavy once its been put in its bag, but hardly worth mentioning. It's not heavy at all when assembled. It has wheels for easy moving. Don't bother spending an extra $100 on other brands or models for more bells & whistles, unless you're one of those frivolous types with expendable income. Not me! I love my $60 Pack n Play!"
5,GREAT!!!,"This is a great play pen!! No need for those fancy ones that cost twice as much!!! Very durable, GREAT!!!"
3,Fair,"There were some cute and simple quilts in this book that I liked, but I was a little disappointed in a few factors. First, the way the instructions are written did not necessarily allow for easy translation to other fabrics. Many of the featured quilts got their personality from unique novelty fabric; without use of an equivalently novel fabric, they would have little to recommend them.Second, the author made several of her quilts using scraps of as many as several dozen different types of fabric per project. No total yardage amounts were given and the numbers were not written in such a way that one could easily do the math and figure out how much yardage to buy to complete the project without lots of compatible fabrics already on hand.I much preferredBaby Wraps: Quick, Cuddly Quilts (That Patchwork Place)andQuilts, Bibs, Blankies...Oh My!: Create Your Own Cute & Cuddly Nurseryfor their creativity and flexibility."
5,Elegant and dressy.,This is a beautiful and elegant dress watch that looks like an expensive designer watch. It is perfect for the daytime or evening. I like the brushed stainless steel band and the square dial with Roman numerals. I bought the men's watch for my husband on our anniversary. I liked his watch so much that I bought the matching ladies watch a week later.
4,Very enjoyable,A lot of fun if you enjoy good 'ol boy southern humor. This is about a family trying everything it can to survive and bringing the audience along for a fun ride.
1,blows,she should just stick to singing and i couldnt wait for the movie to be over ARGH and that's about it.
3,Who recorded it?,"I bought this because the one review was so strong. There is no indication anywhere on the CD or its liner who the musicians are and where it was recorded. The instruments do not sound very traditional. I even think I heard a zylophone in the mix. If this is supposed to be some kind of electronic version of Native American music, then the description should have said so."
3,is this the right picture?,"The picture shown is one model less, this is not the 980, it looks like 900.If this picture not the actual product, it should have been specified. The right picture will make this item sell at such price. otherwise this would be the 900 series and should be around $10-20 only, there is a big difference in configuration and application between the 900 and 980 AGP graphics adapters.I could have purchased this product, but my doubt about if it is really 980 made me not buy. sorry."
2,Unhappy with darker toasting preference,"Bought this toaster 4 months ago. Chose it for the longer slots, which we use and need. Replaced an older model kitchenaid that I couldn't find anymore. I like my toast very lightly toasted and this toaster does just fine for that. My husband likes his toast much more toasted. It fails at that. It burns the entire perimeter of any style or type of bread and leaves the center fairly untoasted. I'm tired of the smell of burning toast as he tries in vain to get the center to a color he likes. One other complaint: you can't clean the crumbs out, like on my old toaster"
3,Good but died too young,This worked ok and was great for longer baguettes and easy to clean with the pull out crumb tray. But it died after about 1.5 years of moderate (not even daily) use in a 2 person household. We're looking for similar format but a different manufacturer. Pricey for the performance.
2,Very disappointed for the price....,"I ordered this item as it was listed as a ""best of"" in the Baker's Catelague. The only feature that I like is the toast one side (bagel) setting. I would have been just as happy with a Black/Decker $20 toaster."
4,Verve Remixes Classic Cuts !!,"This disc has some really uptempo mixes on here. The spin begins with ""Manteca"" Funky Low lives Remix a piece with a big band feel to it made famous by Dizzy Gillespie. There is also, Nina Simone's famous ""Sinnerman"" on display for the ears. A cool rendition of ""Brother Where are You?"", One of my particular favorites on this disc is ""Slap that Bass"" an early Ella Fitzgearald song. They included another favorite of mine, Cal Tjader's ""Soul Sauce"". I love the longer version, here. Many songs do have that techno feel to them, but it can be extra cool at party time in the den and at the local hotspot. DJ Spinna's Remix of Betty Carters's, ""Naima's Love Song"" is saucey to say the least, just like the remix of ""Whatever Lola Wants,"" is. I'm gonna stop here with Ramsey Lewis's ""Do What Cha Wanna"" Remix By Mr. Lewis himself,hmmmmmm..... Because I want you get this disc it's that good. Not bad Verve, not bad at all. Yeah, it's good to the ear hole."
5,GREAT BUDGET COMPILATION CD IN A SERIES,"I HAVE A FEW OF THE ""VERVE UNMIXED"" CDS IN MY LIBRARY, THEY ARE ALL GREAT BUDGET PRICED COMPILATION CDS OF SOME OF VERVE RECORDS' GREATEST JAZZ RECORDINGS FROMT HE 1960'S. IF YOU LIKE JAZZ, YOU WILL GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH WITH ANY OF THESE CD'S."
1,Do not purchase this fan!,We purchased this fan and it is terrible. It rattles and whistles and is not quiet at all!We use ours in our bedrom at night and the sounds it makes are as annoying as a leaky faucet.Save your money!
2,Junk,"I had this same fan under the Holmes brand and wore it out over a couple years. I bought the Bionaire to replace it because I like it so much. I had the fan shipped to my office and promptly unpacked and assembled it. That evening I took it home and plugged it in. The fan vibrates and squeaks horribly. On low it sounds like a chicken clucking - no lie. Some bearing or bushing is bad inside. It is now in the trash because I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it. If you get a good one, it should be a great fan. Just don't throw away the box and packaging until you put it through it's paces."
2,Qut working,"I bought this fan or one exactly like it by Bionaire 6 years ago, it worked good for 4 years, the 5th year, it made funny noises, so i would not sleep with it, the 6th year, it works for about one minute, then stops. My fans have always lasted longer than SIX years. Would not buy this brand again."
2,worked for a while (2 years) but Now makes HORRIBLE noise,"I am about 10 feet from the fan, it is not powerful.after 2 years of using it, it makes a HORRIBLE noise. not due to dirt or dust. just makes noise. not good for long term.not very powerful."
1,Squeaking and clanking,"I used this fan for about three months, at which point it started making this loud and incredibly annoying squeaking/clanking sound. It looks great, but for the price it should last longer than 3 months of use."
1,No wonder it's out of publication!!,This book did not give information it advertised and can see why it is no longer being published. I do not recommend this silly book.
5,Great book but a few errors.,"I taught myself from this book my senior year in high school and I absolutely loved it.ProsThe cost is amazing.After a solid introduction to Topology (I read Munkres for this which seems to be the standard), this book gives a natural continuation on the subject. Willard really does motivate the subject and gives very detailed proofs. He covers the subject very well, provides excellent exercises and organizes the chapters very well.ConsThere are a few errors, for example, in the way subbases are defined, but this is of little consequence."
2,Very terse,"I found this book very terse. It seems like it could be a great book for someone already familar with topology, I don't recremend it for anyone who is not very familar with the subject. It lacks examples of how to solve problems, then throws quite complicated ones at you very quickly. A few mistakes in printing also."
5,Fun truck for toddlers,"My 18-month-old son loves that book ""The Happy Man and His Dump Truck"", so we wanted to get him his own dump truck to play with. Now it's one of his favorite toys. It's sturdy enough for a toddler but light enough to roll easily. It comes with a man and woman inside the cab that he can take out and play with separately. The truck is also nice and big so it doesn't get lost under the sofa."
3,Could be better,"It does look like durable toy, but I had expected something more impressive for $15. I actually ran in the store for comparable trucks at around $10."
4,"Nothing special, it does what it should do","Like the title says, it does what it should do. This one is heavy duty and does not bend and contort like some others. My only criticism would be that the clamping action drags a threaded rod through the frame and the threads tend to get hung up on the frame making the action less than smooth. It doesn't help if your hands are oily since there is no easy way to grip the frame. But aside from the ergonomics it gets the job done."
2,just not what i needed,This tile saw may be usefull for small applications but I found that it was just not sufficiant for cutting multiple 12 inch tiles. I ended up getting an mk660 off amazon that worked wonders. Check it out it's an awesome tile saw.
1,Jane have no talent at all in writings Books should not write books,one think about poor jane I thing she should looked for another profession she should not write books that not one your talent She is sadly bad author .if you happent have sleep disorder her Book wil help .
4,sturdy manual card shuffler,"Arrived very quickly. Easy to use. Built to last for years and years. Operates quietly and thoroughly. I have been around plastic electric ones and they are noisy, slow and poorly built. This one is the real thing."
3,"Been there, done that.","Married with children was a phenomenon when it came out. It was the anti-June cleaver that we had always wanted. As the program evolved, sex and innuendo became the overwhelming theme of the show. The males were hopeless sexually unattractive losers while the women ranged from hot (Peg) to real hot (Marci) to nuclear hot (Kelly). THe show had some odd plots as it entered its ninth season. You have to have seen them to note the oddities. I won't dwell on them because it would take a long description to break down even one show. Suffice it to say, if you are a parttime fan of the show, get the earlier years, say 2-7. If you're a big fan that wants it all, then go ahead and ante up. If you're no fan, then why are you still reading this?"
3,Married ... With Children Season 9,"This is where the series establishes itself as silly. Still classic, but not the best. Great to see Jefferson come into his comedic form starting here."
4,Bought this for my boyfriend.,I bought this for my boyfriend. It's a nice throwback to the era and still gets the laughs that you just can't believe that they SAID THAT! Better on DVD!
1,Incomplete-nothing there,The only thing in this book is a brief bio of Joyce Kilmer and the names of the poems that should be included. That's all there is. Evidently the poems were inadvertently left out.
3,Not really an anthology,"While full of great songs, this is a bit deceptive as it is not really a true anthology. The first disc is ""greatest hits' (sort of) but the second is a rerelease of his first album in its entirety. Might be happier with The Best of....."
3,painting today?,This book can not be called a owerview of painting today. With mainly photos and lacking in words it creates a posibble line of todays painting. Its value though is mainly in reproductions whicha are of finest quality.
2,Triumph of what?,"This volume presents a few great paintings.But, ONLY A FEW.So, how do we justify the Grand Title, ""Triumph Of Painting""?"
4,Great book on new painting - some are missing,I enjoyed this great book on painting. It misses a few greats like Neo Rauch but overall it's well worth the purchase.
3,"Yummy, but tiny","The taste is very good, but the peanut is barely noticable. The texture is very chewy, not the sawdust-texture found in many protein bars. If they were only bigger, I'd rate them higher."
2,JCParis,"This version of the wonderful masterpiece ""Senso"" is a huge deceit, incomprehensible from The Criterion Collection. What happened? Why these ugly colors? Why to try to ""cook"" the colors? Not to recommend. Buy the european ""Studio Canal"" version..."
1,save your $$$$$$,Out-of-focus......anemic colour.......flatter than Holland.........all of which makes this a very painful experience.......Visconti should rise from his grave and strike dead those who produced this dvd.
3,strange romance,"The Italian version is the one to see in this collection...the Americanized version The Wanton Contessa is B-movie fare, and a horribly edited version at that.Visconti's scenography in Senso is probably more interesting than the romance between Farley Granger and Alida Valli, which never seems to exude raw passion. With all those Italian men at her disposal, she falls for an Austrian soldier, who is about as vapid and uninspired a male lover as you could imagine. Her betrayal of the Italian independence movement for this cold shoulder lover belies believability. As a result, Valli's character plummets into a kind of neurotic grasping for some meaning, and is not only undone, but totally humiliated. It's odd because she never falls back on her pedigree to get her through it, and in the end, succumbs to a petty revenge that finishes off this love affair at the hands of a firing squad. She's a Chekhovian aristocrat in a melodrama of neurotic passion that has more fire than heat."
3,Story let's me down,"After reading critical praise for ths film, I was left a little flat by the story. I had trouble buying into the premise that the woman would so willingly throw herself into bed with the dashing soldier. I guess I wanted more build up to justify the woman's actions throughout the film.Aside from that, the DVD, the packaging, and extras were terrific. The performances by the actors/actresses were top rate. Farley Granger plays the dashiung soldier just right. Alida Valli is terrific as the countess."
5,glorious!,Nothing more to add about this extraordinary restoration. Perhaps should be released as a 2 disc edition because the extra material is so many that the player takes its time to read the disc.
4,The Wanton Countess,"1866 Venice. The Italians are organized to reclaim the province from the Austrian empire. Such is the backdrop for this melodrama. The strength of this film is not in the 'love affair' plot, but in Visconti's operatic direction and unsurpassed ability to recreate history. The undertone is decidedly bittersweet because a way of life, with its beauty, elegance and decadence, is absorbed by history with the birth of a new nation.(An aside, the U.S. audience is viewing an edited version; most films play better when released in accordance to the artist's vision)."
5,SIMPLY GLORIOUS!,"Typically superb package from Criterion for Visconti's peerless Italian classic... Operatic in its melodramatic construction, sumptiously filmed, and vividly acted, it features the director at the height of his powers, which would reach the pinnacle of their achievement in period mode with THE LEOPARD/IL GATTOPARDO... Includes the new restoration of the Italian original, a rarely seen English language version - THE WANTON COUNTESS, and several very salient documentaries as extras, most notably MAN OF THREE WORLDS: LUCHINO VISCONTI from the BBC in 1966..."
4,Luchini Visconti's Senso,"An very fine film, with beautiful cinematography, staging, production design and acting. I suggest people interested in this film also watch the documentary by Martin Scorcese on postwar Italian cinema, My Voyage to Italy, for an excellent appreciation of this film. However the film exceeds Scorcese's appreciation of it.My Voyage to Italy"
4,Good to help teach your child basic japanese.,"I like the format of this picture dictionary. Good selection of basic vocabulary across many familiar topics, but it could benefit from the addition of Romaji(for those who can't read japanese) and hiragana (for those with more aspiration to learn japanese)where appropriate."
3,"Slow, meditative and relaxing music","When selecting a CD for Tai Chi, one might be seeking music to be played along with their Tai Chi practice which has specific movements and motions. That music is more specific and not usually as slow and meditative as this CD. So for practice accompaniment, this may not be the best choice. But, for slow, meditative and relaxing music (their words on the CD insert), this is good."
3,For Completists Only,"As a huge Richard Thompson fan, I went into this soundtrack album with high expectations. However, there is little on this album to warrant repeated listens. While Thompson is one of the most gifted guitarists in any genre, he finds himself restricted by the limitations of composing soundtrack music.By its very nature, soundtrack music should enhance but not detract from the visual. As such, when only listening to the nearly sixty minutes of instrumental music (there is one vocal from cowboy singer Don Edwards on ""Coyotes""), there is little here that is memorable. Whether he's playing acoustic or electric, the 17 songs Thompson wrote specifically for this soundtrack are too laid back to really hook the listener. They are pleasant enough mood pieces, but nothing really catches fire.If you must own a Richard Thompson instrumental album, you're better off with his collection of jigs and reels on 1981's STRICT TEMPO. The GRIZZLY MAN soundtrack is for completists only."
4,Great Movie,"Great Movie... a documentary on a troubled psyche and human nature, with meat eating Bears as a context. This is a story of a man with very good intentions, but his efforts are over shadowed by his personal struggle to define himself. Basically, a lover of nature preservation and bears, goes out to film bears in thier natural habitat for 13 seasons... in the fashion of Jane Goodall and her gorrillas. But unlike Mrs. Goodall, the film maker is no scientist and gets in over his head... in fact, he loses his head and is eaten by his ""beloved"" bears who had had enough of his intrusions."
2,Great movie but........,"I really loved this movie. I also really enjoyed the soundtrack during the film. It greatly enhanced the whole experience.It's also nice to have certain moments in the film come back to you while your listening to this CD. However, I have to say this music does not hold up so well on it's own. I guess it's a little on the boring side. I'm still glad I bought it but it's a little too boring for me most days. I have to be in the right mood to listen to this. The special features in the DVD has an interesting segment on the making of this music. Which will change how you hear the music after you see it.I give this CD 2 1/2 stars"
4,This soundtrack is the spirit of this movie...,When I listen to this soundtrack I'm taken back to the Alaskan landscape where a cooky man fought for the survival of the Grizzly Bears.
3,Excellent soundtrack music...but still soundtrack music,"When I go this disc, I had to make a long errand in my car which gave me a great opportunity to listen to it. The music of the Grizzly Man soundtrack was great in the movie, contributing to the movie experience but not overwhelming it. And ""not overwhelming"" is a good way to describe the music on its own. I don't mean that in a negative way. It's just that there is nothing here that really grabs you in. It's a pleasant, atmospheric listening experience, and there's a place in the world for pleasant, atmospheric music, especially when it us played by Richard Thompson and some excellent supporting musos."
3,"Brilliant in the Movie, So-so standing alone.","Richard Thompson and the other musicians did a great job of creating this soundtrack to go along with Werner Herzog's movie. If you want to appreciate it, watch the movie. When it is not accompanying the movie, it seems a little disjointedly moody and ambient, and doesn't seem to play well track to track.There are some gems on the album, the main title track is great and Coyotes is a great cowboy classic, but the brilliance of the soundtrack was when it was joined to the film. Perhaps the best thing to do is buy a couple of tracks through itunes and skip buying the album.Again, brilliant work for its intended use, not so great on its own. Also, if you get a chance, watch the music featurette on the Grizzly Man DVD. It's interesting, especially if you are a Richard Thompson fan."
1,Absolutely Terrible!!,"I bought the entire set (corner, table and bench) and had nonstop problems with the whole thing. First was the bench. It had a big crack down the middle, not enough to split it, just enough to look terrible. Next I attempted to put the table together. The wood on one of the legs was split down the middle making it unusable. I was directed to the manufacturer, and I could not speak to anyone directly, I was only able leave a message. After 6 tries, I actually spoke to someone who was rude and reluctant to replace the piece. When I finally got the new piece, it was the wrong one. I wanted a refund but was persuaded to try a replacement table. I then opened the corner unit and discovered it was filled with nicks, chips and cracks. This time I wanted my money back! The time I wasted was very frustrating. I strongly recommend not buying this piece of garbage."
4,A straightforward book for organizational development professionals,"This simple book introduces the profession of organization development. It is written so clearly that a relative novice could probably read it and set up shop as an organizational development consultant (or at least know how to hire a good one). Gary N. McLean explains everything and does not unnecessarily complicate straightforward steps. In fact, some steps may be more complex than he makes them seem - although he does caution companies that organizational development may require outside expertise. getAbstract finds that his book will be most useful to those considering working in organizational-development consulting, or to managers who are new to the field."
4,"A fun, overlooked band.","I still own my vinyl copy and was glad to find this CD so I could play it instead. First stumbled on to this group at a friend's house, long ago. While the record as a whole may not be perfect, Cafe Jacques did songs that were outside the spectrum of what radio was playing at the time. And they did them well. Highlights: ""Meaningless"" - their cover of ""Ain't No Love In The Heart Of The City"" - and the beautiful ""Sands Of Singapore."" Maybe it was the era, but the girls I dated then really liked this group."
5,Cafe' Jacques holds up after all these years,"I've worn out the vinyl on both the first record and the second (International). I've got the first on cd and am anxiously waiting for the second one to come up. I think it was released on cd in '98 but haven't seen it yet. Anyway, these two are definitly worth checking out. Great production by Rupert Hine and fine craftmanship and songwriting. If you're a Cafe' Jacques fan you already know this."
5,functional as a sunsuit and swimsuit,"I like that this outfit provided a lot of coverage for sunny days, to prevent sunburn. Yet it's very lightweight on a hot day. The material makes it a good outfit for swimming, too. My favourite part is that it's the only swimsuit I found that has snaps for diaper changes."
3,A slight downer for downtempo and jazz aficianados,"This iteration of Verve Remixed is not nearly as satisfying as the first. The problem is simple: whereas the bulk of the original songs used in Vol. 1 are totally ripe for reconfiguration, the cuts on this new volume are not. Thus, the finished work here frequently sounds a bit contrived and forced, which is too bad, cuz the first one sounded relatively effortless and breezy. Track #7 is a case in point of the forced feel of things. ""Slap that Bass,"" the Nina Simone cuts (of course) and the H. Masekela tracks work nicely, however. To be honest, seven of the tracks from the program are really nice. Sadly, that's not nearly enough to surmount the bar set the first time around. Call it sequel blues, sophomore slump, or whatever, but this just isn't in my rotation right now. Peep Life:styles 4 Hero instead. The program is mixed, not ""remixed,"" but it's a cool banger in a jazzy vein and it works MUCH better."
4,I want to be locked up in the Verve vaults!,"Another set of great remixes. Probably better than the first Verve Remixed. If you want to be convinced how good this album is, just listen to Felix da House Cats remix (track #2) or the Gotan Project Remix (track #3)."
2,poor sequel in a fledgling series,the treatments of gems from the verve vaults this time 'round pale in comparison to the innovations from the first installment ('verve remixed'). the tempos and grooves are far more up and house than the mellower and hazy atmospheres that were so blissful to engage or loose yourself in on the prior. disappointing.
2,"Bought it just for ""Manteca""","The first track ""Manteca"" is awesome, and I liked ""Here Comes that Rainy Day"" but I'm not too crazy about the other tracks. The original songs are too buried in noise for my taste. My advice: don't buy this on a whim like I did just because you liked the first track."
1,DISAPPOINTED !!!,"This CD is nothing like the first one.It is far too laid back and more of an ""Easy Listening / Chill Out "" genre rather than real Jazz / downtempo /dance.If you're looking for music as in the first CD, you will be disappointed !!! My Grandmother could have done a better remix than whats on this CD!!!!.My advice to VERVE is that if you're going to produce a third CD of this type,"" Please Don't Bother""."
4,Very Pleased,"Let's face it, the mixed-genre cd's often come up a bit disappointing--even if it sounded great on paper. Not with Verve Remixed 2: an intersting cocktail mix. Nice beats, not too slamming, interesting arrangements. I was pleasantly surprised. If this sort of thing moves you check out Jazzanova from Berlin, and the Hi-Fidelity Compilations as well."
5,Old friends with new fashion tastes,"I enjoyed Remixed 2 just as much as Remixed 1 but the difference is -- I felt a much stronger personal connection to Remixed 2. If you're someone who listens to Ella in the dark or watches Casablanca alone with a glass of wine, you will gasp and blush at the way this album teases you with nostalgia yet spices it up with some very sexy rhythms and percussions. The remix of Nina Simone's ""Sinnerman"" bows low to the original and looks up its skirt at the same time. ""Angel Eyes"" and ""Whatever Lola Wants"" should not be listened to on a full moon or you'll get yourself in trouble. This is an album for lovers of all things sensual. If Lauren Bacall's line to Bogart about whistling makes you dizzy, get this album for appetizers. Get Pink Martini's Sympathique for the main course."
4,A Worthy Followup!,"Hopefully, Verve Remixed 3 will be released this year so I'll have some more amazing remixes to listen to. Volume 2 has some truly mindbending work, as well as a couple that are somewhat pedestrian. For me, the standouts are Gotan Project's remix (love the bandoneon!), which turns this song into audio crack. I cannot get tired of listening to it, and feel the need to take a tango lesson. Other standouts include Mondo Grosso's remix of Archie Shepp, which absolutely drags you onto the dance floor, Miguel Migs' ""Slap That Bass,"" which does the same. Of course, the two Nina Simone songs are standouts, as her music is ripe for these kinds of projects. The only three that didn't do the trick for me were numbers 4, 8, and 9, since they were too close to the originals and fairly unimaginative. If they weren't going to do much with them, they should have remixed different songs. Still, there is some amazing work present here, sure to delight your next house full of guests."
2,Waste of money,"Poorly written, and with little if any real value.Does anyone check these articles for grammar or spelling?Does not provide real advice or guidance. Simply a point of view (that I happen to agree with). I feel like a bought the first draft of the first chapter of a book that could be good. So save your money!"
3,Battle of An Loc is a keeper,"Excellent detail of one of the most important battles during the latter stages of the Vietnam War. Focus is obviously on the ground troups. I was somewhat disappointed with the lack of detail with regards to the ""gun ships"" of the Navy."
5,A Parents Dream,"I have finally heard rap music that I would love my children to hear. When you first listen to this album, you don't think gospel. These guys are taking gospel/hip-hop to the next level. The great part about it is that there music is not limited to a selected group. Anyone could vibe to their sound. This is cross-over for real. Keep it up Halo & Reign, the world needs to hear this."
3,For interior applications only,"This product works fine for interior applications but not so much for exterior wood surfaces. I used this in conjunction with Sun-Wax and on exterior wood surfaces like the front door of our home and it just could not hold full against direct sunlight and LA crappy air quality. In hindsight maybe I should have applied it more often than I did, like monthly, but I did not, only applying it every 4 to 6 months. Now for interior wood surfaces this product seems to work OK and works well with the sister product the orange spray."
3,Cool Sax,"I am a student in high school that participates in marching and concert band. I play the flute, but have always wanted to play the saxaphone so I could be in jazz band. This is the first saxaphone that I have found that is somewhat affordable... Whoever purchases this will be very lucky."
5,"Love, Love, Love","As a collector of decorating books with beautifull photos, I loved this book! If you love full-page, bright photographs of rooms, this will not disappoint. Highly recommend!"
3,For Mary Engelbreit Fans,"As a Mary Engelbreit fan, I did enjoy seeing her home. But I think this is more of a coffee table book or something a Mary Engelbreit collector will enjoy than a decorating idea book. If you're interested in cottage decorating, I think you will get a wider variety of ideas from Better Homes & Gardens and Sunset's cottage decorating books."
4,pendant,"The picture of this item needs to illustrate that the PIXIE IS NAKED. I couldn't give it to my 10 year old niece, and yikes, I had to scramble for another gift."
4,Classic funk for the real heads,"This LP is worth getting hold of for the cover alone- he looks so sad and on the back he's wearing some sort of dress standing in a library. Not long after making the album he died so maybe he knew it was his time or something, but there's definately emotion on here. And some banging breaks too, especially the classic Hard Times which Ghostface used on his last joint (Nutmeg's the track I think I think), but whatever it's a classic track every time.....in fact the LP is full of nice beats and pieces all given a soulfull funk edge by the Baby himself. Just get it and listen."
1,Disappointing,"It's a great movie, but this product is disappointing. Quality of print is poor. Worse, it is dubbed and there is no option to listen to it in the original French."
1,"Don't buy it, there are quality versions of the movie out there!","I had to return this DVD. The quality was terrible, like a bootleg copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of an old videotape. Plus it is DUBBED in ENGLISH! There is no option to listen to it in French with subtitles. It has no original cover art or DVD labeling. PASS this up."
4,Waterwise Keenwise Descaler -,"I have used this product and I bought my original container at the time I purchased my Waterwise distiller. Frankly I paid less for it then Amazon charges. In any event, it seems to work fine, although it's still not real clear to me how to get the scale off the inside of the lid, when the instructions warn against filling the boiler pot over the ""max"" line. The water obviously splatters up there, so that tends to make cleaning the lid difficult. Oh well."
3,works fine but too pricey,We make a lot of distilled water in my household and coupled with living in Arizona where the water is really saturated with minerals I have to descale the distiller often. I bought this product and others like it labeled for distillers. After spending too much money on these specialty mineral removers I researched the key ingredients and I've found that pure citric acid works as well and is much lower priced. After looking around on the internet I found the best price for citric acid on Amazon.
4,my go to source,I don't drink tap water and with nestle coke and pepsi controlling all the retail bottled water I decided to really purify my water at home...this product is a must have to clean any metal surface when the tap water has minerals (the kind you didn't ask for and don't want). The minerals build up and eventually block functaionality...my water distiller has a metal canister and you would not believe the hard gunk that accumulates in the bottom. Couldn't live without it and it lasts a long time. This vender does a good job of getting it to you on time and in great condition.
2,straight to the recycle bin,"While my copy of Kesselring was the ancient hardcover edition, it took me until last year to finally get around to reading it. This is a disappointing book in that it is typical of much of military history written 30 to 40 years ago. Lacking in the original detail that comes with a well-researched study, this generalized text provides neither balance or a real portrait of this enigmatic general. Macksey fails to rise above his bias or provoke any new discussion on ""Smiling Albert"" with this mundane biography. My copy went straight to the recycle bin."
3,FUll Flavor but not quite hot enough.,"This coffee maker looks cool, it has a nice form uncluttered with unnecessary labels. The coffee it makes is full flavored. The one drawback is that it does not make the coffee hot enough. This does not bother me that much, but it may bother some. I have heard that a lower brewing temperature makes for fuller flavor, maybe this is the trade-off."
3,Feels Cheap,"I'm very disapointed at this Krups coffeemaker. The cover feels loose and the plastic feels cheap. And the lid of the pot is hard to put on (and hard to get off, too). You can get a coffeemaker with similar function/quality with much less money. Save your money !"
1,"Cheap, flimsy, wasteful junk","This is my third Krups coffeemaker. The last two were decent and served me well for years. I thought that despite the low price this unit would be a good buy. What garbage it turned out to be. The cheap top broke off while removing it from the box! The poorly designed carafe lid needs special effort to be put on securely EVERY time you make coffee. The coffee isn't very hot. After 5 days of trying, the coffee is still weak. Eventually I will find the correct mixture, but it's already clear that it will use 30% more coffee for the same flavor as my previous Krups machines. Spend a little more on a good machine or you will spend more on coffee. Don't say I didn't warn you!!"
4,"Small, cute, but no ""aroma guard""","Takes up very little counter space and the carafe is lightweight. Brews full pot in 5 minutes. Full flavor. No frills design without the water filter, which we don't need in our area, and no aroma guard which other models have. Great buy."
3,"Wordy, not many pictures","I got this book off Bookmooch.com for my young son who loves his toy space shuttle. I think if he was older and a reader - or doing a book report on the space shuttle the old fashioned way (i.e. our internet was down) - this book would be pretty good.There are 10 wordy chapters and a glossary. Unfortunately, the few images it has inside are all black and white and of pretty poor quality.Again, it's terribly dated and you could find better info/images on the web. If you're looking for a space shuttle book for someone under, say, the 5th grade, don't bother with this one."
3,Basic moves for true beginners,"I'm in NY, I rented this at Blockbust*r online. This is for true beginners. There is no workout, it's more like a class.Victoria is alone on a simple set with rug floor. The music is Eastern & played very low.You get a warm up/stretch/contractions, learn posture, arms/hands, slides/circles, camels/undulations, hip drops/lifts, figure 8s, 2 shimmies & twists, grapevine, simple Egyptian steps, simple turn.Her teaching style has the same info, or slightly less then Neena & Veena, Neon, etc. She teaches very slow & patiently & a bit on the boring side.The performance at the end was very nice. Only simple moves, she is pretty fluid & gets into the music, but seems to be too careful sometimes & other times a bit sloppy in technique.You can see a preview at youtube com under ""Bellydance One-on-One: Essential Technique with Virginia"""
4,Very good book.,"This book helped me a lot, this book gives you a quick general overview of all the major functions of Maya, without going into too much detail. It's not too long and is full of lots of colourful pictures, which makes it easy to read compared to other Maya books which can be huge and daunting in their detail.I recommend this book to people who have never done any 3d animation who are interested in trying it, as the name suggests it is essentially a beginners book; don't expect to be able to produce a short movie at the end of it. This book merely skims the surface of a giant program, but it'll give you an idea of how to go about creating an animation.It's good to just start out with this book to give you an idea of what Maya involves, and after finishing you can start with one of the larger Maya books that are out there to explore it deeper and be able to produce your own short animations or models depending on what you want to use Maya for."
2,Ridiculous CD,"I initially really enjoyed the fast pace of this book, but was pretty dismayed to find out that the CD for this Maya 8 book only has Maya 7 on it. How could this have happened? Its nonsense."
4,Read about the Northwest Coast,"This title is of note as it is one of the few books written by a male about his experience teaching in the bush. The author lived among the Yupik Eskimos of Wales and Scammon Bay on the Northwest Coast of Alaska. The author speaks warmly of his experience with the villagers, however there are a few passages that could be perceived as negative towards Alaska natives. In addition even though the author gets along well with the community, like so many bush teachers, he leaves after only a few short years. Although the meat of this book is the author's adventures with his new friends, there are several comments on bush schools in the first chapter and several more sprinkled throughout. This book is a quick, smooth, and easy read and there is plenty to be learned from this book. Photos are interesting but too small and dark."
2,Frustrated,"The idea is great. When I first put them in (3) they worked great then two of them started coming on by them selves. When I did a little checking on line it would seem this is quite common. So far I have only had problems with this type of switch, so I am thinking of changing them to the XPS3 which requires a neutral wire, but it seems to be a more heavy duty & reliable switch."
1,Remote Switch Did Not Work Correctly,"The X10 remote control light dimmer switch I ordered did not work correctly. The light, at full illumination with the X10 switch was much dimmer than the light used with a standard switch. Since it would cost me as much, or more, to pay to return the item for repair than I paid for it originally, I put a standard switch in and called it a day."
1,Remote dimmer,"Unit did not function. Cannot tell if this is a problem with the unit or my circuitry. Previous unit worked for some time, but then would not function properly."
5,Continue This Product,"There's nothing else quite like this product. When used in conjuction with th PSC01, allows any driveway sensor to turn on front porch lights, garage flood lights or any other light you desire (40 to 150 watts) when a vehicle pulls in the driveway. Works great!"
5,Stay in BED !!!,No more getting out of bed to turn off the lights and then stumbling your way back in the dark of night. This product is absolutely the best. Also used it to tell the kids it's time to get to bed- simply push the button on the main control and WOW - their lights go off.
4,X-10 Remote Control Light Switches,"X10 WS467 Remote Control Light Dimmer SwitchWhat a great way to control the lights and small appliances all around the home, we have used the x10 system for twenty years and well are satisfied. The X10 light and appliance remote control(wireless) system works very well for controlling appliances i.e. a fan, coffee maker, etc and dimming or turning on/off lights on a timer or with a wireless remote control."
3,JLab Audio Miniblaster,"The Miniblaster is just that...it is loud...sound quality is not great....convenient size, portability make it desirable ...if you are looking for a convenient way to listen to your ipod while traveling, walking, etc....however, if you are looking for quality sound, you get what you pay for..."
4,Sonic Screwdriver,"This is a kind of funny toy. It's cheap, and it's probably worth the price, but it looks like the prop from the show, and it does what it needs to do (light up). I had a bit of trouble at first getting it to light, but since then it's been okay. I would probably only by this toy if someone is dressing up as the Doctor for Halloween or something and doesn't want to build one. And of course, if your kids really like it, then you can probably cave, since I think it'll last a while."
1,Not worth the money,"I have been a huge fan of Doctor Who for decades, and I positively love the 10th Doctor, so when i saw this sonic screwdriver flash light, i had to have it. It cost me almost $14, and I thought it would be worth it. Not the case. What i received was a tiny novelty toy. It would be funny to have only as a gag, but it is not functional in any way. I sent mine back. Too expensive for the quality of the item."
3,It was alright,"I have been an avid fan since the early eighties of Doctor Who. I introduced my son to the show a few years ago. He decided to be the Doctor for Halloween. I ordered this one and we both waited eagerly for it to come. I was a little disappointed when the Sonic Screwdriver came, it looked okay but for the money it would have been nicer if it were better made. The molding was not tight in places making it so it didn't fit properly and didn't do anything but light up. Sounds would have been fun to add to it. Anyway, the thing lasted through halloween, shortly after that my son took it apart to figure out how it worked. Didn't ever work after that.If you want to have this just as a collector, then do so, not really a great toy for under 10 years old. Light was weak, so don't expect it to light your path."
4,"Not to scale, but cute","I enjoyed mine quite a bit as the completion of my Halloween costume. However, the model is not a full-sized replica, and it does not make the whirring noise..."
2,to cheaply made,To cheaply made.not really cool.needs to make noise too.needs to be heavier.spend more and get more.
3,Sonic Screwdriver Review,"I thought it was rather expensive for a plastic flashlight, but they (fake sonic screwdrivers) are hard to find here in the US. My 15 year old daughter, who is an avid Dr Who fan, thinks that it is great, so that's what counts. So on that count, I have to give a thumbs up! To bad they don't make these things with added bells and whistles."
5,My non-whovian friends are confused,"It's so much fun! It can actually be used as a flashlight, or you can, you know, run around shouting ""I'm the doctor"" and scanning things while making sound effects."
2,"Not an adults ""toy""",One cannot expect much for the price. It is plastic and very toyish. A child might think it is neat. An adult would not be interested. Spend more if you are getting it for an adult Dr Who fanItem arrived quickly.
4,Sonic Screwdriver Torch,"It's great, bery bright, and looks blue when you click the button. But, it seems bigger then it really is."
2,"Cute idea, but more a laser pointer than a true torch","I bought this item as a gift for a newbie Doctor Who fan. I thought the practicality of a Doctor Who novelty that is also useful as a torch would be a nice fit. However the item is a made for a bit younger a person than I thought and the ""torch"" aspect of the gift is more of a laser pointer. Still a cool idea."
2,Not so great for the price,"As one review mentioned, this item does look like someone can get it from the dollar store. The price is absolutely not worth the build quality."
3,flashlight,"It's what I expected for the price - makes a nice little light to keep in my purse, even if it's just plastic."
1,Disappointed,"Smaller and cheaper than it appeared in the photo. I actually bought a second, better one, to replace this as a Christmas gift for my son."
2,a big disappoinment at this price,"Sonic flashlight looks like a cheap, cereal box toy. For some reason I expected a sound, or something that would make it look like a Dr. Who artifact, but it does not. Both recipients at Christmas would not have known what it was without the packaging. Very disappointed."
2,My boys love this toy...but it's not sturdy enough for play,"This sonic screwdriver turned out to be a disappointment. I initially gave it a very positive review -- but both ""screwdrivers"" we ordered broke in exactly the same place! The casing right above the switch. The first broke after only two days. This item really isn't appropriate for kids. Mine were pretty careful with the screwdrivers too; they just turned them on and off a lot.My original review: ""My sons are huge Dr. Who fans. We got them each a sonic screwdriver flashlight -- for fun, and also as an accessory for my 7-year-old's Dr. Who Halloween costume. So far my boys are having a blast ""sonicking"" everything in sight. The flashlight looks authentic and has a beautiful bright blue light. A big hit!!"""
1,Not worth the price,"My daughter ordered this item, expecting a good quality screwdriver. When it arrived we were all surprised at the cheap construction and overall quality. It looked like it was something we could have bought at the Dollar Store. We expected more for the price, and quickly returned it. We would definitely not recommend it's purchase."
1,Dr Who Screwdriver,I was very disappointed with this item. My son had it not 24 hourswhen it fell apart and couldn't be put back together. It is not madewell at all and is not durable enough. My son is over 13 and did not playwith it roughly or leave it on constantly. It was a waste of money andvery overpriced for the product you receive.
2,Not exactly as advertised,"Smaller than advertised, and not very well-built. Looks like it will be easily broken, especially the fragile on/off switch. On the plus side, the light is very bright."
5,Love it!,"My little brother bought me this for Christmas knowing how much I love Doctor Who. It has to be the sturdiest torch ever. It has some cracks in it now because I have dropped it so many times, but they are small and hardly noticeable. I even sent it though the washer twice because I left it in my pockets. It still works! Now that is a sonic screwdriver! The light is very bright too even if it wasn't small I would say it was bright for it's size. My only complaints are that I wish it was closer in size to the original and I wish it made the noise that every Doctor Who fan associates with the sonic screwdriver. I have had a lot of fun with this and it has come in handy loads of times. I hope this review was helpful."
4,The Story of the Root Children grows dearer each reading,"I was hesitant to purchase this book after reading some of the other reviews, however; I am happy to have followed my instincts. The illustrations are lovely and the story is a wonderful celebration of the seasons. My daughter enjoys having it read to her time and time again. Pair the reading of the book with a craft of making some root children and you surely will have a lovely afternoon."
5,A fantastic book for all!,This is one of my all time favorite books. The illustrations are fantastic and the story line is meaningful and creative.
3,Who do you imagine Mother Earth to be?,"This book is very popular among other Waldorf schoolers due to it's depiction of the seasons and the cycles within nature...I was suprised to find that the format and illustrations are not lovely in their simplicity, as some illustrators are capable of acheiving.Even more surprising was the authors depiction of Mother Earth! I have never thought of Mother Earth as a tired old woman and certainly do not wish for my children to see her in this light. Nature is vibrant and full of life, not shortsighted and foreboding as she appears here. I can't help feeling sorry for the little root children who are tasked by her in this story.For a more aesthetically satisfying display of nature, see any of Elsa Beskow's books, particulary, Children of the Forest and Around the Year."
2,bad translation,"I originally read this book in German, a book with big beautiful pictures, few but meaningful words- that rhyme. This book doesn't compare. It is not fun to read for an adult. The pictures are nice, but I ended up reading it with my own words. It could be that Mother Earth's quilt, is a better translation of die Wurzelkinder."
5,Family tradition,I read this to my children and now grandchildren as my father read it to me and his parents to him. There is just a reason why such books keep being passed along through the generations. This is a must have book in every one of our family households.
5,Delish.....,Tasty and a good buy. Beware.....these boxes are big! I wouldn buy again but don't have a cabinet big enough to fit them. Great buy for a large family but overkill for an old single like me. The product is very good and I enjoy eating them as a snack with no milk and sometimes as a snack with milk.
1,GMO's cause Cancer,"This product contains GMO's Known to cause Cancer and Organ Failure, Im sorry but I will not be feeding my family your cereal anymore until you use safer ingredients. Shame on you"
5,I LOVE THAT CRUNCH!,"Kellogg's Frosted Flakes Cereal, 61.9 Ounce Box, I love this Cereal and sometimes I eat it with some Milk in the morning. I think almost everyone has grown up eating Frosted Flakes, the very first Cereal introduced by Kellogg's Company in the early 50's, is Fortified with 10 Vitamins and Minerals and it's only 120 Calories per serving, how good is That! ..(wait, I'm gonna say it later on)Frosted Flakes doesn't taste Stale or overly sweet and sometimes I eat it right out of the Box as a Snack, one of life's simple Pleasures. The 61.9 ounce Box is like getting two large boxes inside a Huge one I would have to pay a lot more where I shop to get the equivalent amount of two Boxes for that Price, and I think...that is GR-R-REAT! Thank You"
3,Kellog's Frosted Flakes,"I found these Frosted Flakes to be good but as compared to what comes from the local grocery store the flakes from Amazon had a different color and taste. I received the flakes in a timely manner and they still had almost a year left before reaching the Best Used by Date, but these had a look and taste as if they had already passed the expiration date. The coloring was considerably darker and they seemed to have lost their sweet taste. They are still edible and I am eating them."
5,A classic never goes out of style,"I've been eating Frosted Flakes for as long as I can remember. One of those simple treats that never gets old. Although, as age has not stood still for me, I tend to mix this with a more age-appropriate cereal such as bran flakes. A good-sized touch of Tony the Tiger makes the good-for-you cereal much easier to deal with.The box is huge, but inside there are two sealed bags of a more normal size that will fit in the cabinet. Very fresh, and if you catch it on a price dip, it's better priced than the warehouse clubs.Love those flakes!"
4,"It was good, but you have to read the sequel.","I enjoyed this book. I think that I will enjoy it even more after I read ""Undercover Angels"" I would very much like to see Tom and Elizabeth get together, inspite of the way he treated her. He was cruel, but he realized his mistakes and truly loves her, and she obviously still cares very much for him. This book has potential,. but it's not the best SVU I've ever read."
4,It's getting better.,"This book is great, although I wish that Liz and Tom would finally get back together and Scott should just mosey on out of the story. He's the only thing that's holding this book back from its full potential."
4,Good mask for the money,"This mask has worked just fine this season. It does not feel too heavy on my head, and it is easy to remove on the move. It takes foul balls and pitches quite well - only a little sting at the time of the hit. If you are looking for a solid quality mask on a budget, then this one will work well for you."
4,MUY BUEN PRODUCTO PARA UMPIRES,"Buen dia tengo unos 14 años en el mundo del arbitraje aca en mi pais Venezuela, y esta es una excelente mascara o careta como le llamamos aca, es solida, fuerte , muy elegante."
3,Bad carafe,No cup markings on carafe. Carafe is made paper thin so it breaks easily and you have to go and buy another one from Krups.
5,My kid LOVES this program!,"Sing Spell simplifies learning to read. It focuses on all the phonics rules in an easy to understand and fun to learn way. My daughter was struggling with reading using another phonics based program, but once we switched she loves to do her reading, writing and spelling! She asks me to do it every day and is making great progress in her reading and spelling. I would receommend this for any begining reader."
2,DO NOT BUY VHS/CASSETTE TAPES,"For $250 you get a VHS tape of 1hr and 9 minutes of instructional information that you can not use unless you have a player for this. Sorry but it is 2010- and there are 6 cassette tapes.. OH YEAH!!!! Hello, my vehicle won't play those. I called the number on the box and was told they get this complaint ALL THE TIME and the SSRW company won't fix it. SSRW= THE LEAST YOU GUYS COULD DO IS PUT IT ON THE WEB so that your customers paying $250 can still watch the video. This is one of my few purchases in 15 yrs of homeschooling where I feel like there was false advertising and NOT worth the price. SAVE YOUR MONEY. VERY VERY angry with this company right now..."
1,not worth it,a big box with multiple small boxes inside stuffed with papers and cards. Does not worth the money. I should return it if I had opened the box within the return period.
5,Learning to read made fun!,This program is great. We have been doing now for about 3 weeks and my eight yr. old sons loves it! I am sure you could use this program for younger children too. He was having problems catching on to reading so we are starting at the begining and learning to read. He is excited to do school in the morning because of this program. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting their kids to read well.
4,Unassuming and well-written,"This is a very well-told morality tale. I read it over a few nights to my kids, and they appreciated the story--even the courtroom justice section--they knew all the characters well, and were glad to hear it each night. I was wondering if they got the lessons that the story conveyed, so the day after we finished it I asked them all sorts of questions: what did we learn from this story? who was right? who was wrong? what could this character have done differently? and so on. Lo and behold, they got it! They learned some great lessons from this unassuming tale.(less)"
1,"Looks great, but not sensible","This product looks great and is well packaged for shipping, but has some a serious problem. The feet on the coasters are glued on with glue that comes off very easily, particularly if you put hot drink on the coaster. I am slowly loosing feet on all my coasters and am quite disappointed. Also the stand legs are not attached to the base square, and whether or not this is done on purpose really doesn't matter as it looks sloppy."
3,Ok for what I spent,"The coasters themselves are nice, but right out of the box, the metal post on the holder stand had popped off. Kind of waiting to see if the silicone on the bottom of the coasters come off as well. I didn't really spend enough to warrant the hassle of sending back. All-in-all, as usual, you get what you pay for."
2,Damaged on Arrival - But OK,"I really like the glass coasters, but was disappointed that both of the sets I ordered arrived with damaged coaster holders. Also, one coaster only had two gel supports. Very poorly done, in my opinion. However, I like the glass design, and it is not worth the hassle of sending them back."
4,being new to reformation theology this was great reading,"I am not finished but what i have read i am will pleased, and would recommend it to anyone, especially Armenians."
4,REMARKABLE,"It's very easy to use. Can reach where I couldn't before. It may be a little heavy to hold, but I'm getting use to it. I like the idea of rechargeable instead of batteries."
4,Nice box,"Young one loves horses and music boxes, and this jewelry box is perfect for her. You need to be careful of the horse when closing the box, but you can't go wrong with this at it's price. (About $[...] as I write this)."
4,Great Gift for Horse Lover!!,"I bought this toy for my niece, who is a horse lover. It is a very beautiful jewelry box and she really loved it. It doesn't look like the sturdiest of jewelry boxes, so I wouldn't suggest it for a person or child that is rough on their belongings."
1,DEFECTIVE ITEM,"Real good work guys, it was damaged, sent the unit back, please respond by a replacement because i do like the unit. Thanx, SAL"
4,Once Upon a Time,This was a new author for me and I enjoyed her writing enough to purschase several other books. I am always looking for someone new to read and I was not disappointed withher.
5,Fantastic earrings!,"These earrings are fantastic! They're more lightweight than the picture would lead, but I think the photo's specifically for the amazing amount of detail in such a small earring!"
5,beautiful earrings,Nice hamsa earrings! I bought it as a present for my girlfriend and she wears them everyday! A balanced and shining hamsa.I recomend this ones.
1,Janie Jones,"A precocious young girl played by an up-and-coming starlet is left by her deadbeat mom to spend time with her absentee celebrity father, forcing a familial bond to develop that will lead the father, deeply in need of redemption, to a better place. If the plot of Janie Jones sounds familiar, it's because its skeleton pretty closely matches that of Sofia Coppola's film Somewhere. The difference? Somewhere is worth watching, while Janie Jones is not. So what kept the latter from reaching the heights of the former? I say Janie Jones, which stars Abigail Breslin as the daughter and Alessandro Nivola as the father, is entirely too familiar in its themes and, despite effective performances from its leads, never quite musters the dramatic heft it needs to outshine the others of its ilk."
3,It's a girl,"This is a story that has been done before, with an interesting twist. A man has a daughter brought into his life - that he never knew existed, and suddenly he becomes responsible for her. The father is a musician and the daughter turns out to have as much or more talent than the father. The daughter is played by Abigail Breslin, who does her usual outstanding job of acting - absolutely stealing the movie from everyone around her. Her performance alone is worth the price of admission. Sad to say not much else is.The movie is 107 minutes long. There are extras of interviews with Abigail, Allessandro Nivola and David Rosenthal. There is also audio commentary with the director and the producers. One real irritation is that there are no closed captions.This is a somewhat entertaining film."
5,vote for Pedro t-shirt,"i gave the t-shirts a 5-star rating because the movie is so great-the t-shirt is a great reminder of "" Napoleon Dynamite""-to all fans of the movie,i recommend this product."
4,Paradigms of reading: relevance Theory and Deconstruction,"The book is a bold attempt to challenge the conventionalized wisdom that has hegamonized our understanding of reading for long now. By articulating a pragmatically oriented approach to reading, the author has presented a stunning array of insights and issues which if used in the context of teaching reading/literacy, will yield countless benefits to the teaching-learning communities around the world and across the cultures."
3,my husband rock hudson,"This book by Phyllis Gates is interesting in that it is seen from a different angle from other books on rock hudson. I have read several autobiographies on Rock Hudson and they all suggest that Phyllis (His wife) was a lesbian and knew exactly what Rock was when she married him. She claims she had no idea about his chosen lifestyle and through-out the book she paints herself as the innocent victim. She does not paint rock in a very good light at all. A good read, but I found that it did not ring true in many instances, as compared with other rock hudson books I have read."
4,This could be key for the PMP exam.,"I cleared my PMP exam in first attempt with bare minimum preparation. I never read PMBOK guide. Just paced myself through this book and took few sample tests from (pmstudy.com). Though the questions are outdated on both the book and the website but they still hammer in the basics of PM, PM framework and the do's and don'ts for the exam. The exam format changed sometime in Oct. 05 and not much is available for the new exam format. Nevertheless, these two things and roughly around 2 weeks of preparation helped me to breeze the exam yesterday. Good luck to all of you."
1,I hated this book,"This was the book provided by the training class I took. I hated this book not because of the content, but because of the author's condescending attitude. I got tired of reading, ""a great project manager would know...""It's become the standard joke answer in our group when one of the PMs asks another PM a question. ""Well, if you were a great project manager, you wouldn't have to ask that question.""Studying for the PMP is hard enough. I didn't need to be insulted on top of it. I've switched to Joseph Phillips ""All In One"" book, which also follows the PMBOK chapter for chapter. It has a supportive tone and comes with a CD that contains two unique and complete exams.Just say no to Rita."
1,PMP exam book,"I ordered this product more than a month ago and have not received it. I have not heard from the vendor at all. I heard from Amazon this week that I will receive a refund if my product does not ship within 30 days. I have never had this happen. On the day I placed the order I ordered 4 items, three have not shown up and I have paid for them! Poor customer service and communication. I didn't realize when you place an order from Amazon there is an increased risk you may not get your items."
3,"Good book, but .....","This book is good as a reference. But to pass PMP test, I wouldn't recommend this book. I prepared for my PMP test using PMBOK guide + this book. I read this book couple of times. It gave me a good handle of certain tricky concepts. However, when I gave my PMP test yesterday, reading this book, hardly helped me. Thanks to PMBOK guide, I passed the PMP test on my first attempt."
3,Not quite a must,"Hi Guys,For those of you who intend to take PMP in the near future, I would say this is ""NOT"" a ""must buy"" book. Rita helps, but the hype you see in some of the reviews is just irrelevant. I was probably amongst one of the youngest professionals to have successfully cracked PMP which made it even more tough for me to deal with the questions in the exam. All you need is PMBOK, Crosswind plus maybe Rita( you can substitute this book with any other PMP book), with a thorough inside-out knowledge. Bingo!!You can crack PMP!!Megha Sarathy,PMP."
4,Start with this book for your PMP exam -,This was a great book to help simplify the concepts of the PMBOK Guide. The practice test at the end of each chapter was very valuable to think about the concepts in a new light (PMI-ism).But what really helped me pass the test was Rita's Exam Simulation Software (PMFastrack). I highly recommend both of these items for preparation of the PMP exam. Good Luck!
3,PMP Exam prep,"The material in the book is good. Where as the book contains small letters and font is not that great for eyes. It is hard to read continuously. This book is tougher than other 2 PMP books I read and challenging me, which is a good thing."
5,Working toward my PMP,"The book is geared around helping you pass the PMP. It is not for someone looking to learn project management. As a prep guide, the book does a very good job of presenting key concepts and good practice exercises."
5,Pass the PMP on your first try,"This a GREAT book to use if you are studying for the PMP exam. Don't get me wrong, the exam questions are much harder than the questions that appear in this book. However, the time spent reading/studying the chapter material, reviewing Rita's exam tips and taking the practice exams at the end of each chapter will give you sizable exposure to the material and testing style that appears on the exam.I studied this book 3 weeks (about 9 hours a week) before taking the PMP exam. I read the book twice, did all of the activities and took all of the practice tests. I took the exam in 3 hours and passed the exam with flying colors. If you are serious about passing the PMP exam and getting your certification, this book is worth the time and money."
3,Companion CD,"The book contains valuable information, worth knowing to pass the test. It is very structured and intuitive.It is probably written with Project Manager wannabes in mind. The writing style is... not for seasoned professionals. It seems to scares the reader to pay attention using phrases like ""Stop. Read the last paragraph again. This is where most people fail. This part is really difficult."" Such nagging words drain my confidence. When I do not get - what is so difficult in it, I further develop self-doubt.Quite often it warns the readers - ""If you did not get this one, you are a pin head and you need more experience to even get it"". Maybe she is right. But she does sound like my 7th grade maths teacher.And by the way - What are the mac users supposed to do with the companion CD? CD works on Windows only."
5,Good product,"Hello,i have purchased following for the PMP preparation1. Crosswing PMP Exam Sim 7.12. PMP FastTrack 53. 3rd PMBOK4. PMP Exam Prep 5I stoped using Crosswing as soon as i tried the also the Fasttrack. So i was using only items 2-4 from the list below for the preparation. That is more then enough to get 100% ready for the exam. Yesterday I did successfully the exam."
3,Vedro PMP,"Overall a good book not great but good. It was a bit wordy and some of the examples etc, were hard to follow. I used it to help prepare for the PMP exam and passed on my first try. Although I thought it was a bit long winded the questions were actually closer in some regards to actual questions on the PMP exam I took. I thought Andy Crowe's book was better overall ."
4,Must Read for PMP,"I read this book besides the PMBOK. This book is a MUST to Pass PMP in the 1st attempt. Read this book atleast 3 times.Rita's PMism and her summarized listing on various topics in every chapter is a winner. The questions at the end of each chapter also helps for the real exam.One thing that is not explicitly mentioned in the book are the ITTOs for the knowledge group and the exam asks many direct questions on that, i guess therefore refering the PMBOK complements that effort.Having said that, PMP exam is not easy, you really have to know the concepts well and know the processes in detail.This book will help."
4,Good but not great,"I have heard from many people that this is one of the best study guides for the PMP test. While I agree it is comprehensive, it is clearly written with the assumption that the reader is currently a project manager in a traditional, most likely technical, corporate environment. I have been a project manager in the construction industry and although many of my techniques are similar to those used in corporate america, I feel like we are speaking two different languages. I find myself stumbling over the terminology much more often than the concepts - or if I'm not getting the concept right away, it's because of the terminology, not the underlying logic. Hopefully, in the next edition, the author takes more time to introduce terminology and does not assume her reader already works for a large technical company."
5,Worth every penny!!!,"If you read this book 3 times and take the practice tests, you'll pass the PMP. It's that simple.I also took a week long $$$ course (paid by employer, phew!), but this book was better."
2,Confusing and contradictory,"I just passed the PMP exam, but little credit goes to this book. I found the book's questions & answers to be confusing, contradictory, and plagued with personal opinions vs. objective references to the PMBOK. For example, questions 15 & 20 in the HR chapter are plain wrong when describing PM's ""referent"" power.I'm glad I took a 4-day PMP exam prep class and used PMBOK's Q&A; book with 200 practice questions. For the best use of your time, learn the PMBOK content by taking a reputable exam prep class. The hardest part of the exam is answering 200 questions in a row - make sure you practice that aspect before the real thing. An exam prep class followed by 3 or 4 days of practice questions is the quickest way to get your PMP."
3,this is not my first exam,"The way the author speaks to the reader is not quite my style. Like most people buying this book it is not their first exam/ study. Over the years I have developed my own learning style (like everyone does). For some reason the author feels the urge to change/contribute to that. Usualy, after reading a paragraph I do not fully comprehend the first time, I go back and read the paragraph again. subsequently, it is rather annoying to read the next line after that paragraph which says: ""STOP, GO BACK, AND READ AGAIN!"" also the frequent rather ominously remarks "" if you lack this and that particular practical experience as a project manager in the past you will NEVER pass this exam"" is rather strange and I am not sure what the author tries to achieve with that remark. The value of this book remains to be seen at the exam..."
4,This book helped me pass the exam.,"I bought this book and it definitely helped me pass the exam. I liked the fact that Rita focuses on learning the process from real world experience instead of just memorizing inputs/outputs for all the PMBOK processes. I went through the book twice before the exam. I should have gone through 3 times, but didn't allow myself enough time for that.There were some questions in the exam not covered in the book for me. That is why I didn't give it 5 stars. I'd like to have one book that you study that has EVERYTHING you need in it. Definitely look at the PMBOK directly, and study the procurement chapter closely."
4,PMP here I come...,"I've only just started making use of this text, but I already recognize that it adds that 'ooomph' that can take you over the edge when attempting the PMP exam. Rita's 'Tricks of the Trade' alone are definitely worth the price of purchase.I'll complete this review in March '07 after writing the exam."
1,NEVER RECEIVED THE PRODUCT,"I wish I could write a review of this product, unfortunately never received it and thus cannot review it neither. This is the very first time I have this problem with Amazon."
3,"Too wordy, too hard, not useful","Rita's book has jokes, stories and unrelated non-senses. On top of that, the practice questions are hard and complicated. If you just want to pass the exam buy something else (like Crowe's)"
4,"PMP Exam Prep, Fifth Edition: Rita's Course in a Book for Passing the PMP Exam","PMP Exam Prep, Fifth Edition: Rita's Course in a Book for Passing the PMP Exam"
5,"PMP Exam Prep, Fifth Edition: Rita's Course in a Book for Passing the PMP Exam",Great condition!! The book came faster than I anticipated. It is great!!! Thanks
1,This book needs re-writng. It did'nt work for me!,"I can't remember reading a book that is so patronizing as this. After reading through the entire book once I dumped it because I could bear the pain no longer. The clichés and the put-downs I found very annoying.Is that to say there were no golden nuggets from this book? Of course not, but when you are reading it and beginning to enjoy the content, Rita throws in a phrase like ""If you are great project manager you will do this...."". Project Management is not set in stone, different organizations adopt different project methodologies, so its not a one hat fits all profession.Many other readers enjoyed reading it as reflected in the reviews, and have used it to pass their exams, but it definitely was not for me, hence 1 star."
2,"Thorough, but opinionated","The good: it's thorough and covers more material than a number of other prep books out there. There is material covered here in depth that isn't in the PMBOK. The author does have some good explanations for the PMBOK content that, if you can get past the author's patronizing tone, can be helpful.The bad: it's full of Rita's opinions on what you should do and it reminds you that the reason no one knows the full title of this book is because she's good at relationship marketing. There is material here that isn't in the PMBOK -- material which I found confusing and, at times, contrary to what was in the PMBOK. I hated the attitude of the author, found the ""games"" to be insulting to my intelligence, and found that I was better off just reading the PMBOK."
4,PMP Certification,"My review is going to be disappointing to all Rita 'fans'. I read this book just once, with great difficulty and found it very shallow and boring. This book does cover some topics that are not very well covered in the PMBOK but I could not see the need in buying this book when I could get them all off by an Internet search. Even here, I found atleast a few questions in the HR area that were neither covered in PMBOK or in this Book. That in my opinion defeated the purpose of having this book to begin with.To be fair, the questions at the end of the book are pretty good and some of excersises are ok. The CD at the end of the book can go straight to the shredder and has no information in it.I did clear the PMP in my first attempt but I attribute it to the PMBOK and some googling more than this book."
5,Rita's Course in a Book the best help to get PMP Certification,"As Unisys University Consultant in Brazil, we've been using Rita's book as a support documentation for our internal professionals who needs to get PMP Certification. During the last three years, has been the best tool to prepare them to the exam. Our approval rate is over 90%.If you intend to get the certification, this should be your study book together with the PMBok."
4,Helped me pass the test and improve my processes,"I have over 10 years of project management experience, but realized I didn't know everything. So I purchased this book and found several areas I needed to brush up on, plus learned techniques I had never used before. This book was invaluable in getting me ready for the PMP exam, which I took and passed Jan. 30, 2006. I am also starting to implement several of the tools I learned in my team's projects to improve our implementation. I highly recommend this book to anyone getting ready to take the PMP exam or just wanting to learn techniques that will improve their current processes."
4,Excellent study aid,"Of the 3 books I studied for my PMP, this one was a closest match to the style and content of the questions on the test. Without this book I would not have passed, but this book is only a supplement. The practice questions are great but by no means an exhaustive collection of questions. if anything, this book should be about 50% larger, with more material. But it is well worth the money and time."
3,It helps..,"This book should only be used as one of the guides for your exam prep. Don't just rely on this. Study the PMBOK throughly, it helps. There were quite a few topics/terms in the exam that were neither covered in this book nor PMBOK. I always used to get 80-90% in Rita's simulation exams, questions, but the real exam was a bit harder than anticipated.I passed the exam, but there were many questions that frustrated me a lot. Contrary to expectations there were quite a few calculations from procurement, but none on Network diagram or critical path etc. The questions are much more wordy/tricky in the actual exam than Rita's and so are the options.Good luck.John"
2,"No, not worth it...","I used this and Andy Crowe's, I highly recommend Andy Crowe's - did not like Rita's book..."
5,Excellent and best written book for PMP yet!,"To make the project management material sound so exciting is no small feat. Rita writes her book in the perfect balance of conversation, discipline for the reader, no-nonsense tips and expectations from PMP, and draws on brilliant learning techniques to help you understand the concepts, rather than memorize them - even though there are some specific areas you do need to memorize as she points out. I am almost 30% through the book and intend to finish before taking the exam. Highly recommend it!"
5,The De Facto PMP Exam Book,"Read whatever other book you want to read, but this is the de facto book to prepare for the PMP exam. Not perfect, but a must. While preparing for the exam, you also learn quite a few things about project management along the way."
3,pmp-review,"the disappointing part of this book is the dull and boring tone of the text. with respect to the exam this book is good and gives quite a good context. i did not find the rita's process chart to be very helpful, instead pmbok was much simpler to follow. In terms of coverage and clarity and helpful tips this book does it job. however i found the exam version from rita - fastrack to be quite good. The std of question in fastrack was harder than the actual. I cleared the exam successfully. my best recommendation would be for the head first book on pmp."
3,Good for exam preparation but full of sales pitches,"Yesterday I passed my PMP in my first attempt using primarily this book only. I have read PMP in Depth by Paul Sanghara before reading this book but that was just a heads up. I also got some free exams from some website and did two of those exams (400 questions). I have never read PMBOK because when I tried to read it was too boring. If you are preparing for PMP this is it.My only problem is that on several occasions the writer is trying to tell you how valuable her other products are and you should buy them if you really want to succeed. I normally don't rate any product so low (3 stars in this case) but I found something really annoying in chapter 10. The writer has given a question and simply refused to provide the reader with an answer and has clearly stated that you should buy ""PMP Fast Track"" if you want to know the answer to this question.Beside that the book is good."
3,Which version of PMBOK it suits?,Is this book written for the buyers who try to take the PMP Certification test based on the new 2004 yr version or the old 2000 yr version of the PMBOK?
4,Satisfied,"I am very happy with the product that I have received. I ordered on the 22nd August, 2011 and received the material on the 26th of September, 2011( approx. 1 month).....and I am in India."
5,PMP Exam Prep by Rita Mulcahey,This book and Joseph Phillips are great items to study for the PMP exam with!
3,Buy this but also get Head First PMP: A Brain-Friendly Guide,"Rita does a great job with this book. But it is apparent she is not a teacher. Her many arrogant statements will have you putting the book down for a while, so you can cool off and then get back to trying to learn the material.Her exam samples are great, but her explanations leave you wondering where the logic came from.Buy this but also getHead First PMP: A Brain-Friendly Guide to Passing the Project Management Professional Exam (Head First). Head First is a much better teaching guide an facilitates the learning process much better.Good luck..."
1,I don't get this book,"I am an avid reader & read 1 to 2 books a week. This is the first book I can remember being completely baffled over. I have put it down & restarted it for the 4th time now & can't get past page 68. There are so many typos in this book. The sentence structure is a joke. Was it not proof read? Sentences end with a preposition, the word your is used instead of you're -- to is always used instead of too, dining is spelled ""dinning"" -- For instance on page 10.... ""I'm not sure how old it is he got that when he got the bed."" Page 35 ....""heads on a sliver platter"" -- what's a SLIVER platter? This is the first time I've ever felt I really wasted money on a book!!"
5,Love it,I still love this book as much as the first one. I've heard the books go downhill the further along but this one is still very captivating.
3,Sigh...,"The book is alright, but I think the series is much better. It is intriguing how and when Elana turns, and then dosn't? Wish Smith spent more time on the back plot."
5,Great,I received this book in excellent condition nothing wrong with it at all. I even received it before I expected it as well.
4,The Struggle,Elena and Stefan are becoming closer and closer. And she's trying to avoid Damon. Anyways Caroline stole Elena's diary and is planning to read it at the Founder's Day Pagent because in it is evidence that Stefan was at the sight of the attacks that happened in Fell's Church. So they are plotting to get her diary back and Damon gets it for her. Anyway read what happens to Elena and the crew in this great book.
4,"Not the best in the series, but it ends with quite a cliffhanger","In my revised review of the first volume in this series, after I'd read the third volume, I wrote, ""Much ado has been made about Bella Swan's helpless, self-destructive behavior in Stephenie Meyer'sThe Twilight Saga Collectionseries, but Elena could wear that crown just as easily. By the end of the third book, Elena has undergone a great deal of emotional maturity in a few short weeks. She ends up becoming quite unselfish and likable."" In this, the second book in that series, Elena is still in the first round of that transformation. This isn't the best or most interesting volume in the series, but stick with it; bigger and better things are coming, and Elena is becoming a stronger character."
2,ehh not worth it,This book was boring. Seemed the whole thing was just one big scare for the main character after another and she never could save herself.
3,"I've said it before,,,","This is a lightweight enjoyable read, but nothing with great depth. My brain doesn't hang onto any wonderful story details because I'm not sure there were any. Wish the characters were more 3 dimensional. Still a fine read."
5,The Vampire Diaries Rating,I gave The Struggle 5/5 stars because I just couldnt put the book down. I had to find out what was going to happen after every turn of the page.
2,Couldn't get into this...,The characters in the book are very different from the characters on TV... and it's those characters that I like best. Sorry.
4,Great,"Loved this book, ready to start the next one! Leaves you wanting more, feeling like you have to read the next one NOW!"
5,I WANNA KEEP READING MORE,"I just started and finished reading this book and oh how I love it!L.J. Smith does such a wonderful job making you feel like your actually there.I especially loved the chemistry between Elena and Stefan,you could somehow feel what they had for each other.I especially LOVED the ending because it made me want to buy the next one to find out what happens.I'm just a beginner in reading stories by L.J.Smith and I already want MORE.I'd reccommend this book to anyone.Once you start reading it,you can't put the book down.Trust me.I know."
3,Teenager Book,We all said Stephenie Meyer's books were for teenagers... this one is for sure for them. The verbiage is teenage level... easy read though that kept me going through the end.
4,For fans of Paranormal Young Adult Stories,"If you read the first book, THE AWAKENING, this book picks up exactly where book one leaves off. One of my favorite things about this series is L. J. Smith doesn't include bits from the previous books. There is nothing to weigh this series down. So if you decide to read this series, start with book one.Stefan Salvatore is missing Elena Gilbert knows Damon, Stefan's older, has something to do with it. Both are in love with her and are as opposite as night and day. Even though Stefan is a vampire, he's kind. His brother, on the other hand, isn't. He wants to turn Elena into vamp and make her his. It's a struggle between good and evil as one brother wants to protect her while the other wants to possess her.This young adult vampire tale is a bit dark and maybe that adds to the attraction. Even though I didn't love, love this book, I liked this one better than The Secret Circle. There's more action."
2,Should be titled: Birds of Minnesota FOR BEGINNERS,"I can't understand a bird book that has only ""the top birds."" Don't we consult a bird book to identify unfamiliar ones? Well, if most birds are unfamiliar to you, this may be your book. But if you already know the basic birds, this book will be a disappointment. It has good photos, though. After I bought this book, and figured out it is for beginners (not made clear), I returned it and got Birds of MN and WI by Janssen, Tessen, and Kennedy. It's much better. (It has all the birds.)"
4,Birds of Minnesota,"Great book. I had lost my last copy and missed seeing what kind of birds came to my feeder. So, I ordered another."
5,amazing,"i was a little worried when my mom up and bought me a bird guide without even showing it to me first.(she didnt get it from amazon though, just figured i'd post a review here since im here) i was happily surprised! i spent hours after getting it looking it over. the pictures are great the information clear and its easy to find what youre looking for. i especially like how it gives tips on how to attract birds that do visit peoples yards to your own yard. everything is neatly organized. i was surprised though to learn that some of the birds we see dont behave the way theyre aparently suposed to, the information IS great though. i loved learning interesting facts about the different birds, and i havent even read it all yet! lol. it has a nice section in the back where you can check off the birds youve seen if you want. it describes pretty much everything you'd want to know. i would reccomend it ^.^"
3,Birds of Minnesota Field Guide,"This journal contains mostly the common birds - I was hoping for a more comprehensive listing, but for a small size book it's okay."
4,Good Book,So far I like this book. You can quickly look up and find which birds are visiting your feeders. Has nice pictures and info on alot of birds.
4,Bratz Genie Magic Bottle,"This is really cute, but my daughter has hardly used the magic bottle part. In essence, not worth the total I paid for it. I should have found a Katia doll instead. Quite a few little pieces too!"
1,"OK for beginners, no-good for all others.","I was very suprised to hear Haney name wrong body parts (""brachialagis"" instead of brachialis...)and giving out inaccurate info such as stating that negitive movements ""will elongate muscles"" and saying the dreaded ""side laterals"" (side-side??) instead of lateral raise. Therefore I think the video may give a little bit of introductory info to a beginner but totally lack any use to the intermediate or advanced strength trainer... SAVE YOUR MONEY!!"
5,Excellent Book for Scrupulous Catholics,In a question and answer format Father Santa answers many dilemmas posed by the scrupulous mind. Are our thoughts sins? What is a mortal sin and could I be guilty of it? What should I confess and what is okay not to. I found it very helpful in my own spiritual walk.
4,Good fridge -- terrible packaging,"As of January 10, 2007, Sanyo is still using the same terrible packaging. I'm in Amazon Prime and paid the small extra amount for next-day delivery. The fridge arrived in a torn box with shredded styrofoam packing falling out of it. The unit has a big dent on the side in the back but is working like a champ. It has very usable, well-organized space inside, and so far it keeps everything ice-cold when set a couple of notches below ""max."" It's very quiet -- it sits right behind my chair at my desk in a very quiet office, and I don't even notice when the compressor kicks on unless I'm getting something out. Good product for a decent price, IF it arrives in one piece. Geez, Sanyo, get your act together; it's just some styrofoam and a box."
3,flimsy packaging,"I read reviews citing Sanyo's horrible packaging, but decided to take the risk and bought this anyway. Well, lo and behold, the package was dented (looked manhandled), but otherwise the unit was fine. It's pretty quiet except when the motor's running, and even then, it's not that bad, you just need to let the sound ""grow on you"". This is a good fridge for a dorm (what I'm using it for), it keeps everything cold and the freezer is solid, just wish it was full-width instead of just half."
5,Arrived safe. works perfect. (July 2007),"I didn't know what to think after reading reviews here but I crossed my fingers and purchased one based on a consumer reports article I read.It arrived at my workplace in perfect condition from UPS. (If DHL delivers anything from Amazon, I politely refused delivery based on a history of broken microwaves, etc)..It was out of the box in minutes (light enough for one person and my middle age muscles).. and it was COLD in 1-1/2 hours, not overnight like some cheaper fridges close to $100 range.If the door is open for a minute (like when I stock it woth cokes and red bull, it still gets cold again quick. My old fridge (Avanti?) let sandwiches get warm if you had the door open for a minute and it took overnight to chill.It is very quiet and does not seem cycle too much. I like the reversible door."
2,Do a better job of packaging!!!,"Product itself works great. Exactly what I wanted. 4 1/2 stars for that...however, I got it with about 3 or 4 different HUGE dents. I would have returned it, but didnt want to bother going thru that whole return process. Sad thing is most reviews I read mentioned the same thing. Thought I would be the lucky one...Sanyo needs to be informed to rectify this situation. The 2 stars is for the packaging."
4,great,"the price was great,i tried it with canon xi4000 printer and its great as described, ,for sure i would recommended for a friend"
1,awful! splotchy ink,received paper in a damaged box-no response from vendor when notified that box was received broken open and mangled. photos are splotches of color-totally unlike those done on glossy paper. would not recommend product after spending hours researching and finding paper source. do not waste your money.
5,"pure, unalloyed pleasure","I had no idea before listening to this what wit and timing Durante had. The song titles alone, like ""I'll Never Forget the Time I Read a Book"" or ""I'm a Vulture for Horticulture,"" are enough to make me smile. This goes on the shelf beside Louis Jordan as one of my first recourses on down and out days."
3,Not a memorial from the period of his best-known work.,"The album was a disappointment to me. I recalled the wonderful choral arrangements I had heard in the days of my youth (late 1940s, early `50s) and wanted to hear again. This album precedes those days by at least ten years. Recorded from 1928 through 1932, the album contains ""20 Hot Hits"" from Waring's stint as a big band with choral group. The genre is big band jazz with vocals. While well remastered, the audio quality reflects the recording technology of the day. Outstanding for that period, perhaps, but not the work for which he became so well known. Not in MY memories, at least."
4,For every Dentistry Students,This book provides the most modern concepts of oral microbiology in a simple and concise manner for all students of Dentistry and professionals.
1,dementor,This toy is a disgrace and a embarrassment for us dementors. We think that J.K. Rowling made a better discription of us. We shall be showing up in your department store sooner than you think. (how do we know this? We saw a Muggle-child playing with this item telling his friends that it was a dementor)
1,Immediate failure,"The hose comes without any kind of manual or instruction, so you'll have to figure out how to use all the connectors on your own. This is a minor issue. No warranty or manufacturer information either. This is more serious. Finally - the major problem. The hose broke after one week of use. Obviously, this kind of hose cannot be repaired.Stay away from this one, and all the flat hoses in general."
2,Almost exotica,"This collection of short stories fails to live up to its title. The stories are more snapshots than narratives, and the sexual content is strangely stilted and repetitive. The afterword describing the process behind the work is good, but the work does not, ultimately, display any of the real emotional issues that prompted Newport to write in the first place."
3,Doesn't really live up to the title,"Ok, maybe I was looking for something a bit more steamy...but come on! This book has wonderful short stories about Lesbians...but calling the book Exotica and classifying it as such is close to false advertising."
5,Excellent book,"I didn't think erotica like this exisited. The stories are powerful, full of twists and very honest. I can only think to say that the stories were raw and polished at the same time. I never felt cheated or cliched like with a lot of erotica these days. The ""Stories Behind the Stories"" section is a very interesting treat -- I was curious to know so many of the stories were true."
4,Not Typical Brown But Entertaining Just The Same!,"""The Switch"" by Sandra Brown is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon. Not your typical Brown write, but nontheless enjoyable.Twins, Murder, Romance and Suspense will have the reader swiftly turning the pages.The characters are beleivable, the dialogue sharp, and the plot intriguing, but a little farfetched, but even so, I found it most entertaining.John SavoyC.E.O. & Financial AdvisorSavoy InternationalMotion Pictures"
3,Brown NOT At Her Best,"This is the most disappointing Sandra Brown book I've read. It's as if she wrote this book without an outline. I had the whole cliche plot figured out by 1/4 way through the book and I felt bored as I dragged myself through the rest of it. (The only reason I finished it was because I had to for a book report, otherwise I would have tossed it!) The love interest wasn't believable. It seemed as if ""Chief"" was still in love with Melina's dead twin and no love interest even began to develop with Melina until the book was almost finished! It was rushed as if the love plot was a last thought and it wasn't believable at all. I love Sandra Brown and her writings but this didn't do it for me. In fact, because this was so disappointing, I'll probably pass on her novels for awhile. My advise, don't waste your time and money with this one. It'll just be a major let down."
3,Good but....,"While I did enjoy this book, I can't help but wonder what happened to the Sandra Brown who wrote French Silk, The Alibi and Unspeakable? Those were REAL page turners!"
2,What happened when you know who's your foe?,The plot is good but the problem is that when you know who's the bad guy it gets boring because you know when the investigation is on the right track and when not. SB is a good writer and I really don't know why she made this blunder -as she likes to write in non-usually-common-words.
1,For me it was her worst.,"Normally a Sandra Brown fan, I found this one low on plot and longer than it had to be. The chemistry between Melina and Chief was destroyed by his bedding her twin. Try any of her other books, not this one."
1,Don't bother,"I've red lots of Sandra Brown romance novels but this was the first time I read one of her mystery/romance novels. Needless to say, I was highly dissapointed with this book. The romance and mystery was not exciting, and the plot, of course, is highly predictable. What disturbed me the most was the man, Chief, didn't mind being with both twin sisters. Don't even bother with this one."
3,Only for those intrigued by twins switching plot,"I don't really know how to rate this book. On one hand once it started I didn't want to put the book down. It hooked me right away. On the other hand, I really didn't like the story - and the conclusion was even worse.In all fairness, I would never have read this book based on the description on the back cover. I gave it a chance because I've read many other Sandra Brown books and loved them all except her very old ones.Essentially, I think that anyone who is intrigued by the summary will enjoy this book. Anyone who is initially turned off by a man being attracted to the twin sister of a woman he slept with hours before she was murdered probably won't enjoy the book, despite a conclusion that tries to explain that away."
2,the ending a surprise??,"I don't understand how the ending could have been a surprise. It was so predictable. How could Melina know the name and address of the killer if she wasn't at the restaurant and never went to the clinic. All Chief said about him was that he worked at Waters and had glasses. She then calls the clinic and asks for him by name? From that point on, the ending was so obvious and all other hints seemed ridiculous. I even guessed about Chief's father. The only surprise was the hystertomy which didn't add much to the thriller."
4,Not bad for those new to Sandra Brown,"As a first time reader of Sandra Brown I found the book pretty good. It's an enjoyable, leisurely read for those just looking to unwind a little and be able to put a book down whenever. The story was overall interesting. The only annoyance I really couldn't forget was the repetitive use of some words and phrases. I guess on that front, maybe I should agree with others that the book was a little too long."
3,The Switch,"Melina Lloyd offers her twin sister Gillian the opportunity of a lifetime in order to get her mind off being artificially inseminated recently. As a media consultant, she offers to let Gillian go in her place to a reception with none other than astronaut Christopher Hart. Melina was supposed to be his escort, but thought Gillian needed the distraction. Little did they know, but that night would change their lives forever.This is an earlier book by SB, but it distinctly displays her promise as a suspense writer. Interesting twist on twins, and an old game of switching places. Strong characters interwoven in a good story make this one you don't want to miss."
1,Awful!,The plot was dreadful. The story line was ridiculous and the dialogue was mediocre. Don't waste your time.
4,Brilliantly mysterious.,"Gillian and Melina Lloyd are identical twins. As children, a favorite game was to switch identities. Now one of the twins is found brutally murdered, after spending an evening out with a famous astronaut, Christopher ""Chief"" (for his Indian blood) Hart. It's much more than meets the eye here, as the remaining twin claims to have switched with her sister that particular evening, playing the switch game for the first time ever as adults. The remaining twin is devastated; sure the murder was meant to be her. As the plot gels, and the murder becomes more and more intricately weaved with a possible conspiracy of enormous proportions, so does the question arise: Who really is who? The story is brilliantly written by Sandra Brown, quick to clasp the reader's interest, a little slow at times, but eventually fantastically brought together in a smashing ending that will leave you reeling."
3,Want the old Sandra Brown back.,"In case you read these reviews Ms. Brown, could you write another romance novel for your diehard romance fans like me? You are the best! I don't enjoy the murder and mayhem in your latest books."
2,Disappointed,"I've been a big fan of Sandra Brown since her Harlequin days and was thrilled when she started writing romance/mysteries. However, I have been very disappointed in her last 3 books so I looked forward to reading The Switch hoping for a change. I am still disappointed. Although it had all the prerequisites for a good story I felt it lacked depth. We really never get to know the characters despite all the soul searching they seem to go through. I also found the resolution somewhat trite.Overall a disappointing read. If you must read all her books, wait for the paperback!"
2,Very Predictable!,"I found this one to be very predictable! I don't ususally come up with the ending until very close to the end. But, with this one, I figured it out right off the bat! It was too easy!It was an okay read, but very easy to figure out."
2,Not one of my favorites of hers....,"I like SB and enjoy many of her books, but this is not one of them. The subject content of this book will turn many people off, and parts of reading it have a dirty, sleazy feel to it that is uncomfortable. The storyline is also a bit far-fetched, and is confusing at times. Why are these twins switching places as adult women? Isn't it a bit juvenile to still be doing that? SB has written about twins before, in another book called ""Thursday's Child"" and that was dreadful. Advice to SB: Don't write about twins anymore."
5,Brown does it again... and again we want more!!!,I loved this book. I checked it out from the library and read it in 2 days. I have always been a fan of Brown. Gillian and her sister was a hoot and to join them for a bit in there crazy lives. I loved it. Great read for by the pool or beach.
2,The Switch,"I usually read Ms Brown's novels in one or two days. Just for weekend entertainment. This book read as quickly as the others but felt wanting.This book is not nearly up to the par of ""The Alibi"". I don't feel that the plot was very firmly developed. The resolution came too quickly and felt 'thrown together'. The character development was shallow. The 'twist' ending was entertaining however."
1,I should keep my vow to give up Brown,"I can accept the switch of identity, even though there had absolutely no reason for the switch (for what, for Gillian's celibration for the artifical insemination). But how can you accept the switch of place staying over the night, just because it was 2-3 at night, Melina, after listening to what fun Gillian had, and insisting her sister leave her home and staying at her house. I was also do not understand why Melina staying at Gillian's house at the first place, just to receive the Ruby pendant?I'll saveing my money and time for keeping my vow to give up Brown."
3,"Some Good Twists, But a Bit Hollow!","While I enjoy Sandra Brown and will continue to read her novels, I did feel like I was caught between a dime romance novel and a real mystery writer's novel in this particular storyline--The Switch.A lot of the writing struck me as a bit over the edge--contrived, and reality was completely lacking in some areas. That being said, the premise was a great one and the idea was inventive and not overdone. However, overall, I would have preferred a few more blemishes on the characters and more chill, less thrill and less of a feeling that I was looking at a hyped-up soap-opera.There were some nice twists and turns, but I was anxious to get to the end, so I could find something more substantial to read. Too much butter on the popcorn, Sandra. I would rather use my own imagination than have everything so set up for me. It just wasn't a thinking woman's suspense novel, in my opinion."
3,The Switch less than electrfying....,"The book started well, though there was no 'mystery' as to who was behind all the mayhem. I had two basic problems with the story, one was the length, it was repetive so that the last quarter of the book I found myself skimming. The second item has to do with the love triangle. Ms. Brown wants you to believe Chief (actually thats a third item I didn't like, that name for an American Indian character)falls for both sisters--I thought that was creepy. I have read numerous other books by Sandra Brown that I enjoyed from cover to cover, this is not one of them. <Ree-views>"
1,This is not the Sandra Brown of old,"I always enjoyed Sandra Brown's novels. They were steamy, sensuous and very entertaining. Her ""Slow Heat in Heaven"" was unbelievable - a real ten - but in the last few years, she seems to have gone the route of churning out one after the other of mindless, boring novels.Come back Sandra Brown - give your loyal fans what they loved and helped you become famous for."
3,"Excellent plot, but unappealing characters","I really like the plot. It's suspenseful, adventurous, and well-paced. I never would have guessed the twist at the end. It's a welcoming surprise. However, in retrospect, the reasons underlying the characters' actions are farfetched and hard to believe. Also, I don't like the leading characters. The female lead, although smart, strong and independent, is too aggressive toward her love. The male lead doesn't think before he acts for most of the time. Somehow I just can't form the links between me and the characters, which is why I only give this novel three stars."
1,Stilted and artificial,This book is an unfortunate combination of predictable plot twists and Harlequin-like romance. Not many surprises or much character development.
2,Flat............,"If you are familiar with this author, you'll be able to guess most of what happens in this novel. Once again she wrote about religious fanatics. I'm curious to know why she is so obsessed with these people. She should write a book about that!In THE SWITCH the characters weren't overly likeable or dislikeable and neither was the story. Brown has a gift for keeping the reader guessing from chapter to chapter, but in this novel her attempts fell flat. The story was too predictable and the clues were easy to pick up on, you'll definitely figure it out. Unfortunately, I wasn't buying the romantic angle of the novel either. For reasons I cannot say without giving something away.If you're a Sandra Brown fan, you might enjoy this book. It's a quick read and an interesting idea. I think it would have been much more interesting without the religious fanatic angle. I'm so sick of it."
3,Good but not quite good enough,"I must say that although this was a good read, It was not up to par of what I have come to expect from Sandra Brown. I have been an avid reader of SB books for years now and her books are the ones I eagerly look forward too. This book was no exception. However once I read it, I was quite disappointed. It lacked her usual flair for romance and she failed to capture the depth of her characters. The plot was not as suspenseful as her other books either. It was a passable read but I hope she returns with a book the packs a little more punch."
4,The Switch is just that...,"Glad to see Brown writing more thrillers instead of her cheesy all-fluff romance novels. This one was a little predictable, but good."
4,Fun escapism,"This was a book that draws you in from the beginning. I had not read this author before, but enjoyed the book immensely (after my previous book being a sappy romance predictable novel). Mystery, plot, and just interesting characters make it worth your time. Some story lines were predictable, while a good many were not. I really enjoyed reading this one. It passed the sure sign of a good book--keeping me up later at night just to get in a few more pages!"
3,Good But I Have Read Better,"Don't get me wrong I like Sandra Brown Switch but not like other books like Alibi,Witness, Exclusive was much better. ending was good but twins switch was too easy. But I will continue to be a Sandra Brown fan."
3,The Doubleswitch,"The Doubleswitch may have been a more accurate if too revealing title. I listened to this book on tape and enjoyed it. I am not so sure I would have liked reading it as much. There seemed to be a lot of times I was thinking ""come on already, is something else going to happen here or what?"" I had some trouble with the timing. It seemed like Chief and (the assumed)Molina were really getting a lot of things done in like...2 days. Anyway..it's worth a listen if you find it for rent somewhere."
5,The Swtich by Sandra Brown,"The Switch is a murder mystery revolving around twin sisters. Identical twins, Gillian and Melina Lloyd switched identities the night of Gillian's murder.Melina is a media escort and is worried about the man Gillian is seeing. Trying to get her to date others, she switches places with her sister and Gillian escorts NASA astronaut colonel Christopher ""Chief"" Heart to the dinner planned in his honor. The next morning, Melina is told, Gillian has been murdered.Melina doesn't believe the police are doing everything possible to bring her sister's killer to justice. She begins her own investigation. ""Chief"" was so taken with Gillian that he stays on in the city to help Melina solve the crime. The story shows the never-ending bond between twins and has an unexpected twist at the end."
3,A Good Effort,"I recently just read Sandra Brown's The Switch and was only half way happy with it. I am a Sandra Brown fan, my favorite-Best Kept Secrets, and read all her books. This book seemed to me like it did not focus enough on her characters. I just didn't seem to get any idea of who they really were. It seemed to me like they were flat and one dimensional. I liked her twin switch plot and thought that she could have really had something great if only the characters were more believable and real. I like that she has become more of a thriller writer, but I think that in her effort to become one she is missing some of the other imporant parts of telling a good story. I rate this book three stars because I did finish it and I think it was okay, but it had the potential of being much better."
3,Don't read this if you want to keep the end a mystery!,"I was very disappointed with the double switcheraroo at the end, which made the entire plot become unbelievable. We are supposed to believe that one twin would actually take on the identity of the other twin simply to find the murdered twin's killer? That would mean arranging and attending your own funeral! Isn't that kind of macabre, having your own mourners attend your sister's funeral? That seems unfair to the murdered twin. I didn't understand the need for the final switch. There was no point. I thought it would have been more interesting to have Chief realize that although his one night with Gillian was great, it really was Melina that he had come to love because of her intelligence and bravery. Although it was well written, as all Sandra Brown's books are, this one left too many overlooked holes and unrealistic behavior."
2,"Interesting idea, but...","While the premise of the plot was interesting and original, I found the story let me down. The characters, presented as extremely intelligent and strong, continue to do and say idiotic things that just don't make sense. Certain plot twists are very contrived and over the edge. As I listened to the book on unabridged audio, I kept thinking to myself, ""She'd never do that or say that"" and in the end, it still didn't make sense. Basically, while the story was interesting, I just didn't buy it as believable in any way."
1,Artificial and contrived,The premise of this book is that a set of twins switch places one evening and as a result one of the twins is murdered. The premise is patently unbelievable and strained to it's limits; the dialogue between characters is artificial and contrived. The author uses language which sends you running to the dictionary to figure out what on earth she means since much of it is unheard of and taken out of context; as a result the characters are cold and unsympathetic. No basis for empathy for the surviving sister (Melina) exists. Don't waste the money for this book.
2,My first foray into the world of Sandra Brown,"I wasn't terribly impressed. The plot twist at the end made me go back and reread some parts that seemed unbelievable. Either I read too quickly of the images that I was left with at the begining of the bookd were purposefully misleading to get to the ending.I also did not understand Chief and his tortured self. If he were that tortured/conflicted internally, do you think he would have survived in the military/space program?"
2,"So, That's It?","I was real disappointed in this novel. Sandra Brown is one of my favorites, however, The Switch was disappointing. I thought the characters were very vague. The only thing that did surprise me was in the end, regarding the twins, even then, I felt that I was hanging still wondering about certain things. I felt there was no definite closure on this novel. This novel needed much more detailed accounts of everything. In my opinion, Brown did not think all the way through on this one or even left certain things out that really needed to be there. Even though alot of thriller/mystery writers want to leave you hanging, there was to much missing in this story. I will not let this one ruin my confidence in Brown on future books though. I have read many of her novels and have loved them."
2,Predictable,"I've only read two of Sandra Brown's books (the other being Standoff) and I thought this one was pretty bad. I never saw what everyone else thought was so bad about Standoff; I thought it was pretty good. This one was just plain stupid. It starts off good, building the characters and the plot quite well. But then, about halfway through, it changes form from clever thriller to stupid soap opera. Personally, I saw the ending coming from the beginning, but that's not to say everyone will. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book! If you're dying to read it, rent it at the library. You'll be glad you did!"
2,Punch heads are not very durable,"I've had this unit for about 6 weeks and it worked well until a head broke today. I called the company thinking that 6 weeks was a little premature and they told me that the unit has a lifetime warranty on everything except the head and that the heads that cost $53.59 for a set of 3 should be replaced approximately every 100 punches. Had I known that I would not have purchased this unit. That is a very considerable addition to the cost of printing that was not disclosed anywhere pre-purchase. Furthermore, $53.59 is crazy, I was expecting them to say $6 or $7 for a set of 3. Yes when it's not broken it works fine, but they need to be more honest about the cost of operating this unit. Had it said anything about that in the description I'd give the unit a 5 but since they ignore it and pretend it isn't an issue they get a 2 and I really should give it a 1."
3,Starting to malfunction,"Purchased this punch in March. Great initially. Now one of the holes doesn'tpunch all the way through and it's necessary to remove the punches from insideall three holes. I feel it should be funtioning well after eight months, sonow I wouldn't recommend it if you do a lot of punching."
3,"Mentally ill people are not ""Blue""","Breggin does offer a much-needed and hard hitting vision of comtempory psychiatry and its love affair with quick fix drugs and easy money. The criticism of psychiatry from an insider is crucial to all involved with mental illness. Where the book falters, however, is in its answer to mental illness. To compare somebody suffering from severe depression to a dog left alone for a few days (""Sometimes our dog 'Blue' gets depressed when we leave him alone for a few days. But after love and reassurance, he's back to himself"") is insulting, oversimplified, and greatly undermines what Breggin might have to say about mental illness. It does not take an expert to realize that a pat on the head will not suffice for somebody who is in a deep depression. The criticism of psychiatry is sound, but unless Breggin has more enlightened ideas about mental illness and those who suffer from it, he will not help anyone."
5,Breggin Manifesto,"Although this book is written at a 4 star level, the subject matter is so important that it rates the highest recommendation. The biological bias of psychiatry is so pervasive, the pharmaceutical approach so dogmatic, that abuses in the medical establishment are running rampant. A book like this raises (and cannot answer) the question, How are psychiatrists and other physicians really different from street drug dealers when tranquilizing and artificial mood alteration are the name of the game? Breggin cites an impressive list of research and scrutiny to refute the scientism backing the established approach. His concern for children is foremost in evidence. While a complete abolishment of psychiatric medication would be precipitous in some cases such as mania or suicidal depression, an industry-wide caution is much needed for the reasons cited here."
2,Toxic psyachiatry is toxic for parents of the mentally ill,"I was going to assign this book to my students in my Abnormal Psychology class... The first chapter is powerful and true. However, this author irresponsibly attacks the parents of the mentally ill as responsible for their children's illnesses!!!! He also attacks NAMI, the National Association of the Mentally Ill, an organization that has helped more mentally ill patients recover, find support and their way to a successful and meaningful life, and has truly educated more people about mental illness than Breggin has ever done himself, I am sure. The good points the book makes about inadequate and even harmful psychiatric care in mental institutions are, in my opinion, obfuscated by his unwarranted attacks on parents -- attacks, I believe, that may be a result of his old-fashioned psychoanalytical training."
1,Flawed Philosophical Rhetoric,"As a behavioural neuroscientist I was appalled by the extreme and unscientific rhetoric expressed by this individual. The fear-mongering nature of this read provides an extremely biased point-of-view by throwing psychiatric techniques at the reader that are either out-of-date or have been changed to better the patient(s) involved. A mental state is a DIRECT result of a particular brain state, and therefore, a disturbed continual mental state creating dysfunction in the individual must be a result of altered neurochemicals and must be corrected through proper medications. If the author knew anything of neuroscience and psychiatry he would understand that medications AND psychotherapy are the best combination, and not one alone."
1,This book is essntially trash,"The writer has all the credentials but this book demonstrates the level of his ignorance. Oh, yeah, love should be the solution to all of medicine. Let's stop giving cancer patients chemo because the drugs are, toxic. In fact, the effect size of cancer drugs in the treatment of cancer is more than likely much lower than that of psychiatric drugs. We should BAN all cancer drugs then. It amazes me some publisher would actually publish a book like this.By the way, yes, he was trained at Harvard and in fact one of the best residency programs in the country at the time. But when he was in training, it was ALL psychoanalysis! It may or may not surprise you that psychiatrists of his generation-I mean many of them, don't know a bit, I mean a tiny bit, about the brain. So yes, he is a Harvard-trained psychiatrist, but it DOES NOT qualify him to discuss issues that he has no clue on, such as things or drugs that have to do with the brain."
5,It's the truth rarely spoken,"This book should be in every library and in every home. It is unusual to find a psychiatrist willing to state the facts about his own chosen profession. Near the end of his book Breggin says, ""Psychiatry will fight to the bitter against any kind of reform. To this day, it resists even the slightest control over its most abusive practices such as state mental hospitals, involuntary drugging, electroshock and lobotomy, and it fights every attempt to increase patients rights."" The book describes known problems with the various minor and major tranquilizers and mood altering drugs as well as ECT, electroconvulsive therapy. The book will be useful to parents and others as a reference, if not pleasant reading. Ones conclusions should be that psychiatry is to be avoided to the extent possible. One must assume responsibility for ones own behavior and there are less harmful alternatives to psychiatry."
5,"a must read for anyone seeking psychiatric ""help"".","a man loses his job, his wife leaves him and takes the kids, he starts to lose it so he loses his job, what's the psychiatric answer- have a gang of police jump him, strap him to an ambulance where he's taken to a place where going out for a cigarette is called a ""priveledge"" and psychiatric personel come at him with brain damaging drugs which he's forced to take by order of the courts. Now there's an answer. Get them while they're vulnerable! If you are ever seeking psychiatric help, please read this book before you do. Getting involved with these people will be the worst mistake you'll make in your life. Try the vitamin store for natural solutions if you feel you need something. Brain damage, believe me, is not what you're looking for."
3,The fringe of psychiatry,"Before I criticize this book, it should be said that Breggin really seems to care about psychiatry and wants to help people. That said, this book is a little bit loony- Breggin has taken such an extreme stance against biochemical treatment of mental illness that he almost can't be taken seriously. He's so far from objective, that eventually the discerning reader may just stop listening. I suppose people should read this book anyway, as it may change their perspective a bit. I just think Breggin would be more credible if he didn't force his way into such a ridiculously extreme position. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Bought this product a few weeks ago. Took it out of the box today, turned it on, and it started smoking the second the power was turned on. Naturally the time has expired to get a refund on it. Don't waste your money on this item. The motor was burned up before it ever came out of the box."
5,MORE ROCK THAN BLUES,"I just bought this a couple of weeks ago, I finally got the chance to sit down and watch it. Wow what a mind blower, this young man (18 at the time) plays and sings with the conviction of a veteran artist. His guitar playing skills are superb, along with his vocals. This is a must for blues or rock fans, he comes off as very much in control of his game. The other guitarist is no slouch either, he also does some fantastic solos. The drummer is excellent along with his bass player, his band is very tight and of very high quality. The songs are all great, they were good choices for this show. The DTS surround adds a lot to the enjoyment of the show, this is one I bought after reading other reviews. The other reviewers hit the nail on the head with this one, just buy it you will love it."
4,Jonny Lang; Live at Montreux,"A good performance by Jonny and his old band. Why he chose to omit his signature song "" I Am "" is beyond me. I've seen him perform numerous times over the years and that song is usually saved for the encore. Too bad it was left out of this DVD."
5,Please get this item back in stock!,"For all of us Jonny Lang lovers out there...we all know that Jonny does not have any official DVDs, except for this one. I am sure it is a great concert but we'll never know if it's not in stock. Amazon, do your best to get it back! Thanks!"
2,Just a DVD,I saw him on the Jay Leno show and I liked his performance very much. I understand that this DVD was from 10 years ago but I was still a bit disappointed.
3,Johnny Lang,"Having watched him for the first time with Eric Clapton and friends in the second cross roads DvD, it was a case of searching the web to look for one of his DvD's and this is great."
1,DVD is unwatchable,"My rating does not apply to the story/movie ""Against a Crooked Sky"". How you rate the story/movie is subjective to you. Personally, I've always felt it was a great family movie. However, the movie mastered to this DVD edition is absolutely awful. It's so poorly done that it is unwatchable. It looks like a bad, smeary vhs copy. Picture is dull and lacks detail and sharpness. I tried to watch for a few minutes but ended up tossing this into the trash. I may try again with a different DVD from another DVD mastering company."
3,Didn't hold my interest,"While there is good information in this book, it failed to hold my interest. It read more like a technical manual than a how-to. In addition, there was a lot more in it about publishing a downloadable ebook than about Print-On-Demand (which happens to be what I was looking for). If you want a step-by-step about how to put a downloadable PDF book together, this would help."
2,"A book for beginners, or even non investors","The 100 ways are actually elaboration of 100 adages of diverse sources from JKF's ""How could I have been so mistaken as to have trusted the experts?"" to Pope John XXIII's ""See everything, overlook a great deal, correct a little"".Some sayings are interesting. Most are quite mediocre, like ""Buy low, sell high"" ""In the long run, it's earnings growth that drives the stock.""I bet that most of the experienced investors or traders, who have read more than two trading books, will be disappointed by this one."
5,Porter Cable 5500 watt generator,"This generator proved to be a life saver this year when IKE came barreling down and slammed into the Texas coast. We were without power for a little over 11 days and I ran the generator 24/7 except for twice when I changed the oil in it. To say it was quiet would be a lie however for the comfort that it provided it was well worth the noise factor. I had plugged in all at one time were the following. One 110 ac/window unit, a chest freezer, the refrigerator, the televison x2 the satellite box. Four fans, and three or four lights I ran it hard and long a couple of times you could tell I was right on the edge of the wattage however she pulled though with flying colors. So basically it ran loaded up over 240 hours and I would trust it to do it again. Best money spent in a long time. Great to see a good product again that did not make me go broke buying it."
3,question,do their arms bend??? or do they come down from holding their hips or are there stiff and just stay there.
5,Cool,"I don't own these dolls, but I like them so I gave them five stars. There is a problem with the titling though. If you type in Bratz Sisters and or Sisterz on the Search bar you'll get the older version of these dolls (the ones that I'm reviewing) as twins named Nita and Nora even though one is unmistakably older. But if you go to them as kids, they're wearing the same clothes, but the youngest one has it in Bratz Babyz form and the oldest one has it in Bratz Kidz form. They look the same just younger. Plus their names are Kiana and Lilani I believe that's how you spell them! And in stores on the back of the box for the older ones Amazon call twins, they say Sisterz as well as the Bratz website. Oh well, they're still something new, and as always, cute!"
4,Not the worst...in my opinion,"I like those sis.They are cute,but not the best.The worst twiins ever are Krysta and Lela.I saw at stores.They where soooooooo ugly.I loved Oriana and Valentina.They are the best Twiins,and so Tess and Nona.These sisters are not bad at all,but MGA could made thier eyes better.(...)BIG BRATZ FAN!!!"
4,I like it.,This set is not too bad.I think it's pretty cute.They look alot like me and my sister.End the bratz/my scene warLENZIE:)
4,Great modern day Hong Kong police thriller.,"This film won best action design at the 1997 Hong Kong film awards and it is entertaining throughout. Anthony Wong, surprisingly, plays the bad guy role once again. I reccomend the film simply for its good character developement, action, and the fact that its sync sound cantonese, a rarity in Hong Kong cinema."
4,Good action thriller with cool characters,"The characters are particularly memorable in this movie, which is saying quite a bit about the quality of this action flick. Lau Ching Wan plays a tough well-respected cop who gets demoted to the Emergency Unit (after he punched a superior) and joins with four other cops, each with very different personalities. The characters are excellent and the way they play off each other is quite endearing, dramatic, and funny. And then, there's the two evil druglord villains whom they must eventually tangle with. Action scenes are fast and furious (occasionally confusing), and story moves quite quickly. A highly entertaining movie.As for the DVD, I found it pretty okay, as there are some extra trailers of other movies which was kind of nice, although DVD didn't allow me to skip through the the studio/warning setences and stuff in the beginning."
2,One page about octopuses,"A trivial overview of sea creates with camouflaging abilities, and not much to say even about them. And the poetry is awkward. My 4 four year old gets bored with this one quickly."
4,Northwest Women,"As a native of Western Washington I enjoyed this book. Not only for the local history, but for the story of a woman. She was a woman who could have played cards and held tea parties, but she chose to use her brains, and money, to bring quality television to the Northwest. I, and many other baby boomer children, benefited from the efforts. Dorothy reinvented herself after the deaths of her father, brother and husband. It's a profile in courage, to borrow a JFK book title."
2,Dorothy Stimson Bullitt: An Uncommon Life,"For anyone interested in the early ""movers and shakers"" of Seattle and particularly in the woman who built the first broadcasting empire between San Francisco and Minneapolis, this book will prove useful. Dorothy Stimson Bullitit's successful competition--without any previous business training--against the broadcast giants, her striving for higher standards in TV programming and her support of educational television and classical music radio all make her worthy of a biography. While the minutae of domestic details about her early life in Seattle's high society may interest some, to devote almost half the book to the period before her love affair with broadcasting began does slow the pace. Although it is obvious that the writer knew and admired her subject, the biography would have benefited from the writer being more selective in her details and aiming for a more objective interpretation."
5,My sons favorite blanket,This blanket is so soft and colorful!!!! My son loves Thomas and gets so excited to get in bed and see his blanket. It is perfect size for a toddler bedspread and is great size for a two year old to drag around the house. This was a great purchase!
3,"Super soft, but smaller than expected",I bought this blanket for a 3 year old. The blanket is super soft but it's a little smaller than expected. The kiddo loves it and always has it when he comes over to my house!
4,fishing fun,this is a good rod for fishing. it makes small fish feel like a big fish with the play. great for kids who want to feel like they are catching a really big fish.
5,Review by Adult,I had one as a child and it is just how I remember it! It is a perfect Tamagotchi in every way and really reminds me of what it is like to take care of a pet. I play with it all the time now to get that feeling of the child within myself. This one does have an on/off switch which is perfect for when I am at work/university. I adore my little Tamagotchi and with continue to use it!
1,Disappointing for a true Tebow fan,"This documentary was a major disappointment for someone who is a true Tebow fan. There was no new information, no new stories, and there weren't even any interviews with Tim, his family, or those closest to him. There were interviews with a couple reporters, a high school football teammate and assistant coach, amongst others. It seemed as if the film company didn't have rights to use a lot photos or video of Tim as there were actors pretending to be Tim playing football. My husband and I have followed Tim for years and were excited that there was a new video, however we almost had to laugh at how bad it was. Glad we only spent $7 on this. I guess you get what you pay for though!"
2,Boring,Seemed redundant. Would like to have heard more interview from the person who the movie was made about. Seemed that it was mostly just people talking about Tim Tebow. There wasn't much footage of him in the movie at all.
5,Couldn't put it down,"I don't read books that often and when I picked this one up, I couldn't put it down. I especially enjoyed the twists and turns in the story and the potentially dangerous situations that the main character boldly pushed his way through. I read some of the other reviews, concerning being disappointed about the excitement of the ending. My feeling is the opposite! This book is ripe for a sequel and I left the last chapter excited and wondering about the next book to come. Life isn't always wrapped up in tidy complete sentences. Indiana Jones too, rode off into the unknown. Enjoy the book and look forward to the anticipation of his next adventure...it is in his blood. My wife read the book, as soon as I put it down, and enjoyed it so much, she suggested we buy some and give them to our friends for Christmas! We can't wait for the movie and the sequel! Keep up the good work Gil!"
4,Fun a la Elmore Leonard,"Company of Thieves is a fast-paced fun read. The plot moves right along and there are lots of twists, plus a few red herrings thrown in. It's well-written and there is actually some character development. The cover refers to Hiaasen (also a favorite) but this is much more like an Elmore Leonard book. Leonard's books are filled with people acting fairly rationally, and usually the main character survives by wit and con, not being a superman.The ending is very good, and left me wishing I could find another book with Warren Allison and more adventures...so Gil, if you read this, you have some fans.And by the way, whoever wrote the banner for the cover and the teaser paragraph didn't seem to have really read the book."
4,Like a literate 1950's horror movie...,"I had a high school literature teacher, prone in her cups to readings of Conrad Aiken and T. S. Eliot, who was the only other person I ever knew who had read this book. Oddly, it's not what anyone would call ""literary"" in the sense of vocabulary, quotation or allusion, but it seems to appeal to reflective people.On the surface, it's a mystery. Did she fall or was she pushed? (Really.) On another level, it's a novel about obsession -- the Orpheus-and-Eurydice, Gilgamesh-and-Enkidu kind of obsession that develops when someone is loved deeply and dies young. And then it's a supernatural novel, in which the events and possibilities are creepy beyond anything the circumstances depicted could account for. Sloane has a nice touch with the numinous image, and with creating the swoopy feeling of witnessing a breach out of the ordinary world. This is a little gem."
2,skip this movie,"the editing of the movie is very poor, jumping from scene to scene leaves the viewer lost. The movie waste alot of time with corny scenes like the midget chasing around the fat guy for a long timea and there are alot scenes of flying around. I could not bare watching the entire film. i wasted 7.99 plus tax on this film. skip it and get something better."
3,A deep plotted and skill rich film.,"A film showcasing many fine fights and sword techniques. A young fighter must ask for from his most hated rival, in order to bring down a crazed kung fu master before he gets out of control. I liked this alot, and I think you will to. good fighting (swords, claws, chains, and my favorite fan). A definate good by on my part I feel."
5,WE DO LIKE TO PARTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS IS A GREAT DANCE MUSIC CD IT GETS EVERYONE UP FROM THE 3 YEAR OLD TO YOUR LITTLE OLD GRAND PARENTS IT IS A GREAT TRACK SUNG BY TO HOT LADYS AND 2 ENERGETIC MEN SO DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT JUST BUY IT!!!!!
1,Should have checked it out!,With a name like Natural Source I should have know better. I called the company (now that I am on my second container)only to find out it is a synthetic source not a natural one at all. Do your homework..I am sorry I didn't It comes from DMSO!! Mine will be going in the trash. I will purchase the next tub from David Wolfe...a name I trust.
2,Amazon price is not competitive,"The product itself is great, but Amazon's price is $20-25 more than other vendors online or in stores. Even with shipping, it's cheaper to buy it from another vendor along with other Source Naturals products like Chlorella and Spirulina."
2,Judy doesn't deserve this treatment,"I am perplexed. In this day and age of tweaking 'foibles' out of old recordings, I can't help but wonder who dropped the ball, on what should have been a priceless release. Frank, Judy and Dean ~ together. The sound is so bad, it is beyond comprehension. That being said, I have to give it at least two stars, because of the songs, and the obvious admiration for the music, and each other, as these magnificent stars sing the notes.Oh, such a pity is this experience. $13.99? This should be in the bargin bin, sorry to say."
2,Judy Garland Shows IMPORT,"Ms. Garland's voice is impeccable, however , the quality of the recording is poor. I thought perhaps the CD was defective."
1,black seiko watch,The color started wearing off the band with very little use..First problem ever with a seiko watch (20 years)..love the seiko product!
5,I love my watch!!,"This watch truly is a beautiful time piece. I love the look, the quality, the value, etc. etc. I didn't buy this watch because I needed it, I bought it because I wanted it. I'm usually very hard on crystals, but this one has proven to be very scratch risistant. The reviews helped convince me of the quality. I simply love everything about this watch."
5,Awesome,This is the best watch I've ever bought. Everyone has complemented me on it. You must buy this watch!
5,Solid watch,"I'm a great fan of seiko products. I've always believed that seiko had the same caliber of quality as some swiss movements if not better, but for an affordable price. This particular watch is extremely sturdy, and you can feel it in the weight. I feel that the design is really unique and the detail is absolutely exquisite, down to the sporty design of the dial. The ""glow in the dark"" is extremely strong and visible at night. The accuracy was around 1 to 2 seconds every 3 to 4 months nothing too extreme. I would highly recommend this watch."
5,Prentice hall guide,I needed this book for an English class that I took.I don't have much to say about it.
4,Geek Charming,"This is one charming little movie for all of the family. The many lessons learned, in a delightful way, brought a bit of discussion as to why we behave the way we do...whether it be fakery, trickery, popularity, or whatever. Good little film for teaching young children and even tween-agers the importance of being yourself, diversity, and acceptance."
5,Best movie ever,I love watching good clean movies and this is one of those movies and it has a great message to share to others.I love the Best friend charm set it's so beautiful.
5,Great Video!!,I was given this video by one of my friends and didn't use it for a long time. Then I pulled it out one day to give it a try. It is one of the best workout videos I have. It doesn't require any major products and can be done in your basement. The video concentrates on using your own resistance and you can really FEEL the burn. The next day I could barely walk!! The video has a great warmup and cooldown and even though there isn't any cardio in it you really work up a sweat. I reccomend this video to everyone. Cory rocks!!
3,In the middle,"I have to come down in the middle here. I didn't think it was as bad as some people said, or as good as some others said. The general idea of more stories from the Age of Conan was good, but I didn't think this story really delivered. The biggest problem is that compared to most of the original Howard stories (mostly short stories), the plot just isn't that novel or interesting. The root of this may be that we are stuck in Cimmeria, where there just aren't that many beautiful princesses in silks or evil sorcerers in black around. On the plus side, the fight scenes were exciting and for some I was literally on the edge of my seat. I guess I will try one or two more of the Age of Conan series and see if the other stories/characters are more exciting. Frankly, there are probably very many Conan stories left to tell without trying to invent new characters - Howard mentions so many things Conan did that I don't remember seeing in stories (Kozak chief on the steppes, or whatever)."
4,Unique additon to the Conan Saga,"I have been reading Robert E. Howard for 23yrs now and own every book he wrote including the pastiches. This is a unique addition to the Hyborian Kingdom. The characters, (esp. Kern), have enough of the characteristics of Robert E. Howards style to be familiar yet are not just rip-offs. Loren Coleman maintains his own style yet still carries the flavour over from the Conan adventures. His use of unique paragraph breaks create suspense within the story without leaving you hanging. I have never seen this way of writing and I have read many, many books. The paragraph ends with an uncertain outcome or one with several possibilities and the next begins as if it was present after a comma, so there is no pause in the action just that, as indicated by a paragraph break. A good read and I look forward to more in this series."
4,Great read,"Two thumbs up on this new series... though the second book is better than the first, this is a good start. Hopefully we'll see a lot more books set in the age of Hyboria.This book is not on par with the epics like Martin and Gemmell... but it's a little more involved than a Forgotten Realms or Dragonlance.Any fan of Howard, Hyboria, or Conan, will probably enjoy these books."
4,Great short read,"This book was suprisingly good. I didn't expect much and was blown away with the action described by the author. If your looking for a quick read with a good story arc, then this is your read."
3,So So,"The premis of this book had a lot of promise but unfortunately, it doesn't quite make good. Others have summarized the plot so I will not do so here. The thing that I disliked most about this novel was the main character. Katanan is so weak, lacking in personality, that it is hard to cheer for him. When he is found by his family, who attempt to train him to be a king, you can't help but think.""why bother?"". He does grow a bit of back bone near the end of the story but by then it is almost too late for the reader.The pacing of the book is also pretty poor and I think the author is trying to work with too many charas. She is clearly floundering.Still, this is not a terrible book. But I am not sure I would recommend it."
3,Pleasant but forgetable,"""The Singer's Crown"" centers on a young, eunic slave with a marvelous singing talent. His latest owner is a selfish young princess, whose family is threatened by a magical curse. The singer's past catches up with him, as you'll no doubt read on the back cover.The pace is liesurely, with descriptive prose. There is plenty of action and events, but still, the pace seems measured and with more detail than I prefer. Little magic in this book, mostly personalities and political maneuvering. The singer's attitude is formed by his status (slave) in a consistent way that I found charming; that is his place in life, and he accepts it. Overall, a pleasant read."
3,great drumming everything else mediocre,pillorys no life guard at the gene pool is a nice offering of death/grind. really supurb drumming on this record as well as good production and nice mix. the guitar is good but not anything special which is not a bad thing. the vocals is what prevents me from loving this album. too much pig squeels. never been a fan of the pig squeel and it is somewhat overpowering on this release although there are several other vocal styles used. this is a good album if your looking for brutal drums that dont sound unoriginal also if your looking for a death/grind record you havnt already heard.
4,Deborah & Peabo's Duet Lights The World For All Lovers,"Deborah Gibson & Peabo Bryson's _Light The World_ is a marriage between two powerful, soulful voices. Both vocalists are known for their passion and technical prowess, and they show those gifts well on this song. Most anyone who has ever loved can relate to this inspirational song. Have you ever been in a relationship where your friends or family do not approve? Are you in a relationship where society says is improper or wrong? Have you ever been caught in a long distance relationship? This song speaks to anyone who has ever felt the highs and lows of those moments, and shines a light on those darker times."
1,Great music ruined by poor sound quality!!!!!!!,"Because the sound quality is so poor, it's real hard to enjoy what is actually a great album from some great musicians. This sounds like it has been dubbed from an old LP and then strangely processed, rather than the proper studio tapes. Sadly, not one that I would recommend at all, to anybody."
5,Great stuff,"We have a very busy auto repair shop, recently we had a Chevrolet pick up that had lost the differential carrier bearings. When the bearing race spun it damaged the differential housing, because a used one is $500.00 and a new one was out of the question for this customer, we opt'ed to use Loctite #640 high strenth sleeve retainer repair. It did the job very well and we will use it again if we find the need."
1,Similar but hardly custom fitted...,"Bought a set of these for my Jag XJS. They were purported to be custom cut but they do not fit the foot well and have to have folds along the edges and are not fitted like originals are.Trying to make contact to anyone that cares or could do anything is impossible.Will be returning these and will get a proper set.I wonder if any other vehicles have the same issues, but seems that for my Jag, their template was off."
4,Equipment needed,"Great drills, but you do need the equipment to execute properly. Some are partner drills and then others just give you a bunch of patterns. All in all some good drills. For the price, I didn't mind buying it."
1,Not what I wanted!,The picture on the cover is the only picture in the book. Yes there are diagrams that show where to lay down the cones or line tape to perform team sport drills. This wasn't the book of exercise drills that I was hoping for. I know now to look at how many color pictures and pages the book has before I buy it. This book is meant for a coach of a large team because it had nothing but drills running back and forth around orange cones. Maybe its my fault because the book is 101 agility drills and there were differt ways to arrange cones on a field just not 101 exercise like jumping jacks or diamond push-ups or any thing better!
1,Nice piece of fiction by Albom,"As time would show, this fluff piece by Albom was fiction at its greatest height.The bits about Chris Webber not having the money to buy a hamburger must be read to be believed, since we now know that he was taking hundred thousand dollar-plus payoff from Ed Martin during his two years in Ann Arbor.It strains credulity to think that Mitch Albom could have spent all that time around the Michigan team and not noticed the players driving the fancy cars and flashing around the other signs of obvious wealth such as luxury apartments.And Mitch wonders why he has a credibility issue."
1,Unbelievable,"Mitch Albom is supposedly a newspaper writer and journalist. Yet somehow he managed not to notice the fact the subjects of this book (The Fab Five) were paid over $600,000 to attend the University of Michigan.This means that either:A. Mitch knew about the payments and therefore all the material he wrote concerning the Michigan basketball program is suspect because he was in on the coverup.ORB. Mitch didn't know about the payments and therefore all the material he wrote concerning the Michigan basketball program is suspect because he didn't even notice that the college kids he was covering were being paid over a half million dollars to play basketball."
5,The 1993 Michigan Wolverines-The greatest team ever!!,"An easy to follow book, which tells of a team acting as a team should, through thick and thin. A must have in any sports fan library. This is a story of the 1993 Michigan Wolverines, the greatest college basketball team to play the sport."
5,A Great Book!,"If anyone has ever loved the Fab Five of the Michigan Wolverines, then this book is for them. It gives a clear portrait of what it is like to play basketball for a major university. Get it!"
4,The original routines and recordings.,"Expect some static, and to miss the beginning of the routines if you are not ready immediately after pressing ""play"". Otherwise, it's all great, classic, stuff unjaded by years of re-performance."
3,Who's on First: A Collection of Classic Routines,"Well, first off, it took a long time to receive it. Then, when I got it - the cover was cracked. I bought this for my dad, so I waited until he opened it to see if it was damaged. Luckily it wasn't because if I returned, god knows how long it would have taken to get a new one.I've been happy with every purchase made on Amazon. But, of course, this one was a gift and this is the one that had problems."
4,Interesting...and enlightening,"This book introduces what humans are made of, and bonds the boundary between our feelings, and our 'flesh' side. It is good if you are interested in somewhat of a metaphysical approach, and I recommend it for anyone with the time and open mind to read it."
2,Very Disappointed,"First off, this table arrived with pieces falling out of a box that looked like it had been shipped around the world. The metal is sprayed with green enamel paint - I expected it to be black since it was described as wrought iron. The wood slats are chipped and dinged. I will have to sand and varnish them. I would have expected a price of at least half of what I paid for the quality of the table."
2,Smells good in the bottle ...,"but did very little to make anything else smell better. It has a bit of soap in it too. Well, maybe not soap, but it will make lots of bubbles if you put it in an evaporative cooler as I did. Wouldn't order it again, put it that way."
1,Still waiting for a scent,"I have used almost two complete bottles of this fragrance and have not smelled it yet. It's a really good idea, but it does not work. Save your money and buy regular air freshener."
1,Unenthralled....,"I found this DVD to be extremely disappointing. Whereas I certainly appreciate understanding the influences on Tom Waits career, I did not expect a DVD about Tom to be so absent of Tom Waits himself. The DVD does inform regarding the many artists that Tom has culled from over the years...but speaks so little about the man I was interested to watch about...Tom Waits! If you want depth, then this is good for you. However, if you want to know more about Tom, or to expose yourself to more of Tom's own musical achievements, then stick to the other review DVD's out there!"
3,"Fascinating, but irritating technical problem with the disc","It's an interesting examination of the evolution of Waits' sound and his many possible influences, but the audio on this DVD is out of sync with the video. I'm pretty sure that it's not intentional, though I wouldn't rule out a Waitsian conspiracy to sabotage an unsanctioned project. In any case, it's extremely annoying. The film is quite good -- the stuff about Harry Partch in particular -- but it's like watching a badly dubbed movie. I'd rather rip the audio and listen to it in my car."
2,Marginal at best,"After reading the reviews for this book, I eagerly purchased my copy. I am a general surgery resident and thus I thought I would find this book especially interesting. I did not. The author makes some interesting and valid observations, however I felt the book lacked any true analysis of what it really means to be a surgeon. If I were a medical student reading this I would steer clear of a career in surgery! Specifically I was annoyed by her contention that surgeons are merely clinicians and not true scientists as well as her insistence on referring to all surgeons by the male gender (a point she made early on). Clearly I am living proof of the contrary. In short, I was extremely disappointed and had a very difficult time even finishing this book."
3,Only so-so,"I found myself being sucked into this book at times, and wanting to push it away at others. The material is interesting - I had never really thought of surgeons as having their own culture. The stories were interesting and sometimes shocking. But I feel like the writer dumbed things down a little too much. . .either that or she didn't have great writing skills. And she really added too much of her commentary. I was hoping for a neutral look - a simple report on the culture of surgeons - but she tried to get the reader to agree with her views far too often. It wouldn't hurt to read this book, but it wouldn't really be an enjoyable experience either."
4,love it,"i love it , i have a winter baby and strapping a bulky coat or any coat on a tiny little thing gets in the way of belting the baby innto the car seat. We use this and then put her into the ""bundle me"" blanket, and wa'la instant warmth...no worries..when not going out we use this indoors, since it allows for feet movement but not hands...which my baby loves, otherwise she won't sleep! So we put the swaddle on and then put her in the swing (the open legs allow us to strap her in) or bouncer.."
1,"Yes, science and reason is a conspriacy!","This book is an excellent example of the paranoia that grips people who don't understand the standards of science and reason. The author could well go on to write another book on the ""conspiracy"" of the criminal justice system that keeps us all poor by cracking down on bank robbers. After all, the banks have lots of money so why shouldn't we just go there and get some whenever we want? In like fashion, sCAMsters claim they have an ""alternative"" to scientific standards of medical care and complain when they are unmasked as charlatans and frauds."
3,Pantera Wanna-Bes,"Disappointing. LD50 is better in terms of originality and variation. This disc sounds the same almost the whole way through. The singer sounds way too much like Phil Anselmo of Pantera to be interesting. Come on man, Pantera did that vocal style to death already. Some of the music is technical and interesting, but the Pantera-ish vocals really distract from the whole experience. These guys try to go over the top and end up sounding like someone else. Not a bad disc, just don't expect any ground-breaking material here (like they had with LD50)."
5,This Record and DVD Will Blow Your Mind!,"If you're a MuDvAyNe fan, then you'll appreciate everything about this record and DVD. Spend the extra cash for the Limited Edition Set - you truly won't be sorry.If you're not YET a MuDvAyNe fan, this record and DVD will make you into one. Aurally, the band shows a tremendous range - from thunderous metal to melodic heaviness. Make no mistake - this record is not a step down from previous efforts in terms of intensity. In fact, I'd have to say that, taken as a whole, ""The End of All Things to Come"" is the truest representation of the heavy genre to date. I'd place it in the top 3 of my collection of over 6,000 CD's.MuDvAyNe is 4 extremely talented musicians who have definitely delivered yet again."
4,Confused yet Intrigued,"When you listen to this new CD, the first 3 songs are amazing, then after that to me the CD just starts to lose it a bit, its not the same MuDvAyNe that I remember,I dont know the CD sure keeps me listening....Ill have to listen to it a few more times to see what I really think of the CD. As of riggt now though L.D. 50 definetly blows this CD out of the water, that is one of the best CDs that I have heard to date"
4,MuDvAyNe: The End of All Things to Come,"Being a huge fan, I recently got the new MuDvAyNe albume. I went home and immediately popped it in my cd player. This album surprised me. It's not a hard as L.D. 50, and although more political, the album is still great. MuDvAyNe always satisifies and rocks hard."
4,One Great Cd,"This is one of their best CDs. I think they not only rocked on this album, but also learned how to write great songs. If you have Lost and Found you will like this CD."
3,Outter Space or Spaced Out?,"Im not too sure about my feelings on this album so far. I bought it today expecting something great (I thought L.D. 50 was an amazing debut) However, it seems that Mudvayne didnt experiment too much on this album, it seems quite repetetive, and theres not too much happening. I dont know if this album was worth the wait, and frankly i have to say that im dissapointed so far. I have only listened to it one time and perhaps it will grow on me, but as of now i only appreciate about four out of the thirteen songs on the album. Im going to think twice about buying a nu-metal album again without downloading some more mp3s before hand. If you want an album that you WONT be dissapointed with, go with Opeth, they have not yet produced an album i have not greatly appreciated (most people feel the same)."
3,pottery is ..,"Once I forced myself to listen to this CD, I found that they're really not that bad. They're like a more talented, catchy, and just overall better Slipknot. The aggression of Slipknot with the groove of Coal Chamber, and they're talented musicians enough to sell it. I think there are just too many albums out there with this sound to give it any more than three stars. Great background/driving music, though."
4,I Still Enjoy This,"Mudvayne is a band that would always spark my attention. The band may not be ""tr00 m3t4l"", and they may have radio play, but I seriously don't care. This is the last album by them that tends to have a semi-progressive feel to it, and this is what tends to get me into this album so much. ""World So Cold"" is definitely my favorite song, but it's a shame that the media had to butcher it so much for radio play. It's a memorable ballad that will stick in your head. ""Not Falling"" has a definite progressive nature to it, and ""Silenced"" is an energetic song.Overall, I recommend this album to anyone who can keep an open mind and actually care about music. It's not as great as ""L.D. 50"", but it will still ring in your head for years to come, like it has to me."
4,Bringing good songwriting and playing to heavy heavy music,"I didn't think it would be possible to do what Mudvayne's done, but they did it: take good songs and make them almost too heavy. Mudvayne has very good songwriting skills and instrumental chops which come out in most of the songs. The heaviness is almost too much for the songs, though. The distorted death metal scream works best if you're not doing twice in every verse. Think of the Who -- Roger Daltrey's screams were rare but very memorable. The drumming is relentness, and very heavy-metal impressive. The bassist, Mr. Ru-d, even gets funky on the last two songs. If consider the heavier the music, the better the song, you'll give it 5 stars. I have to take a star off, but it's still a very good album."
5,best yet,"This is so much better than ld 50, puts it to shame. The vocals r much stronger and the music sounds so much more tight. This band is one that seems to improve so much from album 2 album. Give it a try you wont feel as you lost any cash on this cd."
4,Pushing Metal Boundaries,"Ok, this just kicks (butt): Mudvayne are back and they can kick anyone's butt. If LD 50 was great, but annoying in some point due to similar songs, this one break this limits by adding melody. Mudvayne just focused on producing cool songs, without losing their freaky attitude about freaky arrangments. So it's all here:the melody, the power, the 17/8 songs - all together in the new metal bible. This is true metal: music that push boundaries, that mix stuffs and influences to create something new to express rebellion. Just great."
2,The epitome of wasted talent,"If you read any of my other reviews you'll see that my tolerance for singers that angrily growl though the songs is short. It is a shock to me how so many Nu Metal rockers accept the mindless shouting that seems to be dominant in the genre these days.On this CD, Not Falling, Mercy Severity and World So Cold are evidence that there is multi-talent in Mudvayne. But the rest of the disk is evidence that there is some weird demand for bands that yell and scream unintelligibly, and Mudvayne succumbs to the pressure of the demand. I don't get it."
5,there baaaaaack,"At first i didnt like the CD i was liek what the hell they turnd soft on me...god this sux bring back the L.D.50 and listen to some ""Dig"" Well after a while i sold it i didnt care for it. Witch was a mistake by the way all of a sudden i wanted to listen to ""Not Falling"" again, so i did what i had to do i bought it again. And this time i was like holy [...] why did i ever sell this cd, it is amazing. I still care for L.D. 50 more than this album but at times i like this one more than L.D. 50 it just depends on my mood. The 1st track is one of my favs and all the way down to the last track, all the songs are good some are ok but overall its a damn well good cd, i recomend this to anyone that likes metal, besure to check out there new album thats comming out very very soon...."
1,mudvayne-end of all things to come,"Sadlly Mudvayne has hit and really missed in my book with this one. I bought this cause the fist single Not Falling was much like Dig witch made me pick up thier first cd. After a couple time playing it on my cd player and hearing the song on the radio the cd was out of heavy rotation with me. The only song that really sticks with me is the Dig Everything and nothing remix on the Resident Evil Soundtrack. I will be previewing any Mudvayne cd that comes out from now on. The one hard song to get you to buy thier cds and the rest just being more calm or boring is not worth my hard earned money. I would expect that this metal band live up to what I picture they should be, with songs like Dig and Not Falling making you shell out that money."
2,sad,"The only reason I gave this album two stars is because some of the songs start off with the right attitude. It doesn't take long, though, for the hard-edged, visceral riffs to give way to empty single note soliloquoys with the lead singer whining about how life sucks. I'll admit that I haven't read the lyrics, but how can I care what someone has to get across in their music if they bore me? They should realize...music first, then message. This band could be awesome if they could manage to maintain the intensity of the first twenty seconds of their songs. I only like a few of the songs on the first album, but I can't even say I enjoyed one on this. I'm not going to put them down anymore. If you didn't absolutely love the first album, then pass this one by; they haven't improved."
3,"if it weren't Mudvayne, I'd give it 1 star.","this cd is vastly different from the LD 50. I suggest not bothering with it if you're not into tripping acid. acid is the only thing that might make this cd better. it's very slow and monotonous, not at all like LD 50. If you liked the whole messeging thru metal thing on LD 50, then you're gonna be dissappointed. the only message here is ""we're dressed like aborted fetuses to draw your attention to our album so that we can go buy Cheese Puffs and Slurpees to munch on until we decide what costumes to wear on the Sanatarium Tour"""
4,Mudvaenima,"Welcome to the more polished version of Mudvayne. Gone from this CD are the things that I absolutely hated about L.D. 50 (the interludes and the cringe-inducing babble at the end of ""Death Blooms""). On The End of All Things to Come, all four band members seem more confident and aware of what they're doing, and they've never sounded better, in terms of both sonic quality and musicianship. No doubt, the ultra-clean David Bottrill is largely responsible for that.That said, I can't help but wonder why the musical antics of Ryan, one of the most exciting bassists in metal today, are so low in the mix. Also, while most of the experiments on this album come together nicely, anthem-rock ballad stylings of ""World So Cold"" are beneath the band. And yet, after triumphant moments like the Tool homage ""Trapped In The Wake Of A Dream"" or the haunting ""(Per)Version Of A Truth,"" all sins are forgiven."
5,Great LD:50 Follow Up,"I have read some reviews on Amazon, and i like that the majority enjoys the new Mudvayne album. Mudvayne has a new sound but along the same lines as there old work. They havn't sold out, they decided themselves to make the album sound the way it did. They will lose some old fans, and gain some new fans. But if you don't like this album, you should of never liked them, because mudvayne is a creative and ordinary music force, and to make an album like ld50 i think would be selling out, instead of using there amazing ability to evolve into something much better.GO BUY THIS ALBUM, IT'S Worth the money, but the dvd is not worth the extra 4 bucks."
5,Great CD.,"First off, I'd like to say Mudvayne kicks ass. The titles that really stick out are: World So Cold, Not Falling. Check out Mudvayne live too, it rocks.Silenced 9Trapped In A Wake Of A Dream 8Not Falling 10Version Of A Truth 8Mercy Serverity 9World So Cold 10+ One of Mudvayne's best songs. Ever.The Patient Metal 8Skrying 7.5Solve Et Coagula 7.2Shadow Of A Man 8The End Of All Things To Come 8Key To Nothing 8Best CD I own. If you like the harder metal, it's a for sure."
5,Great new Album,"The new MuDvAyNe CD is a great new album with alot of great songs, but even though judging how great it is, i feel it falls short of its first album L.D. 50. I also feel that MuDvAyNe changed their music and dosn't really sound like the original MuDvAyNe, and i know im not alone on this one. But i also think that this is a good change and a great way to work in new listeners, get this CD, great music."
5,The End Of All Things To Come,"First off, let me explain why this album is different from L.D. 50. L.D. 50 was capable of putting ideas into your head, The End Of All Things To Come is more likely to put images. It has more of an atmospheric and melodic feel to it. The songs seem to be put together in a more accessable manner, unlike L.D. 50, which took me months of listening to get acquainted with. With all of that said, I think this is a great album. It has a nonstop flow of songs, no interludes. Greg, the guitarist, and Spag, the drummer, really shine on this one. There are so many memorable moments to help make this a perfect album. The guitar riff in the middle of the song (Per)Version Of A Truth, where it's just guitar, is absolutely beautiful. The lyrics are amazing, and they are all printed in the booklet. The artwork in the booklet is really cool as well. Everything about this album is great. Highly recommened if you're interested in seeing what Mudvayne is capable of doing."
3,Decent.,"After LD 50 it must have been pretty hard to top it, and they didn't. That's not to say this is bad. No, it's actually got some songs that were better than some off of LD. Silenced, Not Falling, and World So Cold are all really awesome songs. Too bad that the band had to change their names and their makeup. Now they have queer alien get-ups. I'd say this is better than Beginning of All Things to End, but nowhere near LD 50."
1,Total Garbage,"What happened to these guys? Just a couple of years ago they sounded like the brave new Tool. LD 50 is a brilliant album. However, upon listening to this album, they sound like Slipknot Lite. Its a terrible mess, inflicted by disorganized songwriting and predictable ""hardcore"" riffage and lyrics. This cd is truly garbage and I strongly advise everyone from buying it. The only decent song is ""Not falling"". Download it, burn it, and save your money for LD 50 if you don't already have it."
1,"Wow, incredible...","Yeah, incredible garbage!! Mudvayne is boring hard rock music. You probably love them if you read Hit Parader magazine, though. And listen to a Clear Channel rock station in your pickup truck while you burn a cross on a black person's lawn, you inbred redneck idiot. If you like hard rock, buy some CD's by Mushroomhead. Grow up while you're at it."
4,not bad from a band i didn't excpect much good from,"this isn't a bad cd. amazing, sonsidering the genre they get stuck in.the song ""trapped in the wake of a dream"" is one of the most brilliant songs i have ever heard. compared to the other songs, this is pure genious. doesn't seem to be a fan-favorite, but who cares. it's wonderful.track 8 is also wonderful. kind of a regular rock song, not horribly agressive.the worst tracks, as usual with most albums, are the singles.check it out if you're into...well, just about any kind of rock music."
5,The best water shoes for little feet!!!!,"These are so soft and comfortable and don't allow sand and grit to get in the shoes.The bottoms are a fantastic no-slip rubber material that is not too thick to makethe shoe stiff, but thick enough to walk over a beach with sharp seashells.I would recommend these to everyone."
2,it's not good for kids over 2 years old,"I bought this for my son. After one time use at a Maui beach, it's broken ... I certainly won't recommend this to others."
4,An excellent follow-up to the first Time Scout novel.,"Wagers of Sin is an excellent example of Evens' and Asprin's combined work. The story is strong and the characters have more depth than the first novel. The involvemet of the ""Found Ones"" and Skeeter made what seemingly would be a sappy, happy love story between Margo and Malcolm, into an adventure spanning centuries. I would highly reccommend this novel to any time travel fan."
2,More of the same,"This is one of those sequels that only seems to present more of the same. I'm afraid I trudged though about 1/3 of this book and fell asleep. For me it was one of those books that once you put it down, you can't pick it up again. I may have to come back in 10 years or so and try again."
2,"Wow , the Geo-mod engine is reallyZZzzzzzz....","Better than Unreal? Maybe. As good as a current FPS title? No way. The game is too short, and blowing holes in walls gets real boring after a while. This game looks good however and the parts where you get to pilot tanks and hovercraft is pretty cool but the first game had a better, longer story."
3,Red Faction 2,This shooter game for the PC seemed like it was written more for a console platform. However it was fun. If you like shooters this is okay.
2,Not nearly as much fun as RF (1),...no big deal. I deleted the game half way thru... just got really boring without 'quick save' option. Having to replay loooong segments time after time killed the fun. Graphics seemed a couple steps back from the first Red Faction (what's with that?). I have been enjoying older games for the nostalgic experience... but I'll move on to RF Guerrilla and see if it's a bit more evolved. 'Seems 'quick save' is becoming a rare option in newer games. What's with that?! Cannot recommend this game... even at $12.
2,Disappointing,Not even close to the original Red Faction. It isn't a very long game and doesn't hold interest very well.
1,A Little Disappointing,"The first Red Faction was truly fascinating. I loved the idea of blowing a hole in the floor then going around an obstacle. This was less so. It was far more cartoon-y and less plot-driven. From reading the other reviews, I expected that much, but still wanted to play around in the geomod universe some more, which was the primary reason I bought it. had it not been dirt cheap, I'd have given it a miss."
3,Ups and downs.,"Well, i played it. I enjoyed the graphics. Sound effects were clean. Explosions were loud and messy. The engine used to cut holes any and everywhere was better than in the first. But, i just couldn't get into it. Very different from the first game. For some, that's what they wanted. But, i enjoyed the first game much more. This one was too short. 8 hours to finish it for me. Almost all in one day. I was dissapointed when it was over. Not because i wanted more. But because i knew i'd never play it again. THE BIGGEST SORE SPOT : No instant save system built in. I might have enjoyed this more if they had carried over the quick save that us pc gamers are so lucky to be able to use. It's one of the few tangible things we have over the console systems! Well, other than graphics, and , usually our prices are cheaper for software too. Don't take that away from us too! I WANT MY QUICKSAVE!"
2,Just a mediocre game with some nice graphics.,First off i should say that the original Red Faction is one of my all time fave videogames. It was an absolute masterful game.But IMO volition should have never made a sequel for it. Some games dont need a sequel and Red Faction is one them. Nuff Said.
2,This is a disappointment.,"Found this game in a store today, was exicted, since it's hard to find this game in stores now. So I just grabbed it off the shelf and bought it, without reading the back or anything (which doesn't help), get home, install it, load it up, and notice theres NO multiplayer option, not even LAN, unlike the original Red Faction, it supported Mutliplayer/LAN which made the game, since the single player mode was pretty boring after beating it once. THQ, Violation, you need to come up with a patch/update for this game if you don't want your reputation smashed. This is horrible guys, come on. The engine is too slow, it's like a cheap Quake III: Arena engine in slow motion. Skip this game people, if you don't have Red Faction, get that. If you do have Red Faction, some other games you might like is RTCW (Return to Castle Wolfenstein), Quake III: Arena, or Far Cry."
4,well worth the price,"I have built 2 motors already with this unit. It works great and has not shown signs of excessive wear at all. I have had other ones that wear off the abrasive almost immediately. For the money this is a great option for the small shop/home engine builder. I removed two of the screws to make sure the rings sit flush on the unit as I file them, but that is not a big deal. Make sure you measure often as this cuts fast!"
1,I never got this,"Hey, whoevers out there. I'm reporting that this was never delivered to me. I was definetly charged for it, and never got it. I've sent emails to amazon regarding this and no ones answered me.HELP!!!"
5,Good quality shirt.,"I like this shirt very much. It is made of good quality cotton, not the cheap kind that wears out fast and shrinks."
4,It works.,"This movie is not a great war film, and it is not a great love story. It is oversentimental and ridden with cliches...but it works. It is a very well done movie and I found it to be very moving.The special effects are extremely well done, but this is not a story about air battles (Battle of Britain is a movie about air battles) and it is not a story about pilots (Piece of Cake is a movie about pilots in war).This is a story about about a person who loses everything because of a war.Extremely well acted and a moving story. Don't expect a war movie though, war is the back drop of this story."
4,Good flying film,I bought this DVD for my cousin in Czechoslovakia who flies. The dialogue is in multiple languages and he can watch it in czech.
1,Very poor transaction.,"I'm starting to sound like a cracked gramophone record. We returned five DVD's as they were not compatible for our New Zealand region, as we require the Pal version.We would dearly love to have them all changed over for the Pal version. If that can be arranged, it would be much appreciated."
4,Dark Blue World,If you don't mind subtitles you will enjoy this movie. Way better than Pearl Harbour. The story lines are similar but this one has a better storyline and acting. The cinematography is excellent whenever the Spitfires take to the skies. No cheesy Hollywood ending in this one.
4,Very pleased with this movie!,"My son 12 y/o watched this about 6 times before he forced me into watching it with him. I wasn't keen on a subtitled movie but I know family time is important. My wife and I along with our son gathered on the sofa to sit through it. Now that's an understatement, we sat spellbound. The story, the presentation and to tell the truth it never really occured to me that I was watching a subtitled movie. The scenery is beautiful. The story is both thrilling and romantic. Enjoy."
4,"excellent film, dvd lacking a bit......","I'm sure that you can tell by all of the reviews below that the film is excellent. It is very well done and is one of the best films (not just foreign films) I have ever seen...period! The DVD has some very nice behind-the-scenes features and even the original Czech trailer, but the subtitles have been done rather poorly. Even when English is being spoken on-screen, there are still subtitles.....it is a bit like captions and is very annoying. The English cannot be turned off, because the languages switch back and forth so quickly. That is my main gripe about this edition and the reason why I only gave this dvd 4 stars."
5,a unique ww2 aviation movie,"The plot has been referred to by others, but will add my veiw that this a wonderful ww2 movie, with excellent acting, and spectacular flying sequences for all Spitfire fans. Highly recommended."
3,Interesting but in the end fails to deliver,"Dark Blue World is an interesting and unique story about Czech fighter pilots flying for the RAF during the Second World War. Certainly for the war movie buff who's tired of plrthora of gung-ho American films in this genre, it is a welcome relief. Unfortunately, I didn't find the movie to be all that great. While the combat sequences were great, and the day to day experiences of the Czech pilots insightful, the love triangle the is the central aspect of the movie kind of ruins it. This aspect of the film is just not developed enough to make the movie and moving and powerful as it could have been."
2,Not what is pictured.,"I needed a larger magnifying glass for a project that I am working on. The picture that is shown with the little boy shows a much larger magnifying glass than the one I was sent. The one they sent isn't even 3"". Its very much false advertising and I will not purchase from this individual again!"
4,Not Bad,"I don't know what movie the previous reviewer watched, but it didn't seem like the one I just watched. I thought it was pretty good. Evidently is was a TV mini series in 2008. Don't know how I missed it back when. I would have prefered it wasn't a made for TV flick cause then it would not have to have went through the censors. The language could have been more lively if you know what I mean, a little less TVish."
1,Worst movie ever,"After watching the amazing ""Felon"" with Val Kilmer and Stephen Dorf, I was really looking forward to this movie.But this movie is horrible. It is comprised of very bad acting and all the cliches in the Hollywood scriptwriting book. Horrible."
4,XIii,This movie was better than I expected. Stephen Dorff (even with a bad hair cut) never disappoints. Val Kilmer was good too. Good twist
