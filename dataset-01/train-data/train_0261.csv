2,Starts well but goes flat,"I read this book some time ago and very much enjoyed the first chapter. After that it went a bit flat, though I did manage to finish it. For readers interested in the world Morely explores here, I'd recommend Liza Dalby's ""Geisha,"" or perhaps Ian Buruma's ""Behind the Mask."" Probably best of all is ""Memoirs of a Geisha,"" which is set in the 'water trade' and quite an astonishing book."
2,"Not entirely as expected, but still has some use.","Our first newborn is about to arrive so I bought this based on the previous reviews. The DVD fell a little short and did not cover some key aspects (e.g. diapers). Other aspects (e.g. feeding) are covered better. If I had the chance to do it again, I would not buy it."
4,"Huge, big, strong...HUGE","It's big. It's very, very big. Easy to use, convenient, and BIG. I am considering switching this to my motorcycle and getting a smaller one for my bicycle. Very confident security."
4,solid collection,"Yezzi's collection is a pretty solid collection. It isn't one of those collections that makes your stomach drop, but it is an enjoyable one to read, one that you are sure to find poems to love (without a doubt you'll get a kick out of ""Upon Julia's (...)"" and I also really enjoyed ""Woman Holding a Fox"" and the title poem)."
1,How much art can you take?,"Can't any Doane Stuart grads be content with normal lives, like driving trucks, or selling construction equipment. What's with all the nancy-boy poetry stuff. Jesus."
4,Nice,"A professor of mine recommended this book to me, This book reflects the views of Dr. Victor F. Weisskopf or Dr. Viki he likes to be called. The book is orgrazined in views of science, culture, education and his experience with the two great scientist. I especially, like his experience working with Pauli. Viki does a good job of stating his views about our society and about people/nations. The Privilege of being a physicist is a nice and interesting read and is definitely worth a look."
5,"Love this, pleasantly surprised!","I received this as a shower gift and it is wonderful. Although the size of the organizer looks smallish at first, the pockets are very generous. The metal door hangers do not interfere with closing the door. Very good quality, and I plan to order 2 more of these so I'll have all three colors."
5,Super Book,"This the second time that I have purchased this book, it has a lot of recipes that are fantastic to use. If you are looking to make products from your wax or what have you this is the book for you. It is explained wonderfully. Get this book, make gifts for your friends and family or go into business with your own products at farmers markets."
3,Mediocre,"I was hoping to find several recipes for making different lotions using bees wax and other natural ingredients. I was disappointed. The book only offered one recipe with a few variations. The appendices in the back are very helpful for finding products and the suppliers of them, however, the contacts do not have websites listed."
2,Be wary,Not what it was represented to be. Alot of the stuff is just fluff. The use of honey or beeswax is minascule in the small percentage of the few recipies taht call for them.
2,The good and the bad,"I purchased this item for my father who has a bad back. We were expremely pleased with this item until the second summer we attempted to use it. Two weeks after the warranty expired (1 year warranty) the heater/filter/pump stopped working. The manufacture was not willing to work with us about a discounted replacement etc. The spa, when working, is fantastic. the jets are strong, the heater worked well. The cover was safe (keeping children out). Other than the jets no longer working, the only other issue is the sand, debris that collects at the bottom. I would have serious concerns about buying this product due to the short life of the heater/filter/pump."
4,Not Quite What I Wanted or Expected,"As far as this albumn goes the music is very relaxing and soothing. It is music that can be listened to, to drift off to sleepy bye bye's. The only problem with the albumn is my own expectation of what it would be. I imagined maybe a little more pan pipe style of music, rain and thunder type of atmospheric ambience, rather than the tweetie birds and animal sounds.Music is a very subjective thing, so if you want true rainforest type of music this albumn is for you. Any other preconcieved idea, and it may not be what you are looking for."
1,THIS IS THE WRONG PICTURE!,"This item has the wrong picture. The picture is of rerailer with terminal. I ordered the curved track to complete a figure 8 with a 30 degree crossing. The problem is that the item number #44501 is just a 4 pack of 18"" diameter curved track. The items description is correct, but I think most of us rely on the picture to be accurate."
4,Excellent valued speakers ...,"I just started using these and I will admit they aren't the higest power rated speakers but for a directional 7.1 gaming rig and personal surround system the price is impossible to beat... I bought this with an Audigy 2 Gamer and the best game out there (FarCry) and the price is excellent... The bundle of games with the Audigy 2 Gamer is also a great deal for those that don't have them(...)P>Use the gift certificate for Unreal 2004, Doom 3 or Half Life 2...Keep in mind to get maximum value out of this you need to add a solid video card to your rig. Picked up a Geforce 6800GT OC and am sitting pretty...Happy gaming..."
5,Two awesome flicks,Usually when ever I see a 2 movie set on 1 DVD or Blu Ray I only like 1 movie or I already own the one I want.These 2 are both violent flicks yet are not for voilence sake. But to tell 2 good stories.I've always wanted both especially on Blu Ray and now both were $7.49.5 stars for the deal alone. I purchased another 2 movie set at the same time. This one better. Both 5 star movies In my opinion.So In every aspect this Is a 5 star deal. Hope this helps.
4,Good for expanding an existing set,"Good quality product if you're looking to quickly expand an existing loop of the EZ track. By itself, it will not create a complete loop of track. If you're expanding a simple-kid friendly layout, this is a good choice, the sections can easily be attached and detached and the plastic base allows you to operate a train on almost any surface, including soft carpeting. The gray roadbed (standard with the Nickel Silver track) is a passable stand-in for ballast (esp. for children), but you'll need to work hard to add detail if you're incorporating it into a realistic diorama or layout. Switches for EZ track are fussy and will require tweaking depending on your rolling stock. Some of my rolling stock pass the switches just fine, others derail. This problem has been noted on numerous EZ track reviews here and elsewhere and remains a problem with the switches in this set."
2,Very disappointing; box diagrams misleading,"This is a minimal add-on kit that assumes the purchaser already has an 18"" radius track on which to add. The diagrams on the box are misleading if one assumes that one can build any of the track layouts without any previous 18"" radius track layout. Generally, I really like Bachmann products. The nickel-silver E-Z track concept is unequalled. The ad should clearly indicate that this is an add-on if the prospective buyer already has a compatible 18"" radius set up. I understand what ""expander"" implies. It is not readily apparent, however, that one needs to have already purchased a few hundred dollars in 18* radius track."
3,Rosalba Neri stars in an otherwise ho-hum Spaghetti Western,"If it werent for the incomparable Rosalba Neri, this movie would be a total stinker (one star). She's great as always in this movie, playing a villainess (note: she stays fully clothed in this one you pervs, go watch Amuck! or Lady Frankenstein if this is a problem for you). She alone is the reason I give this movie three stars. I'm not a fan at all of Mark Damon as the lead in a western, but whatever, this may or may not be a problem for most. I'm just saying this would've been a way better movie with Lee Van Cleef or someone in the lead male role. The theme song is either annoying or hilarious depending on your personality.This DVD package is nothing special. No real special features, fullscreen presentation. I actually recomend the version that is included in the ultra-common 20 movie Spaghetti Western pack from Mill Creek Entertainment because at least the version included in this package is widescreen."
3,Could have been more.,"I purchased this disc hoping it was a cd version of the 1950's era MGM vinyl LP E-3222 of ""A Christmas Carol"" featuring Lionel Barrymore as Scrooge. That vinyl LP can also be found for sale on Amazon. Side 1 is ""A Christmas Carol"", and side 2 is Christmas carols performed by the Canterbury Choir. This CD is indeed that same recording. This disc, however, only contains half of the carols as the original LP. Total time on this disc is only 35:41. The original LP was only about 46 minutes, and they could have easily fit all of that material on here. I'm guessing this was probably a bargain basement Christmas CD that Polygram issued in 1994. Although it's great to have a clean version of the original LP, I am disappointed that it is not the complete original LP."
5,Excellent for dance work or trance and ritual work....,This is an intense CD filled with focused percussion and rhythm work; I find it very useful when I'm writing or dancing; it allows me to flow into a state of mind and run with it. Excellent work and I'll definitely check out their other CD's.
2,"Rather monotonous, unless you like percussion...","Frankly, I found this album to be very disappointing. While I'm sure a number of people are fond of percussion, I feel the composer and artists take the concept of ""beat"" to unacceptable extremes. The constant and overbearing drumming, pounding and thumping drown any melody which, from time to time, pops up in the amazingly clone-like selections. And it progresses from the merely annoying (to my ear) to the oppressive. My personal thought is that any connection between the music on this album and anything that might be considered anciently or eternally Egyptian is in the imagination of the creators: a more apt title might be ""King Tut's Tomtoms."" Sorry to be so negative about this album, but I found the music boring and monotonously predictable and, after nearly 51 minutes, was immensely relieved to hear its last dying throb diminish into blessed silence."
3,oarlocks,definately not as good as the heavy duty ones. i should have spent a couple more dollars and bought a second set of heavy duty oarlocks.
4,great simple toning for everyone,"This video is pretty good, it has a very small portion of aerobics as a warm up and then light toning exercises mixed with streching. Anyone can do this video, the people in the video are regular people of all ages. The only draw back is this may not be enough of a workout for people who already exercise regularly. Otherwise, it is a great tape that I highly recommend! The exercises in the tape are very similar to the Origional Buns of Steel, but a lot slower and easier!"
1,Easy for beginners -- this video is not!,"I would NOT recommend this video for beginners. I am over 40 and wanted exercises to just tone my body. A video that I wouldn't mind exercising with every day and not dread it. These exercises are very hard to me. It was nothing like I expected for beginners as the subject stated, ""Easy Toning"". These exercises are ones that I did maybe 20 years ago and were too hard for me then."
3,"Good, but not great.","I have found many other CDs that have a better collection of Rock Christmas songs than this one.There are two songs on this CD that I wanted in my holiday collection: ""Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You"" and ""I Believe in Father Christmas.""When I listened to it, the version of ""I Believe in Father Christmas"" is not the ORIGINAL by Emerson Lake and Palmer I was accustomed to hearing on the oldies stations during the holiday season. It is also not the same version that I have on a CD single that seems to be very difficult to find from the mid-1990s. Did they remake it when this CD was released?Be prepared when listening to this CD, this version is not what you used to hear back in the ""old days."""
3,I have a question!,I want to buy this CD for my mom for her birthday (which is right around christmas). She loved The Moody Blues version of What Child is this? but when I look at the track lists someone else has done that song. can someone explain to me what happened to it?
4,Make sure you get the CD for the bonus tracks!,This is one of those CDs that seems a little weak at first but it does grow on you after a while. It's more than worth the cost of admission to get the Billy Squier track - my favorite Rock 'n' Roll Christmas tune! Merry Christmas!
3,"Adequate, but nothing more","Although the CD includes tracks by stars such as Elton John, Jon Bon Jovi, and Bob Seger, it's definitely lacking in depth. Many of the songs were unknown to me; they should have chosen more popular Christmas songs. The Moody Blues' ""What Child Is This"" and the George Thorogood song were the best. Try ""A Rosie Christmas"" instead."
3,Rock n ROll - old school,"The CD is Christmas from Rock n Roll oldies. It's OK, but I wouldn't have bought it if I listened to it first."
3,Rocking Christmas,"A Rock 'n' Roll Christmas is a decent collection with some classic numbers like Elton John's rollicking ""Step Into Christmas"", Bob Seger's channeling both James Brown & Mitch Ryder on ""Sock It To Me Santa"", The Kinks getting punkish on ""Father Christmas and The Waitresses always welcome ""Christmas Wrapping"". The set is downgraded a star by Jon Bon Jovi's wretched ""I Wish Everyday Could Be Like Christmas""."
4,ROCKIN' AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE,"A ROCK 'N' ROLL CHRISTMAS-VARIOUS ARTISTS: Here's one of the smartest, rockin'-rollin'-est holiday purchases amid the bazillion xmas albums out there. If you prefer something a little stronger than Nat King Cole and Dean Martin in your stocking, George Thorogood cranks it up on the hoof stompin' title track as only a Delaware blooze basher can. Upping the fun ante another notch is Bob Segar doin' a sweat-soaked James Brown impression on his pre-superstar snatch of cool yule SOCK IT TO ME SANTA, while the always delightful Kinks contribute cynical masterstroke FATHER CHRISTMAS. Other cult classics include Elton John's joyous STEPPIN' INTO CHRISTMAS, the Waitresses' ear-worm contender CHRISTMAS WRAPPING, and Emerson, Lake and Palmer's serene I BELIEVE IN FATHER CHRISTMAS. Semi-annoying Jon Bon Jovi and Billy Squier efforts aside, A ROCK 'N' ROLL CHRISTMAS bashes it out in a way that the Little Drummer Boy never dreamed of.RATING: THREE FROSTY ONES"
4,Great for crossing language barriers with children,"My church used this book on a short term mission trip to Rancho de Sus Niños in Mexico. Most (all but one) of the group spoke only English while most of the children speak only Spanish or a few words in English. We used this book to put on a puppet show. The English part allowed our church members to understand the book so as to make the puppet show match the words. The Spanish speaker in the group read the book aloud to the children and the rest of the team acted it out with a few cute twists. The show went over well both times it was performed. Having a simple, bilingual story to follow helped greatly. The kids appreciated it and so did the English speaking mission team."
3,Could be better,"Lots of little tiny pieces! My son received it for Christmas, and was very excited to build it, he is 6, it took us over 1 hour and he had difficulty manipulating the tiny pieces and the screwdriver key that helps attach the pieces. The characters are very colorful and overall the toy holds his attention and offers an opportunity for imaginative play. I don't like all the small guns, handcuffs, and this set really reminds me of an old fashioned gallows. Beware the cannon really shoots toy rocks (hard plastic balls) very far..like 20 feet or so and there is no controlling how far the blast goes."
1,bad action and storyline,"this follows the same quality of KND which means these kind of drawings weren't made for action sequences. Plus the storyline is completley stupid. The voice actiong is horrible and the action is stipid. Come on Butch, if yoou want to make an action cartoon, at least use comic book drawings that look real instead of unreal cartoons. If you want an action cartton, go buy a japenese cartoon or a movie, not these"
4,Very Clever,"My children loved this movie, as did my husband and I. My husband and I might have enjoyed it even a bit more because we understood all the parodies. ""Chucky Black and the Great Menorrah"" was a hoot. If you love the ""Fairly Odd Parents"", you'll love this movie!"
5,I'm a die hard Fairly oddparents fan,I love the fairly odd parents and I can only say I haven't found an episode I didn't like.
5,This Movie rocks,This movie is relly cool. It is really cool beacause Timmy Turner runs away into televison. Timmy has to stop vicky before she gets to the biographical channel with is chanel 298 and takes over the world with his fairy god parents and a verson of himself.
4,Nice piano music,"If you are a fan of Danny Wright, here's another to add to your collection. Very nice music. Signature sound."
3,A Review for Bradford's Crossword Dictionary,"The size of the dictionary is good for convenience. I wish that the book had words categorized by number of letters in the words. Would help in solving puzzles. the book was okay, but I am still looking for that one which will answer all the clues!!"
4,The Duke's Descent Review,"We have done many of these games, our favorite being The Last Train From Paris. It had some boring characters, and it was easy to guess the murderer. Unlike some of the others, it had a predictable plot, and the conceal's were not that interesting compared to others. If you're looking for a party game, How to Host a Murder is REALLY fun. We just wouldn't highly recomend this one.P.S.-the meal suggestion was wild boar. Don't even ask. Ceaser salad is much better."
4,train,It is great seeing my son laughing while the train goes round and round and at pretty good speed. He likes to change the speed and direction. He has fun playing with it.
4,An OK Read,Another one by Short that is a bit deep and hard to follow but I'd still recommend it for the bits of wisdom that can still be found in it.
5,Churro galore,"After a few conversions to the recipe, loaded up the churrara and was frying up some churros in thirty seconds or less. Couldn't find any caster sugar locally, but settled for the finely grained baking sugar my father brought home for me. Using a big cast iron deep walled pan to cook these in and it works out nicely with a baking pan laid with paper towel and grate to drip dry the oil off as soon as they're pulled from the pan. Still need to get a salt shaker or something to evenly apply the sugar afterwards. Only used it once so far. Easy to clean and reassemble. Time will tell if the structure is sturdy. I like me some churros."
5,Vetwrap,I ordered it because my dog had a leg wound in an unsual place which was making bandaging very difficult. This self-adhering bandage material is wonderful and this was a good price.
5,always hopeful,The originally essay sounds much too hopeful for the present time--early 21st century. But yet it has a lot of good ideas that could help bring hope back. It could become a classic in the field.
1,BAIT AND SWITCH,"I received a GTMax Bluetooth Dongle USB Adapter for Verizon Motorola Droid A855 CDMA Cell Phone and not the one made by EDR. In contrast to ""EDR"" products, the product and the packaging lack any manufacturer address or contact info. There is no warranty information anywhere in the package. Worst of all, no software was provided with the product. I intended to use the device for stereo audio mostly. The default Windows XP bluetooth driver provides no functionality besides just recognizing the presence of the device. ""GT Max"" has no website that could be used to download the required software to make the device operate. In short, the experience was not a good one. The plus in the whole affair is that the vendor, BargainCell did ship immediately and I received the product quickly. It is beyond monetary reason to return this product to the vendor for a refund due to the cost of the required 'trackable' shipping that must be paid by the customer."
1,Don't buy,"I bought this Bluetooth adapter a long time ago. Back in 08' I believe. Was the worst thing ever, should have known when buying such a cheap product. Had to use some proprietary software that you had to freaking pay for to even do anything with it. I believe I just tossed the thing since it wasn't worth all the time and hassle. There was ways to ""hack"" your Windows OS to think that it was another product but that required you to go download shady things etc etc. Not worth the time. Spend your money on a quality Bluetooth dongle."
1,Stereo headsets won't work with this,The bluesoleil software that comes with the dongle is an unlicensed version and requires you to pay an additional 20 Ero to get it to work with a stereo headset.
2,What about the drivers?,"My complaint is that when you install the bluesoleil software that comes with the disk, it is an unlicensed version and requires you to pay an additional 20 Ero to get it to work with a stero headset on Vista. Very disappointing. If your going to sell a product and have it come with software, the software should be fully licensed!"
3,"Good, but","This product works fine, but it will only allow 5 - 10 transfers before it loses connection. All you have to do is to remove it then plug it back in and it will establish a connection again. Nothing to it but just a small inconvience."
1,Junk!!!,"When I purchased this, the product description said that the dongle would come with installation software. The only thing that was in the package was the dongle. A good dongle would work with Windows software but this one does not. It does not work. . .period. There was a piece of black tape covering the Bluetooth markings on the dongle. I assume this was meant to hide the fact that the dongle isn't the 2.0 EDR version that was advertised. Please do not buy from this vendor. You will be extremely dissatisfied."
1,Didn't work!,"Installing the software was easy, but the dongle didn't work. It said something like it reported errors or a malfunction and shut down. Sounds like it's defective, but it's not worth it to send back. I might tinker with it more later to see if the problem is crap software."
1,Not for Skype users,"I bought this to use it with skype, to get rid of all the cables, the skype phones etc. Unfortunatelly, the link between this bluetooth and the line was awfull. Interaptions, no connections, connection failures. Even with the latest drivers, the result was a complete loss of time.If you want to use skype, i suggest you to turn to other solutions, or another bluetooth. Not this one."
2,"I was hopeful.... but overall, this one was a disappointment...","I really wanted to like this book... the setting was amazing, the mystery behind the characters was a bit intriguing, but.... alas, the overall story was actually a bit dull. The author tried so hard to create suspense in this story that it ended up crawling at a snail's pace. The ""paranormal"" elements of the story were not really all that interesting and were slim compared to the dragging suspense. And as far as the romance between the leading lady and her dashing hero, I would say it was lukewarm at best. And I can't stress enough how annoying it is to have everything explained and clarified in what seems to be a hurried rapid fire mess of a last chapter. I would say this book had some potential, but just wasn't executed to the full extent that it could have been."
3,zen clear case,"the case works great,just wish it would have had the strap to hold it on your persons, delivery was great.the soft back stop are great for pretecting my zen."
5,awesome product,"This product is wonderful! It is helpful with sleeping, general relaxation, anxiety. The products were received in excellent condition, brand new, factory sealed. Will order this again from the same vendor."
4,Decent libido booster,"I take it at bedtime once in a while and it seems to work pretty good. It's one of those products like Fenugreek, Tribulus, etc. It does a decent job but for a powerful product see my review of DAA."
3,Not impressed.,I started taking these supplements as a pain relief. I could not tell that they helped me at all.
1,It was not good!! Not true at all.,"I think, this book is good for recycling. less then 1% wastrue, almost nothing was true. Bunch of garbage ;-( It's not true at all. Don't buy this author's bppl. Very depressing, untrue, nothing positive. Bunchof lies. DON'T BUY!!"
1,THE TRUTH ON CHINESE SUPERSTITION,"WELL, I WAS VERY EXCITED TO READ THIS BOOK UNTIL I ACTUALLY READ IT. DEPENDING ON YOUR CHINESE ANIMAL SIGN, I FOUND 99% OF THE MATERIAL VERY DEPRESSING AND NEGATIVE.THERE WAS VERY LITTLE IN MY SIGN THAT THE AUTHOR WAS POSITIVE ABOUT. ACCORDING TO HIM I, AND OTHER SIGNS SUCH AS THE TIGER BASICALLY SHOULD BEWARE OF 2002. THIS TYPE OF READING WILL MAKE MOST SIGNS OF PEOPLE BEWARE OF THE YEAR 2002 AS IF THE YEAR 2001 HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH FOR MOST AMERICANS. TYPING TO CROSS CULTURE THE ASTROLOGY REALMS ONE HAS TO WONDER THE VALIDITY OF SUCH WRITINGS."
2,NONSENSE?,THIS BOOK WAS FIRST PUBLISHED IN THE 1800'S BUT SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE FAR FUTURE. I VERY MUCH ADVISED MANY ADEPTS FROM ALL PATHS TO HAVE THIS BOOK IN THEIR COLLECTION. GOOD FOR REFERENCE. ABSTRACT CONCEPTS AND WILL VIEW THE WORLD IN A DIFFERENT WAY. THE AUTHOR SEEMS TO TALK A LOT OF NONSENSE.
2,Tristes Tropiques,Mildly interesting (now 1/3 through it).Very detailed with long run-on sentences.Hopefully it will get better.
4,Great,"Well, it is a text book, what can I say about it...it is a good one. It explains everything clearly and makes it easy to understand. I liked working on the ""Crack the Case"" as they lead you trough the last chapter and ensures, that you can apply, what you just read about. At least theoretically.Working with this book was easy."
4,Worth the money.,I ordered this canvas organizer online after unsuccessfully trying to find it in the local stores and it is really nice. I was unable to find ANY other canvas organizers of the same design and I am considering ordering a second one. It's cute and it seems well made. I didn't pay close attention to its dimensions in the product description so I had expected it to be a bit wider but I'd still recommend this product. Our baby's room is pretty small and this product allows us to utilize valuable limited space and I can think of plenty of fun uses for it.
4,"Nice, but hangs too high on door.","The organizer is a nice idea and is constructed well. However, it hangs very high on the door - a few inches from the top. I am tall enough to reach it (5 foot 7 inches), but a person who was any shorter would have a difficult time reaching the top two pockets."
5,Great Organizer,I got this organizer for my son and daughters room and it is a great value for the money. I had bought an exact one for my son's room from Pottery Barn kids and it was $29 and its essentially the same exact thing without the animals embroidered on the top. The sage green is such a pretty color. I love the pink color too for girls but since my kids are sharing a room I chose to go with the neutral sage color.
2,Doesnt fit a door that has a wide width,"I bought this to have my baby girl's things more organized and I tried to put it in the back of the door- didnt fit. I see the picture now and instead of back of the door- I am going to see if I put it in a rod!Post review-4/21/2006I stuck 2 nails on it and forget the hooks it comes with- I hung it right on the nail and it fit- I stuffed the pockets and by sticking the 2 nails - it worked for me - so I might just go and buy another one because it sure did lessen some of that cluster I felt I had- put her socks, bibs hair accessories, Her cd's and tapes... I might just put another one for her lotions, onesies, and other things I have an abundance of....Thank YOU!!!!!! Now I give it (with the hooking it up on nails) 4 stars ****"
5,Great space saver!!,"With limited room in my daughter's nursery, we hung this over the closet door right next to the changing table. I store diapers and wipes, and roll her blankets to tuck into one pocket too. On the top we have a few stuffed animals peeking out. A perfect accessory!"
2,Toenail Fungus,"I have been using this product-twice a day for 3 months. I have not seen any improvement in my nails- no worse but no better. This product never dryed my skin as was stated on product description, which was good. I think this product might work for some but has no real benefit for others."
5,A must-have for collectors of Southern cookbooks,"This book is the classic tome of Southern cooking. If you are interested in learning ""old-fangled"" Southern recipes, it all begins here with Mrs. Dull's very famous volume. If you collect cookbooks and have an interest in Southern food, this belongs in your collection, whether for study or for cooking."
1,Don't Bother With This Book,"I too am very unhappy and disappointed with this book and agree that the cooking instructions are too vague. To the reviewer who felt the need to comment on the ""ignorance in another review"" you need a reminder that everyone is entitled to their opinion on the book and that this is not a forum for attacking other reviews."
3,"Odd, very odd.","Duff Brenna's The Altar of The Body is an odd, not too likable, but hard to forget book.Brenna's ability to define character in a few lines is a strength of this book. He is an excellent writer.Buck, Joy, and Livia are a brass band against the sonata of George's life.Three is violence, and sadness, and the very real decline of Livia into ""senility,"" Livia's senility resembles Multi-infarct Dementia, and George and Joy's struggle to provide the best care for Livia is the best, strongest aspect of this book.This is not a book for the faint hearted."
4,For the Ageless Avid Beachcomber,"If you like to collect seashells, then this handy key to the typical shells found on a beach may be of interest. It comes in a handy soft cover and is pocket sized, so it will easily fit in one's bathing suit's waist. It is slender, although several of the easy to find shells are listed, photos are reasonable and of good quality. It is similar to other such books, although not quite a book and not quite a pamphlet. It's in a league of its own!"
5,It is the best book for amateur,"This is my first seashell book about north america, I have to say author written this with his heart. Really thoughtful for amateurs,from the way that how to identify the seashell, he gave many good suggestions.The pictures are all drawings by hand,I like the way he illustrate all the features.A good book for beginners, a good book for your child."
4,A Great Starter Book...,"I got this book along with the Golden Guide on Birds of North America (to replace my parents well-worn 1966 edition that literally fell apart from use.) I was looking for a book to help me identify my many seashells collected in Hawaii, Florida, & the Northeast. The book is great for teaching the beginner about shell structure & formation, as well as how to start cataloging your shells, & where to look for new ones. It's a great overall book but I find now with the many various guides I purchase, I am finding it easier to deal with books that contain photographs instead of drawings so I take off one star for that but this is a great little comprehensive guide for the beginner shell enthusiast."
3,"Useful, but a little out of date","I recently went to Addis Ababa for a quick trip and purchased this guide to see where to go and where to eat. I found that while the descriptions of tourist places were great and the information on Ethiopian culture was useful, the details about hotels and restaurants were less so. Many of the places I tried to visit from the restaurants section were closed or the taxi drivers did not know them. I was a bit less enthused about the National Museum as the author was and found that the museums attached to the churches were more interesting and better presented. The prices published in the are out of date as well, so expect to pay more. Also, having purchased the kindle version the maps were not very useful either as they were split onto different pages. I probably would purchase the paperback copy next time."
3,kindle edition review,"This is a format review for the kindle version.I am disappointed in the packaging of the bookno index, a hard to use table of contents.The pictures of the print edition is missing.The maps are present but not very useful since they do not scale.I love the info inside, but the format leaves a lot to be desired, and so does the price.I recommend the print version, though I love the fact that I can take it with me on my kindle with no extra weight!5 stars for content, 2 stars for format gives this 3 stars for me"
3,the quality of the print,"I just bought Ethiopia travel guide.As the book is not available in Israel I couldn't look over it before, but as it was highly recommended I ordered it.I have nothing to say as regarding the information but I am very much disappointed from the print quality.The format is very small and the color is grey, so it is impossible reading it without using magnifying glass and extra light.Altho I understand the necessity to produce light book to carry you have to consider the hardships using it on the way - it is quite impossible!!!"
3,Reminds me...,"This kinda reminds me of depeche mode. If you like the heavy syntheziser and the electronic (male) vocals, I would say buy it. This is my first intro to Steve Lawler and I'm not overly impressed. Maybe the set warms up as it goes along. The only advantage is it's good driving music cause the synth/bass keeps the tempo the whole way through."
2,The Dark Drums are Dead,"I was hoping Lights Out 3 was an anomaly, but I was mistaken. This is firmly the new Lawler, and the Dark Drums are dead.For those who like ambient, trippy, electronica, this is your CD. Anyone looking for music reminiscent of dark tribal house, please do not buy this album. CD3 is experimental at best, its relation to the entire compilation incongruous. Between 1 and 2, I count 2-3 tracks worth mentioning.What always made Lawler so special is he brought the FUN. This album is heady, serious, and engineered. These CDs have music that would clear a dance floor and have everyone turn to each other wondering what the DJ is doing."
1,RIP Harlem Records,"First two cd's are alright, electro house sounding, the third cd is u absolute sh--. WTF was Lawler thinking. If anyone tries top defend this 3rd cd, you're a moron"
4,I am a lexical omnivore,"Yes, this book will interest all lexical omnivores, those collectors and aficionados of uncommon words, words which can be used to signify social superiority. It is in this book that I encountered and peremptorily metabolised some of my most choice lexical items -canard"", ""egregious"", ""screed"", ""sciolist"" ""asinine"" etc which I now employ with casual ubiquity. This book will augment your vocabulary and distend your self-image."
4,The Superior Person's Book of Words,I just found this book at Restoration Hardware and it looks delightful. It will be a Christmas gift for a very superior person! 12/99
3,Jumps around a lot,"Like most of the Special Forces memoirs of the Vietnam experience, this one also has an often interesting, fun, and exciting story to tell. I did enjoy this book. However, my disappointment with this book stems from the writing style. I would compare the flow of this book to a music video. The author jumps around a lot while telling his stories. He mixes fragments of scenes and stories together concurrently, introducing something, but then moving on to something else only to return later. At times the reading is very disjointed, therefore, hard to follow. It is a good book that could have flowed better."
4,must need,"these are vital for the rumble robots. some people think its just a waste of time and money and its easier to just press a button on the controler, but these really help you win your match. the upgrade cards are great and the gold cards are perfect for a tough match. so they may be a waste but if your a true rumble robots fan you'll wat to buy these cards."
4,sWEET sTUFFS,"SO cool attacks, my pack included these speical edition attacks:mega Punch, Swift Spore, clobber kick, knuckle crunch, steel fist, iron lungs, glass shatter, leg loser, mouth strecther, pit pull, and Skull Bash. There is ven one extra super card the same one is in every pack, though it is the best move ever! It is called "" SKULL BASHER DELUXE""! I have one every fight with this attack!"
3,A fun and interesting collection.,"I had not ever had the chance to read any of Bill Pronzini's novels...but I am certainly going to sample a few following this is a fine collection of short stories.Of those included, I most enjoyed: The Monster, Thirst and Wishful Thinking.There's a little something to be had here for everyone. All the tales had a wonderfully unique writing style. Some were very pulp-esque, while others displayed some great straightforward narration!The rating should actually be 3 and 1/2 stars. I would have gone higher, but some of the shorts simply weren't my cup o' tea. But that doesn't mean someone else won't like them!Not bad at all. A fun and interesting collection."
5,Excellent,I highly recommend this collection. The footage is priceless and the quality is excellent. I gave it to my stepdad who is a WW11 veteran from the Pacific conflict. He loves it!
3,"Nice item, just wish everything I get from Amazon didn't arrive beat up!","This is a really nice set for WW II buffs. It has a lot of great footage. The only drawback is that when it arrived it looked as though the box it came in had been through the war. I am getting so tired of ordering things from Amazon (specifically books, and DVD sets) only to have them arrive with torn or ripped corners. If I had ordered this set for a gift, I would have sent it back for replacement. The edges of the box looked like it had been dropped, and the top of the box was torn. Oh well."
2,potential gone flat,"I got this flick because I had a coupon for Redbox. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it anywhere.The movie started off interesting enough...for about the first ten minutes, then pffft.I ended up fast forwarding through a lot of the film, then finally getting to the end only to be left seriously hanging. No explanations. Nada. It could have been worth my while had the killer been explained because what they did finally show of him at the end could have made him a very intriguing character.I'm usually not a harsh critic, but I wish I'd read the reviews before renting this."
1,stinker.,this movie was so bad....dont want to waste time explaining it...good concept?!?! but ultimately really really awful.thank god it was free.
1,Dont waste your hard earned dollar on this movie,"Not worth the money! Spent 1 hour shouting at my TV saying ""omg just run"" or 2 guy's on one ""BEAT HIM UP"" the movie was not planned out right. Amazon should have a refund button! One review said it was like the film ""Phone booth"" this film did not have a good plot as phone booth. Save your MONEY!"
1,Pointless and Disappointing,"WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD - Here is the movie in a nutshell; three employees leave a Christmas party at the office and stop off at an ATM. While they're getting money out of the machine, a stranger shows up and traps them inside the ATM booth. Everyone dies inside the ATM except one guy who is framed for the murder of his friends and the real bad guy slips away into the night.And who is the bad guy? Good question; he is some random guy who lives in a storage shed and has detailed maps of all the ATMs in the area. We never see his face, we never know why he did it... there is absolutely no reasons or clue given as to why all this happened in the movie, so your left to draw your own conclusions about a movie that was actually rather pointless and disappointing.Do yourself a favor, when you go the the ATM to take out money; don't use that hard earned cash to buy or rent this movie... it is not worth a nickle."
2,huh?,the film was entertaining and would have been happy with watching it if it was a free cable movie. the movie is NOT worth the price! Its all circumstantial! Poor ending. Just an ATM serial killer that remains unknown the ENTIRE movie.
3,Good Thriller but HORRIBLE ENDING!,"Great thriller with decent acting and a unique concept, but has a terrible ending! I will not get into it, to not give it away, but the ending could have been much better!"
3,Cheesy but entertaining if you know what you're getting into,"Pretty good film for being low budget. Acting was surprisingly good. However, the plot and the character development of the villain/antagonist was lacking. I was hoping for a deeper reveal at the end but instead was left a little dumbfounded."
4,great thrill ride !!!!,great horror movie.....it was worth the 9.99 i spent on it when it came out........very entertaining.....good amount of blood scenes.........kind of a twisty ending....i liked it !!!
1,Pointless and Quite Bad,"This movie was a complete waste of time. It had no point and was poorly written, acted, directed, and produced. Please pass. The only reason for this review is to try to save others the mistake I made. If you have to see it, you'd be better served by watching the trailer 30 times. The trailer had every good part and saves you the trouble of even trying to care enough. A complete disappointment. You'd be better served with a classic such as Seven."
2,Don't pay much to watch this please..,"I know short reviews usually get unhelpful votes, but there's not much I can say without ruining the movie.Three people end up trapped in an ATM room because of a psycho in a hooded coat. He more or less wants toplay a game with them, than outright murder the trio. I can't recommend watching this movie unless you onlypay a dollar for it at the redbox. Please don't pay more than that to watch this movie."
2,ATM,"Just finished watching it, and don't have much to say other than it was very disappointing, and I should have listened to all the ones who rated it low on the IMDB board. Too many stupid things occurred to keep count, and I don't even have enough interest to recall the events to explain. None of the characters were developed very well, and they all fell flat, and felt superficial. If you want to see a suspenseful thriller where people are trapped try ""Frozen"" or the european version ""Inside""."
5,I only withdrawal during day light.,I did not have high hopes for this one but it did surprise me. It was a great ride. I hope this becomes a franchise.
3,Good up until the last 5 Minutes,"So It was a good little flick, wasn't expecting some super amazing film anyway, but it was good. HOWEVER the ending is the most horrible ending I've ever seen in a thriller.Expect to be dissapointed with the ending big time!!!"
2,As Expected,"So deeply flawed. Only rented for Alice Eve., If you can watch it for free and absolutely like commenting on stupid movies with all who are watching then by all means. Otherwise stay far away."
3,ATM A SOMEWHAT BLANK CHECK,"I watched two movies last night (The other one was THE FIELDS) and both movies showed promise but both ended without satisfying resolutions.ATM sets up a simple but intriguing premise: three young business people stop at an ATM, only to be terrorized by a psychotic killer. Suspense ensues with some incredibly stupid plot devices. First and foremost, why does David park so far away from the ATM kiosk? As does the security guard. Why does Corey lie about having a lighter? Other questions would serve as spoilers so I won't go there.Brian Geragthy, Josh Peck and Alice Eve are fine in their roles and director Chris Fisher uses the claustrophobic setting effectively. Too bad his script didn't measure up.ATM could've been a tidy little thriller but ultimately is a misfire."
3,It was a good movie but confusing at times...,I loved the movie it was good but the ending was a bit confusing for me at least the video quality was excellent though
2,Not worth watching,"The movie was pretty good in terms of suspense, but as another reviewer mentioned it's a little too much like a sequel to Friday the 13th that takes place in an ATM. And again, as others have already mentioned, the ending is horrible because it makes absolutely no sense. Nothing is explained - Literally! - so by the time the movie ends you find yourself wishing you hadn't bothered watching it to begin with."
3,Always carry Cash,"Just finished watching ATM and thought it was well acted ,well thought out and somewhat clever but there were also some pretty big plot holes,I won't go into them because I don't want to venture into spoiler territory.The camera work and film quality were excellent and lent to the rich feel of the production.If your expecting a blood bath or a gore fest this isn't the film for you, there are some violent scenes but nothing really graphic.So gore hounds skip it.It is instead a taunt thriller with some very tense moments with a claustrophobic feel .Think Frozen meets P2 but in a confined area.The only problem I had with this film was that there was no back story or explanation given about the menacing figure outside the ATM.I wanted to know what his motive was because in the film it clearly seems personal.Bottom line,I recommend it if your looking for a good executed thriller,taking in consideration the con that I mentioned."
2,HE IS OUT THERE SOMEWHERE,"David (Brian Geraghty) is a shy stock investor. Co-worker Emily (Alice Eve) is perhaps equally shy. On her last day of work, David works up the courage to ask her out. She agrees and also agrees to let David drive her home. The problem is there is a third wheel, mutual co-worker Corey (Josh Peck) who needs a ride and is hungry. They agree to grab a bite at a unique all night place that only accepts cash. They must first visit a remote ATM. Time and temperature are flashed for us to set the tone: 1:18 AM, -3F. The three are in the ATM.Outside the ATM, is a man assuming the ""Jason pose."" He brutally murders another man in the parking lot. The trio is afraid to venture out and I am thinking...did they just remake an ATM version of ""Frozen""?For some undisclosed reason the killer doesn't try to enter the ATM. You will find out more, or less at the ending.If you liked ""Frozen"" or ""Altitude"" (and I didn't) you might try ATM.1 f-bomb, no sex or nudity."
4,Great movie!!,"Glad we rented this movie, it was good - ending wasn't what I excepted but it was a good Twist. I won't ruin it for anyone. Definitely worth renting, not buying."
2,Hmm...,"While I realize that they were going with a Halloween or Friday the 13th vibe with this, I think it fell short. Being trapped in a booth where you can see out all sides and always see the attacker takes away the suspense VERY quickly. What made the original Halloween and Friday the 13th movies somewhat scary was that you never knew where the scare was going to come from.I admire the cast and director for trying their best at making this movie great. However, for me, I found it very lacking."
1,Boring,"The movie is short, thank goodness for that. The plot was too silly (over an hour stuck in a ATM). The acting was stiff at times, if I was a killer I'd just stand outside the whole damn time????The movie obviously has many flaws and if it was released at a Box Office it would have bombed. I expected something better but just like P2 and other junk films called ""Thrillers"" this movie was not that."
2,There's 3 of them and 1 of him...c'mon now,"Are people that willing to be victimized? The flip side is why not make a movie about being terrorized in an ATM booth/building with 2 young,strong men (to use the term so loosely) (?) and a pretty lady (who had brain and courage potential, but movie/director did not allow it). So they borrowed the fur trim hoodie dark winter coat from the terrorizer/serial killer from the film, URBAN LEGENDS, and added a senseless man who lives out of a storage garage to map out his next ATM victims. What got to me the worst is why did they park so far from the ATM in the first place in the dead of night on a below freezing evening??? This is just a bad horror movie with good young actors (I love Alice Eve) but the characters were non-logical and ready to be victimized. Skip this movie."
2,Stupit plot,"This was a stupid movie. No real character development, and the protagonist motives were just plain silly. Don't waste you time or money with this film. There are much better thrillers to watch."
2,Intense....but ended flat,"ATM was definitely an intense movie with a solid script. Unfortunately, the end was disappointing. Plus, so many scenes were unrealistic. Now, why would three people stay in the ATM instead of confronting the thief or running for their lives.Poor ending...the movie could of used about 15 more minutes to clear everything up."
1,Rip off of P2,"Watching this, I couldn't help but think the director saw the far better P2 and thought ""if I put it in an ATM and tweek it a bit, no one will recognize that superior movie is being ripped off."" Only I'm one of the 500 or so that has seen and appreciated P2. Brian Geraghty is too good to be in this movie. He was a major character in The Hurt Locker. He deserves better."
3,very thick,"I am not certain if I just chose the wrong model for my car, but this tool is very big and rather thick. It did not fit behind my window handle without scratching."
4,Did The Job,"I used this tool to replace the crank on my '97 Honda Civic. It worked. It took a few attempts to get it right, however. I'd say it's worth the money."
3,Not Coven's original,"I hate to burst anyone's bubble, but the version of ""One Tin Soldier"" by Coven on this CD is not their original. The original Coven version was on Warner Brothers and charted in 1971 to # 26 on the Hot 100. This CD's version was a re-record (although arranged and conducted by the same person, Mundell Lowe) and released on MGM Records, and charted almost two full years later, to # 79. Five months later, the Warner single re-charted to # 73. Further, the Coven version (both, actually) are better and more impassioned than the Original Caste version, which suffers from an overstatement of ""mellow"". The Warner's version of ""One Tin Soldier"" is available on volume 7 of Rhino's ""Have A Nice Day: Super Hits of the 70s"""
3,"""Tin Soldier"" is NOT the hit version.","The earlier reviewer was correct in noting that the version of ""Tin Soldier"" here is NOT the original hit version. The hit version was originally released on Warner Brothers 7509 (45 RPM Record) in 1971 and reissued by Warner Brothers 0101 (45 RPM Record) at the very end of 1973. The version here is a new and different recording which was released on MGM 14308 earlier in 1973."
4,Great Tunes From The Sixties,"At first I was a little skeptical about purchasing this CD because of the many renditions and remakes that are out there. Especially at such a low price (it would cost more to download these individually). I only had two concerns when hearing the disc and these are no biggies but I thought I'd mention them. First, all the songs sound great and as I expected but ""One Tin Soldier"" is the only one I question as to whether it's the original recording. It sounds close but I am not familiar enough with it to be sure. All the other songs sound to be true and original. Secondly, the sexy little romp ""Jungle Fever"" I was not familiar with at all, so it was a surprise addition for me when I first played the disc. Overall, this is a great buy!"
3,One Hit Wonders A Hodge-Podge Of Golden Oldies,"This is an interesting but not overwhelming assortment of one hit wonder oldies. It gives you everything from the Monster Mash to the Singing Nun. As a collector I purchased this set for Every Mothers Son's Come On Down To My Boat and Keith's 98.6. There are some other good songs on the CD, but I already had them on various Rhino collections. This is a collection you would be more likely to purchase for one or two particular songs."
3,Hard to find songs,"This is a great CD for the one or two songs you may want but can't find anywhere else. Don't expect the entire CD to be filled with great songs, but it's worth it if you really want one or two of its songs."
4,More hits than misses,"I had been willing to spend the money on this cd just to get ""One Tin Soldier"" by Coven but got a pleasant surprise to find the other gems among the rest of the music. It was well worth the money."
2,not what I remembered it being,"Just not the ""hits"" I was looking for..stupid of me! You really should go back and look in detail at things on your ""later"" list before ordering."
4,Very sturdy and protective case,"I've been extremely happy with the Pelican Micro cases. I use them to store portable external hard drives. The cases are very protective and are very well made. Though they are plastic, they seem to hold up well to use and abuse. And they're made in the USA!"
3,Tries hard with a low budget,Not what I was expecting. Story is not horror but instead makes you feel for the creature. Nice twist. Seems like a really low budget film that tries hard but lacks many technical aspects and effects that a bigger budget production could have had. Somewhat entertaining. Nice try.
1,Requires Many Coats Due to Lack of Pigment,"So bad I returned it. It was like clear paint with some pigment mixed in. (Yes, I shook it for 2 minutes before using). Would have taken 3 or 4 coats to do what Rustoleum spray paint does in 1 or 2 coats. Horrible.Maybe I just got a bad can. In that case, 1-star for feeble quality control. A paint company should know better."
1,This was a mess!,"The can was a disaster! The new ""comfort spray"" did not work well at all, and seemed to drip paint everywhere rather than actually spray. I was covered in paint after trying to use it a couple of times before giving up. Very wasteful, messy, and annoying. Will definitely not be purchasing anything with the ""comfort spray"" grip again."
2,Disappointment,These did not work out as anticipated. Once the studs were installed I started installing the aluminum nuts. The threads seemed very rough. One position on each of the sbf valve covers lacked the necessary clearance to accept the aluminum nut. I traded them out for some chromed steel T-handles that worked much better.
1,Not what they once where!,"I have worn Top-siders since the 70's. They have always (up until now) been my favorite shoe.I don't fault Sperry going to China like most shoe company's, but there seamed to be no quality controls with there shoes now. A boat shoe should not bleed dye on your feet for months when they get wet. This is my first pair that the top stitching up by the laces pull out on both shoes. Now both soles have separated from the leather uppers. Sperry has lost a life long customer!Sperry Top-Sider Men's Authentic Original 2 Eye Boat Shoe"
1,These things are actually dangerous,"They must have changed the soles on them. They are incredibly slippery- and not just on wet surfaces. Wood floors, carpet and worst of all, boats. It's like having ice skates on. Also wrote to manufacturer to let them know. Only response was that they'd replace them. Oddly, I am not interested in owning more of these awful shoes. Find something else. These are not the Topsiders we all knew in the past.I even tried to scuff them up some so that they'd be less of a hazard. Doesn't really help. I am throwing them in the trash."
2,Who forgot quality control?,"I loved my old topsiders but I bought another pair recently and after a month the new ones look worse than the old pair. The stitching is frayed and torn around the ball of my foot. The sole is slick, it is like the rubber is dehydrayed. The soles are slick on wood, tile, and concrete and I don't dare take this new pair near water. I am sorely disappointed in Sperry."
1,huge dissappointment,"like so many others, i have worn topsiders all my life...can't tell you how many pair, and all were comfortable, dependable, and lasted. i have bought three pair in the last three years and they are all terrible. the quality in every dimension has worsened. the sides are shorter, weaker, less robust. but my current and frightening problem? the soles are slippery. not so much in the wet, but on slick dry surfaces and even carpeting. they slide dangerously.i have no idea if this is related to offshore production or not, nor do i care. i just wish there were high quality boat shoes out there, just as sperry's were before."
1,Not who you would think it is!,"Imago DeiJust a fair warning for those interested in the study of the great Byzantine Orthodox Father, Saint Maximos the Confessor: THIS IS NOT HIM.! Read carefully the book description on the author. He is a contemporary California guru who likes to tinker with motorcycles. Maybe the previous reviewer did find great spiritual enlightenment from this book -- but it is NOT the spiritual enlightenment you will find from the real Saint Maximos the Confessor. INTSEAD, BUY AND READ:Maximus Confessor: Selected Writings (Classics of Western Spirituality)Maximus the Confessor (Early Church Fathers)Cosmic Liturgy: The Universe According to Maximus the Confessor (Communio Books.)"
2,Wasn't what i thought...,"I mistakenly ordered this thinking it was the second BIBLE arc trivia. The seller ([...])very graciously allowed me to return it for the BIBLE version (Version 1).I bought the Game Wave console believing it came with the BIBLE version game but it did not. My family played the original Arc Trivia game on Christmas day, only to find questions and videos of material we were not interested in or found even to be offensive. After purchasing the BIBLE version of Arc Trivia from [...], we found it to be very enjoyable and informative. Would be a great game to play at a youth group meeting or small group fun night."
1,"Horrible ""Romantic"" ""Comedy""","If I hadn't spent over $20 to see this movie, my wife and I would have walked out of the theater. It was painful to sit and watch Reese's character go back and forth to that scumbag (played by Owen Wilson - who, btw, was the BEST part of this movie, ironically. But when Owen Wilson is the best part of a movie... something's wrong.)I'm a fan of the entire cast - Reese, Paul Rudd, Jack, obviously - but their characters' huge flaws made them totally unbelievable.It's not funny. It's not romantic. It's just a bad movie. (and not the good kind)"
1,Don't Bother,"I normally watch a movie until the end, but I gave up halfway through on this one. Script terrible. Most of the time people are on the phone calling each other. The story not interesting at all.The cast is great, but I guess they don't have anything to work with. For example Jack Nicholson have made so many great movies like 'As Good As It Gets', but this one is just not funny.Two separate plot lines, but neither gets anywhere. Witherspoon is a professional athlete and gets fired from her job, and Paul Rudd as George loses his job because of a tax fraud.Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
2,How do you know,Not really a very good movie. I love Reese Witherspoon and expected the movie to be much better. I was very disappointed
1,Poorly Written / Acted,"We read the reviews and they said don't waste your time. We did it anyway .... REALLY, don't waste your time with this movie."
4,How Do You Know purchased from Amazon.,"Just received How Do You Know with Reese Witherspoon, Owen Wilson, Paul Hudd and Jack Nicholson. I had seen it on Cable and liked it well enough to want to own it. It arrived quickly and in good condition. I especially like the person who played the secretary. She seems so genuine."
2,Depressing,"Efficient acting, unique characters, fresh cinematography. But it's all new lipstick on an old pig. The most successful female athlete in the world is forcibly retired due to declining speed and endurance. The obvious solution is a rich new lover. Though his bedroom is a revolving door of hot chicks, she moves in. Though he makes it clear he has sex on trips, she clings for dear life until the next lover boy makes her a better offer. Sad."
1,another Sony title with a cinavia polluted audio soundtrack,This is another Sony blu-ray release that has a lossless audio track that has been polluted with the cinavia corruption.Don't buy it. Tell Sony to spend our hard earned dollars on increased features and top quality pq/aq instead of harming the lossless audio sound that we value in our blu-ray purchases with hidden audio signals that can are reproduced by speakers and able to be recorded via a microphone.
1,Huge disappointment,"How Do You Know was a huge disappointment for me. The story line was crazy and all over the place. I love Reese Witherspoon, she's such a great actress, and I was excited to see this all star cast, but the acting was horrible. We ordered this on PPV during a storm and our satellite kept cutting out some parts, and in all honesty, I'm glad it did."
4,it was.........different.,"I just finished watching and i kind of feel like i'm having an out of body experience. i think i'm still trying to process..as a fan of the romantic comedy genre, i got used to a certain formula. but this movie doesn't really follow the typical sequence these movies usually go through. i loved all the differences between paul rudd's character and owen wilson's.. they were great..i could see their characters being studied in a film class or something. reese's character annoyed me to no end. there's a difference between being charmingly neurotic and and just having no clue. it makes me wonder if it was written that way or if the director gave her notes suggesting she play it that way. i don't know, i think for the most part i liked it..but i wish she had been more self possessed. more forceful and not so wishy washy.."
2,didn't like the movie,"It was in good condition but didn't like the movie and didn't keep it. I like other Reese Witherspoon movie's ""Sweet home Alabama"" and Just like heaven."
2,"Not that great, a waste of $!","Not really happy with this movie! I love romantic comedy's but this one was not good. If you like how to lose a guy in 10 days, life as we know it and ugly truth like I do. This movie doesn't compare to how good the other romantic comedy's are!"
1,Not impressed...,"I really like Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd, and Owen Wilson, but this movie was a bomb. I went to the theater to see it, and I was really disappointed. Not worth the money. Rent it if you have to see it."
1,SOOOOO Bad!!!,"How could anyone rate this more then one star? This movie was not funny, the story made no sense. What a waste of money and time."
5,Elated,I loved the movie so much that I had to have my own personal copy for my Blue Ray player.Amazon sent it to me in record time. Thank you.
2,could have been ALOT better,"the cast: a great lineup, love reese in just about all of her other films, and Paul Rudd too, and Jack, well seems he would only choose something that was special and would flow. I saw the plot and it seemed like it would work... only 2 hours later by the time the credits were rolling, for me, it didn't work. I found myself struggling to even finish the movie. I even stopped a few times to do other things and came back to it. The script and lines, just didnt seem to flow and weren't genuine. Even a couple of unecessary F bombs, which was surprising for a PG-13 movie. The chemistry between, actually both on screen couples, Owen & Paul just didnt seem to be there.. Just a disappointment because with some tweeking to the script and other things, this movie could have had good potential at being really good. Sorry, can only give this romantic comedy 2 stars, thats for effort."
5,Loved it!,"I loved this movie in every way! There is always hope and you never know what will happen. ""we are all just one small correction away"" ... I loved the chacters and paul rudd steals the show!"
1,A dud of a film.,"All the pieces were here: Jack is awesome, Owen makes me laugh, Reese has a wonderful track record for these types of films and Mr Brooks is a fantastic writer/director. So why the one star? Simply put, because it was an awful film from start to finish. I felt like I had been dropped into the film after missing the first hour. Nothing was likable or explained clearly. How long has Reese been seeing Wilson? What did Rudd do at his fathers company? 2 of many questions I found myself asking. The story borders on tedious and almost ridiculous dialogue. Just wasn't very well thought out or put together. Even the actors chemistry felt strained for the most part. I dislike writing negative reviews, but having bought my mother this Blu Ray for Christmas (she did enjoy it), I felt like at least commenting that this film was no picnic to watch."
2,"2 Stars for the Plant, 1 for the Movie","The only reason I'm giving this movie 2 stars instead of 1 was because of one scene. When the two characters, George and Lisa, are coming out of the hospital, my wife pointed out how there was a potted plant just randomly sitting on the floor of the revolving door. Somehow, just seeing this one lone plant go around and around in a circle struck us both very funny and we laughed, about the only time in that whole movie that we did laugh. The movie left so many things unfinished, and by the time it was over neither of us cared who ended up with who."
2,"Some characters great, some not so much","Although the reviews here and the online rental place mostly bad reviews, I put the movie in my queue because I like all the actors. I don't mind at all that a movie slowly builds on it's characters but for me, I felt that George (Paul Rudd) really wasn't all that interesting or endearing enough to draw me in or to get the girl. The end is pretty obvious but still I was hoping for more to like about George."
2,I just didn't like it,"I like the actors, but not in this movie. It just didn't really flow that well. The acting seemed forced and the story line weak. I decided to watch it on Demand seeing it was one of the 1.99 days so I went with it. Knowing what I know now I don't think I would have watched it until it was free on TV/Cable."
2,Really not worth it,"I was prepared to like this movie despite the tepid reviews; I like Reese Witherspoon quite a lot, and Paul Rudd is watchable even though he seems to play the same character in every movie (he seems capable, so someone should write a better part for him). But this movie was downright boring; even the actors seemed bored and listless in each scene. Owen Wilson may have had a bit of fun, but he was the only one. And Jack Nicholson was plain awful in his role as Rudd's father.I'm sorry, but this review is as boring and pointless as the movie so I'll stop here. I do blame the director and scriptwriter more than the actors, though. In short, a disappointment despite modest expectations--a movie to skip."
2,"Uninteresting writing, great cast","It was watchable, but there were many times when I was dying for the scene to be over and the next to start. The story was good, the actors were great. Reese Witherspoon is adorable and played the part well. Paul Rudd did a great job. But the dialog and the pace were not good. And poor Jack Nicholson. I wish he had better lines.My GF liked it and I didn't mind sitting through it, but it is two or three stars at best."
1,Boring,"The movie was a waste of time!Awful Dialogue!Bad Story!Weak Dialogue!Truly Boring!Trust me, if you're looking for a nice romantic comedy to watch with your spouse over the weekend, this movie is not for you"
1,Waste of Time,"IF I could give this movie zero stars I would; terrible, wordy script, over the top acting by Owen Wilson and Jack N (who is horrible), stupid story. How do quality actors and producers/directors let this kind of junk make it to the big screen? Do not even spend a $1 on this as a rental. My DGF, a movie lover, fell asleep early on, so I had to stick with the film for much longer than I wanted while she snoozed. Yuck!"
1,Terrible!,"I love movies and hardly ever leave a review but I had to for this one. This movie was bad, bad, bad. I was really looking forward to receiving it because of the wonderful cast but 30 minutes into the movie, I turned it off and hadn't a clue what the movie was about or where it was going. Don't rent or buy it!"
1,Is it over yet?,"OMG, I thought this movie would never end. I shut it off several times because I could only take so much at a time. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it only got worse."
1,Can't figure out what this movie was about,"Can anyone tell me what they were trying to do? Such a terrible script. The actors tried so hard, but there was literally nothing for them to do."
1,I didn't like it,"I had trouble sitting through this movie, and was glad i didn't spend much to see it. You don't really care for most of the characters and you know how it will end from the start. I would say my favorite was the pregnant assistant. I would not recommend this movie to anyone to see. Its just kinda blah."
1,This movie escaped...it was not released,"I gave this movie a generous one-star as fewer stars appear not. If you want to view a movie that has a completely pointless screenplay, in-the-box acting to the point where everyone forgot their acting lessons, this movie is for you. If you want to literally waste 1.5 hours of your time when you could be watching dust particles float by, you have found the right movie. If this is a comedy-drama, I failed to see the comedy and the drama was misdirected. The whole time my wife and I looked at one another and asked, ""Do I laugh now?"" Sadly, Nicholson wasted his true talent and time on this tripe and stupid movie. Boring, inane -- instead of ripping off another studio's idea for a movie, Hollywood is now employing middle school teen girls to write screenplays. And to all the other middle school teen girls who are doing other things, my sincere apology."
1,The movie that went completely nowhere.....,"When I saw Owen Wilson, Reese Witherspoon, and Paul Rudd all in the same movie, I thought there might be some magic in it. Boy, was I wrong. This was an hour and a half move that went absolutely NOWHERE. It was one of the most boring movies I think I've ever seen in my life. I was begging for the climax of the story to come to fruition, then when it did, I just ended up wishing I'd turned the movie off a half hour before.What a complete waste of time watching this pathetic movie."
2,How do you know not to bother?,"Not horrible, she (Reece) is cute, but we really dont know much about her once the movie is over. She is quite adept at a facial expression that would make you think she is just as perplexed as you are a regarding what this movie is about. You have some major names in this movie, and James L. Brooks is great at dialogue, but at the end of the movie I just didnt end up caring who she ended up with. Not a total waste of time I guess, maybe a good movie to watch when your hungover."
1,How do you know if you shouldn't watch this?,"this is possibly the worst movie I've seen in as long as I can remember. And I'm a sucker for sappy, pointless love stories. This is just really bad. The dialogue is awful, the story line is worse. There is really nothing redeeming about this movie. Nothing."
1,AWFUL!,"This movie was horrible. We weren't expecting much, just a cute, romantic comedy. The script was bad. The characters were vapid and uninteresting, and even the acting was POOR. I expected more from Paul Rudd, but he was bland. Reese Witherspoon played a disgraceful woman- she was a shame to strong women everywhere with her character falling for a cheating, horrible man and she was supposed to be ""smart.""The plot went nowhere, and it was really boring."
4,a fun film,I really enjoyed the movie. The previews looked funny and was a bit sceptical from the critics...but I am glad I went ahead and rented it here. I laughed a lot..and enjoyed the slow paced gradual prgression. Its not a serious film..not meant to be...but a look at how not to take life too seriously and enjoy the moments each day and persons has to offer. Not deep....but digs just a little to make me glad I saw it.
2,Falls WAY flat,"This movies fell VERY flat for me. I was disappointed in every aspect of it. From the lack of chemistry between Reesce and Josh, that at many times felt simply awkward, even in the final scenes. Reesce's character seems unbelievable and too hard edged for her. The funny parts were in the preview, and even some of those only seemed funny in the context of the preview, but in the movie....not so much.I expected it to atleast be somewhat funny, or heart warming or whatever it is I seem to get from my beloved array of cheesy chick flicks, but this one was a waste of time and money I hate to say."
1,lame,"As said by another review on here,long boring movie about nothing. Not funny and I couldn't wait for it to be over."
1,Painful,"How does a movie like this get made? Cast seemed strong, all actors I respect and like. But story, scenes and dialogue were painfully bad. Kept waiting for something interesting to happen."
5,Happy,I really loved this cd. It had a lot of the old Christmans song and the artists are great. You really should give it a try especially if you like the Motown sound.
3,An average cd with a few good tracks,"This cd has a few good tracks, if you are in the relaxing mood and wishes for some background music. I have often heard this type of music played in New age bookshops and it has some merit. The only thing is that it gets to be a bit monotonous after a while, so long breaks between listening is recommended."
1,A total disappointment,"I'm sorry I have to disagree with the previous reviewer. This album was a great disappointment to me, it sounds like Goodall has just rehashed bits of music from loads of his previous albums, except he's put on Indian sound effects this time (some of them even blatantly nicked from the film ""Dances With Wolves""!!!)I used to be a great fan of Medwyn Goodall, but after buying this, my 6th album of his, I'm rapidly of the opinion that the man just plagarises his own music time and time again... be it ""Earth Healer"", ""Great Spirit"" or ""Goddess""... it just sounds ALL THE SAME!!!I'm putting these albums straight onto EBay I'm afraid... this guy's time has past."
2,FALSE CLAIMS OF LONGEVITY,"This product claims to have a minimum of 1000 hours of life. I have had to purchase 8 in the last 2 years. Out of the 8, only one has lasted over 600 hours. The projectors that use these bulbs have an hour counter for total use and for bulb use. So, my numbers are not estimated, they are actual readings from the projector itself."
1,Order canceled,My order for this item was canceled by amazon for no reason. So I am looking elsewhere.
5,Rare Verdi rarely done,"This is a fairly minimalist production, but it serves the drama decently. Luisa has a lot of scenic changes and it could hold up the drama. I am not too familiar with Luisa. I've only heard it as I made traversals of the entire Verdi canon. And it did not stand out - until now. Maybe its because I haven't heard any Verdi in a while, but I was really struck by the music this time. It is a wonderful piece and I do not entirely agree with some who claim the first two acts are throwbacks and the third forward looking. It does not fall apart but is a united work of art. The singers are dependable. Of course Anderson is outstanding. And Ichihara the tenor is more than adequate. He's no Pavarotti or Domingo but it is also nice to hear someone else in the tenor role. We are not likely to get another Luisa and its good to have such a good one here."
2,Nothing to recommend this DVD,"This DVD seemed reasonably priced, and reviews not bad. Sadly the whole opera was below standard.June Anderson, really rough at the lower register, and a suspicion of out of tune toward the end of the performance.. Miller sung by Edouard Tumagian, very poor, reaching for most of his notes, and lost at the higher register. Plishka rough. Rodolfo, sung by Taro Ichihara not impressed. And the orchestra had a great time with the tympani, boom, boom. FORTUNATELY Susanna Anselmi, together with Romuald Tesarowicz lifted the performance.I must admit the standard I set was based on a CD with Moffo, Macneil, Verret, Bergonzi, Tozzi and Flagello."
1,Don't fit,"Bought these tracks when I purchased a train set. The tracks took forever to ship, then when they did arrive, imagine the disappointment on my son's face when they didn't fit the track from the train, although the description said they would. Would not recommend."
1,At the bottom of books on pitching,"Although there is some useful information to be found in this book, I see it as the least helpful of the many books that I have read on developing proper pitching mechanics. I find far too many inconsistencies, omissions, inaccuracies, incomplete or erronious explanations, and unsubstantiated conclusions to be of much use to the aspiring athlete or the inexperienced coach. If young pitchers are serious about developing their potential, and if coaches are concerned about sending their players the right message, I believe that they would find books by Tom House, Joe McFarland, Bob Cluck, or Dick Mill's pitching letter much more helpful."
3,Great ideas but...,"I was a little disappointed in this book. I just recently started quilting and ordered several books. I ordered this one primarily because I loved the quilt on the cover, and figured that I would like the other quilts. Well, the one on the cover is one of the few that uses those vibrant, rich colors. Many of the others use light-colored, ""busy"" fabrics that I don't really care for. It's a matter of taste, of course, but the cover is somewhat misleading. That said, the quilt patterns are beautiful and I can just use the colors I like. It's not a beginner's book, but it didn't present itself as one. I think it's a worthy addition to an extensive quilting library, but not if you're planning to just have a few quilting books..."
5,Passionate Patchwork,"Okay, I love Kaffe Fassett stuff. Beautiful pictures of some wonderful quilts that are made form simple blocks, but look complicated.Great books for new quilters that need some color suggestions to get that real POP they maybe looking for.this is not the first book I have of his nor will it be the last."
4,Quilts without the pain.,"His use of color is so amazing that I forget they are simple, repetitive designs. I can look at any one of Kaffe Fassetts books and forget about winter."
1,Awful,"Cynical awful film, poorly done, poorly acted and misleading. Joel McCrea is not the star of it. His bland son Jody is. Joel Mcrea hardly has any lines and appears only at the beginning and the end, mostly riding on horse with nothing to do."
1,"cry blood,or i really bought this?","it doesn't matter who is the real star here or who you thought it was because this is an ok time killer,and nothing more! but this transfer is the pits. fade outs,sound drops and it looks like they transferd it from a 9th generation vhs tape. save your money and look for a better print if you want this one!"
1,Not worth the $3.97,"I bought this movie for Fistful of Lead, turns out its the same movie as I Am Sartana, Trade Your Guns For A Coffin, with a different name. Very Dissapointing. I have seen Cry Blood Apache, which is a great movie, but is also on almost every single Mill Creek Western collection out there. Do yourself a favor, and get theGunslinger Western Collection. This has two Sartana films, and is a much better collection, IMO. I almost forced myself to watch The Gunfighters, but I got sick of it within the first five minutes, maybe I can give it another shot, but the thought that i speant $4 on movies I already own is not appetizing. I watched Django Kill instead, and it was amazing! Look for it on theSpaghetti Western Collection. You won't be dissapointed with that collection."
3,Festive MOTOWN,"CHRISTMAS TIME WITH MOTOWN is a small collection of eight songs recorded during that label's classic era, mixed with two more modern tracks. There's no liner notes to speak of, and no running times are given.Two of these ten cuts are labelled as BONUS TRACKS-- does this really mean that the original album was only eight songs? If so, how absurd! In spite of this lack of numbers, its always nice to hear our old favorites in a relaxed Yule mood. CHRISTMAS TIME WITH MOTOWN is a pleasant little holiday collection.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 31:11"
1,Leaks and birds have no interest.,"The product leaks until there is very little left in it causing my balcony to be very sticky. I used a cheaper feeder before and had Humming Birds all day, with this one they just stopped coming. Yellow and red attracts the birds so this is pretty useless in blue. Would have returned if the postage and restocking cost had not been so high."
5,What! No CD?,"David Kiffer is right on target, Live from the Showboat is an exemplary live performance by a truly fine group. I've pretty much wore out my double disc vinyl set and surprised that the CD release is ""unavailable"". Given the stature of the personnel I suspect that there are many who would purchase this product including myself. This is a very fun set. I guess you have to go to Alaska and Washington State to find the truly hip. butch smith vashon, wa."
1,Liberal Bias,The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is predicatable as soon as the author reveals her liberal bias.
1,Let Down in Little Rock,After reading over half of this book I was wondering why keep going. I thought this award winning book would get much better. It did not.
3,"Slow Starter, but finishes pretty well","It took me a while to start enjoying this book. There are a number of subtle references to current pop culture (commercials, country songs, coffee salons) that feel extraneous to the story and don't really add to character or plot development.On the plus side, that seemed to diminish by the second half of the book, the plot picked up and there were plenty of surprise twists to keep me guessing.Overall, it's a decent light read, but its a far step from great literature."
3,Laura Lippman's Mysteries,"Lippmann's Tess Monaghan is gradually growing on me. I have read three of the Monaghan novels. Couldn't get into Monaghan's view of matters, life, weird sense of humor at first. Good for a light read."
3,A Good Tess Book,This is a solid addition to the Tess Monaghan series. What it lacks in characterization is made up through a solid setting and some very good plot twists. It is interesting to read Lippman's books in order to see how Tess grows and also how the author develops better stories and mysteries.
3,Authentic,This toy truly looks and feels like as if today was the mid 20th century and you just got home with the latest and greatest new toy inspired by Hollywood. Much more authentic than normal toys you buy today.Klaatu Barada Nikto
2,Gort wind-up toy,I got this item for my husband as a silly Christmas gift because he likes Gort. He liked it and it stands on our shelf unit with the Devo Doll he bought last year. It is more for amusement than actually playing with.
4,Good book so far.,"As a thirteen-year old, I bought this book at Borders as part of my birthday money. It's a wonderful book on checkmating (maybe one of the bests). Although I'm only up to chapter two, the rest of the book will probably be good too.However, if I could have looked at every checkmating book on Earth, I probably wouldn't have bought this. For example, Fred Reinfeld's ""1001 Brilliant Ways to checkmate"", probably beats this book by a mile. It's slightly cheaper, I think, and has 698 more diagrams! (I haven't bought this book, but look at the reveiws for it, and you'll know why I'm saying this.)Even though this probably isn't the greatest checkmating book you can get, it's good enough, and will keep you busy. One more thing: I suggest that you get a used one, because if you want to use about $12.00 or so on a book, don't use it on this one."
3,Ok...but better books out there.,"This is book gives you 303 ""tricky"" checkmates. These mates range from queen sacrafices to pawn promotion checkmates. Most of the problems are so hopeless for the opponet(when you play white black has losing chances). at a glance I could figure out sevral ways to destroy the oppenent without checkmating him. This made solving the problems seem pointless. Don't buy this book if you haven't read 1001 brillian checkmates and 1001 combinations. You get more instructive problems for less. An okay book all-around but much better puzzle books are out there."
3,"Good storytelling, but...","The author writes well and can spin a yarn, and the first four stories are standouts. Past the fourth though the collection starts lose some variety and edge. It isn't the ubiquitous problematic husband that's tiring, but just the way this character is approached again and again, seeming to have the same voice over and over. Plus, some of the stories are too long and talky. That said, if you're wanting to see the same sad, inarticulate husband or marriage examined in several scene changes, this is your book.Some great stories still, and every one is graced with fine sentences. ""For Those of Us Who Need Such Things"" and ""The Reason Was Us"" are really great stories and definitely worth the admission price."
4,Description of the supply logistics for Desert Storm,An excellent anecdotal book on logistics by the retired general who deployed the massive resources for American military participation in the Persian Gulf.
4,Nice book for military and general reader,Wonderful took down the course of logistics in the Gulf War. Writer's military career was offered special administration skills that to be worth to consultation by business manager and all military officers.
2,"Too much Pagonis, not enough logistics","As a logistician, I bought this book in the expectation that it would enhance my professional knowledge. It didn't, and it didn't stay on my bookshelf, either.Written for the general reader in the profession of management, this book will enlighten no one in the profession of arms. The treatment of military logistics is all too shallow (and the treatment of the author all too deep).Gus Pagonis did a magnificent job in the Gulf under incredibly difficult conditions. I had hoped that this work would tell us in some detail how he did it. But no. I suspect his editors at the Harvard University Press had a lot to do with that. It's too bad the publisher wasn't Presidio Press or some other house that understands military affairs."
3,Fascinating read on moving things around the world,"This truly is a fascinating account of just how the United States military was able to move 500,000 troops and all their equipment halfwar across the world, fight a war, and then bring it all home. The numbers and statistics of the effort are truly stunning.I am no logisticians and perhaps have missed some of the finer points of leadership as a logistician that this book apparently provides. Nevertheless, it can be an interesting for anyone who is interested in just how the US military works and what a complex organization it really is.Gen. Pagonis only has one flaw - his ego. He really does talk himself up in this book. If one should trust his account of his military career he singlehandedly saved an entire company from annihilation in Vietnam, preserved the M1 Abrams tank program from Congressional hostility, and then did the entire logistical planning and execution surrounding Desert Storm.But if one disregards Pagonis ego this is a great book."
1,Disappointment,"I bought this for the song ""Just Friends"" by Charlie Parker -- this album needs to be digitized-the music sounds muted/or in monotone. Very disappointed.. ButI purchased the album Late Night Sax and got what I needed in this particularpiece..."
4,Line Powered Caller ID,I bought this phone because it was one of the few line powered phones I could find. My only complaints are that the display is hard to read but not impossible and the in use light blinks all the time (why?). It does what it says it does so I am happy.
1,Cortelco 8780-Don't Buy it!,"Don't buy it! Terrible product. i wouldn't even give it one star.This thing will not operate properly after you receive a call. After receiveing a call the Message waiting light comes on and no other function works. You have to tap the receiver switch several times to clear the light and that is hit or miss to get the phone to work. Also the ringer is the same, after you receive a call the ringer no longer operates until the Message light is cleared. Phone will not hold any memory numbers and caller ID names and numbers are incomprehensible. Just an all around poor quality product. I guess it is possible I received a lemon, but how can a good Quality Control let such a bad unit get through?"
5,The Hills are Dying with the Sound of Lee,"I happen to live in the Cotswolds, the setting for this beautiful book, this Monet of literature. And, complying with the below reviews, I have to say that Stroud has become a concrete river, choked with litter, sidelined with Burger Stars, neon lights; a MacDonalds is in the blue print stages. Hills are lined with new developments. It's like, and I quote my mother, ""A disease is spreading.""Yet there are places untouched by Americanisms, consumerism, electricity (and here I apologise, as this becomes less of a review, more an account of personal experience). But there are still rivers afloat with leaves, valleys deep that welcome sunsets. They frost the sky in winter, burn it by summer.""There's beauty in decay,"" as someone said. Haven't got a clue who. But there you go. Although dying of shallow needs and commercial interests, snippets of the old way can be found. And in all their glory, too."
1,Great book but poor reader,"I refer to the audio edition. This is a great book, but unfortunately the author is not a good reader. He sounds about 100 years old and gasps out the words. It is not enjoyable to listen to. It might have been better if he quit while he was behind.This book deserves a good reader.There are so many excellent readers around that surely we can have one of them."
5,Cider with Rosie,So pleased to find this old favourite again.This is possibly the best autobiography I have ever read and the illustrated version is beautiful
4,Roboticness,I just purchased this product after seeing the price on Amazon go from $25 to $50. I bought it at hearthsong.com and it was only $15. Why pay $50 for this toy when you can buy three of them for the same price at another website? I can't wait to hear my kids talking robotically!
2,Flimsy made in china product,"It is a flimsy make. After a few stutters it just gave up. The issue is the contact in the on-off switch. Also embarrassed as it was a gift sent to Bangalore, India.Disappointing."
2,Not to use as microphone or teaching purpose,"I was hoping to buy a microphone to use for teaching. From the description of the product, I thought I can use this produce to help louder my voice in the class. However, this product twist my voice. ICANN mother it to teach Chinese class."
3,voice changer,"This is okay as a toy for a while, but my grandson lost interest in it after just a short while."
2,junk,The idea is cool but you can not hear what they are saying. Your mouth needs to be touching the toy in order for it to pick up your voice and it still comes out broken up. Not worth it.
1,It didn't work,"I bought this last year but didn't review it. It sounds neat but the one we received never worked,and couldn't be fixed. Wasn't worth the hassle to return."
1,Voice changer,"I was excited to buy this toy for my daughter and her dad was excited to check it out as well; unfortunately, there just isn't much difference in the adjustments--only about 3 different tones. Pretty disappointing."
3,satisfactory puchase,I recommend the product to boys and girls >3 years old. It is quite noising but it is funny for them. The battery inside are useful. The backaging is minimal. Colours are simply. Probably it could be better if they were lightining. But kid have fun even without.
1,piece of junk. first one didnt work. replacement also didnt work!,"piece of junk. first one didnt work. replacement also didnt work! i finally took the second one apart and fixed it. a very poor design for the trigger switch. the kids do like playing with it, but not sure how long it will last."
2,Does not work well,"The boys, ages 4 and 6, loved it but it is basically just a megaphone and only has a slight voice change despite the option of 8 different voices. It's not very durable and basically just amplifies their voices which is why they love to play with it. It was cheap so not THAT much of a disappointment."
3,You get what you pay for.,"Theres not a lot of variety in the voices, and the volume could be up a bit more, but it's a fun toy for 12 and under."
1,stopped working after one hour,"It stopped working after one hour. I changed the battery, but apparently that was not the problem. The kid is 5 year old girl, she did not play rough with it."
1,voice changer does not change voice at all waste of money,"The only thing I liked at all about this, it came with a battery. It looks cool, but does not change voice at all."
5,Cool Toy!,"I saw a different version of this in Target for more than what I paid here. My son and I bought this as a gift for his friend, and not only did he love it, but my son wouldn't stop playing with it while we were waiting for Christmas to arrive!"
4,Good deal for the price,"I ordered this as just something ""extra"" to give my 11 year old for Christmas. He loves it! Some of the voice sounds are very similar to each other, but for the price, it has kept him entertained!"
3,Better than I expected,This voice changer actually worked better than others I've seen before. My 6 yr old son has played with it a lot. (although it gets annoying for US sometimes) he has had a blast with it! It doesnt break either!
1,Piece of Junk,This toy worked for about 40 seconds. No kidding. It came out of the package. One person spoke through it and that was it ... new batteries didn't help.
1,Poorly made toy,"My son received this toy as a Christmas present and thought it was great...he played with it about a week before it broke. We thought that it must need new batteries, but we put new ones in, and it doesn't work. Overall, I'd say this is a fun toy, but poorly made! He was very disappointed."
1,I ordered it and it was not working!,"I ordered this for my Grandson and it didnt work. I changed the battery and again, not working. It did light up but when I spoke, nothing. I tried fooling around with the switches and again nothing. I packed up the item and called ups and sent the thing back. My Grandson was upset buy I told him that it did not work."
1,cheap!!!!,this things does not change the voices. they all sound the same not even worth the time to return it . money lost.one word CHEAP.
3,Not as fun as expected,"We bought this toy based on one we saw in Chicago. Although this was the same price, the quality is not the same. The voices are not clear and he has not played with it since I bought it for him."
5,More than just a toy,"I bought this for my Granddaughter who is 9 years old but for medical reasons does not talk, however recently she started trying to talk and with this voice changer she is intrigued to try different sounds which I know will eventually be words, this has been a great tool for speechtherapy. Of course I had to get her two year old brother one also because he just loves being heard. This toy is definitly a good buy."
3,Voice Changer - can get annoying,"We bought this toy for my 5 year old son. He absolutely loved it and it works well, almost too well. There is a button to change from simple voice amplification (voice sounds the same just louder) to voice changer (voice sounds digitized and louder). This is fine if you talk through it, not so much so if you have a child, like we do, that likes making loud annoying sounds through it for hours at a time. Toy works great, but know your child before buying. We conveniently ""forgot"" ours at a relatives house on the day we purchased it which was months ago and he still asked when are we going back to visit so he can get it back. He usually does not recall toys that are out of sight, so it really made a big impression. Normally I would feel guilty, but it was so annoying that I actually don't."
3,Not worth it,This toy is a bit better than the cheaper one but I was disappointed with this one too. I thought the voices wereReally going to change. They did make an effort to change but not enough. It has 8 different voices but mostOf them sound the same. I read the reviews and ordered it anyway thinking maybe theirs didn't work. I guessThey were right cause my didn't work either.
4,Funny sounds,"My husband likes this toy, he gets a kick out of it, when his CB friends hears it and cannot figure out who is making the different sounds."
5,My nephew likes it,All I've heard is that it's fun. Educational??? Durable??? I guess it will take a little while to hear about the other ratings but for now - he's enjoying it - he is six years old.
2,ok,"it was ok for small child gift, but the sounds did not really change the voice that much and was cheaply made"
2,Meh...,"My daughter HAD to have this toy....so Santa did her due diligence and checked reviews online, found a good price on Amazon and secured this silly toy. It doesn't work that well. The voices all sound about the same and you have to speak directly into it for it to work at all. My daughter hasn't picked it up much since Christmas. Parents? I'd leave it. There has to be something comparable out there that actually works. Great idea, terrible execution. Pass this one."
2,Not what i spected,"It is not fun because you really can't hear the different sounds> It does't change your voice, you only listen a bad noise, the same for the ten choices."
4,Fun gift and great for parties,The boys really got a kick out of this. Great for birthday parties! Inexpensive and teaches them a little science too
3,Amplifies only very slightly; garbles voice and the controls do next to nothing; does not function continuously,"This is a cute toy for little kids, but mine don't play with it more than some seconds at a time. It lacks power to amplify the voice much at all. The controls to use different voices do next to nothing.This item garbles the voice and amplifies it slightly and not continuously even though you keep the trigger pulled."
3,okay,Its a thing that changes your voice. Who doesnt want their voice changed by using a tool. Who needs vocal chords when we have this to do our magic. Who cares how old you are.?? -as
4,A lot of fun!,"I got this as a gift for a 4 year old nephew and it was a great gift. Its a lot of fun to play with and most importantly, its not too loud. I was a little concerned I was buying a child a megaphone, but it doesn't really amplify the voice at all. It just changes it."
1,Would not buy again,"This toy is cheaply constructed and the voice change capacity is minimal, and the voice quality is terrible. It held my 6 year old niece's attention for less than one minute."
1,Piece o' Kr@p,"When you press the button it makes loud, annoying noises. Many of them are very distorted. A couple of the noises actually do change...slightly...when you speak into the device but it sounds like noise, not a voice. I am generally pretty tolerant of such things -- I am actually quite a bit more into noise than most folks. I can get into a lot of stuff that would drive most folks up the wall. I can be mesmerized by some dishwashers and make and listen to some rather ""experimental"" music. This ""toy"" however is worse than junk -- it is definitely, actively bad."
3,Great Idea for the kids but lost interest quickly,"I bought this for my 3 and 6 yr old boys. They love microphones and I thought they would really enjoy this item. It feels like a solid built toy. The settings for the voice ""changes"" are complicated as they have nothing written on the toy as to what settings to use. If you throw away the wrapper, good luck figuring out how to change it, as trial and error would be your only friend. Also they have to speak so loud into the microphone because of the poor sensitivity that many times you hear their voice above the slowly distorted processed ""computer"" type voice which seems to be on every setting and it loses its appeal. It was a great idea and novelty at first, but they just did not enjoy it as I thought they would. For this price, I should not have expected a high quality voice decoder. We got a toy that doesn't keep them interested."
4,It is cute,"This is a fun toy for my 5 year old grandson. He likes it. He is autistic and likes to hear his voice. The only downfall is that it takes 3 batteries, and also the sounds don't sound that much different. All and all it is a fairly good toy. I give it a 4"
2,Dissapointing,There is very little difference in the different settings and little to no amplification of voice. Maybe I got a bad one but it was just a bust.
2,cheap and almost useless,a voice produced is weak. they'd better used a small recorder inside and made replay possible with various distorsions. it's not worth it
3,Okay,"Great present for the kids - they won't know the difference - but I could tell that half of the settings sound the same (there are 5 rows of on/off settings). Also, you can definitely hear your voice on top of the microphone voice. Again, the kids will love it. My niece and nephew are 8 and 5 and they were fighting over it. I'm sure they will get bored of it but I always buy a comical gift for my sister."
2,Forget About It,"Very crude and not as advertised. Hardly notice changes between various settings. Although cheap to begin with, don't waste your money."
3,great fun,bought for an adult to call kids for dinner in a 4 storied house. Item was co-opted by kids to drive parents nuts. Co-option was successful.
3,Muddled,"It is supposed to change your voice, I know but several family members have tried it and every setting sounds like a struggling Darth Vader. Boy still had fun with it for a while but it lost it's appeal quickly due to the fact no one could understand what you were saying, voice change or no."
4,Good for the Kids.,"The kids are having fun with it, voice does not change much and is hard to understand when speaking, but for the price its not bad for the kids."
3,Not really worth the price,"Was purchased as a bit of a joke for our family Christmas gathering - the kids kind of liked it, but it really does not have 10 distinct sounds - several sound very much alike and it is a bit cheap. Guess you can't expect too much these days for $10 but I think this would be better priced at $4.99."
5,Great for someone elses kids!,I brought this for my neice who thinks this is fantastic. I didn't realise but you can change the sound as well so even better than I thought. My sister thought it was great too and very entertaining. A bit too loud for my house though! Not something i'll be buying for my own children.
1,Doesn't change voice,"This doesn't work, buttons imply that the voice will change but each time you switch the button, the same computerize voice is produced. Disappointing."
1,Not good,"Not good, it just sounds like a broken static feed and nothing more. It does not vary at all, kids didn't like."
5,Great toy for funloving kid of ANY age.,"Arrived promptly, as pictured, no problems. I think my 9 year old grandson will love this one, but would be fun toy for ANY age. Heck, I might get one for myself!"
3,You will probably wind up hiding it like we did,"Yes, kids love this. We've had ours now for about 3 years. My brother and I often joke, ""Why ON EARTH did our mom (their Nana) buy this?!?"" It was obvious a ploy of ""payback"" for our whims that drove her nuts when we were kids! It is super-annoying to the ears, and around our house with four children, I like opting for quieter toys. However, if you can handle it, go ahead and get one. Kids find it really funny, even though my husband and myself are much more stoic about the toy."
2,Almost junk,"It kinda works, but I would not buy again or recommend.It probably cost $1 to make in China & should retail for $3."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"Totally not as advertised and not worth having to pay shipping twice, with a return.Bought this for a little more than some of the others and thinking it would be better. All the sounds are the same."
1,Worked for five minutes,"My kids were SO excited and LOVED this toy...until five minutes after they took it out of the box, it stopped working. No, it's not the batteries; the toy is clear and you can see that the trigger is not connecting to the metal spring inside that completes the circuit. Save your money. Buy the T-Pain Microphone instead. That thing is awesome, easy to use, records short snippets and plays back, and my 4 year old son throws it around like, well, like a 4 year old boy throws things, which is to say, A LOT.Note: I did NOT buy this from Amazon. I bought it somewhere else. Not a bad thing to say about Amazon!But yeah, save your money."
2,Not impressed,"The clarity of the voice with this product is not very good. Most of the voice changing options are garbled sounds. Plus, you have to cup your hand around the mic in order to get enough volume out of it. And I expected the switches to give more dynamic options than they do. They change the voice very little. It was not worth the money I spent."
2,voice changer,"While this toy does what it claims to do, the age is listed as for three year olds. I find that it is difficult to pull the trigger and the buttons on the side which change the sounds are hard for a child that age to get the sound he wants.I think it would be better for an older child."
3,Still works after over a year,At first when the kids opened this for a present last Christmas I was skeptical. It doesn't really change their voice much more than it just causes it to be mixed with a lot of static and a high or low tone depending on the voice modifier settings. However they seem to like it and it still gets played with now and then so I'm giving a 3 star rating. The device is cheaply made but to it's credit has held together for a year.
1,Sounds awful,You can't make out ANY voice on here. Just sounds awful. Returning for refund. Junk! I've tried all the options. They ALL sound the same and done are squeaky.
1,broke the same day,It worked fine for 4 to 5 uses. The design is very bad that if you press the trigger hard the contact might bend for good and the voice changer may never work. It broke the same day that we received it.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED **IT NEVER WORKED,I bought this toy for my nephew for Christmas in 2011 and up to now it never worked. I am all in the way in Trinidad and sending it back will cost me a lot. I am very disappointed my nephew was so sad. I wasted my money and I can't even get it back very frustrating.
1,don't bother,It's pretty poorly made and the sounds it makes are distorted and awful. I bought it for my neice and she was less than thrilled.
2,Not so great!,Bought this for Christmas for my daughter. After unpacking found this to be very cheaply made and has very bad quality of sound coming out even for a toy of this kind.
5,can't decide if it's for adults or children,We had more fun with this thing! My son is 4 and my husband is 31. They nearly 'fought' (not really) over who was going to play with it next. It's really worth it. :)
3,Not as Expected,"I really expected at least 10 different voice changes, but it seems to really only have ONE. The kids played with it and liked it, but not the HIT I expected. It's also hard to hear your own voice when talking in it, so the one using it doesn't hear his/her voice change. It's ok, a little pricey for what you get."
1,loud and possibly obnoxious,"beware- it's a cool toy, but if buying for nieces and nephews, you may annoy the parents with this one"
3,Need Earplugs!,"This was a gift for my son. He loves it. LOVES LOVES LOVES IT. There is NO volume control (on ours) and it is LOUD. If he could control the volume, the toy would be great. But it is LOUD!"
3,Children enjoy it. Adults always try it.,"My grandson is still walking around with his Voice Changer. When he has his friends over, they all partake in it. It's a fun try for adults too. Not sure everyone would feel the same about this. It's definitely worth seeing the look on their face when they hear their voice sound different, but it's not enough to occupy a long period of play time."
4,Probs,Bought 2 for xmas. Thank goodness my wife's a kid and has to play with most toys before wrapping them. One stopped working right away. Seems a wire wasn't making contact inside when you pulled the trigger. A small screwdriver to open it and repair and back in business. the kids loved 'em. ( Ages 3-5)
2,Broken,"I had ordered three, two were broken when they got to me. I tried replacing the batteries, but they still didn't work.The one that was working was great though"
1,A for ANNOYING,"This is the most annoying toy on the face of the planet. A friend sent it as a Christmas gift for my children and now I am wondering if that person must secretly hate us. I also see that this is listed as a gag gift!!! Do NOT buy this toy unless you want to become highly irritated by your children. Of course, since it's a loud, obnoxious toy, my kids love it. It is going directly to the donation bin, good riddance!"
2,The kids like it,I'm trying to find a place to hide it ! It's driving me crazy.It's too loud. The kids scream in it.
3,"The Kids Love it, it annoys the adults.","We have hid this toy many times and our girls keep finding it. They love it. We parents---not so much. I think this might be a good gift to give to OTHER people's kids, but not your own. Be warned. It is fun but gets very annoying quickly."
3,Multi Voice Changer,"It's okay as a grandparent comment. Our 4 yr old granddaughter had fun with it and since it was not very costly - I would rate it ""ok"""
2,Broken out of box,"Not sure if just my bad luck but this was broken out of the box. Because its made of clear plastic, it was easy to see the problem. The trigger was not making contact with a small metal pin inside the handle. I heated up a very small screw driver on the stove, burned a small hole through the handle and pushed the pin into proper possition. It works now but the voice modulation just isnt worth the price or trouble fixing."
2,voice changer,"The voices all sounded the same, I thought it would be a big hit with the grand kids, but it wasn't.."
2,poor quality ... short life span product,"I bought this product because it came up under an ""elmo voice changer"" search. No elmo voice on this product. It is fun and the kids seem to enjoy it. Very low quality product. I don't expect it will last another 2 weeks. Handle is loose and overall quality is bad. If you are looking for a short term fun toy and not too worried about throwing away $10 bucks, this will do."
3,not that great,This toy seems durable enough. The batteries lasted about 6 months. The voice changing was a dissappointment. It is difficult to tell much of a difference between most of the voice changing. They sound pretty much the same and it is near impossible to understand what is being said. But my toddlers like the crackling that came out of it when they made noices in it. I would not recommend to waste your money on this though.
1,"Cheap, way too quiet.",It's just too quiet. You hear your own voice over the toy's. First thing I thought was that the 9-volt that came with it was dead. I tested it and it was fine. Changed it anyway and it made no difference. No volume control either. I would not recommend this at all.
1,Didn't work right out of the box- save your money,Didn't work right out of the box- save your money. Was really hoping this would be a great toy for my niece
2,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this for my 9 year old. I tried all the different switches to change voices. They all sound the same. They just all sound like a distorted voice with a electronic/robotic sound. You can't even understand the words being spoken coming out the other end. The only reason why I have given it a 2 star instead of one is because my daughter enjoyed playing with it on Christmas, even though it doesn't do what it is suppose to do."
3,Just okay,"This was not exactly what I expected. The directions are very complicated for a child who doesn't read yet. There are so many buttons and combinations that you need to refer to the list to choose a particular voice. Although your voice changes, the words come out VERY unclear. It is hard for someone else to understand what you're saying. My 4-year old likes it, but he doesn't know anything different."
4,Kids love this,It works great (though some settings BARELY change your voice) and my son and all his friends and cousins have played with it. It is not unbearably loud either. It has been dropped and handled by all these kids and is still in good shape.
3,It's OK,There are 2 or 3 settings that change your voice but others don't seem to do much but is fun! We got for our grandson but son-in-law had more fun with it!
3,Different,It's not the best toy. My 4 year old plays with it but its staticky and sounds terrible but for him it's good enough.
3,Buy this at TJ MAXX,"This toy is just fine for what I paid for it, which was less than $10 at TJMaxx. I wouldn't pay a nickel more for it than that. My kids played with it a few times and then it went into the toy box."
1,Annoying,"I am sure that some parents with far more tolerance than me will think this is a fun toy. This toy is both annoying and pointless. My son had to have it but thankfully got bored with it quickly. It does everything as described, but after half an hour of listening to it you will want to make it disappear"
1,Poor construction,The first time I pulled the trigger to try to change my voice the hinge where the trigger is attached broke and it didn't work. Shoddy construction. Never really got to hear the voice effects.
1,Waste of money!,Very disappointed. Did not work out of box and had to buy new batteries. Worked for 1 minute and could not get it to work anymore. Would rate it a 0 if I could. Save your money and don't buy this item!!
1,Doesn't work,We ordered this as a Christmas gift and it doesn't work. The battery lights up the lights around the speaker but the product does nothing with the users voice.
3,Just ok,"I ordered this for my son who is just under 20months. It's ok on the one voice, but it's not like the one I had when I was little where it had distinct voices. It's pretty crackly on most of them."
1,Multi Voice - Dont waste your money,Total piece of c$%p. Sound quality was weak and tinny. Very little variation except for a few buttons. Seemed poorly made.
1,Not Happy =(,"I ordered this toy since it had great reviews. However, the voice is not loud at all. My real voice is still louder than the voice changer speaker. I even decided to change the battery, thinking maybe the battery was low. So I had to open the package. FAILED. :("
1,did not like this item at all!,"I purchased this for my grandson. No matter what setting he put the voice recorder on, he sounded the same. I was very disappointed and did not want to take it from him to return it. It was very cheap plastic and I am sure as soon as they drop it, it will break. A waste of money!"
3,Kind of a stocking filler,Needed lots of toys as (as per the list sent to Santa). So ordered this.. it has been a month but it doesnt meet expectations. When used the user gets more screams than voice changes. Next time will get a bull horn. Liked the color combination and looks attractive when held (but not used).
3,Fun toy,This is a fun toy to play with however it is a bit hard to understand when you talk into it! It is also made up of plastic that seems to be a bit fragile! My son loves to play with it though! I would recommend this product!!!
4,Fun for kids and adults,"We got one of these and liked it so much, we bought a second one. It has a half dozen or so switches, each with an up or down position to make various voice changes to choose from. You do have to speak closely to the mike in order for others to hear the changed voice more than your regular voice. But fun for an inexpensive toy."
1,Multi Voice Changer,"This product sounded like a fun toy for a child. However, it is made so cheaply that the on-off switch doesn't work properly-it stays on all the time thus discharging the battery quickly. Don't waste your money. Sue in Michigan"
1,Junk Junk Junk,This toy is an absolute piece of junk. It belongs at the dolaar store. You can't decipher anything that comes out of this voice changer. My kids played with it for all of 30 seconds and then discarded it on the floor. Save your money.
3,Novelty,"Fun toy, but does not project voice very far, and you hear the speaker's original voice just as loud as the modified voice. Not the best voicechanger. If you are looking for something more serious, dont get this one."
3,Not that cool,We thought the kids would have alot of fun with this. I guess we were wrong. Once they realized that it was more of a noise maker than a voice changer they moved on to the next gift.
3,changes sound into not too many sounds,this toy is supposed to change sound into to many sounds but it does it only for tow or three different sounds
2,Meh,"For $10 what can I say, I don't feel ripped off or anything. But this is entertaining for all of 5 minutes then you'll just be annoyed you bought your kids this thing. Everything sounds bad on this, none of the effects are fun, it's really pretty lame. Might make an ok stocking stuffer. Looks like more than $10, but not really fun or entertaining at all. Imagine making a really obnoxious donkey noise like in Godfather 3 on the steps...that's kind of how everything sounds through this."
5,The BEST thing for an over-used voice,"I am a professional singer who is required to sing and speak for hours and hours each day. Not only does this tea soothe my throat when it feels raw from overuse, I also swear it makes me sing better! It doesn't feel slimy like other throat teas, and though at first I was not a fan of the taste, now I find it deliciously comforting and sweet. When I have had sore throats from sickness, it has often been the only product to relieve the pain- and, as an organic tea from a fairly socially/environmentally responsible company, it is a healthy, guilt-free choice! I recommend it to almost anyone... the taste will grow on you if you give it a chance, but to be fair, if you hate licorice, you may just always dislike the taste. Enjoy!"
3,tastes like licorice tea,"To me, this tea doesn't taste like a blend of all the ingredients listed but it tastes like LICORICE tea with a little accents. One would have to like licorice to like this tea in my opinion"
1,Ouch! Loved it at first....,"Bought this for a foster child, so she'd have athletic toys in the yard, and other kids would want to come play. It worked for those, and she loves to twirl and spin on it. I'd say it's great for building upper body strength, takes up a small area, and amuses children for 1-20 minutes at a whack (pretty good for today's child!).PROBLEM: the plastic handle is joined together by screw/bolts. These do not sit prettily together after some use and yesterday 2 neighbor kids got blood blisters using it when it pinched their fingers. Granted, one of them I will be happy not to have return, but I do not like toys that hurt children! I would return it, but the time just expired. Anyone know how to make contact with the company?"
5,Perfect Gift for Grandchildren,We have given a twizzler to each of our seven grandchildren and all of our nieces and nephews.The never wear out and the kids twirl on them into their teens.
1,Not so exciting :-(,We are very disappointed in this product we purchased last summer. We constantly have many kids and adults of all ages over to our house because of our swimming pool and I don't think we have found one person who has done more than try it once then walk away. Also it is difficult to find the right size to hang it becasue of different sized people using it. Not recommended.
1,broke and could have caused injury,"Visiting children aged 5-11 enjoyed it in brief spurts the first summer, and it seemed worth the price. The next year a normal-sized seven-year old tried it, the plastic handle snapped in half, and he fell---fortunately into deep bark we'd placed below for safety. Granted, plastic will degrade in the sun, but shouldn't ""playground"" equipment hold up to the sun for more than a season?"
1,"Plastic handle does not tighten, will pinch hands",The plastic handle comes in 2 pieces with the screws to put it together. It makes no sense why it could not come assembled. It is rubber banded together. We could never get the two pieces together tight with the screws. The two pieces slide just enough that it would pinch a hand that was holding it. We took out the screws and tried 3 different times to get it tighter. I am going to return it. It is a great idea though.
3,youth poncho,"This product is fine, what you would expect. I paid almost as much for shipping as I did for the product. It is ripped already at the neck opening. Not durable enough for my kid."
1,"Get the paper version, not the Kindle version",You save a whole 8 cents buying the Kindle version instead of the paper version. This joke of a pricing difference is going guarantee the eventual failure of the Kindle unless Amazon decides to do something about this.
4,Why have I never heard of Sharpe?,I would recommend this book and this series thus far. Well written. Good character development. Great action. Grounded in historical facts. Can't wait to buy the next book.
4,Love those Brits,Always loved books about the British in India back in the day. So glad I stumbled on this one. Lots of gory battle scenes. Unbelievable the way they fought back then.
3,Sharpes Triumph,"My second read in the series. I'm still getting used to the characters. The bad guy, Sharpes old sergeant seems to have 9 lives. Still, all in all a good read."
4,"Good one, moves along well....","I typically don't like books that depicts battles since I find them hard to follow, but this one I liked. Looking forward to the 3rd in the series."
5,A Rosetta Stone to the Common Criteria,"We all know how bad the security of commercial software can be and now it's time we do something about it. The Common Criteria is a proven method to fixing the woeful state of software security and this book is the key to the front door that leads to the path of provably secure systems. It's useful for students, researchers, practitioners, and software developers who truly want to make a difference in finally bringing trust into an otherwise untrustworthy world."
5,The best!,"As a bit of a candle junkie I've tried just about every brand on the market & Trapp candles are BY FAR the best! They are very high quality & very highly fragranced. The price may seem a little bit expensive but, trust me, it is money well spent. They burn very clean & just one candle is more than enough to completely scent one entire level of my house (3,000 sq. feet). The scents are very fresh & natural - not at all perfumey or overpowering. Without fail, anyone who visits my home compliments them & asks where they can get their own. VERY highly recommend!"
2,they are not worth the money!,"The trapp candles are not worth the money I will not buy any more.I use alot of candles for our business, to have a nice fragrance through our office.These candles have less fragrance than ones you get at walmart, etc. They were a big dissapointment.I will keep them because by the time you pay the shipping and handling cost both ways to get here and to send back it wouldn't be worth it. A very big dissapointment!!These really are a waste of money."
2,Not worth the $$$,"We purchased this toaster from Macy's and were very disappointed. I thought I was buying the Cusinart countdown toaster that has had better reviews.Cuisinart CPT-190 Brushed Stainless-Steel 4-Slice Toaster with Countdown TimerAnyway, this toaster burnt the toast if you went anyhere over level two. So needless to say there is not a great range of browning. We also began to notice the uneven toasting. In addition, the two slots on the right side did not toast consistently with the same exact setting of the slots on the left side.We ended up buying the Krups FEM4b through Amazon and we love it!!! Check out my review of the Krups.Krups FEM4B 4-Slice Toaster, Black"
2,My toast is sad.,"I have had this toaster for 2 years. I have come to learn to work with it.I stand by it and watch for the time to push it up....if not it often burns. I have a toast setting of 3.5 to 4.5. Anything below that and it gives me a pale toast, anything over it and it burns my toast. It also does the toasting uneven.If toast is a big deal to you buy another toaster. I have learned to smother my mediocre toast with butter and a good cup of coffee!"
4,Nuff Raga in Dub,"The best reggae style b movie aroundfilled with crucial roots reggae. Great cameos by big time dj's and artists, ie Jacob Miller performing temnemant yard . Pass the bubblin telephone chalis and control this!!"
5,Great movie,"Great movie, more difficult for me to understand than other movies I've seen from Jamaica...but it was a great move. Enjoyed reading about the actors and band histories. The Glossary was nice, as well, learned some new terms.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie!"
5,SunPro Tachometer,"I purchased this product because I wanted a shift light that I could set. When I'm winding out gears, I don't want to take my eyes off the road. With a shift light,I can keep my eyes on the road and know exactly when to shift.Plus it's a handsome and effective instrument.Satisfied Customer"
3,Massive,"I'll be installing this in my military ambulance, its a good thing my truck is big because this tach is massive. I have no doubt it will perform well, and yeah the measurements are in specifications, but really I was suprised when it arrived... Yeah it's that big."
5,What was the one star review all about?,"The last person, ""a reader"", must have read the wrong book. I thought it was very Stephen King like, but actually readable. if this is a series, where are the other ones?"
3,Over all- good reading,"The stories are interesting,but the author could have done more history investigating,especially for the second story,( the FBI wasn't established until 1908). And proof-reading would be nice,( how can Siamese twins be born two days apart?) The stories themselves are quite imaginative. Over all I enjoyed reading this book."
1,"No, It's Not King or Koontz","It takes much time to achieve that acclaim. If you want 'easier to read' than these authors, one should try the Young Adult section in the library."
1,Could Not Wait......,"to put this book down. It had no depth and was uninteresting. The author needs a life, truly."
5,IT'S THE PICTURES STUPID!,".Years ago I asked a friend for advice in finding a concise and well-edited one volume overview of Gibbon's monumental classic. I told him that I preferred a ""coffee table"" format with copious photographs, maps and illustrations - IF such a work existed.Being that he is an erudite and well-read individual, with undergraduate degree in History from Furman, and MA and PHD degrees in Philosophy from Emory, I felt pretty comfortable with his recommendation when he pointed me to this work.To say that I haven't been disappointed in the abridgment is an understatement; and while I will be giving my charges full versions of TDAF to begin their essential home libraries - probably the Modern Library edition with the Boorstin introduction - they will get a copy of this excellent work too - with my well-founded belief that it will pique their interest to go further afield with the incomparable Mr. Gibbon!"
5,Outstanding Music,Every single song on this album is fantastic. Jason writes real ballads unlike most of the tripe that is out there today. He is truly talented as a musician and a writer. I cannot imagine why he's not famous except for the fact that his songs might make a person stop and think. Heaven forbid!
5,Just perfect,"Sometimes fever words are better. The Sharp Aqous is simply excellent. Easy to install (plug and use), very sharp screen from various viewing angles, the sound is good and the location of the speaker below the screen leaves valuable space for other things on my kitchen countertop. Would definatively recommend this TV set to all my friends (and I have)."
4,"Naruto Uncut Box Set: Season One, Vol. 1",The DvD was transported without incident. It proved playable on our current DvD player and was very entertaining to view.
2,Not pleased about the handling!!!,The episodes are awesome. The only thing I had a problem with was the dvd box. It came all broken inside. Im not going to return it....im just going to have to buy a dvd/cd case. 2 stars for the handling but 5 stars for the episodes.
3,Naruto Uncut Box Set,Cons:The DVD's are scratched. It just shows how low of a quality Viz Media's distribution center is.
5,so so GOOD,"This is the best! This anime will make you want more and more! Don,t like naruto that much. who cares! The story will make you love naruto! Plus there,s Sasuke the cool one and more. Not sure about the rateing will here,s my rateing PG 13 for gore bad words and intense action. This is a must see!"
3,Naruto is a good show ok box though,I ordered naruto season 1 vol 1 and 2 I go them with Great timing shipped and delivered in two day with out prime. Season 1 vol 1 was in great shap but vol 2 had some color damage on the front not two bad but I can deal with it. Any ways good show love the episode on this vol great show.
4,"Naruto Uncut Box Set: Season One, Vol.1","Excellent start of a series, complete with action, information.When buying says Japanese as Language only. This is not true you have the option to have voice in Japanese or ENGLISH."
4,"Naruto Uncut Box Set: Season One, Vol.2",Filled with great action in great detail.When buying says Japanese as Language only. This is not true you have the option to have voice in Japanese or ENGLISH.
4,condition of the disks,"So, I've been a naruto fan since the beginning and I thought it'd be nice to get this for my little brother. But, when I got the disks they where scratched. Despite that, shipping was fast and it was dubbed so my brother enjoyed it anyways."
4,Easy read - good book,"I read a lot of books about dog rescue, and found this bookto be one of the best. It challenges the typical thinking about pet overpopulation and caused me to think."
4,Charming tale of life before WW2,"As other reviewers have noted, this book really captures the essence of growing up on a farm around the time of WW1 and reaching adulthood in the years before WW2.Unfortunately, the book lacks a good introduction and the basic chronology of Peltier's life is very hard to follow, on one page he has just bought his first telescope and just a few pages later someone gives him a 6-inch telescope to sight comets. Mmmmm, there must have been an in-between!The only education alluded to is his completing 11th grade and having a few astronomy books, and yet he's corresponding with major observatories almost from the first.So buy this book for the charm and slice-of-life, especially if you own a telescope, but better look to Wikipedia or something to understand where Peltier fits into the rest of the world."
5,Starlight Nights - Excellent!,"This is one of my all time favorite books. It is the autobiography of Leslie Peltier, a legendary amateur astronomer. It tells the story of him growing up in the midwest and his interest in nature. This eventually led to him becoming an amateur astronomer, discovering several comets (which bear his name), and performing variable star observing and recording for the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO).His writing style shows his early 20th century, midwest upbringing and at times is simply poetic.I've read this book at least 4 times and each time brings a calm and inspiration not common in todays world.I very highly recommend this book to anyone interseted in astronomy, nature or an escape from modern day chaos."
3,"50's-era sci-fi anthology, nostalgic find","I loved this book as a kid just discovering sci-fi in the 70s--long out of print, and actually most of the stories are fairly forgettable. The editor's comments and story introductions are pretty wince-worthy, and the short stories range from pure pulp to a few classics. If you remember this book from child/early teenhood and are thinking of buying a used nostalgia copy, yes--it's pretty much as you remember it!"
5,Review by Author's Son,"I'm very happy to have a good copy of this book written by my Father--I wanted it as a Christmas present to his Great Grandaughter. I'm a little sad to see that it's a library discard, and mixed feelings over the fact it obviously hasn't been read very much and is in very good condition.Louis L. Taylor, Jr."
4,Works well with LG VX8550,"Good product at a good price. Has no charging light indicator, but I knew that. Does it's job."
4,LG VX8350 Mobile Charger,Product was shipped in a timely manner. It worked right out of the box and the price was right. What more could you ask for?
2,Way too small,"I was unhappy with disposable nursing pads so I gave these a whirl. They are WAY too small, so any shifting at all renders them completely useless. I am a 38DD while nursing, so maybe these would work fine for smaller breasted women. I used them a few times at home then threw them in a drawer and haven't taken them out since. Too bad, because they absorbed pretty well the 10% of the time they stayed in place."
3,Meh...at least they weren't too expensive,"I bought these a couple weeks ago since my beloved Dr. Brown's washable pads are no longer offered. These seemed like they might be similar in size, comfort, and affordability. No so much. These pads are only about 4 inches in diameter, so the edges are pretty obvious unless I wear a padded-style bra (I'm about a 34C). They stick, which can make them a bit uncomfortable when removing them to feed the baby or pump. After the first wash, the flannel on the inside pilled-up, and the pads puffed-up, making them even more obvious in my bra. Since I don't leak much, I can't give much info on how absorbent they are. Suffice it to say that I'm glad that I didn't pay a lot...I suppose you get what you pay for (though I don't recall paying much more than about $8 for Dr. Browns)."
2,not that great,"I used these pads for a few months. I have barely any leakage, and they contain minimal amount of breast milk well. I wouldn't recommend for moderate or heavy milk flow though. The major problem with these is no curvature. They are flat and get dislodged constantly exposing the nipples. I leaked few times on cloths on the street as well at nighttime frequently. Lace on the back doesn't do anything to hold them in place. They are also visible under clothing. After several months of use the surface became rough, so they are becoming very uncomfortable. I wouldn't recommend these."
2,Not worth it,Would be helpful for slight leaking but anything substantial ran over. Also the pads are visible even under a padded bra. Get something that contours to your breast instead.
2,Not contoured and they stick to you...,"I bought these because I hate using disposables and adding to the waste problem. I'm sure there are better washable pads out there. These are completely flat and don't bend much to contour to your breast or nipple. They are super obvious under a thin bra or tank top. Plus, they stick to you--not horribly but still undesirable. I like the bag that comes with them but overall, I wouldn't buy this product again or recommend it."
2,Not Very Absorbant,"I bought two packs of these in the hopes that they would work well and I would be helping the environment by avoiding the disposable pads. Like other consumers discovered, they do not hold up at night for me. Also, when my son is nursing on one side, I find that the pad on the other side quickly becomes soaked through and my shirt is soaked soon afterward. Because they aren't very absorbant, I go through them quickly (I wash the set once every other day!), even with 12."
4,Great for the price,"I love the look and feel of these. Very soft against the skin. They have great absorbency. (Note, I've not worn them overnight) I do have a hard time getting them to stay put in my sports bra. They would probably be ok in a regular bra though."
2,Didn't quite meet my expectations,"I would have one let down and the pad would be soaked through PLUS my clothing. And sometimes just a part of the pad would be wet but still leak all over my clothes! I am not impressed but having washable is nice... Avent's disposable pads are AMAZING however. I'll have several let downs and not a drop will get anywhere but on the nursing pad. So if your let downs only produce a drop or two, I'd definitely get these washable ones...but keep the lanolin close by cause if you don't put some on you'll stick to the pad and pulling it off after you've had let down and it's dried is pretty painful. But those disposable ones don't have any problems like that. GET THE DISPOSABLE ONES!! :)"
3,They do the job,These nursing pads do the job but they are just okay. They are visible through my shirt/bra because the edges are thicker. I decided to use them for night time but they are a little small for my big boobs.
2,Not a happy mom,I received these pads as a gift and they do not work. I am thrilled with all of the other Avent products but these pads are horrible! I am considered a light flow and these pads DO NOT provide any type of absorbency! I would not recommend the washable pads to anyone. The disposable ones will provide much better protection than these will.
3,A little too bulky under many shirts.,These pads are quite absorbant but they are also somewhat too bulky. I use these thicker ones when I want to be sure that I do not leak. I have never leaked with them. The do stick to your nipples a bit but I don't find it to be too much of a problem.
1,Avent Washable Nursing Pads Suck.,"I bought a 6pk. of Avent washable nursing pads because I have been going through a ton of disposables and it was getting expensive. Well, I put them on while I was still out and ended up with big wet circles on my shirt. When I took them out, they were completely DRY and my bra was soaked. I kid you not, they repel breast milk. Not to mention you could also see them through my shirt. Do not buy these."
2,These have changed!,"I purchased 2 packs of these pads with my first child 4 years ago. I really liked them and with my second, I needed one more pack due to a few being lost in the years in between. They still come in a great washable mesh bag, but the new pads are smaller and using very different materials than my first sets. I do not like this new style,OLD Version:4.5"" diameterPoly lace exteriorJersey knit interior (only negative- it feels wet quickly)Overall very absorbentMolds to breast shape to create a concave pad interiorNEW Version:~4"" diameterPoly lace exteriorFlannel interior (positive- it doesn't feel wet)Thin and not very absorbentStays in a flat shape and doesn't mold to breast shapeThe only plus with this last set is the flannel interior. Overall I do not like the smaller size and don't think these are nearly as absorbent as the older sets that I have. I will keep these as my emergency pads while my older sets will remain my everyday choice."
3,I will try something else next time,"These do a decent job absorbing, but my daughter was 3 months old when I bought these, so I haven't tested them during the worst leakage time (first month for me). They're not contoured at all, so they don't stay put as well and aren't very big so they can move out of the critical position a little too easily (even for me, and I'm not very busty). Also, not being contoured, you have to wear pads over them for shape if you're going to wear a fitted shirt. They do they job, but I'm going to keep looking for something better."
1,Absolutely no absorbency!!,Ignored the bad reviews having loved all avent products so far. But these washable pads are the worst! I thought i could use them for light leakage instead of the disposable ones but They dont even absorb light leakage!! The disposables are muchhh better.
2,not strong enough for big leakers,"If you leak a lot or have oversupply (before solids, especially if you're pumping also), these pads aren't good enough. I leaked right through them several times before I just decided to purchase some disposables with plastic backing. When my milk leaking slows down a little, I will start using them again."
1,A waste!,"These almost seem to repel, rather than absorb liquid. I end up with milk all along the bottom of my bra and the pads feel totally dry. These are useless!"
3,washable Nursing Pads,"These pads are O.K. When I have used them they have moved around some, and that kind of defeats the purpose of the pad, but they are a nice size and thickness and seem to do their job when they are where they need to be. the lace is supposed to help them stay in place, but I think it didn't work to well with my choice of bra."
1,Waste of Money--Buy Dr. Brown's instead!,I wish that I could give these pads less than 1 star! I bought them because they seemed like such a good deal. A friend had given me the Dr. Brown's washable nursing pads and I loved them and wanted to get more. The packages looked similar and you got two extra pads for less money than the Dr. Brown's. The catch--these pads were much too small! I wear medium-support style nursing bras with stretchy spandex cups so it matters what the pads look like underneath my bra and clothing. These pads made me look too weird so I could not wear them in public. I took back the unopened packages (don't know what to do with the opened one--burn them?) and spent the extra $ on a quality product. Just wanted to give a fair warning to you who are buying them on the internet. Happy nursing!
3,o.k. just O.K. breast pads,I received these pads as a gift from a friend. I was really excited as I liked the feel of the cloth better than the feel of my disposable pads. These pads work really well for me during the day when I can change them if I feel they are not keeping the wetness away. The negative is that at night I always wake up wet. In the beginning I thought maybe it was because my body wasn't used to my babies schedual and I was leaking excessivly but it has been almost 6 weeks and they just do NOT work at night!
2,poor product,"I bought this product after reading some positive reviews. I used the pads once - and I leaked though the pads, my bra, and through my shirt. I tend to only leak a little at night and the disposable pads seam to work much better.The pads also were itchy -I don't know if this will improve after I wash them. I am just too afraid to try again!I wanted to save money and the waste of pads, but a wet shirt just isn't worth it!"
1,Horrrrrrible,For years I've never written a review on here but these were such a waste I HAD to! They serve their purpose for about an hour! I am about a size D - DD and these were fine size wise but they don't absorb much at all! Don't waste your money !
2,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this product. I wanted to avoid using disposable pads and purchased these pads based on the positive reviews of this product. I was totally disappointed. The pads are thick. They are so thick that they are so indiscrete when wearing them under shirts that aren't totally baggy. They're not that absorbant either. I would wake up at night soaked and be fearful all day long that I was leaking through my shirt. After a few weeks, I gave up and switched to disposable pads and I am much happier."
1,Not Even Worth The Sale Price,"These pads are terrible. I used the Avent disposables which are the absolute best, so I thought their washables would be good as well. Well that was a big mistake. They curve outward instead of following the natural curve of the breast, making them visible under any type of shirt or sweater. I figured I could use them when I was home. Then I got tired of changing clothes from all the leaks I experienced. These pads don't absorb much at all. What I was saving on disposables, I was wasting on detergent and time."
2,THEY LEAK SOMETHING TERRIBLE,"These breast pads were next to the worst breast pads I tried. I would end up soaking wet after one let-down!! The disposable Avent breast pads were great, I just couldn't use these. The absolute worst breast pads I used were the ones by evenflo. The gel/crystals would come out of the side of the pads and end up everywhere - including all over my son's face. I don't know if that stuff was non-toxic or not, but I just wasn't comfortable with the possibility of my son ingesting all that absorbant gel... The Evenflo pads were definitely the worst."
2,they stick :-(,"after a little leakage, they stick.The type of pad with a lining is much better.the laundry bag is a nice feature."
3,Okay for daytime use,"I bought these pads because I was hoping to save money and because I like the brand Avent. I have no complaints about any of their other products, but these pads could've been made better. First of all, at night they do not stay in place. I've woken up many times and have had to change my bra and clothes because they were soaking wet. Second, when they do stay in place, they don't absorb much. I can use them in the daytime when I don't leak much, but at night when there's long stretches where my daughter doesn't eat, they become filled and leak. And lastly, they do stick to my nipples, so I have to be careful when I remove them. I do like the convience of them, though, and they came with their own little laundry bag so they don't get lost in the washer or dryer, very helpful. If your a heavy leaker, I would recommend getting a different brand."
4,Great Eco-Friendly option,"These are great you can just throw them in the wash, however if you leak heavily you might want to add a disposable behind them when you are out and about and can't change the pad because they are not leak proof always."
4,Nursing Pads,A must have when breast feeding. These are however a little on the thick side. You need to be wearing a heavier shirt or sweater/ sweat shirt to conceal pads in place. Comes with nice small nylon bag to wash them in.
2,They leak like crazy!,"I like the look of these, the lace on the outer layer is cute, but they don't hold moisture well at all. It's about as absorbent as a flannel burp cloth - if you leak more than a tiny bit, it'll go right through the pad. I used these at night occasionally because they're soft and they would keep the milk from running down my shirt, but my shirt would be damp after every feeding. They're also very thick, which makes them very noticeable under a shirt. If you want a great cloth nursing pad, get Bamboobies - they're way more absorbent, thinner, less noticeable, and cuter. Don't waste your money on these."
1,not worth it,"These pads don't do the job at all. They barely absorb any milk. I even washed them several times thinking that maybe it would soften up the fabric and increase their absorbency. Milk seems to run off the pad and into my nursing bra getting me wet and leaving the pad dry. I would be satisfied if there were any sign that the pad was actually soaking up any milk, but there's not. Don't waste your money."
1,horrible,"they are horrible! they are bulky and don't stay in place. they leaked right through my bra, shirts and my baby."
3,Leaky Pads,"While these nursing pads are thick, they tend to leak through vs the other flannel pads I have used in the past. I use these when my other ones are dirty & waiting on laundry day. I would not buy this specific kind again."
4,Best first set of washable nursing pads,"I wear these every day. They're thick and absorbent, and soft on my skin. I much prefer them over theNUK Reusable Nursing Pads, 6 Packwhich I bought at a local store to get me through until these came in. The NUK pads were too thin to be useful.If you care if they show and you wear form-fitting shirts these might show.Apparently I'm a ""heavy leaker."" At night these pads are too small to stay in place as I toss and turn, though they are the standard size (a little over 3 inches in diameter). I ended up making myself some 5-inch x 5-inch square nursing pads to use at night.Nursing Pads Ekstra Style, Smalllook like they might be large enough, and LANAcare also has larger sizes. I can't use wool though.I ended up buying 3 sets of these, so I can wear a clean set partway through the day if necessary, a clean set at night, and not end up doing the wash every single day."
2,decent,"The good...they're inexpensive and washable. They even come with their own bag to wash them in.The bad...These pads bunch up some when washed, are conspicuous when worn, move around in the bra and leak when worn overnight (I'm not sure if the milk is running past them or going through them). Also, if you put the pad back in your bra immediately after nursing without drying the nipple off or applying lanolin or something similar, the pad glues itself to the nipple which is very uncomfortable to peel off (you'll need to wet the pad to get it off comfortably)."
1,Not worth your money,"I bought several types of reusable nursing pads and these were, by far, the worst. They are not absorbent, not comfortable, move all over and just generally poorly made. The bag only held up for a couple washings. I've started just throwing them away."
1,Worst one's I've tried.,"I have three brands of washable breast pads and these are the worst by far. They don't leak from the center but from around the edges of the pad. Every other pad has worked great for me but these. Also they are really thick, so they show under your shirt more than other brands. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
1,Better Options Available,Wasn't impressed with the avent washable nursing pads for the following reasons:- material is non-absorbant- material is not as soft as other options available- pads stick to nipples- lace on the outside can be seen through bra/nursing tank- small circle creates a strange raised bump seen from outside
1,Worse product I've ever purchased.,"I'm normally not one to write reviews, but this product was AWFUL. It arrived today and I put them on immediately. Within one hour the front of my shirt was soaked beneath each breast. My baby is only 5 days old, so it's not like I'm producing large amounts of milk. The pads did not absorb anything. Even when I poured some milk on them to test them, the milk just ran off the pad. I will stick with the disposable by Lansinoh from now on--they can hold milk for hours without leaking--even overnight."
2,Medela pads are better,"I have a Bravado nursing bra, and the Avent pads are too thick and too small in diameter. They don't stay in place, they're bulky and they don't absorb as much as the Medela pads. I also don't like that they stick to my nipples, and that they have lace on one side so you can't flip them over if they get a little damp and you're not able to change them. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money to get the Medela reusables. I should also mention (as I wish that someone had told me as a new mom) that you tend to leak a ton at first, so the Lansinoh disposables are the way to go, then you can switch to reusables after a few weeks when you don't leak as much."
1,better off buying something else,"These reusable nursing pads aren't worth getting at all. They don't absorb quickly enough and they don't hold anything hardly at all. My baby is 3 months old, and so it's not like there is any type of engorgement (except morning), and they can't keep up with normal nursing. Honestly your better off stuffing a burp cloth down your shirt than using one of these. I think I'd rather use disposables, because at least they work."
1,don't buy it,very bad to usevery small nor cover the nipples at allnot comfortable it's too late i already used it and i don't theycan let me returned itdon't buy it
3,an ok product,Had to wash it several times to have it become soft. It was quite crisp when it was new. I find the size too small :(
1,No good for new moms,"I was tired of using disposables so I wanted to try these...I was so excited because they felt less 'plasticky' than the disposables and claimed to have a boundary to prevent leakage. I didn't mind that they weren't very discrete under my nursing bra/cami and that they shifted around a little. What made them useless was that they let milk get through my bra and shirt after less than a couple hours of use. They didn't actually seem to leak through to the other side, they seem to collect milk and then let it sink down to the rim of the pad where it leaks at the edge of the pad. So much leaked through!I did read some reviews that said reusables aren't good for early nursers...so I will try them again when my milk doesn't really flow as much. Still keeping my review as only 1 star since they leaked when they're not supposed to."
1,Do not absorb!!,"I bought these thinking they would do the job & save me money from the disposable pads. These are the second disposable pads I've bought & none of them seems to do the job, they leak thru instantly, your better off sticking to disposable pads! :("
2,Leaks through,It leaks through. I was nursing and milk came out of other breast onto shirt. They also fit funny inside bra. I have small breast and did not like these. I think it would be worse for someone with bigger breast since they leak
1,Switch a big problem,This switch is nothing but trouble....Tried everything and still the rolling stock derails when going through...Appears to be a problem with the frog as its rails do not sit flush with the immovable rails....Tried all the advice of model railroaders who have had the same problems and moved to another switch....As will I....Save your money....
3,Sorry Mr. Humes,"This is basically sensationalism. Everything that's scandalous about Whitney is exaggerated to the Nth degree, leaving the less eccentric voices unheard and in the dust. As a former Whitney student, I can say that not all Whitney parent are abominable Nazis who encourage their children to cheat in order to get ahead. My own mother told me she'd rather see me get an F than cheat. Yet Mr. Humes makes these broad generalizations that make the reader want to slap these parents upside the head. How can the reader expect to get the total picture when there are so many gaping holes in it?"
1,Disturbing,"I found the information in this book disturbing, about students who did nothing but study, who rationalized away craming for tests only to forget mere moments after. Do you know what the most disturbing part was? That the information in this book is not true. I go to this high school, and this book glosses over everything that truly makes the school what it is. The author does not understand the essence of this high school and presents a highly skewed and flawed viewpoint.I might even go as far as to call it a muckraking book, but one with none of a muckrakers helpfulness. This book is naught but a twisted pack of lies and no one should buy it"
2,Yuk,"This book was a chore to get through. There were some spots that were entertaining, but for the most part I found to be boring.And maybe because I went to a public school that was doing this kind of AP type stuff 30 years ago, and managed to do it without excluding anyone or needing entrance exams.. and still found time for those kids who maybe did not wish to go to college (and believe me, they did everything to try to talk you into going to college).. I was just not that impressed. Back then many of my teachers saw alot of this college prep stuff as a memorization game rather than true learning and said so. Anyone blessed with a good memory could play the system. This whole book to me had a pompous tone, and many of the students seem like little elites. But to be fair the author does point all this out, which is why two stars. If you really want to read this, please get it from the library so you can give it back."
3,Good value but large pill,"Salmon oil may do what it says but I have only been taking it a couple of weeks, so too soon to tell. But the pill is very large and I would prefer taking 2 pills half this size. Buying from Amazon makes it a good value."
1,Terrible Fish After-Taste,"I had been usingPure Alaska Omega-3 Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil 1000mg Softgels 180-Countand never ever had any after taste. I bought this product because of the lower price. After two days of taking this, I am ready to pitch them into the trash. They are causing me to burp with a terrible fishy after-taste. I would not re-order this if it were free. Too, these Softgels are much larger than the ""Pure Alaska"" product, even though both claim to be 1000 mg. If both do (you never know) contain the same amount, then the ""Pure Alaska"" is much easier to swallow."
3,Salmon oil tablets,"I bought this because the price was pretty good and salmon oil is a healthy fish oil to be taking. Personally, I have problems with belching fishy taste after taking a lot of different kinds of fish oil. Krill oil is not too bad but that stuff is pretty expensive.The quality of the tablets is fine. However, I really have a problem with these coming back on me after taking them. If you belch fish after taking fish oil tablets, then this could be a problem for you. Sometimes keeping the bottle in the freezer and then taking the tablets cold helps the belching problem. These tablets are a good price and reasonable dosage for the money."
5,Wild Alaskan Salmon oil.,This is a great way to get our omega 3. Fast easy transaction-I love Amazon shopping!I even buy a separate product from Amazon for my Cavalier King Charles Spaniels!
1,THE SMELL IS TERRIBLE!!!!,"NASTY SMELL AND GIVES YOU FISHY BREATH FOR HOURS!!!!Ingredients: Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil, Softgel capsule (gelatin, purified water), aqueous coating solution (ethylcellulose, medium chain triglycerides (coconut), oleic acid, sodium alginate, stearic acid), natural vitamin E, soy lecithin.People, please post the ingredients in the vitamins you buy on amazon since amazon obviously won't do this for us.Thanks!!"
3,SWEET!!!,"This baby has a built in FM tuner/recorder that really comes in handy. My old RCA Jukebox only lasted for a few months. and the sound was horrible. I tried other MP3 solutions but only recently did I find this little Gem. It's battery holds much more power than the lyra and I havnt had any problems so far. The Lyra was cheap, but HUGE!!! (20 GB) I like the Juke Jams small size, it fits almost anywhere, and the user interface is great. I still havn't tested ALL of it's functions out. this'll make a great Holiday gift."
2,"Cheap, but not worth the money.","I have had many problems with this machine. It crashes all the time, it looses entire albums, and the battery is very unreliable. I have had to reload my entire music collection three times in 6 months, and it is long process to do it each time because it no requires you to use their very poorly designed program. It is an inexpessive devise, but I recommend spending a bit more for a better item. It will be worth the $$."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought a this and about a month later it just stopped working. I emailed digital media group and they sent me a Return authorization number which i put in an envelope as it said to do and repackaged the mp3 player and sent it back. 3 months later, i still hadn't gotten a replacement so i called them. They said that they had never gotten it but would send me a new one. The one they sent me wasn't a polaroid, but a generic brand one like it. The accesories were also generic name brand and pieces of junk. 2 months later it stoped working again and by then digital media group didn't exist any more. The headphones also broke and were very low quality to begin with. I learned my lesson about not buying name brand products nad just recently bought a video iPod which is much better!"
4,Warning about Multiple editions.,"From 1977 onwards, the stories ""Prima Belladonna"" and ""Studio 5, the stars"" were replaced by ""The Overloaded Man"" and ""Thirteen to Centaurus""."
2,Laney's opinion,"My gradkids, four years old, are really interested in the band thing, which is why I purchased the dvd. I was mildly disappointed because it focused less on the band and more on the star ( Dave) and his silly antics. I believe, however, that this is the only video of its kind that it available."
5,Just fine for a niche product,I bought this to couple two Canon lenses face to face for some macro experimentation. It is nothing more than a (glassless) filter ring with threads on both sidaes (58mm filter size). It does what I wanted and I got some interesting shots.
5,great product!,"fast shipping, and cheaper cost then some others with out cheaper quality! great product!Definitely recomend if you need for attaching two lens or a macro lens."
4,the game of silence,The pages were very clean. I was a little disappointed there were several stickers that didn't easily come off on the front cover.
5,A way of life,"Omakakeyens. A young girl's name. A name that is a signpost that you are entering a way of life far from your own. Her days are filled with her family, their way of life within the pattern of the seasons, a relationship to all living and growing things around them.This is the 2nd of what is now 3 books. First, Birchbark House where we first read of Omakakeyens, I think about 6 or 7 years old, and her Ojibwa family at the turn of the century. This book follows as she grows up in northern Minnesota, with the just released Porcupine Years as the story continues. They are filled with love and humor; you can put them down but you don't want to. I have all three to give my granddaughter, but not until I've read them.Louise Erdrich gives sentences, paragraphs, that take my breath away. Her books are true treasures, deserving of all the awards they have received."
4,Box 1MM-22 Nickel Free Italian Sterling Silver Sturdy Box Link,I like this chain very much. I am going to keep it even though my husband bought me a much more expensive chain for Christmas. This will be a great one when I want to wear a bit longer necklace. The price was right and it is great to have an extra!
1,Defects in this Kindle edition,"This Kindle edition of Nostromo has many instances of a phrase misplaced in the text, requiring the reader to unscramble a sentence or two. While this is generally possible to figure out, it interrupts the flow of ones reading. Since there are many Kindle editions of this title, I suggest that you purchase a different one than this:Nostromo, A Tale Of The Seaboard +"
1,couldn't even finish it,"I do realize novels were written in a different style at the time Conrad wrote Nostromo, but after struggling for a couple months through the first 100 pages of what is essentially background material, I just decided it wasn't worth it. I had yet to get to the actual plot of the book by this time and decided there were too many great books out there to waste more time on this. I had really enjoyed The Secret Agent and Heart of Darkness wasn't bad so I was very disappointed in Nostromo. The premise of the book sounds so interesting.Good luck to those of you starting this book. I hope the struggle will be worth it to you."
4,A great story about a revolution caused by some silver mines,"This took place in a small South American state. It all atarted when some people threatened to attack some silver mines, and take all the silver. Nostromo was the people's man. He was to hide all the silver so that nobody could still it."
2,Much to do about a place you never heard of,"Look, I'm a patient reader. I make a commitment to a story, but this is the most unfocused, pretentious story I have ever read. Sure, Conrad is great on description---but the problem is, he describes EVERYTHING from a pen to a cloud to people with equal attention and importance. That's good, you might think. No it's not because as the reader you don't know what's important to the story, because even trivial things are described for pages and pages. I think the author wrote this story more for himself than an intended audience. It's an old man's last sentimental extrapolation. Oh, and the main protagonist, Nostromo---he's missing in action. He's just a glimmer that pops in an out throughout the story. If you're in prison and you got nothing else to do, this might be the ticket for you. Other than that, I challenge you sit through this."
1,The Book which tells you why your instincts for Baseball are true,"This is a page turner. The stats that are introduced tend to support the hueristic beliefs that a true baseball fan already has. As a Phillies fan and a former fantasy league member who drafted teams based on what is now known as a Sabermetrics, I was pleased to see how my former beliefs (I had some good teams in the 80s and 90s before I quit) could be validated by recent research.Folks,I love this book."
5,Excellent Introductory Work,"I had the privilege of not only using this book as a textbook for a comparitive politics class, but listening to the author who was the professor expand on the concepts in the book.This text is an excellent text for student to learn the concepts and methods of comparitive politics. It is written in an easily readable style that makes the material much easier to digest. The country studies range from the well known Western European Democracies to the less developed countries and emerging democracies in Africa and Latin America.All in all an excellent textbook which makes what could be a dull and grating subject interesting and contemporary."
3,"In answer to ""what scale is this"" .. my guess is HO scale.","N scale comes in 5 and 10 inch (and fractions of 5 inch) straight sections. HO scale has a standard 9 inch straight. I do wish Amazon would specify the scale because I see a fair amount of HO scale track when I search for ""Bachmann N scale track"""
3,"UH, NO AROMA","I have only had the unit for a few days and already have a problem with the ""aroma"" part of it. The pads that came with the unit barely had any scent. Fortunately, I had purchased a couple additional boxes of the menthol/eucalyptus, and they work great. I'll add oils to the others (NOT THEIRS lol) and place them near the litter boxes so I can get some use out of them...."
5,The vapor-eze works great,"Hi I just saw the post about fires and called the company. I spoke with Steve Powers the owner. The current owner bought it in 2006 and completely rebuilt the vaporizer. Added 3 new safety features, TCL switch, ceramic casings, all kinds of technical stuffs. He has never had any problems with fire or hazardous malfunctions since the rebuild of the product. He said he has had 3 returns for various reasons since 2006. Thats a pretty darn good track record. He was very helpful and had alot of information for me. Nice to see someone who is proud of his product and stands behind it 100%. I bought this product for my 18month old for congestion and been using the eucalyptus pads and they have worked great! I am very impressed with the product. This is a great American product and I am happy to support a home-grown business."
5,Kept Interest,It had some twists that I wasn't expecting. Safe book for all ages - don't have to worry about any trash. Glad I made the purchase.
3,Los solitarios hits,"This cd completes my collection of Solitarios. This 70's Mexican, romantic pop band has many memorable hits to offer. This particular album has a few older songs mixed in with some of their later stuff from the 80's and 90's. I like their earlier material so I tend to skip some songs here and there-this album is a must, however, if you are planning to replace your vinyl LP's for cd's. The sound quality is very good. Pensar and the Creedence Clearwater Revival cover are my favorites."
2,So-so collection,"This collection features the hits ""A Rockin' Good Way (To Mess Around And Fall In Love)"" by Dinah Washington, ""Handy Man"" by Jimmy Jones, ""Harbor Lights"" by The Platters,""(You're My) Soul And Inspiration"" by The Righteous Brothers, ""Sunny"" by Bobby Hebb, ""It's A Man's Man's Man's World"" by James Brown, ""Only The Strong Survive"" by Jerry Butler, ""Hey Leroy, Your Mama's Callin' You"" by The Jimmy Castor Bunch, ""Ta Ta"" by Clyde McPhatter, and ""My True Confession"" by Brook Benton.Whether or not you will enjoy this collection of 1960s soul music is based on your opinions of these songs, but the only songs that really stood out to me were ""It's A Man's Man's Man's World"" by James Brown and the awesome song, ""Sunny"" by Bobby Hebb."
3,geek man!,"with unforgettable lines like""slap me around and call me susan"",this movie is a gem!a batman obsessed geek decides to be a crime fighter when his grandma is gunned down.so,utilizing junk people send him and his grannies sheets for a cape,this would-be super hero goes out on the prowl.are clever gadgets enough to save a vengeful geek from the heinous michael minelli?can he juggle his geekdom and a relationship?can he......just watch it!"
5,Anyone Can Be A Hero...,"I loved this movie! I thought that it was a great send up of the ""superhero"" movie... Damon Wayens plays a nerd that gets tired of all the crime that happens in the neighborhood. After the sensless murder of his Grandmother, Damon's charactor takes a stand agienst crime... I think that the movie was funny. Sure the guy was childlike, but his heart was in the right place... This is a must have for those that are into the ""superhero"" type films..."
3,Damon does a great job of showing his acting diversity!,"I think this was a good movie that was easy to watch and made you feel you could ""root for the idiot"". The supporting cast did an equally good job. Not everyone can pull off this type of roll as well as Damon did. I would love a chance to play a part like this. Sure everyone wants to be the ""Action Star"", even though this isn't your typical action part it satisfied my entertainment thirst. It doesn't need to be a 10 million dollar movie to entertain."
5,Important source of Fenian stories,"This is a translation of important sources on the Fenians from the 12th Century. It adopts a format of dialog and story telling between the survivors of the Fenians and St. Patrick.I found the translation a bit plodding but translating Middle Irish into Modern English is a very difficult task and therefore I have chosen not to deduct stars for that. I do not believe that it is possible to retain a lexically correct translation which also preserves the mood of the original due in part to syntactic differences between the languages.At the same time, this is a great collection of stories which can be mined deeply for insights into Celtic social order, ideology, culture, etc. It's an incredibly important work and the translation is adequate for most purposes.I'd highly recommend it."
2,interesting but strange,a little slow-paced and I can't stand the dialogue the author used. was a little depressing but I wanted to know how it all ended. the characterizations were like nothing I've ever come across before. if you like old fashioned novels you might like this one. just was not my cup of tea I guess.
2,Slow and tedious,I found this book to be rather painful to read. It dragged on and was so dismal a setting and plot that I felt rather discouraged about life at the end of it. I realize that life isn't all roses but there was very little in to uplift one at all.
4,More great Corben adventure,"Den (nee Daniel Ellis Norman)conducts his regular business on this magical world: assaulting wizardly castles, defeating un-human guardians, you know, the usual. Then, somehow, he is betrayed, apparently by the woman he loves, and falls into drunkenness and flabby disgrace. Then he gets better, and does some more defeating.OK, the story is a bit choppy. Fine. I'm just here for Corben's classic comic artwork, so familiar to long-time readers of Heavy Metal and many other venues for illustrated fiction. The art is a good as ever, with Corben's sleek and (often) mighty figures, blobby clouds, and shambling bad guys. I just don't see any better comic artwork out there - lots that different, sometimes very different, and also good, just nothing I'd say is unambiguously better.//wiredweird(PS: The paperback ISBN is 096238416X, a number that Amazon has assigned to the hardcover version of this book.)"
3,Perhaps for teenagers,"Perhaps these soppy love stories can entertain teenagers for a while, but I watched this series because I was a fan of Alias and I was sorely disappointed. Don't expect anything like action or good acting in this series."
2,Disappointment,"I bought this series because I love all of the actors from more recent series'. I was sadly disappointed. The acting was truly terrible. The only good thing I could glean from watching this series is that I was able to see how all of these actors evolved to become the great actors they are today. Jennifer Garner has grown to become an incredible actress. Michael Weatherly has improved significantly, although I still wouldn't consider him a great actor. Eion Bailey has improved too. If you really want it, buy it for ""historical"" reasons. Otherwise, don't buy it at all."
3,Disappointed in The Christmas Companion,"I was disappointed that this CD contained mostly music instead of stories. The reviews I read before I purchased this led me to believe the opposite. And, the stories weren't very memorable or funny. I usually enjoy Garrison Keillor so I really wish I didn't have to give this CD a negative review.Some of the music, however, was very good bluesy Christmas music that my husband liked so much he wants to put it on his Ipod."
1,Get a different RubberMaid product,"This thing is a hunk of junk; a million little pieces that don't line up properly. Just a complete frustration. Save your money and get a kit from the HomeFree Rubbermaid line. Much, much, much better!"
1,BEWARE,"This is a rip off--the video footage is poor quality, and simply picked up off the internet. The Bio likely took about five minutes to throw together. The discography is incomplete as well as inaccurate. TOTAL waste of money--DO NOT BUY THIS!"
1,Not worth 1 red cent,"DO NOT BUY . The only good picture is the cover . On a scale of 1-10 , 10 being the best picture quality is a 4-5 . Ronnie is holding different cds up , you cant tell what cd it is picture quality is so bad . Amazon should not sell this trash & should offer a full refund ."
1,Brutally honest interview thats all this is,Dont buy if your looking for new insite or if you already have the bootlegged version of the brutally honest bus interview Dio did back in the angry machine days its no better then the boot and a rip off DONT BUY
1,I wish I could give it zero stars,"This is the biggest disappointment and waste of money ever! Poor video quality, biography is a joke, its a huge scam. Do not buy this dvd."
4,Dio Forever !!!,"Having grown up with ""DIO"" as a teenager in the 80's, this purchase has been the best trip down memory RJD! There will never be another group as DIO. The variety of Ronnies songs was incredible. This is a must-buy!"
3,new mom too,"I totaly agree with you, there is not a description of any size posted regarding this item, so when i got it i was so mad that it does not fit the regular crib and now i have to pay for the shipping it back . i was so disappoited too."
3,not quite as pictured,"Just got my wings, they are cute, but the colors are definitely not as vibrant as what is pictured. They are a stretchy nylon (like nylon stockings) over a wire frame with felt trim. They are pictured as red, purple and pink. The ones I got are red with what I would describe as smoke colored detail, they do have glitter accents. So, I am keeping them, but be aware that the picture is not really accurate."
4,All day with Adrien Peterson,"My son is a big fan of Adrien Peterson, so we all enjoyed watching this DVD. I thought it would be a little longer, but I didn't check the length before purchasing it. We still liked it."
1,never worked,"The cartridges were covered with ink when I opened them, they never worked in my printer. I ended up buying a new printer for just a little more than it cost to replace both ink cartridges."
2,him,"same music different cd cover as usual..love HIM, sick of the same songs..so I just stopped listening or buying them all together"
4,Love Metal-HIM,"HIM is the best band in this time, and this CD is the last one and the better I think about the Gothic Rock. I really recommend this product for all the rock fans and buy it at amazon, they have great discounts in the productos they offer and the delivery time is just Great."
5,!!it great!,this cd has absoulutly wonderful lyrics that match their tunes just perfectly.i love it..
5,Pure magic,"I don't know about everyone, but I listen to music because I like it, not because some guy on TV listens to them. So to the people who accuse HIM fans of doing just that, I suggest looking at you're own life and changing a few things.Anyway, this cd is amazing, as with all of their cds. I must say, I enjoyed Razorblade Romance more, but this cd is a must have for any fan, new or old. And to truly appreciate HIM, you must see them live. I know they haven't toured the US very much, but just go to their website (www.heartagram.com) and watch for when they're coming to town. It is more than worth it."
4,Very Good,"I am new to HIM and so far have ""Love Metal"",Deep Shadows and brillant highlights"", and ""Dark Light.They are a great band,and so far I like all of their songs. Now,I'm wondering;can anyone tell me why groups like "" End of Green"" The Last Dance, My Dad is Dead, Dreadful Shadows,(I think they disbanded unfortunetely),Ikon and Xymox never seem to make it in the US.MDID and Last Dance are from the US.I was just wondering;could it be that not everyone can listen to jazz,dance music,heavy metal,christian rock,Country music,and even classical and semi classical (like myself-not everyone can listen to 8 or 9 different kinds of music,but hopefullymost people can listen to more than one kind of music. Anyway,for anyone interested;look up the above mentioned groups on google(they are all rock/mild metal(MDID has free downloads).Now,back to HIM;they are a great band and have really great melodies,and I intend to get their other albums,definitely,their next one. <livinon@hotmail.com>"
5,one of my favorites,"I recently saw HIM live and fell in love. Soon after, I bought all the CD's that I didn't have including this one and it is now one of my favorites. I love all of HIM's CD's but this one is one of the best if not my favorite. It is HIM at their best and is a good choice if you are looking to discover this band or just want to buy one of their CD's and not the whole collection. The best songs are ""Buried Alive By Love"" and ""The Sacrament."" If you enjoy this CD and are looking to get some more HIM I suggest ""Razorblade Romance"" or ""Dark Light."""
2,THIS IS THE 7TH STAR!!!!!,One of the greatest albums ever made! It makes you see the love of your life crying as she kisses you...
2,His Intersperced Mediocity,"This is not HIM's best album. It does live up to it's name because is more metal-y, but the guitars are louder, and the tunes just aren't as catchy. I would recomend ""Dark Light"" much more."
4,Great CD,"""For You"" was one of the 2 great songs on here. The rest I cant conect with. Oh yes, and this ""Bam"" guy sucks. Always has. A promotion of MTv to make money...its all fake, and all stupid. CKY sucks and I refuse to attend anything they appear at. Get bent, you retarded Bam supporter asshats."
1,HIM is not good music,"Bam is a great skater, but his taste in bands is truly horrendous. There is nothing remotely enjoyable about this Finnish goth metal band."
1,oh god no,"With all the amazing music coming out of Finland, this is the one band that gets recognition? Black Hair Dye and a wardrobe from Hot Topic does not a good band make. This is generic, boring pseudo-metal which sounds more like a second-rate Motley Crue if Vince was an anorexic pansy. Everything about this band is uninspired and contrived."
3,"Their best album - 3,5 stars","THisis their best album. Occasionally i dont like this kind of music. I prefer more original gothic or atmospheric music by Paradise lost - Anathema..... Him play this pseudo-gothic poser and in some moments sissy music. In this album they play good music. Not amazing so i can love them, but really good music. Personally i liked very very much the track Circle of fear (I think it is their best track till this day from what i have heard. THen i like the tracks : The Sacrament + buried alive by love. I find the other tracks a little too much <<love songs>> for my taste. Anyway it is not a bad album."
4,Love Metal,"1. ""Buried Alive By Love"" - Love the music here.2. ""The Funeral of Hearts"" - LOVE IT. HANDS DOWN, ONE OF MY FAVORITES!!!3. ""Beyond Redemption"" - Good song.4. ""Sweet Pandemonium"" - I like it, but not over tracks 2 and 6.5. ""Soul on Fire"" - Love when he says ""Soul On Fire"" in the song. Musically good.6. ""The Sacrament"" - LOVE IT. HANDS DOWN, ONE OF MY FAVORITES!!!7. ""This Fortress of Tears"" - Like it a lot. Growing on me each time I listen to it.8. ""Circle of Fear"" - Good song.9. ""Endless Dark"" - Good song.10. ""The Path"" - Musically/vocally awesome when it's at the chorus.11. ""Love's Requiem"" * - I LOVE IT from 6:00 on musically & vocally. a VERY LONG song though."
4,Russian Makarov,I purchased the Fobus paddle holster for a Russian made Makarov Baikal IJ-70 with adjustable rear sight. I have found other paddle holsters that were practically impossible to remove from your waistband. This holster is placed on and removed from the waistband with relative ease. The pistol is held very securely but comes out smoothly with a quick draw. The holster works well for conceal under a coat but should not be used for slow draw situations.
5,Fit great on my 3-year-old,"We live in the SF Bay Area, so only need light gloves a few weeks a year (if that). Our three year old boy is average size and has the usual, adorably chubby hands of his kind. These gloves fit well, not too loose or tight, and he was happy to wear them."
2,too small for 6 year olds,"These are for younger kids, not 6 year olds. My daughter just turned 6 and they don't fit her (and she does not have big hands)"
2,Poor value for price,If you were to buy these gloves in the store they would be a dollar for a pair. They are small for what the size claimed them to be and very thin when put on. My 5 year old's hands are nearly too big. Paper thin is the key. There is no magic about these magic stretch gloves.
2,Product not as promised,"I searched the internet for WHITE gloves. I found them on this site. When they were delivered, they were cream, definitely not white. I can't use them for the intended purpose. The product is fine but if you are looking for a specific color...beware. I would not have ordered these if they were correctly advertised."
3,"More like 3.5' than 36""","From what I can gather these are built to accommodate the meter not yard. They measure 37"" inside and 40.5"" outside (at the widest points) So don't plan to get more than one in anything smaller than an 8' grow tent/aria and don't expect to fit well in stands made for other brand tables.Construction seems durable and of good quality, they are not however 7"" deep as advertised by many distributors, its more like 5"" from the high point of the bottom (where the pots would rest) to the lower lip of the top (where a lid would rest) More like 6.5"" from the deepest point to the highest one (inside anyway). Barely deep enough to accommodate a 6"" net pot (no room to suspend them from a simple plywood or lexan lid)Just plan on them being more like like 3 1/2 foot wide and 5 inches deep."
3,Just average,"Pros:- I really like the ""feel"" of these knives; the handles are comfortable.- Non-serrated blades are nice.Cons:- Obviously fixable, but they're not terribly sharp.- I've already seen a couple small rust spots developing (had them less than 2 months) even though I always hand-wash them."
3,Average,"Picture Snatcher and Mayor of Hell are the weak links of this set. LadyKiller is the best film on this set. Cagney spoofs himself and great to see Mae Clark in here who Cagney made famous by shoving a grapefruit in her face. Cagney and Clark are great here. Smart Money was another reason to buy this set to see Robinson paired with Cagney for the only time. It's Robinson's show and Cagney is underutilized. It's still a treat to see two of the greatest gangsters and actors on film together. Brother Orchid is an average film. Edward G. Robinson's performance saves the film. Bogart's part is small but he does a good job. Look for these two in Bullets or Ballots I think that was a better film and Bogart had more screen time. Black Legion was an interesting film and a strong performance by Bogart. To most people it's probably just a B film but I liked it a lot. Ladykiller,Smart Money and Black Legion are the reason to buy this set."
4,Great gritty Warner classics with a moral,These Warner movies from the early 1930's were great entertainment while reflecting the social issues of the time. If you want to get an idea of life during the depression get this collection!
4,The Best Vol. III,"In the 1930's Warner Brothers made the best gangster movies ever. With James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, and Edward G. Robinson this studio had a lock on this genre. The movies in this set are not the best gangster movies. However, they are very enjoyable and I recommend this set wholeheartly."
2,Slow From The Start,Blood Secret by Kathryn Lasky is a book that starts out slow from the beginning. Since I am not very much into Histroical Fictions or Biographys this book was very tiresom to read. You follow the main character Jerry as she finds a mysterious trunk that holds many different stories of her ancestors. Sense the book often changes form Jerry to her ancestors point of veiw it is very hard to follow. Overall I would not recomend this book to someone who is looking for a quick start to lots of action.
3,Truth of the Secrets,"Blood Seceret was a thriling story. It Gripped and pulled me in to the book. I loved the way the book not only entertains it makes you think. I didn't know a lot about the Spanish inquisition: but this book descibes the pain, suffering and fear that all the Jews felt! I felt really connected to the characters through out the story. I felt their joys and pains as they battled the obstacles in their lives. I felt the book could get confusing at times, I didn't know who or what they would be talking about. I didn't like the ending; I felt it didn't tye things together well. It just left he reader hanging. But over all I really enjoyed the book and I highly recommend it to everyone.-Mid-Prairie kid"
2,What the hell!!!!!,This product would be fine IF THE HEAD CAME ON IT ALREADY! Yes i know you are supposed to put it in but it should be able to FIT! The part of the head that connects it to the body broke of as we tried to put it on. All and all very disappointed with this buy. Not worth the $38 we paid
1,Don't buy these toys!,"I bought this for my 12 year old daughter for Christmas and the toy has to have it's head put on!It wont fit! It broke. There was no way it would go in the socket.The company can't even provide assembly instructions with it. You have to go on line to get them, and guess what?The page is missing!If your a collector, don't open the packages.They should still function as toys. Very poor engineering."
1,Dissapointed,The toy took awhile to get to us then it was not packed in the package properly my son opened it and it's head was broken off I wrote to the company it took 3 - 4 days for a responce and they said to send it back my son had waited and was so excited I drilled the hole out and fixed it the best I could. He did not want to wait a week more for the new one to come with no promise the next one would be better very dissapointed......
4,PLEASENTLY SURPRISED,"I AM NOT BIG ON MOVIES ABOUT MUSIC OR SUCH, BUT THIS MOVIE WAS LOADED WITH LOTS OF FAMILIAR SONGS AND HAD A GOOD STORY LINE."
3,"Great for display, not as good for playing","For someone who has used Cat equipment, this would make a great gift model. It seems to be a very accurate model, and the die-cast construction gives it a nice weight and presence. However, it is not a great toy; the attachments (dozer blade and ripper) have realistic, but limited motion, and the tracks frequently come off the drive and idler wheels. Kids may become easily frustrated with the model and turn to more toy-like ones, but adults will like the details."
5,93! OLE'UNLCE AL CANT GO WRONG READING THIS.,"93!ALL THINGS THELEMIC OR OCCULT ESOTERIC WHAT EVER YOU MAY CALL IT THIS GIVES ALOT OF INFO INTO THE HEART OF THINGS MAGICKAL. 1THING UNCLE AL CAN CAUSE ALOT OF ADEPTS TO GO ASTRAY , HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS WERE AN ARE FAR VASTER THAN U CAN IMAGINE ALTHOUGH QWE AL HAVE THIS DIVINE SPARK .UNLES YOU IGNITE ITA D SEND THE SEPENT KUNDALINI UP TO THE AJNA WITH BOTH PINGALA AND IDA . YOU ARE WASTING TIME , A ARMCHAIR MAGICIAN. 93 !"
2,very few information,"i bought this book for the reason it was intended for: as an additional, quick guide for working with photoshop. well, the idea is good, but the book doesnt help you a lot when you are searching for something that you don't understand. this is because the books shows too many pictures (which are obviously what you see anyway when you get confused) and is very sparse with text information.the pictures quality is very good, but that doesnt help a lot to make the book better.I would recommend this book to a specific type uf user: somebody who never tried photoshop before and is playing around with the demo version to discover some of hte main functions. for pro users, don't waste your money."
4,Great Love Story,"Last Kiss Memories Last Forever....Great read. Well thought out story, characters, also their relationships to one another. I enjoyed learning about Sharon Wells, also her family and friends. I feel the author did a great job creating an interesting fictional love story, being inspired by the old song, Last Kiss. If you are a ""Beatles"" fan you might be interested how the character Paula Carr was given her name. I encourage you to get this book and find out for your self the unexpected twist this story provides.I personally enjoy the end. Sometimes, the end of the story as a whole is forgotten, you get to the end of the plot and that is where the story ends, or the end is dragged out. In this book the story as a whole is ended, and does not drag out. The book is great just get it and see for yourself!"
4,A Timeless Love Story,I really enjoyed reading Last Kiss. I love books that are different from the norm and this one is. The book is based on the song Last Kiss and the authors interpretation of how it was inspired. It is a fabulous love story that has you rooting for the good guys. I loved that it was clean and something I could pass along to my daughter to read. Last Kiss would make a great Book Club choice. Easy and fun to read!
1,Don't Bother,I have owned these knives for about a year and a half and they are the worst. I always wash by havd and they still rust and they are very dull. I even bought an electric sharpener and they just don't stay sharp. These are definately not worth the money buy another brand.
2,Lacking substance,"The title claims the book is a ""how to"". While full of interesting little stories, it lacks much practical advise. Perhaps the best advice is ""make sure you have the peronality and fortitude to deal with tenants."
2,Not for beginners,"This book is good, but the book's content doesn't match the title. This book wasn't written for people who have never owned any piece of property. The book tells you a couple of nice loopholes and hidden fees most first time landlords will get hit hit with out the blue, but that is it! They have whole sections about owning 30 and 40 resident apartment buildings which is something 9 out of 10 people that read this book will not be doing for years. A lot of the advice that they give such as get a lawyer and someone to look at the property before you buy it is common sense. This book also doesn't go into great detail about taxes and how to set the correct rent level like I thought it would. This book is good for a general overview, but that is about it."
2,Don't Buy Unless You're a Broker,"If you're a big-time broker, this book is for you!For the rest of us, I just cannot believe how many texts are out here that speak to such a small segment.Most people who need advice are those of us with only a handful of properties. We need help getting tenants, getting rid of bad tenants, and finding the best properties and locations."
5,The most useful book I've found,"When I decided to invest in real estate the first thing I did was research what source material I would start with. Through looking at reviews and finally through going to the bookstore and looking at all the books I'd found through research the Weiss book looked to be the best, and when I took it home and went through it in depth it proved to be a very complete, very useful book that has helped facilitate my real estate business.The book's strength is in its specific, concrete examples and advice: you can read this book and from there move on to specific steps that will lead to well-informed business decisions. Rather than getting too specific or being too general, it provides an broad outline (everything from starting a partnership to selecting property and management) that gives you enough information to start with, and direction on where to go for more.An excellent book: I look forward to buying his book on flipping properties when it comes out."
3,A Must Have for Arena Football Fans,"I am a huge fan of the Arena Football League 2. I think it is one of the best professional sports leagues in the US. It brings the excitement of big time football to smaller and now, larger markets at a low cost to fans and owners.This book reviews the inaugural season of the exciting Arena Football League 2. Highlights of the season include the perfect season by the Quad City Steamwheelers and the high scoring games of the Arkansas Twisters.The book also has really in-depth stats of the players, cities and the arenas themselves. Many of the players in this league from the 2000 season went on to play in the AF1.The book lacks excitement in that it is pretty much stats and info about the teams. There are very few pictures or ""fun"" articles.Overall, this should be a collector's item, since it is about the 1st season of AF2 which is now going into its 4th season."
5,The Best,I have read numerous books on the Russian revolution. Of them all this is undoubtedly one of the best.
3,Cute but not very functional,I got this and the matching canvas crates. I love the canvas crates! But the shelves in this organizer aren't very big. I can fit a couple blankets in each shelf and not much more. It would be a much better product if the shelves were wider and taller.
4,Blue Closet Organizer,The closet organizer helped me to better organize my son's closet. It is nice to have the shelves on the bottom. Now I can fit a lot more of his clothes in the closet.
3,"Wonderful product, SUPER high price!","These can be purchased in most markets that carry hispanic products for about 79 cents a can. This price is outrageous unless you wait for a deal.It is a wonderful Salsa Verde, though. I used it when I lived in Mexico and would 'doctor' it with some garlic and a little extra onion. I really couldn't tell the difference between it and my homemade version. It's fabulous with pork, especially riblets (have your butcher cut the ribs into 2 inch pieces for you.But definitely wait for a sale."
1,at least it's short,"what bugged me most about this book was michelaard's anachronistic tendency to fall back on sheer biggotry and prejudice as excuses to drive his mundane plot. these days you'd expect more sophistication, but apparently he doesn't care. while certainly a potential page turner, pegasus will outrage intelligent readers with its stereotypical characters and offensive use of racially-oriented descriptions.i mean, do you still fall for good vs. evil when it comes to geopolitics?"
3,The Pegasus Project,"The auther developed a wealth of characters that was explored. Great... but he only teased us with the air to air combat, and new technolgy. It would have been great to see more air to air. Also, the character has proven that he is an ace in the sky. Let's see some more of his flying skills It's nice to see him save his girlfriend, but I would love to have seen more air to air. Get where I'm leading to --- See Dale Brown's leading character. I would love to see more of these characters in future books. I'm hooked."
5,Great air combat story!,"It's not easy to find mass market military thrillers that combine brilliant writing with superb characterization. B. Michelaard does both. More than that, he writes with zest and stretches the mind with a massive vocabulary. This book focuses on a plausible, top-secret (""burn before reading!"") project planned by a group of ex-KGB and other fanatics to create a new and fearsome equatorial nation which will preserve communist ideals and foster terrorism. Michelaard is at his best in air combat narrative. A must book for military buffs and readers who like elegant prose."
2,Great content...Poor wuality,"I was pleasantly surprised to find this book had been reprinted. The writing style is rather antiquated as one would expect from a book written in this time frame. I had expected that. It was the poor quality of the print itself that kept me from rereading it. Perhaps this has been corrected, but as is I found it almost impossible to read."
4,It must've been a good year...,This collection includes the winners of the 2002 O. Henry Prize as well as fifteen or so of the stories short-listed for the awards. I enjoyed all of the stories in the collection though I didn't necessarily like the prize-winners best. Excellent book.
2,Don't Buy It,"A few of these stories were memorable, but last year's edition was better and so is Houghton Mifflin's ""Best American Short Stories 2002,"" which shares three of the stories. Don't worry that one of the judges edits the periodical that published the winning story -- it was one of the few intense stories in this book. Most of the stories are just character and setting studies by authors who added notes like, ""I wrote the beginning, and then I didn't know where to go with the story."" Apparently, the judges like to read about different people and places, but I don't. I like memorable stories that aren't filled with description, like the best works of O. Henry, which were not character sketches. Irony, still common in short fiction, is almost absent from this anthology."
4,Happy Breather,"I purchased two of these regulators - one for myself and one for my daughter,Both of us have been extremely happy with how they have operated and are confident in their operation and reliability.Only issue I had with the regulators is that they are a DIN set-up and not international, needed to purchase a converter to allow to fit tanks in AustraliaWould have no problems in recommending them to other drivers"
3,"""not the best work from the former King of Rap""","The best songs on this CD are ""THE BRONX"" and the GO-GOesque ""I""M CHILLIN'"". The rest is of poor quality. Musically and lyrically."
3,"One of many early incomplete, poorly executed compilations of the Nice.","When Immediate records went belly-up in 1970, the recordings from that label became heavily leased out to budget record labels and the Nice were certainly no exception. In the early 70's there were 20 if not 30 different compilations and repackaging of their recordings for Immediate, usually suffering from poor sound quality, random song selection, and if you were lucky odd and alternate mixes. In the mid-80's as the manufacture of the compact disc became cheaper, the process started all over again. This is one of those compilations. While most of the tracks featured here are good, it hardily represents a definitive collection. Given the price for this one here both new and used is under $1.00, you are not really taking too much of a risk starting here either."
4,Old but works,"The cover on this hardbound book was almost falling off from wear, but the book itself is in good condition, spine and all. The pages are yellowing and smell like an old attic, but that almost adds to it. Readable!"
5,The Green Dolphin,As advertized. The book was in excellent condition and came within a week. Great way to find an old title. Thank you to shipper.Michele Stratmeyer
1,Green Dolphin Street,The book I reeived (second hand) was too much money. I should not have paid more than $3.00 plus shipping.When I opened the package the smell of mustiness almost knocked me over and had to be set out doors in the sun for several days to dry out.
1,Too Full of Typos to Read,"I bought this edition a few months ago, excited to read more Elizabeth Goudge after reading The Bird in the Tree. So far, I've only gotten about 75 pages in. There are lots of typos on almost every page. It seems the book was scanned and never proof-read. What I've read so far intrigues me, but it's exhausting to try to puzzle out the text with all the typos.While my copy of The Bird in the Tree from the same publisher wasn't nearly as poorly edited, there were two pages of text completely missing from the book. A friend, who owns an older edition, typed the pages out for me. Since each page is important, I missed some important images and character development, as well as dialog, until I received my friend's help.I wrote to the publisher three times and have yet to receive any response. I'll be looking for a used copy and will be avoiding the new editions in future.Miss Goudge's writing is wonderful, but avoid this edition!"
4,Makes you think about your life,"This was an intriguing book that sort of goes along the lines of The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom. I could see similar thoughts as that book.Definite food for thought. This book will make you think about what your life means and has meant. The purpose of why we are here and what this all means. I don't live my life by regrets and it is because I take the time right here and right now to right the wrongs I may commit. It means something --- down the road. The author uses several different characters to represent the many of us in this world who will one day face the ""two doors""."
1,Ridiculous minimalist performance,Do not waste your money. I absolutely abhor productions where they have minimalist staging....like boring silly sliding doors in place of a Japanese home and a puppet instead of child...I would have preferred a fake doll. The voices all unmemorable. Sorry I hated this and found the movie so much more satisfying even though they did not have MET voices. Still looking for a staged performance with great staging.
3,Typical Ralph Macchio Movie,"Imagine Karate Kid in the context of a wannabe rock star and you have Crossroads. He plays a ""good guy"" role again by rescuing an old man from a convalescent home, a girl from self-desecration and his soul from being lost to the devil by allegedly playing better (with classical music, no doubt) than a smokin' fast guitar player from the hairspray 80's. I was disenchanted by the fact that like most Hollywood movies, the actor never really played any of the music you think you see him playing; that's the fantasy of movies, but I would have preferred seeing a real musician take the role of a guitar player than air-guitarist pretending to play better than Steve Vai. I only recommend this movie if you're easily moved and inspired. :)"
3,Clearing the air.,"Just to clear up some confusion. Stevie Ray Vaughan had nothing to do with this movie. He didn't play on the soundtrack nor did he play ""Eugene's"" parts in the film. Ry Cooder himself played all the blues-based guitar and slide parts and traded licks with Vai during the duel at the end."
3,OK Movie,Ralph Macchio got to play a semi-grown up and there was blues. It was a fine movie. Joe Seneca was always good.
5,Well Pleased,I was looking for this dvd for a while. I enjoyed watching again and thank you for your prompt service!
5,Tha Blues aint nothin' but a good man fellin' down.,"Although I've been playing guitar long befor I saw this movie, after watching it I took on a whole new corse of action. Since the first time, I have started to play the blues and even picked up on the harp. Watching this movie made me wish I were alive in the days when it all started. This movie will take you back the the roots of blues and show you what it's all about. The best thing of all, even if you don't play any instrument, you will LOVE this flick. Without any doubt, the duel at the end certainly made this my favorite, all time, number one, best movie out there."
5,crossroads dvd,enjoy finding some of my younger memories....loved the dvd and soundtrack....dvd was as described and the service was fast....looking forward to more
4,Crossroads or the Karate Kid Blues,"This is a great story that weaves itself around the Legendary Robert Johnson, a deal with the devil and a lost song. Ralph 'Karate Kid' Macchio delivers a great performance as Eugene, a classical guitarist that is haunted by the blues. He enlists the help of Willie Brown (Joe Seneca)an aged crotchety old man who knew Robert Johnson and cons Eugene to break him out of a home and take him on a road trip down to the home of the blues, Mississippi. Needless to say they get into a heap of trouble, and with the slide guitar supplied by Ry Cooder this film keeps you entertained all the way. The climax is the guitar duel between Eugene and Scratch (Steve Vai) for Willie's and Eugene's souls.I had been looking for this film for a long time, and it was great to get it and see it again. For the price, fantastic!"
4,Been waiting........,"We saw this movie on VHS 20 years ago & from memory - we really liked it! I bought the CD - the music is great. I've been trying to get a copy of it on DVD (or even VHS)for soooooo long & had no luck until i got onto Amazon. I wanted my guitar playing son to see it. He & my daughter both loved it too! The final ""battle"" is awesome - the underlying storyline & history is really interesting."
4,Fun,Hey..it's a movie and it's fun. Music is good and the storyline is there to enjoy. A good easy Saturday afternoon flick.
1,Crossroads & Eddie Lives,I have a copy of both Crossroads and Eddie Lives - Eddie and the Cruiser's II. Two great movies with no redeeming value except that they make you feel good. In both movies the music rules; but both are feel good also. If you get hung up on the actors you are missing the point.Music rules and both the sound and quest for sound is what it is about. Both these movies should be released on DVD. Ry Cooder/John Caffery are both under-appreciated artists.
4,Technically Correct,"I really love this video and the best part of course is the end. For the record, Steve Vai played all the guitar parts in the duel at the end. Ralph Macchio did not play any guitar (for the recorded sound in the movie) although he did learn quickly and presented a great performance that fooled many a guitar player. I think that I still have the old Guitar Player magazine where Ry Cooter talked about the making of the movie and who played what parts. A great movie for any real guitar player."
4,Crossroads Rocks,"The VCR ate my video one evening so I immediately jumped on the web to see if I could get it on DVD and of course Amazon had it! I had it in three or four days and have already watched it twice... again. Not only does it ""rock"" as in a good movie, it rocks with its musical content... it you like this kind of jivey kinda music and I do. I just pass over the language of which it has plenty and concentrate on the story-line and the actual musical content. Joe Seneca's character is cantankerous and steals the show. A fun movie... for me."
3,"Good movie, bad casting.","The karate kid plays the blues. This can be a good introduction to the scene, but don't stop here. Pick-up some Son House, Ledbelly, or Muddy Waters (the list is endless). Or for a real education head south. The first time I was on Beale ST. was a lesson.I have seen this movie many times and I do like it. If this movie was approched more from an artisitic standpoint than a ""let's make some money"", it could have been a classic."
3,"Great movie, disappointing DVD","Plot summaries of this movie abound, so I won't rehash them. The movie is wonderful, but the long-awaited DVD issue is disappointing. It is in widescreen and the transfer quality is fine, but it has no extras and only a two-channel soundtrack.While it's worth buying anyway, a 5.1 soundtrack and a good commentary would have really made it a great deal."
4,"Road movie, but with a nice twist of blues music,and also, a good plot.","Macchio is a young classic guitar player, but he also loves blues. His search for the best blues tune gets him in touch with the Devil... You should find how and why, and also how can he (if) can get out of this."
5,Crossroads,"This is truly a good movie. The more into the movie...the better it gets. I think this movie gets overlooked quite often, but the music and the acting are good. Ralph Macchio is brilliant!"
4,Small Problem With DVD,"Ordered, Delivered promptly, properly packaged, works well. Small dissatisfaction with the fact that Chinese Subtitles appear part way through the movie distracting but not destroying enjoyment of movie."
4,Important Correction,"Unfortunately, in this excellent movie the main character states that it was Eric Clapton who revitalized the song entitled Crossroads. Crossroads was covered by the band Cream in their great 1967 album Wheels of Fire. Eric Clapton was the gifted lead guitarist of Cream. But it was Jack Bruce, singer, songwriter and bass player who was the leader and driving force behind the band. Jack Bruce is the one who should have been mentioned in the movie, not Eric Clapton. Cream was a great band that also featured Ginger Baker, another rock legend on drums. Another supergroup of the same era, Led Zeppelin used Robert Johnson's lyrics in their track entitled The Lemon Song but they did not give Johnson credit."
4,Great movie but not much new on DVD...,"The movie is great in my opinion but there really isn't anything spectacular about the DVD. Still, the movie transfers great to DVD and if you like the blues you'll like this movie!"
3,This had the potential to be the ultimate guitar movie,"But unfortunately we have Ralph Macchio. He's so annoying in this flick that you just can't stand watching it. The rest of the cast is great and Steve Vai is awesome in the duel at the end. Great story, great music, and outstanding climax, but it has Ralph and when he isn't painfully hamming it up, he's just annoying. They gotta do a remake."
3,One major flaw,"This movie has all the right elements. From script to directing to supporting cast to the music is all excellent. But Ralph Macchio is just the wrong choice for the lead role. Coming fresh off of Karate Kid, the role he will always be remembered for, Macchio just can't shake off that character, and in fact just reprises his Karate Kid role in a different environment. So instead of a great movie about the blues, we have Karate Kid meets the blues. I'm sure the choice of Macchio was all about marquee value and pulling an audience who would not otherwise pay to watch a movie about the blues. But how many 13 year old girls who went to see Macchio in this 1986 film really cared about the blues? And how many blues fans really felt that Macchio was right for the role? Count 'em on one hand! If you can erase the Karate Kid image from your mind, this movie is a loving tribute to the blues accompanied by excellent blues music. I just can't give it more than 3 stars because of mis-casting."
4,The devil's music,"A fairly conventional Hollywood coming-of-age road picture, with an interesting motif: country blues. A Juliard student (Ralph Macchio) is in love with the blues, especially the Delta bluesman Robert Johnson, and he's determined that Johnson recorded 30 songs, not 29 as reported. In order to find out what the 30th song might be, he seeks the help of Willie Brown (played by Joe Seneca), a character mentioned in one of Johnson's records. Macchio busts Seneca out of a nursing home in NYC, and together they head for the Delta. He meets a girls who introduces him to love, and then she dumps him (gotta suffer to play the blues). The ending is a bit over the top: Macchio meets the devil (a rocker!) and they duel it out; no surprise about who wins. The music is the real plus here, especially Johnson's recording of ""Crossroads"" as the opening credits role. In truth, Johnson did only record 29 titles; whether Macchio comes to this realization I can't remember."
3,"Excellent musid, weak plot","I liked this film mostly for its superb music. The story is really just a remake of the ""Karate Kid"" and rather weak at that. Maccino as Eugene is clearly too young and he is not up to the dialogue. But the music, oh boy. Made me want to go out and buy lots and lots of the original titles. Which is a bit difficult since I am in germany. Can someone provide me with the discography?"
4,Steve Vai is f-ing awesome,"Hiya there. This is the first review I have written, ever, for anything. I think this was an unbelieveable movie. My dad showed it to me because when i started playing his guitars, I started getting into Joe Satriani. So he said, ""You like Satch? You'll never believe this guy."" So we watched the movie, and I am still in awe. I think that Steve Vai is sooo talented and gifted and I just wish that someday I could be that good! Oh yeah, and on a different note, it was actually Stevie Ray Vaughan that played Ralph Macchio's parts, not Steve Vai. I read that Barry guy's review and I was like ""DUDE! no no no, Honestly..."" So in reality, it was actually Stevie Ray Vaughan who played Ralph's guitar parts in the duel at the end. But either way, the music was jaw-dropping and I absolutely love it. Four out of five stars."
1,Sony ignores influence,"Crossroads is a great movie, but the long awaited DVD release leave a lot to be desired. As a DVD release, this movie only gets one star.This movie inspired many, many people to pick up at learn guitar, including myself. Sony ignores the influence this movie had on guitar players.For Sony not to include a single bonus extra, interview, or even backstory on the ledgend of Robert Johnson it a complete and utter shame.It's awfully high priced not to include anything extra.It does have Japanese subtitles though. Big frigging deal!"
2,"More Vai, less devil","Aside from an inspired performance by the late Joe Seneca, this film is a throwaway. Joe's character, Willie Brown, is the only one we care about. Ralph Macchio is every bit as annoying as he'd been in the Karate Kid and the story...well, Joe wants to break a contract with the devil. Need I say more? The final showdown with the dark lord won't put any of your neck hairs on end, and the outcome will be predicted by your 12-year old. But also in that scene late in the movie, there's some pretty flashy guitar picking going on, thanks to uncredited virtuoso Steve Vai. Hallelujuh for that part."
4,Full Satisfaction,Everything came as expected. Good price for a good product. Actually excellent price. The only gripe that I have would be the shipping and handling which was more than the product. Thanks. No Complaints here.
4,Looking forward to this release on........ DVD,"Thanks, Steve from Antelope, CA United States. I was on here looking for information on the release of the movie ""Crossroads""I hope your release date of 8/26/04 is correct, I can't wait.I saw this movie back in 86' and loved it. I play guitar, and ifyou play guitar,I think you'll enjoy this movie. Blues is really the foundation for rock n roll. Trust me, if your just starting out on guitar, there's nothing like learning some old blues licksto get you going.Anyways, Great guitar dual at the end.....this is really where the movie sucks you in!!!"
5,Great Movie and Fast Service.,"I bought this movie for my dad because he has been searching for it for years and we could never find it. Thankfully amazon.com had it available and I ordered it right away. It is a very good movie for those who havent seen it. The delivery service was quick and easy. I ordered the product on Monday and it arrived at my door on Wednesday. It seems to be in great condition, with no issues. I am very sastified."
4,If you are a Blues history fan this is a fun movie.,I would recommend this movie to those who enjoy a story with human interest and texture. The movie has references to the culture of the Blues the history of race in the South and the simple humanity of people trying to find their way united by a desire to make music.
5,olde but goodie...,"I have seen this film before but saw it for purchase an Amazon and had to have it. Its a classic, but the main point is the Amazon service. Its great"
4,DELTA DELIGHT,Any one with an interest in blues music MUST watch this.I believe I saw the ghosts of many legends of the blues and I was profoundly moved by the experience
5,Mistaken review,The previous review is 100% incorrect. I have a Geneve Presidential watch that has the same band on it that I bought new in 1993. I still have the original box and paperwork. This was purchased through a reputable jeweler brand new. Some time people make mistakes ust thought I should correct it so other are not mis-lead.
5,"L. R, Atlanta, GA",This is a good book. I found the story to be very uplifting. Some parts brought tears to my eyes and others brought a smile.I was reminded that we all have strength that we somehow find when it's truly needed.
1,No Battery Life - BAD OVERHEATING PROBLEM,"This is a great piece of machinery, if you can get it to run for more than 20-20 minutes before it overheats and shuts down. When used on my desk, would last about an hour without overheating, but the battery is almost dead by then anyway. Good idea, not enough research before production. Video and Audio are THE BEST for a laptop though. Even Toshiba admits that there is a problem now (they wouldn't before). Mine was a newer model, purchased about a month ago.... Better Processor, and included an external USB 1.44 floppy too. If you can stand buying a fan to blow on it all the time, good machine, but I give it 1 STAR because a laptop/notebook should be able to be used as one, not have to be on a desk with extra fans. Oh, and Toshiba reps are AWFULL when they're at fault, but great when just need a little help."
3,Caveat Emptor!,"I love Toshiba laptops in general, and the features on this model lured me in, especially the huge hard drive, large RAM and great graphics card. However.....this is a *VERY* strange oversight on their part....they have placed in it a chip that requires serious cooling (the kind laptops never offer) after as little as 20 minutes of crunching. Without the cooling, the chip reaches its max temp quickly and then unceremoniously shuts down until it cools sufficiently, resulting in an annoying loss of data. Toshiba is not exactly forthright about the whole matter, but I have a trade in the works with them for a Toshiba that uses the *mobile* (MIII) chip that will solve the problem.As far as I can see, there is no fix on the horizon, and so this model is soon destined for the dustbin."
2,"Good Plan, Bad Execution","Toshiba had a good idea with this notebook, but they have some poor design flaws that really hold it back. First off it has a terrible overheating problem that one user mentioned before, I am in the process of getting a refund. It wont affect you till after about 3 weeks, then it will all break loose. This notebook as a Pentium III, DESKTOP CPU, no no NOT a MOBILE, a DESKTOP, so of course, it heats up and causes problems. It also eats battery like there is no tomorrow. At first I was amazed, but after time, it began to have more and more problems. Check out the toshiba support forum before you buy it. I am going to get the 5105-s607 to replace it. No one has reported problems with it yet.. Good Luck"
2,nice notebook but...,"3 months ago I bought one this. Trust me, this notebook is the most beautiful I have see. In the firts 2 weeks I play Medal Of Honor at maximun settings without problems, the sound is a master as the display. Everething was great and then...The graphics start to become slooow. The 3Dmark drop from 3700(new) to 1800(hot). I contact Toshiba and they tell me to upgrade to the new Bios over the Toshiba site. I did it, but the graphics still slooow. Slower than 3005 S307. And a big surprise:The new Bios down the CPU speed about 25% when CPU become HOT.I bought this notebook as a Pentium 1.1mhz not as 800mhz, but this is the speed that you can reach when you most need, because Toshiba put a desktop CPU. The 3005 S304/S307 have mobile CPU.If you want a serios notebook don't buy 5005 S507 or any other notebook with desktop CPU...At final analysis this is a good notebook but if you want a notebook to play, this is not the best."
2,Not worth it,"I am frankly surprised at the positive reviews this book has received. It is badly overpriced for what it offers--a cheap self-publishing venture featuring a stapled `binding', poor grammar, and vague directions. It shows (or attempts to show) how to build only one type of sauna: a 2-by-4-framed Western Red Cedar box with fiberglass insulation intended for an indoor installation. There is some useful information here, but the author doesn't provide enough detail for the beginner, and anyone with some experience will be able to find anything he needs on the Net for free."
4,The Art of Sauna Making,Written in the 90's to an audience that is ill informed on SaunasI would say it gives enough info to build a sauna but uses quotes that are unrealistic.All in all it was dorky but fun to read
4,Useful product,"For kids rooms with little space, this organizer is very useful for diaper and diaper accessory storage."
4,A beautiful piece...,"This watch winder was just what I was looking for. My father has two automatic watches and had wanted a watch winder for a while. I found this and thought it was beautiful. When I got it, it is rather big, but the finish is clean and very nicely put together. The sound of the winder is not overwhelming, though may drive someone crazy if they have great hearing and it is showcased in your bedroom. All in all, I would say for the money this is a superb choice!"
2,"Good news, bad news","Beautiful woodwork. Works well, though settings are complicated. One of the winders stopped working after I had the unit a couple of months. The circumference of the timepiece holders are a little large and overly complicated for my watches, so they fit very tightly. A simple pillow would seem to be a better solution."
3,Okay but not really the best learning system,"I bought this and the Igoe DVD at the same time. As an old man learning to play for the first time I need all the help I can get. It is an interesting approach on how to incorporate the drums but in my opinion there wasn't any thing ultimate about it. If you are going to buy a video, I would suggest Igoe's."
4,Great intro into drumming.,"This is an easy to follow and well organized intro into learning to play the drums. I was playing along with the DVD less than an hour after I got it! However, it does leave the learner feeling like there could have been more beats introduced, and more rythyms discussed. But overall a very good way to introduce yourself to a drum kit."
5,Great drumming learning tool!,"As previous reviewers stated, very clear step by step instructions.Very informative for the beginners and unlike other learning tools not boring at all - fun to learn! I could play the first bit he explains just in a few hours. If you want to learn how to play drums, buy it, you will not regret this."
3,Basic beginner video,"I guess I am a little more advanced than I thought, this is a nice ""beginner video"""
3,A real review,"I like this DVD. The instructor is informative and interesting. You can learn a little from the DVD too. It's great because you don't really need drums to play either.With that being said, you still need an instructor to properly learn drums. If you are really serious I would check out ""Syncopation for the modern drummer"" book. That book is a much better value."
4,Mecca,"While it ranks high overall in what they have done, this is maybe not the place to start if you want to get in Cabaret Voltaire. It was still in their real avant-garde electronic phase and remains difficult and challenging today."
5,milagrosos alimentos curativos,"Despues de la Biblia, este es unos de los mejores libros, tiene alimentos para cualquier enfermedad, como prevenir y curar. Lo recomiendo a todos en Ingles o Espanol, es un regalo muy oportuno es estos tiempos deficiles. Faciel de leer y entender."
4,Please try harder to speak as we do...,"Yes, I did enjoy the book very much, although images of Mrs Haig-Ereildoun stayed with me long after. I've known a hundred of her type and that is just the type I was happy to leave behind me when I emigrated to the States over 20 years ago.But a little more research would have gone a long way. It grates to hear that Melissa and Simon 'entered Whitehall' to see Parliament sitting. And as for falling into the neophyte's trap of talking about 'one pence', well, one wonders how long Marjorie spent in the UK before writing the book."
5,Excellent telephoto converter,"A high quality screw-on 2x lens for video cameras. Aluminum and glass construction -- heavy, but solidly built. I was quite impressed when adding to the 10x optical zoom on my Sony DCR-PC330. A very distant cabin in the mountains came out surprisingly clear and sharp, considering the distance. A fine addition to my video camera bag."
3,Regular lens,This is a 2X lens that in some light conditions reflects the internal lens system in the picture...
4,Great sweatshirt!,"This sweatshirt was a great value for the price. It is a very nice, quality made sweatshirt. My husband loved it."
2,Registration problem,If you want to register this product you will need to get a USB cable to connect online. Garmin does not supply and the USB connection is not a standard one. This is my 1st GPS & I received as a gift. It will be the last one that I will buy from Garmin.
3,Not So Nuvi,"i got my wife one from Best Buys and its all right when it works right. its a bit late on directions and or gives directions for no reason. example, tells you to exit here after you pass the exit and tells you about an exit thats not there. this is not all the time though. its not that bad. can get frustrating. you find yourself arguing and fighting with the device at times. then it has to recalculate. it is simple and easy to use though. perfect size. not big at all. so i recommended it to my friend as a gift for his wife.i placed the order for him. i received the package early from the shipper. no complaints. good deal with the 2 added accessories from the shipper. i paid more just for the device by itself from Best Buy than what my friend paid from Amazon and it included 2 extra accessories(GPS case and stand)!!!"
3,Like New not Brand new,"I got the opened box, I believed it was opened and used already but never mine I need it urgently... no time to return and get a new oneSo far, it works well , sometimes it takes too long to upload the map in my garage."
1,unhappy with Garmin navigaton system,"I am VERY unhappy. I buy things online as I don't have time to run around to 'shop', so I don't have time to go somewhere to ship these TINY systems back to you. You should list the dimensions of the screen like they do for TV's. The screen is so SMALL that my elderly parents for whom I bought the 2 units, can not see the screen and drive at the same time. They do not talk loud enough for a person with hearing challenges. I feel I have spent $360.00 for useless equipment. I am NOT happy!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Garmin nuvi 200,it will get you there. it may sometimes tell you to turn an incorrect direction but it will alway re-direct you to the right location.
5,Garmin Nuvi 200,"I already own a Garmin Nuvi 200 and just bought one for my wife. I do not know if the new maps were available at the time MV ""M"" purchased his but they are available now via [...]. The Garmin Nuvi is a nice sized GPS unit that it very easy to use and for me, Garmin customer support has provided world class service.With this GPS, you get alot of bang for your buck!"
5,This is great!,"We got this Garmin nuvi 200 for my daughter, she just moved and needed something to help her get around. We had the Garmin streetpilot for 2 years and love it and this is just as good if not better. I would definitly buy another one."
4,Garmin Nuvi 200,"We took our Garmin GPS on a road trip of over two thousand miles. We found it extremely helpful in guiding us to our different destinations. We were able to locate, restaurants, libraries, hotels, museums and other points of interest without having to study a map or endlessly stopping to ask directions. I'm sure it saved us hours of time and much frustration.The only problem I see on the horizon is that it will become outdated. My model is current as of July of 2007. We have already found a few places where roads have been altered and where the GPS became confused. It would be helpful if the manufacturer included information about how, if possible, to update the system."
3,garmin nuvi200,"Works OK, but on two occasions, the second time I used it, it gave me completely wrong directions. And in one instance, it told me to turn the wrong way onto a one way road. The only way I could get it to recalibrate was to turn it off then back on. Good price compared to elsewhere, but these things aren't all that they're cracked up to be. Better off with Google maps."
4,Garmin Nuvi 200,My Garmin Etrex died after 8 years so I bought the Nuvi 200 to use both in the car and for Geocaching--love it.
4,good model if you're on a budget,"If you're not looking to spend a lot of money on a GPS unit and you just want the basics this will perform well for you.My first trip with this unit was a 550 mile drive from the Carolinas to Pennsylvania. I jumped in the car in the morning plugged in the address and away I went. It calculated the route within a reasonable amount of time and only lost the satellite signal when going through tunnels. There was one point in the trip when the unit went crazy ""recalculating"" over and over. Apparently, this unit ships with some out-of-date maps.Overall though, it's a solid buy for the money providing basic GPS functionality."
3,Convenient product,"This is our first GPS so I do not have any others to compare it to. It's so fun to be able to put in a destination and have ""someone"" tell you exactly how to get there. I love it especially when I'm by myself and I don't have someone to read the map or directions for me. However there have been several times that I was on my way somewhere and got the message, ""lost satellite"". I don't know if this is a problem with this product or what but it was very inconvenient, to say the least. Now I always make sure I print out directions to bring with me in case my GPS goes off again."
4,You can trust it.,"Just a basic device, pretty reliable, no fancy functions. It doesn't have the function to direct you to the nearest restaurant or hotel, which I think are useful."
5,Highly Recommended,"This does exactly what I need it to do and nothing more; Finds things nearby and takes me there. Very simple to set up. The software is already pre-loaded. You stick it in your car and turn it on. I highly recommend this GPS.I want to clarify one point of confusion. A lot of people were complaining that when they received the unit, it was preloaded with the old maps. It now comes pre-loaded with 2008 version."
3,Great value if you update the maps,"This will do exactly what a GPS should, no fancy gimmicks or speech, but it will precisely guide you where you need to be. If you update it to the latest maps, you will be set for a long time."
5,Garmin GPS,I bought this for my husband as a gift mostly because I always wanted one. It is very easy to set up and operate. We both love it. It is a great item and a great price. I would highly recommend it.
5,Great Basic GPS!!!,"I Purchased 9 of these for a small fleet of Service Electricians. They have all told me ""wow I couldn't have found that job with out this thing"" and ""I don't get lost any more"". I am very satisfied with this purchase. Thank you Garmin!"
4,Good for the price,Just bought my garmin 200. Has all the features you really need from a GPS. Does nto have text to speech which would be nice but you can read clearly the name of the street on the Garmin. Speaker is loud screen is beaituful. Very fast at picking up coordinates. A great deal.
3,Nice Idea for Bicycle Use,I purchased the unit for use on a bicycle and it is great to have on a bicycle but beware of the battery life. It will not last for a 3 to 4 hour rides. It can also take a long time to find a signal when used in a vehicle. Sometimes a few miles! Overall it is a great concept but could still use a little more development.
5,Perfect for the price range!,"This is the first GPS unit that I have ever owned and it worked great! I use this for work routes and it helps a lot. You can input a route and it will give multiple ways to get there by just clicking the detour button. Also, It will power up when you start the car and power down when you turn off your car. In addition, it is expandable with an SD card bay. Overall, the best thing about this unit is that it clips on and off to the mount easily and can carry it around in your pocket to take in other cars. The battery lasts long too!"
4,Garmin Nuvi 200,"I bought this for Christas as an entry level GPS, and so far it has worked pretty well. It is very easy to use and it provides clear instructions with appropriate anticipation. I have, however, had a couple of situations in which I have been unable to find places that I know for a fact exist, but that has more to do with the software than the product itself. Overall, I think this is a great entry level device. Some of the features are unnecessary in my opinion - currency exchange, for example - but the device does what I paid for it to do - get me to places."
4,Garmin nuvi 200,"This is a backup and portable unit for me. It does not have all of the bells & whistles of the more pricey units ,but does a very fine job for a unit in this price range."
4,Garmin,"I have seen other GPS's recently and this unit by far is the most user friendly, regardless of the price. It does just what I needed it to do, and the price was very good. Thanks"
3,More than shortest route required,"I have one thing to add to the other reviews on the Garmin 200. Despite generally competent performance it tends to be VERY STUPID in picking certain routes. Apparently it goes for the shortest route without giving any weight or consideration to the nature of the roads themselves. Thus, going from Blacksburg, VA, to Roanoke, VA, it selects a narrow torturousstate road, which one drives at one's peril, especially at night, insteadof the fast, safe and efficient US 460 - Interstate 81 route which any informed person would take. I have been reluctant to put it on my wife'svehicle for this reason.D. L. RussellBlacksburg, VA"
5,Garmin Nuvi 200 Navigation,Works great. Put in an address for a museum that was 90 miles from my home. It took me to the front door even though we were forced to detour twice because of road closings in our path. When we turned off the course the Garmin recalculated in a few seconds with new directions to take. We use it all the time even in our city to find a new address we have not been to before.
1,Doesn't work as advertised - returning unit,"I just returned my Garmin nuvi 200 after trying to drive to The Bronx from Manhattan and it many errors (almost sent me to NJ on the GWB coming back!). These days most digital products just work so I thought going with low-end model should be fine - I don't need fancy features, just a basic GPS that works. Within half an hour out of the box the unit sent me the wrong way several times including telling me to stay in the left lane of a four-lane highway - then later saying get in the right lane to exit. It also kept saying ""recalculating route"" even when I was following the route that it had me on. It might work fine for country roads but in NY this GPS did not meet my (basic) expectations. I need to buy a new GPS but am hesitant to purchase another one from Garmin."
2,"Horrible Packaging, No Instructions Included",The navigation system is good but how amazon wrapped it and sent it was bad. I received my package and inside the outer box was everything scattered. The real Garmin box was opened and their was pieces of the garmin in the outer box. No instruction manual.
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,Received the Garmin 200 as a gift. Within weeks it stopped working. Apparently because it did not malfunction within the 30 day return period. Amazon refused to issue a refund. Now I am stuck with a non working GPS.
1,"Nice, but of little value --","I've waited three months, using this device locally and on long trips, before writing this review. It is a very nice gadget, but of little help. Locally, it invariably wants me to follow a longer, convoluted route to my destination. On trips to distant locations, it offers no advantage over a printed map. And it is not that the local map is deficient. Once I turn onto the direct route to my destination, the program accepts my decision and reveals all of the streets correctly. But to enter a local address is entirely too difficult and time consuming, without being directed on an indirect, inefficient route to that address."
5,No more driving in circles,"This item was shipped and delivered much faster than estimated. Works great, very user friendly!!"
3,Okay but not good enough.,"Garmin nuvi 200 is good but I would suggest you get the next model (nuvi 260). Pay extra money and it's worth. I purchased the nuvi 200 andwhile using it I found out that it does not tell the streets name while making a turn. (I read some of the reviews, but still buy this model).I have no choice but to use this unit (nuvi 200) even do I'm not satisfied. I know it will not be easy to return and exchange this item since I bought it online. Just to return and exchange might be an agony and cost me more for shipping.Suggestions: If your not maticulous buy this item, otherwise buy the 260 model and you won't regret it."
5,Great GPS for the $$$,I purchased the Garmin NUVI 200 for about $125.This is a great GPS for the money. Does what it is supposed to do and does it very well. Not sure what bells and whistles this unit doesn't have but gives me great directions.I would recommend GARMIN over all others based on my experience.
4,"I like it, but...","This little gadget has been very helpful lately. We moved to a new area and we have heavily relied on it's wisdom. The only problem I have with it is the search feature. It seems to take a long time pull up a list. For example if you ask for nearby food options it takes a LONG time to compile said list. But otherwise it's fab, and we're really glad we have it."
3,Great for the price.,"I was looking for an entry-level GPS for basic navigation duty. I researched online and settled on the nüvi 200.First impressions were very positive. The product looks and feels expensive and well made. The screen is bright and has a glare-resistant coating that make it viewable in most situations.Like some other reviews state, if you are looking for additional features you really should look elsewhere. But for getting from point A to point B this is a great unit."
4,Effective and affordable basic option,"No bells and whistles to get in the way here. Keeping it simple often means being less confusing, which can be very important when trying to find your way or prevent losing it."
4,Interesting,This is a very good product and easy to use. I have had this nuvi for a few years now but the only problem is that it sometimes malfunctions. While it is usually accurate sometimes it is not and sometimes recalculates your route unneccessarily. I would recomment buying a newer model.
5,Consumer Reports #1 GPS as of Feb 2008,This GPS is everything Consumer Reports said it would be. I use it daily and love it.My previous GPS unit was stolen and was about 2 years old. So it is great to see the price has dropped while the size has also gotten considerably smaller and the options are much more user friendly.Very good!
5,Great product for great price.,"Long did I decide on my first GPS and have to say, I made an awesome decision. Don't look too long to the negative statements, rather on the positive on. Will be your time and money worth."
4,very convinient module,"It 's very easy to use. So far, the GPS direction instruction is accurate. the resolution is about 20 to 40 meters. Some time, the satellites serching is some slowly."
2,Reburnished need to be atleast check before shipping,"i got the reburnished box with missing part, otherwise its good. vendor has to atleast check the reburnished box to make sure all parts are in place."
4,Good Product,I suggest to the Amazon customers to buy this producte. It is friedly to use and the price is amazing.Bye
4,The best and simple GPS,"Hi, if you need only routing capability (no off road track log, saved routes) this is by far one of the best ans simple GPS in the market.4 of 5 stars: It does'n come with power adapter for home/office it is doesn't come with case."
4,Nuvi 200 is great!,"This is a great little gadget for just getting around a city you dont know too well or for giving you any sort of direction. though it doesnt tell you street names of where to turn, which i found would have been more helpful, but it is still great because the map has everything you need to know. i recommend it highly, it is very user friendly and works pretty slick. great buy."
5,Cool machine,"I just recieved my new GPS unit from Amazon.And I have tested it.The first thing to pop threw my head while driving with this thing was ""Where have you been all of my life?"" It is a realy nice gadget.It will come in handy with my job.Where I do deleverys to The Saint Louis area twice a week.And other places.Theres been lots of times where my boss would call and ask me to go some place new.Then I would get a headache trying to find the place.Now that I have a GPS unit I'm hopping my problems will now go away.And just today at work my boss has asked me to go to a new place in Saint Louis.So I told him to give me the address and now I have it program in my Garmin GPS Unit. I also like how it gives you a list of local restaurants as I love going out eat.So if you are in the mood for pizza,BBQ,Mexican the gadget will tell you where you can eat.It is realy a neat toy.Glade I got it."
3,New Garmin,I purchased this product just after Christmas. It stopped working after 3 weeks. I contacted Amazon and the return process was so easy. I had a new unit within 3 days. So far it's working well. I don't go anywhere without it. It hasn't steered me wrong yet.
5,Simply Amazing!,"I got this for my brother-in-law this Christmas and he loves this thing.This is a summary of why it is so awesome;1) It's a car thing - My brother-in-law likes cars and this is basically a car gadget; it's that simple.2) The GPS works - I fly into Chicago often and he usually picks me up. Getting to the airport is now ultra simple, whereas it usually is a pain. Naming the streets did not seem to matter that much as the GPS will tell you stuff like 'stay left' or 'turn right in 0.2 miles' (to prepare you) as you get close and then 'turn right' ~100ft before the turn off - it is very accurate.3) Other features - You could know exactly where you are going and still use the thing. The ETA is helpful. Finding a point of interest (i.e. restaurant) is helpful and the speedometer / average speed is just very neat.This is a great gift for almost anyone."
2,Need to get somewhere slow...this is the one for you!,"I am baffled that no one else has pointed out the obvious with this thing! On several occassion over a 2 DAY PERIOD this thing had me taking the long way just about everywhere I went. It had me going through street lights in Oakland for 12 miles! I later found out that I was running parallel to a freeway the whole time! It would have me take earlier exits than necessary and then I'd take surface streets for miles and miles. I was glad when the 3 hour battery life came to an end and I was forced to get out my big bulky laptop with 5 year old maps and was at least able to get to my destinations without having to add 2 hours onto my trip. When I returned it to Walmart the associate said, ""oh, I have this same one! She said she loves it but she doesn't always follow it's directions because it frequently has you going the long way!"" Well, if you are like her and have ooodles of time to waste, this is the one for you!"
4,Best for the money,"This is my extended family's 5th nuvi 200. We like the simplicity of the model and the low profile compared to the original boxy designs from a few years ago. A zip code input option would be nice, but it's worth not having to get such a good price on a quality Garmin unit."
3,OK product but has pretty bad flaws,"I received my Garmin Nuvi 200 (250) about 2 weeks ago and have found certain flaws in this GPS system. The first is that the old version map (V8)comes with the system and you need to pay another $75 to upgrade. Also when the weather is a little bit cloudy then the satellites are hard to make contact with. This might be the result of having no external antenna.I just returned from a trip to Canada and while I was leaving Canada the system almost redirected me to reenter Canada. Of course, I used common sense and did not reenter, but this is certainly a flaw that must be pointed out.If the skies are clear this system is a very good system but otherwise I think that there is a good chance you might get lost with this system,thus defeating the purpose of having GPS in the first place. I would not recommend this system to anyone until Garmin corrects some of the problems mentioned."
1,Watch out -- Map Updates cost $70 +,"I purchased my Garmin in November 2007. In September 2008, the Garmin completely stopped functioning and directed me to purchase a map update on their site. I went to the site and discovered that I needed to first purchase a USB cable to connect the device. $20 and two weeks later, the cable arrived.I logged onto the Garmin's website and went through an hour long product registration process to see if I qualified for a free map update. At the end of a frustrating hour long registration, I was told that I did not qualify for a free map update and got a 10% coupon for select products.The map update for this device is $70 and the 10% discount did not apply to this update. Since my Garmin is useless without this update, I decided purchase it. The download took 4 hours on a high speed connection. If you purchase this device, beware that annual updates will cost almost as much as the device."
1,About Garmin Nuvi GPS,This is a waste of time! I rated the seller very poor coz i did not received the item. I want a full refund of my money $49.99.
3,Didn't ship on time!,"This product was guaranteed to arrive by Dec. 24 and was ordered Dec. 13. It did not arrive and when tracked, the deliverer claimed to have attempted delivery prior to 12/24 and most cefinitely did not!!! I won't try another Christmas purchase with Amazon based on this."
3,Was very surprized,Got the product for $222.00 after 3 weeks product dropped in price to $191 then a few more days went by and I saw the price drop to $169.00. I felt I got ripped off!
2,Garmin Nuvi 200,"Having already used a Garmin Nuvi 370, we were very disappointed with the Nuvi 200. We intend to replace it with the 370 which is far superior. The 200 does not name any of the streets to turn at. It only tells you to turn in point x miles which is not at all helpful when you are driving in an area you are not familiar with. The 370 warns you ahead of time the name of the street to turn at and repeats the name at the point of turning. Just listen and drive. Much easier than having to look down at your Garmin screen and try to read the map.Garmin nüvi 200 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator"
4,"Used nuvi 200 on trip to Atlanta, GA","I used my Nuvi on trip to Atlanta, GA and without it I would have been lost. It took me to the door of hotel and door of the office building. It was of help in navigating Atlanta's interstate system. Only issue I have is it takes a couple of minutes to connect with satellite."
2,Disappointing,My Garmin NUVI was working okay for a couple months and then lost all of the data that I entered for Favorites places. The manual and website are no help trying to what happened and the customer support is next to useless. They keep answering emails with more questions rather than giving answers.
4,"Simple, affordable, and easy to use","It may not out perform you in areas you're familiar with, but who actually need a GPS in this case anyway. With less than 200 dollars you get a pocket size GPS with a bright touch screen and 6 million Points of Interests. Next thing I do: start driving."
4,Nuvi 200,I've had my Nuvi 200 for a month and used it for a rare trip to a large city. My spouse doesn't drive in cities but was forced to on this trip as I was unable. I changed navigation settings to exclude Highways and the route calculated was precisely how I would have driven there. Life saver.
3,Disappointed with the 2008 map,"I just ordered this product May 1st. I read the cautions here about the possibility of old maps. When I checked under Tools > Settings > Map, I discovered that I did get the 2008 City Navigator maps but only for the 48 continental states, no Hawaii and no Puerto Rico as indicated on the features table on this website.It also failed to locate the Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom stores in McLean, VA which I knew that had been there for years.Other than that I am ok with the product so far. I wish it had an external switch for volume. I may also swap it for a model that has text to speech to know the street names I am supposed to turn next."
3,"Entry level, missing some important features","Overall, I do like the product. However, I have quickly found the lack of spoken street names to be a real problem with this unit. Sometimes the on-screen directions don't match up well with the actual maneuvers you will take."
2,Not very pleased,I can't believe that the other people are talking about the same gps. It was hard to program and slow to respond. I saw the hourglass far more than any maps. The points of interest must not be in my area. It did not locate a Dunkin Donuts 3 blocks away and Hershey Lodge was a complete mystery. I previously had a Tom Tom But my daughter talked into giving it to her. I am returning this Garmin 200 and chalking it up to a lesson learned.
2,works great... when it works.,"I purchased a Garmin Nuvi 200 about a month ago. It worked great and had no problems for about a month. Then things went downhill. The unit would no longer connect to the satellites. It would find the satellites for about a minute then it would lose them again.I called Garmin's help line and I stayed on hold for 30+ minutes. When I finally got through, the I.T. guy was very kind and somewhat helpful. He gave me a ""quick fix"" that usually works (so he says) but the fix was only temporary. It went right back to having the exact same problem. Over all, I would not recommend this unit."
5,Very Good Entry Level GPS,I wanted cheap and got more than I required. This is a very nice GPS for the money.
2,"Product is good, support could be better","I think the Nuvi is a good product, but I learned a valuable lesson: I hemmed and hawwed about whether to buy the product on this website or to buy a refurbished one, and decided to buy it hear because I didn't want to deal with sending back a broken unit. Well, I had my Nuvi 2 weeks and it white-screened on my way back home one day. Support at Garmin was responsive, but of course they make the CUSTOMER pay for shipping back THEIR defective product! Not impressed with that customer service!"
2,Garman nuvi 200 gets it wrong >50%,"I've had it in use for about 3months now and the Garman is easy to use if you're not looking for an address that is on a highway. To be more precise, if you're going to 123 Main St., you'll be okay if you don't mind alot of extra turns and stops. If you're going to 123 Hwy6 or loop410, then you better check a map. Be prepared for the Garman to get you lost or tired of making u-turns. I have set it to avoid u-turns, take the quickest route or shortest route but it dosn't matter: it loves taking the route with the most traffic lights [forget freeways]!Screen size seems ample but don't expect a user guide or book to come with it. You'll have to 'guess' at how best to set it up and or how to use it.I gave it 2 stars just because of the price [<$165] and it seems consistant with what I've heard of other type devices. I've used a built in model on an Acura, it was very nice and seemed alot smarter than my Garman.Garmin nüvi 200 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator"
4,You are here...,"I got this on the spur of the moment in preparation for a driving vacation.It was convenient to be able to look up the location for my bank in Pahrump, Nevada, choose from a list of restaurants categorized by type of food, find each of the motels I would be staying at, or just getting directions to a location in Southern California.The built-in features such a odometer, estimated arrival time, ""favorite locations"" etc are all handy. You can add one waypoint detour on your way to a destinationIt comes with a car charger that plugs into the back, and will run for about 5 hours on batteries. I don't use the clip-on dashboard stand, but instead just have the unit on the passenger seat.It is possible to upgrade or add maps and points-of-interest via an SD card.You can buy something fancier with traffic reports, etc, but this unit makes a great travel aid."
5,First time GPS user,I went on a road trip with a hi-tech nephew. It was the first time I saw a GPS. He told me to buy the Nuvi and that's what I did. Now I don't see how I can get along without one.
5,Great GPS for the price,"This is by far the best GPS on the market for the price. I have this one and the NUVI 660 and if I had it to do over I would have just bought 2 of these and saved the money. This is just as good as the 660 but way cheaper, don't waste your money buy the 200!Great GPS, Buy it now!!"
5,great product,"I wanted to replace my old Garmin Street Pilot. I also wanted a cheap product with useful features, but not packed with stuff I do not want or will not use.This little gps unit comes with streets of the United States. The color screen makes it easy to use. The display can be changed from a 3D, or bird's eye view of the road, to an overhead, traditional view. The scale can be adjusted with the push of the plus or minus sign. After having it for several months, I turned off the spoken part of the direction because it is just easier for me. I like to program ""favorites"" into the little machine for places I have not been to yet. Then, when you are on the road, it will guide you right to it. I purchased an AC adapter so i can sit at home and enter data, then move it to the car. The on-screen map has gotten me out of many neighborhoods when the main roads have been blocked by construction. I recommend this product and there is no need to spend more money than what this costs."
5,"Simple, Clean Interface, Excellent!","If you are looking for an easy to use, easy to see GPS with a clean interface, this is the one for you. I have used it and enjoyed it immensely for both personal and business travel."
4,Garmin Nuvi 200,"great product for price, does everything you need if you just want directions, no fancy add ons, does what you need for a great price"
5,Great product,I have this same Garmin Nuvi 200. I love it. This particular one I purchased for my daughter. She is ver happy with it.
5,simplicity,"A chimp could use this, better yet my mother could use this and she still has trouble using the remote control. i was expecting easy to use and itblew my mind it was so simple. it is my first gps though. i was not expecting it to know where i was as soon as i turned it on nor tell me every single business within a mile of me. i was dumbfounded by this system. and i think i got one of the better one's. i have heard the name garmin for years. i will not travel without it. i can find the restaurants i like and the gas stations i use in cities i am not familiar with . i don't know how i survived without it. technology is amazing. i got the best deal at [...] i had bought a digital camera there cuz they were the cheapest and the cheapest i found my garmin nuvi 200 was there too.and i got free shipping. can't beat that."
3,Cute & compact,"This cute small gps was enough to take me around California on my own. The volume was good enough as well. The only reason why I gave it 3 stars was because the dashboard mount couldn't even hold the holder, and there was an extra USB wire that couldn't even connect the gps to my computer as it was the wrong totally the wrong one. This was a used gps & it was ok. Nothing to shout about & I had to order the casing & the dashboard mount."
4,good,"It is good deal. This navigation is very good most time for used thing, but sometimes it can not locate satellite."
2,Overall ok.,The GPS as such was good. But the car charger that came along with it was a dump. Did not work and was broken. Good that I had ordered another charger which saved. Overall ok.
1,"Flawed design- if it falls off your windshield, it's done","The way the cord is routed (vertically), if the suction cup breaks loose from your windshield, it will impact the electrical input that powers the unit. Despite your best efforts to angle the plug just right and secure it with duct or gaffer tape, it will not stay powered on. Why these GPS companies designed their units this way I haven't a clue. Instead of selling more units through self destruction, they simply force customers to other brands. TomTom is more accurate, and doesn't have this inherent FAIL flaw."
2,old i would go for a newer model,This navigation come with a very old map it does not have up to date location and roads if you want that you must update it on the garmin website but it is not free it will cost you 50 dollar or more just for a update of the map. But with that you could just buy a newer model it would be alot cheaper that way. This navigation does come with very responsive touchscreen though.
3,old map,"Love ease of use, does not always use shortest route. Going took me one way, coming home took me other way. Sometimes is too slow that one goes by turn b4 voice direction kicks in."
4,Good job,"Very good interface, good navigation, but it should give you chance to update the maps after you buy it, because most of them have maps from 2006, 2007 and just now they released maps 2009"
5,love it,"money well spent, I am happy with it and it is easy to use very basic, which is perfect for my wife, great product all around."
2,GPS NUVI,"I purchased this Garmin and the maps were at least 3 years old. After using the GPS for 3 weeks, it is very hard to type the correct letters and numbers. You have to push the letter below the letter you want to get it to work. I would not recommend ordering the less expensive models online. I feel the reason they are less expensive online than in stores is that the have old maps and the stores need to get rid of the old inventory."
3,Help!!,"Ok...quess i am a little slow...i quess I am one of thoes guys that likes to read..the darn set up and go guide is useless!!!...how do i find out all the tricks to this gem??? eg memmory card what is it for??..charging batt how long???,,,how do i up date maps???,,,,see my point i can go on and on!!!,,thanks in advance to all that respond!!!"
5,Garmin nüvi 200 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator,Amazon is the best! Got this GPS for a good price and fast shipping. You get alot for the money with this GPS. Will buy another one!
4,Wow all this and small,"I love my new GPS System, it gets me where I need to be and even fits in my purse so I have it with me all the time. My cell phone offers this feature but with the price I paid at Amazon I only had to pay once and not another monthly bill. Thanks Amazon for a great product."
5,Garmin nuvi 200,This is what I wanted to send as a gift. The price was $150 less than any store in the area.
5,BEST EVER,"You can't go wrong with this. I brought this about a month ago and used it in Denver,CO. and was never lost. The price is worth it."
4,What a deal!,"Even though I bought this CD just for 1 particular song, (Do You Love Me by The Contours) I was very pleased with the overall mix of Motown hits. Original songs by the original artists, that's the only way to go! The very first song on the CD says it all, ""Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing"" As for Marvin Gaye, as good as his solo work is, I particularly enjoy his duets. I plan to add some if not all of the rest of this series to my collection. If you agree that the old Motown stuff is among the greatest music ever, you'll enjoy this CD and the others in the series. At $6.25, an excellent value."
1,Eh...,"This game is cute. And it's got some nifty challenges. And that's about it. It goes on forever, but once you've beaten the challenges, what's the point? The challenges take awhile, but only because the villagers take forever to get anything done. It's a real time game so you get no instant gratification. Just set them to a task and go away. Check back the next day to see how they're doing. It's like an electronic ant farm. Except that they kind of do what you tell them. Sometimes."
4,I've been playing this game for days!,In this game you will spend most of your playing time assigning jobs to villagers and having them breed. It is a slow game and best for spending a few minutes here and there watching over your growing village. And you can have up to 5 different games going at a time. You need to use the tech points the scientist villagers earn to buy skill upgrades so your village will thrive. (The final farming upgrade is very important to keeping your food supply up.) There are also 'puzzles' that you solve as your village advances and you help them explore. And occasionally an event will pop up and you will have to choose how your villager reacts and the result can either be very good or even deadly.I found this game to be very fun. I let my game run all day checking it every couple hours.
1,Didn't work with my xbox 360,"This may be partly my fault, but I was lead on to believe that this game would work for my xbox 360, which it does not."
3,DW4,"This product is not sold as shown and for it to be advirtised as such is crap. It comes in a plain case with no booklet, but other than that its great. The game plays great has a few scratches but what game don't."
5,Excellent!,"I cannot over emphasize the value of this book! It presents information that is critical to a healthy lifestyle. One of the most ignored elements, and one which has been responsible for many illnesses, is WATER. This book informs the reader of simple changes that can be made regarding water consumption for major health benefits. I highly recommend adding it to your library so that you can share it with the people in your life you care about. IT COULD SAVE A LIFE!"
1,Poorly Written/ Unreliable Sources,"""Unfortunately, man is more interested in the unknow darkness of outer space than studying and protecting our vast seas!"" Aside from poor grammar and unnecessary repetition, this book includes all kinds of shocking ""facts"" that are ultimately unsubstantial:According to the book, Fluoride causes ""Cancer in all it's deadly forms."" How can the author make such a statement without elaboration?! There is no source or study sited in the book, and realistically the subject is controversial. The Bragg Books are intended to shock a person into paying 8 bucks for what could have better been written by a 5th grader."
3,Oldie but a goodie,"This is a great classic about the importance of clean water. This book was way ahead of its time. Good for the average person. Though written well over 30 years ago, Paul Bragg already recognized the importance of clean water for everything from digestion to eyesight. However, the jury is out on his claims about distilled water being more important than water with natural minerals. A good easy read.Doug Setter, Bsc.Author ofStomach FlatteningandOne Less Victim: A Prevention Guide"
2,Big Disappointment!,"Please, DON'T BUY THIS ITEM. Save your money. This clothesline is not worth the money they are selling it for. It looks neat, like it is made of metal. But it is made of cheap plastic coated in silver metalic paint. The clothesline is NOT STURDY at all. And it was hard to mount it on the wall as well. My husband thought it would take 5-10 min, but he ended up installing it for at least 30 minutes."
1,Flimsy,Unlike the retractable clothes line you may have used at the hotel this product is really only adequate for light duty use. I managed to break the spring in my first one and the string in the second.
1,Even the low price is not worth it.,Cheaply made and looks cheap. Not worth even the economical price. Save yourself the trouble and go more upscale.
4,Great Part-time Clothes Line,"Got this months ago and installed in less than 10 minutes in my laundry room. It's plastic (who would expect stainless for this price?) We use for occassional line drying of things that can't go in the dryer (diapers, lingerie). Not really strong enough for everyday use for heavy stuff."
3,Picture is deceiving,"I bought this because the picture makes it look like a chrome face with a white band around the sides. That would have matched our bathroom design. It turns out that it has a chrome colored finish all over.EDIT: Don't know if it's because of my review, but the picture has now been changed. So, as Gilda Radner (playing Emily Litella) used to say - ""NEVER MIND""."
4,Dogs Love It!,"Our dogs love to eat these as ""treats."" They smell better and our yard isn't covered in burn spots anymore."
2,Disappointed,My grandparents used garlic tablets for years with wonderful results on their pets. I was hoping for the same. I have been using this product on our cats and dogs for over a month now. The cats do seem to be flea-free but the dogs are not. I was really hoping that it would work. At least their coats are shinier. Plus it is really easy to give it to them. They come running and think it is a treat!
2,Brewers Yeast Tablets,"No problems with the seller at all. The product arrived in a timely manner and as advertised.I purchased the product based on the reviews of the product. It did not work for my pet the same way as reviewed by other users. It might have helped with the coat, but it did not do anything at all for fleas (and that was the main reason I purchased it). My dog loves those tablets though."
3,anti flea remedy,"I didn't find that it really helped much with the fleas,otherwise it was okay.We ground it up and put it in our dogs food."
5,Old Time Remedy Still Works - 4 Paws,I used Bewers Yeast to keep my daughter's puppy flea free many years ago - I believe it is supposed to be thiamine in it that works - & ordered this as a gift for a friend whose pet Schnauzer was battling fleas & ticks in a rural setting. She says it seems to be working for about 2 months now. My research indicated the ticks don't like the garlic so the combo seemed to be right & it was a very inexpensive experiment.
4,"Great Product, but price hike","I love using this for my Vizsla for flea and tick prevention, but the price has gone up quite a bit since I last ordered it. It was $12 last time I ordered 1000 count, but now it's over $17! That seems a bit outrageous."
4,My dog loves it,"I have a 1 year old female Scottish,she loves the taste of this.Her coats is shinier now and fuller now (taking it for about a month)"
4,"It helps, hopefully eventually it will do the trick","It is helping, my dog is scratching less and is definitely shinier and softer but she still has a large patch of dandruff that we just cannot get rid of on her lower back. I brush her regularly, I have done everything under the sun that I can think of to do but she won't stop biting at it and it won't stop flaking. This helps though, and we've only been on it for a week or so maybe after more time we will get the full effect."
5,flea and tick prevention without the chemicals,"Awesome product. My dog was a little skeptical at first but now he gladly accepts them as treats, as well as the cat. My laborador has always had dandruff and because of his black hair it's noticeable whenever he sheds. Since using these tablets I have not only noticed a significant decrease in his shedding but his dandruff is completely gone. This is an amazing product that will not only promote your pets best health but also save you hundreds each year on pest prevention."
3,2.5 stars,"While my cats seem to like the taste, the pills have not kept away fleas as I hoped. I am now trying pure brewer's yeast in powder form, which they love the taste of--if I give them cat food without the yeast in it, they look at me like something is missing."
3,couldn't tell a difference,I got this as a supplement for skin and coat for my dogs. I couldn't tell a differenceat all in their coat or shedding.My mom used the remainder for her dogs and said it did seem to keep fleas off.
2,Didn't work on fleas,"Our dog's coat was more shiny, but these had no affect on her fleas. We gave her a higher dose than the package even recommends and they had zero effect. We ended up having to resort to chemicals once again to get rid of them."
5,Yum,"I bought this to avert fleas from my cat but I have no idea if it works. Frankly I think you need something much stronger and non-homeopathic. However, my cat LOVES these things as treats and they are supposed to be good for other things like her coat etc. I would recommend for a supplement/treat."
4,easy to give,"I will know for sure if my flea problem is gone after the warm weather arrives. My cats never go outside, they had fleas when I rescued them and one is still feral impossible to catch to put medication on her..."
4,Cats think its a treat,The animals take the pills with no problem. It was told to me that the brewers yeast would help get rid of fleas. It didn't we still have the fleas and the animals are very itchy. Eventhough it doesnt work like I was told it would I still think it is great. The cats coat is softer then it has ever been.
5,We are very happy with it,"I am using this product now for over a year and I works great. My dog is a Labrador-mix and she was pretty infested last year, and frontline didn't work and nothing else I tried worked, so I gave it a shot, after I gave her Little City Dogs Flea Killer capsules (57 mg Nitenpyram) to killed the fleas she had and after that I gave her 9 brewers yeast with garlic tablets every day (she is 90 lbs) and it worked magic. No fleas, and to my surprise not one tick she got here in Missouri. I am very happy and so is she :-)"
3,Dogs love them!,My dogs love these and their coats look great but they didn't seem to work too well for repelling fleas.
4,Great for Coat! Get rids of some fleas but not all,I bought this for my 10 year old dog and my 9 year old dog. The 10 year old coat looks like a lions mane and is more shinier and whiter! He had lots of fleas unfortunately he still has a good amount. The 9 year old was balding and amazingly her hair is growing back! I am going to buy more of these pills because their amazing! my dogs eat them up (and they are picky dogs with foods) and the pills are so CHEAP!!
2,not sure it works,dog still itches like crazy and has fleas. Not sure if she is getting new ones but either way she is the same. and has visible fleas. She does like the taste though.
4,Not a flea killer but it helps to deter,"My dogs eat these without a problem...even alone as a treat. I haven't noticed a complete removal of fleas but a reduction definitely. I am not a huge chemical fan so I will use borax or diamaceous earth for carpets, natural to pyrethrin based shampoos, and occasional IGR sprays when things get bad. I think this product does help reduce the biting on my dogs and will continue to use it."
5,Great for my pups.,"These are great for my two mixed breed dogs. It helps keep the skin and coat looking clean and shiny and helps with itching related to allergies, etc. This one is much better than the other brand on Amazon because the serving size of the other one (with husky on front) is twice as many tablets so it essentially twice as expensive. Read the labels and shop smarter not harder."
2,Different Brand Recieved than Pictured,"I ordered this due the pictured items all being Four Paws brand tablets and the description saying they where ""by Four Paws"". Today I opened the package and found a few pamphlets and flyers from 1-800-PetMeds, which I did not mind, and a dog biscuit which my dog seemed to enjoy, but not Four Paws Brewers Yeast Tablets. Instead I found NaturVet Brewers Yeast Tablets, of the same count as least, but a different ingredient list and feeding instructions reading 2 tablets per 10 pounds of body weight, whereas the Four Paws bottle I still have from my last time buying them says 1 tablet per 10 pounds. So I have something I didn't order substituted? without asking me that will last half the time."
4,Brewer's Yeast for Fleas,"We give our dogs brewer's yeast at each meal. We had switched them to an all natural flea and tick product because I was tired of dumping poison on them. I read that brewer's yeast is also good for repelling fleas, so I added that to their meals as a supplement to the all natural product. We are on our second month and so far, so good. It's less expensive than the old treatment!"
5,A must have!,"I can't believe I have gone this long without these tablets being a part of my pets' lives!I have two cats and a dog (a really picky dog). They all LOVE these. If I say ""treats"" they know they will be getting their yeast tablets.Other than the cute stuff, within two days I noticed my dog's fur was ridiculously soft. He normally has a semi-wiry coat and very sensitive skin.My cats already had soft fur but they suddenly have even more luxurious coats!I was expecting a good product but I must say I am pretty blown away by how much a little yeast tablet can do. Not to mention the affordability. I will continue to buy these!"
5,GREAT PRODUCE!!!,"These items was SUPPER CHEAP, and worked GREAT. I had checked around before ordering, couldn't bet the PRICE and it arrived on time!!!"
3,nutritional support for flea treatment,Dogs didn't like the taste but cats did. Haven't seen change yet in flea repelling. Will update after 6 weeks of treatment.
2,Fleas like garlic,"2 weeks of feeding my dog with this product and there are still fleas. Apparently fleas don't mind garlic at all. Dog seems to enjoy it, fur does become softer. Shedding control and flea repellent do not work at all. I had to use Frontline Spray instead."
1,Good to get rid of fleas BAD for Your Dog,Like many who want to stop putting poison on their dogs I wanted to try this product. It worked well for fleas not great for ticks BUT I discovered something really frighting in my research . According the ASPCA Garlic is very bad for dogs and shreds red blodd cells. Too bad I really liked this product.I am going to switch to Arc Neem Protectant spray. Good for fleas but not highly rated for ticks although it may discourage second bites. I'm gonna buy a small bottle and see how the dogs tolerate it. I know staight undiluted neem oil is too harsh on animals which is why I will try their product.
1,Fleas Love Garlic !!,"ive been using this product for the past month or so. i have 2 dogs and a cat. it does nothing for flea control. infact, in seems like they have more fleas now than before. i think the fleas love the garlic! the dogs love the taste of the chewable tabs. the dogs breath smells like garlic. i'll continue to use the product cause the dogs love the ""treat"" so much. but wont buy it again for flea control."
1,Not good for my dog :(,"I order this product hoping to help my dog with his bad odor and hair falling, well is has been about two months already and dont see any difference, he is very stinky, hair falls everywhere and also got a big rash so i dont recommend it at all"
2,no,I am not in love with the book. Too much sex. Half of the book is only about 'close relationships'. But the whole book was okay. Nothing special. Definitely will not buy 1st and 3rd books.
1,Boring,I needed this book for a class that was equally as pointless as this book. I did get an A in the class and I don't think I cracked the spine of this low quality reading material. Just use the internet.
5,Just the right mood for Christmas,"You won't find the standard Christmas carols here, except for Silent night, accompanied by a monologue where Frankie tells us what Christmas means to him. In all the tracks he finds the Christmas spirit beautifully. The tracks are well performed and superbly recorded. I am delighted this CD has been re-released."
2,Not A Lear Jet 45,It was advertised as a Lear Jet 45. It was not a 45 Model. It was an older model of Lear Jet. I needed the LJ 45 for a project.
2,a disgrace,"Some of the entries are helpful; some show their authors to be five or ten years behind the best research on their topics. John Heil's entry, for example, repeats well-known criticisms of functionalism by Ned Block (1990) as if they were novel.My main complaint, though, is the editing. It is shameful that a book that costs this much should be so full of solecisms and inaccuracies. One can't read a page without coming across a mistake, and the bibliography is almost useless with all its errors. (E.g., Rorty's article 'Putnam and the Relativist Menace' is cited as 'Philosophy and the Relativist Menace.') This would be nit-picking if there weren't so many nits to pick."
3,"Good product, bad warehouse.","Totally satisfied with the product itself, the shortfall: took 7 days to leave the warehouse. Perfect fit in 2005 tiburon, only had to remove the 2 mounting brackets (it's Hyundai universal for certain years) as the instructions said to, finish is not a perfect match to the interior texture, but color is spot on, if you can wait for the warehouse to d*ck around, it's worth it, I personally have no patience, and 3 days late was unacceptable to me, overall, looks cheaply made, but overall visible portion is minimal and looks like it came stock."
4,06 Tiburon Stereo Dash kit,"This stereo dash kit arrived broken but I was able to fix it. The packaging could have been alot better. This dash kit fits very well in my 06 Tiburon and it was easy to install the stereo on it. Good product, bad packaging."
4,good product,"This Item made the instal easy and good looking, with the exception of the rim that goes around the head unit is to fat and will not let the face fit snug."
2,The display ruins it.,"Not that the display has anything to do with the sound (which is good)...it's that even at the lowest level of brightness, it is still WAY too bright. The whole background panel is lighted. It can literally light the whole room, which is a problem if you want this near your bed.What were they thinking?"
3,Almost but not quite,"good controls, dual alarm feature is nice, excellent reception even though I live in a rural area. I purchaased the three speaker model as reports indicated this would improve sound quality. The third speaker merely cancels one of the two internal speakers and allows you to get more phsyical separation between the left and right channels. The sound quality of the speakers is unacceptable, tinny, poor range, sounds like a cheap tabletop radio. The good news is you can connect external speakers, I purchased a set of Kipsch 2.1 and the sound and feautres are now excellend. Of course that adds another 150.00 to get an adequate device. If the speakers were improved, it would definitelg earn five stars."
3,Beware: Not compatible with 3rd gen 10/15/20 GB iPods,"This was bought for me as a gift (not from amazon, though, but Apple). However, advertising both here and on Apple's website claim that this product is compatible with the 3rd generation iPod (not talking about the iPod nano, but the 10/15/20GB one that came out in 2003).It isn't. Calls to iHome's customer service department only confirmed this. In fact, I was told that the only iHome product that is compatible with the 3rd gen iPod is the iH5 alarm clock radio.Otherwise, it's a fine system and I thought the sound was pretty good."
3,"Good information, bad translation and organization","Firstly, it's not really a history of European folk music. It's more of a survey. That said, there's a lot of great information, including historic and more recent research in ethnomusicology. I enjoyed the book and found it very useful. Two caveats: the organization of the book is rather unhelpful, and the translation can be quite awkward."
4,Good general discussion on case preparation,"If you think of this book as your preparation for case interview of consulting firms, you are reading the wrong book.This book is about preparing for case discussion for undergrad and graduate business courses. It provides general tips and strategies for: - forming study group - reading the case efficiently and effectively - analysing the case - participating and presenting in class your insight (your discussion role and course strategy) - classroom strategics and tactics (including where you sit)As a Harvard MBA student, I found this book (written by an Harvard MBA alumnus) relevant. It doesn't provide specific points to cover in particular class - it does have some general discussion on key accounting, finance, and marketing concepts in order to crack these cases. After all, it's a book about case analysis, not about accounting, finance nor marketing...."
1,Abysmal!,"As a soon-to-graduate Kellogg student, I thought this text might give me better insight into the case interviews that the management consulting firms use while recruiting. I was disappointed to find that this book provides only a few pages on case analysis; the remainder of the book is devoted to such topics as ""seat visibility in the case classroom"". If Dickens, dead drunk, were to try to write a very dry overview of the case method in a classroom setting, he might pen this text on a very bad day. Save your money and go to VaultReports.COM or WeetFeet instead...."
4,a great series of books,"I love this series of books. The book is small but full of insight and thoughtful,helpful examples of somewhat common situations with a 3 year old. What I really like about all of these books (understanding your 1 yr old,...2 yr old...) is that there is a great deal of respect given to the child as well as the parent, which somehow strikes me as different from many other books for parenting. I hope that I can find all the proceeding years of books in this series as my son gets older. I would love to own a whole series someday. This would be a great gift for new parents, exp the 1 yr old edition."
1,AVOID THIS SELLER !,"BEWARE:This company lists items that they do not have in stock! I bought several parts from this company, and after billing my credit card, they shipped only half of my order, then refunded only a portion of what was suppose to be refunded to me! I had to get Amazon and Paypal involved in the resolution. AVOID THIS BAD SELLER! Avoid wasting your time resolving issues with them. Terrible follow up email from them as well! They have the same problems over at E-Bay they are listed under several different names!"
5,awesome shoes,I got these shoes from Amazon. They were way cheaper getting them from Amazon than in store at strite rite shoes. These shoes are wonderful. They are so comfy and my son loves them.
2,bought used,came in real bad shape someone wrote in it and pages were all messed up the reading part was still there wont buy used again
2,Fun for a while,"We liked the spoon until the moisture affected the batteries, causing it to malfunction."
1,Not Happy,"There is not a lot of good I can say about this product. It fell apart the second I took it out of the box. Was still somewhat usable, but not worth the cost."
3,Worth a try,"This ""kit"" was something I thought we could try. We have tested both of the flavors, and the toys. I like the 'tongue' action, and the husband is fond of the cherry flavored lick me licker."
4,FUN TIMES,THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR COUPLES WHO ARE JUST STARTING THEIR TOY COLLECTION. PLAYFUL COUPLES WILL ENJOY THIS BOX O' FUN.
1,Not a recommended book for students.,"I find this book quite difficult to follow. The mathematical derivation is too tedious to follow. Standard symbols are not the same found in other books, which adds to the difficulties in concentrating on the concepts the author is trying to convey. Furhtermore, you'd have to flip and back forth to understand what the symbols represent, because the author does not reiterate what they are. Bottom line: too much math CRAP!! and not enough verbal explanations. Don't be surprise if you find yourself falling asleep while reading the book."
2,Outdated,"I found this book to be useful for students who are trying to get started with IC design but less useful to the practicing engineer. The Circuits discussed in the book are old and some are not practical to implement in today's IC processes. The Book also fairly touches on simulation using SPICE level 3 models which is very outdated, most IC Designs use BSIM3 as an industry standard. I should also mention the book's strongest section is the one that covers OPAMP compensation, this particular subject is well treated in this book."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,This Book is excellent. It would be still nice if books main objective is on cmos circuit.Everyone who wants to enter into analog design must read and refer to this.
1,The Music samples are all wrong...,"... and in fact they're from some other, early 20th Century New Orleanian universe, one that doesn't contain Bobby Hutcherson, sadly, and, furthermore, not a single vibraphone note can be heard on any of these cuts, let alone a marimba..................This is of course a review of the samples, and not of this album, by one of the unheralded giants of jazz music to which, sadly, I won't be exposed.I'm only doing this to raise Amazon's attention through this method, as I've already tried other methods, all to no avail."
4,"Yeah, it's cheesy, but...","The production values are crummy and Greg Smithey is flat-out embarrassing. That said -- I really enjoy the workout. It's enough to get my heart rate up and make me sweat a bit. The steps are not at all complicated, which is important when you're as uncoordinated as I am. And I must admit laughing at Greg is all part of the fun."
1,"Too ""cheesy"" for my taste!","Where to start? The video quality is poor and so is the stage complete with fake palm trees. Greg Smithey, the instructor, is so ingenuine with comments like ""you are so beautiful"" peppered throughout -- and I agree with the viewer below -- he chats non-stop. The exercises were simple but not effective enough to get one's heart rate up. It is more suited to the senior exerciser with a limited range of movement, than a healthy person. Save your money!"
2,Noisy Zurich Automatic Watch Winder,The Zurich Time Single Automatic Watch Winder keeps my watch wound but its motor is very noisy. I cannot keep it in my bedroom or it keeps me awake. This is not a quiet winder!
5,The Story of One Day,"D-Day has become the most important battle of World War II in the minds of many of todays Western Citizens. It insured that the Western allies would do their full part in destroying Hitler's Germany. This is the most detailed book I have found about this day. It is arranged like an encyclopedia, with every subject covered just like subjects are covered in the World Book. This has advantages and disadvantages. If you Know exactly what topic you want, you just look it up. If you do not know what exact topic you need to look up, you will have to browse thru the book. Still- the best single book about D-Day."
1,Don't hold your breath,"The first installment had such potential, yet it was worthless. Hopefully Titus has learned something in the last few years. This is TopGun, give it a story, polish the graphics, work on the physics (hitting afterburner does not instantly accelerate you from 300 knots to 1000 knots), and if you're going to put un-lockables in this one, make them un-lockable. (has anyone unlocked the Harrier from the first game without having to use the cheat code? Thought not.)"
2,not as good as you would think,it is nothing but a green sign with stickers on it you would have better luck making one yourself it would probably turn out better some of the letters have air bubbles under them not worth the money
2,Pink Floyd Animals Tshirt,"I recently purchased this shirt. The design is really great, but when I washed it (even in cold water), the shirt shrank horribly. If you are a medium size, order the large."
1,Good for eagles,"I found the numbers so small it gave me a headache trying to decipher them.This game would be good for eagles,though, since, if they were able to read,could do so from about 50 yards."
2,the game of Sudoku,The game of Sudoku is hard for someone starting out and this version is difficult to figure out at first. After a while you get the hang of it. However it does cause problem when you have a number in the wrong spot.
1,shawmut,"same as the other 1 star reviews. if you have not used Brain Age you might think it is ok, if you have, forget it!"
1,Try Brain Age or Sudoku Mania,"I agree with the other people who gave this one poor marks. The game does not make good use of the dual screens at all. And sudoku is all thisgame does.I was spoiled because the first sudoku game I bought for DS was BrainAge - please note that sudoku is only a part of the Brain Age software,sort of a ""bonus"". Anyway, they designed it so you turn the DS 180 degrees and hold it like a book - the sudoku grid is nice and large, andfills most of one screen. The grid navigation and number entry system are very intuitive. The only issue is there are a set number of puzzles.I wish the designers of Brain Age would put out a dedicated sudoku game with the same interface, but one that generates new puzzles.I'd stay away from Gridmaster. Another option is Sudoku Mania, which is better and less expensive."
1,Sudoku Gridiaster,I started Sudoku on the Brain Age Game. I find the Gridmaster to have a poor and incomplete interface (4 temporaries only) and tiny font. Why it didn't follow the Brain Age system is beyond me. Under no circumstance can I recommend this game. Buy Brain Age and wait for a better Sudoku Game. Earl
2,"No Good, Just Buy Brain Age","I bought this game after falling in love with Sudoku through Brain Age. However, after playing a few of the maps, dealing with the annoying music and cumbersome interface, I gave up.If you haven't played Brain Age Sudoku, then maybe you won't have the same problems I did. If you have played Brain Age and are looking for more Sudoku, don't buy this game. Go buy a book or play on a website. This game will just frustrate you.The system for adding in numbers has way too many steps to it. You have to tap a number pad to add in a number, instead of just writing the number into the pad. If you use the ""helper"" numbers, you have to select which of the four sections of a box you want to add the helper number to, then tap the number pad you want to add and then tap the full box button to get back to adding in the actual number. It's too cumbersome of a system."
1,Do not buy this period,"I don't often review products, but this is a disaster.If you want to spend many nights trying to get this to work correctly to no avail, then this is for you.Thank heavens I backed up my Outlook data. This not only didn't work but scrambled my Outlook contacts.Product support is a joke.Too bad. They have a great product idea but horrible software.A product that runs circles around this is VCOrganizer Pro."
3,Learning PHP,"The book seems to do an OK job of getting the major points across, but I would have liked to see a clearer progression of information with a separate section for a quick reference. I like the CD with the code available to use. That is a valuable asset for the book."
3,NOT the best book for beginners,"The author Andy Harris comes across as a very nice guy in this book and he really is trying hard to think on a beginner level, but this book simply is not designed for someone with no programming experience. I have gone through many PHP books (as well as other programming language books) labeled ""beginner"" and it seems that none are able to truly grasp what a newbie to programming is going through. I ran into several errors in the book and, alas, there is no accompanament website that lists errata. NEVER purchase a book that does not have a frequently updated accopanying website.There are some good things that you can pick up from this book, but if you rely on it for your sole introduction to PHP than you will go insane. I recommend finding a programming mentor -either in real life or online- and searching for peices of the puzzle on the internet. A great place to start is simply www.PHP.net."
2,Not as good as it seems,"Firstly, there are no clarifications for Mac OS X users (who have the advantage of having Apache already installed).Secondly, I was told in a PHP forum that the code in this book is outdated, thus the reason why I can't get any of them to work. Mind you, when I copy and paste coding from online sources, they work fine; So I know my PHP is working. the code is bad.Finally, while I enjoy reading from a book better than from screen, I have found the tutorials at http://devzone.zend.com/node/view/id/627infinitely more helpful. Their code has comments telling you exactly what each segment of it does. Their pace and progression is better.My advice would be to make sure that the book you want to buy was written recently, and not an updated version of an older book. Look for books that the code is prominent and well explained. But online tutorials abound."
3,Knives rust,"I have never, ever, ever put these knives in the dishwasher. Yet shortly after purchasing them I noticed small rust spots. I stepped up my vigilence in hand washing and drying them and it didn't help. Some of the more used ones are horribly rusted. I don't know if it's the stainless steel or the quality of the brand or what but I'm super disappointed and will probably not buy KitchenAid knives again."
3,Great but they rust,"I guess I should have read all of the information that came with the knives and I would have known. I received these as a gift and I love....make that ""loved"" them. They are attractive, they cut well but they rust when washed in the dishwasher.If you wash them each time by hand and put them away, you will be fine. If you are lazy like me and depend on the dishwasher, they will rust."
3,Good but not great,"Maybe I was expecting too much, but these lights are only marginally brighter and whiter than the OEM bulb on my 2001 Lexus ES300. I replaced just one at first to see if I could notice a side-by-side difference. The bulbs may be a good replacement for burned out bulbs, but it probably doesn't make sense to replace bulbs that are currently OK."
2,A waste of money!,"I really don't notice any big difference between the stock bulbs and the SilverStars. Yeah, they shine good but not what I expected. Not worth the money. I do give credit to Sylvania's marketing dept. Even after reading all and I mean ALL reviews, I had to find out for myself. The hard way. Save your money. When these bulbs burn out, I will re-install the factory halogens."
3,not too much difference...,"Bought this bulbs thinking it was a good chance to improve the stock ones. Well, there was a minor improve but think the stock ones perform similar so maybe it was not the best decision.My car is Forester XT 2006."
1,Used for Corolla,"HI, i brought this set of lights to use for my 2009 Toy Corolla. The bulbs burned out in just 4 months, i cant believe this. The lights that came with the car burnt out after 3 years.I think these are BAD.."
5,Very happy with the bulbs,"Let's face it, the stock lights on my honda were just not cutting it. If you driven through Pennsylvania's back roads you will know what I mean. This is my second try at bulbs for my car. The first failed miserably as the bulbs burnt out ofter 6 months. These bulbs provide a very nice and strong white light. So far they are holding up quite well. Important note: Always where gloves when you install these bulbs to prevent oil and smudges."
3,Some improvement - not sure it's worth the money,I installed these replace my brights on my 07 Camry. I do a lot of night driving in rural PA deer country. I saw a slight improvement but not what Sylvania claims. My brights were pretty good to begin with - only minimal improvement. Nice white light but light really doesnt project further than my old bulbs. I don't think it is worth the money for later- model cars When installing use gloves and don't touch the bulb. I have had no problem with longevity.
3,Bright white... 6 month lifespan,"I like the color temperature of these bulbs, it is a nice white light without being an annoyance to other drivers like some bulbs are.However, as others have stated, they do not last very long. I've gone through 3 sets, and not one set has lasted more than 6 months. I've always grabbed the light by the plastic base and not the bulb itself, but that doesn't make a difference, the filament just goes.Oddly, I've never kept the receipt to take advantage of Sylvania's lifespan warranty, but this time... this time I mean it.... I will keep the receipt."
2,doesn't last,"Bought the silverstar headlights for the same reason as others. Paid $40 for a pair. One of them went out at 10 months. Luckily kept the packaging and receipt. The packaging states ""satisfaction guarantee for 12 months"". I emailed Sylvania and they said they are willing to send me a new bulb. But they also stated that since the bulb burns brighter than most bulbs the product life is decreased.Will most likely not buy these types of bulbs again. Kind of ridiculous to pay $40 a year for headlights when cheaper (and just as good) ones last much longer."
3,So So,"Low beams do not fit my wife's 2011 Toyota as advertised to. The base is not only not close there appears to be no way to make it fit. Oh well, live and learn..."
1,Buyer beware - terrible durability,"These bulbs are better than average in terms illumination, but won't last more than 6 months if you're lucky. I kept giving Slyvania chances and have bought several iterations of their SilverStar bulbs, but they have all failed anywhere from 1-6 months after purchase."
1,Not worth it.,"Wasn't even brighter than my stock ones.Go for the Philips ultrabright bulbs, they actually have a white/blue tint and cost less than $25!"
4,Doesn't Change Day Time Running Lights Color,"The quality and color of these bulbs are great when you have your highbeams on, but they do not change the color of the daytime running lights, which is why I purchased them."
1,beware ..will not fit car!!!,Used the product index to match bulbs with car . Did not fit!!!!!!!!!!..now I am stuck paying return postage.Thanks Amazon for the bad service!
3,Sylvania 9005SU BP TWIN Silverstar Ultra not white enough,I was disappointed at the color temperature of this product as it is still very yellowish compared to my HID Xenon low beam. Otherwise it is quite easy to swap with my OEM bulbs.
1,I am not happy at all...,"Well, I bought this just over a year ago..... I did not install right away and when I did install I was very careful not to handle the bulb at all with my fingers. Still, after just about a year one headlight has gone out already.. I have not been able to find a warranty so I doubt there is one. Still I would really think a headlight would last longer than 1 year especially when a paid cost $60...I was happy with the nice bright white light but there is no way I am going to pay $60 again for headlight that is going to last a year... Ofcourse I live in NewEngland(CT) and it is freezing cold outside and I really do not feel like replacing a headlight.. A waste of $60..."
5,It's working!,"I recieved my order in perfect condition. Installed them using a gloves as recommended.Will see how long they last :)[UPDATE] July 22, 2010.Still working perfectly."
5,They work greate,My lights work good I will be getting high and low for my wife's charger And when I need new ones for my truck I will use nothing but Sylvania SilverStar Ultra
5,Great Bulbs,"Good quality, very bright, decent output. I use this in my fogs and high beams on my Accord and output is awesome."
5,sylvania high beab bulbs,"this is a great product, I could really tell a difference when I compared the two by doing one at a time. Just make sure you dont break any tabs off of your headlight cover when trying to install them. I would highly suggest this to anyone looking to upgrade their high beam lights."
1,sylvania 9005su silverstar -SAVE YOUR $$$,I BOUGHT THIS HEADLIGHTS IN FEB. 2009 IT IS NOW DEC 1ST 2009 AND THE BULBS ARE BURNED OUT!! (9 MONTHS IS WAY TO EARLY FOR THESE HIGH- END LIGHTS TO GO BAD. (NO I DID NOT LEAVE MY LIGHTS ON)
3,Didn't meet my expectations!,"Not that much better than what came on the Chevy Silverado, sorry. Hope they prove e wrong but so far keep your standard equipment headlights"
3,bulbchanger,"these silverstar ultra are not worth the $49.99 list price for the twin pack. they will burn out in less than a year, mine lasted 10 months cause I only use them about two weeks per month. They are really not that much brighter than regular new head lights. they are just a whiter light which makes reflective road signs show up better. Also you will not get any rebate from Sylvania if you shop around and get a better price or get them on sale."
4,Better Lighting,"I have used Silverstars (and now Silverstar Ultras) in all of our family's vehicles. We live in the country where roads can be very dark and deer and other critters crouch on the roadside waiting to run out. They provide a level of lighting improvement that has to be seen to appreciate. Vision is so much better and eye strain greatly lessened. They do not blind oncoming drivers when properly aimed either. My one negative is that they are not cheap and the increased output seems to come at the expense of longevity. The Ultras are said to last longer than the original Silverstars but only time will tell. Besides, all halogen bulbs lose lumens (brightness) over time so headlight bulbs should be replaced periodically anyhow. Install Silverstar Ultras, polish those lenses if they're fogging and be prepared to be impressed...good lighting is indespensible."
3,These are for the hi-beams,Make sure you realize that these are not for the regular headlights but for the High beams.
3,ok,"When I first installed these lights, I was quite disappointed in both the claimed extra whiteness and the claimed extra brightness. I complained to Sylvania, and they were good about standing behind them to satisfy me. After using them awhile, I do now see a difference in brightness and in color. So, while they still aren't as I'd expected them to be, they are better than my initial first impression. The package does warn that these don't last as long as regular bulbs."
5,LOVE THEM!,GREAT PRODUCT! AWESOME! VISIBILITY IS OPTIMAL! BEST I'VE EVER SEEN AT NIGHT!GREAT PRODUCT!(Don't touch the bulbs they burn out within 3 months if you do!)
2,Great Lights... Before they Burn Out,"I've gone through three packs of Sylvania headlights. I'm guessing they are getting all the great reviews because people haven't had them longer than a year, but I think once they get around a year of use, they'll find they start burning out. Bright lights... but I keep having to change them out. A total waste of money."
4,Does not fit Toyota Camry,"I really wanted to install Pure Bright White Halogen Light Bulbs for my Camry 2009 as the reviews were impressive! But sadly, these don't fit in my Car!Only H11's will fit which come in High Performance types only and Sylvania doesn't make Ultra High Performance Headlamps for Camry, that was really sadLoved the product and I wish it could be installed!"
1,Don't expect them to last long,"Purchased these SilverStar Ultra headlights approx. 10 months ago, the first one died after 7 months, and tonight the other one died. They are nice and bright, just get your wallet ready again soon."
1,POOR PRODUCT,"These lights are no brighter than those that came in my Acura, and burn out much faster.Poor choice on my part."
3,Description not specific enough,"This light was purchased for a 2006 Nissan Altima. The description did not state whether it was for high beam or low beam. (It is for High beam). Unfortunatly, I bought this for my husband and he was after the low beam. We sent it back without any problems.It would have saved the headache and shipping cost of returning it, if the description had stated this fact.Note: The description on the package does not state this fact either)"
1,Unhappy,"I ordered this video thinking it would be a video dvd, but it was a audio dvd. I could hear the words but no picture. Kind of hard to learn guitar with no pictures..."
3,You're probably an old geezer if...,"1. Very slow delivery by USPS ""because it is a book""2. Only mildly funny; it assumes all geezers are male."
4,There are no reviews for this yet?,"If you're even looking at the Cabaret Voltaire offerings [on the site], for whatever reason (Fischerspooner got compared to them, you were researching the dada movement, customers who bought Nine Inch Nails also bought this CD, et alia), you need this CD in your collection. These boys were the genesis of the sound that legions of followers would mutate into a myriad of directions that you know and love -- techno, industrial, breakbeat, goth -- and this album will take you to amazing places. Play it in the dark, or set your television between channels and watch the static with ""Mix-Up"" in the background. Have kinky jaded ... and put this on repeat on your CD player. Paint your windows and appliances matte black or sickly green and blare this as your soundtrack.Given 4 stars only because this band would surpass this effort with ""Red Mecca"". You should have that one too, but one step at a time if you're not among the industrial Illuminati."
1,MS,"I am diappointed with your service as I can not order thing direct to my address at Saudi Arabia, I have order this item to my friend in America and she will ship it to my address. please send me the way I can order thing directly to my address at Saudi Arabia.Muna Anani"
5,Can't believe how much they ROCK,"Wow, this album is the coolest. If you haven't heard Crawling In THe Dark yet, you don't know what you're missing. The other songs rock as well. I saw them life with my #1 favorite band Linkin Park, and I was dazled. If you are sitll waiting to buy this album, stop and go buy it. All the songs are either 9 or 10 in my book."
3,Crawling in the dark for a reason,"I got this album for christmas last year after hearing ""Crawling In The Dark."" Although it was a good song there was a lot more depth in the self-titled album. I thought the best song talently and vocally was ""Up and Gone."" Although I did enjoy listening to this album I must tell you that it all starts to sound the same after a while. Song after song the same bass and guitar cord progressions. Overall the album is acceptable but i wouldn't go writing home about it."
5,Hooba Sweet,"This awsome cd includes some of their best songs ""Crawling in the Dark"" and ""Hello Again"". Buy this cd and you will have your dreams come true, if you havn't got it yet then quickly buy it."
4,One of the Best DRIVING Albums of Recent,4 stars here was WAY overrated say 3-4 months agobut as soon as I put it on in my car on a long road trip I got into the musicit is actually a really good album but listen to it while driving on a long trip or something similar 'cause at least I really couldn't stand it much while listening to it back home on my stereo
4,"Not very original, but it rocks all the same.``","Hoobastank are definately trying too hard to be like Incubus here. So much so they're even supporting them on their europe tour! All the same this album still really sparkles amongst a lot of the junk that is on the market right now. I actually own another Hoobastank album called Basketball Shorts, which is very rare, and I actually think it's better due to the more jazz influence on some of the songs which really makes it stand out. Overall it's definately worth getting your money out for this album/"
1,why,"this is like the 80's with cheesey hair bands.they all sound the same.everyone on the radio now is just boring.You think it would be hard to be boring for these guys with a stupid name like hoobastank but guess what,they pulled it off.They are part of what corporate america likes to call this ""rock surge"" which is just hype in order to make money.Anyway can someone original get played on the radio.why must we listen to this.god help us all."
3,simply amazing....,or so i thought 4 years ago. if i could describe this cd in one word i would describe it as energetic. all the songs are fast paced sound and they all seem to sound the same. which isnt a bad thing but it can get boring. i would like to hear some guitar solos or drum solos on this cd but its the new millenium and most new bands stay away from that and try to make there own sound. and thats what i believe hoobastank are trying todo. instead of sounding like other bands (except for incubus.) i liked incubus a long time before hoobastank came out and when they first released this cd i heard no comparison. i was just blown away on how fresh it sounded. if your a hoobastank fan id buy this but if your not stay clearly away from this cd or burn it.
4,Incubus?,"Like Incubus? Hoobastank is the band for you. This band is so much like Incubus in fact, that if hoobastank were to release an album with incubus' name...I would be fooled. Could there be some sort of mass conspiracy? Possibly. Who really cares though. Great music is the purpose.(p.s. I only gave it 4 stars cuz I don't like giving perfect scores)"
4,good cd,"This Is a good cd,lots of people say the main singer sounds like brandon from incubus but I disagree I've heard both bands and they sound nothing alike.But that doesn't mean if you like incubus you wont like Hoobastank they both are really good bands.This Cd is one of my favorites its a little softer than what i normally listen tobut its still a really good cd.I'm sure you have probaly heard them before just listen to a rock radio station and you will more than likely hear "" Crawling in the Dark"" which is a pretty good song but there are others on the Cd that our much better such as ""Remember Me"",""Running Away"",""Let You Know"",""Up And Gone""..and many more so check it out."
4,Bizzarro,"Hoobastank is what Incubus's follow-up album to S.C.I.E.N.C.E. should have been. But instead Incubus catered to the TRL audience (who can blame them, they just want girls) Notice I didn't say ""sell-out"" - thats used way too much now - I dont think hardly anyone really knows the true meaning anymore. Also, what's with the vocalists Robb and Brandon sounding and looking the same? Is Hoobastank the Incubus from some bizzarro world? Hmmmm..."
1,Sounds just like new Incubus,"I originally gave them 3 stars. I have to change my review because after listening a little more I realized these guys really [need help]. They sould like a carbon copy of newer Incubus (Minus the intelligence and ingenuity, of course). Which, for me, isn't really a good thing because I'm a big fan of old Incubus. Their new stuff doesn't impress me much."
1,Give me a break,"Considering the fact that there are those who call Hoobastank Incubus rip-offs, let me just start off by saying that neither band started any kind of alternative rock movement or can hold a candle to those bands that did. Hoobastank's self-titled debut album sounds like rehash material from a Backstreet Boys/Incubus colaboration and is nothing more and nothing less. Typical, predictable, and just plain lame lyrics play on to the sound of downtuned nu-metal guitars; this is nothing new at all. You want to listen to real alternative rock or hard rock? Go check out Corrosion of Conformity, Soundgarden, or Faith No More and you'll see how it's really done. This is best used as a drink coaster."
1,Incubus Jr.,"In case you believed that Incubus had breached all heretofore known barriers of self-absorbed pity and misplaced angst, think again. Although Hoobastank aspires to the same nu-metal fusion that began with a gangsta-rap edge in Limp Bizkit and softened to introspective self-doubt in Incubus, this self-titled album reaches unbearable levels of syrupy whining. Hoobastank fans, please do us all a favor and stop mistaking this wretched lack of perspective for meaningful sensitivity."
2,Not really worth it,"this cd really wasnt all that good. Ill admit, i bought it because i had heard crawling in the dark on the radio and thought it was really good and was expecting more of the same on the cd. what i got was a half-rate incubus clone. i like incubus, but this cd wasnt good. i give it two stars only because crawling in the dark was a good song."
2,"Yada Yada... repetitive cliche' ""rock"" music.","The only song I really liked was ""Running Away"". And yes, I listened to the whole album.People, this is as repetitive as music can get. These guys are a boy band with guitars and drums.People keep comparing this band to Incubus, but there is just no contest. Incubus does what they do VERY GOOD. Hoobastank does what they do BAD.If you want to listen to repetitive radio-friendly music than I suggest you go buy this CD. Otherwise, go pick up something worth your time like Incubus' Morning View."
3,rock on,"Its fresh, lively, and happy. Rock and roll for today's youth. For you old folks, this is today's equivalent to Loverboy.Not overly sophisticated but not simplified. No solos. No 7 strings. No funk and no frills. Unpretentious and unflamboyant. I'm a relatively newcomer to Incubus as well (like em too)... and Hoobastank doesn't sound like Incubus. Hoobastank (at least this album) is to Stanford University as Incubus is to Berkeley. California style. peace and loveism.Good melodies. snappy songs. Heroic, youthful voice to celebrate a sunny day. rock on"
4,awesome,"this cd is one of my favorites... i've listened to it countless times and i'm still not sick of anything about it... i only gave it 4 stars though, because there are two songs i'm not too fond of... first of, track 4, ""pieces""... the whole yelling thing doesn't do it for me... i like the chorus to it, though... secondly, track 7, ""ready for you,"" is a great song, but the guitar part on the verse is too ""punkish"" for me... everything else about the cd is awesome, though... definitely buy it!!"
3,give them a chance...,"obviously this band has talent. all i've heard about the band is that they sound like incubus. how? they don't have a dj and to me, the style seems to be a just a little different. after all, this is their first album. don't a lot of bands hmmm, whats the word.....change after the first album. these guys have potential and i feel they're going to use it well."
4,The Person Who Reviewed This Should Be Fired,"It's not that I'm angry that he doesn't like Hoobastank, it's that he lacks professionalism. You don't rip an album to shreads -- you list good and both bad things and let the reader decide whether or not it's worth the purchase -- especially for a debut CD, you moron. Get a new job. This album is a colossal major debut with strong vocals and simple music to back it up -- simplicity can be good -- why should you have to go all out and technical when you can produce something just as great [if not greater] by keeping it minimal? Hoobastank is one of those bands that proves it. See them live when you can, they will make you respect them even more."
2,"""Crawling in the Dark"" is the only good song","This CD I listened to recently is similar to other bands, like Incubis. The songs all sound similar and all have the same rythm and beat to them. The only reason to get this CD is for ""Crawling in the Dark"". And perhaps ""Runnung Away"" This is a CD I would not buy. NU METAL ...!!! this cd gets worse and worse every time i listened to it, so...i used the CD for a nice frisbyif your still into this music get a clue and listen to good stuff.look at my listamanias"
4,Incubus With a New Name,"Don't get me wrong I like Incubus to a certain extent, but I was hoping Hoobastank would be different. When I first heard ""Crawling in the Dark"" I instantly liked Hoobastank, with their nu-metal approach. When I bought the CD though I found out the rest of the songs sound like they are done by a different artist. But to make myself clear, they are still another band then Incubus, so if you don't hate them to a great extent then Hoobastank is a good CD for you. Also it seems to me that if you like the Lost Prophets you will like Hoobastank and the other way around. My advice is if you are looking to buy the Hoobastank CD, don't. Find a friend who has a CD burner and a internet connection. But don't tell the record companies."
2,Nothing Special,"This album is nothing special, nobody will remember it in 10 years. Buy an Incubus album instead, it sounds like they are Hoobastank's main influence. Only they're not as good. Sounds like MTV geared music to me."
2,Booooring~~~,"""crawling in the dark"" ""running away"" was the best, ""pieces"" was ok, but the rest sound all the same, it drove me to sleep right away."
2,Bland-nothing like incubus,"Incubus is actually decent. This is bland. If you listen to songs like running away, remeber me, crawling in the dark, give it back, etc you realize how bland it is. I wish I was at their record company that day, to reject them."
5,"Better then ""The Reason""","I heard Hoobastank on MTV and liked them so I bought The Reason.All the songs were exept Out of Control which was the one I heard wern't like it. But I liked the other ones anyway and Bought this one. It is so much better, it acctually is a mix of Rock, metal, and Alternitive. Not those songs like The Reason and Unnefected. If you head one of their Rock songs and liked it get this CD and burn the song you heard[ if it was on the reason ] on the internet."
5,Editoral review written by a biased idiot,"The editoral review was written by a biased idiot. I absolutely love this CD and this group and I have been listening to music for decades. What a music review should be is objective and make the reader interested or not in trying the music themselves to see what they think about it. The review written by the Amazon editor was an opinion piece, not a review.All of the other reviews I have read on this website against Hoobastank are just as worthless."
5,Worth Listening,Well! Well! One of the best new era albums i've ever heard.Wonderful to listen to time and time again.ANACRONIC ALBUM
3,Hoobastank!,"Its a pretty good album! Its not something I listen to all the time but occassionaly I find myself wanting to hear them. To me they dont have their own thing going,.....wanting to be a little like Incubus at times but thats okay. ""Crawling in the Dark"" is a great song though and I also enjoyed ""Remember Me."" But towards the end of the cd it loses its umpgh and drags on. Not a cd you can listen to all the way through in one sitting. But still good!"
2,INCUBUS RIP-OFF'S!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"- Any die-hard music fans, especially honest Incubus fans would know the minute after watching the ""Crawling in the dark"" music video, or listening to the whole cd, or even just loking at some of the promo band pictures...that HOOBASTANK are totally Incubus Rip Offs. Yes...i admit they have talent in the musical area, and its a pretty good cd, in fact its almost excellent ( sumtimes its a little hard to remember that I'm not listening to Incubus)...but not their own style. Just a little advice to the group... "" GET YOU'RE OWN STYLE< DON'T COPY SOME ONE ELSES' !!!!!"" The cd is ok....that is if you can stand to listen to some one rip of style off one of the greatest bands to ever hit the recording booth. Buy it if you're a cd collecter...I didn't even buy it, I coppied it...I saved myself some money, that's all I'm going to say."
1,HOOBASTINK,HOOBA WHO???????.Who are these clowns.These guys are just another boy band with guitars with lame pathetic music which they called rock.For real rock music please get FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK from AC/DC or ACE OF SPADES from MOTORHEAD instead.
2,"Now really, people...","I wouldn't go so far as to call this band bad, as they're competent musicians and have a decent sense of melody. But could they be any more ordinary? And more to the point, isn't there enough of this stuff infesting the airwaves? This band has some talent, but some originality and ambition to go with it would be nice. Until then, just call them ""Incubus Jr."""
2,An unoriginal CD by an unoriginal band,"To all you Hoobastank fans, I'm sorry, and to all the Incubus fans, I'm even more sorry. This is a good opening effort by a band that tries way too hard, and comes off sounding like the Incubus knockoff that they are. With [cruddy] lyrics that occupy even [cruddier] songs (""You act like I owe you something/I don't owe anyone anything but me""), this CD finds itself at the bottom of my CD pile. The few good songs on this album are the ones that are keeping the rating to two stars rather than zero. This being said, it is evident that this album effort was a good try, and the next one will hopefully be much better."
1,horrible!!,ok first of all...these guys need to get their own sound and stop ripping of Incubus!! they [stink]....dont waste your time or money on this cd...enough said.
1,HOOB-A-STINK,"Hmmmmm, well.........Don't waste your time or money on this band. I can't think of anything good about this band at all."
3,"Pretty cool, not awesome","This CD is pretty rockin. My favorite track on it is ""Remember Me."" The songs are cool and catchy, but they all sound the same. Which is understandable, because each band has their own styl and obviously everything they do is going to be in that style, but it's not an album that I like to listen to very often. Take it for what it is and you'll enjoy it."
4,Hooba-SOUNDS!!,"Calabasis! WOW! This is one great album. There really seems to be a strong music scene coming from the Valley¡KI¡m actually really excited to see what will come next. Incubus really set a standard, and Hoobastank is doing a great job picking it up from there. Well, this album is a keeper, everyone has heard the single¡s¡Kbut I think what really makes the album is the rest of the tracks. They actually go really well with each other, this is truly a good album overall. The thing about Hoobastanks music is that it doesn¡t grow old..at least it takes a while. It¡s good, innocent, fun rock. I¡m glad I got the album."
5,Great savings on Pick up Truck repair parts,This is thee best place to buy your replacement parts.I saved 40% buying it here opposed to going to the auto part store.Great quality part. OEM Specs.Bolted right on and operattes perfectly.I will buy here again.
3,could've been better,"i like cars and racing. burnout, ridge racer, most wanted and underground series are ones of my favorites, but this one frustrates me. you can't get too aggressive on this game, and no special features, just plain slow racing. it got old too early. i suggest you rent first. graphics are nice though and cars are cool, but i'll pass on this one."
4,amd44,"As a teacher assistant and Sunday school teacher, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I read this book to my seven and 8-year-old Sunday school class and they really enjoyed the pictures and the message given. I live in North Carolina not to far from where the sit-ins took place and it's nice to be able to read about something that has happen within your community and the positive outcome that happened.The book was very well written by Carol Weatherford not so much that only an older child could read it but I felt that even a younger child could understand the language with guidance.This book has been added to my collection for Black History month."
2,"It's Not, ""All That.""","When I received this deck, right from the start, I was not very impressed. Yes, the art work is wonderful, but that's about it. I get no energy from this deck, and it's one I haven't even used yet. I may use it in the future. Save your money, or try another deck (e.g., Morgan-Greer or Rider-Waite)."
1,Not a quality bag,"I'm going to have to return it. It is made of cheap vinyl and looks like it. The clasp and handle attachments are cheap-looking, too.It is also tiny.All in all, it would only be good to give to a child for dress-up, but you could get a bag for that at Goodwill and help handicapped people and save money at the same time. Heck, for the price they are charging for one of these, you could get 20 bags at Goodwill or Salvation Army if they are 50 cents each."
4,great value. cute purse for little money.,"This little purse is so cute and fun. It is lined in tourquois and essentails fit nicely. It is prefect to complete an outfit. I have had several compliments from friends. Great price, great value."
3,Use with Caution,"The first story is wonderfully sweet and really adorable. I loved it! Then comes a poem, again it's wonderful. Then the book takes a turn for the worse. The next two stories are full of siblings teasing each other without any involvement or guidance from the parents. Definately not the model of a loving relationship between siblings! The last story seems cute at first, until you realize how good this little girl is at manipulating her clueless father. Reading that one is just asking a child to try ""I'm not tired"" as a means for getting to stay up late. Bleh, no thanks!I'd still recommend this book, but only for the first story and the first poem. Skip the rest."
2,"For completists, barely.....","Though their are intermittent flashes of what the post-John Cale Velvets could do on this scanty LP, the climb is barely worth the view, in a sense. The other post-breakup unreleased album 'VU', far outstrips this one, and were it not for the legal red-tape, they would have made a formidable double."
2,"from the people who gave us ""heroin"" and ""pale blue eyes""","as unthinkable as it might seem to the informed and enlightened, the mighty velvet underground were capable of being simply mediocre. displaying a confounding lack of imagination these songs deserve to be lost again."
2,Forgettable,"late era vault tapes from one of rock's most seminal bands. A few early outtakes have some Cale on them, but the songs are so lame, who cares? Annoying version one of ""Hey Mr. Rain"" ruins the marginally better version two, ""Real Good Time Together"" isn't any better here than it is on Reed's solo album, and you can do without the original ""Rock and Roll"" that's here too. ""Ferryboat Bill"" is of some amusement, but one nugget out of nine? If you have to have unreleased Velvets, ""VU"" is the album to buy, in fact its a must have. Novices, don't start here-fans, buy something influenced by the Velvets instead."
4,"Live version of America makes it a ""must have"" for ELP fans.","This is one of those Cd's you better buy now. Once the IPOD nation takes over, I seriously doubt you'll be able to find this to download. The version of America is everything. As a kid listening to this album for the first time, I couldnt imagine how he was getting those sounds out of the organ. I assumed he had some sort of Moog or Arp involved. When a friend pointed out that on stage synths didnt exist at the time this was recorded, I realized Keith's genius! Theres a fire & rage is his early playing thats as wicked as Hendrix and as punk as Steve Jones!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!!!!!!!!,"The Brother 1820C has some nice features BUT it cleans the ink cartridges automatically and often. This uses up all the ink every few months, whether you print anything or not. I don't do any color faxing or printing, but I have to replace the color cartridges every 3-4 months, so that in a year I spend more on ink that I don't even use than the cost of a new 1820C machine. This is an ink guzzler. It will break your pocketbook unless you are wealthy and money does not matter to you. In addition, there seems to be no way to use the black ink option when the color ink is depleted by the constant automatic cleaning. You MUST replace all 4 ink cartridges every 3-4 months or the fax will not work. It costs a veritable fortune. I cannot recommend this machine except for multimillionaires."
1,This is the worst fax machine ever!,In all my life I have never owned a more frustrating fax machine. I am on my second replacement of this model (they are sending the third right now because this one doesn't work either) and I have had the same problems over and over again. The phone constantly cuts out in the middle of conversations and EVERY time I try to fax something that is more than one page it feeds all the pages through at once rather that one at a time. I have to babysit the machine and feed each paper one at a time to get a fax to go through properly. This machine has wasted my time and money!!! DO NOT BUY IT!!!
4,Great Black Denim Jacket,"Searched long and hard for a good black denim jacket on the internet, finally found one through Amazon, the jacket is a port authority authentic denim jacket (J762) size large. The size was on the money, it fits great. After the first wash nothing faded still looks great. I bought this for one reason mainly, my job is greasy and the black jacket won't show the grease so bad. But now after getting the first jacket I wish I would have bought two, this jacket would work real good on my harley in the late spring and early fall."
3,"They're definition of ""big"" is different than mine.","Okay, I'm big. I can't buy a jacket off the shelf.When a shirt/coat/jacket says ""Big"", I take it to mean that it has more room in the belly than their standard one.Now, maybe this one does, but not enough. The killer is that the shoulders are HUGE.So, this is perfect for someone who is a professional wrestler, not so much for me.Time for that diet. Meanwhile, this is relegated to the closet."
5,Just what I'd hoped,The jacket arrived right on time and was just what I'd hoped it would be! I did order 1 size larger than my husbands actual size. Great classic look!
2,slow shiper,"the size runs really small, if ordering qne order 1-2 sizes bigger than you wear. Alos shipping is very very slow, so don't get in no hurry. Would not recomend doing bisnuess with this company again,"
3,took forever,it took almost a month for the item to get here it was ordered on the 4th estimated arrival date was the 11th-16th it didn't show up until the 24th. but it was exactly as described and the fit was perfect.
1,Its not what you think it is,"I read all the reviews and it was like half bad and half good reviews so i took the chance and ordered it. I got it here before it was supposed to come like 5 days before which was cool but once i got it i was really disappointed. I own a levi trucker jacket.....this one was nothing like it. The size was bigger than a regular medium..... and it was real baggy and it was really odd shaped like i read in one review. Im returned it the next day. Honestly even though levi's are pricey, they are totally worth the money and they last forever. I don""t recommend this jacket. Please trust the reviews."
2,fun for a day,"This game was fun for the first few hours, but the lack of variety makes it boring. It's also too much management.. you have to keep the station running while socializing the characters. You also have to play the same characters over and over and can't create your own characters. There isn't much variety with what you can put in the space station either.. overall, I regret buying this game.. to me at least, it was a waste of money."
2,This game gets annoying fast.,"This game gets annoying fast.It has so much potential. Problem is, it's way too much micro managing. Not only are you trying to keepall your resources coming in, you are trying to get all of you crew to like each other. I lasted a week on this game. I thoughtthe building of the space port was cool. Personally i thought this was going to be like Sim City. It' not. It's veryannoying. The sound effects alone get on your nerves real quick.I had a big port, and lots of nice equipment and hotel. This gave me so much money I could train all my peopleto be super efficient, and create lots of fast robots to work. I STILL didn't have enough time to get my people to like one another.Rent this game. If you last more then a few days, buy it. If you DO buy it, save the receipt."
3,Interesting concept but limited gameplay,"When compared to The Sims, this game seems very limited and I got bored eventually. I like the concept of working at a space station to establish a presence on another planet. You can switch characters, and have objectives to fulfill, but it needs to be more dynamic."
4,The Demo Rocks,"While the demo is shorter than I would have liked, which is why I've just ordered the whole game, it was fun. Think The Sims with purpose. The different missions and goals give you something to work with. And the characters come with some specific talents, rather than you trying to guess what they would do well in as a career. I am really looking forward to the game arriving, though it won't do so fast enough."
2,space colony,This game is great if you like being bored. I paid ten dollars for it and feel ripped off.
1,SPACE COLONY SUCKS,Anyone who would want to play this game is stupid. All it does is swear. THE SIMS IS SO MUCH BETTER!
4,"good condition upon arrival, quick delievery","I purchased this item for my husband for Christmas and we have enjoyed the wild life viewed on these dvds. Marty's views seem to be anti-everyone and the information is very old and at times incorrect but my husband enjoys the photography of the animals. I am glad for the purchase, but Marty just doesn't have the greatest information on the animals he recorded.He used at least three different bears to represent on baby bear in the two episodes of the Man who loved bears.we laugh a lot."
3,Picture quality is not very good,"I do like the contents, but the picture quality and sound are not very good.They look and sound like old VHS tapes."
2,Wild America,I love the show for the years it was out. And for the price I paid for it and being a collection set that the dvd's could have been in a collective sleeve's instead of single paper sleeves.And coping quality is not good. The product is not worth the price I paid for it.
4,Wild America,I gave this product a 4 star rating only because Marty Stouffer refers to evolution so much. Our son loves to watch these DVD's. The wild life footage and information about the different species is incredable. Well worth the money !!
5,"A Timeless Classic, Awesome deal!!!","I remember watching this series on PBS when I was younger, and now that I have a couple little ones I can share some classic, yet accurate footage of American wildlife with them. I just received this a couple days ago and it is already a hit with my daughter! Some things just don't get old."
3,"Buy this after Songs of Praise, Sound of Music, and Smart Alex","This album is not bad, but it is not great. Their are no tracks that get the blood pumping, but it does not put you to sleep either. Its still got a punk edge to it though. For serious fans only I guess. I do not regret buying it"
4,Good but slow,"The Pharos GPS receiver is working fine out of the box, but it often takes a loooooooong time to lock to satellite signals. I am not sure if this is due to the GPS receiver itself, or to the Ostia software, though.Overall it is quite reliable (if I wait long enough... ). :)"
3,Reasonable Start,"This DVD is video transfer of the WB Bass Basics VHS video that has been out for many years. No new content, but the DVD is handy for skipping ahead and repeating.That said, I tried it (having no prior bass experience) and found it to be a reasonable start. Less time is spent on the fundamentals and more time is spent covering a wide subject range... For example, does a first time bassist really need to learn how to slap and pop when you don't know what a chord is?? Hmmm...This is much better than just a CD or VHS tape, but it won't turn you into Les Claypool."
3,fails to hit the jackpot,Pure junk. The scenes of Monaco are great and the bodyguard in the movie is superb. The rest of the cast and story are beyond lame. The girl is cute but hardly a Brigitte Bardot or Catherine Denevue. The lawyer is a cartoon really. The acting is just too cool for school at times and at other times like a bad Peter Sellers.I really don't know why this film was made. It tried to be a comedy and ends up really a tragedy. It's like they attempted an American comedy (you know where violence has to be thrown in for no apparent reason) but fail on all accounts.
4,not your standard plot,"if you're a rich guy beset by a gold digger, what do you do? of all your choicest, the one made in this film is pretty interesting... worth watching"
1,A waste of the French language.,"Everything and everyone and every word is superficial; the plot is worthy of a dime novel; good scenery, boring plot and music to go with it."
3,empty comedy,"The French can do comedy very well indeed- as anyone who has seen THE VALET can attest. And it is good that when the French do comedy that the come from a uniquely French standpoint: In THE VALET our hero does not get 'the girl' - but he does get the girl he really always wanted- which is actually better than a Hollywood ending (and along the way we get some extremely funny moments).This could have been one of those movies. It was not. But it did have some good moments when it was a pleasure to watch. Other moments- not so much. Still, with a beautiful actress and great location scenery it was not a total waste of time. It just could have been better."
1,Mundane.,"I read this book after having borrowed it from a neighbor of mine who deals with this disorder. We (total of 4 different people) found the book to be very elementary. I noticed that the reviews here are from posters that only reviewed the book and ""love it"", which is a red flag. If you really want to understand Agoraphobia and Panic/Anxiety Disorder, try Freedom From Agoraphobia. It's a rare treat and highly educational. From all of the workbooks I have had my hands on that cover this topic, Freedom From Agoraphobia book made them all look bad. An easy read but covers sub-topics in an honest and sometimes funny way. I can't recall the author, but I got my copy from Amazon.com."
5,Great Book,"It was a present my sister had been searching for, and I found it on Amazon-of course. My sister loved it! Thanks"
5,.55 GE light bulbs,"It took a little longer than I would have liked to receive the product. However, this item could not pe purchased anywhere locally, so I was happy to get it....."
4,Works!,"I wish there was a way for my picky cat to like this! One cat with IBD has no issues with the taste, the picky one wont even let me get near her with it.It does work though! It helped with the runny poo in about 12 hours and it helped for a few weeks before having to give it to him again."
5,As promised,"Received as promised. Ordered for our cat. It did help with the ""loosies"" but didn't completely resolve her problem (antibiotic induced)Got a different vet who changed her food. Flawless transaction."
5,Understandable and comprehensive view of the Gospels,"I've worn out two copies of the paperback version of this book. As clergy, it often gives me jumping off thouhts for sermons, but it gives insights for meditation as well."
3,If you like art...,"This is a limited edition art book, with some proverbial references to Aikido, but mostly, it's about the drawings. An EXTREMELY limited presentation version was also published (100 copies) with cost about ten times that of this edition."
4,Very Ghostly,"Dawn is always one of my favorite character out of two. I wonder, at the first time I read this book, Who is the ghost that's hunting Dawn's secret passage? If I was Dawn, I'll be scared to death and wanna change my room with mom.Dawn had loved ghost, and ghost, and ghost, but well, did she love it when I happen to her. Every time I reread one part, I reread the next part until I reread the whole book and wanna reread more and more like Dawn, wanting to reread her story of ghosts."
1,Absolute GARBAGE,"We were fooled by the Cuisinart name on this item. Expected high quality, but shot within 2 weeks. The handle is metal on the outside, but plastic on the inside. After about a dozen or so can openings, the plastic portion of the handle shattered, instantly turning this unit from can opener to giant paperweight. Poor design. We now happily use a manual can opener with nice beefy handles and will think twice about purchasing any more Cuisinart products."
5,A moral masterpiece,"This is one of my all time valued books. A splended writer, Malouf uses language as a poet, brings his two main characters to vivid life, makes the reader care about both of them...the convict and the soldier (possibly his executioner). What particularly moved me and sets this book above most is how skillfully Malouf raises the question of morality (without moralizing) relative to the judgement of others...Who is not guilty? Or if guilty, what about the compassion of another. These are to me primary questions in a worldwhere finger-pointing is so prevalent. Malouf is a man whose breadth and depth of insight deserve much attention and applause."
3,David Malouf,"I am not going to give you a summary of the book, but it does have very good plot and detailed characters. The book describes characters through flashbacks on their past and what they've had to deal with in the past. I usual like a book with a little more actual conversations and I did find it confusing at time when flashbacks became reality again. I did the author did a good job showing the emotions of each character, you could easily which character was the angry one, the friendly one, and so on and so forth. Overall it wasn't my favorite book just because the dialogue was weak but it is a good read."
3,The first sci-fi novel,"This translation was first published in 1975 by DAW Books, which is the edition I read (same text as this, I suppose). The good news is that this is, in its way, a brilliant feat of the imagination, especially considering it dates from 1854. The bad news is that it was not a work of genius, and is primarily of historical interest only."
4,An astonishing feat!,"What a remarkable artifact to have been published in 1854! The author has created, entirely out of his own imagination, and with no tradition of science fiction behind him, a staggeringly ambitious work: the history of thousands of years in the psi Cassiopeiae star system. And not only history: he has included poetry, folktales, and two plays from the cultures inhabiting the system. Not great literature, perhaps, but I found it fascinating. It made virtually no impression on the literary world at the time and has been almost completely forgotten for 150 years. The book is marred, alas, by a number of obvious typos, and for some reason the author (or is it the translator?) consistently refers to the star as psi Cassiopeia [sic]. And the book is pretty expensive for a trade paperback. But if you're interested in the early days of science fiction, this is a must have."
2,"Good, not Great","This video suffers from not having adequate visuals. Though the content is good, since the ceiling has been renovated marvelously, this video is out of date."
4,trickster,"I loan this book out alot, as it often makes its way into conversation. A history of the miniature empires that have made their clumsy way through the land of the Shoshone people as seen by Coyote, their jester and creator (the two could hardly be mutually exclusive). Miniature empires collapsing just as they've made their plans to conquer the land. Scholarly, cynical, and irreverent, and full of great stories and poetically written."
5,Love the Movie!,I love this movie! I lost my previous copy and I just had to replace it. I grew up watching Dixie's Dinner over and over again. There is not a better movie for kids to watch. They will love the characters and all the songs. It may be an old movie but I am sure the kids will love it!
3,Powerful metaphor of pregnancy,"The author does a wonderful job comparing and contrasting spiritual pregnancy against real pregnancy. An immediate ""To Be Read"" book for women of color who desire a closer walk with the Holy Spirit and are undergoing change in their life. Keep this book on your shelf for reference and meditation."
2,"Don't say ""good"" if it isnt.","This book was listed as being in good condition. When it arrived, numerous pages were underlined (in 3 different colors), the inside cover had been used as a memo pad, and it showed obvious signs of having been wet."
5,COLD FEET,THIS IS THE SECOND PAIR THAT I HAVE PURCHASED. VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT. I DO A LOT OF DEER HUNTING AND NOTHING IS AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS COLD FEET. THIS SOLVES THE PROBLEM.
5,Just what the doctor ordered!,A very pleasurable experience unlike my last trip to the proctologist.A fan of 70's prog rock since the 70's this recording more then satisfied my listening days of old.This ELP is more pop oriented then ELP version 1.0 but still enjoyable.
4,A New Picture for the Exhibition,"Recorded in 1985 and released in 1986, the iconic progressive rock trio with Cozy Powell on drums is more of an offshoot of the ELP that had Carl Palmer as the ""P.""There is powerful energy that emerges out of the album, with pop sensibilities successfully merging with the artistry of several longer pieces. It clearly shows the relevancy of the new ELP as the musical landscape was changing at the speed of light.An interesting track is Mars, the Bringer of War, which was adapted in 1969 by King Crimson, a band that featured Greg Lake. The singles were Touch and Go b/w Learning to Fly and Lay Down Your Guns b/w Step Aside. The CD bonus tracks are the pop classic Loco-Motion and Vacant Possession.It was the start of something that had unlimited potential, though Emerson, Lake & Powell proved to be a beginning and an end. There was never a second studio release due to management problems, though albums featuring rehearsal tapes and a live show were eventually issued."
3,"Emerson, Lake, but no Palmer","This was a 2/3 comeback by ELP, with drumming by Cozy Powell instead of Carl Palmer. This CD is worth purchasing for their version of ""Mars, the Bringer of War"" from Gustav Holst's classical composition ""The Planets"". I actually saw Emerson, Lake & Powell in concert in support of this record, and ""Mars"" was one of the highlights of the show. The bonus tracks are okay, but I prefer the original song selections. The best parts of this CD are the first 4 song, and ""Mars"". The others seem to be at best throw-aways. Although this version of ELP was pretty much a one-off edition, it is worth a listen, particularly if you like the original ELP."
3,More like 3 1/2 stars....,"Not too bad of an album. ""Lay Down Your Guns"" is the opus of this record. ""Touch & Go"" got all the airplay, but that was because of the death of AOR stations. Cozy was good live when I saw them, did all the old ELP tunes justice. The only dopey thing was the instrumental of the ""Locomotion"". I wish they would have spent some time & created something unique, not some filler simply to add anoter few minutes for the listener."
3,Floppy Sides!,"It may look like a box in the on-line picture but the sides have no support in them and are floppy. If you are looking for clean straight lines, this isn't for you. The sides will bulge to the shape of the items that are put in it! Although, I do like the fabric and design. Just wish there was side supports!"
3,Reprint the original with color prints and engravings,"I will only state briefly, that I have an abiding interest inarctic exploration and I find that this edition, while very useful,does not do justice to the 1897 original in that the many engravings and esp the color prints are missing. One must purchase a used book to get the whole flavor of the original."
3,Would be Better as a Three Book Series.,Skip the preparation section unless you are really interested in how many tons of coal or potatoes Nansen took along. Skip the final section by Sverdrup on his return from the ice unless you have trouble sleeping at night. The only part really worth reading is the tale of Nansen and his partner 'walking' home (close to home anyway) over the ice. Nansen wrote this from the comfort of his home but still has a casual attitude to this amazing 'walk'.
1,buyers beware!,"I would strongly warn anybody thinking of buying this book (at least this edition)...I purchased it a few days ago, thinking I would get a great paperback (sold by Amazon, after all!), but when it arrived the cover was different then pictured here and the pages inside are indescribable...the best I can say is that someone found this book scanned online, then went to a local Kinko's store, printed it, and slapped a fairly decent cover to make it look like a good edition. Some pages were completely unreadable, with sentences breaking off in the middle of the page and continuing on the next one, while others had entire paragraphs composed of only question marks and exclamation points (and other special characters, as if someone had just slapped their hands on the computer keyboard). I can't believe Amazon is selling this! Very disappointing, I was really looking forward to reading this book."
3,Not bad for the price,"These are NOT professional quality, nor are they the quality of a KA mixer. KA is entering the marketplace of people who want a sturdy item with lots of ""OOOOOOOH factor"" so they're now making some cheap stuff like plastic mixing bowls and measuring cups. They ARE very decent quality, not bad knives. I'm using these now as workhorse knives. When I'm really serious though I break out my mixed singles of Shun, Global, Kyocera and Gerber. Gotta admit though, these do look good next to my cobalt blue KA 6Qt mixer, blender, imersion blender, food processor and utensil set (and a few other non cobalt blue KA gadgets) which is why I really bought them."
1,X PLAY REVIEW HIGHLITES,DON'T BUY THIS GAME !! It looks like it came off the PS1. The controls are not good and the camera is awful. Check out the X-play review.
1,SAVE YOUR CASH!!!!,I would say this game is not worth the time of writing this review. If you like Mech game's then there are better Mech game's out there. I played this game for about 30 minute's and that's all I could take from this piece of crap. SAVE YOU'RE MONEY!!!! Graphic's are like a 32bit. Reminds me of playing on my ORIGINAL NINTENDO. It's like they graves an old game and put it on a PS3 game disk. Not worth more then $1.95 and that being generous.
2,Definitely not a showcase for PS3 power....,"I like battling giant robots, and in this respect the game is pretty good, but the graphics are really a huge letdown. As another reviewer said, it looks like it came out of a PS1, and that's true, textures are murky, robot models are angular and low on detail... As one of the console's launch titles, it must be kept far far away from any demonstration booths..."
1,HARDCORE TRASH!,"You have not played trash until you play this. This is TRASH AT IT'S BEST! I kid you not, this could've passed for a PS1 game due to the terrible, sorry graphics. Controls sucked,and the camera angles are a joke. I'm still amazed how bad everything was, especially the graphics. I had to look at the disc to make sure I was playing a PS3 game and not a PS1 game. It doesn't even look like a PS2 game at least. That's sad. It's almost like someone copied and pasted a PS1 game to a PS3 disc. The backgrounds are also ridiculous. The water doesn't even move when you touch it. As for all the other reviewers on here who say this game is okay, maybe they got a different copy from the one I purchased. There's no way in Hell we could've been playing the same game. This game should not be on sell anymore. They just need to give this away the minute you walk into the store. Save your money and buy a box of cereal with it, cause that will be money well spent than on this crap."
3,Frustrating,"The game doesn't have a lot of the mechs everyone knows and loves that are in the anime. So don't expect to be playing in a Wing Zero or a Burning Gundam.The difficulty is WAY too hard on normal. You literally can die in about 3 hits if you're not careful.If you do buy this game, start out on easy mode."
2,If I didn't like gundam. I wouldn't have given it two stars overall.,"This game was whack, I like the gundam series but this was total utter disappointment. The price of 54 dollars for this game right now is outrageous. You could suck it up and buy the Gundam Senki game which looks like a full version of what this game was supposed to be for 70 dollars. Yes its in japanese but at least you will have 10x the fun playing it."
1,Don't Waste Your Money...,"Put it this way, if Amazon had the option for zero stars, this game would get it. Graphics are sub-par, gameplay is just plain bad. I rented this from Blockbuster, played it for a few hours, then returned it that night. Of the all of the titles released or due for release for the PS3, this one gets my vote for being the worst. You'd think the developers at Namco would've realized this before they released it. Don't waste your time or money."
3,its Not that bad..,"mobile suit gundam...i remember seeing the preview for this when i picked up my ps3 on launch night i liked what i saw .. so i picked up a copy . ive heard a lot of bad reviews on this game etc..and honestly this game is a mixed bag. there is a lot of fun to be had with this one..if you just give it a chance...sure, the gameplay could be a bit faster ..but it works for gundam (this is like a sim to a degree in my opinion ) .. ok, its NOT as fluid and action packed as robotech though people tend to forget that.. But this game works..say whatever you want, but you have to admit.. it made an interesting launch title...and its worth a space in your collection.."
4,it's worth the $15,"this game's worth the money i spent on it.is it the best gundam game, no. but is it the worst, far from it. im a huge gundam fan, and idc wtf anybody says, this game is fun, and the graphics dont look like their for the ps1. it's a pretty good attempt at a gundam game for the ps3"
2,"Despite my hopes, it's crap","Just to clarify I really like Journey to Jaburo on the Playstation 2. And by the looks of this game I thought that Gundam Crossfire was a HD version, but boy was I wrong.I really like how the game utilizes dozens of mobile suit models, everything from the ubiquitous Zaku II to Norris Packards Gouf Custom. Everything is here, GM's, Doms, Hygoggs, Zoks, if you can think of a mobile suit that made an appearance during the UC period it's pretty much included.But unfortunately game play design decisions basically ruined this game. My biggest complaint is that your weapon arm can be shot off very easily, on more than one occasion I found my mobile suit literally shin kicking its way through a level because I had lost the weapon arm within the first 30 seconds of a level.Even if you're a diehard Gundam fan you'll be (shin) kicking yourself for buying this one."
2,disappointed,"This cd was listed as used, but it was NOT in good condition. It was scratched and one song does not play due to the scratches. This is the first time I have had a problem with any product I have purchased from Amazon."
3,The Beatles' story seen from their own inner circle,"A kiss-and-tell rendition of the Beatles's story, somewhat unflattering. The Love You Make is easy read that spans the Beatles's entire career from their beginnings in Liverpool onto their international superstardom, continuing through the years that followed their disbanding. The authors provide an insider look at their world tours, their personal lives, the relationships within their own inner circle, their experimentation with drugs and eastern meditation, the formation of Apple records, John Lennon's complicated relationships with Brian Epstein, his first wife Cynthia, and his second wife Yoko Ono, and the acrimony following the group's breakup in 1969. Good for fans who want to know more about the Beatles' personal lives, warts and all."
5,Yeah,Probably one of the best rock biographies ever written. I read it (couple of years ago) in almost one go.
3,"""Nothing has been held back, even when it shocks"".","As the paperback cover states, longtime Beatle insider Peter Brown dishes out the dirt, National Enquirer style. Written with the cooperation of the Beatles, their wives/girlfriends etc., there was nonetheless a backlash when they read what went to print (though they didn't deny much of it) and he was forever cut from the Beatles' inner circle. Lots of information about the drug and sexual habits of those cuddly Liverpudlians, as well as the antics of manager Brian Epstein. Nice to know these things, but I think I'll just listen to their music."
5,"Five stars for entertainment value, not content quality!","Who knows how much of what Peter Brown says is true? It's clear that many of the anecdotes he relates have been discredited (i.e., John Lennon's one night stand with Brian Epstein), but this is still an entertaining light read for anyone who likes or loves The Beatles.The opening chapter makes you sad--Brown begins with Cynthia Lennon coming home from a weekend trip to find Yoko Ono casually counging around the house in Cynthia's bathrobe. You can almost feel how humiliated she must have been.Five stars as a good beach book, with the caveat that it's far from complete and not completely reliable."
4,Gripping,"Whether or not you are a fan of the Beatles, this book is absolutely gripping. It reads like a juicy soap-opera of drug-addiction, bitching over money, sex scandals and the messy break-up. Beware though-I came away thinking that that Beatles and their entourage of wives, girlfriends, financers, and suck-ups were a bunch of jerks.Extremely well-written though."
3,Dirty but an atmospheric read,"This book is shocking, lurid, depressing. Quite why former Beatles confidante Peter Brown should want to turn on his employers by hooking up with slash and burn writer Gaines is not known to me. But, God help me, it's interesting. Good for those who can stand gossip, with all the pros and cons that entails."
1,Another round of pissed-off envy --,"Peter Brown is one of those Lennon named as pissed at The Beatles because their breakup meant the end of the gravy train for such as Brown, who was a late-comer as it was.This was originally rushed into print shortly after Lennon was murdered (as were so many others intending to capitalize) -- and, ""coincidentally,"" no longer able to respond to the dirt Brown peddles against him. (How did Peter Brown manage to be in the room with John and Yoko when they were doing drugs, eh?) Brown was one of the ""suits"" who, as Peter McCabe points out (""Apple to the Core""), mostly took two-hour martini lunches."
5,Excellent book!,"This is my must have book (bible) for my research on environmental enrichment. If you work with animals in a captive situation, you need to read this book. The book also deals with stereotypy. A lot of excellent information on enrichment and its implications for captive animals. If you are at all interested in environmental enrichment or currently implement an enrichment program for your animals, do yourself a favor and read this book."
4,There are NO rules,"This Vale Tudo event is just like the earliest UFC events. No gloves, no judges, no weight classes, no time limit, and no rounds. Only rules are no biting and no eye gouging. Also similar to the early UFC's is the fact that many of these fighters are not cross-trained like modern MMA atheletes. Unlike the UFC though, this event is held in a ring.I.V.C. 1 is an 8-man tournament format. There's an alternate fight in addition to a Super-Fight involving Dan ""The Beast"" Severn. Other familiar faces in the tourney include Gary ""Big Daddy"" Goodridge and Cal Worsham. Worsham is always a game competitor but lacks MMA technique. Big Daddy is tough as always but fights dirty in this tourney. Check out this event for some bare-knuckle nastiness."
3,Good book but outdated,"Zartman was one of the first writers to actually place the focus on state failure and its links to terrorism. However, this book has become slightly outdated and is too narrowly focused on the cases of Africa. It is a comprehensive read and contains extremely detailed case study insight to the African cases of state failure. It highlights very important flaws in international policy toward failed/failing/weak states and provides an ideal base for a historical observation of the African continent's long time struggles against state failure, corruption and terrorist activity. Overall a good book but as mentioned earlier it has becomeoutdated."
5,Linkin Park rocks!!!!,"Linkin Park is my FAVORITE band.Chester's vocal is very powerful and Mike is the best rapper I've ever seen.Their music style is so ""hybrid"" that it really surprises me and change my point of view of rock music.Highly recommend this CD!!"
3,"Tired stuff, but good for what it is.","The guitar riffs are simple and recycled throughout the album. Even the chord progressions are recycled. But I like Chester's voice, and to be honest, Mike's rapping is pretty good! But this is NOT metal. And this is NOT hip-hop. I don't hear this stuff on [local radio stations]. ...As a result, the most interesting (and best) song on the album is Cure for the Itch, by far, because it's pure, not postured."
4,a great cd,"This is a great CD. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because there is a little bit too much screaming. I like songs 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10 11 is cool, but its more just for fun. This is an awesome CD and you won't regret buying it."
4,A good buy,This cd is worth it. if you like the rap/rock style than this is your cd. the rapping is good and the singer's crazy loud voice adds to it. It takes awhile but once you listen to the songs a couple of times you get used to it and start to get in to it. My favorites are:1: Because it has a good beat. 5: Because of the guys crazy and after awhile annoying voice. 6: Nice rap and chours 8: a more meaningful song more rap good chours 9: good rap has a nice beat and chours 10: starts out fast and loud but calms down and rocks!Overall a good buy!
4,hooked again,"To tell you the truth, I thought I belonged to that generation that was over music with angst and inner turmoil as their theme. I was wrong. The first time I heard ""Paper Cut"" I knew I had to take my azz to the record store. I used be into Korn and its likes for a long time but gave it up simply because grew tired of the screaming. However, these guys are able to deliver their message in a different way, with soft, almost boy-band like vocals at times. It creates a grim but still fresh soundscape. I lost this album after a week and had to go buy a new one right away because I just can't stop listening to it. Can't recommend this album enough!!!"
5,Simply Amazing,"Before I bought this CD I thought Linkin Park was just another garage band. I was SERIOUSLY wrong. This has got to be the greatest CD I have heard. With songs like Crawling, Points of Authority, and In the End, you have a perfect combination of rap and rock. I highly recommend this CD. But be warned, this is not for people who like to listen to music on the lowest volume. Buy this and enjoy a musical masterpiece."
5,What a debut album!!!,"Linkin Park is one of the rare bands who can mix up alternative,metal,hip-hop perfectly.Besides having 2 incredible good singers,the band manages to combine pervading guitar riffs to their songs without lowering their 2 frontmans' abilities.What is really striking is the maturity of this album.The lyrics are extraodinary and you can easily relate to them.The melodies are astonishing as well as the DJ's amazing stuff.You'll hear it if you buy the album.They have made the perfect start and i pray that it is not the last.An absolute album for beginners and metal true fans."
5,Great!,This album is definitely the best LinkinPark album! It's before they went more electronic rather than good rock. And highly recommend purchasing it- if you haven't already!
4,Great deal,I am a fan so all there music is worth the money This is not as good as the others but still good
3,Hmm...,"I was a fan of Linkin Park until I started listening to other music. There still ""good"" in a way but I haven't been listening to their albums much anymore. Meteora's just a repeat of Hybrid Theory. I think I over played them, so I guess if you listen to them more than three times or something, you wouldn't want to listen to them again.The guitar work is incredibly stupid, especially in runaway. Same two chords over and over again. The lead singer sounds like a girl. I don't like rap much so it's not that good. They use stupid protools to make the drumming sound more ""experty"" thingo.I dunno what to do now..."
2,NOT THAT GREAT,THESE GUY ARENT THAT GREAT.... BUY TAPROOT THEY BLOW LINKIN PARK WAY OUT THE WATER... JUST CHECK THE MAGAZINE REVIEWS...THEY LABEL TAPROOT GREAT...AND LINKIN PARK JUST ANOTHER RAP ROCK BAND... TAPROOT FOREVER
2,ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm,"this band is wayy to over played, they get on my nerves, they rap to much, the only reason i gave them 2 stars is cause of ""One Step Closer"". It's their heaviest song, and its with screaming and all. so i kinda dig it...other than that, they have like videos for every song, they collaborated with Jay-Z which made me loose all respect for them, even though there wasnt much to begin with, and overall im glad i burned this CD instead of buying it....dont waste your money"
1,Linkin Park have a mixture of rap and heavy metal,"But what band doesn't? Just off the top of my head, I can think of 13. Biohazard, Anthrax, Korn, Deftones, Papa Roach, Incubus (yes, Incubus were once rap-rock), Limp Bizkit, P.O.D., Quarashi, 311, Kid Rock, Crazy Town, and Saliva."
1,best of 2002,"back in 2002 i got this and for the last 3 years it has been my favorite cd. lincoln parks best single on this one is somewhere i belong. the cool thing about this one is that you get the 3 bonus tracks, ""crawling"" and ""at the end"". even though this one is good, it doesnt compare to their 1999 classic, metora. another great single on this one is paperclip, it is cool in the part where mike goes, i want to heal, i want to feel like im close to somthing real. this is the best cd iv gotten after my brain surgery, and i think that linkin park is just a cheap rip off of lincoln park, even their name sounds the same!"
1,Rap?,"This is just baaad! Lets see, I will put rap and turntables with a few riffs and I have Linkin Park. And the worst part is people actually believe they are listening to metal!!! Thats what is sooo dumb about it all! If you REALLY know what metal is you would know this is NOT metal at all! Real metal-Godsmack, Pantera, Slayer, old Metallica. Nu-Metal that is good-KoRn, Distrubed, System of a Down, Slipknot, and Mudvayne to name a few. BUT Linkin Park should not even be classified as nu-metal! It is an insult to people that actually know what metal is! How you know this isnt metal is because teen girls enjoy it. They like it because Chester Bennington is ""hot"" and he sound like Nsync. If you put rap, pop, and a few pitiful riffs into a blender you would get this. Do everybody a favor and dont classify this as metal, more like ""rapcore""."
1,Crappy modern rock band,"This stuff SUCKS...it's really funny to laugh at how all you people can only say that it's ""emotional"" or ""there is good rapping""....how about if there is actually ""a good guitar solo"" or mabye ""NO rappin""Go get some REAL rockyo wats up dogg I'm a albino rapper"
1,this band truly sucks!!!!!,"Linkin Park is soo hardcore I can't believe it. Bands like Slipknot, Cannibal Corpse, Metallica, Dimmu Borgir and Killswitch Engage are really wimpy compared to this stuff! The rapper and frontman in this band blow Corey Taylor away! The guitar players are so much more skilled than Kirk Hammet!</sarcasm>This is basically mainstram crap that makes me look like a great guitar player and I just started 4 years ago! I've probably been playing 3 years and 11 months longer than the guys in this band, and it really shows.This isn't rock, it has RAP lyrics which ruins it. This is not rap/hiphop, it has really pathetic guitar playing accompanying the rapper, this is not metal or nu-metal, it's way too wimpy to be even Nu-Metal, and this isn't punk, it's too poser.Listen to real rock (blur) real rap (eminem) real metal (Metallica) real ""Nu-Metal"" (KoRn), or Death Metal (Dimmu Borgir) or real punk (NOFX). this is totally pathetic, I can't even describe it.You posers know I'm right..."
1,You are all brainwashed little children,"Just look at all of these 5 star reviews, wow, [...]. if MTV tells you its cool, then it must be awesome! wow, i think i'm gonna go shop at hot topic with all of my poser freinds so everone will think i'm ""down with it"". just because these retards are popular now doesnt mean it will last,in about less then 2 years from now no one will know who the they are any more anyway. it takes no talent to get the fame if you have the right promotion, money and just come out at the right moment in the buisness, like these retards have. remember that band Nickleback? yeah, i thought so."
5,"They may be the boyband of rock, but maybe that's good...","Linkin Park is, in essence, the boyband of modern rock. Their lyrics are clean, without any swearing or offensive phrases, their music is clean (this is definately not metal, people), and their sound truly is hybrid of pop, rock and industrial electronica. Their most popular song is clearly 'In The End,' an epic and almost romantic single that has launched their careers. But listeners will be pleased to find that 'Hybrid Theory' is more than a vehicle for their hit single, and is in itself an excellent and high-quality CD well worth the money, with top-notch writing and mixing. Though it can be argued that many of Linkin Park's songs sound the same, it's a good sound, so maybe that's not such a bad thing.Note: If you can, purchase the import, as it has the song 'My December,' quite possibly Linkin Park's most beautiful track ('My December' was omitted from the US edition)."
4,One of the best new rock cds,"Compared to most of the other nu-metal and rap/rock ... coming out these days, Hybrid Theory is a very good album. It is very catchy and melodic and is fast and short enough to listen to over and over again. In the End and Crawling have great beats and solid lyrics, and the jumpy rhythm of Points of Authority is one of the cd's highlights.However, while the Grammy nominations the album recieved were well-deserved considering the competition, they would have been scoffed at 5-10 years ago. By today's standards Linkin Park is a good band, but compared to the likes of Nirvana and the Smashing Pumpkins they are musical midgets. Electronically manufactured music just can't match the true instrumental talent and creativity of the early 90's bands. Nonetheless, it is a decent album and worth the $...you'll pay for it."
1,Linkin Park Is One of the Worst Bands Out Today,"There are so many bands out there that are a million times better than Linkin Park and it's really sad to see this [garbage] as a top seller and get so much MTV and radio airplay. It also bothers me that DJ's will speak of them as if they're the most original band that ever existed. Contrary to popular believe, they aren't original at all. Electronics and metal were combined, and done better I might add, by Industrial groups during the 80's. I suggest instead of getting this go out and get a Ministry album like Psalm 69. Go get Skinny Puppy's Rabies or The Process albums or Ohgr's albums. He's relesing a new one in July. They are a million times better than this garbage."
1,Dont make me laugh...,"...Anybody who calls this metal or a ""rap-rock classic"" is either brain dead, or is ten years old. Want real rap-rock? Rage Against the Machine and the Red Hot Chili Peppers are the way to go. Want real metal? Anything from Black Sabbath to Megadeth to Dimmu Borgir works. This is pop, just POP! Linkin Park is a watered down version of Nirvana, without the insightful lyrics and great songwriting. All you have here are a bunch of homos whining about how much their lives suck. ""Oh BOO HOO, I have money, but not enough to fill my tub! WHAAAAAAAAAAA!!!"". What a horrible excuse of a band, and while Hybrid thermous isn't as bad as the ghastly Meteora, it still deserves 1 star. I cant wait until this pathetic excuse of a band is forgotten and is wiped off the face of the earth.Yep, I know, not helpful..."
1,People....Just Say No,"Linkin Park is horrible. I have seen that some people call them nu-metal. I literally fell out of my seat laughing. Linkin Park is barely any rock, mainly rap. Linkin Park's music sounds like it's coming out of something dying. Linkin Park had many hits with this record such as ""Closer"" and stuff like that. But, there are so many horrible songs I don't know where to begin."
3,Linkin Park = Ive heard this before...,"Hmm...what to say about Linkin Park. At first, i must say, i loved the band and everything about them. But after a couple of months, im beginning to realize that ive heard this before. This music...whatever you want to call it....is NOT nu-metal. This is NOT rock. This is...at its simplest, POP. Yes it is POP. That 3-letter word hated upon a starting ""rock"" or ""nu-metal"" group. Linkin Park is nothing but POP. If you want to listen to somthing better, i suggest Silverchair, Staind, Slipknot, or Marilyn Manson, people who actually put out good music. (...)"
2,Mainstream,"Linkin Park is a really bad band in my eyes. I've tried to like them but their music isn't good and the rap lyrics ruin it all for me.If you're thinking about buying this I'd STRONGLY suggest getting Slipknot's self-titled album instead, it has some rap but it's heavier, more intense, and the singing (or screaming if you will) is a lot better on Slipknot than it is on this album."
5,great,"I must have listened to this cd a thousand times, too bad I misplaced it or I would listen still. One of the best of my collection."
2,Pretty Much Garbage,"Well, see, the thing that gets me, is people that like to call this music ""metal"" and ""rock."" What this is, is a joke! It's overplayed MTV [stuff]...I mean, seriously, the music sounds like a lot of other stuff that's floating around and overall, it is just plain bad. The reason I gave it two stars is because there is one song that I somewhat care for, and that is ""Pushing Me Away,"" mainly because this song was different from the rest on the CD. If you want to listen to REAL rock and metal, check out some stuff by Slayer, Slipknot, Mudvayne, or In Flames."
2,Good Metal.....WHAT'S WITH THE RAP?,This was really annoying. I know that these guys are good musiciansbut they're such wannabes. None of them are black which would be a good excuse and furthermore they suck at rapping. People like Kid Rock and Fred Durst out-white-rapped these guys. The metal parts are the only parts i could stand. hopefully their other cds are better but after this i don't think i could take it.
2,Not good,"I mostly bought this cd for the song ""Crawling"", and it is basically the only good one on here. Excpet for maybe ""One Step Closer"". I dont like rap, which this has a lot of."
3,"Fun stuff, but now worth all the hype...",Burn it from a friend that bought a copy.It is a good album...but now worth purchasing only worth listening to.
3,Linkin park,"Linkin park new cd is a good cd but it only have a few good songs like crawling, one step closer, points of authority, with me, etc I have it but i dont really like it very very much"
5,Because I dont care what YOU THINK,"I have found this CD to be one of THE BEST pieces of artistry I have ever listened to....The album is tremendous- expressing anger, depression, remorse... everything. Chester Bennington's early struggles echo throughout the lyrics brining an eery truth to the music. While people may say the musical aspects are ""basic""- but blended together it is enough to breathe life and energy without overkill. Major ""metal heads"" may find this album ""weak""- but they can find other heavier artists."
3,Great Album... Why the same rating as Abbey Road and others,"This is a great album. I was recently converted to Linkin Park by some friends who all told me of how good they were. But the problem is... That is what it is... a ""good"" album. I dont feel it to be on par with Abbey Road, Sgt. Pepper, Revolver, Blonde on Blonde, Joshua Tree, Highway 61, Blood on the tracks, Night at the opera (queen), Led Zeppelin IV, or even Nevermind. Look up ANY of those albums which I GUARANTEE will be on 99% of the ""top 100 cds all time) but look them up here on Amazon. the best rating they get is 4.5 how sad that a REVOLUTIONARY album like Sgt. Pepper gets the same rating as a BRAND NEW good album that has not lasted more than a year. in 10 20 or even 40 years (im 18 btw), if I can pull out ""Hybrid Theory"" and say WOW, thats some good music then I will rate it 5. In conclusion, this is a great adition to any collection but please, it is undeserving of a ""5"". but buy it."
2,Don't waste your money.,"This cd is ok, but once you listen to it a few times, you realize that its all kinda fake. The lyrics are pretty awful as well. Usually, the songs start out good like With You, but go downhill from there. This band really is pretty shallow and there's no real meaning in their songs. If you're thinking about buying this, I'd say don't waste your money on this bland album and buy something real."
2,"I'd hate to diss a rock band, but...","The first time I bought this CD, I probaly listened to it enough to say the lyrics fast enough (well, almost), however, soon did I relize that it was ""just a phase"".As an artist, I found the song writing so whiney, I now have to skip the track(s), I'd might as well sell it, honestly.. May I add, the song writing is issues that have already been written about.(this over said ""breaking"" and ""falling apart"", I'd really like to send this band a Synonym book) I'd say, that's the main weakness in the nu-metal scene, Linkin Park is just adding on to the mellon collie tradegy of Nu-Metal...Even a lot of the beats, I hate to say this but, it sounds rather, repetitive. Almost as If, a scientist going back to old quantum theory within confusion..."
2,Almost made it,"When I first put this CD in, it sounded like it was going to be a great album. But as the songs go by, it starts to get very annoying. The guitar and lead singer combination is great, but the horrible (should I say) ""pseudo-rap"" mixed in just ruins it. It is really sad. I mean these guys have what it takes to be a great band, but the rapping makes Kid Rock look like the Master (and might I say, Kid Rock is about the lamest rapper out there). Good rapping is very difficult, and these guys sound more like they're talking. There is no groove or feel to the rap they do on this album. If they were smart, they'd drop it and stick to the melodic hard rock that they're more than capable of producing."
4,How should i do this in a kind and genial way...,"SHUT THE F**K UP! NO, they are not the most original band out there. YES, some of their chords and techniques are simple. But ease off, people!It's still music. I really enjoy their rap/alt style, and simple though their lyrics may be, they are quite enjoyable. And what's all this obsession about hardcoreness? WHO GIVES A RAT'S ASS? The point of music is to be GOOD, not just HARD. If you want hard, all you need to do is go outside with a cheap electric guitar and a karaoke machine. turn them both to max, play the lowest key on the bass, and scream as loud as you can. WHOOPDIDOO!! HARDCORE! but GOOD??? NO!Linkin park is not hardcore, but they are GOOD. And that's why this CD is so successful- because people didn't care whether or not it was unoriginal or not hardcore or stupid or simple- they just cared about it being good. This IS good music."
3,4 if not for annoying and POOR rapping,"Catchy rock riffs and great singing by Bennigton make the album. Its no SOAD but it doesnt attempt to be.The rapping has to go though and although unlikely, if the songwriters and Bennigton boot Young MC they'll be much better for it.Not a fan of Limp and talentless Fred but even Durst raps better than this. Its like out of a Taco Bell commercial. Or Blondie's ""Rapture."" (Man from Mars, eating cars gibberish for those born after 1980)"
5,great!,I think this is a great CD. It really has a good beat to it and it's not too trashy like some CD's. It certainly earns 5 stars!
1,POSERS,"This ...is not metal even, though MTV sure thinks it is! These guys arent true to metal, they dont care about what music they play...There is a reveiwer saying thay are death metal, They are as far from deth metal as you can get... THese guys are almost as [bad] as limp bizkit, mixing rap with their so-called metal...Stay away from these posers and listen to real metal like:Cannibal CorpseMetallicaKing DiamondDying FetusCarcassor any of the other great metal bands"
3,"|3.5| Hybrid Theory is a very catchy, mainstream album.","Theres no doubt about it, Hybrid Theory is a purposely radio-friendly and mainstream album, and 90 percent of its fanbase are 15 year old kids. Nevertheless, the tracks on the album are undeniably catchy and addicting. So catchy in fact, that they will be repeating over and over in your head after listening. So if you can stand the whole 'nu-metal' thing, and you don't take this album too seriously, then you'll definently find enough entertainment here. Thumbs up.Best Tracks: ""Crawling"", ""In the End"", ""With You"", ""Runaway"" and ""Points of Authority""."
3,Overrated,"While this is a good CD, it is very overrated In my opinion. Chesters voice is annoying and whiny(its my opinion, dont get mad)and the songs are ok but nothing special. The lyrics are so-so, nothing to compare to band like tool or disturbed. The lyrics usually consist of annoying teen-angst type stuff. I would recommend A perfect circle, their debut album is much better."
5,Perfect,"This album is so Perfect. Just going the make this short and sweet. Favorite tracks are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, and 12. Nothing can ever touch this album. It is destined to go in the hall of fame."
2,too polished with no emotion,Admittedly linkin park write catchy tunes which stick in your head for days on end even though you dont like the song but for me this album is way too polished. The vocals live have alot of emotion live bit on the cd it loses its rawness and becomes weak. Another thing I dislike about this album is the fact the lyrics seem to be the same in every song. The songs all seem to have the same theme about pain and hurt but never get into to much gritty detail like real problems in the world because then the radios wont like that and there songs wont reach the top 10 spot. I think the album is good for kids just getting into music but real music fans will see straight through the polished production and meaningless songs.
5,Nice/Creative,"This is real music, I'm not a disturbed teen. Its rock with mixes to give a new sound with rock. I support this. It started up a new sound for rock."
5,Linkin Park is my new favorite band!!!!,"This cd is great!! I think that all most every song on this cd needs to be a hit. If you like a mix of rock and rap, then you need to get Hybrid Theory!!!"
2,My new favorite band?,"Well, in my opinion, this band is awesome. In a way, they are like a combination of Stabbing Westward, Limp Bizkit and maybe a little Disturbed. These guys are in no way copying these bands, they just sound a little like them. All in all, a really great cd, and if you like any of the above mentioned bands, you might want to check Linkin Park out!"
1,Abe Lincoln>Linkin Park,They should have called this CD Crappy Livejournal Music.Do I even have to say anymore???
1,"This gives me a headache, does anyone have any aspirin?","This is just plain horrible, one star is being too generous. The songs are just horrible and shallow and two-faced. Mellow to heavy worked for Metallica and Nirvana, but for these guys it makes all of rock look bad. Let me tell you something people, not only does this lack talent, this lacks any originality. This is not creative, Linkin Park brings nothing new to the musical table... Rap/rock with a limited (very limited) few exceptions [DISAPPOINTS]! Please do not contribute to the pandemic by buying this. If you have to buy any rap/rock, here are the exceptions...Rage against the machineAnthrax w/Public enemyBody count"
2,I Hate This New Wave of Music!,"Whatever this new wave of music is, I hate it. Bands like Linkin Park, Cleavage and Project Wyze, or however they spell it, all sound the same. All it is is weak verses, with angry and loud courses. Basically after about 3 songs these bands get boring. I did tag on an extra star though because of the strong vocals of one of the lead singers, the blond haired one."
5,::speechless::,"I fisrt heard "" One step closer"" on the radio and was immeadiatly hooked. I then heard papercut and points of authority and had to buy the album. It is fantastic. I cannot stress this enough . BUY IT. there is stuff here for everyone."
2,An ok LP,"this is an overall ok album. they could've cut wit the rappin' ... because it sounded so ... idiotic. I'm not really into the rock but more into the rap game. The thing that caught my mind on this album was the dj, joe hahn. that guy can really lay some damn nice .... i myself am a dj and i am impressed by hahn's great ability. Anyways, if u like the whole rap game try out my niggaz 'Pac, dre, petey pablo, juvenile, trick daddy, or B.i.g. many more niggaz out there i can name but that's a few. shout me a holla if u need a dj for a party. peace."
3,good,this is overall a good cd. it is worth the dollars. i gave it a 3 stars because #11 is so horrible it brings the cd down. I would have given it a 4 without it.
5,Amazing,This is an amazing band who can be listened by people of all ages as they are a heavy metal band that I like and they do not swear so they can be listened by younger children.What I really like about it is that you can make out their words unlike bands like Slip Knot and Korn which also swear heavily. My favourite song on this was Runway.
2,More Like Linkin' Sync,"They have a little talent but it's all washed away by the completely annoying voice of the lead and backup singer. Squeaky. I bet this guy could pass up for a second for one of the backstreet boys. Don't even think about buying it. Go for something real like Staind, Limp Bizkit, or Korn. That's all I have to say about it."
4,But I'm almost 30!,"I actually found myself embarrassed to purchase this album. Despite numerous recommendations from friends and family, I could not overlook that this was just the 'new' sound like Kid and Limp that I don't find myself oozing over, really. And no, I don't own either of those bands. However, now that I own this piece it has found its way consistently into my 4-disc car changer. They have made an outstanding new sound for themselves in an almost-first album release, and I don't doubt the 'next' one will be even more enthralling. Must-buy for the new music hungry. You can compare it to ... well... I find it hard to classify them into another band's sound. Perhaps that is good?"
5,One of the best!!,"Ok, I don't write reviews often, but when a band as good as this comes around I just gotta back them. The blend of rap lyrics with vocals by the lead singer give Linkin Park a different sound from so many other bands that blend the rock/rap genres. I found Linkin Park to be rather refreshing. The content of their songs may not be about socially relevant topics, but with skillful song writing they are emotionally relevant. One of the greatest aspects of music is that people can relate to it; it touches our hearts and exercises (not exorcises) our souls. Like master artists, the band has released an emotionally charged album that expresses human existence. If you're a fan of the rap/rock genre, this album shouldn't disappoint."
5,Wow!!!!!!!!!,"I believe the lead singer (Chester) has the most amazing voice I have ever heard. Track #8 ""In the End"" is the best song on the CD. Of course, the entire CD is incredible. I have heard a lot of music and was a teenager in the mid 80's and let me tell you I have a CD to share with my teenage sister. The lyrics will dig deep into your soul and capture every emotion. These guys are definitely on my favorite list. I read about them and found that they will literally stay after a concert until everyone has a chance to meet them. Wow!!! I'm an instant fan!!!"
4,A great debut album,"Linkin Park has a very interesting sound to them. they are a little mixed in Rap and Scratched tunes...It works sometimes and doesn't on others...Although, you might have heard them already..you should still consider purchasing this album on the grounds that it is different and there are better tracks than the singles you've heard >i.e. in the end and crawling< so if you don't buy it, i think it is still worth one playthrough."
3,Too Pop-like,"In my opion this debut was pretty good. That is until I listened to the songs a few times. Almost every song on the cd sounds the same. ""Cure For The Itch"" is my favorite song overall. The DJ is great in this song. Also, ""Points of Authority"" is my second favorite. Though their demos (""My December"", ""Step Up"", ""High Voltage"", ""Carosuel"", etc.)are so much better, this cd is good for just chilling. I would recommend Dry Cell instead."
5,Linkin Park is Superb,"Linkin Park is a great band. They have a little of everything. They rap sometimes. Then all of a sudden they start to sing. They mix their singing very well. Having 2 singers is a very cool thing in any rock band. All the songs are good on this album. Number 11 is even good, and it's not even a real song. It sounds like a song that should be from some incredible movie. Linkin Park is not just another band. These guys are for real. They sing about everyday things. Not the crap Limp Bizquit sings about. It's finally good to see a band come out that doesn't have a parental advisory sticker on it. Not that I don't like to hear cusswords, but sometimes it just gets old.The only negative thing about the album is that it's only about 38 minutes long. I played it so many times but I haven't gotten sick of it yet. I can't wait till their next CD."
5,Very Proffesional,"This cd by Linkin Park is one of the best I ever bought. The famous singles from this cd is 'Crawling'and 'One step Closer'. There are many other good songs such as 'Papercut' and 'Forgottten'. There are two bonus tracks for Japan but this is sold all over the world. If you put this cd into your computer, It will show you a music video of 'One Step Closer' in very good quality. I hope you buy this cd. It is very good."
5,Simply the best album in history,"I wasn't always a huge fan of LP, but ever since i bought this album, it pretty much changed my life. I listened to the whole albm and realised that i liked all of the songs - which never happened 2 me before to any other cd i bought. I couldn't pick a fav. All of my friends have got this and their my fav band ever now! it's actually 10/5 starz. Believe me you'll regret big time not buying this.and p.s. Chester is hott!"
5,This One Never Leaves My Stereo!,I caught my first glimpse of Linkin Park watching MTVX. I bought it on a chance since I really liked their videos. What can I say other than I have NOT been disapointed! They're an incredibly talented band and I hope they have a long career in the music industry!My 10 year old son is constantly stealing this cd from me and I have to go digging through his room to get it back. He loves it as much as I do!What are you waiting for...pick this up today!
4,"Aweosme CD, WAY OVERPLAYED","Linkin Park's debut CD, Hybrid Theory is an awesome rap/rock CD. Personally I am a huge rap/rock fan. The lyrics for the songs are great and the rapping is also very cool. The best songs on this CD are In The End, Crawling, One Step Closer and With You. I think this CD is great, but like all CD's it has its problems. The songs off of this CD are way overplayed, especially In The End. Also nearly every song on the CD sounds exactly the same. In every one Chester (the lead singer) yells his head off while there is funky rap-music in the background. The lyrics and music is basically the same in all of the songs. All of them start out soft and then get very loud and hard. All in all this is a great CD, but it is not worthy of all the praise it has been getting from radio stations. The songs are great, but just overplayed. If you are a rock/rap fan who wants some great music I reccomend checking out this CD."
4,"rap metal? hell no, LP is its own genre","Everyone who thinks of LP and says O GREAT ANOTHER LIMP BIZKIT is not thinkin about the band, but rather the genre. theyre thinkin about the played out rap/metal scene. I along with everybody else on this planet am sick of all the rap metal bands that can't cut it. LP is one that works and it sounds awesome. I'm not sayin this cd is 100% because it does have its bad tracks, but what album doesn't? The only problem i have with this cd is radio playin it out. If you were to actually listen to the cd without thinkin, AWW IM SO SICK OF RAPROCK then you would appreciate it for what it is, good music. Before you think that i am just another follower of MTV TRL bands, think again, Linking Park is a good band, whatever genre you wanna put em in. ""cure for the itch"" is one of the illest tracks ive heard in years! Alls i gotta say is WATCH OUT FOR REANIMATION, the remix cd is going to kick ass. PEACE!!!"
4,Great cd,This is a good cd in which most of the songs are good.1.Papercut- Fast-paced song and really catchy. one of my favorite songs on the cd.2.One Step Closer- alright song good the first couple times i heard it now sort of annoying3.With You- Pretty good song.4.Points of Authority- alright song don't listen to this one too much.5. Crawling- Great song you'll have it in your head after you listen a couple times.6. Runaway- Another great song one of my favorites7.By Myself- Don't listen to this one much. its not that bad of a song though8.In the End- Great song my favorite song on the cd.9.A Place for my Head- another good song nother one of my favorites.10.Forgotten- good song11.Cure For the Itch- probably the only bad song on the cd12.Pushing me away-good songOverall this is a good cd and you should get it.
5,Awesome CD Im Definetely Buyin The Next,"Linkin Park's debut CD Hybrid Theory is a definete keeper.1. Papercut: Awesome song, sweet opener. 5/52. One Step Closer: sweet song. 5/53. With You: Catchy. 4/54. Points Of Authority: cool song. 4.5/55. Crawling: with hard and soft spots this is a good song. 5/56. Runaway: a runaway sweet song. 5/57. By Myself: a cool song. 4/58. In The End: a very cool song that is hard and soft in places. 5/59. A Place For My Head: SWEETNESS. 5/510. Forgotten: catchy my friend. 5/511. Cure For The Itch: DJ comes alive. 5/512. Pushing Me Away: cool song. 4.5/5"
3,....,"I like this album. It has some good stuff in it. Excelently produced and catchy guitar and drums. It's a 3-star album. There is some good guitar and drums on this album which really attracts me to this album. While I have never been a fan of giving in to trends, I think One Step Closer is a real good song. It is an overall average album, and a good buy if your are into mainstream hardcore."
5,The CD that started it all,This is truly the best CD ever. If you don't have this CD buy it! Reanimation is good too but personally I think Hybrid Theory is better. So if you can only buy one Linkin Park CD make it this one! Linkin Park rocks!!!
4,Linkin Park: The Next Papa Roach?,"As I listened to Hybrid Theory bands started to pop into my head. Papa Roach, Korn, and Limp Bizkit were 3 that showed up quite a bit. But Linkin Park is not just another knock off band. They have an original sound that uses those other bands as a stepping stool, and thats all they use them for. The song ""Papercut"" may sound like a Papa Roach song, but it goes that one little step extra to make it sound original. So if you like Papa Roach, Korn or Limp Bizkit this album is definitely for you. I personally love the album, and would recommend it for anyone."
4,REALLY GOOD!!!!!,"I'm not a big fan of LINKIN PARK, but this HYBRID THEORY is a very good album!!! Besides 1 or 2 songs, all the tracks are great like PAPERCUT, ONE STEP CLOSER, IN THE END, RUNAWAY and PLACE FOR MY HEAD!!!!!"
3,Solid debut album,"This is actually pretty good. I belive the next album will be the keeper,though. Mike Shinoda is the best ""rapper"" of all the nu-metal bands, and Chester Bennington is delightful is his whiny ways."
5,Like Sinking Claws...,"Some may find it too loud, so may find it too morbid, others may simply don't like it; non the less, this band of young geniouses has embarked on the fusion of amazing music genres such as Techno, Rap, Rock and Metal to create something totally new, and deep, very deep.... The lyrics speak out for the modern mind, expresses the trapped feeling that all beings tend to experience; and takes on the side of look from the practical side of emotions. It may be loud, it may be morbid, but it is touching and definitely moving. The mind cannot stay cold against this amazing work of art. To the rebellious minds: get it! To the unexperienced: try it! And to the true modern souls: believe in it!"
1,Disappointing,This album was a big disappoint to me. One Step Closer is a pretty good song but the rest are a totally different style. Some tracks actually sound similar to N' Sync and Backstreet Boy tunes. Too much rapping also. If you are into pop boy bands and rap hip hop then this album is for you. The first song on the track is ok though.
4,THIS CD ROCKS!!!,"if you love hardcore, punky music GET THIS! its one of the best Cds i ever listened too. the only one that i think is better is P.O.D.'s Satelite!!! CHECK THESE 2 GREAT CDS OUT!"
5,Hybrid Thoery = Awesome,"I had only heard 2 songs from Linkin Park, and that was ""One Step Closer"" and ""Crawling"". One of my friends said that I should listen to the whole CD because it's good. He wasn't lying !! This whole album is just awesome. A couple of songs I like are ""Runaway"" and ""Points of Authority"". Definitely an album worth buying !!"
1,linkin biscuit backstreet park boys,Or whatever the name of this substanceless kid-crap mainsteam sell-out college rock band is. This band is to music what Dominos is to pizza. If you're over 16 and you still like this crap then you must think Paris Hilton is the finest model/actress in the country.
2,Its okay,"Ya this CD is okay. Its just really generic nu-metal. I like nu-metal a lot its just some it sounds the same and brings nothing new and that is Linken Park. I don't hate this, I just think it is kind of boring and not that cool. Partially why this does not get 3 stars is that since this band got so big for a while you kind of expect it to be great nu-metal, but its just plain. Not great, not terrible."
1,hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha,"There are exactly three bands that sound awesome with a turntablist. They are:1: Blindspott (A New Zealand band, import there self titled cd if you can.)2: Deftones3: IncubusAny other band who tries to incorporate a turntablist into their music is going to fail miserably plainly because of the high watermark set by the aforementioed bands. Not only do they have much better turntablists, but their lyrics ACTUALLY F*CKING MEAN SOMETHING, it's not just about how painful it is to have millions of record sales and 20 cars in their driveway but their mummy and daddy don't love them. F*ck Linkin Park and any c*nts who try to copy them or listen to them. I'm off to listen to sum real tunes."
1,Waste of money.,"I only spent $9.99 CDN on this CD but even that was a huge waste. This is worse than Meteora and now that they teamed up with a rapper to record their next CD. I have lost all respect for these talentless gays. The guys who play an instrument suck at it. The rapper is bad even for a rapper. Chester can't scream and is a pussy. How did I ever like this pour excuse for music. Don't buy this!!! Want good music? I suggest The Beatles or Pink Floyd. Want good rock? Go for Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Hendrix, or AC DC, want metal? Go for Metallica they rock? Want Punk? Go for Rise against, NOFX, Pennywise, or Bad Religion. Want stuff that's on MTV? Get Blink-182, Sum 41, Green Day and Yellowcard. Want rap? Get better tastes in music! I can't believe I spent almost $30 on this CD and meeotra. It woud have been better spent on that Nirvana DVD.Don't buy this CD. It's not music. Only buy this if it's beside something a lot worse like 50 cent and you REALLY want to buy something."
2,THis cd got so old,"i was the first one to buy this cd back in 2000. My friend told me about them. It was tight until ""in the end"" wa played every ------ hour of the day on the good radio stations. GIve me a break, it gets old and even worse when seriously overplayed on the radio. If your friend offers it, go for 6 bucks or lower."
1,its horrible,They are just another corporate made band that will fizzle out in no time. this record is so bad that i had to return it after listening to the first track!
2,One step closer - to boy bands,"Ughh. They could have been good, but then they tried to be the ""Back Street Boys"" of nu-metal. Another reviewer here suggested that this is a good thing. I guess it would be if you were 13 years old. They have some really good guitar and melodies that are completely sabotaged by Mike Sinoda singing like a girly-man."
1,What was I thinking?,"My original review for ""Hybrid Theory"" I praised Linkin Park for their efforts, up to this day I am not sure why. Rap rock is a genre that should be sedated, crossing them has always produced disgust in me (Limp Bizkit). I should of learned after buying ""Signifcant Other"", but no, I made the mistake of picking this one up as well. Here is a hint for Linkin Park, ditch your horrible MC, trash the DJ and start over. Don't get me wrong, I listen to hip-hop, I am a big techno fan, so I have nothing against either of those two, but this is just horrible."
1,Below average tones with some yelling. Thats Great.,"My title says it all. This thing sucks. These guys have nothing new to offer, very uninovative yelling and chords."
1,Different From What?,"Linkin Park doesn't have much going for them in terms of standing out from the rap-metal pack. Okay, in a way, they do perhaps. They have good taste in indie hip-hop (Kut Masta Kurt, Aceyalone, etc.), and they have a better grasp on melody than, say, Limp Bizkit. But still, weak lyrics, tired sub-Faith No More riffing, and a pretty absent reliance on hip-hop does not a good album make. Linkin Park seem like nice enough guys, and their intentions seem better than (...)Fred Durst and Scott Stapp. Their music, however, just doesn't move me in any way and ends up passing itself off as a Korn imitation only much less vulgar. Nice try, guys."
1,Weak...,"Linkin Park is pretty much pop music. Have a catchy riff, depressing lyrics that relate to troubled teens and add a bit of rap then you have yourself a hit.I admit that the tunes are very catchy and have a nice beat. But that's about it. The mindless screaming and uninspired lyrics really leave something to be desired from this album.I really wish people would come up with something new. Instead of constantly singing about how bad they have it. You think Linkin Park is having problems? Hell, they are rolling in dough because you bought their album! Listen to something with substance and character, instead of mindless ranting about how someones girlfriend broke up with them or how the establishment is bringing them down.I'm not saying people should listen to obscure music or get into artistic rock. But there are plenty of heavy bands that have much more substance then this.Daniel Shelor"
1,I wrote a good review about this peice of crap!?,"When this album first came out, i bought it. I still don't know why. I listend it for 2 weeks, lied to myself and said it was good. I was WRONG!! This is one of the bands thats contributing to the down fall of good music!!! The orignality train missed these guys! Its basicly Limp Bizkit, and The Beastie Boys, mixed with N'sync and Staind. I hope they go far far FAR away!!"
1,DO NOT BUY,This is horrible the biggest piece of rubbish I have ever heard it is record industry ... all hyped up ... The words make little sense at all and pretend to be serious under the guise of singing with passion...Go away and make way for the real artists
1,Hybrid Theory kiss my ass,Papercut- 0/10One Step Closer- 0/10With You- 6/10Points of Authority- 4/10Crawling- 5/10Runaway- 3/10By Myself- 4/10In The End- 6/10Place For My Head- 2/10Cure For The Itch- 2/10this is by far the most over-rated album of all timePushing Me Away- 0/10
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!,this is horrible. you call this music? every song sounds the same! the vocalist just screams and screams. the drummer sounds like a baby banging on pots. the guitars and bass are boring. and the turntablist sucks!!!! too many damn scratches!!!you call these guys talented? you dont know music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Best hard rock band? Come on!,"It's just sad these guys get the best hard rock award in every awards show when there are better bands out there that should have gotten the award. These guys don't even fit in the rock or metal genre. While some of their songs are a little bit of rock, most of the CD fits in the rap/techno genre. They're also more of a boyband. They don't have any talent so they must be a boyband, except a little on the heavy side. To those who like this band, you'll hate them the more you see them on on little kidde channels such as WAM!"
1,Kidnapped Theory,"Underneath a bunch of stolen riffs, copycat-style lyrics and an overall borrowed sound is potentially a very talented band. Unfortunately it seems to have become an industry standard to include songs of angst and depression on every album then release them as a single. Linkin Park play too much on the rock-rap movement that is so big right now. This scene seems to have exploded and other bands seem to jump right on the band wagon. It happened in Seattle and it's happening now. Whilst bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit, RATM and the Deftones paid thier dues and became stalwarts of the rap nu-metal sound, what you have is other bands like Linkin Park, Taproot and Crazy Town riding on and disturbingly cashing in on their success. Like I said, underneath all of these crappy gimmicks like 2 singers and a turntablist lies a decent band I'm sure. Let's hope Linkin Park can find their own orginality and step away from the try-hard Limp sound....sell out anyone?"
3,Hybrid park or linkin theory hmmmm!!!?,"Basically the scoop is that linkin park are a good band which blend a mixture of basic hip hop from mike and chester to uproaring sounds of heavy punkish rock music, no doubts about it I like the band but they are a bit to mainstream for my liking and I realise that these guys will end up with no one liking them anymore so if you like there singles one step closer,crawlin,papercut and in the end buy it. Best song for me is a place for my head and other bands i reccomend are HED P.E oh yeah! sevendust (Cool band) and godsamck."
2,Boring,"This sound has been done to death time to move on. It would be great if a metal band learned to write a song that didn't mumble some whining about ""my reality"". These guys are a little lamer than most. ""I'm crawling in this skin/and the wounds won't heal."" What the hell are they talking about. The heavy metal crowd does more whining than acoustic folkies these days. Pompous, empty and limited musical ability. Some music."
5,linkin parks greatest cd ever!,"hybrid theory is fantastic! its my favorite cd out of all of them. my favorite songs are: in the end, forgotten, and a place for my head. all the songs are extreamly catchy and i get one stuck in my head every day! but the songs are so good i dont even care that they're in my head! chester has amazing vocal skills and mikes rapping skills are unbeleavible! plus they have a varity of different types of music like, rock,rap i could go on and on. so if you like that kind of stuff i would deffenetly reccomend this cd. its flawless! in other words its the greatest cd ever! ~taylor~"
5,Truly a multi-genre band,"3 and a half years ago, I popped into a Sanity music store and bought this album. I had just started listening to music, and ""Hybrid Theory"" was the first album I had ever bought.Now, in 2004, after trying out hundreds upon hundreds of artists of almost all genres, ""Hybrid THeory"" remains the most played album in my stereo.WHy? Because Linkin Park was once unique. Their mixture of pop, rock, metal, hip-hop, and techno really revolutionised mainstream music, bringing together the commendable qualities from all realms of music. Each song is clear in delivering a message, whilst maintaining a heavy, melodic, depressing/psychedelic, and emotional tone.Truly, in my opinion, one of the greatest albums of all time. If you consider Linkin Park ""nu-metal"", then the only competitors in that arena would be Papa Roach and Staind."
3,Linkin Park,Linkin Park arent that great with their repetive guitar hooks and predictable lyrics this is the perfect band for anyone under the age of 15 although LP do have their moments where you can see flashes of brilliance although those moments are often limited In The End and One Step Closer would have to be those moments but after those songs it seems that everything sounds the same.......CAUTION avoid Meteora at all costs it is the same old as Hybrid Theory
1,It's official...I hate Linkin park,"For a time there, I loved them. Then I liked them. Then I sold the CD and was like ""they're kind of good, but not for me"". But now I hate them. This is not rock, nor rap. Where's the originality in today's music? Where are the guitar solos, or inventive lyrics? And why do they make awful videos? Crawling is like the worst song ever. Techno/rock/rap? God, no. It needs more substance, more thought, more energy. It comes off as boring and there are a million better bands. And when a genre-bending band like Lostprophets can efficiently make good music, why bother with Linkin Park? Please...stay away from this."
3,Best seller of 2001!,Limkin Park iz a really good band that isn't trying to copy Limp Bizkit or anyone else. I like Limp Bizkit and have his albums also. Come on why else would this be the top selling album of the year??? BUY IT!!!
5,Kick _ ss CD!,"I'm 38 and I take exception to teens saying that I would not like this CD. I love it, my nephew has gotten me into Staind and Linkin Park among others, and Linkin Park is now my favorite CD, I play it every where. I say if you ever liked Rock and Roll, rather it be Led Zepplin in the 70's or Van Halen in the 80's, then I can't see anyone suddenly not liking today's Rock. It is all Rock and Roll. I will be rocking when I'm 80!! (and not in a rocking chair)."
4,Good music.,"So Linkin Park is in the same genre as, say, Limp Bizkit and those types of artists. But their music is so very different. For one, they don't swear. Call me a prude, but I have more respect for an artist that can make an album without swearing. And unlike a lot of the ""music"" with little but screaming vocals and loud guitars, Linkin Park actually has a melody. You can hear it on all of their singles and on most of the tracks. They have their fair share of screaming vocals and loud guitars also, but it's more than that.The album is good to blast when you're in a foul mood, but is also good for just plain listening. It's worth buying."
