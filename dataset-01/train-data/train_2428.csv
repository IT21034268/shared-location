1,"""Pure Drivel""","Not a scholarly (or even incisive)look at Machiavelli, but rather an insightful look into the pseudologic and agenda of the always garrulous right-wingers.Ledeen should heed the warning of one woman in politics (a group he utterly neglects in his treatise):""In politics, if you want anything said, ask a man; if you want anything done, ask a woman.""--Margaret Thatcher"
5,A brilliant - and delightful - essay on politics,"This brilliant -- and delightful -- essay should be read by everyone who is even remotely interested in public affairs. If you like where our country is going -- read this book to learn why you are wrong. If you are appalled by where our country is going -- read this book to learn what must be done to get back on track. Whatever your view, surely we can all agree that there is no substitute for effective leadership. Through the writings of Machiavelli, Michael Ledeen shows what leadership really is all about. And boy, oh boy, can he write."
4,Read the Republic of Plato before this book.,"Be careful, advocates of Machiavelli! Make sure you have the right dosage of philosophy. The best knowledge is the knowdedge of right and wrong. The best rulers are phylosophers. Although Machiavelli would sure help one in the power game, without the knowledge of right and wrong, the worst scenario could be a self-fufilling prophecy.Over all, a good highlight of Machiavelli's points. Either because of typo or omission, some quotes do not clearly indicate sources. e.g. page 4 of papater back edition,isbn-0-312-26356-2."
2,Problem with warranty,"Continued from my earlier review - after having several problems with my Lexmark printer I took it to the retailer, but they said they could no longer send it back to Lexmark despite the fact the LEXEXPRESS warranty states the printer will be repaired or exchanged. I was given a number to call, which gave the same directions as the manual for troubleshooting, which we already tried. I emailed Lexmark and they refuse to take the printer back for repairs or to replace it. I am so upset they will not fulfill the warranty.I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau."
2,Terrible Customer Service!!,"I bought my Lexmark Z42 last November. I was told at the time it has the LexExpress Warranty, so if it stopped working I could take it back to the retailer and Lexmark would ship a replacement printer to me. Well, it has had numerous problems in the last two or three months such as stalling during print jobs and paper jams and misfeeds. A couple times I tried to print and my computer froze and had to be restarted, etc. We hooked it up to my husband's computer and it did not work there either. ... This is the LAST Lexmark product I ever buy. ...Instead I have had the inconvenience of finding other means of printing my documents and photographs."
5,used is good,"i have looked all over for this printer, thank you so much for being there.all is good now. thanks again every thing i have looked for and then went to amazon.comfor it i found it. everything has been as described and at very good prices.keep up the good work. r smith"
2,It is cheap for a reason!,"The ink cost more than the printer! Although it is rather fast for the price and was pleased with it initially, we now have problems with it. It locks up the computer and often won't even print. This may be a problem somewhere else in the system, but either way, the cartridges for this thing are so [] expensive you might as well save the money and buy a more expensive printer with cheaper cartridges. i would not recommend this to anybody! it is a stupid buy. ... With that amount of money, we could have bought a brand new photo printer. As a matter of fact, when it came to buy ink for the second time in a few months, we said forget and bought a whole new printer, a canon..."
4,Good book.,"I think this book is pretty creative in teching your young one numbers. Right now, my son is not paying to much attention to it. But, maybe he will later."
4,good,"IT's a cute Clifford paperback. I bought it to help teach my 2 year old about numbers, but the book is more about actual counting. It will be great once he's ready to count items on a page. The book asks questions similar to ""How many yellow balls...?"" ""Count all of the purple presents..."", for example."
4,Traditional Values,"Moshe Chaim Luzzatto's The Path of the Just has a bit of something for everyone. A deeply traditional book, it expounds some of the basic tenants of Rabbinical Judaism like reward and punishment, stark dualisms between God and the world, body and soul, spirit and matter. For many, this will be an immediate turn off; Luzzatto is preaching a line that many modern people no longer buy. And more often than not, Luzzatto can be a harsh moralist.That said there are interesting ideas here for the modern searcher in Judaism. His concepts about separation are particularly profound. In a religion that stresses communal values, he sees the value of being alone in order to detach oneself from the world, to seek the divine. Luzzatto's monkish values may not be for everyone, but in a connected world, where we always have to seek something outside of ourselves, learning how to be disconnected is good ballast."
4,complete for the price,"Maybe the most complete book on Frank Lloyd Wright but despite the numerous photos, the quality is equal to the price. Some pictures like Guggenheim Museum are quite poor. Despite this it's a good book especially for the price."
3,Okay but several photos are reversed,Several photos are reversed in the paperback edition sold here. Very sloppy if you asked me (but it is cheap.) Otherwise some nice photos.
1,Another poor title from Mr. Heinz,"Many rave reviews of books by Mr. Heinz seem to be ""ringers"", perhaps written by the publisher or Mr. Heinz himself. How can you tell a ""ringer""? Just by clicking on the reviewers name (like ""Dave Anderson"" below) and discover that the only review he has written in seven years is for Mr. Heinz's book! Coincidence? Another favorite is to plant one from ""a reader"". Be wise, people!"
1,It's junk,The idea behind this product is great. But the design is very poor.The plastic turn studs with which you adjust the height of the risers are so poor they will break after a few uses. They will break.Or they will break off right in the carry bag unless you are really careful not to bump the set.The price and resulting quality of this product is just way too low.Better pay 3X and get a Lowel or equivalent system that won't break on you almost immediately.
2,Fair product,"It's not a bad stand, except for the fact that the second time I used it, one of the little pegs that holds the crossbar snapped in two, therefore rendering the stand useless."
3,"Okay for fun, really already known information","This book is a humerous way to keep the nervous groom occupied. It's take on everything from choosing a ring to planning the big event are laid out in a easy to understand, fun format.Though this book is informative and fun, a lot of the information is really already known to the saavy groom to be. This book was helpful for an occasional resourece, and to keep me occupied. My wife wouldn't let me do anything that had to do with the planning of the wedding, so at least by reading this book I felt involved."
2,For unserious grooms,"This book does not give advice on how to help the bride, it makes fun of the whole wedding planning experience, and tells the groom what not to do, and this is not helpful. Whoever thinks that this book is written for a groom that wants to help, is kidding themselves."
5,Brand new DVD,"The price was terrific on this brand-new DVD. These Wild West Tech shows are all interesting, and this one told about different mining methods in the old days. I would recommend this seller to anyone."
2,At least they're amusing to the recipient,"These cards only come 12 in a box. While the front of each card, as pictured, shows four Worst Case situations, the interior shows only one. While it is conceivable that variations exist, I sorted through a number of boxes, and found only 'How to Escape Reindeer Attack.' This product, while amusing to the recipient, is not, in this reviewer's opinion, worth the money."
4,Not the normal Holiday card.,"Comes with 12 cards, each with ""How to escape reindeer attack"" inside them. Funny!"
3,Gave it away,"The camera case is very well made and The Sony website recommended this case for my DSC-W300. This case does have a light snap on the front unlike some that close with a magnet, but I found that the case seemed a bit on the small side for my camera. I felt like the case would come undone if not carried very carefully. The drawback for me is that the case itself did not have a strap, the strap included is for your camera. If your on the run with just your camera like I often am I had no place to put or hold the case when the camera was out of it. I ended up buy another slimfit leather case (red) that has 2 slots to hold extra memory sticks, the camera fits better and it has a small leather strap to carry it."
3,Stylish and somewhat protective,"I wanted a pink case to match my DCS-T70 cyber-shot. In the description it didn't say that it was compatible with my camera model, but it still fits well. For the price, I was expecting it to protect my camera in case it fell, but the pamphlet enclosed with the carrying case said that ""It cannot protect your camera from strong impact or pressure."" So basically, it just protects the camera from scratches. Also, the color of the case was a little darker than I was expecting. The bottom line is that you're paying for the style of the case and not the protection."
4,Decent camera case.,"This is a decent case. Genuine leather. Good quality. But a little bit pricy. Hey, you got a ""Sony"" brand name. That's what u pay for"
2,canera case,Great sturdy case for my sony camera!! Love the color and also matches my pink camera but good for my silver camera as well.
3,review,"This book is amazing! If you want to understand our relationship with the Lord more clearly in relation to Him being the vine and us being the branches, I definately recommed this book!"
4,Champions:the New Milennium,This is a good basic role playing book for role playing Super-heros. It is not for the new role player but for a role player stepping out of the basic fantasy role playing games and looking for a new Adventure.
2,Where is the action,"If you have a serious facial or cranial injury, the place to be is the Madison Facial and Cranial Surgery center. However, butchered bodies are showing up around the area and its bringing out the big guns - such as the FBI.One FBI guy knows instantly who is responsible. The Prince of Darkness, who was supposed to have been killed two years ago.While the premise of this book sounds exciting, the writing is not. The author writes in a down to earth manner, but for some reason, spends page after page describing and/or introducting yet another character.This book is deep in characters and very little on plot and action. Although I get the impression the author was trying to flesh out the characters, the end results is that we get bogged down in the number of characters and we get bored by the little activity there is.While this is not a horrible read, there just isn't much action in this book."
3,Not so happy,I purchased two of these--I returned one because it was damaged during shipping-very little packaging material. I received the a replacement pretty quickly--bu there was a separation in the wood on the top of he lid. I like the look of the boxes but would not order them again. I did not bother to return the second one--I was remodeling my kitchen and by the time I open the packaging it was too late to return it anyway.
3,"Great potential, but not so great construction","We are avid tea drinkers (and coffee drinkers too) and we wanted to tea box to organize our teas, while still having them be easily accessible. This tea box almost hits the mark; however, the construction was not the best. First, our box does not close properly due the bamboo being warped. To fix this, we have been leaving a heavy bowl of fruits on top and that appears to be working. Also, the chain does get in the way of tea stored in that compartment, but all of our tea bags seem to fit just fine in the allotted spaces. Next time I would order a box that can be clasped shut."
1,Save your money,"I thought this was the perfect solution to tidying up my kitchen counter, but was sadly disappointed when the product arrived. Three of the four screws that attached the hinges to the box were pulled out and could not be screwed back in (the holes were too large). And the compartments are indeed too small for all but one brand of tea bags that I use. Overall, the box did not seem very well made and I ended up sending it back for a refund, which Amazon promptly provided."
4,nice tea chest,"I was pleased with this product. It is attractive, compact and well-constructed. The only thing I don't like is that some tea bags today are too big for the compartments. I have to cut the packets down to get them in."
1,Bamboo tea storage box,I ordered two. One came with a crack in the lid and the other a different color wood stain (or maybe it was glue?) was used on the inside back wall of the box. They were both very poor quality although nice looking.
4,Well Worth the Price,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my mother. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the product. It seems to be very well made, and the finish is much nicer than it looks in the picture. I expected it to be more of an unfinished wood, but it has a beautiful, glossy shine. I purchased tea bags and filled the box, and had no trouble with any of the different varieties of bags fitting in."
2,2 boys + ice cream maker ball = broken ice cream maker ball,It can and will crack apart especially if you are playing over a tile floor.It lasted maybe 3-4 times of making icecream.
1,Seriously??,"send your spouse to the store, spend 5 bucks on a ben & jerrys while you roll a ball around w/your kids. problem solved. no mess, no cleanup, no $20 ball and $10 in ingredients, everyone is happy. who invented this sloppy mess? it's a disaster!"
2,Making Ice Cream,"The recipes that came with the Play and Freeze sound really good. I used one of them. Hmmm, my husband and I rolled and passed and stirred, then we rolled and passed, added more ice and salt and rolled and passed and stirred, then added more ice and salt. Then, we passed and rolled... Anyway, it took almost an hour to get ice cream. And it was still very soft in the middle. Not a lot of fun."
4,Lots of fun,My 10 year old son and I had a great time making ice cream with it. It works quite well!
2,Not so good,1. Too heavy and hard for the kids to toss around. Like throwing a big rock around2. Took a lot longer to make than the directions stated.3. Too much work for the amount and quality of ice cream you get
5,Cool Cool Cool,I gave this as a gift. My friend just loved it. We will now have ice cream on the boat this summer.
3,"Fun, but a few drawbacks","This is a super idea and a lot of fun but there are a few drawbacks. It takes 15 minutes in 2 intervals to roll the thing, and time seems to pass slowly on that second pass. I did it with 3 children, and all of our attention spans waned. And unless you really keep the momentum going, it doesn't freeze all the way so you have to eat runny ice cream or roll for a bit longer. The ball itself is also very hard so you have to be careful if you are doing this with kids. But all the flavors you can create are a lot of fun, and it's a great concept."
1,Mega ball Ice cream maker,This product doesn't work. We rolled and played with this ball for 45 minutes and there was still no ice cream. Not even a little frozen. I wouldn't suggest buying this product. We were so excited to roll and have fun making ice cream. My kids were very sad whne it didn't work!!!!
4,Surprisingly good,My daughter asked for this for her 8-yr old birthday. She and her siblings can use it with no adult involvement required to make ice cream. It's simple and requires exercise and a friend to use. We're sold. The small batch size limits portions to a reasonable amount.Don't buy this thinking to make ice cream for a party. It's labor intensive and makes 1 quart only. Those are both good and bad features.
3,Makes Better Ice Cream than my Cuisinart,"Makes better ice cream than my new Cuisinart. I happen to LIKE that it only makes a small amount of ice cream. I don't want to make a huge batch of ice cream to take up space in my freezer, tempt me into eating it everyday, or get forgotten about and go to waste. I like that I can try a new recipe and make a small amount to sample. We enjoy it for dessert and then it's gone, no taking up space in the freezer or tempting me the next day. We use it in the living room, the kids enjoy rolling the ball around, so zero work for me there."
2,Great idea in theory...,"This ice cream ball seemed like a good idea at the time... in reality it was fun to try but definitely not something to do on a regular basis. First of all the ball is hard and dangerous! you cant drop it or throw it and if you toss it back in forth to a partner you have to be very careful not to knock their teeth out! The outside should be made of squishy rubber that can be dropped on the ground. Rather the whole process consisted of us rolling the ball back and fourth on the floor and then taking turns shaking it. It took about 20 min and the ice cream was pretty good, but hard to scoop out of the container. It took up a good hour and a half between preparing the recipe, filling the ball and shaking the ice cream so if you need a game at a party or cookout this may be the ice cream ball for you!"
2,Disappointed,"My older daughter bought this for my 14-year-old, and we were really disappointed. We got the bigger model, and tossed it for 30 minutes. After tiring out with that, we rolled it back and forth for 15-20 minutes. The ice cream was still runny, so we put it in the freezer overnight. It was solid, but icy."
2,too fragile,"We purchased this item to play with on our camping trip and ended up playing with it in the house with carpet floors, we were about 3 feet apart and one of the girls were trying to catch it and it dropped out of her hands and it broke or cracked. If it hit the ground at all while outdoors anywhere there would have been a real mess. One time use throwing it very carefully and easy, and it is no longer usable. It was fun while it lasted...."
3,Made ice cream on the first try- heavier than expected,"We tried this out over the fourth of July weekend and made some good vanilla ice cream. When I ordered this, I have thought that we would be able to stand around the yard or on the beach and toss the ball back and forth to make the ice cream. The fact is that the ball ends up being heavy once the ingredients are inside. We tossed it some but were afraid that if we missed and it hit the ground that it would come open and the ingredients would pour out. We ended up rolling it back and forth some and held it and jumped around. My family ended up losing interest because it was taking some long and I ended up shaking it trying to get it to make. It took more than an hour but we ended up with ice cream. It was neat to have made it ourselves but it did take much longer than expected. I'm not sure how often we will use this."
3,Loads of noisy fun!!,"We really enjoyed playing with this ball although it made a lot of noise rolling on the floor. We rolled it on carpet to reduce the noise, but still a lot of rattling from the ice inside. We forgot that you have to stop and stir your ice cream occasionally and it only froze around the outside of the cylinder. We had more of a milk shake when we were finished. I imagine openning it repeatedly would get a little messy.This is certainly not for making lots of or very creamy ice cream. However, it is lots of fun and took me back to the days of making ice cream in coffee cans rolled across Mom's kitchen floor. This is a lot of fun for families. Makes enough for a family of 4 to share for a treat. Just don't plan on watching a movie while rolling your treat.Good time. :)"
5,had a ball with the ice ball.,"this was a good ice cream ball. all grandchildren and Big ones kick,roll,throw andpast ball until it got heavy .Ice cream was goooooood."
1,didn't work well,"My daughter received this as a gift for Christmas last year. She used it two times, and it started to leak when you rolled the ball. Also, our kids got tired of rolling the ball for the length of time needed to make the ice cream. We would not recommend this."
4,What a fun way to make ice cream!,I had a feeling this would be a hit with my daughter in college...and it was!!! She had so much fun making ice cream & it tasted great!
2,O.K.,"Heavy, Heavy, Heavy. Very over priced and very hard to extract the ice cream from. And actually dangerous if handled by children with to much strength."
2,"Fun idea, poor excecution","Got it all set up, and ended up leaking out where you put in the cream and such. ENded up returning it."
5,Excellent.,PErfect for home or while camping. Simple ingredients to make a batch of great ice cream. Fun for whole family as you roll or toss it arround.
5,They screamed for Ice Cream!,My nephew screamed with joy after opening this present. It was fun to not only make the ice cream but then eat it. And looking at all the fun different flavors you can make was very cool. This was a big hit for the whole family and I am the aunt of the year!
5,Birthday Party Blast !!!,"We LOVE this product! I had seen it advertised earlier this year in a toy catalog, but was convinced to buy it for my daughter's 9th birthday after seeing it favorably reviewed by Consumer Reports. My two daughters thoroughly enjoyed making this batch of birthday ice cream (and probably offset most of the calories it contained in the process :>). The ice cream tasted great, and prep and cleanup were both easy-breezy. I will be giving this item as a birthday present to many others. Thank you again for this fun food innovation-keep them coming!"
1,Not Enough Fun for the Frustration,"I used mine once and returned it because the work of it outlasted the fun by at least 20 minutes. The ice cream was really hard to remove, too. Even though we followed the instructions, we had ice milk in the core and hard ice cream on the wall of the interior.If we were camping and really wanted ice cream, we'd probably use it once or twice a year. It's a cute idea, but the work and frustration of it doesn't pay off."
5,We luv'd this thing,We took this to our company picnic and followed the directions that came with it....shazam!!! it was like having a gourmet dessert in 15 minutes from scratch! We'll be using it at our next picnic.....I just may get another so we have enough for the whole family. (We like alot of ice cream)
4,"Don't toss, kick or throw!","I was a little surprised at the warning when I first read the instructions, but once you fill the MEGA ball with Ice you really won't want to toss, kick or throw this thing anyway. It's 9lbs when filled. Plus the plastic is hard and I imagine would crack of you drop it on another hard surface, or worse it would crack bones in your foot if it landed on it. Even so it was great fun passing and shaking the ball. We used the Strawberry Rival ice cream mix packet along with a mixture of heavy cream, half and half and milk. YUMMY. Took 30 minutes total to freeze. I would recommend the smaller ball for smaller children to help with, even though that is 7lbs filled - still a bit heavy."
3,It's OK,It makes good ice cream but it definitely takes more work than you might think. The kids finally got tired of rolling it around so the adults had to take over but in the end the ice cream was pretty good.
4,Fun product,My children have fun with this and they can make small batches of their favorites! They can also clean it. I don't have to do much with it since it is so child friendly.
5,Lots of fun for a bunch of kids,"I got this for my daughter's birthday as the Bratz ice cream maker she got only made about 2 scoops of ice cream. This makes a whole quart and I had my Girl Scout troop throw it around and there was more than enough for all of them to have an ice cream cone. They loved it. It's a lot easier if you have a group, my girls took turns but they certainly earned their cones. I will do it with my Cub Scout troop when we are camping. This is a great, simple item!"
2,Should be easier.....,"Seems easy enough....but it isn't. It takes a lot of time, and a lot of shaking, and it leaks. Not exactly what we was hoping for...."
3,Wrong Color Ice Cream Ball Maker,The ice cream maker was suppose to be Blue but instead it was Red.I already have the red one. was a Christmas gift for my grandaughter.
3,Was dropped and Broken,"Not very durable considering that you give it to kids to throw around. My kids were playing with it on a concrete pool deck, dropped it, and it broke. Not fixable."
4,loved it!,"We love this! Bought it for my son and his friends as a summer boredom distracter - & it worked perfectly! They kicked it around like a soccer ball, tossed it playing hot potato and used it to bowl down empty soda cans in the yard. Kept them busy and happy and then rewarded them with yummy ice cream. Wish it made more in a batch though."
2,Not what I had hoped for.,"I really was looking for a small ice cream maker. This product was small so, that fit the the bill. It took a lot longer to make the ice cream then the instructions said. It was hard to get the hardened ice cream off the sides of the can.All in all, it was a great idea but, not what I had hoped for."
2,ice cream blue ball,After following directions found the ball leaked on the carpet during which time it was being rolled back and forth. Not worth 27.00! Would not buy again.
4,Super Fun,"I would give it a 5-Star, but it definitely takes work.... Adding more ice, stirring the contents, adding more salt. Shake -a-shake-a-shake. I bought it for my little girls 4th birthday party. IT WAS GREAT!!!!! All the little children sat at safe distances from eachother and cooperatively played the game of roll the ice-cream balll... They loved the idea of making it themselves. When they lost attention with it I gave it to the group of adults left in the room and I beleive it worked even better for them. They were laughing and giggling in childish play.I love it, but if you want to use it more often with only a couple people then I would have to recommend the smaller version. Less time involved and less adding and stirring necessary."
4,I wish it was bigger :),Worked great for the kids. The only problem we had was that is wasnt enough. All three of my kids fought over the ice cream. Of course we made more but it just wasnt fast enough. My advice is to buy big soft cookies so they can make ice cream sandwiches and then they wont fight over wanting a BIG bowl full. Enjoy. We really do like it.
2,Ice cream ball,"The ice cream was great! Now for the down side of it...The seal on the side the cylinder opened to would leak during use, it took what seemed forever to make the ice cream (thirty minutes for the mega size; if you have dogs that like to chase things that might make it more enjoyable between two people), and it took lots of ice. It would be good for someone to do at home, however, not my idea of a good item to take camping unless you're in a motorhome with an ice maker and space to store it...would be good for kids if you could come up with different ways of moving the ball around besides throwing/tossing it."
5,Play & Freeze Ice Cream Ball a Big Hit!,"Thank you Onlinecomponents! I received my first Ice Cream Ball only two days after I ordered it on Amazon. I took it camping with my family as a suprise about a week later. My two little boys were memorized with the ball, and after about 20 minutes of playing around in the grass, we all shared some of the best homemade ice cream I have ever tasted! My family enjoyed it so much that I came back to ordered the new MEGA ball and can't wait to try it. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who loves fun and ice cream -what a treat!"
3,Made great ice-cream but it took a whole team to do it!,"We used two of these to make ice cream for my brother and sisters birthday parties this year. The end product was great, however it took almost every attendee to make the ice cream. This is not a short process. It was kind of fun though, we would each have the ball for a few minutes, shake it up and pass it on. I'd say it took us a good 20 minutes to make the ice cream. I guess we burned off what we ate by making it! :)"
3,HEAVY,"It's a fun idea, but can be made with household items (like two coffee cans). The ball is really heavy when filled and not so easy to roll around."
3,harder than anticipated,This was quite a novelty (at least at first until it got a bit tedious). All our ice had melted before even half the time passed so we had to do an emergency trip to buy more. You need A LOT of ice! We also found it really hard to get the icecream out of the container.
4,Roll gently!,Pretty fun. Made a ton of ice cream. It did leak a little bit unless we rolled it in one direction- so no throwing this guy about (too heavy) or rolling willy nilly.
4,Super fun,My grandkids used the ball for the first time to make ice cream for their grandfather's birthday party. It worked great and was lots of fun. Highly recommended!
1,Not so great,"After a lot of shaking and rolling, the ice cream was rock solid and impossible to get out of the container. The ice cream was full of ice crystals and tasteless. Threw the product out after one use."
3,Ice cream maker,Purchased this ice cream maker for Christmas. Thought it would be fun but it took a little over 40 min to make ice cream and then we had a heck of a job getting it out of the container. Frozen so hard and weird shape so couldn't get a tool in to remove ice cream. You also have to stop halfway through and scrape down sides. Ice cream tasted great but design is poor. We have done the same kind of thing with 2 coffee cans and works better. Kids became bored pretty quickly. Will be good for camping.
4,Mmmm! Just follow directions!,"Here's the basics:- The ice cream came out delicious. I made mine with 1 part heavy whipping cream, and 1 part half and half so it was creamy and the consistency was lovely. The two varieties I've made are chocolate chip/blackberry ice cream, and peach ice cream-- both were great.- FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS. Most of the bad reviews seem to be because people didn't follow the directions. You have to stop and scrape the sides, add some ice, and continue throwing the ball back and forth for another 8-10 minutes. For those who said they couldn't get the top off, there is a tool that they provide you with if the lid gets too tight. Just read the very short instructions and you should be fine.- Probably not great for small kids. My boyfriend and I made ice cream with this when we went camping. I have the pint-size one, and it was pretty heavy throwing it back and forth. It wasn't very difficult, but if you dropped it on your foot or didn't catch it right, it would hurt."
2,I have a better idea!,I have a much better idea. Go to your local grocery store and buy a pint of ice cream. There you go! And my advice cost you nothing!
1,Kids lost interest fast,"We rolled this ball around for almost 30 minutes, and we ended up with soupy ice cream. The cencept sounds like fun, but my group of ten year olds lost interest fast. I ended up putting the ice cream mix in my Cusinart ice cream maker to finish the job. I would not recommend the ice cream ball."
1,Big Let Down,"While the idea behind this product is fun and creative, the execution is awful and thats what really matters to those who buy this. The ball is extremely heavy when filled (7 pounds!) The drum inside does not hold much liquid (only 2 cups total) and the ball is made from a heavy plastic with thick ridges on the outside. Unfortunately you have to shake or roll the ball and after the first 10 minutes our hands were red and hurting! They really should have made the outside smooth. The seal on ours did not hold the liquid from the melting ice so water was flying everywhere as we shook the ball even after pouring out the melted ice! All in all we were not satisfied after trying two batches."
2,Ok Ice Cream but not much fun!,"This was a Christmas gift and we used it on Christmas day, following the instructions carefully, after over 30 mins the ice cream was still not fully set although did taste nice anyway. the ball was a little leaky during the shaking process and needed to be held in a tea towel, and was very noisy so made discussion difficult. When full it is rather heavy so littlepeople will struggle if they are required to fo it for long... all in, unlikely it will be used again! Have to say - the science is still cool though!"
3,cheap,"Not durable needs do be made from a polymer, that would keep it from cracking. Can't roll it on any surface you wish, probably explode if you tried."
2,Ice Cream Disaster,"This product is heavy when in use, so you can't toss it, and it is over an hour's work for about a pint of ice cream... This isn't a great gift and can smash fingers... I would think twice before buying this, because my 3 kids hate it."
4,This Ice Cream is REALLY GOOD!,What a fun way to make ice cream! I made ice cream with my son and his friend. We had a ball (literally and figuratively speaking). We rolled and talked and rolled and chuckled until the ice cream was ready.It was absolutely fun and delicious.Be prepared however...it will take about 20 mins.Enjoy!
3,"Um hey pro wrestler, could you please open this?","Ok so my sister and I have put in every single ingredient and we are playing with the ball outside, in my mind i'm thinking, wow after we eat i'm going to write a great review of this thing. So we've played with it for the first 15 min and we go inside to open it. I go to open and I can't. Then I call in my mom and she can't. So back and forth we are trying for like 10 min. And the stupid wrench tool, it does not work in any way. So now we have to wait for my dad to get home to get it open and by then my fruit sorbet will just be juice."
3,A little disappointed...,"Bought this for my 12 year old daughter. She had fun with it, and it worked just like it was supposed to. What I didn't like about it was that it leaked."
3,Cheaper at Walmart,I recently purchased this same item a few weeks ago at Walmart for $12.00. It was on clearance though. Make sure you look there first!
3,a letdown,"I admit I'm a big fan of ice cream. Not only because I like running to the ice cream man with money in my hand, but also using ice cream to make myself a HUGE cup of a delicious chocolate milkshake for desert. Yummy! This ice cream maker doesn't quite make the ice cream as tasty as the stuff you buy in grocery stores. This ice cream is VERY sweet and will immediately fill you up after you've eaten just a little bit of it. Then again, maybe my tongue can't appreciate sweets as much as most people. If you don't consider yourself someone who can handle a lot of sweet food, beware."
2,"But, really:","OK, so it makes a pint of mixed review ice cream and it's allegedly fun to use, but really, $35 ?????. I don't think so."
1,Terrible Review,"I ordered this product as a Christmas Present on the 22nd and paid overnight shipping, it did not come until JANUARY 15th. I have contacted this company to try and at least get refunded on shipping with no response. I will never order from Amazon again, because you really don't know who your ordering from. Amazon takes no responsiblity for the companies they let sell on their website."
1,A coffee can will do the same thing.,"Save your money. We made ice cream in Girl Scouts by filling a coffee can with ice and rock salt and putting a smaller can inside that with the ice cream ingredients. That won't cost you anything or if it does, at least you get coffee. You can use any two air tight containers and put on in the other."
3,play & freeze,"The first pint of ice cream took a long time- your arms get pretty sore. On the second pint, my son dropped it (accidentally) from about 3 feet up. It is now ruined (illustrating how heavy it really is). If I knew who to appeal to, I would try to get a free replacement, and CERTAINLY to suggest adding rubber strips to all the hard edges. This would make it MUCH more durable and keep the damp exterior from slipping through cold and icy fingers."
2,Not as fun as they say,This is a great idea in theory. It doesn't take 10mins like the directions say. It takes about 45 mins and you need to keep adding ice and salt. My kids lost interest after about 15 min and I ended up rolling the thing around the house until I gave up and stuck the whole thing in the freezer to finish the job. For as much work as this thing takes you don't get much ice cream as a reward. I'd rather pay $5.00 and buy some ice cream.
1,"Interesting idea, but poor results","I liked the idea of this product:add the ingredients, roll it around, check, roll some more and voila...soft serve ice cream. After following the directions, including the draining, scraping down the mixture, and adding more ice and salt, and rolling some more, the ice cream was still very soupy. So, we rolled some more BUT the results were not what we wanted. The ice cream that was on the outside of the cylinder froze into a firm consistency, but it was very difficult/awkward to scrape it into the center of the cylinder where the soupy stuff was. At the end, I was scraping the good stuff off of the cylinder with my fingers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh well... I returned the product."
2,"imagine ""playing with a bowling ball""","I don't understand how this thing has so many good reviews!Don't expect to throw or kick this around. It is hard plastic filled with heavy ballast. I'm not sure why they made the external portion with all the grooves because it's difficult to even roll.A friend bought this for my kids. They were sorely disappointed in this thing and my friend was embarrased. Maybe my kids are too little? both under 10. I was worried about them dropping the ball and it shattering-or worse, landing on a toe.It made ok soft icecream after 2 adult men tossed it short distances. it was a pain to fill and a pain to clean."
1,"Don't, it was NO FUN!","Too heavy, took long time, kids lost interest, had to use pliers to remove seal."
4,Great for expirementing and sampling,"As a very ""unreasonable"" reviewer already stated, it has a very small capacity. I purchaced it for my husband who is a chef and was working in a fine dinning restaurant at the time. He LOVED this because it enabled him to hone his ice cream making skills. He was able to test new flavors and tecniques without having to worry about large loss of product. More importantly, it was fun. He'd prep it out as soon as he got there and then let the servers play with it and send it on break with people. By the time they had their meal break, they had a brand new, hard earned ice cream to sample! If they liked it they'd make a large batch.Only bad thing I can say, is that someone dropped it on the concrete and it shattered. I think that's to be expected though."
5,Good fun,"My daughter (age 8 at the time) truly enjoyed making and eating this. She and her cousins bounced it around for a while, with me sitting there waiting for it to explode (it did not), and very shortly after had very creamy, good-tasting ice-cream. My only beef with it is that there wasn't quite enough for everyone."
2,Not A Fan,"Concept is great but product is heavy,messy and my ice cream would not freeze (?) Had to put it into a container to thicken. Shook this thing around for about an hour. I'm too lazy for this!"
4,works as promised,"I bought this ice cream maker so my grandchildren and I could have something fun to do together. We've only used it once, following the directions for the vanilla ice cream. The product worked as promised, and the ice cream was delicious. My grandchildren are 6, 4 and 2 years old and I found they're a little too young for this. With the ingredients in it, the ball is kind of heavy. To mix the ingredients, you must roll the ball back and forth, and to make the ice cream in 20 minutes, you need to roll the ball pretty fast. At their ages, the kids didn't have the attention span or the strength to do this. I really like this ice cream maker a lot, but would recommend it for adults or children 7 years and older."
2,Good idea,"This product was a good idea however; 30 minutes of manual ice cream making is more than our kids (4 of them) can handle. Be careful for jammed fingers due to the texture of the outer shell. When washing use caution as water will splatter everywhere due to the honey comb type shell. Also, this will not fit into the dishwasher."
5,lots of fun,I took this to a family reunion and let the kids roll it around the room. We ate ice cream for days! The older kids enjoyed it. The little ones (ages 3-5) got a little bored because it takes longer than they are willing to deal with. The ice cream tasted great and everyone had a good time with it.
3,Novel idea,"This item looks like a good idea. It is fun for the kids, but makes a very small amount of ice cream....not worth all the work and wait."
3,OK,"I know most of the other reviewers really like this item, but I am a little disappoited in it. I've only used it once so far and it didn't work well. I followed the directions, but it took forever for the ice cream to set--50 minutes! Plus the ""ice cream"" it made was more like vanilla flavored shaved ice (I used half & half). It tasted ok, but I'll try again with cream to see if it works better. It actual instructions are clear and it is very easy to clean."
1,Plastic Junk from China,"Don't waste your money on this piece if plastic junk from China! This thing lures you in with it's pretty colors and then disappoints with it's difficulty of use. It holds only two cups, which isn't worth all the effort to make really bad ice cream. Yes, it's only 20 bucks, but it will end up on your yard sale this summer for sure. If you want an ice cream maker, don't be lured in by the pretty colors of this ""Made in China"" junk ... go get the real thing and make some descent ice cream."
3,A Little Weird,"Ok, so obviously there's a huge mix of opinion on this one and I may well be wrong: maybe it's the greatest thing ever. But for me, it sure took a lot of effort. Then again, I don't really like making ice cream or folksy things like that. A good idea, but maybe not quite worth the effort."
4,Play and Freeze,The first time we tried this it took a long time and the ice cream was very soft. The second time I didn't use the full amount of the cream mixture(about 1/4 cup less)and I chilled the cream mixture in the freezer for about 30 minutes before putting it into the Play and Freeze. I also used more rock salt than the instructions called for the second time. I had excellent results the second time around.
4,Taste amazing if you can last 20 min,"Wonderful for children around ten. Takes alot of energy to make the ice cream, but once its made, boy does it taste good!!! Such amazing flavor, you wonder why you buy store ice cream."
5,Good Product,This is a fun and easy product. It is very simple to make the ice cream mix. I have the larger version and it took about 45 min for the ice cream to freeze. I would also suggest scraping the sides down every 15 min.
5,It does work,"I got this ice cream ball as a gift. It has been a great success. Fun to use, really works."
4,Great Gift!,"Both my neice and nephew asked for ice cream makers. Rather than purchasing a small plastic toy one I thought this was great idea. Their family tailgates and camps a lot, so it was a great choice!"
2,Not a very fun investment,the item is not that easy to manipulate..you really need lots of ice n salt for this coz the melting is fast but the freezing process is slow..
4,It's just what you think.,"I wanted a ball we could roll around outside until we got ice cream. It's exactly that. It has a few idiosyncrasies like the ridges that keep it comfortable to touch also collect the milk that didn't quite get in the cylinder and the mud from the ground, but with a lot of effort you can get it out. Also they needed to provide you with a scraper. But I can handle all that. The interior is very well designed. All in all it's exactly what I wanted, and expected. I'm content."
4,works but can take a while,"Yes, it does really work, but it took about 40 minutes to make ice cream(quart). The ice cream was delicious. Then we tried frozen yogurt and that took about an hour to freeze. We had to reseal the lid b/c it wasn't on just right and it was very difficult to get the frozen yogurt off the metal sides. You do better to buy frozen yogurt. I think it's ideal for camping when your options are limited on things to do, though we passed it while watching tv."
3,Fun - but!!!!,Great Concept - and the results were yummy - however not so successful in Florida in August - just too hot for the freezing process to take hold. Will try again when the weather is more user friendly.You really need an energetic group to keep it fun - gets a little tedious after a while.
4,Fun,"The kids really had fun passing this around, but you really need to scrape it down every 10 minutes or so as it really sticks stubbornly to the sides."
4,Fun but still messy,If I had to do it again I would get the larger one. It was a lot of fun for the kids to play with (even if it was noisy) and faster than other ice cream makers I have used but it was quite messy. It was a little hard to get all the ice cream out too. The opening was to small for my hand and I have normal women's size hands. With it only being a pint I felt a little sad about that. It was enough for 2-3 small kids. It did clean up pretty well.
1,Great idea if it would work,"Absolute bust. I thought this to be great for a kids party, but it just did not work. The kids gave up after 5 minutes. The ball is to heavy to be kicked, and rolling otherwise was only fun for a few minutes - not enough for ice cream to form. Taken that I can make ice cream using in just 2 plastic bags - this tool is worthless. I did not even bother cleaning it, it went right into the trash"
4,Ice cream maker,"I purchased this item as a gift. As of today, I have not had specific feedback about it. Therefore, I am unable to provide additional feedback."
4,cool product,"My grandaughter had this marked in a magazine I received in the mail. I love the great colors to choose from and her favorite is, of course, pink. I received it quickly and have not talked to her since she has used it. So I cannot say how the Ice Cream Maker worked for her, but I'm sure she has had a ""ball"" with it. It is a very cool product."
2,LATE,"I have been waiting for this product for two weeks, they said it would come in within four or five days, which seemed fair,yet nothing has come in, I have sent numerous reports and they still haven't even written me back yet. I personally am never buying from this company for as long as I can help it."
1,Are you kidding?,What is this world coming to?What are you people buying/selling?Stop making people rich from stupid ideas.What can a ball filled with ice cream do for you?Just please stop it. Don't waste your hard earned money.
3,"Beautiful ball, hard work, little reward","I bought this ice cream maker for my mom for Mother's Day. She loves ice cream and frozen yogurt, mainly yogurt. Her favorite froyo place moved too far away from her and I thought that maybe she'd like to make her own at home. She loves the concept. But the work doesn't seem worth the reward. I could see where it would be useful if we were out camping or somewhere without electricity, though the ice supply most likely wouldn't be plentiful enough. It may be worthwhile if there were more than two people ""tossing"" the ball around--incidentally, comically pretending they're filming an exercise video--to make a paltry amount of the icy treat."
1,OMG WHERE DO I START!,Ok I think who ever invented this was trying to do good. But they have major flaws in the development of this ball.CONS: Sorry there are more cons then pros.Does not make ice cream in 15 minutes as instructions say. Try 48 minutes for ice milk.Hurts when you roll it back and forth. This has sharp plastic edges that souround ball and hurts your hands.LEAKS. Yes this leaks. We tightened this up as much as we could and it leaked.Regular ice cubes will not work. You need more of a crushed ice.After 48 minutes you get board and well give up.After your hands are red and sore you give up.The to find out that you only get less then 2 cups of ice milk there was a waist of 48 minutes. $2.05 for half and half. $.30 cents for sugar. $.o5 cents for vanilla. $35.00 for the ball itself. pain. and because of the leaks IT IS NOT WORTH IT I could have went to Kings Soopers for $1.88 and picked up a half galon carton for less pain and money.DO NOT BUY!!!!!Ok pros. Its a pretty colored ball.
1,"A gimmick, a fad","Don't waste your money and cupboard space with something that seems to have been invented just for TV infomercials.For $10 more you get a real ice cream maker and for $25 less, you can make the same kind of ice cream in a plastic bag."
2,"Great idea, doesn't quite work","I got this for the kids for Christmas a couple of years ago. We followed the instructions exactly, had lots of fun rolling it around, and wound up with some soupy ice milk. This is one of those products that is a great idea but ultimately, you don't use it much - we used it exactly one time, and no one has ever suggested using it again. If you want some exercise along with your ice cream, go run after your neighborhood ice cream truck."
4,works good,As an ince cream maker the ball is more work but it works ok. We did a demo with a group of elementary age children and preschoolers and most of them found it fun to useand the ice cream straight out of it good to eat. It does take time and works best if you stop after about ten minutes to give it a good scraping down and add more ice and salt. On a cool windy day it took about 30 minutes with two stops for scrapping.
4,"Lots of fun, but some work too",This ball was a lot of fun but it was very heavy and required quite a bit of muscle to roll it around. We sat in a circle in chairs and rolled it with our feet. You can not throw it or toss it. It is just too heavy. The ice cream was great though. We made plain vanilla. Very rich and very sweet if you follow the included recipe.
2,A real pain to make,"My mother-in-law wanted this to give to some grand nieces. We had a big group at Easter and made a batch of ice cream. The kids were definitely not going to toss this ball around long enough to make the ice cream. Don't use this inside. There was water all over - condensation. We also had a minor leak. I figure this will be used a total of one time. That makes for some expensive ice cream. The finished product was good, but not all that thick."
4,Loved them,Our grandchildren loved them. We bought one for each family. One family followed the recipe and make great ice cream. The other family used yogurt and they said it turned out great too!
4,Ice Cream Player,We purchased this as a gift for someone who has lots of grandchildren visiting her. We hope it till entertain and refresh them as often as they use it. She'll let us know how it appeals to them. We were intrigued with the idea when we saw a cooking show that highlighted the item.
3,Might be fun - outdoors - for kids!,"I purchased this as a gift for my adult son and his girlfriend and we tried it last week. The vanilla soft-serve ice cream was good (melted fast) but rolling it around on the kitchen table for 10-15 minutes seemed like forever and for the amount of ice cream it made it didn't seem worth the time. I realize, however, this is meant more as a ""toy"" for young children and I can see it be fun for them - especially in a camping situation on a picnic table, etc. Would certainly keep them entertained. (I will, however, try frozen Margaritas in it next summer!)"
2,dissappointed.,my daughter wanted this so bad!!! she was so excited when she opened this on Xmas. we followed directions to a T. it leaked from both ends so I had saltwater and ice cream getting on the carpet as we rolled it back and forth. had to keep stopping to wipe up the leak. maybe I got a 'bad one' ??if it wouldn't've leaked I'd have given it 5stars :(
2,horrible,"I really don't know what the designers were thinking when they made this, or what I was thinking when I bought it. A nice novelty, I guess, but makes horrible ice cream. The opening is so small that you can't actually mix any of the ingredients, making the whole thing an exercise in futility. Buyer Beware, I guess."
3,Could Be Better,"Needs an agitator in the freezing container to keep product from sticking to sides. Opening and scraping half way through is really messy! A ""Nerf-like"" foam sleeve to cover the outside would make the freezing process more enjoyable and easy to clean.That being said, this product does what it claims to do."
4,Love this thing!,Santa brought this for Christmas! It was so much fun and the ice cream was delicious. I didn't give it 5 stars because it took a little longer than the recommended time to freeze and the center didn't actually get solid. We drank it like milkshakes and the ice cream that lined the sides was very firm and (did I mention?) really yummy. Worth every penny! Our family of five was able to almost eat all of the contents of the quart size.
2,Not great.,"The novelty of this product is just about its only attribute. It is fun for about 5 minutes. The ball leaked from the get go so we could not roll it on the floor. It is extremely heavy, and shaking it for 15 minutes, followed by another 10-15 is a very long time, especially for kids! You need A LOT of ice and have to keep refilling the ice portion. The ice cream never got really firm, it is more like a milk shake. Tasted great, though. Plus it is very difficult to clean the outside due to its design. I would pass on this product."
4,nice icecream maker,"This is a nice little icecream maker. Simple, efficient. Just one thing. The recipe that comes with this is lame. It's worth it to look into a better recipe. At the very least use real cream."
3,Played and froze my fingers off,"The Play and Freeze quart size is way too heavy to toss around in the yard. The adults ended up rolling it across the floor or with their feet. The ice cream was actually pretty good. We could make healthier flavors and use better ingredients. The quart sized version does take a bit of time. The few times that we have used it, the process took about an hour and a half. Do not use fat free/ low fat creamer or half and half. It will take you twice as long and will never completely firm up. Also the unit does occasionally leak and needs to be drained several times during the process.Play and Freeze is a good product if you're looking for an activity to make you burn the calories that you will eventually consume. While it was not particularly fast, once we got the hang of it making the ice cream was actually fun; even if it is just a ""why did we do this again"" inside joke."
3,"Okay, but there is better","This book provides a decent framework to approach the subject of couple's therapy. However, I find that Imago therapy is definitely a superior choice. Check out Imago before you buy this book."
4,Excellent CD,"I will concur with other people who are not hip-hop fans but love this one. There is something special about it. The lyrics are very strong and sometimes in your face but make you think through out. I also would not even consider myself remotely a hip-hop fan but find this recording addictive.I think what makes this recording special is that very rarely does the energy of the performer get truely captured in the studio. In this case, I think his request has been answered when in the opening song he says ""Father most high, won't you show yourself, and shine on this record like nobody else"". ;o)"
3,"Not so bad, but not so good either (3.5 stars)","If you like the rap stuff on dc talk (...) then I can almost guarantee you'll like this. As has been said before the rapcore on here has a definite limp bizkit feel(maybe too much of one). I thought extreme days sounded like a bit of a knockoff. His non rapcore songs- ""Irene"" or ""in the Air"" for example showed his songwriting talent and diversity. I liked the album but would've liked it more if it didn't sound like he was trying to sound like someone else. (Not that they all do- there are still a lot of good songs on here) Also there were too many little tracks. They should've been intros or something-like somebody else said. A worthwile buy for all you christian music fans but if you can get the genuine article i suggest you do.This is definitely recommended for dc talk and tobymac fans but if not I wouldn't suggest spending 15 bucks on it."
3,3.5 Stars,"I'll be honest, this album has some hits such as: ""J Train"", ""Wonderin' Why"". But what made me give it only 3.5 stars is that out of its 18 songs three of them have that stupid computer voice which really drives me crazy. Also Toby put too many of those short little in between songs on the CD. He should have cut the album down to 13 songs.Other than that, the songs for the most part have good beats and he also does a fairly good job rapping."
3,So frustrating at times,"This album was good and pretty much every song started off well and had all the potential in the world to be a great song. However, Toby has the annoying habit of starting a song of great, then putting in a not so great second verse, then repeating the chorus over and over until you're sick of it. If he had cut most of his songs two minutes shorter this would be a five star album. It seems to me like they had this bad habit of carrying out songs too long all the way back from dcTalk.While this album is really frustrating at times because of the drawn out songs, I suggest getting it if it's on sale. Don't spend any more than like 14 dollars on it. Hopefully his next album will be a little better."
5,Toby takes center stage.,"After listening to the ""Solo"" CD, I knew right away that Toby Mac's album would be the best of the three, and I was right. Tait's album is great, and K-Max's is alright. K-Max disappointed me with his album, but I guess I'm just not a fan of his ""style."" Back to Toby, from beginning to end, the album is incredible. Granted, he does sample a lot throughout, but sampling does not mean a lack of creativity. I read the article from the customer from Okalahoma City, and they criticized Toby for the sampling. I'd like to see you try to write an entire album in rap/hip-hop style without sampling. ""Yours"" is my favorite. The guitar sound just hits you from the beginning, and does not let you down. ""Wonderin' Why"" will definitely have your heads bobbing, even if you don't like the hip-hop sound. Overall, I give it 5 stars, because he just blew Tait and Kevin away. To those who haven't gotten it yet, what are you thinking?"
4,It Rocks,"O.K., so its not my kind of music but my twelve year old son loves this cd. Toby Mac really rocks on this cd. My son plays it over and over. My favourite parts of the cd are the special effects, such as the synthesized voice, and the recording of his son. My son likes heavy metal, and hard rock, and rap. I would much prefer that my son listens to this cd at top volume, than many artist heard on mainstream radio."
1,not that great....at all...don't recommend this cd,"On a scale of 1 to 5 I rate the music a 1 and the lyrics a 2. I agree on many points with the reviewer A.W. Howell(read the review). The only songs that I liked was 'Irene'(liked the content and that guitar...),'Do you know'was alright and I liked the message contained in 'In the air'but besides that it is not worth listening to. From a Christian girl that is into latin music,r&b,some rock and quality Christian music this rock-rap genre just didn't do it for me. Oh, and what's up with some of these other tracks like 'Toby's Mac', 'Tru-Dog', and 'Triple Skinny'??? I expected so much more, especially more profound lyrics that grab your attention and get you really thinking about Jesus and living a meaningful Chrisitan life. *Helpful advice before buying a cd whether on-line or not:Listen to samples of each song on the cd if possible and look up the lyrics."
4,"Forgive me, Toby, it's great too...","This was the last DC Talk Solo disc I bought, and I bought it just because of a special offer. I had heard only the hard stuff and Somebody's Watching and I had the wrong impression about this. I'm really happy to have changed my mind. All the hip-hop tunes are amazing, very powerful and fun, full of message. O.K. is kind of a cross of POD (I'm not a big fan of this music that's why four stars) and Will Smith (like it), but just speaking of genres no lack of artistry or creativity here. Toby has great talent, as Tait and Max have. I wrote in another review that if they make a new DC Talk album I wanted mostly a-la-Kevin music, some Tait and little Toby, but forgive me, Toby, now I want equal parts of the three Talkers. Max is original, Tait rocks and you are so full of energy. Or break up if you all want but continue all making great records for us...Three great artists for one group is a good deal. HAHAHA."
5,Unbelievable,"I have never been this blown away with an album before. There are many albums that are good, but don't knock you over with anything unique. This is the kind of thing more artist should be trying. Yes, the computer voice annoys me a little, but I absolutely love the hardcore, limp-bizkit-like sound you get in ""What's Goin Down"" and ""Yours"". ""Irene"" really switches it up, but it is very catchy. ""Yours"" along with ""Extreme Days"" are my favorites. The song ""J-Train"" that he does with Kirk Franklin is another good one. You will not fall asleep while listening to this. This is jumpin, partying, go-crazy music. I hope others realize the new trend here and take up on it. Absolutely incredible!"
4,"Five for Toby, Four for the CD","Toby Mac is definitly the best CCM artist out there. Anyone who has seen him in concert (I've been lucky enough to see him three times) knows that he is an amazing performer. His stage presence, improv, professions of faith, and connection with the audience are insane! Extreme Days has always been a favorite song of mine, but it wasn't until I saw him perform this year at Alive Festival that I started appreciating his other song. My only problem is that Toby's infectious energy isn't captured on the CD like it is live. His concerts will blow you away... and although he CD still rocks, it just isn't quite the same. Anyways... it's still my favorite CCM CD, and I suggest it to everyone. Some other great suggestions: Audio Adrenaline (especially Hit Parade), Switchfoot (The Beautiful Letdown), Kirk Franklin, and The David Crowder Band."
3,"Some good songs here, but sound quality is not great","I don't know if it's a bad press, but the sound quality is not as good as I had hoped for. Still some good music on this collection. The title song is the hitmaker here, but ""Cry Me A River,"" Bread's ""Baby I'm a Want You"", and ""Yesterday"" are standouts as well. This is mostly covers, but well done ones."
2,"not great tea, not great price","Lipton green tea is much less flavorful (to me) than the green teas sold in Japanese markets. If you're looking for cheap green tea, try your local stores first. My local supermarket sells 40-count green tea boxes for the same price per box that Amazon charges for 20-count boxes."
1,Not good....,"I've been buying Oolong tea for a while now, and I have to say that this tea is the worst I've had. It barely has a flavor no matter how long you let it steep. I usually never take the tea bag out, and this one I left in for about 10 minutes and had to microwave the water to heat it back up afterwards. Still, not much flavor. I tried several bags thinking that maybe I just had a bad one, but that wasn't the case. I bought two boxes and ended up throwing them both away. Sender was good at sending, but maybe the tea is old on stale, not sure, but the flavor just isn't there."
2,Chinese oolong Tea Bags,"I ordered these as part of a collection of Asian themed items for a wedding favor collection...and was disappointed that the individual packaging for each bag did not look as nice upon arrival as it does in the attached photo. I have not used any of the tea yet, so can't comment yet upon its taste."
2,Stamina 15-4755,"I purchased the model 15-4755 which I believe is a little newer model than the 15-4600. While the bike is fairly easy to assamble it feels cheap. The seat feels confortable for about half an hour at most, I always used an extra cushion. I had been using it barely about 4 months for maybe 3 times a week, when it started to make a loud noise and then there was no resistance on the pedals. I called customer service and they inform me that the owner's manual clearly states that the warraty period is 90 days. I argued that they surely expect their products to last more than 4 months and they repeated that the warranty is 90 days. I had to take the bike apart, found out the belt was cut and twisted and had came out of the wheel. I had to order a new one for $10.00 + $2.95 S+H and then figure out how to replace it. Whith this quality and service I would not recommend this bike to anyone. Thinking about it 2 stars is too generous, but I can't change it."
4,Worked very well for me,Stamina 15-4600A Magnetic Resistance Recumbent BikeThe bike was easy to assemble and it has really worked well for me. I have a disability and it is easy to get on to and I am able to use it with out much effort. The only downfall is the meter it is very hard to read when sitting on the bike and the straps on the pedals do not stay hooked.
5,Stamina 15-4600A Magnetic Resistance Recumbent Bike,"Stamina 15-4600A Magnetic Resistance Recumbent BikeArrived on time, east to assemble (30 minutes) best buy for the buck. I use it daily 30 minutes at a crack. The seat pading is thin but considering the price it will do, push comes to shove it could be be recovered with added foam for your tush."
4,Great bike!,"I was a little scared to get this because I read that people were getting damaged parts, etc. But luckily when my bike arrived, it was in great shape. I really enjoy working out with it, especially since due to my Anterior Compartment Syndrome in my legs, I'm only allowed to cycle. I needed something that would hold up to every day use, as well as provide a good amount of comfort for my back. I HATE bikes where I have to sit upright on a seat with no back support. It's very uncomfortable and often cuts my workout in half because of it. But now I can work out as long as I want with no interruptions. The only thing I would love is a cup holder or a place for my iPod but ya know what...it's not even that important. I get a great work out and that's all that matters."
3,Could have been better,"When I took the bike out of the packaging the wheels were already cracked. I called the service center for new ones and I still haven't gotten replacements (over 3 weeks ago). I'm not sure if this bike was marketed as a ""silent bike"" but it rattles when I use it, not loud but kinda annoying. If you're not into the whole fad of preprogrammed bikes, this is pretty good. It could have been better if they didn't use cheap parts that didn't break before I got a chance to use the bike."
2,Broke too soon,Product broke on me within the first month. I really enjoyed it while it lasted. Not made for heavy duty excercise.
5,Just Buy It.,This is the first recrumbent bike I've purchased. 2 weeks and 20 miles down and I'm a very happy customer. The seat could be a little more padded. If your riding the bike with a purpose you should never notice it anyway. Great buy for the money.
1,Product damaged,"Product arrived earlier than the expected delivery date, which was great service from amazon. Unfortunately the packaging was torn, some parts were broken, some parts were missing, some parts didnot work and the complete set of nuts & bolts were missing from the box! We called amazon - but they said that Stamina was responsible for this poor quality.Amazon said it would be delivered in the apartment, but it was left at the apt complex front desk. This was when we called amazon specifically to ask if it was kerbside delivery or not. They assured us that someone would call us and arrange a delivery time, which obviously did not happen. No one called us regarding the delivery.We just returned the bike for a full refund. We were very disappointed at this service."
1,Buy it somewhere else,"Amazon delivers this item using a company called Eagle transportation. They lied about delivery arrangements, have an answering machine to handle inquiries, and do not call back. Obtaining his item was highly unpleasant and I would recommend buying it somewhere else."
4,Easy to use...,"Needed a recumbent bike for physical therapy on knees. It is comfortable,and easy to use as opposed to the upright bike. Seat is cushioned and bars on sides are very convenient. I need to go forward and backward, for different muscles, so it works just fine. enjoy"
5,One of the books to read on Lam Rim,This book is one of the books recommended by one of my teachers.Deep and profound not something to read in a week or even two weeks. Take your time and read with your heart.
2,Not Good,I didn't like this book because it is only for teachers. It gives them lesson plans and info. for reading The House of Dies Drear.
1,Blues or over produced country rock?,"Simple over produced country rock.The blues? No way not even close.A better title for this cd would be something like ""keep it mediocre"". Thumbs down - blues lovers you've been warned!!!"
4,Blue at its best,"Love the guitar and words are telling a story . If you like blues you will love Keb Mo , Great easy listening"
1,Couldn't finish it,"I read Ms Hightower's earlier books in this series a few years ago and enjoyed them moderately - not enough to collect the first editions, but enough to keep coming back. So I picked this one up after not seeing her work for a couple years with a certain anticipation. Unfortunately, it's terrible. The mystery isn't very interesting, but Lena and her relationsihp are what really get in the way. She is so incredibly narcissistic and self-involved that the book loses focus on the case and becomes a sort of adolescent exploration of Lena and her relationship.Skip this book."
4,Great,This printer is not bad. It's not brilliant though just OK. Good quality pictures printed too. The price though is a bit to much. I am getting a digital camera and our printer is not very good so I will probably get a new one. This is the one we will most likely to get.
5,great for reading at bedtime,This is a great story (#2 in the series) to read to your kids at bedtime - not too scary and has a few illustrations to keep the kids interested. We're looking forward to the next one.
5,Thank god you had it,"The stores around here quit carrying Honey Crunch Wheatgerm, so I turned to the great Amazon. Because I've got to have my Honey Crunch Wheatgerm fix in the mornings! I use it on cereal, yogart, toast with peanut butter. It adds crunch and more nutrition without altering the taste too much. What would I do without it--and so what would I do without Amazon?"
4,"Beautiful pictures, cute story.","This is a cute story about Wendell and Floyd (two characters Teague has written about before)and the reasons they are always late to school, reasons their teacher will never accept. And who could blame her really, until we see for our own eyes.The boys decide to get up extra early one morning before school and end up taking a shortcut Wendell makes up all by himself. With Floyd following, they swing from vines in a hidden jungle, meet monkeys and dodge alligators all just to get to school on time.As I read this story to my young boys, I enjoyed how they studied the detailed pictures and imagined themselves in the characters positions. That's what I like in a story-being able to picture yourself inside it!"
3,recent purchase,"I always look to buy sketchers products first as I've had very good luck and always are very comfortable. These are cute, run true to size but not as comfortable as some of my other sketchers."
1,LIVE Recordings,This is a live album and the description nor the cover indicate that it is a live recording. I was so disspointed as I was very much looking forward to these songs but in their original studio-recorded format.
2,Low Budget~disapointed in quality,LOVE the Singer~But quality of this CD was horrible~ dime store quality~Clarity of music was Horrible~ To Bad :(
2,Poor Photo Quality Prints,"As a standard printer for text and graphic illustrations, it's very capable. The ink cartridges do not last very long though, and they typically cost between $25 to $35 U.S. Dollars. Forget about cartridge refill kits, because the chip has to be reset, which for all intents and purposes impossible. Generic ink cartridges do not work dependably, and often don't work at all. Color and black and white photo prints are lousy. You can see each pass that the ink jets have made in the form of horizontal bars. And in between those passes is a blank area about 1/4 of a millimeter."
3,"So Far, So Good","I've had this printer for about a month now and I'm pleased with my purchase. The installation was very easy and it doesn't take up a great deal of space. Beware, the actual ppm print speeds are much slower than what's advertised but the print quality is extremely good considering the price. It's a great inexpensive option for someone who just needs a color printer for basic printing."
4,Excellent quality for the price,"This printer is easy to install and the print quality is excellent for the price. However, if you are very particular about the quality of your printed pages, you might want to check into a little higher priced model as I have seen better quality print than this. But I will repeat that for the price this printer can't be beat."
2,You're Getting Exactly What You Pay For,"A cheap printer that prints. No more, no less. I will admit that the print quality is actually pretty decent considering the low price. It's ok for occasional home printing. If you're going to be doing anything more than that, go for a better printer. The biggest disadvantage that I found is the cost of the ink cartidges. They are rather expensive. It's also not most sturdy machine. It broke after two years of ""OCCASIONAL"" use. Like I said, you get what you pay for."
2,Drinks ink,"This printer uses a lot of ink. You get very few pages per ink cartridge. The ink cartidges are very expensive. If you really want a cheap printer, look elsewhere."
4,Good for the price,"The installation was quite easy and well laid out in the instructions. The print speed is rather slow, but the quality (especially on the High Quality setting) is fine for most users."
3,Nice Printer - Expensive Cartridges,"I agree with most of the other reviewers regarding the Lexmark Z22 in that it's a pretty good value. I'll just add to be aware of the cost of replacement ink cartridges, which run about $30 each for original Lexmark ink. The cartridges didn't last nearly as long as I thought they would and this value ended up being a significant investment."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!,I got mine in the mail today and here are some things buyers need to know:It does not come with a black cartridge.It only ships with a color cartridge.The black cartridge and the color cartridge replacements cost almost as much as the printer.The print quality is pathetic.The cartridge that does come with the printer is the standard cartridge and you will be replacing it quickly because it wasn't designed for daily printing. Be prepared to spend a ton of money to get any use out of this printer.Lexmark should be ashamed to sell this item to an unsuspecting public. Don't fall for the flashy advertising. This printer is completely worthless. The only upside is the USB AND parallel connectors...
1,Trico 45-155 Narrow Refill - 425mm (1 Refill),Bought a pair of these for one of my cars.I was trying to cheap out by getting these refills. Big mistake.Hard to install. Too loose. Falls out from the wiper frame/holder.I ended up buying the whole wiper blade assembly from Costco.
2,LP Gajate Foot Pedal Bracket - Wobble City,"I own and have used itIt isnt very solid. It wobbles when you play it.I have an LP jam block (the red one) mounted to mine and a pearl bass drum pedal that came with my Rhythm Traveler set.I found it difficult to play / use because it wobbles.I looked CLOSELY and what is happening is that the black portion that extends upward vertically that the chrome arm is held onto by, THAT PORTION (that attaches to the flat floor part with the spikes and mount for your bass drum pedal), that vertical part screws onto the floor board portion and it wobbles, then adding to that the chrome arm that your cowbell or jam block mounts too has some wobble in it as well - AND THE COMBINATION OF THE TWO = WOBBLES NOTICEABLY and DIFFICULT TO PLAY because of itIt just isnt designed well."
4,well made product except for installation woes,This is very good for the price I paid for it.Note: it will need for you to remove a sight (front or rear) before you can install this by sliding it in.I would have preferred a two-piece product so there s no removal of sights during the installation process.
1,Not Very Stimulating,"Prof. Deak admits that there is an overabundance of Holocaust literature and then adds to the heap without saying anything particularly new or interesting. These compiled-essay publications are becoming all too common and seem to be a lazy substitute for creating new and noteworthy work. While his students will probably be obliged to read and admire this volume, there is little to commend to the general reading public. Yes, there IS a lot of Holocaust lit out there- and most of it is more readable, provocative and worthy than this."
1,COPY COPY COPY,"THIS IS A CDR AND NOT AN ORIGINAL, DONT BUY IT UNLESS YOU ARE INTO GETTING NOISY CHEAP REPRODUCTION!"
4,Chess player's refresher course for the class C and B Player,"Mr. Dunne presents a very refreshing guide for the Class C and low B (USCF 1400- 1700) rated player. With his directions and the cooporation of the reader, the average tournament player can see a marked increase in his or her playing ability. More importantly, it should help the chess player improve on aggression and attacking ability. If the chess player has been away from the game for too long, this is a grat refresher course on turning your chess talents back on and improving them! Mr Dunne has my thanks for helping my game!"
3,Semi-Microwave Safe,"You can put this in the microwave, but the metallic emblem gets very hot. It's hard to find one of these that are not stainless steel, therefore not at all microwave safe."
2,Predictable,If you dont mind watching movies where you can always predict what happens next the this is for you. Its a basic plot copy of the hundreds if not thousands that came before it. The only decent actor is the shuttle driver. But if your up late at night and you dont care if you fall asleep mid movie then this is for you.
1,Shuttle of Garbage,"This movie is like a stupid plot in a soap opera that is dragged out for 6 months to a year. Once the bad guy shows his face and the evil torture begins, the characters -- all of them, act out in prolonged stupidity just to keep this stupid movie going and going and going way longer that it should go. It's one stupid act followed by another followed by another and on and on. Any ""surprise"" revelations or twists are signaled way ahead of when they actually occur, especially at the end, and we are left waiting and waiting and waiting for the stupid characters and the stupid plot to catch up. And after all that, the ending is weak and lame."
2,Lame,"That's just it ... Lame. Take a simple story with foreseeable twists (the twists are mainly due to vagueness) and squeeze it for as much lamey juicy stuff as you can get. Mmmm, mmm, good. The best thing about it is the dismal ending. Not a typical happy days Hollywood ending. For the most part I'll never get the time back and what time was worth while could have been used elsewhere."
2,1hr 47mins I'd like back please,"Over done & overly drawn out for what it was. By the end I just kept watching because I had already suffered through most of it, but was just aching for it to be over. I guess the few end scenes were supposed to be the pay off. Pfft! Really, don't waste your time folks & don't listen to the positive reviewers either. Not terrible just not good. Mark my words, you'll want the hour & 47 mins of your life back!"
4,Well Crafted Thriller,I saw Shuttle after it was recommended by a local film critic in Boston. It really deserved a better distribution than a few token cities. It does everything a good thriller should; it has characters in peril you are invested in with strong performances that deliver the plot twists. The ending left me with a sense of dread/horror.
4,Good suspense movie,"If you enjoy suspense movies, this certainly is a good movie in that regard. You don't quite know where the movie is going, why the bad guy wants to keep the travelers on the bus. There isn't any indication he gives and you really don't know what is going on until much further into the movie. It kept me glued to the TV wanting the captives to escape (which of course we know won't happen as there wouldn't be a movie). Some good twists. I was a bit disappointed in the ending. Wanted more positive note, but satisfying nonetheless. Definitely recommended for horror/suspense crowd."
1,Oh Gawd NO!!!,"Not just terrible....But TURRIBLE!!!....This movie is so bad... Acting, script, no ideas at all here....Just don't watch it... Please do yourself a favor, if you want something different in horror then Watch Triangle"
1,Shockingly terriffying/bad ending,"This movie really crawls under my skin especially the way it ends,but yet very unrealistic. 1st I think one of those guys would have killed that driver.2nd once the shuttle bus got a flat, I think everyone would have walked.3rd close to the ending when she shot the driver that gunshot would have killed him.The ending had a very terriffying explanation for the way the movie was going.But the movie had great acting,and directing.But if like me you like the good guy to win win in the end,this movie is not for you.the bad guy wins out and mearly does his job for what he was so generously paid to do.My advice,rent it before buying it, and when you do,skip to the ending first and watch the ending,then watch the movie from the beginning,at some point youll know what im talking about..."
1,What can I say,"Wow, this is one of the dumbest movies I have seen in awhile. I am lost for words. There is no real story line, no plot no nothing. So don't waste your money on this."
3,It was better than I expected,"Ever since I became a mother it is hard to watch any young kids, teens adults in a movie get hurt. However I love a good thriller. This was not too gruesome. And it kept my interest throughout the movie. It is disturbing to think that these things actually happen to young women. But on purely a movie aspect it was a decent watch."
3,A Tragedy of the Worst Kind!,"How terrible were these people dilemma? So much pain, suffering, and sorrow. I guess one could find themselves in a similar situation. Of course, some of what I watched was over the top. An example being: After the captor is stabbed with a huge chunk of glass and shot, one would think that would be enough to allow the victim to escape. Apparently, this was not to be the case. Totally a depressing movie, which I actually watched on and off. I did watch most of the movie, and found myself at the end, fast forwarding it. I wanted the madness to be over. So much for that idea. What a sad ending as some have said."
4,Excellent film,"Amazon is getting me hooked to these films without big Hollywood names that are far better in terms of writing and plot than what the big studios churn out. This is a thriller that isn't too gruesome and there's limited sexual content, which is a rarity these days for scary movies.The main actresses are great and the storyline takes several twists and turns that make the film worth watching."
4,Shuttle,"It's after midnight when Mel and Jules, two young women, return to LA from holidays in Mexico; they jump in a shuttle to head downtown. The other passengers are a nervous accountant and two frat boys, one who's been hitting on Jules. They're soon on unfamiliar, deserted streets to avoid a traffic jam, says the driver, then things go from bad to worse. I expected this movie to be a boring slasher flick, but I was wrong. For once, a movie where I never saw what was coming next, much less how it ended. The worst thing about the movie was victims not inflicting hurt on their captors. A few things were predictable, but as a whole, this movie delivers on thrills and suspense the climax is original, brutal, gut wrenching and not at all expected. The subject of the movie, which we don't discover until the very end, is something we don't much think about. Highly recommend."
4,Very good,"I really liked this film! Original plot(shocker)! It was intense all the way through. I didn't like the ending, but oh well. Package arrived on time and in good condition."
5,"If you want something worth your money, buy this book.","This book will be your primary reference book when it comes to physical location of muscles, attachments, actions, relationships with other muscles, palpation techniques, and methodology to remember specifics about each muscle or group of muscles. This book is not another list of muscles to be learned by heart. It is an expanded reference book like no other I have seen or studied from. It covers muscles, nerves and arteries parthways, even funny mnenomics for those who must remember everything by heart no matter what are included. This book will not insult your intelligence. It will invite and encourage you to ""understand"", and that is the best and smartest way to learn."
1,I Never received this item,"I purchased this item which I desperately needed formy class work. However, I never received it. There was some kind ofmistake with the address I gave, which was very bizareto me because that's where I work for 8 years, so I knowthis address like the back of my head. I never received the bookthe seller tried to deliver it twice with no success. I had a horrible Amazon experience.The ironic thing is that my last name is Amazan."
2,A Formative Look at Hemingway,"Biographers have tough assignments when writing books about their subjects: how to fill a reasonable number of pages with the entire life of an individual? Even someone who's not famous or historically significant would likely have enough material about their life to fill a book. Michael Reynolds as a biographer gives in, and instead concentrates on only a sliver of Hemingway's life. This decision made for good reading and one should end up understanding that it was Hemingway's earlier years, as is the case for most of us, which ended up shaping his life and death. The book also provides an interesting look at prewar American society, in particular, the growing and changing middle class. This supporting content often serves as a break from the sometimes cumbersome biographical text."
1,DID NOT FIT!,"Did not fit my 2003 Saturn Ion 3. Spent an entire evening getting everything ready to install, soldiered all the wires and then the connector was wrong. Now I have to go buy a $15.00 harness that is guaranteed from Crutchfield and do it all over again."
2,Wrong Item for 2004 Saturn Ion Coupe,"Ordered product to allow for easier installation of after-market radio in 2004 Saturn Ion Coupe. Products alignment slots did not match up. Need to use a 70-2102, where alignment slot is on opposite side of plug"
1,Wrong Part,"Spent an entire afternoon, $20. and a couple gallons of fuel finding the right part in order to get my car back together."
5,Excellent design; works as expected.,"I ordered the harness to connect an aftermarket radio (Sony) that I purchased for my daughter's Saturn and was very happy with it. The harness is well-made, sturdy, with good quality crimps and a quality connector. Wires were a good length, color-coded to match the radio, and were nicely marked with the purpose of each wire (L speaker, dimmer, light, etc). I soldered the connections and covered with heat-shrink tube (really, not hard and the only way to secure the connection properly). The only improvement I could recommend would be to include sections of heat-shrink tube for those who might not have it available (though it can be found at any auto parts store or Radio Shack). Nice component."
2,Boring,"I watched the first 30 minutes, then turned it off. It was boring. I also didn't like the acting nor the actors."
4,Good movie!,Thomas Kiniade had a story to tell the world in his past and in his last few years of life.
2,Not so good,"This video has a nice storyline, but it moves slowly. I never really feel like the characters are who they are portraying. They just seem like they are acting to me. The storyline seems contrived, and I just never could really get into it. If I were renting it, I might re watch it, but buying it was really disappointing. I am stuck with it, and I probably won't watch it again."
2,Overly Evangelical,"Generic feel good holiday movie, VERY heavy into christianity-I felt like I was being hit over the head with evangelical messages every few minutes-disrupted the story line."
2,Slow,This movie is slow. It does not progress very well and has a predictable plot and ending. The acting is bad. I was hoping for better but I was disappointed.
5,rozlovesjesus,"Very good message,well acted,something that will not only entertain your family and friends, but reminds people about what is really important in life. A Good addition to your Christmas DVD's library."
5,True Christmas Spirit,This is one of the best Christmas movies I have seen in along time. I am giving it a 5 star review on my facebook page as well. There are not many movies that I have seen lately that show such a light on family values. Many of the movies I rent to watch with my grandchildren have bad language but this is one that I can watch with my whole family and recomend it to them and my friends. I is well written and acted. I throughly enjoyed it. I hope that you will take the time to grab a box of tissues and some hot cocoa and sit down for a good movie about love family and the joy of helping others.
4,Christmas Movies,"I liked this movie. I enjoy finding new Christmas Movies to watch every year. I was good, I will watch it again."
3,Christmas Lodge,I love the Hallmark Channel and Thomas Kincade. I can watch Christmas movies all year. It is a cute movie.
5,Happy surprise!,I randomly selected this movie and was wonderfully surprised! This is a wonderfully written Christian story. The sweet love story leaves you feeling refreshed. I want to stay somehwere like the Christmas Lodge.
1,Not ABC Family Movie,"I felt like the film sold itself at the beginning as an ABC Family Christmas film. However, slowly, as the movie progressed, there were more and more references to God and Heaven. Finally, it kind of exploded. One of the characters described a meal scene as having the grandfather ""at the head of the table"" with an emphasis on ""head"" and a dramatic pause, after which he said, ""and your grandmother at the other end."" I guess you decide which end is the ""head"" of the table based on where the man is sitting. What a creepy movie. It's like their trying to sneak in their message without the viewer knowing. They don't succeed. It's like being hit over the head with a baseball bat. A very Christiany baseball bat."
1,Heavy-duty Christian content warning,"The premise of the movie was not bad and the acting wasn't bad either - it could have been a cute little Christmas movie if not for the thick and gooey layer of prayer and (totally inaccurate) biblical references.And yes, I do realize that Christmas is a celebration of the birth of Christ - I just don't want to spend and hour watching actors pray and deliver ridiculous lines like ""What would Jesus do?"" and then ""don't quote scripture at me"". I assure you that ""what would Jesus do"" is not in the scriptures. Anywhere.I couldn't finish the movie. It was too awful."
2,Massive Christian Overtones,This isn't a fun loving family Christmas movie but more like a watching a movie on conversion.Poorly written and poorly acted in...the story line is sadly missing a proper plot. The movie is a snore-fest.
1,"Beautiful Scenery, Horribly written movie.","The horrible writing wasn't the only thing wrong with this movie. I've seen better acting in some high school plays. The heavy handed preaching I also found offensive, it was like they were trying to compensate for a badly written movie by bringing God into it."
3,"Predictable plot, stereotypical lines, mediocre acting","This movie bored us from the beginning...the dying grandfather, the doting granddaughter, the ho-hum romantic relationship, the potential new relationship, the sprained ankle, the run-down lodge, the easy money and willing hands to fix it up, the predictable plot and mediocre acting that reminded me of a high school play, with lines that sounded as though they had been written by either a 7th-grader or a 60-year-old playwright who never made it in Hollywood, the crises that weren't really crises, the climax that was expected...I wouldn't recommend this movie."
2,Smaltzy and predictable,"I enjoy a cheesy Christmas movie, but this one was just too much. All the answers came easily. The theology of God and Christmas was terrible and overly simple. I will give it to the lead actress, she can cry on command like a champ."
5,Another Christmas,This was a good Christmas movie that we will be watching every year around Christmas. It is great to see kindness rather than hate.
3,Good Family Entertainment,"This is a good family movie, for sure. I found the movie slow-moving and unbelievable in some areas, but I guess that is what the Christmas spirit is all about, believing in the impossible."
5,My favorite Christmas movie!,"The movie was still brand new when I got it and I seriously love this movie, it's a great movie for families!"
3,"Expected to love it, but...","It was just okay. The message was nice, the characters were okay, but the relationship between Mary and her grandfather seemed a little over the top and her family seemed a little unrealistic. Great ideals portrayed, but they just were a little too unrealistic for me. (And I acknowledge that I know this type of movie tends toward the unrealistic, but this was beyond belief for me...)"
2,"Title and topic had potential, but there was no passion.","I really wanted to like this one, but I felt a little preached to and there was no magic, no chemistry, in the relationships."
5,Great movie!,"I loved this movie! This was just a nice, feel good holiday movie. Heartwarming and nostalgic. I recommend it to all Christmas lovers!"
4,Christmas Lodge,I always love to watch DVD about Christmas story and this title is very touchyMake more story like this
3,Nice Story - Simple,"Pretty Simple Christmas story - lacked character development, but over all a holiday feel good movie with a good spiritual message."
1,WORST SURF MOVIE EVER,I have nothing more to say. I hope no one allows these filmmakers to make another film. So much potential with the setup but no follow through or thought process.
1,someones home video of their vacation,Unfortunately the Girl-surf movie I payed for was not what I got. THe Level of female surfing I know is much higher than what was shown in the 2 minutes of actual surfing. It's basically a home video of some girls on vacation.
2,Not Realistic,"Does not reflect the prices we have experienced at the several art auctions we attend. To be helpful it should show the high/low price for each artist for each year covered, not just one or two random results that are inconsistant with what we have seen. We tossed it."
5,Refreshing and relaxing.,"This cd reminds me of the best CD of 2000, Yo La Tengo's ""And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out"".This cd's easy refreshing gait is well worth keeping on ""repeat all"".This is the 1 out of 10 CDs you buy that's worth all the $$$ you waste on the other 9, even if it is just 7 tracks.I'm waiting an Orbiter full length release."
1,ignorant,"This book has no intellectual credibility. It is a typical piece of creationist/anti-science propaganda.Fallacies,sloppy thinking and a lack of anything approaching logic/rigour abound. Anyone with even the slightest background in the scientific method (or a lay person with a good general knowledge of science) will immediatelly recognise this dishonest and cynical book for what it is."
1,BORING,I almost fell a sleep watching this. DC needs to STOP with all the Batman stuff. We have seen it all before....twice. DC has such a wealth of characters and all they do is Batman or Superman. I get it's all about what sells but at the very least make it interesting. AT least the Superman movies are watchable. We all get Gotham is a hole in the ground corrupt city. Move on DC.
4,Good,"I like that the story was as much about Gordon, as it was about Batman. The animation was also cool. I like tacos."
4,Action and art.,"Great story, Warner Bros continues to put out a great product in the direct to home comic book character movies. This one is no exception. The artwork alone looks like a living comic book. The story, action and attention to the details we comic nerd enjoy is very high. Great movie, and great voice actors."
4,A Good Start,"Its a good story with good clean art. This is not ""superhero"" Batman. The story may be a bit lacking for those who want the Batcave, the Batmobile and the sort, this is not that story. This is more of the Batman who is learning the ropes."
4,Faithful adaptation,"This movie has the feel and pace of the graphic novel. I've always had a problem with Warner Brothers Batman animation feeling stiff but I was surprised at the energy and great animation of the fights. The voice acting is realistic and not over the top. If the animation was up to Disney or Bluth standards (not their cuteness but fluidity) I'd give this a 5 plus rating. But within the realm of WB Batman animation, this is one fine movie. Batman Year One also gives me hope that WB and DC will faithfully adapt more of the well-known Batman stories."
2,"Rent, Dont buy","Please keep in mind that my review comes without having read the graphic novel.I am not sure what DC is doing, but their Batman only animated movies fall short of their other releases. With all the amazing plotlines for these characters, I just feel that the wrong choices are being made.This movie felt very choppy and the plot fell short. I feel they could have extended the movie (its only 64 minutes) and expanded on the plot. This is the first DC animated release to have Catwoman, for which I was very excited, and her part in the movie felt like an after thought. She had such a small part that was not relevant to the strory at all. Even the animated short ""Catwoman"" could not make up for it (however the animation was much better). She is one of the top fan favorites, probably right below Joker, and they did not do her any justice.I did enjoy the gritty feel of the film, and that it was aimed to adults more so that kids."
2,Horrible movie not like any Batman before,This was a really bad movie unlike any other batman comic series in that it had so much violence and needless at that. for grownups only do not let anyone under 13 watch this movie.
1,Ending sucked.,"I was with the piece til the end where batman flies past the falling baby and catches it. It could have been executed better. The last couple films have been poor except for ""Emerald Knights."""
3,Was it necessary?,"Not that the movie wasn't enjoyable, but it was almost like watching a motion-comic. The dialog, and animation was basically the same as the original comic, which I'm sure many will appreciate. But I don't mind a little different interpretation in movies like these. It's fun to see someone's take on a literary masterpiece like Bat-Man Year 1. I don't think there's any real need for a movie that follows the comic in every exact detail, but if you prefer to watch a book opposed to reading it you'll enjoy this movie."
5,Batman is awesome,I seen many Batman movies and cartoons but this 1 goes into depth on how he became Batman in a cartoon sense so I would recommend anyone who's a Batman fan this.
5,Excellent,"Not really a Batman for young kids (younger than 10-11). It's a grown up show. This is only due to some of the violence that takes place.The story (as the title would suggest) is the first year Bruce Wayne decided to become a vigilante, and eventually the Batman. It also could be called ""Commissioner Gordon: Year One"" as it covers his story as well. Great story, voice acting is good, and the animation is easy to watch.I enjoyed this movie. If you rent it, and are a fan of batman, I know you will too. Absolutely is worth renting."
4,Dark and NOT Made for Kids,"To clear up common misconceptions. This, and many other animated superhero films, specifically DC Comics, are not made at all for children. Hence the PG-13 rating. That out the way, this was a dark and gritty Batman movie. Very 'real world' much like Nolan's films. In fact this had shades of Batman Begins. I can see this story's influence on that film. Much respect there for the material. The voice acting was ok. I'm not the one to whine about where's Conroy. He, like Christopher Reeve, don't own the character though they did great jobs. This movie could've been longer but that's fine. I also loved the tough Gordon character. DC has been on a role with these. Keep 'em coming. Now, besides Batman, maybe DC can get their live films up to par. Maybe Man of Steel next year will make a run. Maybe."
1,terrible voice casting,"I had high expectations for this movie after reading the novel by Frank Miller. The movie may stay true to the original story but there is no energy in the delivery of Gordon and Bruce. It's almost as if they just read the script once, without any thought or care. I thought it would be a lot more intriguing, much like the book."
2,Needs Work to be kind.,"I am a fan of all the DC Animated Movies, I own them all. this was the first and only big disappointment. the art was good. I do want to slam the animation style. The story was plane and uninteresting. This was one origin story better left untold. The charters do not come together that would answer any questions in any story line. if the title was going to start a new series it could work. As a stand alone it was waste. I think I hate it more because the material was not good enough for a stand alone story and there is no continuation. It could have set up a good 13 episode series, as a standalone, it needs work. If you are collecting all the DC animated movies. I will say buy this. Other wise. This was not one of their better titles. Witch is a shame, Batman: Under a Red Hood, is one of the best DC Animated movies. Batman: Year one needs work or longer story arch."
3,Good movie,"Good movie, I enjoyed the books. It worth watching, it catches you up on Batman's history rather quickly. Also includes a nice mini-movie with Catwoman.I would rent it, but not buy it, unless you are a collector; in that case do buy it."
3,Well Done but...,"I decided to watch this video because I wanted to see a story of Batman's journey to become the hero gotham needed. While it does a good job in certain aspects, others took a severe fall.The animation is awesome and done very well.I like the adult style of the film but i feel that at some points the film seeks to entertain and relys on us as viewers allowing our imagination to keep pace with the movie, regardless of logic. Not to be overly critical but somethings just make no sense. For example Bruce Wayne kicks through a tree that is clearly a couple of feet in diameter. I mean, cmon guys: you couldn't tone it a down a little? And the ending asks that you ignore all physics concerning whiplash, especially to a newborn.I liked the film, I just think that for what promise it had, it focused more on Lt Gordon's evolution rather than Bruce Wayne's. Good film but I think it barely glimpsed the surface of Batman's evoloution and growth."
2,Just...just read the comic.,"This film is a far-too-faithful adaptation of the classic Frank Miller four-part comic. Not so much a translation between mediums as a drag-and-drop into animated form that leaves the work flat and lifeless. This is barely half a step above motion comics.Comics are a completely different beast from movies. Just because your film has the same images (though less stylized in the animation) and dialogue (which gets really bad in the first half with all the inner monologues), doesn't mean it's going to have the same feel as the still images did. If you want great Batman animated films, try Gotham Knight or Under the Red Hood. Those make excellent use of the medium.On the technical size, on bluray the audio and video are, of course, top-notch. There are plenty of extras, including commentary, conversation with DC employees about Batman, and a Catwoman short that does a far better job of being animated than the feature film."
1,"""Messianic Jewish""= Christian!","There is nothing Jewish about this book- it is but another attempt by ""Messianic Jews"" to misrepresent themselves as jews and try to insert Christianity into Judaism!"
1,Good for Trash,"I am a non-jew learning about judaism and planning to convert soon(BH). This book is nothing jewish. If I wanted xtian books, I would know where to get them because I was xtian before. To have a xtian book in the Jewish section is misleading."
1,DON'T READ THIS BOOK. I RECOMMEND ANOTHER - LISTED BELOW,"This is a Christian book meant to convert Jews. Don't bother reading such trash. However, you should definitely read ""Twenty-Six Reasons Why Jews Don't Believe in Jesus"" by Asher Norman. Mr. Norman shows how ""messianic Jews"" are terribly misguided, and do not understand their own faith. As is the case with standard Christianity, it is based on misunderstandings, misinformation, and mistranslations. If they read Mr. Norman's book, they would probably all realize the error of their ways, and convert to Judaism."
1,Christian Literature,"This is not a traditional Jewish Haggadah, so Jews and Christians alike should be warned!! How would Christians appreciate buying a book about Easter, only to discover that the author's main intent was to describe in great detail how the resurrection stories in the chapters Matthew, Mark, Luke and John of the New Testament actually disagree about the factual events? Passover is the most sacred of Jewish holidays, and a time when most families attempt to get together for a traditional, religious Passover. It is very deceptive for this ""Passover"" Family Pack to not reveal that it is NOT JEWISH, but rather, a Christian take on a very sacred Jewish tradition."
1,This is Garbage,"Haggadah, meaning ""telling,"" is a fulfillment of the scriptural commandment to each Jew to ""tell your son"" about the Jewish liberation from slavery in Egypt, as described in the book of Exodus. It has NOTHING to do with the Christian faith. Introducing Christ in to the Haggadah is a deliberate attempt to destroy one of the most beautiful traditions of the Jewish faith. I guess that for these people 6 000 000 Jews was not enough. SHAME!"
1,"Beware - Published by a proselytizing ""Messianic"" sect","This is not an ordinary Passover book. It's not Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, Reconstructionist, Aquarian, or any other known stream of Judaism. If you buy it, you'll be horrified to learn that it's actually based on evangelical Christianity, and is published by the proselytizing ""Messianic"" sect also known as ""Jews for Jesus"" and similar nonsense. The publisher is a huge disseminator of material used to dupe unknowing Jews into violating the tenets of their religion and accept Jesus as their Messiah. Don't believe me? The same publisher also puts out ""You Bring the Bagels, I'll Bring the Gospel: Sharing the Messiah with Your Jewish Neighbor"" and similar books used for proselytizing. Also, please note that ""one star"" is the minimum rating on Amazon, so don't think, 'Oh, he gave it one star, must be something worthwhile.'"
1,Trash.,"If you like this drivel, you might want to try the following titles:""A Haimishe Chrostmas"" in which Santa is served warm cholent when he comes down your pripitchik, or perhaps ""The Great Mazoh Ball Hunt"" where colored matzoh balls are hidden in celebration of a holiday where we eat chocolate, wear hats, and do all kinds of other stuff that have nothing to do with anything. In summary, you stick to your religion, we'll stick to ours."
1,Warning! This is a Christian set is designed to convert Jews!!,This set is designed to make unsuspecting jews buy it and then to make them believe that the Jewish G-d and the Christian god are one and the same. It is full of lies and misconceptions. Do not be fooled by this attempt to proselytize you!
5,LEXMARK IS ON THE MARK,"Being the owner of a z12, my first printer,it came withone color and one black,of course the color was the first to goI am one who enjoys making things by hand or computer so i purchased a cd on various things you can do, Like make .cd labels , I found a section with animals, gothic letters ,all kinds of great stuff.my next is to use my scanner to upload photo of my Cat to others that are interested , and maybe treat myself to an newer version,LEXMARK PRINTER,and put this in studio, thanks and enjoy your LEXMARK."
3,"Not the best quality, but still a good value","Several of the nozzles have clogged up, and the nozzle-cleaning process produces limited success. But unless you want to print photographic quality stuff, it's still adequate for most purposes."
4,Fantastic drama heard here,"This is a wonderful recording of arias with an excellent set of performers. The drama and emotion felt in this CD is extremely moving. Horne does a fantastic job of playing her alto roles, and Pavarotti is in his usual good singing voice. My problem here lies with Dame Joan. As I am an almost diehard fan of her work, I found it dissapointing listening to her in this recording. It is obvious that she was past her prime at this point and we no longer hear her infamous coloratura singing. The acrobatics are no longer there, and the high notes are forced and not that high at all. However, this recording is very good, if only for its star power and fantastic theatrics."
4,all past their primes but still a thrill,"All of the singers are past their prime here. Dame Joan must have lost at least half her formidable voice. And her coloratura has slowed down to a slow stroll. You have to hear her when she was the greatest singer the world had ever seen.Pavarotti and Horne are slightly better. But they are also disappointing to my discriminating ears. But if you never heard them when they were supreme, you may still be extremely impressed. They are that good that even when they're past their prime, they still have valid voices.If you never heard Dame Joan when she ruled the operatic world, don't buy this, she will be discredited.However, even if Dame Joan is way past her prime here, if you know how she sounded when she was the Queen of opera, it's still a must buy. Because even though her voice is half gone, she's still Prima Donna Assoluta. But only buy this if you know how she's supposed to sound."
5,good music,i listen to this cd just about every day good to relax with this cd.the 3 voices seem made to go together
5,Hello! Anybody in there????,"Hey, publishers, this is too much excellent performance not to be available on video. Any genuine opera lover will buy the video tape/DVD of this live recording."
1,Battery was dead,"Received battery and it was dead. I charged it.Still dead. I cleaned the contacts, which seemed dirty...still dead."
5,bing crosby christmas television specials vol.2,IF YOU LIKE SHOWS FROM THE 50'S AND 60'S YOU WILL LIKE THIS DVD THE CHRISTMAS PARTS WERE GREAT.
4,"Some good, some bad","The comic segments are pretty lame by today's standards, but the singing is well worth it. Lots of nostagia - especially like the segment with Bing and David Bowie and the year that just had Bing and Frank Sinatra singing nothing but Christmas songs."
3,It's classic if Bing is in it,Disc 1 you would hardly know it was about Christmas except Bing sings at the end of each show. Disc 2 is what we have come to expect of Bing's Christmas shows.
2,"Way too much uninteresting, boring footage!!!",Are you kidding? Bing Crosby must have done better stuff than this!!!! The first DVD was incredibly boring...took place in England...black & white...2nd DVD finally had some rather entertaining Christmas footage in color...but slow moving & not up to the par that I remember from the old days!!! I'm a senior citizen...loves the old performers & movies...but this definitely was not worth my money!!! The cover of this DVD promises more than it delivers!!!
2,Dated and Boring,"We were really looking forward to watching this Christmas eve but what a bore. We did not finish watching either disc. The first black and white disc had no stage presence just Bing standing there singing and he was no spring chicken at the time. Then he had his London apppearance and that wasn't any better. He traveled around London with skits that were frankly stupid. Then we tried to watch the second disc in color with Mary Martin and that was a little better. You would not know that this was a Christmas special until about 45 min. into the disc when there was finally a Christmas song. No pretty stage sets, nothing! What a waste of money."
5,Memories!!,What can you say about Bing Crosby that hasn't been said. Bing was one of the classic entertainers that I grew up with. along with Bob Hope and Dean Martin. Our family always looked forward to Bing's Christmas Specials and these DVD's do not disappoint.
2,not quite what I expected,"first dvd had shows which were not what I consider Christmas shows. . .second DVD was better, but still not as good as I was expecting"
4,Good text but distracting model,"I own many pilates and yoga books and think that this offers a good resource for a person that wants to see positions detailed for a home practice combining the two disciplines. The only objection that I have is the choice of model demonstrating poses for the book. One in particular is an older woman with a long, gray, messy ponytail and awful looking feet. Not exactly an inspiration. It isn't necessary to put a covergirl on the pages of the book, but her disheveled images are a distraction from the intended purpose."
4,Some inredible songs...,"The following songs alone are worth the price of the disc:(If You Think You're) GroovyThe First Cut Is The DeepestEverything Is Gonna Be AlrightThe Time Has ComeHearing her cover Billy Nicholls (written by John Paul) ""Would You Believe,"" Brian Wilson's ""God Only Knows"" and ""Angel of the Morning"" are just a bonus. I would have paid good money, though, just for the four songs mentioned above. Buy this, and then buy whatever you can find by Dee Dee Warwick."
5,A Great and Idiosyncratic Poet,"Amy Clampitt was an American original. Both her life and her poetry demand serious attention. Having all of her five volumes in one big, beautiful book means that a reader can take the measure of (and derive pleasure from) the woman who was America's oldest ""young"" poet, who did not publish her first book until she was 63. Now that her letters have also been published, we can get a sense of the woman behind the pen. Both the letters and, even more fully, the poems, attest to the deep humanity of a wonderful writer."
1,"It is okay, but not world's best.",I tried this brittle and it was okay and then I ordered some from MMS Brittles where they have Auntie Muriel's Premium Peanut Brittle. Now that stuff could be considered the world's best. It was a softer brittle and the taste was WOW! The day it came my family was over visiting and when they left my order was finished.Luckily my mom and dad loved it so much that they ordered some for themselves and bought me some more as a gift. Now I know why I love them so much.
2,Not the classic it's presented as...,"This book caused a major stir when first released in the 60s. But labor history studies have changed a great deal since that time. The entire orientation of this book is patronizing to the amazing works of the IWW.For example:1) It completely ignores the IWW's international aspects, for example that the IWW had more influence in Chile and Australia than in the US and Canada.2) It glosses over the IWWs activities during the 1920s, the Marine Transport Workers' control of the Wetsern Hemisphere's shipping, longshore workers in North America, the 1927 Colorado Miners' Strike, etc. etc.3) It has no coherent understanding of why the IWW declined. How FDR worked with Lewis and the CIO to force unionization, the principled stands the IWW took to stop the rise of business unionism, and some buttheadedess by the IWW's membership.It contains many good stories and is an OK overview. The definitive work is still waiting on the subject."
1,the price is too high,I have watched these books go up since a year or so ago.I debated at $150 for this book last year. Looking back i guess I should have invested and tried to gouge someone else like the seller here is ($450)I am currently seeking this book as a reference for my restoration. If I get one I will sell it (with no gouging) to another person who is ready to put the book to use!Thanks for reading my rant
1,The cover lies!,"The cover of this book promises four free online practice tests, but then they only let you do one. You have to pay for any more than that. Also, the vocab list is short and too easy, and there aren't nearly enough practice questions (especially considering that you only get one practice test!). This book has a few good tips, but you can get those from another study guide that also provides practice tests.In short, this book will NOT prepare you for the GRE. Spend your money elsewhere!"
4,"Pleasantly surprised, but...","I'm not particularly a fan of Justin Timberlake, but I watched this concert on HBO out of curiosity, and I was very pleasantly surprised. This guy puts on a good show, even if he does owe a royalty check to Michael Jackson, among others. The voice holds up well live, the band was solid, and the choreography was well done; it came together for a very tight, well-produced show. However, that's also part of what I don't like about it: it's so tightly produced and choreographed that there's no sense of spontaneity. Except for the specific references to New York and Madison Square Garden, you get the feeling that it is note-for-note, step-for-step the exact same show that concert-goers saw in Los Angeles, Phoenix and every other stop on the tour. That's about my only qualm with it though... for anyone who enjoys dance/pop music at all, this is worth checking out."
3,Decent but NOT extraordinary. 3.5 stars.,"Justin can write, sing his butt off and is a looker. However, this performance was mostly good but a mixed bag.Senorita and Cry Me A River were good save for the crazy electric guitar arrangement. Why that was included I don't know.Now Justin is s true performer (dancing, singing and playing the piano) who shows talent. However, he's no Britney Spears or J.Lo when it comes to dancing.The outro, Another Song (All Over Again) is spectacularly done production wise, vocal-wise and especially the lyrical content!Cover Art: BSongwriting: B-Vocals: B-Production: B+Length: A-Overall: C+3.5 stars."
3,I BOUGHT IT TO MY WIFE...,Concert: 2 stars ( I dont like JT... so take this review with caution)Picture quality: 4.5 starsAudio quality: 4.5 starsExtras: 4 stars
1,Absolutely Uninspired,"This has to be one of the most boring live acts I have ever had the displeasure of watching. He tries too hard to be edgy, and cool; the whole tough-guy image just doesn't suit him. Also, he should lay-off those wannabe Michael Jackson moves, and focus on his vocal performance. Overall the concert falls short of ingenuity, and entertainment; therefore unless you are a die-hard Justin fanatic, stay clear of this production."
5,Excelente Producto,"Excelente producto, filmado en uno de los mejores auditorios del mundo, el Madison Square Garden de NY. 100% recomendado tanto el vendedor como el producto."
5,way better than live from london,first of all i'm very impressed with how fast my dvd was shipped. it was in perfect shape with all original art work. i bought justin's dvd from the justified tour and this one was so much better. tons of songs and a terrific show. watch it on a big screen with surround sound and its almost as good as being in the garden with him. the bonus dvd was a great add. this concert is well worth the money i spent on it. a must have for any true justin timberlake fan. love it!!
2,JT,"I LOVE Justin Timberlake and I LOVE this concert - I've watched the HBO special on tv many times. You can understand my disappointment upon receiving the DVD of the HBO special and finding that it had been edited!!! Well...all except for ONE SONG. Perhaps the editing team took a bathroom break during Cry Me A River. Ridculous. Nowhere did it say ANYTHING about this being an edited version. had I known, I would NOT have spent the money on it. I would never in a million years expect that a DVD of an HBO show would be edited."
5,"Futurist, Sexy and Lovelly Show!!!","The best ever permance about Justim! He is amazing on stage! Dancing and singing all his sucesses and give us I Futurist, Sexy and Lovelly Show!I already bought this DVD and now I bought on Blu-ray... Big diference! Best sound... Hight-definition is a amazing expirience!That`s why Madonna is working with him!Great show!!! I Love it!!!"
5,JT -- 'nuff said!,"OK -- I wasn't a huge JT fan... until I saw him on HBO. (This is the DVD of that HBO telecast.) He is amazing. I have seen this about 25 times, and I expect to watch it another 25."
3,Excellent Robotics!,"The robots created to portray the two pygmy characters are very life like. Aside from some sparks that are visible during one particular scene late in the movie, these simulacrums are very life-like. It's almost enough to convince you that pygmies are real!"
3,"for the jazz, not the funk","more modern jazz than funky time, which was the impression I had from their concert in central park in july 05."
5,Debra Tash is clearly a gifted writer,"Set in ancient Mesopotamia, Debra Tash's historical novel, The Maiden's Song is the compelling story of one man who holds within him the potential for creating the first empire, and the haunting melody sung by the beautiful woman he saved from death. A saga of love, adventure, and the dawn of civilization, The Maiden's Song is an engaging read filled with a strong sense of place and destiny. Debra Tash is clearly a gifted writer and one to keep track of!"
4,Creative Wall Coverings,"I never thought of using glitter or giving my wall a tattoo. This book opens your mind to new ways to treat walls. Some ideas, like murals, require some artistic ability. Other ideas include applying rhinestone designs or using gilding.The book doesn't include step-by-step instructions, so you may have to experiment a bit to create the looks showcased in this book."
4,Helpful decorating ideas,I found this book to be very helpful in decorating my bathroom. I even found a wallpaper that was perfect AND the name of the company where I could purchase it!
2,This is not Pilates.,"I borrowed this from the library.The two instructors have over 50 years of experience in exercise doing Pilates, Lotte Berk, yoga, dance and tai chi, and it shows. This is FUSION, so much so that it makes me confused. I wanted a Pilates workout. The large words on the DVD cover say ""pilates plus"", but really it should be ""FUSION with a little bit of pilates"".I had to stop playing it after 20 minutes. Besides the confusion of what this workout is, the instructors voiceovers were bad and the music was irritating.Winsor Pilates DVDs are my favorite for mat pilates so far, but sometimes I want variety. I will keep looking..."
2,OK workout,"This might be a good beginner's workout. I've been doing pilates for only 3 months and get a better workout from Winsor Pilates Bun and Thigh Sculpting and Abs Sculpting. Also, a few exercises require an empty wall to lean against. If you don't have that, the modifies exercise isn't very effective."
2,Pilates?,I purchaed this for pilates and didnt find to much of that. Disappointing. I also found it very boring. The voice on the DVD bored me and made me sleepy. I dont know how pilates can be in the title and not have much of it in the video.
1,Too complicated,"I have done pilates before and was excited to buy this to do at home. Once I put it on, the instructors a male and female, seemed to work well together but even for me these moves were confusing and didnt feel like pilates at all...it may be another form of pilates, but wasnt for me. I shut it off after 15 minutes because I really tried to give it a chance....dont buy this unless you are very experienced in pilates and looking for something different"
4,pilates,This is not traditional pilates but there is a lot of core in the movement. The workout is not intense but still a good workout.
4,Quick and Effective Workout,"I have been very pleased with the Core Fusion Pilates Plus DVD. I can pick and choose which routines I want to do, giving me variety and flexibility with my time. The instructors are easy to understand and follow. The pace, intensity, and difficulty of the routines can accommodate beginning to advanced fitness levels. Compared to the Winsor Pilates 20-minute Workout I had been using, the Core Fusion Pilates Plus gives me a better workout and is a better use of time. I would recommend this DVD for those who are short on time or want to add variety to their Pilates fitness routine."
5,Wow! Amazing Workout!,"As a certified personal trainer and fitness instructor for over 12 years, these workouts are amazing! No matter how experienced or strong you think you are, these workouts will challenge you. If you have Direct TV, several of these workouts are available on Fit TV channel 261 also. Also available at Amazon Video on Demand."
4,Great Quick Workout,"It's truly amazing how in as little as 10 minutes, you will feel the effects during, and after! One would think 10 minutes isn't much, but the moves are effective, and in some cases, they were kicking my ""bottom"" within the first 2. Stick with it and you will see results!"
2,Decent but not pilates,"I was excited to give this a shot after reading all the glowing reviews on here but I was disappointed. Yes, some of the segments were challenging but the 10 minute segments seemed to drag on. Only a small section of it is similar traditional mat pilates, which is not what I was expecting (and perhaps that's why I was so displeased). I guess bottom line is I was expecting one thing based on the reviews here and I got another thing that I didn't find to be very exciting."
3,Extremely challenging Pilates,"Usually the pilates dvd's that I have purchased were too easy. NOT THIS ONE. Wow, this workout is tough."
3,HARD! HARD! HARD!,"I am very much in shape and this kicked my butt, which is great but I felt like you would need a trainer to do the moves correctly. The jury is still out on this video, may have to try it again."
3,more advance level of work,"this tape is great for someone who is very advanced, but the moves are beneficial"
2,boring.,"For someone who thinks they may have ADHD, this video may not keep your interest, unless you do it with a partner or two. I prefer workouts (like dance workouts)that stimulates your cardio system while challenging your body to different forms and movements. This one may help maintain your muscle tone but it definitely does not provide the cardio or the interest factor.Another disappointment was that after doing it twice through, my muscles didn't feel a thing. I've done other pilates and yoga workouts that really made me sore, but this one just wasn't giving me that nice feeling. Perhaps I'll give it another try later."
4,Strength in Stillness,"This video is one of the best workout videos I have ever used. First of all it keeps my attention. Secondly, it is actually possible to follow what the trainers are doing and recreate it myself. That said, I can only do the beginner positions and I'm still sore the next day. I know I will work out with this video for a long time to come as I grow in strength. It's unbelievable how simple a move will look but how it is difficult to execute. I have dropped a dress size in a month and 10% of my body weight with this video as one of my secret weapons."
4,Awesome and challenging.,"I am pretty weak as only one year ago I couldn't exercise at all and was totally exhausted. So I have just started and this dvd is awesome. its very challenging but therapeutic. So far so good I really like this dvd. On the other hand - I can't do the whole dvd at once in one day, maybe in 2 days or doing parts of it in one day.But besides that its very awesome in the genre of pilates/lotte berke/barre workouts available."
5,Very challenging and didn't get bored!,I do a lot of pilates videos and this was the first one in awhile that I was sore from! And it was 50 minutes to do all 5 sections and it flew by because each ten minture workout was so different you don't get bored =)
3,Group 1850 - 'Paradise Now' (Free),"Band's second lp - gracing our ears in 1969. Maybe not as good as their other two releases - 'Agemo's Trip To Mother Earth' ('68) and 'Polyandi' ('75) but still not a bad pick. Tunes I was somewhat impressed with were the trippy title cut ""Paradise Now"", the uplifting ""Hunger"", the cool-sounding instrumental ""Lonelyness"" and the eleven-minute epic ""Purple Sky"". Personally, I would likely not pull this CD out for a spin as often as I would their other two offerings - but - what the hey?"
4,A summary of Hungary's plunge into the war,"Dreisziger's is a rather balanced account of how Hungary ended up entering World War II on the Axis side. Relying heavily on some classic sources such as Professor Macartney's ""October Fifteenth"", regent Horthy's Memoirs or D. Jaszi's ""Revolution and counterrevolution in Hungary"", it is a readable and quite accurate narrative. My only concern is the author's clear anticommunism, unfair criticism of the revolutionary period of 1918-19 and weak defense of Horthy's non-democratic regime. All in all, an interesting book for those keen on understanding Hungary's evolution into an Axis satellite, provided the reader can sift facts from the occasional antileft slant."
4,Stick a Geranium in Your Hat and Be Happy,"Great book. With the problems in her life she still had hummor. She brought up a great many points that we all deal with and in her own humerous way told us how to handle them. Bottom line, depend on God."
1,Pseudo-Christian Claptrap,"I will never ever recommend this author. She may claim to be a Christian, but her behavior is anything but. This person has no business counseling parents of homosexuals, as it is clear she has no understanding of them. She describes them as something that formed wrong, flowers that didn't open. I have news for you, Ms. Johnson. God doesn't make mistakes. Each person is made that way for a reason, just because you can't get out of a stone age interpretation of the Bible, don't infect other parents and friends of gay people with your poisonous fake christian ""love"". I want to go wash my hands in lysol. It is because of attitudes like hers that Christians like me are portrayed as a bunch of whacko nutjobs."
1,Just Horrible,"I was unfortunate enough to receive this book as a ""gift"" from my mother (along with Where Does a Mother Go to Resign""). As a gay Christian (yes, a GAY Christian), I find Mrs. Johnson's writings decidedly disturbing and un-Christian. The Bible does NOT clearly condemn gay people (if one researches historical and language origins of Biblical writings) and to base her reaction to her gay son on Christian beliefs is just wrong. So yes, I think that makes this a bad book."
3,very helpful in difficult times,"The author has survived devastating tragedies including the deaths of two sons. She certainly doesn't 'make light' of tragedy, but seems to find a good balance between pathos and comedy. Sometimes her humor is a bit silly, but more often genuinely funny. She believes that 'laughter is good medicine' which can help heal the broken heart, and I must say I agree. After reading this book, my own heartaches had not disappeared, but I did feel that there was hope for brighter days ahead. I don't believe that 'misery loves company' but that we do find some hope and encouragement in knowing that others have experienced pain and loss and have survived. This book helped me find that hope and encouragement."
5,Encouraging!,"In yet another uplifting work by author Barbara Johnson, we are led page by page through so many of lies challenges, and through her words we are taught to look circumstances in the eye and chose to be happy.In this work, Barbara teaches us how to release the joy within us and use God's promises to fill our souls with laughter instead of sorrow and grief.Always an uplifting read can be found in all of Ms. Johnson's works and this book is no exception. Indeed life is tough, but you are tougher, if you only chose to be.Barbara shows you how and encourages you along the way.Shirley JohnsonSenior ReviewerMidWest Book Review"
1,Horrid book by a heartless woman,"I was given this book to read shortly after coming out to a relative, back in the early nineties. What a cruel joke that was. Luckily, my relative has since learned how terrible that move was. A large portion of this book is dedicated to Ms. Johnson's gay son and the ""burden"" placed upon her by his very being. She is proud to say that she has estranged herself from him. There's nothing funny, sweet, or even mildly loving about that."
4,Stick a Geranium in your Hat,"I agree that BJ spends a huge amount of time writing about her gay son and diminishing the tragedies regarding her other 2 sons and her husband's accident. Readers might benefit by skimming over those long and often repeated portions on 'gayness' and pick up instead on her light-hearted and insightful encouragement. I enjoy her humor - she's like an Erma Bombeck with the Christian piece added right up-front. For those seeking other Christian authors with a humorous slant, pick up one (or more!) of John Ortberg's books."
1,Disbelief,"Well, I am sorry to say that for me, was really frustrating to open my package and find out that the book sent to me was a miniature of it. I could not believe it. I was shocked!! When I bought it, had nothing saying that what this person was selling, was only a miniature of the real book with only the highlights of it. This is my first time in a book club and now I am reading my second book and I let somebody else buy for me. I am afraid to buy anything that has a lower price now. In mean while, all my friends keep telling me that they bought a book for a good price, but I do not have courage anymore, or for a while to try to do it again on my own. That was a real shame.I bought this book with ""Savings4U"" on Feb.09, 2011"
3,"Stick a Geranium in Your Hat and Be Happy (John, Sally) (Purchased on 12/13/2009)",I have found it very religous focused..It gives tales of Barbara Johnson lifes experience for family and herself.Some of it I found hard to follow. The style of writing sometime puts me off to continue reading further on.I did like some of little saying / phrases throughout the book..that were in BOLD.But I wouldn't be recommending this book to others to read and as it not a easy way to help others...solve and reasure them that life continues after awful events- trageties.As I'm still feeling in a downer after reading it.Life is a bastard and GOD does not exist...as one bad thing after after another shouldn't be how life should be.This book frustated me..Thank you to Amazon for their deliver through the post and followup on my purchase.
1,How dare you be a homosexual!,"I read so much about her down to earth humor and wit that I picked her up. You have to be really right wing, and realy christian to truly enjoy her book. And if you are, you will enjoy her breezy depictions of her marriage, identify with her horror at discovering her son has succumbed to the `homosexual lifestyle' (as the blurb puts it.) and egg her on all the way, upbeat despite all her travails. If you are slightly more iiberal, you will question the very basis of this book, think her humor extremely offensive (he cannot be gay, he is a christian) and believe there are many people who have lead much more difficult lives than her, who do not try and make a book out of it."
3,Forgettable,Everything is well sung here but the voice is not especially distinctive or memorable. German texts of the songs are provided but without Engish translation. There are plenty of more competitive recordings of Schubert.
1,A Piece of Junk,"We lease or own 7 computers. Because Lexmark had been a good name in the past and because they (z42 & z52) were priced right, we decided to buy 4 Lexmarks. Anyone reviewing this product at a score higher than a 1 has to work for Lexmark. I will never buy another one and will replace these as soon as the recession lifts. They drink ink to the tune of a cartridge a day. Their software is defective and their tech support worthless. I complained about the software crashing on our Prosignias at the front end of purchase and received an email from Lexmark in response describing how to replace cartridges. This is one company that needs to go the way of Enron."
2,INK GUZZLER,"I couldn't agree more with Mr. O'Connell; this machine does not live up to its billing. It is a serious ink guzzler---reminds me of my LandCruiser going through gas. The black ink cartridge lasted less than 500 pages of wordprocessing, which is extremely expensive. The black snd white printing is quite good; the color in my view is unsatisfactory. The clarity is nowhere near the sample in the store machine---grainy and unclear even from my 2.1 pixel digital camera at the highest setting. There are clearly visible lines and grain. Black and white is extremely fast; akin to a laser; the color is painfully slow; I cannot take as credible the reviews that claim that color printing takes less than 1 minnute; color averages 5 minutes and longer for photos. REcommended only for word processing; otherwise, this printer is slow, expensive and low resolution."
5,Great printer for a great price!,I've went through about 3 diferent kinds of printers before I bought the Lexamark Z52 and all of them can not produce the brilliant photo quality that this printers provides. Practically no dots can be seen! Color is vibrant and paper jams are much easier to handle. Speed is amazing! This printer is a must for all of those out there who like to print photos a lot. Don't go wasting your money on HP! Be smart and save money with this printer and buy it now!
1,Complete waste of money,"I will never buy a Lexmark again. The printer software contains spyware that runs continuously in memory, phones home with usage information and crashes computer. The print quality is poor, it has never been able to produce true black text. Cartridges constantly dry up and are expensive."
5,Great Printer,"The Lexmark Z52 printer is a true gem and should be used for anybody that prints a lot and hates to wait. Before owning this I owned a Canon printer and it took about 5 minutes a sheet to print. On this baby it takes maximum one minute. The only thing it may take a little longer on is a picture. This printer prints quality papers, will last long, and is just great for any computer user to have. So there you have it. In need of a good printer that won't leave you sitting for minutes, buy this Lexmark Z52. It will be enjoyed by all.HAPPY PRINTING!"
4,Excellent low cost rinter,Prints about 13 pages a minute for me. Color graphics and text look excellent for such a low cost printer. Printer does not take to long to calibrate. Very happy with purchase.
1,Not happy,"I upgraded from a basic HP610 so I could get great color prints from my digital camera.I wanted another HP but let the store salesman talk me into getting a Lexmark Z52. It eats ink cartridges which cannot be refilled sucessfully. Constantly gives message ""unable to communicate with the printer"" and the color pictures and also black and white are terrible. I talked with Lexmark tech service and they had me send them some pictures illustrating my complaints and after they reviewed them phoned me to say they thought THE PICTURES WERE FINE. Unbelivable. Am shopping now for either an HP or a Canon.I have been working with this printer for 18 MONTHS so this is not a casual review after just a few days."
3,average machine,"I bought this because I read that it has a feature to direct unknown caller ID's immediately to voicemail. Unfortunately, the word ""immediately"" is not true. Your phone still rings once before voicemail picks up. I REALLY want something that will cause your phone to not even ring when caller ID is unknown/anonymous. I get 10 sales calls a day. The voice quality is very average - it's understandable. Nice thing about this answering machine is that it uses flash memeory and doesn't require a battery backup."
4,One Feature Gives It The Edge,"This is a fine answering machine, the controls are a bit confusing at times (it took me three tries to get my message recorded correctly) but overall it does its job. But one feature sets it apart. You can set it so it answers those ""unknown name unknown number"" calls on the first ring. If you get a lot of telemarketer calls, this is a must-have feature. As someone else mentioned, it would be nice if the phone didn't ring at all for these calls, but it's far better than most other answering machines. Goodbye telemarketers, I don't even reach for the phone any more unless it rings twice."
2,"Neat idea, but hard to use.","I was excited by the concept of this product but was disappointed with the experience. I ran into troubles installing it, as it was forcing me to uninstall a newer version of Quicktime and use the older version on the CD. It also took longer to learn how to use and my kids 5 and 7 were frustrated with it quickly."
3,From a practitioner's point of view,"Most of the information is already available in various suppliers' catalogs and publications. Pictures of application are old and show little detail if any. Advances in facing materials and adhesives were not discussed in length so are the tooling and manufacturing equipment used in this industry. Would appreciate more information on failures and cause of failure of bonded structures.On the plus side there are lots of graphs, tables, illustrations, and examples of calculations which are useful. Reference given are good place to get further information.In general this is an expensive book in hard cover that is meant to be kept on every practitioner's reference bookshelf."
5,"Great Pics, Great Text","I admit I bought this book because I really liked the clever caricatures of Civil War figures like Lee, Grant, Jackson, etc. But the mini-biographies of each person are really fascinating too, especially chapters dealing with some of the lesser known figures like spy Rose Greenhow and Robert Anderson, the Union guy who surrendered Fort Sumter. The author dug up some little ""nuggets"" about each person that you don't usually find in the history books, and it is this kind of offbeat data that makes history come alive. By the way, the bios are one half Rebel, one half Union--equal time, I guess. I think the author has a slight pro-Confederate bias, but I didn't mind that at all."
3,"Fatty, Dry, Unstable","These are just okay. I bought them because I remember seeing them growing up, but I wasn't allowed to eat snack cakes as a child. And they made them look really good on Seinfeld. Now was my chance.They are really dry, and when you bite into them, they immediately begin falling apart. I thought the streusel was going to be moister too, but it was as dry as one would expect straight ground cinnamon with a touch of sugar would be.And for cakes so dry, who can believe they are so fattening? Not to mention the 2.5 grams of (delicious) artery-clogging trans fat. I guess they won't be spoiling any time this year. Strangest thing about them is when you eat them, it's like....you never ate them. They need more flavor.I've never been a dunker with cakes or donuts, but try it and they might be better."
2,Don't Know If They Were Too Old or Always a Little Dry.,"Bought them as a Seinfeld gag gift so it didn't really matter, but I wouldn't buy them again, even if they showed up in our local grocery store."
4,A fine piece on a one-of -a-kind director,"I've always been fascinated by Lynch, and clearly is the author of this book. Chion understands and realizes the power of film. The problems with this book (which should not prevent you from buying it) are the fact that the book is translated from French (character names are misspelled in the process) and that Chion is sometimes too tough a critic (he is hard on Wild at Heart). Overall, one of the best books on Lynch I've read."
5,Fairies Rule,"Galbreth fairies rule in any place but in my new car as floor mats, they add a whole new look. I was trying to keep my tan interior from getting tainted and when I checked into fairies I was blown away that I could actually get something more like art than kindergarten. They are great durable mats, easy to clean, beautiful colors and look great in my car. Would love to have matching back floor mats but none available that I can find. I tracked the fairies from place of departure to final arrival time. My poor team received two to three updates each day. Luv the mats!"
3,New Market Woman,Hard to find great floor mats for woman. I find them a little smaller and a little slippery on wet feet but I love the design. My old floral ones had worn well but had seen better days. There were not many floral ones that looked like anything but a Hawaii Shirt. Happy to have them. Have told my woman friends.
3,end of an era?,well i got this cd a few years ago actually. its not that impressive. the album art is what got my attention. makes you think the album is going to be a dark powerful romp. but its just like all other J church stiff. so...while not being bad..its nothing new and i am guessing its the last one from these guys...or is it?
5,Delightful,"I have such fond memories of sitting around the piano as Uncle Johnny played the boogie woogie, my cousin Richard Glen made the guitar talk, my mom Helen sang all her favorite requests and we all ate Aunt Katherine's home made fudge (which became hard while still hot and would melt in your mouth). That was an introduction to music for me which has become a love I cannot live without. Chuck Alan is a supremely talented musician and vocalist. This album is a delight to the ear."
2,Buyer beware,"I ordered this set on the soul basis that it had origanal Japanese Audio. I just got it in and looked at the back. Only 2 of the 6 movies are orignal japense Audio the rest are very crappy english Dubs. The Four movies that are English dubs come on 2 disks that are ""Welcome to the Grindhouse"". It is not a total waste since Bullet train is a 2 disk set and Golgo 13 are both not dubbed. But i got the set for the body gaurd and karate warriors. So if you are A Chiba Fan and want the orignal movies this is not the set for you"
3,Dated but still relevant,"Although this book was written over ten years ago, I found the chapter: Republicans on Mars to be an interesting look back at science fiction and the military"
3,"An interesting read, good points, Author has a strong bias.","It's a good book with a lot of background on SF and how it effected our culture. The author does seem rather put out over the fact that more conservative authors had more effect than the left-of-Ted-Kennedy authors like himself. He does attack a certain liberal group with the same fever that he saves for the SF-Military authors at Baen Books. The ""if it has a penis, it must be bad"" feminists. Taking his obvious bias and anger in stride, this is a well researched & well written book by someone inside the business."
5,Fantastic service,The seller actually contacted me to make certain that I understood the item was an album and not a CD. It then arrived promptly in the conditi0n as described.
3,Freeform  - Green Park,"Freeform's GREEN PARK kicks off with the bucolic bells, whistling and kazoo of ""Tired Of Waiting,"" an intro that's almost sleazy listening in style. Indeed, the chaos circus of ""Precision Clownage"" suggests that he's moving away from the IDM of his earlier work, even if the sharp sonic mass of ""Windup"" shows that it's not a 100% move. ""Sopping Wet"" varies between pure ambience and tropical downtempo. But in case that's too traditional, he gets back to the weird with ""Twentytwo"" and harmonic metallic clanging with ""Spinder"" and ""Tin."" Indeed, ""Wait4me!"" returns to pure, thumping IDM, despite the New Year's noisemakers to keep things casual. But ""Craving For Grey"" gets things mellow again, even as the melody drops out and only the rhythm and some funk bass remains. It's good to see Freeform branching out, even if it does muddle the album as a whole."
1,How to better fornicate and be a professional deadbeat,"First of all, if you need an instructional video to teach you how to talk to women, you are a clown and a loser. Secondly, and most importantly, this video (and most other products from Tariq Nasheed) promote the same immoral and destructive behavior that is keeping Black people in a state of chaos. How would you feel if your mother, sister, niece, or daughter was approached by some idiot who feels ""empowered"" by watching or reading one of Nasheed's products? I would feel sick to my stomach. This guy is an insult to his Muslim name. If he understood Islam, he would realize that promoting this type of promiscuity and letting your nafs (desires) guide you is exactly what shaytan (satan) wants you to do."
1,poor customer service...,"I returned cd with damaged case over two weeks ago with invoice and did not receive credit to account or replacement of same item. The cd itself is great,but after being unable to get a response after sending (3)THREE E-MAIL inquiries(and no available phone number) from this company on status of refund or replacement,I would NOT RECOMMEND ORDERING from them simply because of extremely poor quality customer service for any such complaints"
1,Does not fit Britax Roundabout carseat,I bought this for my three yr old and it does not work at all. We have the Britax Roundabout carseat and there is not enough room for the pillow. I returned it.
2,Doesn't work well with certain carseats,"When my son was in a convertible car seat which was tilted back slightly and had head/side wings, this pillow worked well. It was propped well enough to support my son's head when he took a nap. But when we had to switch him to a straight-back booster seat that had shallow head wings, this pillow was not usable at all."
2,Probably not worth it,"I ordered this product for my 3 year old who just moved into a toddler seat and had head slumping problems! The two major problems with this product is that 1.) it's quite bulky, and so her head would tend to fall forward anyway, and 2.) check if it will fit in your carseat. I have the apex toddler seat that is quite wide, and you can't leave the pillows in place, they stand up at a 45 degree angle. I attached elastic to the bottom in order to fix them to the plastic that holds the seat pad in place. This works, but obviously only if you're sitting next to them when they fall asleep! Other than that you'd have to stop the car, get out and attach them, then go again, by which time the child is probably awake anyway! To be honest, I haven't seen a better alternative yet though. It's quite good to pull around and use as a pillow for your own head on long trips though!"
3,Toddler Head support,I didn't like this as much because it doesn't stay on my sons car seat. I do like it because the times my son has fallen asleep his head doesn't hang.
4,toddler coddler,This product was purchased because my granddaughter moved to a booster seat but had no place to rest her head. The toddler coddler greatly helped but I added a strap to hold the bottoms of the cushions in place. Problem solved.
3,Not Bad,"I love teas with mint, so I decided to give this one a try. Its really good and refreshing but the mint flavor isn't as strong as I would like to be. Not saying that it should be overbearing, but I had to question whether or not mint was even in the tea. All in all, its a good tea."
2,Only If Your Standards Are Low,"The premise is hard to swallow. A prestigious doctor and his research clinic publicly accuse a mother of killing her own child. They make the accusation despite the fact that they can't prove it and her husband is an attorney.When the attorney asks Lena Padgett to find out what evidence the clinic has, she indignantly refuses. However, she's willing to work for the wife, out of female solidarity. She still refuses to find out why the clinic says her client is a murderer.The story crawls. Every time the author introduces a new character, we get ten pages of dull, irrelevant backstory. The snail-paced narrative grinds to a dead halt. By page 100 (out of 300) the investigation hasn't begun. If an author isn't interested enough to get on with her own story, how can a reader trust that it's worth reading?"
3,Love Greenwood-but I like my mysteries SOLVED!,"I think I know who did the murder but the book never tells us. For that I found it disappointing. I love Kerry Greenwood and this book was great but I need to know for sure if who I think did it, did it!"
3,Weird Original Copy?,"It really surprise me, I got a DVD with a VHS quality material inside, just look good on my Ipod. It should say a DVD with old VHS quality Image"
1,not exciting,"I thought it would be cool music videos but no it's just ""How we Wrote This, How we wrote that, bla bla bla bla bla!"""
1,Safah 300TC Crimson Sheet Set,I was very disappointed in these sheets. After one washing they look like they have been used for years and have absolutely no body to them. The color faded and you can barely see the stripes.
2,Marginal Print Quality,"Since this DVD is shown as ""deleted,"" this review may be moot. In any event, I will limit my comments to print quality. The ""Werewolf"" print is better than I expected, with bright colors (usually), although pan & scan picture. However, the movie is listed elsewhere as having a running time of 96 minutes while the print used here is only about 74 minutes. From reviews of the uncut version, it appears much violence and nudity (!) have been excised. Also, there are no opening credits and the end credits aren't enough to identify the actors or title. There isn't enough here to justify purchase of the DVD for this movie alone. ""Moon of the Wolf"" is/was available on the same label coupled with another title. It is a better-than-average 1970s television horror movie, with the ever reliable David Janssen; however, the print quality is marginal--watchable, but no more.This is a dollar DVD. It isn't worth more."
2,two duds,'Moon' is a tv-type movie; 'Jekyll' is slow and boring---like most of Naschy's movies; that guy is so boring. 'Moon' is a tv-type movie; 'Jekyll' is slow and boring---like most of Naschy's movies; that guy is so boring.
3,PHILIP GLASS,"although the music is good, it is not what i expected, given that Philip Glass composed it, i suppose i expected more of Mr. Glass' style. it is an acceptable soundtrack not with standing."
4,Great!!!,"As usual, there's only one thing that could be said ""very good job Michael"". Thanks a lot for this piano transcription."
2,"Nice appearance, but break easily","I received a box of these cases and about 20 out of 100 were broken upon arrival because they are so fragile. If they are handled carefully, they work well, but the hinges are easily broken. Unfortunately, not a lot of selection on Amazon for this type of clear CD case."
3,"Great cases, bad shipping","The cases are great, slim and easy to use. However, I guess because I ordered two of these (200 cases) they sent them in the box they came in. So, there was no extra padding like there is when they pack the box for you. So, in all we lost about 20 cases to cracking and breaking. Since I had a project to do that needed 200 CD's, I didn't appreciate having to go out and buy 20 more at Staples!"
2,Good Price But....,The price of the product was great but quite a few of the jewel cases were damaged upon arrival. I am not sure if this was the fault of the shipping company or the deliverer but this brought the rating down.
1,Very Disappointing!,"Normally, Memorex jewel cases rate as one of the best cd/dvd cases out there. They are normally a lot better than Fellows or any of the other brands. Out of the 400 cases that I bought this time, at least 50 had broken pin hinges. And the cases did not seem to be as the same quality that I normally see in Memorex. I purchase at least 3,000 cases a year and the quality of this batch was really poor. I will not be making any future purchases from this supplier."
4,Does the job!,These cases worked just fine. The slim cases are a little less sturdy than the full-size jewel cases in my opinion but they take up less space which was why I ordered them. I bought 300 of these cases and had to return one of the packages because they were damaged in shipping but Amazon returned them really quickly so it was okay.
4,plain slim cases,"Nothing spectacular, nothing bad. They function as slim cases to hold/protect cd/dvds. I don't beat them up or try to wear them out, so they work fine. I did have 2 or 3 that were already broken (at the hinges) when I received them. But the other 90+ have been fine for holding archive discs."
2,Poor packageing by Memorex,This review is not of the disc but of the poor way they are packaged. There is only shrink wrap around two sides. There were a number of damaged cases. I did not even have to remove the shrink wrap to see the damaged ones. I should have listened to reviews that noted breakage. I do not think there is anything Amazon could have done. The reason is I have since purchased several 25pks from Office Depot and 3 out of 4 pks had the same problem. I returned them unopened to Amazon. Office Depot replaced them. I have to say the cases themselves are of great quality. Bottom line cases 5 stars packaging 1 star.
2,why crickets?,"Moonlight Sonata is a pleasant CD, full of recognizable (for me) pieces. However, in the background of the softer music, crickets are happily adding their contribution. I would hire the Orkin man to rid this CD of these pesky creatures. I assume the effect was supposed to be soothing. For me the opposite happened and the chirping was just plain annoying. If you can put up with the crickets, this is a lovely CD."
4,metal dancer displays; cute look,These displays give a nice appearance and trendy look. You have to be careful about people knocking them over; they are a bit unstable for heavy earrings.
4,A Long Time Fan's Testimonial,"I saw 7 Karma Fishes at the Berkeley Square in 1995, and in 96 or 97 I picked up Alone at a Tower Records in Concord.This is one of those albums (like Paul Simon's Graceland or Guns n Roses Appetite) that I just keep coming back to. Maybe six months will go by that I don't listen to it, but I always come back. Tracks from this album wind up on mix tapes, both for myself and others.The songwriting can be shaky at times (Skin and Serenity are the only tracks I skip, and both on account of the lyrics), but the vast majority of the album is a tight (super-tight) mix of facinating lyrics, sterling vocals, and sick instrumentation. The whole album is worth buying for Black Roses along, which has my favorite guitar solo in all of rock and roll (and this coming from a Stevie Ray fan!)"
4,Good Quality Exercise Ball,"I received this ball as a Christmas gift from my Amazon Wish List. The ball is good quality and was easy to inflate with the pump that came with the ball. The 55 cm size is a teal color.(Many balls do not come in the colors they are shown in!) It does not come with an intstructioal DVD as some others do, I would recommend purchasing an instructional DVD or tape if you are a beginner. The ball is a great adjunct to any exercise program."
1,Defective products,"Ordered this product along with the 65 cm as a gift. The 55 cm arrived without the plug, which I wouldn't have known without the other to compare it to, because there are no pictures of components. Attempted to inflate it anyway with the air pump to see if it works, and unable to inflate. Had to return the 65 cm one as it came in a crushed box with dents in the ball, and although I received a replacement rapidly, it also arrived in a crushed box, dented. Would definitely NOT order from this company again."
3,Not as shown,I ordered this one because of the color but received an ugly dark green one. I could have had one with a DVD for less if I had known that I wouldn't get the color pictured. Not happy !
4,Brewtown Ska IS Milwaukee Ska!,"Our First international release on Elevator Records. the Invaders are a 2-time WAMI award winning Milwaukee Ska band. This CD covers all our best songs and styles. 2nd wave influenced 3rd wave SKA. Fuel injected Ska blended nicely with some reggae grooves, Spanish influences and Punk. Be prepared to move your feet with this one! ""Taxes"" is a kickin' Reggae number and some nice slower Rock Steady style numbers, ""Who's With You"" and ""Elizabeth"" help round out this release from 1996. My faves are ""Ska Fever"" with an intro by Annette Funicello and the relationship inspired bonus track, ""Such A Jerk."" A great release by a Great Band from a Great City on a Great Lake! Keep on Skankin' ""BrewTown SKA!"""
5,"World's Greatest Comedians-- Redd Foxx, Jr. Samples, Gene Tracy Jr., Minnie Pearl, and Flip Wilson","This has Five Comedians on this CD. (1) Redd Foxx (2) Jr. Samples (3)Gene Tracy Jr. (4) Minnie Pearl (5) Flip Wilson. To get all of these Comedians on one CD is a great deal. Made by KING RECORDS - KSCD-1503. You will LOVE These Comedians on this CD. REAL FUN, FUN, FUN."
5,"EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED, WORKS PERFECT","THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED TO USE WITH MY EXISTING A T & T CORDLESS, 5.8GH PHONE SYSTEM! GOOD VALUE, RECEIVED QUICKLY, EXACTLY AS ORDERED, WORKS PERFECT!"
2,reliability problem,"I purchased this handset to go with my base unit in Aug 2007. A month later, it was dead (blank screen as described in other reviews). I returned it for a replacement and that one died less than a week later. I'm on my third one now and hoping it will last a long time. I've owned the base unit and its color handset for almost 3 years with no problems and I do like the phones.The handset gets a low rating because of reliability, but Amazon and the dealer get a high rating for service and ease of product exchange."
1,Disappointed,"The menu background is a dark green which makes it difficult to read. There is lighting above but not below, almost appears to be an error in manufacturing, they forgot the bottom lights! Also, they should have forgotten the images, not very creative."
5,quality phone,I have owned this phone for 3 years and have had absolutely no problems. The reception is always great and you can hear everything crystal clear. I am just adding a couple more expansion phones because we moved to a larger house. I couldn't be happier with this phone and I researched all the reviews before buying this system and I wasn't let down by all the positive reviews.
2,"Stone cold dies, but when it works, it's great.","Here's the trick: when it dies, charge the batteries in a different NiMH battery charger. You'll be good for another week or two, and then it will die again, and you'll repeat the process. Nice, eh? Not really. I love these phones when they work, especially the intercom feature, but something is really wrong inside to make them die like that with no warning."
1,Died in less than three months,I purchased this phone at the end of July and in early October it died. Stone cold dead. In the middle of a phone call. It's too late to return it to Amazon and I'm not optimistic about getting a replacement from AT&T.
5,AT&T Handset,This is exactly the same phone I ordered from AT&T at about half the price. I am very happy with it and the quick delivery.
3,Amateur documentary...be forewarned...!!,"This documentary seems to be shot by an amateur cameraman and narrator...so be prepared for less than ""fair"" production quality. Filmed in England at a swap meet/motorcycle auction. That said the motorcycles are great..!!!. Tons of old bikes on display with some very rare example of turn of the century motorcycles. If you can get past the amateur feel of the production, the DVD is great for the views of the old bikes."
2,The rising signs do not coincide with the birth chart and some birth years are not shown.,If you were to read the details concerning your Sun sign - it would be identical to the summaries in this book except they call it the Rising sign.
5,a must-have for sure!,"Very descriptive and in-depth explanation of the nature of the rising sign, one I have never came across to after all these years of studing Astrology. All other books on the subject mention the rising sign just as a mask, a core etc...While here the nature of the Ascendant is much more profoundly revealed and it becomes obvious its role is so not only superficial.I highly reccomend it!"
3,could have been more understanding,"well all i have to say is this book is ok. BUT where the problem lies is that this book seems to have been copied and pasted from the internets and whats more the birth time she gave on the beginning of this book is totally confusing to me. she broke it down into 15 days apart and tell us to interpolate between the two dates.other than that it's pretty spot on for me to say the least. if you're looking for an ascendant book with more, understanding and better anaylisis, look elsewhere. otherwise you'll be disapointed."
5,All great!,"Great service, great product. I bought these boots for my granddaughter's 4th birthday as part of her ""Jessie cowgirl"" outfit. She loves them and wants to wear them all the time, even to the pool!"
4,Cowboy boots,The product was excellent but the ship date was longer than expected. I think that before you actually pay for the item that the expected ship date should be available.
4,"""Sweets for the sweet""...a sweet treat of a book!","I had a student working on a report (actually it was his mother doing the inquiring, he was contemplating ""other things"") VEGETABLES.The last part of the project that was being worked-on was for a recipe. His topic was carrots. I hate to tell you what transpired during therecipe search, but he did not like carrot cake. The mother insisted that he did not need make it. He did not care whether he had to makeit or not, he sure did not want her to include that recipe!I wound-up ordering the attached list of books. They came into the library a week ago. What a great little series. Do take the time toperuse Amazon. They are a real ""repast!"""
3,Fun and fascinating in a way,"The author of ""A Tudor Story"" was an elderly clergyman who developed a fascination for Anne Boleyn early in the 20th century. He experienced a series of coincidences that led him to a succession of psychic mediums who all, in turn, and according to him with no knowledge of his fascination, channeled the spirit of Anne Boleyn during a number of sessions held in the 1920s and 1930s.The writing style is quaint, but all in all, the reading went smoothly. It was interesting material.With the rising interest in psychic mediums thanks to John Edward, this book should have some appeal. The author describes the various readings, and the things that Anne said to him.I actually enjoyed the book. It was rather fanciful, but like I said, who's to say? It's fun to imagine it as the final chapter in the sad story of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn."
2,pretty good blade/poor design,Quality blades and materials being used here.Bad points --No bottle opener - Has a can opener but no bottle opener for beers after a hard days work.-No Scissors-No locking blades - these nice blades will cut you.-Sloppy pliers - pretty strong but the 2 to 1 action is slow and cumbersome.-poor design - for example the little half inch knife blade has the edge on the wrong side so when you cut with it tends to close up on you (as opposed to open) with no blade lock how exactly are you going put any pressure on this blade without it closing up on you?-Sloppy - when you use the screw driver you can feel the blade wobble back and forth.-Pain in the grip - the pliers handles are not made with any comfort in mind as the metal edges dig into your hand making it impossible to take full advantage of the 2-1 leverage system. It hurts like hell to use this without some gloves on!Based on design alone - It's hard to take SOG seriously on this knife - I expected better..
3,Very theoretical,"A very theoretical discussion about different measurements. Not very much of practical value. But, if you're interested in these things, this is a really thorough book."
3,The title is on the mark,I ordered this book to learn more about all aspects of assisted living facilities and independent living facilities for the aging. This book covers it all--more than I really thought I needed!
4,Great For A Dwarf Hamster,"I like this cage because it is really easy to clean and doesn't take up much space and was very easy to put together. I would only recommend it for a dwarf hamster, I can't imagine a regular sized hamster being comfortable in there. I would have given it 5 stars if there were a way to connect it to other add-ons."
2,Looks nice but WAY TOO SMALL,"I purchased this cage today for my new hamster. It is way too small for her, and honestly I think it is too small for any rodent. I think you could use it as an add-on if you already have some other cages (i.e. connect with tubes) but as a single unit it is too small. I will be returning it to the store tomorrow and looking for a bigger cage for my poor little hamster."
2,Gerbils chewed this up - aquarium better!,"Our gerbils chewed through two of these, so I bought a cheap aquarium and purchasd a gerbil-cage aquarium top (cheap too) at Pet Smart. I filled 1/4 of the aquarium with the soft gerbil bedding (Carefresh), and our gerbils LOVE it! They dig tunnels, and make roofs for the tunnels out of the paper towel roles we give them. They they climb through the one plastic tunnel that comes with the cage top, and eat and run on their wheel on the top level. The kids love watching them run around, and now, whenever they hear us, they come up to the top and take treats from our hands. They are truly happy in this environment!"
5,An excellent resource for understanding the Old Testament!,This guide along with Celia Marshall's guide to the New Testament provides the reader with a clear understanding of the composition of the Bible. She also provides ways for the reader to interpret the Bible. I like the workbook format and the tear out pages. I am a pastor who teaches the Bible in a church. I use this guide often in my classes. I find Celia's explanation of things to make so much sense. I find that church people who use this guide on their own have a better understanding of the Old Testament. It makes my work easier when trying to explain difficult passages from the Old Testament to them. I would recommend this guide along with the guide to the New Testament to anyone who wants to know the Bible.
4,An Easy Method of Studying the Old Testament,A Guide Through the Old Testament which breaks apart its major areas so that the student can understand how to study this great volume of Jewish history and comprehend its important parts by completing the homework given with each section.
4,"\,,\ great deathgrind /,,/","First off you're getting 2 full lengths on 1 disc with this ""Best Of"" compilation (Infected + The Art Of Death). That in itself is a helluva deal.Next you're getting grade A, high quality death metal/grindcore. Honestly there is no way to dislike this CD if you're a fan of blastbeat death metal or grindcore.The entire disc sounds like Righteous Pigs meets Repulsion. You probably missed these guys the first time around back 2 decades ago so get it now. It's a fun ride and you'll need a rest after completion.For fans of: Cretin !- Jay in Texas"
2,"get info, then buy","well lenny - it's not the fault of this band if you bought a wrong record. this atrocity was formed in 1985 and released their demotape under the name atrocity also in 1985, 3 years before the first appearance of the german atrocity in 1988 with their first demo.so if you really think these guys have stolen the name of the german atrocity in order the cash money from people like you, than go and get infos first before you buy something - it is your fault.infected is from 1990 and the art of death from 1992, this is death/grindcore the old school way. surely not suited for fans of the german atrocity. but for fans of other classic bands in this vein like repulsion, master, deathstrike, righteous pigs, blood, terrorizer or even some napalm death - this is a worthy buy. it's good, but not a standout really."
4,retards need not write reviews.,"im glad people have touched on this already. uninformed morons slagging a band that was around before a band they like of the same name. anyhow, if you like repulsion i can recommend this. catchy and violent and a bit low fi. the demo came out around the time repulsion was called genocide and they share a similar sound. neither rips the other off however."
4,Morons on Amazon,What a bunch of idiots who reviewed this on Amazon. Do your homework kiddies. This is a grindcore record. Get it.
1,east coast trash,"This is trash-metal not thrash. This is not the same Atrocity from Germany, that gave us ""Blut"", ""Atlantis"", or ""Longing For Death"", This is a totaly a different band from the east coast hard core scene. Do not get burned and fooled by these guys. They are not that bad, but to be so ignorant and name yourself after another band so important in metal, I have to give it 1 star for not comin' up with your own band name,Who cares this came out in '85. Buyers beware and buy only authentic ATROCITY products.This is a Grindcore cd,but dont think this can stand next to Napalm Death,Repulsion or Carcass just a terrible conclusion.I can see why they waited so long. It didnt have a chance in 1985, so why try to cash in on the name now."
3,Using as textbook for computer security graduate class,"The book is easy enough to follow though some of the proofs are intricate and require a good math-head. Needs more real world examples. I'd also like to see a selected answers to end of chapter questions, too. The bibliography is extensive and thorough.There are a lot of errors and the reader should refer frequently to the author's online errata file.There IS NOT nearly enough room in the margins for notes and comments or cross-references. Textbooks need a lot of whitespace and this book doesn't have it.I'd have given a higher rating if there was more whitespace and fewer errors.BTW, seems like every comp sec instructor out there is using this book."
2,A book suitable for 1980's,"Security concepts dealt in this book are of early 1980's computer issues- it doesn't put much emphasis on the recent security technologies. Hard to read, hard to follow what the writer wants to imply. Had to buy this book for Security info systems engineering class at Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY- but didn't find any use. It's a total junk for the price. Doesn't include any security tool in a cd, nor does it talks about practical usage of such software. Try buying Hacking Exposed book for a lot cheaper."
5,favorite piano artist,"This is a very soothing,relaxing and uplifting cd. I put it in on the way home from work (30 minutes)and it takes away some of the anxiety of the day. I have 2 of her other cds and love them."
2,Good for first 7 months,"I purchased this monitor in August 2007. It was great out of the box. No dead pixels, awesome color, and I was very pleased. I never used the speakers so I don't have an opinion of them.After having the monitor for 7 months is images on the screen began to have a ghost duplicate to the right, causing everything to look blurry, and unfocused. I contacted customer service who suggested that I needed to update my computer. Instead I tried the monitor with 3 other laptops, all with the same problem. Because of headaches, I'm unable to use it at all and have had no success getting it replaced. I will need to purchase a new monitor, as this one is one is impossible to look at for very long."
4,"V7 22"" Monitor","I have been using this monitor for about three weeks and it is a great deal! The silver finish makes it look like a more expensive model. Sharpness, Color and ease of set up are all exceptional. My only complaint is that the Contrast is a little dark even after calibration. I would recommend this for anyone who wants a basic home monitor that is stylish and light weight. if you are a design professional I would probably recommend another brand with better contrast controls."
2,Not to happy,I thought the price of the product was reasonable but the quality was not. The integrated speakers were very quite even though I increased the factory set volume from 50% to 100%. I could hardly hear anything.The other problem was with the text. I had a very difficult time reading the text on the screen. It was not even close to being sharp. The proper resolution adjustments were made but to no avail.
2,Average,"Everybody Says you get what you pay for and this is no exception. I purchased this item to get the big 20"" TV out of the bedroom that I had hooked up to my MCE 2005. It is def an improvement in the amount of space that it takes up. However the screen doesn't seem to support widescreen resolutions when viewing TV. If I set it to a widescreen res it would fliker and then just go blank. It works fine on the normal 4:3 ratio res which I currently have it setup for 1024 x 768 and I no this is on the low side but I am not using this monitor for anything other than watching tv. Once again I would just like to reiterate that I was disappointed that this monitor would not work in its widescreen resolutions in Windows Media Center."
3,Theyll do.,Upon getting the gloves I was excited to test them out. After wearing them for a few minutes I noticed that the leather was starting to wear. I have no complaints since I'm only going to be using these for winter but I might avoid turtleskin gloves in the future after seeing how they started to wear after simply putting them on. They'll do their job for me but I doubt I'll be buying a ts product ever again.
5,For Every Christian Tired of Division,"Author Gene Shelburne presents a powerful case for oneness among all believers and shows the folly of Christians maintaining separateness over differences in biblical interpretation or denominational practice. After digesting this clear and easy-to-understand treatise, readers will realize that the enemy is not the rival denomination down the street, but a primeval adversary to whom Christians must present a united front if the name of Christ is to achieve its full effect in our deteriorating world. This book is a ""must-read"" for every Christian interested in breaking out of separatism, and for every church leader who wants to do his part in seeing the body of Christ grow healthy and strong.--Thomas Williams, co-author (with Josh McDowell) of In Search of Certainty"
3,Jasmine is a shill,"Please read all Jasmine's reviews. They are all identical. I don't know if this is a good computer or not, but Jasmine is posting spam."
3,new Spinetta,"Although stated everywhere as being 2006 release this album was recorded and released in 2005. Here we find a new personnel (except Cardone on keyboards). Spinetta keeps his standart on the same level as before. No hits, but elegant playing and nice listening. 63 minutes long. Nice package as always. 3 1/2 out of 5 stars."
5,Must have to install an after-market stereo,"Please note that for 2007 Dodge Grand Caravan, do not buy the item Metra 70-6522. This is the correct one.Installation notes for sharing:[...]"
5,Perfect,Works great. I bought to installBoss615UA MP3 Compatible Solid State AM/FM Receiverin my girlfriend 2005 PT Cruiser and worked perfect.
1,A Romance Junkie,"Joanna was raped by two men one week before her wedding to the handsome and rich alpha male Alessandro- Sandro. She told no one of her ordeal and went ahead with the wedding. Who does that?? I mean, you have to be off your rocker to begin with to pull that off. I didn't like Joanna, and I never warmed up to Sandro either. She was understandably nuts and he was just a sap. It took me a week to read this book because it's not easy reading thoughts from a crazy person. She was a bore. I don't recommend this book at all. Raped by two men! honestly this was a bit too much reality for me."
2,SUCH A SLOW BOOK!!,I could not get through this book fast enough! The good points of this book was was that Michelle Ried actually stepped out side of the box with this book. The H showed his love for the h and was not ashamed of his feelings for the h. OK now the bad points! The books was SLOW! VERY VERY slow. I am big on closure! this book lacked so much of it! I wished M. Reid had went it to some detail at least on some closure for the h. as far as the bad guys went. Like why didn't she report the incident? were the bad guys ever punished?? were they ever caught?? I mean something so traumatic you can not just simply forget about it in 3 years! but it was a endearing story. Not the normal Harlequin Present Romance book. Usualy M. Reid books she shows the H and H with so much more character. I feel that this book lack so much of that!
3,be aware of durability issues,"first of all, these are some of the best headphones money can buy, however, UE has severe problems in my opinion when it comes to cable durability, i am a producer, and music professional, and use these every day, i also have used the shure e3c in the past and various types of etymotic. i own a pair of triple.fi and these super.fi, i use the triple.fi mainly for working out, listening to ipod, etc. and use the triple.fi for work. however, these have not proven to be durable when it relates to being in the gym. i am not the kindest to these as they are my workhorse pair, so often i would roll them up and place them in my bag, however, beyond that, i did nothing out of the ordinary with them, and have suffered from a broken cable leading up to the left ear, and the cable coming loose from the right ear monitor. i definetly recommend these, with a warning, be prepared, almost no matter what. a year from now, to be calling ultimate ears needing a replacement cable."
1,They are good while they last,"This is the second pair of these that I have bought, and although they are good headphones they break fairly easily. I have not had much luck getting my money back for these. Until I get my replacement review stands!!!"
1,Don't break the cable,"Warning - One key attraction is the ability to replace the cable should it break... why spend over $200 on headphones and have to toss them for a failure in a $3 cable? Well, for now it looks that this is indeed the situation. My cable just broke and I cannot locate a replacement cable anywhere (well, found one in London for something like $65). The company doesn't even have email support to ask the question, the link goes to a non-functional Logitech page as of 10-13-09. I've loved the sound, but buyer be aware that a simple cable break may make this a very expensive and frustrating experience. If the manufacture isn't willing to sell a $3 replacement cable for $20 on their own website it makes me wonder if they will honor warranty."
1,Horrific customer support,"If you expect a quality support team standing behind a $259 set of earphones, you would be sadly mistaken. Today I spent 22 minutes on hold with the RMA call center only to be told I need to call ""Sales"" for info that pertains to my original purchase. RMA Service does not link with sales but someone in sales would ""get right back to me"" by the end of the day. Granted, I would be on my way with the replacement had I saved my receipt but you would think I was asking them to replace my car.Not sure if it is a result of them being Logitech or what but I would never do business with Ultimate Ears again."
4,Great Product for the Money,"The audio quality of the Ultimate Ears Super.fi 5 Pro Earphones (I have the clear model for stage work) is very, very good. This compares with double the price for a Shure product. My only criticism is that even though the buds come with various size pieces, I still find them a bit uncomfortable and they will pop out on occasion, even though I've secured them properly. But again, for the price....I can live with this and recommend them."
4,Clarity,"The best way to describe these monitors is that they are clear. If you have an excellent source, these headphones offer you a lot of sounds that you've never heard before. They are definetly flatter than the Shures. That means less treble and more bass than the Shure's, as my interpretation goes. I'm not an audiophile but the sound is very good, very clear, and the stable over all volumes. Comfort is lacking compared to the Shures in my opinion so I took a star away for that. The headphones are larger than the Shures and are more rigid around the ear, which is nice actually since putting them on quickly is easier. If a smaller foam insert was included with the larger insert that would've been nice.N."
1,Great sound but poor build quality,"These earbuds sound really nice, probably the best sounding pair I have owned.Hopever, I found them to be quite uncomfortable and hard to fit compared to the humble koss plug or the more expensive Entymotic.The cable seems tough, but it has a strong PVC smell for the first few months which eventually fades, however it is stiff and prone to cracking.The build quality is quite poor, the bass driver on my right earpiece broke after 10 months, the cable covering broke around the same time.Despite the advertised 2 year warranty, I was unable to get a response to my RMA request from the ultimate ears website after two separate attempts over a 1 month period.And they do not sell spare earbuds for their products either. Cusotmer support leaves a lot to be desired.Not recommended."
4,"Superb sound, but slightly uncomfort","The sound is superb! You'll hear what you've never hear with these earphones. I'm not sure if my problem has anything to do with the earphone, but I think it causes me a little headache. Maybe because it was too tight when I plugged it into my ears. Yes, it helps blocking the noise outside, but at the same time it causes a pressure in the ears.And don't buy the white ones. The photos don't justify the real. The plastic looks cheap. If I can change, I would rather go for the clear or the red ones."
4,"Great Sound, Poor Fit.","So they sound great and block out a ton of sound, that is when they are in your ear. I use these as in-ear-monitors as a drummer and they work great for about songs then I have to shove them back in my ear. I have tried the different fittings and none of them seem to keep them in. They do not fall out, but they come loose so outside sound pours in audio becomes hard to hear.When they are in all the way, they are great. But they only stay that way for a short time.I recommend two different paths. Get the Super.fi.3 and see how those go and then you will realize that down the road, you will want to get custom fit ones. Or get a different brand that will fit better.Good sound will only work if the earphone stays in your ear."
4,A bit more bass,"Excellent in-ear phones for all types of music. Just wish bass was a bit deeper. Definitely get the extra warranty, I'm not sure how long the metallic loops will last. Great improvement over my Sure E2c's."
5,"Great fit, build, and SOUND! REVISED see comment","There have been many good reviews of these great phones. I'm no expert, but I like good sound and was able to upgrade to these from the Sennheiser PX-100, thanks to a friend. These are an incredible upgrade. I found an easy and intuitive fit with the medium silicone tips. I can't believe how much lower I play my Creative Zen Vision:M now with these (level 10 now, max versus 20). I find the bass to be good, and all frequencies are well reproduced at all sound levels. My Mp3 collection was ripped at a high quality level so I am not noticing problems with my files. I am am noticing much more detail in the music though. I love listening to music on Metrorail (DC subway system) as they block out so much of the noise. I find the cord to be a bit annoying, rigid and getting caught, but that may reflect more our cold temps since I have gotten these. In any case, that cord does give me confidence in the build quality of that cord, heavy duty! Highly recommend."
5,Excellent Mid-Priced Buds,"This is my first set of ear buds that cost over $40 and I must say, for the money they are worth every penny. Let me start by saying when I first tried them the music on my Sony minidisc player never sounded so bad. Bad? Yes, bad. By default, I was getting 128K compression which I understand is the standard these days. Let me say that with good head phones 128K sounds pretty bad. The very high frequencies, especially pronunciation of S in the lyrics is quite distorted. I reloaded several CDs using minimum compression of 352K and there was a remarkable difference. The head phones REALLY sound great. I will now be happy to give up the quantity of tunes I can hold for the quality of having less compression. I highly recommend UE's Super.fi 5 Earphones, but be prepared to decrease your compression factor."
3,Beware of this product,"I don't know what happened with my pair, since I've been reading such glowing reviews from everywhere. Indeed, getting a seal is a breeze, the headphones are very comfortable and produce extremely good sound. However, I've only had my pair for three days, and the left speaker is already busted. I will be returning these...I need a more reliable pair of headphones."
1,Fragile Equipment-HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I bought this head set this summer and one ear piece fell off after using it maybe 5-6 times. I returned it for a replacement set. Logitech (they own Ultimate Ears) sent me the wrong replacement set..So I paid to return the wrong set and received an e-mail they'd received it and were processing the correct set and would e-mail me when it was shipped. Six days later I replied to them I'd received neither an e-mail nor a head set. They didn't have the courtesy to reply to my e-mail. So I called them, now 10 days after their e-mail. Still being ""processed"". I asked to speak to a supervisor, and was told they'd leave a msg for the supervisor to call me within 48 hours. this company has no concept of customer service. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
2,Beware the larger size,"I am a fan of in-ear headphones. My personal favorites are the Shure E4C. I also own the Etymotic E6i and these UE Super Fi 5s. My experience with this model was very unhappy. The dual driver design makes the earphone a larger diameter, and even with the smallest rubber ends on these phones, the fit is too tight to be bearable for more than a few minutes. I've never had a problem with other in ear phones.Before you buy these, make sure there is an option to return them. I am stuck with mine. Bummer..."
4,"very nice sound, but clumsy to use","I like these headphones for their good sound, and am glad that they are not completely noise-canceling since I like to have some sense of what's going on outside my head. But I also find them clumsy to put on because of the wrap-around ear piece. They are, for the same reason, clumsy to store. Overall, I'm not 100% sure they were worth the ~$180 that I paid for them, but I am certainly happy with the sound quality."
1,faulty earphone,"The very expensive earphones purchased via AMAZON came apart, (wire fell out off ear piece) only a few weeks after purchase. The manufacture is faulty and thus the earphones are not worth the very expensive price paid."
2,Overpriced and poor build quality,"These earphones are way overpriced for the money and if you're not an audiophile (I'm not) and all you want are a solid pair of portable headphones that block out noise, provide sound as good as the apple earphones, and are built to last, then these are NOT the earphones for you. The customer service is poor and they refuse to take ownership of the fact that the cable on these earphones breaks very easily. The other extremely annoying thing is that the cable does not hang down like normal wire, but rather acts more like a slinky. Bottom line: you can get the same quality or better for less than half the cost. Steer clear."
5,Great product,I listened to a lot of different earphones and I know sound is personal preference but I love these earphones. I found that the volume level is so much lower using these earphones and the sound is crisp and clear. I have 2 friends who used my earphones (they come with several adaptations) and they are purchasing their own now.These block out airplane noise making my travel much more relaxing.I am very happy with the product.
5,Ultimate Ears Super.fi 5 Pro,"I have owned this product for 1 month and I am very pleased with these earphones. Excellent audio quality as long as you take the time to fit them to your ears properly, there are 5 pair of different rubber/foam ear pieces to accomplish this. Sometimes I use some EQ on my iPod and sometimes not, depending on my mood. Walking on the treadmill listening to ZZ Top greatest hits take 2 with the EQ set to R&B is pretty much da bomb for me. Does need to be ""cranked up"" a little to be appreciated fully. Sounds very much like my well equalized tri-amped PA system in a personal form factor."
2,noise reduction is not there,"The ear buds have a big problem - it is hard to have a perfect fit. If you do not have a perfect fit, you do not get noise reduction. As it is, they would not stay in my canals, and after a few hours my ears could not take them at all. So even though they are great as headphones, they are not for an airplane travel."
2,I must have been unlucky,"After reading the reviews, I figured these were just what I was looking for. However, the pair I received has really poor sound quality. There was a significant amount of distortion."
3,Very disappointing,"I had great expectations from all the raves I found online for these, but I was hugely disappointed when I heard them. The lows are fine, the mids are fine, but the highs are just awful. Almost entirely missing. They have no brilliance at all. I've been trying many different earbuds over the last several years (Sony, Shure, Panasonic, Creative, among others), and these are the most expensive AND least impressive. I'm going back to my $30 Panasonic RP-HJE300."
2,They keep breaking,"I've gone through two pairs of these, and both broke in the same exact way. The part of the earbuds that the wire plugs into came out completely, taking the ""guts"" of the earbuds with it. I'm pretty furious right now, in fact, because I'm very careful with how I treat the earbuds, and I can't believe I had two pairs break in the same exact way!On a plus note, I gave them an extra star because they do sound great while they work."
2,"Excellent sound, moderate quality, poor customer service","These headphones sound fantastic and they do a good job of isolating outside noise. The metal storage case they come with is convenient to carry, easy to use and protects the headphones nicely. Unfortunately, after about two years of occasional use (I only use them when I fly - about 20 flights per year) the left pod cracked and stopped working. After four calls to Ultimate Ears Customer Service over a six week period, leaving four messages asking for a return call, I've not received a reply and I'm left with a $250 mono phone. Poor customer service is inexcusable, these will be replaced with Shure SE310s."
2,UE Super fi 5 Pros....Great if they fit,"Yes, I did my research and yes, I was aware that some had fit issues with these. Without any quantification of their size or the size of my ear canal I opted to make the purchase. Well, even with the smallest tip I found myself exerting a large amount of pressure to get these things in my ears. Now, even though there was a good deal of physical discomfort for me I can't deny the veils these earphones removed from the music while listening through them. Unfortunately I could not listen for longer than a few minutes at a time and even when the 'phones were removed there was a lingering tingle/burning in my ears. Too bad about the fit because these 'phones offer an excellent musical experience."
3,"they're OK... if you're a runner, the earphones come off.","I bought these eraphones cause Im a runner... so I was looking for good audio for my 2+ hour long runs.. well the earphones sound GREAT, the bass is awesome... you won't hear any other noise.. but if you run, the earphones will come out of your ears... I was hopping they would hold.. i have to adjust them evry 10-15 min. I do have to admit, everyone's ears are different..."
3,Not as impressed as everyone else,"Maybe I'm missing the boat on this, but I don't see what everyone else is so geeked about with these. I gave them a shot, based on all the positive reviews, but now I see what the few complaints were about. The bass response is somewhat feeble. I watched the instructional video, and jammed these things as far as I could into my ears. I experimented with every size insert, but at best, they sounded the same as my Sony MDR-EX71SLA earbuds, which are about one-fifth the price, and require far less effort to insert into your ears. I couldn't justify spending that much money on something that didn't sound any better. Maybe my ears just aren't 'sophisticated' enough, or the music I listen to doesn't do justice to the greatness of these headphones, but to me, they're not worth the price."
5,The best,I have tried most all of them and for a few dollars more these are by far the best sounding. Great bass response and full tonal range. They are also comfortable to wear.
5,Excellent fidelity and a comfortable fit.,"After a great deal of research, I purchased these headphones. I don't regret the decision in the least. My only complaint, and it's a very minor one, is that it was initially difficult in deducing the left phone from the right. Great sound, much better than my Sure E2Cs."
3,UE Super fi5 Pro Earphones have won me over,"Thought they were a bit expensive until I tried them out. I am NOT someone who knows the finer points about the performance of the headphones, I can just say that to me they sounded great. They fit well and have lived beyond my expectation.UPDATE: After having these headphones for over a year the ear bud housing cracked and UE would not replace. I truly did love them, but for the cost hoped they would last. I took very good care of them and they did not break due to neglect. I did find a wonderful replacement. Altec Lansing bought out UE and offers their own, much cheaper version. See my review there. I downgraded from 5 stars to 3 based on the product breaking and the company (UE) not replacing them. The company I purchased them from sent the product quickly and arrived as advertised."
2,"great sound, poor quality","Have owned these earphones for 3 years. While the sound is great the hardware quality is suspect. The cords have been replaced on two occasions and one of the earpieces now has very low volume. Ultimate ears informed me that they don't repair their product but will sell me a new pair abiet for a 50% per cent discount + 15.00 shipping.The earphones original cost was over $200.00, one would expect better quality and endurance for that price. These earphones were treated with kid gloves .If you don't mind replacing expensive earphones every couple years go for these, the sound is great.The company Ultimate Ears uses for its first line of defense from customers is worthless. Go straight to corporatewith problems, which you will have.$200.00 + for 3 years is not a very good cost to benefit ratio."
2,Low Durability,I'm going to keep it simple:+Great sound quality and noise isolation+Decent transportability-BREAKS VERY EASILY with normal use (as of now both sides of mine are covered in epoxy due to the plastic breaking and I even had to take a soldering pen to one side) If not for this my review would be a 5/5.
3,Ultimate Ears,"Good sound. But were cutting in and out of left channel. Company still hasn't taken care of it. Expensive, but I am disappointed that they were defective out of the box."
4,top notch sound,Not the easiest to use or the most comfortable but the sound is great for an ear bud.
3,Ultimate Ears Super fi. 5 Pro,"This is my first and last time buying anything from Ultimate Ears. I am a college student who listens to hardcore rock music and was looking for a set of headphones that i would be able to listen to very loudly without sacrificing quality. I am extremely disappointed in these headphones because they are first, very uncomfortable. While they do stay in place very well if you wear them around your ears, they hurt your ears after one or two hours in place. I also felt like i had to jam them into my ear canals in order to get annnyyyy kind of bass. Seriously, i have no clue why anyone would buy these... if anyone disagrees with me they must listen to classical music with low volume for no more than an hour. For the price, I implore you to spend your cash elsewhere."
3,Not bad...a little pricey for what you get,"Pros - good high end sounds, comfortable. They take a bit of getting used to but after wearing a few times you don't notice them. Great for workouts as they don't fall out like other typesCons - base was pretty weak w/o much punch to it. I also don't like the cord..way too much memory.I think for the money there's probably a different pair of headphones out there with more bang for the buck"
3,"Nice ear buds, maybe overpriced",I like the sound from these. I still have yet to find a in ear model that does not want to fall out. Maybe I am too critical or I have not been using them correctly but overall I like them. Maybe I should spring for the custom models. I would have preferred white but could not resist the price difference with the clear. The cord could be longer like the Apple original ear buds. Also the L and R markings are all but invisible.
4,Can't truly review this yet.,"I purchased these after reading all the other reviews. I am certain that these are quality in ears but my ear canals are so small, none of the tips will work. I am going to have them fitted with custom moldings soon and that should make a big difference. Other than that, the packaging, overall sound from what I can gather and the case is all very cool."
1,One star is too much for this product - DON'T BUY THESE,I purchased these earphones on the basis of the many positive reviews. Worst earphones I've ever experienced. I asked two friends to try them just to get their feedback - worst earphones they ever used. After having the Bose headphones I didn't expect that quality but they are awful. I purchased these to have a set of earbud style in addition to the Bose. Returned them two days later and purchased some high-end Sony earbuds that are great. Even the construction of these with the ridiculous wiring looks like someone made them in their garage. Buy Bose or Sony but avoid these and don't buy into the reviews... something is wrong here.
4,swichted from Ety's ER-6i,"I bought this product to get a better sound than with my ER-6i that I used before. And the sound quality is much better with these.But why 4 stars instead of 5?Thats because the fit isn't as nice as my old Ety's, you don't feel the Ety's, even after a couple of hours. These are just bulkier and I didn't find the perfect sleeve for my ears. At the moment I'm switching between the 2-flange and the smallest normal ones to find a comfy fit. And as they were much bigger than the Ety's they stick out from the ear quite a bit..."
4,Good and Great!,"So I have been using in-ear headphones for about 5 years now cause I am a drummer and I do some studio work on the side for local bands. I am pretty tough on equipment so I have always bought cheaper headphones cause they break fast and within the warranty. First time I bought these I love them! Two speakers controlled with a passive crossover gives those highs and lows, and in general the mids fill out because of such. The only real problem I have with these headphones (and this is the ONLY problem): where the cable attaches to the earphone the mount piece between the cable and earphone can come undone and can rip out which takes the small cables inside with it and destroy the earphone. I have had this happen twice but within warranty limit. So overall if you have the money I would recommend them"
2,Cord Problems,"I have been very happy with the audio quality, although I do frequently wish for some more bass. HOWEVER, the cables are shoddily soldered and I have had two give out on me. Each time costs me $20 plus shipping - a tax that I hadn't planned on paying to Logitech. Customer support does not answer the phone in a reasonable time and I no longer have the serial number so I can't even request by internet.My advice is to keep shopping. My next pair will be from a smaller company that cares enough to answer the phone."
5,I'm on board,"Ultimate Ears Super.fi 5 Pro Earphones (White)I've had a pair for these for almost three years and they're fantastic. A shell case cracked after the first year and Ultimate Ears sent me a whole new pair. I've never had any other problem and I'm still amazed by the fidelity. It is necessary to get these into your ear canals to hear the bass, but when you do, it's there! I also discovered that by bending the around-the-ear piece to exert a little pressure inward, it helps keep them sealed nicely. I would buy these again in a minute!"
5,"Great tool, good cutting power!","This tool is great for anyone who spends time outdoors, I'm a rancher and the tool is an invaluable asset to my way of life. The cutting part of the pliers will easily cut barbed wire with minimal hand strength. the knife cuts well, but isn't the best knife blade in the world. The price here was great, the free shipping makes it a great deal."
5,Great SoG Multi-Tool,"This SOG is my favorite, it does everything I need it to. I will however buy a V-cutter and Straight Blade for it, but those are my preferences. The power lock on this tool is amazing I will never pinch my finger again!"
1,What a piece of junk,"Bought this to replace my 10-year-old Leatherman PST II, which is worn but still functional after daily use all these years.Right out of the box, one of the SOG's tool covers fell right off. The other followed a couple of days later. I didn't really mind that because they're useless and in the way, and the tool is better off without them. But the VERY FIRST TIME I used the phillips screwdriver, on the third screw the driver head snapped right in half. $65 down the toilet - I've rarely been so cheated."
3,Pros & Cons,"Love the ease in opening this Pliers. The ""locking"" mechanism does not inspire much confidence. Even if you manage to lock the blades in place it doesn't take much to force it closed. I prefer the locking mechanism on my Leatherman Supertool which is rock solid. Because of this it sits in my drawer. Really wanted to like it."
1,Not as pictured.,"I THOUGHT I was ordering the tool pictured but ""Sold by: Amazon.com LLC "" sent me an older model. It does not have the covers over the gears. I like to carry my multi-tools in my pocket and these gears tear holes in pockets. I'd be returning it on principle alone (not sending what they claim to be selling). But it's also much larger and heavier than the Leatherman Wave. Add to this the fact that I was hesitant to purchase from Amazon anyway given the deplorable working conditions of their warehouse employees and this seals the deal. My money goes elsewhere from now on."
3,I've seen better,I bought this for my father for Father's Day since he does a lot of his own home repairs and he seemed to like it well enough. I asked him recently about it and he said it worked well enough but the different tools didn't lock in the open position. This is an accident waiting to happen.
4,B quality,"I recieved a b quality item not good enough to be sold by any official sog source, I still love the tool and have used it without problems, I took the covers off they seemed extra. Badly dented the plier cutters cutting romax cable, very soft metal used here.All the laser etching was very bad.The tool was very stiff can barely open with one hand but this is fine it doesn't open on accident"
4,Here it is,Let me start by saying i had a sog power assist before I unlike some others got the coverd gears model in three days good job amazon I like it the covers are a little complacated but I like the full handle feel when using pliers over all was a good buy for under sixty
2,Old model not as good as updated version,"I purchased and promptly returned this particular product. Pliers and overall construction are good; however, there is a distinct difference between the old and new model variants. This difference lies in the locking mechanism used to lock all of the tools in place. The one I purchased came with a single button. My understanding is that the newer models have a ""piano hinge"" style locking mechanism which locks each tool independently. I have the powerassist version which has that mechanism and it is far superior to the singular button. In short, great tool, but make sure you get the updated version."
5,HQ SOG,"This SOG multi-tool is a typical, high quality product from SOG. It's durable, well constructed, and precision fitted. It even allows dis-assembly to replace any worn or broken tools... (very nice). I especially like the lock feature, so I'm positive not to inadvertently have any sharp edges fold back onto my finger. - (I can't remember SOG cutting corners in construction or design, or putting out a chinsy product with anything I've ever purchased from them.)"
3,It Broke,"The first time I used the phillips head it broke, and I barely cranked it. I know it has a warranty but I don't want to deal with it. They were smart with the flat head, they give you more than 1 of those. Everything else is superior to any other multi tool i have seen and all of my co workers have one i can compare to. If it didn't break so easily, this would have been a 5 star review. Sorry guys."
2,There must be something better,Bought the black oxide coated model with power lock and the spike for breaking out windows. Hate it.The so called pivoting handles snap off nearly everytime I try to open any blade and I have to put them back on again...terrible design.The file doesn't even file fingernails but will leave a nice strip of the black oxide coating on whatever you try to file. Black oxide coating comes off easily.Blade is sharp but it is hard to just open one blade or screwdriver as they open together and then you have to unlock them one at a time to put them back before using the blade.The additional torque offered by the SOG cam system is great but probably for the average joe's use not that big of a deal.My friends have other brands and I wish I had gotten theirs.
1,"Pliers Great, tools suck","Hey all, first off, I am very much a fan of SOG's products, but this one did not measure up. The pliers are fantastic, but I didn't spend 60 bucks for a pair of pliers, I paid for a multi-tool. The problem is the locking mechanism on the tools. I'm not sure if it's just mine, but a lot of them won't lock in, including the knife blade, and that one I need locked in. Also the sheers, need to be locked in to operate and they do not lock without considerable effort, but you'll need a second pair of pliers to get it to close. I sent it back to SOG, and about 20 bucks later in shipping charges, I got it back with the same flaws as when I sent it. Like I said, I'm normally a fan of SOG, but clearly I'll be looking elsewhere for multi-tools in the future."
1,Not the powerlock 2,After my original powerlock shattered i bought a powerlock 2. what arrived was a original powerlock with a c-4 spike. Not very happy at all i returned the unit and was refunded promptly
2,Great music but no words,"This CD is a great example of traditional mountain songs being played by traditional mountain instruments. However, I bought this CD assuming that, in addition to the great music, I would also have a chance to learn all the words to so many of the old songs that I haven't been able to find anywhere else. Unfortunatly, this CD is entirely instrumental. There are no words. If you are looking for an instrumental CD, this is a great buy. But, if you want to learn the words to these great old songs, look elsewhere because this CD is no help."
4,great old music,The CD is music I haven't heard in years. I have really enjoyed listening to these songs again. Received promptly. Enjoyed instantly.
4,Too Many Different People,This Cd reminds me of many different people's voices including Kim Carne; Bonnie Raitt; The Judds; Nora Jones & Adele! It's a hit!
4,One hell of a good Story,"This is her best work. The first four songs are all home runs. Turpentine is a piece of pop art, My Song is as aggressive as anything she has done. There's a bit of filler later on in the album, but This is definitely my favourite of hers."
3,OKAY BUT NOT GREAT,"So many reviews of this CD are glowing, but I review it with more reserve. It is an OKAY follow-up to the incredible first release ""Brandi Carlile,"" but it lacks the luster of the first CD.Without a doubt the best song on the CD is ""The Story."" The remaining 13 songs are more of the folk genre and none of them really stand out. I say 13 because if you let track 13 continue to play there is an extra song.This CD was recorded in 11 days and I could tell. Some of the songs just seem thrown together.""The Story"" is a folksy/blues mix which is great if you are into that genre of music. I lean strongly toward rock. If you prefer the folk genre you will probably love this CD."
3,This one's a grower,"Having loved Brandi Carlile's first CD, I had high hopes for her follow-up. Initially, however, I was disappointed at the definite move towards a Country music style in this album. It's a lot more 'twangy' than the rock and rawness of the first album. ""The Story"" has grown on me in subsequent listenings, but I think it's going to remain a firm second-best to her wonderful debut CD."
3,"Okay, but not that great...","I bought this CD because I really liked Brandi Carlile's single, The Story.That song is still great, but none of the other songs particularly impressed me. They weren't bad, but not my favorite. Her style is a mix of pop/rock and country, so if you are a fan of country music you may like it more. It was little too country for me."
3,OK Story,"I bought this cd after hearing the song ""The Story"" used on a TV spot for some doctor show, but it didn't say who was playing the song, so I had to google some to find out. Anyway, the rest of the cd is ok, there are some good songs, but the highlight is ""The Story"" and ""Have You Ever"". Would love to hear Brandi Carlile live though, and I will if I ever get the chance."
5,"Powerful, evocative stories of life lived",One of the most emotional and communicative pieces of music and songwriting I have heard in a long time. This woman knows life and gives voice to her life and her lessons. Her songs unleash your heart and allow the tears to flow. It's beautiful.
4,Breathtaking,This is such a beautiful album. She has an angelic voice that I would describe as Joni Mitchell meets Sarah McLachlan. The perfect relaxing album or driving music. The only thing that keeps this from a 5-star is the monotony of the overall sound. Not a lot of music or voice diversity here.
3,This story isn't that great,The first three tunes are great - the rest of the album turns into Indigo Girls type rock - what happened to the Brandi Carlile from her first album? I guess these were the tunes thrown out and T-Bone Burnette was called to save the day - which he didn't do. Typical sophomore slump album.
3,"Unfortunately, this is a typical sophomore effort.","The first time I popped her debut album into the CD player, I had to listen to the whole thing. THen listened to it again. And again the next day. Simply, Brandi's first album is fantastic. Unfortunately, where that album was cohesive, this one seems completely unsure of itself. Perhaps that was the intent, but IMO, you have to take it on a song-by-song basis to get any satisfaction. I appreciate that the sound is perhaps a little matured, but certainly only sophomoric at best. I wish that there were more songs on it with the ""Radiohead-with-a-female-vocalist"" sound as in the title track. I'm hoping that the next album will have pulled together a bit better...with better songwriting, maybe?"
2,Falls short,saw Brandi in person-energetic and focused. This CD is somewhat depressing and lacks memerable songs despite the effort.
4,Brandi Carlile Review,This little lady really can sing. The Story is an excellent example of an outstanding voice. The title cut caught my attention during a commercial and won me over.
5,A Great Second!,"Brandi Carlile's second album takes you like a tropical storm and settles you to a poetic calm. The title track ""The Story"" is sang like an anthem, when she wails "". . . all the lines on my face tells the story tells you the story of who I am. . . "" you get shivers. She has such a powerful voice.This is a great second album and is consistently fantastic like her debut. From the first track ""Late Morning Lullaby"" to ""Have You Ever,"" this CD is very much country- folk infused with the strong vitality of vintage rock and roll. Its an impressive sophomore effort. Most of the songs are written by Carlile with her famous cohorts, the Hanseroth twins contributing intermitently. They also are provide all the musical instrumentations. It's an impressive feat, so one must wonder is Brandi putting out too much, too early at such a young age, will she continue to be creative and exiciting? Lets enjoy ""The Story"" and ponder this later."
5,The Best Yet,"""The Story"" is by far the best collection of songs by Brandi Carlile I've heard. From the first track ""Late Morning Lullabye"" which opens with the line ""As soon as my eyes shut the slide show begins..."" continuing on with the title track ""The Story,"" and concluding with the hidden track ""Hiding My Heart"" which begins with the line ""This is how the story went..."" The entire albumn is beautifully presented. Brandi's vocals start out strong and sweet and erupt into an explosion of gritty passion. The upbeat ""Have You Ever"" reminds me of my days as a camp counselor, and the melodious harmonies in ""Cannonball"" are soulful and numbing. Her self-titled Debut was good - but this one is fantastic!"
5,Brandi Carlile - The Story,"This is to be listed as one of my favorite CD's. Prior to purchasing this CD I did not know who Brandi Carlile was. I heard her song Turpentine on CNN-Live via my computer. I was so impressed just with that song that I purchased her CD the Story. Listening to all the tracks, I am impressed. How wonderful it is to have another singer song writer come along to join the ranks of Lucinda Williams, Emmylou Harris and Melissa Etheridge. I hope to see more of her music in years to come."
4,"I know she yodels, but...","I really like this album. I've been listening to it at work for a couple of weeks, now. I love the care-worn quality of Brandi Carlile's voice; that edge in her voice effectively portrays the emotion in these songs and, dare I say it, makes the little bit of yodeling likeable. I love T. Bone Burnett's production of these songs. I don't normally go for country (especially pop-country) and this album falls somewhere between rock-folk-blues-country - sort of like the [early] Eagles, Emmylou Harris, Bonnie Raitt, John Hiatt."
4,Country/folk easy jams,"If you want some easy listening tunes, this cd is for you. Of course, you also have to enjoy country and folk-style music, but I will say the twang and ""country-esque"" licks are understated in the album. The lyrics were also different; deep and thoughtful, there is a definite poetic flair to the words, in contrast with the usual ""my boyfriend cheated on me with my best friend's sister's cousin"" lyrics. A plus for getting you in the contemplative mood..."
3,"The Story, by Brandi Carlile","Unfortunately, the song I wanted wasn't reproduced on this album like I had been hearing it on the radio. Too bad."
4,Love it!,"I can't stop listening to this!! The first few tracks are unbelievable and the rest of the cd is pretty darn good too. In addition to the title track, favorite songs include: Turpentine and Wasted. Brandi's voice is beautiful, rich and true. Just one warning, if you're considering buying this disc, at times this music has a country-ish vibe to it...so if you're not down with that, this might not be for you."
5,Wonderful!,"I heard her cd on the radio...went right away and bought it. She reminds me of Pat Benetar. However, she has a unique Rock-Folk type way of singing."
5,Love this Pop-Rock-Country Mix!,"The first time I heard Brandi Carlisle sing on the radio, I pulled the car over so I could listen to the song. It absolutley captivated me. I was sure she had to be in her 40's. The grit and soul in her voice sounded like a woman who had REALLY lived. What a shock when I saw her video! I was blown away that someone her age could write and sing on that level. She is amazing! My whole family loves this album! Even my husband, who doesn't usually like country music, enjoys this album."
5,"An Excellent Start, Rising Fast","Brandi Carlile is an excellent musician with a sound all of her own. As young as she is, she has a long road ahead of her. Both my wife and I listen to her music and just watched her on DirecTV last night in the concert series. Brandi sings and performs like she has been doing so for years. I can't wait to hear more from her."
4,this album speaks to me,"I love listening to ""The Story"". Brandi's incredible voice coupled with her renditions of the tunes is fabulous. Her power and passion are undeniable. My friends have really liked it too."
5,A start of a bright music career!,I first heard Brandi Carlile when she came for a promotion to Amazon. It was a real knock out performance. I went back and ordered her full album. I've been hooked on to it ever since. Its one of the best albums I've bought in the recent past. This is a great start to what I expect to be a brilliant career.
5,great cheesy anthology,"I love this film. I remember seeing it several times as a teenager on Saturday afternoons. It's a horror anthology with a handful of stories I won't go into since that info is available on imdb or any number of sites. It doesn't have the highest production values or special effects but the film is a lot of fun. The DVD comes with some nice extras, namely the interesting interviews with Joel Reed, the production crew and actors.I will say the movie barely earns a PG rating, which I think is a good selling point considering Joel Reed's other cult horror film."
3,Skeleton belly ring.,The ring is too small for the belly piercing. One would not be able to wear this jewelery for a long time without piercing getting irritated.
2,Oona?,"This supposed biography of Oona O'Neill Chaplin spends much of its time discussing Eugene O'Neill and Charlie Chaplin. Certainly Oona lived in the shadow of Charlie, but she doesn't emerge as a person in this biography. The book is poorly written. Too much repetition of points made, some really silly sentences of superficial statement. And no depth. Nonetheless, it's an interesting read because of the people and the lives narrated."
4,Oona O'Neill - Enigma,"I have long been interested in this woman, first observed as a girlhood friend of Carol Marcus Matthau in her book. The name alone is intriguing, and the story behind is is just as fascinating. One feels a bit let down after reading this book to think of how abandoned she must have felt in her girlhood, and how saved she was to have found Charlie Chaplin. Never having developed herself as an individual, it was not surprising to read that her life virtually fell apart after her husband's death. The reality is that marriage to him was her life, and when he was finished, so was she. I got the impression she was happy enough to have it end that way, although it is sad all the same for the reader. A very interesting story."
1,Very Oily - Not Very Effective,"This tanning oil has the consistency of vegetable oil on your skin. Everything from bugs to cat hair will stick to you, and it gets on whatever clothing you might be wearing. It also doesn't seem to do much in accelerating the tanning process. There are much better products out there."
4,Good Tannning indoors or out,"I have very fair skin and very blonde hair - I've used this tanning oil for about a year now with excellent results - it works best in the sun, but because there is no sunscreen in it, it also works for me in tanning beds just BE CAREFUL it is intended for people that have pretty good tans already - Thanks for reading...J. Hunt"
5,Excellent tanning OIL! Smells wonderful! Affordable!,"I have used this stuff for years and it still is the best affordable tanning OIL in my opinion. (Yes I capitalized OIL because some of the reviewers on here apparently can't read the label and complained that this product is too ""oily""...duh, it's tanning ""oil"" people!) It smells so tropical and wonderful with a hint of coconut and other exotic fruits and flowers. It is the bests scent of any tanning oil I've ever tried and it works...really works! The best thing about Hawaiian Tropic dark tanning oil is that you can find it at just about anywhere...even Walmart! When my husband and I went to Cancun on our honeymoon, it was even there in the gift shop. So, I give this product 2 thumbs up and 5 stars!"
4,Delightful adventure,"This is a charming and funny first-person account of life on a boat in the Caribbean. Margie's sense of humor must have contributed to the long stay aboard their sea-going home. During their time at sea, Margie and Bob had many adventures and met many interesting (and strange) folks whom she shares with the reader. This account will make you laugh out loud."
5,The Real Deal,"This stuff is great. It extends the life of your strings, and it keeps the strings smooth and easy to play. I know that ""Real"" stringed instrument players change their strings every few hours, but I am both too frugal and too lazy to do this.This package is not to be confused with the Dr. Stringfellow SPRAY bottle, which is somewhat wasteful. This one has a felt applicator on the top with which you apply the liquid after playing.Well worth the money."
5,Bass Saver,This string cleaner is great for bass. I am a gigging bassist and have this product to do what it claims and more. I started using it as a lubricant prior to playing and found that it actually brings brightness and snap back to strings that have dulled a bit. The price is right so give it a try.
2,Does not thread very well,"This step up ring does NOT thread very well, it feels very tight(at least on my Canon 50mm 1.8, it may work better on a different lens). I think it just not machined very well. I got some Fotodiox step up rings as well as some macro coupling rings for some reverse lens work a couple of months after I bought this one and they work very well, very well made, and made in the USA."
1,Bad copy?,"Perhaps my situation was a fluke, but the product I received did not match the one shown in the product photo. it is not a ""Bower"" brand, and is terrible to use. It is easy to screw on, but I had to apply so much force in an attempt to get it off that it broke the focus ring (on a Nikon AI MF lens). If it will do this to a manual focus lens I highly doubt it would fare well with auto focus lenses. I WOULD NOT recommend buying this."
1,wrong order,"ok very simple, I ordered a 52mm-58mm and I received a 52mm-67mm. is this a joke? be careful with this one... now what because I dont need a 52mm-67mm..."
4,It does the job!,"I prefer to buy filters in large sizes for my large lenses, and step down for my small ones. This was one of the least expensive adapters I found, and it works perfectly well for what it is. Granted, it is tricky to get a polarizer screwed on to it and then the ring screwed on to the lens, but that is true of ANY adapter ring and not all of us can afford the Cokin P system. ;)"
2,Brought from A&R Photo Video Inc and recieved wrong product.,"I read that Adorama sent generic adapter rings instead of the Bower ones shown in the image and description, so I purchased the product from A&R Photo Video Inc and they ALSO sent a generic adapter ring instead of the Bower one. It is very unethical when a customer sees the description and picture of a product, trusts the store that they will send the one shown officialy, and the store sends a different one that the customer never chose to buy. There cannot be a distrust between customer and store, but in this case there is one, so I will never buy again from A&R Photo Video Inc."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"NOT a Bower; unfortunately a no-name converter- not the one shown in the picture with ""Bower"" on it. I took off one star because of the misrepresentation but also another one because it is not very smooth when attaching to my Hoya HMC UV filter. Still, it is metal, does its job and will probably last."
5,Bower Step-Up Adapter Ring 52mm Lens to 58mm Filter Size,Excellant product. It does what it was intended for and is of very good quality. Not much more you can say about an adapter ring.
4,Great,Worked great for making sure that my lens would fit my camera. Not much else to say other than its a metal ring.
5,Perfect gift for a John Deere fan,"This is to be a Father's Day gift for my stepfather, who loves history and anything John Deere. He already has lots of John Deere items, including a few ancient tractors. I thought he might enjoy reading the history and seeing photos of the really old machines. The book excerpts on Amazon don't really show much of what is in the book, but I took a chance and bought it. It is exactly what I hoped for: lots and lots of photos of old tractors and farms and farming machinery. I have no idea what some of that stuff is, but my stepfather was raised on a farm in Kansas and he will love it. I didn't read much of the text as I am not interested in tractors, etc., but it seems well written and informative. I'll be proud to give it to him."
5,Everything And More You Need For Your Drill!,"I've had this set about 2 years now and actually had forgotten I bought it online at Amazon. I use it often for things that are even bordering on ""creative"". Great basic set of accessories you'll use over and over. I have the Black and Decker Rechargeble 9.2 V drill and I use it at least once a week and love having available options."
4,This author carries on the tradition of her great books,"This was a lovely novel - great characters and wonderfully descriptive and detailed on the characters, events, and past history of foreign lands. I felt like I knew the people. Also very erotic. The only down-side was I felt something was left out. There was so much eluded to about the past that we never heard about. Felt like I was missing something. The book could have maybe been longer to tell us more. but over all I thoroughly enjoyed it."
1,too expensive to make,"I was very disappointed in this book, the items in it would cost to much to make, you are better off buying these touches at a hobby store or miniature show already made. Obechi wood, huh? Where does one find this? Almost every wood item needed this type of wood. Not very happy that I paid over $16 for it, the reviews made it sound like something that was worth having in my library of dollhouse reference books. I cannot see myself being able to use it because of the obscure materials and buying of them would run too much. The only positive is that the pictures are excellent. I am hoping that I can send it back."
4,Juliana Hatfield goes in a new direction,"Sittin' in a Tree...I am a major Hatfield fan. I have all of her stuff, including her work with the Blake Babies. This new cd ""Sitting in a Tree"" seems to be a bit country-fried, which I have not seen from her before. I know nothing about Frank Smith who is also credited on the album. I will research him. All I can really say is that this is a new direction for Juliana. I am such a fan of hers that I can say, ""Bad Juliana Hatfield is better than excellent most anyone else."" This is definitely worth a listen, for all of us who love that quirky baby-doll voice of hers."
1,Arrive damaged,"Purchased in June of 2012, construction delays caused delay in installation to December of 2012. Opened the box and found a broken lens/diffuser. Too late for Amazon return so I'm out of luck. Can't find any recourse on Amazon website. Steer clear of this one."
3,Double packed and still damaged,Amazon tried harder to get it right. It was well wrapped with bubble wrap and a second box over it. It still arrived damaged. The lens is cracked in the corner and the metal bent. I don't think this happened in shipping. The box has no signs of damage. I think it was done possibly prior to original packing. The piece that's broke isn't even in the box. Maybe these are seconds. I can use it and it looks like a nice light so I give it 3 stars.
1,Poor Packaging,"One star for the poor packaging. The lights arrived with the lenses broken and the ends bent. Amazon was great about returning them so I thought I would try again and get replacements. No luck, they arrived the same way so I got a refund."
2,"Never got it installed... Arrived damaged, twice.","I can't really rate the light fixture on how it works because I never got it installed. I ordered this light, and was anxious to get it installed in my garage. But as soon as it arrived it looked damaged due to in adequate packaging. And, it was... A cracked plastic lens/cover. It was real easy sending it back to Amazon and getting it replaced. However, the replacement had a bent and dented sheet metal housing. I didn't bother with another replacement... I just got a refund. I'm a mechanical engineer and have some experience with product packaging, and I don't think Lithonia intended this product to be shipped in the mail as Amazon does... It's simply not robust enough."
5,Great tool,"I gave my husband this tool I believe 2 years ago for a Christmas present and he uses it so much on a daily basis that he's worn through the carrying case and he wore out the tool. It didn't wear out because of poor quality but because he uses it for absolutely everything, work and personal projects alike. He can't live w/o it."
2,Avengers Vol.3 Review by toons times.,"I give it a low rating only because the episodes were not in the right order. And for the money I spent, and being factory, made I expect perfection."
5,Recall to Inferno-worth the read,the delivery was prompt and the book was in the condition promised. its a good read and i recommend it
5,Will save you a lot of time,"This book is really good at distilling the web services standards down to the core essentials - what are the most important things to know and more importantly, where the specifications still have room for improvement. So if you would prefer to save yourself a lot of time wading through specs in order to be able to hold your own in front of the whiteboard (or keyboard) there is no better book than this. What I like most about Eric's books is they are always written in a very honest and straightforward manner and they are obviously informed by years of real world experience - in other words basically the opposite of a David Linthicum book."
5,Love Alma's Design Sets,This year I have used many of Alma's design sets with books in my classroom. They have drawn some children into the world of books that were previously not showing much of an interest. I love it when children bring books to me and ask me to read them again and again during choice time - especially children that had previously not been too interested in books. These types of manipulatives have been good tools in my classroom. They are well made and will last through many years of teaching.
4,Cute,"This little set is small, but fun for the grandkids to play with at bedtime when the story book is read."
1,Not the version you want,"Alas, after waiting for almost five months for this CD, I found that this was not the version of Stand by Me by 4 the Cause that had been so popular on the radio. If ever there was an argument for Napster, this very poor version of what may have been an early demo tape is it. The seller of this CD is obviously ripping off the artists if this is the best production value they will put into this product. Regrettably, there was no lower mark than one star for this review guide -- so think of the star given as a dwarf star circled by cold dead planets."
5,Great phone,The big plus of this handset is that it runs off AA batteries making it much more economical in the long run. The handset in general has been great as well.
2,Where's the AC Adapter,"The item description clearly stated that an AC Adapter was included. I did not receive an AC Adapter and had to buy a universal at Radio Shack for $20.00.Regards,Mike Trips"
5,Satisfied Customer,"I installed the Powerdrive 70 V2 with 54"" shaft on my 20-foot open bow V8 powered Bayliner ski boat. With 70-pound thrust it easily moves the big heavy boat around with muscle to spare. At full throttle it even moves along plenty fast enough to troll. I installed a swivel bass boat seat up front and at low speed settings I can silently work the shoreline with complete comfort and control. I'm very happy with my Amazon purchase of this well designed, easy to operate, high quality MinnKota product."
5,Bravo!,"Six weeks of hell...six weeks of my life I will never get back..six weeks of taking a beating.My daughter Kayla is so undeciplined,she can rip apart a household in 10 seconds.This book helped me control her for the first time in her life.Some of the tips I used was putting jalepheno juice on all of our stuff so she would not get at them without paying.I also used the diagram in the back of the book to construct a cage to keep her in when visiting family or friends.I have aged 10 years since she was born.I wear my pants to my ribcage."
5,inside book says,"This book is an updated version of a seminal study, done at the Rand Corp, of the private police industry in the USA. It describes the structure and functioning of the industry, how it is regulated, its relationship to the law, and the problems it faces. The book also evaluates the benefits, costs, and risks to society of current private security practices and suggests statutory and policy guidelines for improving the performance of the industry."
4,A long needed companion for Elements of Style.,Mr. Fisher provides underrarm odorant for the spoken word
5,OCR OK!,"As opposed to the previous reviewer, I have found the product excellent in both pure OCR and tabular data. Maybe my standards are lower, having graduated from a definite One-Star product, Caere's OmniPage Limited Edition that came packaged with my Canon scanner."
1,Wrong item shipped!!! Very slow shipping!!!!,I thought this was the adapter that will connect my 50mm 1.8 II to the front of my 28-105mm just like the other reviewer described and the seller. Just a waste!
1,WARNING: NEWLY RECORDED LIVE VERSIONS!,This tracks here are from a live concert in 2004. If you are looking for a low cost introduction to the Pointers choose instead the Platinum & Gold Collection for the classic 80's material or 20th Century Masters: The Millennium Collection for the early years.
2,original music,"I was quite disappointed in this item. I am familiar with the I'm So Excited from the 1980's and had a cassette which has since been worn out. I bought the CD and perhaps I didn't read the fine print, but when I listened to it, I found that these were not the original songs as they were on the cassette. They are a live version and are not anything like the originals. Sorry I bought it. Never listen to it."
1,NOT a docking station - more a rarely functioning port replicator,"Shame on Kensington for advertising this as a docking station. It is a USB port replicator with wired networking and sound. As such it would be useful if it worked. The sound and network interfaces fail regularly requiring you to uninstall and reinstall the drivers (Dell Studio Laptop, Windows Vista).Don't waste your money on this product. You're better off getting a handful of zip ties to bundle up your cables and plug/unplug at will."
1,Disappointing,"I've been using this 'dock' for some time, and it is very disappointing. The sound and ethernet connections do not work reliably with my Vista system. Reinstalling drivers doesn't help much - it turns out it doesn't really have good support for Vista users. The Kensington website does have the Windows XP logo with the description of the SD100, but avoids spelling it out in the description anywhere, and most retailers, including Amazon do not spell out that it is really designed for XP. The support for this product from Kensington is almost non-existant on the website. I would save your money and get a port replicator to handle most of your peripherals."
2,Almost a good product,"I bought the SD100 ""docking station"" knowing I was getting a glorified hub. But it was exactly what I wanted with a new laptop, which replaced a full size pc that was on the floor. I needed this hub to provide an extra four USB ports and the connection points below my desktop, because having five peripheral cables running across my desk was awful.The hub required Dell tech support to get it to work with my speaker system - an arduous process, mostly due to the incompatibility of this hub with Windows 7 64bit. But once the speakers worked I was happy - for 10 weeks. Now the ethernet port no longer lights up so I have to connect the ethernet cable to the laptop - a 3rd cable across my desk. I'm resigned to using a C grade product because I still need the other connections, but I'd never recommend the SD100 to anyone who can use something else."
2,why wouldn't you make it charge,If this was a true docking station don't you think they would make it charge your laptop when it is plugged in. This is just a large USB plug port. Worthless as an actual docking station. NO CHARGE NO MONITOR OUTPUT!!!
2,not a docking station IMO,"I find this ""docking station"" pretty useless because it does not hook into an external monitor, a key peripheral when I use my laptop at home. A true docking station is all-inclusive; this one is an overpriced item saving someone with a bluetooth computer only from connecting to a printer and speakers."
2,Paid $15. Pretty much useless. Sound integration does not work with dock,"The only reason I purchased this was to get some wiring out of the way. While it does that well, you must note:1. The sound integration does not work. In order to get sound from the computer or external speakers, you must UNPLUG the dock and hook up to normal computer outputs. If you try to hook up sound to the dock directly it will fail all the time and cause you headache.2. When unplugging the dock, many times the sound from the computer will fail since it tries to send sound to the dock. When this happens, you must restart your computer to get sound working properly. Happens all the time.I also use it to keep my computer cool by using it as a stand. For this, I give it 2 stars since stands are usually $10-$15 anyways and it adds a couple extra USB ports.DO NOT SPEND MORE THAN $15 ON THIS"
1,Could not get it to work with Windows 7,Could not get it to work with Windows 7 at all. The specs here don't say anything about compatibility but Kensington says it is compatible on their website.
3,"OK, but not a Docking Station","Installed no problem on Vista Home Premium and a Win 7 Professional 64 bit system. NOT a true Docking Station.Just a port replicator: Provides multiple USB ports and if connected by wire to a Wired ethernet connection provides USB connectivity. (Why you would want to do this is beyond me, as connecting the ethernet cable to the laptop is just as easy.)"
3,Kids will enjoy this.,"I have never actually seen the Lizzie McGuire Show but I hear that kids love it so I checked out this book from the library. It was pretty unchallenging but sort of fun. I didn't really like the first story about the new kid but the second one was very funny. It reminded me of the episode of Saved By the Bell (BEST TV SHOW EVER!) in which the teens have to ""marry"" each other. Hilarious! Enjoy!"
5,Must have for Pulmonary Pathophysiology,"This book is very concise and covers all of the necessary information for a Pulmonary Disease course. Also worthy of mention is the fact that is is the top selling book in the field in it's category. I find it perfect for a Respiratory Therapist, Medical Student, or Physician's Assistant due to the easy to learn format and clear writing style of the author. Also, rumor has it that West is coming out with a combined Pathophysiology and Physiology for Pulmonary that should be well done as well."
4,italian reviw,"I think Rips describes italian people in a very real way...reading this book, my firsi impression was ""but what kind of idea do americans have of Italy and Italian people?"" but when i finished the book, walking in my town ,Collecchio,in Emilia(north of Italy) I realized how many Mezzadonnas, Vittore, Pasquale ecc.ecc. are living next to me! That's strange but that's nice...very nice...that's ITALY!!!"
1,No life!,I was very disappointed with this book. It has the feel of an attorney's fact sheet. I had four hours to kill on a train ride and still couldn't get into it. No life to it.
3,Morrison or Manson?,"If your looking for Manson to talk about the two nights of murder,you will be disapointed.Poetory sounds more like the Doors.Still it is interesting."
1,"Tasteless, tiresome, bad giberish.","There's really not much too this. I don't dismiss it as the rantings of an evil murderer. I dismiss it as the mindless rantings of a man who speaks in an endless stream of consciousness, with no real talent for music or poetry. His metaphysical and philosophical musings are nothing new at all, in fact they're quite tiresome. Its just a rehashing of a mess of meandering drivel.Don't waste your money on this. Go look for some interesting text books on philosophy, theology, or new age thinking. You'd probably get a pile of such tomes for the inflated price of this ""rare"" Compact Disc."
2,"Cave In's ""Pluto""","Brief little snapshot in the hardcore-turned melodic rock band's history. With only one real standout track (1) followed by the progressively uninspired and stereotypical different ""genre nods"" (2-5), the creativity found here does not eclipse much worth purchasing."
4,A Fun Read,"This first book in a projected multi-book saga introduces us to Helen Andros, a feisty and appealing military physician in a world ruled by malign reactionary theocrats and riven by racial distinctions -- a world vaguely reminiscent of the contemporary US of A. Lieutenant Andros goes through more trials, both literally and figuratively, than the perils of Pauline, and, while she doesn't always come out on top, she makes for good company, with an irrepressible, wise-cracking style that blends elements of heroines from film noir and screwball comedy. The writing is solid, and a glossary at the back of the book helps readers keep track of an extensive cast of characters which includes virtuous, conflicted heroes like Lord James and Lord Matthew and hissable villains like Prince Enoch. Despite the bleak world of Azgard conjured by the author, the book feels humanistic and warm, and its concluding vision (the vision of the title) whets reader interest in future installments."
3,"Good, but I just wanted the trailer song...","The song are cool, somewhere interesting.But the reason that I wanted this soundtrack, from the not too good movie FROM HELL, was the inspiring and really cool trailer song.That song was just great, I went to see the film 'cause of that song.But i never herad it in the movie, or in this CD.I know that this song was also used in STIGMATA's soundtrack.It's called `Reflect trees'.But I checked it out, and it's not here to listen.A real shame, the only great thing was not here.A specially liked the WhiteChapel murders and Marilyn Manson's n songs.Those were my favourites.The others are still good, suspense and chilling music, for a horror film.FINAL GRADE: C"
4,"If you want a song from the trailer, look elsewhere","To anyone saying that they bought this cd or went to go see this movie for the song ""Reflect (Time)/Tree Whispers"" by Billy Corgan: you deserve your disappointment. The trailer to a movie will have different music than the film itself for obvious reasons. To say that one would want to go see a movie based on that one song is preposterous.For the music itself, it is wonderful. It portrays the mood and feeling of the movie it represents. 4 out of 5 stars is not bad but there is a reason. The music is representative of it's source material and not entirely enjoyable unless one has seen the movie. In other words, it doesn't stand entirely on it's own two feet. But it is wonderful and definitely worth your money if you enjoyed the movie, it's mood and it's music."
5,Cute St. Pat's Day book for a 1-3 year old,"I'm always looking for St. Patrick's Day books for my toddler and three year old. My three year old has outgrown it, but still likes to look over my shoulder when I read it to my 18 month old. Great pictures."
2,War and Peace,"As a fan of Buth and his song contributions to the Flatlanders, I was disappointed to find many of the songs to be unsubtle, strident polemics against war or the obstacles to peace. The melodies were not memorable. It is in sharp contrast to Neil Youngs most recent release dealing with the same topic."
1,"Short, dull, and ugly","I bought a whole raft of cheap knives a while back just to see if there was anything usable for under $10. (I certainly didn't pay anything like $15 for this knife.) There was a surprising amount of wheat in there, but this thing is chaff. Dull enough but not quite heavy enough to use as a steel baton. Shown to an attacker, it could perhaps make him feel queasy.In the $10-$20 range, the big Marts have fixed blade knives by Outdoor Life, Ozark Trail (which are also sold under the Maxam brand, as well as Frost Cutlery), Gerber, and Schrade, all of which are highly functional and a pleasure to use despite the basement price. This, I can't find a use for. It's too hideous for a paperweight. Maybe I'll use it as a chisel if I ever have to demolish an old wood floor."
2,"Disappointed, needed a conclusion.","I didn't think there was that much new in this book, it was like I had heard it all before. I kept reading only because I was waiting for new material to surface and soon, reading became just turning pages. This book seemed to be a vehicle to vent the authors frustration with mainstream archaeologists, which they probably deserve, however the constant criticism of them didn't make a very pleasant read."
1,"no new info, an attack on the establishment","I have already read all the information contained in this book, somewhere else. All that is left is an attack on the credibility of the establishment, which is seemingly deserved, but constant criticism doesn't make a pleasant read. When I finished, still hungry for a conclusion, I threw this book in the trash."
1,Barely about aliens,"It isn't until the 3rd chapter which is 115 pages into the book that any hint of aliens is eve mentioned. And when they are, its brief and pretty much info restated from Chariots of the Gods. There's more talk of aliens on the back cover than throughout the book. Most of the book talks about Egypt history and about the pyramids, which is fine if you're interested in that stuff. but I'm not, I wanted to see all the new evidence of aliens like the cover says but it didn't happen.As for his credibility: I don't care. I wanted to merely be entertained by this and instead of was boring. There's one really interesting thing about the special powers that any pyrmid shape can have and the results of experiments used with these.If you wanna know about the pyramids shafts and Egypt history, then get this book. If you wanna know about aliens building the pyramids like this book says it will explain, don't get this book. What a waste of time and money."
1,Misleading Pseudoscience,"This book is completely misleading. I had to read it for a class on myths in Archaeology, where we discussed the factual basis for aliens in ancient Egypt and other claims. However, Von Daniken has no factual basis for this book. He twists the truth, misquotes other authors, leaves out pertinent evidence, and outright lies to his readers, all because he thinks that ancient extraterrestrials visited the earth. His ""research"" is solely based on what he wants to believe, not facts. Don't waste your money."
4,The Ivory Tower Scientist is Wrong Again!,"Eric von Daniken once again tries to expose the historians and archaeologists for their repeated dogamatic adherance to unsubstantiated and unscientific claims surrounding the Egyptian pyramids and their neighbor, the sphinx. Like the historians past that claimed that Columbus discovered America, Daniken shows conclusively that the Egyptian archaeologists have long had their heads in the desert sands."
4,Would love a signed copy,"I have known this author for about one month now and I keep hoping he will give me a signed copy of this cookbook but to date, no show! I have brought in many turkey sandwiches and shared them with him, I have made his coffee for at least 30 days and aqlmost any other little detail he has assigned but still, no book! Rex"
5,Holiday Eggnog With A Shot of Wry,"As he has in all of his remarkable albums, Darryl Purpose - one of the the most accomplished musical raconteurs in the business - takes us on 12 musical journeys that will leave you wishing this was a double CD.Darryl's ""Gift"" is one that will leave you moved, thoughtful, amused, and thoroughly entertained. The more you listen to his music, the more you appreciate this man's unique gifts. This is an album you will play over and over again - no matter what the season."
5,Funny,"Enjoyed this dvd a lot. It was very handy to be able to choose to view all the rooms with just the before and after. It was interesting to find that in the original of trade rooms, if they went over budget they did not have to run around trying to take some stuff back to meet the budget. Cuff's was my favorite designer due to his sense of humor. It was a real laugh to see what happened when two of the designers traded rooms themselves. Makes me wish I had the channel to watch Trading Rooms."
3,"It's just ""okay.""","It was entertaining and amusing to a point but hardly as delightful as full episodes. If you're a fan of the show chances are you'll be disappointed and if you're not, you're not likely to appreciate the show based on these clips, out takes and bloopers. Fortunately my version was a VCR tape and priced to sell."
4,Straightforward Singles Collection,"Though this set lacks a number of UK and Japanese singles, it's still packed with just about all their best-known tracks. The track progression is chronological, and the only original albums without representation are ""Shapes and Patterns"" and the recent ""Somewhere deep in the night."" I guess if you think of SOS as hitmakers or singles artists, this collection will certainly satisfy. If your interest in SOS extends to their lesser-known work, you're better off collecting the original recordings intact. For convenience sake, this CD is a handy sampler to take on trips, or when you're not able to bring along your entire SOS collection. Check out some of the other SOS compilations before you settle on this one...they all have their charms.J"
1,A deceptive title,"Pam Watts has chosen an inappropriate title for this book. In no way is this a beginner's guide to anything. One would have to be an expert sewer with an elaborate machine and many years of sewing and quilting experience to benefit from this book. There is no mention of hooping or stabilizing fabrics. These are techniques that beginner's need to know. Beginners do not use silks and satins and fancy ribbons for a project. I am very disappointed and I wish a more appropriate title had been chosen for the book. If you are experienced in machine embroidery and want to paint pictures with threads and fabric, this book is for you. But it is not a guide for a beginner."
2,No way is this a biginners guide,"I was looking for an introduction to Machine embroidery. I would not use this book or recommend it as a beginners guide. Nice techniques, once you have an idea of the basics"
1,curly,Not any of the 3 books that I purchased were really what they said they were for. One said it was for beginning embroiderying and it was not exactly embroidery. Hhad more of quilting.
4,Better hope the controller doesn't break,"Radio does sound good and is easy to use but my ""multi-control"" broke. This is the round silver knob on the front of the radio. It is made of cheap plastic but is not cheap to replace(35.00 dollars from pioneer). Also, it is a back order item and will take 4-6 weeks to come in. The radio does have a handy remote control that the kids can use on long trips. Have had the radio since 5-2008 and knob broke 11-2009 should have lasted longer, Pioneer said this happens often."
2,Cute but I had some issues,"This movie was okay for showing to children: no violence, sex, etc. However, it really wasn't funny enough nor did it have any kids (1, but not a lead role) to keep a child's attention. The wife lies to her husband repeatedly. This causes a lot of marriage strife. She easily walks out on him and he easily lets her walk out the door. Not a lot of commitment between them."
2,"not worth buying, just watch on hallmark","The thought and the message about the movie was good. However, I thought that there was something missing that most Hallmark movies have, it didn't move me as much as other Hallmark movies do. The storyline was sweet, but I thought the way things happened at the end was kind of wierd. all their time and money saved. I didn't get the point at the end, I guess. I don't want to give away the movie, but please don't waste your money and just watch it off the Hallmark channel. one word, disappointment. watch The Christmas Wish instead!"
1,So disappointed,I really wanted it to be good. I hate to give such a bad review. But the truth is my husband and I felt we wasted our money. It is not a feel good Christmas movie. We never got into the movie. It was a bad story line and a bad ending. Somewhat of an awkward movie. Maybe we just weren't the intended audience. We are in our late twenties and only watch wholesome movies. This was wholesome but lacking.
1,Cracking the GRE,"I purchased this book to use the CD exclusively - I had several other publications I used as study guides. So, my review is only of the GRE Diagnostic Software included on the CD. In comparision with the TestPrep software that ETS sells, this was far inferior. I was shocked after taking the test the first time to see how incredibly low my scores were. In fact, my score on the quantitative part of the Princeton Review software was 190 points lower than my score on that same section on the ETS TestPrep software. Fortunately for me, the ETS software was incredibly close to the scores I earned when I took the actual test. Perhaps my experience was unusual, however, I would not rely on the results from the software included in this package alone. Definitely make sure to purchase the GRE TestPrep software since it is exactly the same as what is used when the test is administered and based on my experience the scoring is much more accurate and reliable."
3,There are better guides available...,"If you are looking for a guide with strategies on how to take the test, as well as excellent practice software, this Princeton Review guide is adequate, though there are better guides available. Kaplan's guide is superior both in terms of strategy and software.... Also excellent is Jeff Kolby's Prep Course.... I agree with other reviewers that the Princeton Review guide's practice questions (both in book and software) are easier than the actual exam questions. This is particularly dangerous in potentially creating a false sense of security. My recommendation is that you pick up the Kaplan guide (which has excellent tuturial software) or Kolby's guide instead of this one. In any case you should definately take practice exams with ETS's POWERPREP software which should be sent to you when you register and is also available from ...(this website)"
1,What is that 'Windows' thing?,The most basic of tutorials. Big pictures of everyday use of a window's type operating system. Might as well apply to '95 or '98. If you've used either of these before you do not need this book.
1,One Bad Element can RUIN an entire Band.,"I was led here by some circuitous route online, looking for a band with Jerry Garcia-like trippy steel guitar (noone does it like he did I guess?).Anyways, I may be an overcritical SOB, but this band has a common defect....the music seems OK, but the SINGER is so farging teeny-bopper whiny and derivative in a downright Green Day bubblegum fashion that I cannot cope!sorry."
3,Decent,"It is a pretty decent soundtrack. Mark Isham did a good job. Most of the tracks are okay, but you will probably find Subway and The Heist enjoyable. It is worth the money, but it won't be your favorite soundtrack ever."
4,Zyxel g-1000,Great product. Installation instructions were confusing for the technically challenged like me. Definitely not plug-n-play!! Had to bring my system into work to get someone more knowledgeable than me to get it to work. But is working fine now.
3,Love the instrumentals,"Selections in recordings are fine, I love the guitar music. My first 8-track tape was this release. Cover not like picture, found copy of album, didn't need."
4,ahhh....old cave in,"my second favorite cave in record.""until your heart stops"" being the best.this record sounds alot like the one i just metioned but less developed and less singing parts.buy it now!"
1,Boring Emo,"Now I haven't heard a whole lot of hardcore/metalcore/mathcore or whatever label people put on Cave In, but as far as I know this the the most emo (whatever)core record ever made. Emo? Yeah, it's seriously emo. EMO EMO EMO. If you are an emo kid, you'll dig this. If you're not an emo kid and you like this, you're an emo kid. I mean, these guys have chops I guess, but this is emo at is most boring."
4,Perfect fit for my Sony HX9V,"After a long search, I found this case. This fits my Sony-HX9V camera perfectly. There is no room for anything except the camera. Probably, you can have your additional battery kept in the front portion of the case. Other than that, you cannot expect space for charger / audio-video / usb cables. But the camera fits in comfortably. The case is very compact, which you can just carry in your pant pocket."
3,Too tight for DSC-HX5v,"I can squeeze the camera in, lens side first, but the 'mode selector' dial is exposed. I can NOT squeeze an extra battery in the outside mesh pouch, certainly not with a case. I'd also be afraid to put memory cards in without their case as they'd be bent/broken over top of the camera.Great quality, just a little too small. But then again, the price was right!"
4,Nice,Hey for $5.00- it's a nice little case. Only problem- the fit for the RX100 is so tight there is no way to store a spare battery in this case.
5,Great Camera Carrying Case,I love the Sony Soft Carrying Case. Its great. It was delivered on time. Item was as described.
5,Nice Case for my Sony Digital Camera,"This case provides me with excellent protection for my new Sony Digital Camera. It is compact and easy to carry, yet it provides excellent protection for the camera."
1,"Recommended for Cybershot, but is too large for the camera, also feels abrasive.","Too large , too abrasive.I would have made it with softer material, and custom fit to camera. Who is their designer, a 3 year old?"
3,Does not fit DSC-WX150,"Ignore the reviews that say this works for a DSC-WX150. Camera is much smaller than this pouch, so ends up being bulky and camera can move around in bag."
4,Pretty good case for DSC-HX30V,"I'm not sure why Sony doesn't officially label this for this series camera. It's perfect for it. The only reason i gave it four stars instead of five is that you have to zip the camera in each time. The previous Sony case that i had the main camera pouch was a velcro enclosure for the camera (and a zipper enclosure for the extra battery and memory card) and this one is reversed. It's not quite as convenient to put the camera in and secure it with one hand as it was with the velcro main pocket.However, the case is still great for the camera. I love to have my camera case on my belt and this satisfies that perfectly. I was surprised how cheap an official Sony case was. Get it! I travel with an extra battery in it as well."
3,"Decent case, but not for all cameras","I bought this to protect a Sony Cyber-shot Digital Camera TX20, and it's a bit too spacious inside. I found this linked off Amazon's product page so I figured it would be okay. Looking at the dimensions, I knew it wouldn't be a perfect fit but for the price, it's hard to beat. If I had to do it again I'd probably get the Mini Sony TX20 J20 Canon IXUS50 IXUS60 Leather Camera Case."
4,"Great case for camera, little else.",I love the look and construction of this case. My issue is it doesn't fit the charger/cord if you're traveling.
4,Holds Camera Only,"This case looks great and is durable, but there is only one main compartment big enough for a point-and-shoot camera and one small pocket on the front that could hold one extra memory card OR one extra battery (probably not both). This case does not have enough room to hold any cables for connecting to a computer or TV, nor does it have enough room to carry extra hardware like a charging doc (most Sony point-and-shoots require a charging doc that plugs into the wall). This case will really only hold your point-and-shoot camera and an extra memory card or battery. If that's all you need to carry, then this is a good case."
5,Fantastic Case!!,"Pros: Easily accessible equipment, Lightweight, Well padded.Cons: NoneI use this product to hold and protect my Sony Cybershot W350 and it does do a fantastic job at that. The pocket in the front is very small and I believe is best used for an extra memory card in a little plastic case. This case is made out of a great material and gives great protection on the inside but is soft to the touch on the front, in addition it looks elegant. I actually have a bigger Sony cybershot case that has a shoulder strap that I put this case into. It fits perfectly inside the other case leaving no room to move around and it is safe to keep my camera extra protected. That other case comes with more room with two extra pockets for batteries and things like that. So all in all they work wonderfully together. Great Protection!"
5,Nice!,I bought this knowing this was just what I wanted. And it was! It fits the camera perfectly and attaches to your belt. It does NOT fit the battery charger. But you do not usually carry the charger with you anyway. It has a Extra pocket to put small stuff in. And for $5 it is a SUPER good buy and it is nicely made. Good quality.
4,"Good, Compact Case","I've had this case for a while and its a very well made, compact case for use. Tho it doesn't have much space for anything else apart from the camera itself, but its also quite compact and handy."
3,Not what I expected,"Based on the photos, a few reviews and the item description I expected this item to be more form-fitting for my new T99. Didn't realize until I wanted to return it the seller required buyers to pay for return shipments. With a product so inexpensive sending it back wasn't worth it so I decided to just eat the cost."
4,Camera case,"Love the case and the compartments for extra disks; however, the shipping cost of $7 was too much for the price and weight of the item. The Sony camera was almost $150 and there was no shipping cost. I should have both it locally and paid the sales tax on the case, which would have been much cheaper."
5,Awesome product,Best case for my sony tx55 camera. The front slot fits perfect for my memory card and the stylus. The inside is very huge and spacious for my slim tx55 camera. Worth the money spent.
3,Good case,"Pretty good for holding the camera, the memory card case and the USB cable. Only issue I have is that it could do well with a wrist-strap or another strap to hold it. I currently zip it up and leave the camera wrist strap out to carry it around."
3,Sony case,Good case maybe for travel but I used it for a day and then made my own case. This Sony case is far too bulky to carry around for everyday use.
5,Great Case,"bought this for my DSW-150 the fit is great the protection is also great, someone made an issue about it not having a shoulder strap, mine did not come with any as well, for me that was not in issue, for security reasons, i carry mine in a bag or in my pocket. the case in not that big, there is room for the camera, there is a small pocket in front for a memory card, i can also carry the card reader in the pocket. Again this is a great buy, it has its purpose, if you need a bigger case, this is not for you, if you want a case that will provide you with adequate protection without the bulk, there is none better as a choice."
1,Case too large,The case was supplied for a Sony DSC-HX5. However it is much too deep. The camera is shirt pocket size but once in the case it becomes really bulky. It bounces around in the case and you can almost fit another camera in with it. I will need to look for a new case. As I am overseas it is not worth returning it and will write this off as a bad purchase. They should not recommend a generic sony case which is too big for the camera.
5,roomy,"This case has room for all the extras needed to be carried, but is still small enough for a bag"
3,Too big for camera,It works ok for this little camera. It's not a big deal to me that it is really a bit large.
4,"A great little pouch, just wish it had more storage pockets","I got this mainly because of the belt-strap on the back. It's made of a nylon-polyester type strap which is very strong. Previous camera cases just never lasted as their straps always got ripped off when I got the pack snagged on objects I walked past. This case was different and I still have yet to see it wear out after much pulling and snagging. Bravo to the designers.My only gripe with this case is, however, that there are few pockets for accessories, like the Manfrotto camera stand, or the extra battery, or even a Gary Fong flash diffuser. I wish there were more.Still, it's a good solid case and I recommend it to those with few accessories for their point-n-shoot."
3,Mild Quality product,"Moderate quality item, it also fits dsc hx9v. It has a pocket for substitutional battery, i suggest this item for compact still cameras"
2,Disappointing Carrying Case,"This carrying case does not satisfy my needs. There is no shoulder strap; there is the belt snap, but that certainly shouldn't be the sole option. This is a most disappointing way forward in carrying case design. The case fits the Sony Cybershot 10.2 Megapixels DSC HX5 exactly with no room for the associated cable. The camera is slimmer than the earlier equivalent Sony, but the cabling has grown. Go figure!"
2,Too big for Sony Cybershot Tx10,This carrying case is too big for the Sony cybershot TX10 model. The camera is small and slick and the camera bag completely kills the size factor. It will probably work better for other larger models
2,i never got this shipped to my upto now,I never got it shipped to my place. I raised my concern but i had to go to the respective carrier and comcern and still i dint get it. So i left following up for the items.
3,"Arrived my item, but too, too late!!","My product arrived, in perfect form and how i'd want. But the problem was, in the time for delivered my item. Just after a mont i could have in my hands my item. For the rest, all good."
5,Another Excellent Backyardagains,"I have many Backyardigans videos. My grandson likes this one just as much as the others. Surf's Up has Pablo looking for Tiki Beach and the perfect wave. It's the best on this DVD, but the others are excellent also."
5,surfs up,"My son loves all his 'backyards' dvds, but this one is my favorite. The only drawback is that the songs do get stuck in your head and sta there."
5,My kids (and I) LOVE this DVD!,The Backyardigans are a huge hit in my home. Both my daughters LOVE them and this DVD happens to be one of their favorites. Especially the last episode. They could watch it over and over and over. A great buy.
5,I just love it!,"A belly chain (or waistlet) comes into its own when your clothing drops to a minimum. When wearing a bikini, a belly chain draws the eye to your middle and accentuates the flaring of your hips. Don't wear a bikini without one. But, when in the bedroom, jewelry becomes a must, with a belly chain being the very center of your ensemble, so get make sure you get an eye-catching one like this one!I highly recommend this belly chain. Its shiny silver and attractive understatement makes it a great addition to any ensemble. I just love it!(Review of Sterling Silver 30"" Inch Waist BELLY CHAIN Box Necklace)"
2,a seamless album,"I managed to buy this Cd on it's first day of UK release and how pleased I am. It's a great record-in my opinion his most consistent since American in Me. Each track seems to segue beautifully into the next and some of the songs are absolute classics-Rosemarie,Late Winter Song just two of many.If you buy Evergreen Boy I'm sure you will not be disappointed!"
4,Nice summary and great maps,"This review refers to ""THE D-DAY ATLAS"" by JOHN MAN. There is a small introduction that includes: Dunkirk evacuation, Operation Sea Lion, the Nazaire Raid, Operation Jubilee. The rest of the book is confined to the Normandy invasion of June 1944 up to the liberation of Paris. The Falaise Pocket is the last battle shown. There are 62 color maps.The maps are in color and have great eye appeal. Each map contains lots of info and will be easy to understand. The maps are great but with only a brief summary, I felt five stars would be too much.There is also an organizational chart of both the Allied and German armies in the west. A Chronology, and Code Name list follows. There are also a number of good photos scattered throughout the book.The author packs a lot in this 7 in by 10 in, 143 page book. If you're looking for a quality atlas of France and a concise summary for the first two months on the continent then you should consider this book."
2,Slap together book with little wisdom,"Am really disappointed in the book for a variety of reasons. One, 95% of the people listed aren't well known, or have such little to say that I got the feeling this was a slap together book that was produced simply to produce monies for his cardiac foundation. So disappointed I am sending it back to Amazon.com.The few bits of wisdom one can glean from the people in the book, is work hard, don't give up, don't lie and be nice to people on the way up because you may need them on the way down.Am sitting here trying to figure out who the target audience for this book is? Sure cannot be the under fifty crowd since there are so few people aside from Bill Gates, Joe Perry of Aerosmith for boomers to read. Where are the Tom Hanks, Steve Jobs, the young men who founded Yahoo and Google? Oprah, Jon Stewart, Ron Howard, Mel Gibson? Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Steve Young?Condi Rice, Tony Blair, etc?"
3,Light Father's Day Material,"Over 120 successful and well-known personages were asked to relay their favorite memories of their dads for this book. Larry King's was ""Don't lie,"" Alan Dershowitz's was ""fight up, not down"" (don't pick on people smaller than you), Randy Johnson's was ""Do the best you can - you might not get a second chance,"" and Dr. Koop's was learning the difference between being able to ""buy"" vs. ""afford"" something.Yes, there are some tidbits here and there, but it is hard to convey much in a page or less (in most instances). In any case, it is nice Father's Day material, and the proceeds go to one of Larry King's foundations for helping others."
2,Mediocre,"""Redesigning Humans"" is an attempt to deal with the growing debate about whether or not science and genetic manipulation should be used to try to ""improve"" on our species. As several other reviewers pointed out, this book can be summarized as ""Genetic manipulation of the human race will happen, it's a good thing, we'll all be better off, and although there are moral considerations, we won't bother mentioning any of them here"". The book is essentially this arguement, repeated over and over. There is very little concerning the science behind genetic manipulation and absolutely nothing on the ethics of undertaking the redesigning our species. This book could easily be compressed into a three page article without significant loss of content. As one who has spent the last twelve years in medical research (including gene therapy), I found the book to contain almost no science, nothing pertaining to the ethics of what is propossed, and to really have almost no content. I do not recommend it."
2,An Extremely Basic Overview,"This book claims to be a basic simple overview of Judaism and that is in fact what it is. Unfortunately it is little more. If you know absolutely nothing about Judaism than this is a good book to read and will give you a basic introduction. However, if you are even remotely familiar with Judaism you will find this book lacking in new material and didactic in tone."
5,Eating Cheap in Japan,This is a great book for travelers to the Far East. If you are there for the first or fifth time this book will help guide in the various dishes that are offered. It has pictures and brief discriptions ....it is pocket/back pack size and I felt truly valuable!!
1,Item color not as pictured,"The actual item is brighter in color and much more emerald green...I expected turquoise green with sage tones. This doorbell in actuality is much more ""cartoon"" looking than the aged verdi-green look I'd hoped for."
3,okay,"Don't be fooled by it's uncut title. The only thing they leave in is the blood. The dialect is still aimed at three year olds and the music sounds like something off of a nintendo game. The voice acting is horrible in some spots. The only good thing I can say about this video is the blood, still they charge more for blood."
2,FUNimation's Done It Again,"With a history of let downs over the last 2 years, FUNimation has brought and made us suffer through the onslaught of English Dragon Ball. But the slight gleam of light coming from Season 3 was put out. In Ginyu Double Cross Along with Ginyu's Assult, where FUNimation did better with no editting. We are stuck with bad voices and terrible background music. I suggest that only buy these is you have extra money laying on the ground that could possibly burn, spend that on these."
1,"Horrible sound, excellent animation... how sad.","I was thrilled when I bought an actual uncut version of DBZ. Even though many people complain that the Japanese version is better, I seem to enjoy the American version. Everything was great until someone opened their mouth. Their voices were terrible! Totally unremimnicent of the (american) characters we know and adore. The music was awful also, it sounded like it was recorded on a ""Casio"" keyboard. The sound alone was enough to make me lose interest. I mean with all the money ""Funimation"" makes off DBZ they could at least give us a quality video with original voices."
1,uhhh.....no,"It looks like funimation has screwed us over again. All of you true DBZ fans should boycot this crap until they give us a subtitled version with all the original music, voice actors and violence. Call me crazy, but I think that we deserve better than this."
4,Am I hearing wrong??? I wish I was...,"I've waited months to see these episodes, and now find that none of them sound the same. Vegeta, he sounds horrible now, where as he used to have a voice to had all of the personality that he deserved. Someone tell the people who cut these to RE DO THEM!!!!!! Get the right voices! Also, editing is way off. In the whole series, they've taken out the best scenes, thinking that they were too much for us. They're not!!! Ok, now I'm going to watch the old ones and wait till they get it right..."
4,Excellent video,"It is a great video, glad they kept all of the original people doing the voices... Too bad that after, what?, 1 or 2 years they couldn't EXACTLY do the same voices, they changed. But they're ok after you hear them for awhile. Rock on DBZ! (and I wish they'd hurry up and get to the android series, I'm tired of Frieza/Friezer)"
4,"Great, but could've been better.","I love Dragonball, and up until now, I have rated ALL the videos at 5 stars. The new episodes just released I give all 4 stars, because of the bad decision to recruit different voice actors. POOR Vegitta !!! He is my FAVORITE character, and his voice in the older episodes rocked! Now, his voice is mediocre and could've been a whole lot better. A person who just now began to watch Dragonball Z would rate the new episodes at 5 stars, but to veterans of the series, I believe 4 is justified. Overall this video is a GREAT , and if you don't buy it, you're missing out on the best anime ever created!!!"
5,BEST MOVIE EVER,"If you love dragon ball z and you love to watch the fighting sceens then this is the movie for you I mean, hey common who cares about voices and besides they are close enough to sound cool any way watch for them in september on cartoon network. they are going to air the next 50 episodes."
3,i liked it but they could of made it better,its a good video i liked it but just one thing vegittas voic
5,"Double Cross, Double Value","I thought DBZ was good in edited format, but now when they are also avaliable unedited they totally ROCK! Watching the unedited episodes gives a totally different feel to the series. The only thing I can remark on is the changed voices, but you get used to that after 1-2 episodes. All unedited episodes are a MUST for a DBZ-fan! If you get the edited version you will regret it if you ever watch the unedited one."
2,crapy,"Im sorry this was a movie not worth buying. I mean come on they used different voices, and cut almost every thing out ecsept a little blood. Unless you realy like DBZ I dont recemend it."
3,"Great, but lacks the flashyness of most DVDs","The Japanese version of DBZ is infinatly better than the English, so I would reccomend buying this instead of a VHS. The whole thing is kind of plain (no previews, boring menu, and only 2 chapters per episode) so only get it if you really like the Ginyu Saga or if you're trying to make a complete DBZ collection."
4,Goetic Evocation,the book is pretty neat as if gives useful information anyone out ther who has tried evocatin spirits please send me mail at cdrams_c@hotmail.com
3,Flashy and informative,"It's true the rituals of this book were interesting and the information provided was very helpful.But for anybody to think that it's possible to become invincible by summoning a spirit is an insult to the balances of the universe.Nobody can escape the fact that we all must leave this world,even moses,the one that could escape bullet shots without a single wound left this world."
5,Scary,"I had to get rid of this book, it brought an evil presence that broke up my home.Please be careful with this book."
2,The book says all spirituality is imagined!!,"The book states that all spirtuality is imagined, and anyone who believes otherwise is a fool. This is very Atheist and offensive. I may have been better off buying another book."
3,Maybe Its Just Me,"Along with the Greater Key of Solomon, both supposedly written by the biblical King Solomon, this represents one of the first storehouses of occult lore available for the serious student. Translated by renowned scholar S.L. MacGregor Mathers, the Lesser Key of Solomon the King has a good series of spells and rituals for use in invocation and practical magic(k). The problem with the book, though, is its long, difficult and obtuse writing style. Like I said in my review of the Greater Key, maybe I'm being arrogant when I say that King Solomon just couldn't write it well. Then again, you have to remember this isn't a story, its a Grimoire. It is meant to be perused as a ritual text by those who already have knowledge of Qabalah and the occult."
4,A good book for anyone interested in solomonic magic,"Overall the book was ok,the illustrations of the demons were especially good,but it did not give info about the robes,sword etc.etc. For anyone who really liked this book I recommend Goetic Evocation:The Magicians Workbook Vol.2"
2,Doesn't Work for Me,"I have been using it for 4 months, and I don't think this ""Neti pot"" thing works. I end up finding the right medicine (Zyrtech) that helps me a lot.I am still using my Neti pot whenever I come back from an extended period in outdoor and right after bed time. The idea of cleaning up stuffs from my noses is still appealing. But I doubt this thing really works.The only thing that I can recommend this Neti pot thing is that I can use it to clean up hardened stuffs from my noses easily using Neti pot. Water running though the hardened stuffs can quickly soften them and wash them away. It is definitely better than using any other mean to clean those stuffs.Jay Chan"
1,Missing scoop,"I love the neti pot and bought this item to store my salt in the bathroom. I paid extra thinking I was getting a container and a scoop. However I only received the jar of salt NO SCOOP. Order was placed through Amazon Prime, other vendors may provide the scoop."
5,perfect,"We have used these (I have ordered 4 for each family member) and it has helped keep our sinus's clear. I am trying to cut down my dependency on sinus medication and this has really helped. I find using this in the morning is better than using it at night. Nighttime use seems to stop my ears up a little, but my husband likes to use it at night. To each his own."
4,a good product,This is a nice product. The salt if very fine and pure and there is no burning like you get with the iodized salt. I did notice quite a difference in price so check around.
3,Works fine,"I expected this salt to dissolve more easily than other store-bought brands, but it doesn't really. However, it does what it's supposed to, so I guess it's fine."
1,Bad service,I will not do business with Direct Super Center again. They sent me the wrong item and refused to correct their mistake without in-proportionate costs to myself.
4,"Good product, but shipping was late.","I like the product, it comes with it's own measuring spoon which is a plus. It did NOT come within the time frame stated, it took two extra days over the two weeks stated."
1,"Save your money, make your own","I would suggest that you buy sea salt, and mix it 2 parts salt to 1 part baking soda. Sinuclense uses both ingredients an costs a fraction of what this does. Use sea salt, kosher salt, or even pickling salt, you want to make sure the salt you are using is pure. Don't overpay for convience."
2,Received a different salt - regular non-iodized sea salt,"Instead of receiving the Neti Pot Salt Jar as pictured, I got a shaker of ""Real Salt"" brand fine salt for food. The sticker label stuck over the jar says Himalayan Institute Salt, which it obviously isn't. It's still non-iodized salt and should work fine for Neti pot rinses, however I can't help but feel as if this was some sort of joke. I may as well have gone to the local supermarket and bought the exact same salt shaker rather than buy it online.TLDR: Didn't receive pictured item - sea salt rather than Neti Pot salt."
4,Very nice salt.,"A bit pricey, but I think it's well worth it. Contrary to what other reviewers have said, buying regular non-iodized table salt does not work for everyone. It causes painful bumps to form in and outside the nose. So I'll pay more for salt like this to be comfortable. Another great alternative is the Neil Med brand which also contains baking soda."
1,Flat Sound,"We were very disappointed in the quality of the sound of this CD There was nothing in any of the discriptions on line to indicate that it was copied from analog tape and may contain some anomalies. This was LOW -Grade quality. It sounded like playing it on an old ""45"" record player!!!We like Mama Cass and have CD's of the Mama's & Papa's which are great sounding.I think you need to put more discription in regards to the recording so the customer knows what they are buying."
3,LOST brought her back into the spotlight,"After her song ""Make Your Own Kind of Music"" was featured on the second season of LOST I couldn't get it out of my head. VERY talented woman. I'm only 25 but I already knew her from her dominant presence in Mamas and Papas but she continues to amaze me..."
3,Overall Quality,"I bought this because I wanted ""It's getting better."" I had it years a go on a 45, if anyone remembers what that means, or they were, and was dissappointed at the lack of base and depth of the sound on the CD that I had on the 45. That cut was used as the beginning background music a movie, the name of which escapes me, while the title and production data was being displayed and the base on that disk came across much better than that on this CD. She had a beautiful voice and that, at least, came clearly through."
2,I love Mamma Cass but....,"This CD sounds like it was made in a tunnel, but guys this may be the best we can get."
2,Updated material would be nice.,"This book does give a fairly good overview of the Omnimark programming(scripting) language, but the material is -way- out of date. Many of the examples given will not work correctly if at all with the newer versions of the Omnimark C/VM. Since the publish date of the book in 1997 there have been 2 major revisions to Omnimark (current version is now 5.2), and with these revisions many things have been added, deleted, or modified for one reason or the other. I do -NOT- recommend this book for those wanting to learn how to use Omnimark effectivly. I do however encourage the author to -UPDATE- this publication or discontinue it. Let us hope that the soon to be released ""part 2"" of this work is up-to-date and well structured."
1,Keep those pennies,"The information presented in this book is poorly organized, outdated, and incomplete. Sadly, it's the only book dedicated to OmniMark. The best way to learn OmniMark is to go to Canada and learn from OmniMark Technologies. This book covers OmniMark version 3. OmniMark version 5.1 is out now (July 1999)."
3,Some good info,"I've been working with Checkpoint Firewall-1 for 5 years now, so I picked up this book as a review when I was told to get my CCSA and CCSE by my employer. I have not taken the exam yet, so I don't know how well it prepares one for the exam, but I do know that I consider my knowledge of FW-1 to be deeper than most, yet I still learned some new tricks from this book.That was the high point. I thought the information was arranged in a confusing manner and that the questions at the end of the chapter were very poorly worded and caused a lot of confusion. Also, get used to the phrase ""it's important to understand"". It is used in practically every paragraph. After awhile, it began to bug me. Is this sentance important to understand, while the rest of the reading isn't? If I pay $40 for a book, it better all be important for me to understand. It's a stupid cliche, and it's redundancy got very tedious."
4,rotary math,"I also got this book for a class in basic rotary cutting. For the price it's wonderful. She tells you the math formula you need and the layout is realy great. A name, photo, formula, hints for cutting, etc. all on one page for each shape. And the star patterns in the back are beautiful. I wish she included some of the shortcuts though, like sewing 2 squares together, drawing a line on the diagonal and sewing 1/4 inch from line on both sides then cutting to make 2 half trianges...it would make the book so much more useful. I paid $$$ just for a pamphlet on what size to cut for what finished size...this one tells you the formula and includes some projects as well. I give it a 4 for content and value. Beginners would gain the most from it."
4,Great!!!,"Now I have less laundry to do with this bib!I LOVE it!!! It is made not of plastic, but of cloth which is sometimes used in bathrooms. So if there is a mess you can wipe it and use it again!The only reason why I gave 4* is because you can't wash it together with other clothes. As it will color everything!"
2,"Thought it was for toddlers, didn't read fine print","I had searched ""toddler bibs"". This ad came up, toddler pictured on the ads. But read the fine print.....it's INFANT size. I'm sure the next grandbaby can use it, but I needed to cover a 16 month old.!!"
3,Can not use it,"This sounds ridiculous, but I can not use it becuase my baby gets too interested in the little dogs on the red background and looks at them and tries to eat them instead of his food."
2,,"This distributor cap will fit my car, but the plug wires did not fit correctly. I made it work, but it was not correct."
4,Surprisingly good. Would like more DVD extras.,A surprisingly well acted and directed film. I liked watching it for the theatrical value although I bought it for the educational value.-It would have been good if there was some additional information about the production of the film or associated research.
2,plastic seat sharp edges on inside rim,"This plastic seat has 5 sharp points on the inside of the rim where the cutout for the seat opening was made. It is apparently from where the plastic over the opening was removed. I had to take a nail file and smooth them over to prevent scratches to myself when sitting on the seat. This is a poor quality item due to that. It shows the company worker did not test the inside rim by running his finger over it to ensure that it was smooth. This product was made in Canada, and I have seen better workmanship from China. I give it two stars good because it did actually fit the industrial pail as it said it did."
5,A loo go seat a must have,A great addition to my emergency kit or when camping. A must have. better then sitting on just a bucket. Sets up nicely. Haven't used it just yet but been there done that out on the shore fshing and no place to go.
4,dry camping,May not feel the sturdiest but does get the job done. much better than getting a shovel and looking for a place to dig.
3,does what it's supposed to,my girlfriend insisted that i get one of these so she can go the bathroom on the boat when we go fishing and camping. i prefer to do things the old fashion way but understand that there are plenty of people that aren't comfortable with answering natures call the natural way. fit on the first bucket i tried. not super high quality but it's cheap and fit the bucket and is good for doing the do.
5,Absolute MUST Read!,"Whether you're looking to buy your next home, get out of simple credit card debt, or want to tremendously increase your capacity to borrow (even if you're a startup business), Donna Fox's book is an absolute MUST read!No one over the age of 18 should NOT be without this knowledge.Donna has managed to take a vastly complex subject, and craft this in a simplistic manner so that ANYONE with a Grade 8 Education could follow along....IF you want to save yourself THOUSANDS of $'s per year, then this is a MUST buy!"
1,DISAPPOINTED,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AS I DID. THIS BOOK WAS MISLEADING; IT DID NOT GIVE ANY NEW INFORMATION ON HOW TO GET FROM CREDIT REPAIR TO CREDIT MILLIONAIRE. SHE SIMPLY TOOK PAGES FROM PRACTICAL INFORMATION MOST PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF. IF YOU ARE SMARTER THAN A 4TH GRADER DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.
4,good,"this is a short but good album. I give it 4 stars, just because to me it isn't as good as Vent or GOODBYE (which i tell everyone to buy). Not quite 5 stars, but very good."
1,Ugh!,"One thing for sure, this album is an ""acquired taste"". Geez I love Philip Glass. I have 15 of his CDs, and this is truly his worst. When I say this is an acquired taste, let me tell you it won't be a taste in your lifetime. Long, plodding, I doubt this would sound very appealing even while lounging in an MRI tube.I did my level best but YIKES this is terrible. Buy the Qatsi series, and definetly Glassworks. And Amazons de Aqua 'fantastic"". Now those are choices I can live with. Skip the acquired taste.Sa"
4,A great find!,"I read the first book in this series, Pretty Peggy-O and read this one right after. This book still seemed to have the author finding her way as a writer, but it was better than the first. And that's not to say I didn't like the first, I did. I liked this one better, but I think it still earns a 4. I am on to the next books in the series and I'm really excited, I think McCrumb has great potential as a writer. She creates stories and characters that you just seem to become wrapped up in. This is definitely a good susepense story."
4,McCrumb Does It Again,Sharyn McCrumb has a unique talent for displaying the beauty and melancholy behind the Celtic heritage of the Appalachian areas. This novel combines that with suspense. She does a wonderful job of making each of the smaller storylines within just as compelling as the main story.
2,The Antidote,"I can only say this book is the antidote to all the books written about small southern towns, such as the Father Tim books and Big Stone Gap, where there are delightful, quirky characters populating the book and tampering in each others lives. On the contrary, no one really pays any attention to anyone except theirselves. When it comes to the Underhill children, it is unbelieveable that the minister's wife, the sherriff, and even their lawyer would constantly mean to drop in, but never do it! What a sorry excuse Laura Bruce is for a minister's wife and a human being! Also, leaving a dead fetus in a woman's body until it decides to be born is just ridiculous. In reality they would have induced labor to get rid of it. I was totally glad to be done with this book and don't plan to read another Sharyn McCrumb."
3,Odd,"I found ""The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter"" to have too many subplots. I think Sharyn could have been more detailed if she had limited her focus to 1-2 storylines. I never understood her point in having Laura Bruce be the Underhill children's guardian when she never visited them. The same with the frequent reference to the sheriff visiting the children but never did. I have read ""The Ballad of Frankie Silver"" and ""She Walks These Hills"" and they were wonderful. I was a little disappointed with this book."
2,NOT A MYSTERY!!!!!!,"I really don't see how this can be called a mystery. It started off well enough but then went down hill the rest of the way. The book was fair but not what advertized to be. Please read the above statments by the publisher to see what book is about. If you want a book that will leave you sad, depressed and need a good cry, then this is the book for you. If you want a good mystery, then go somewhere else."
2,not her best,"McCrumb has a tendency to toss in one completely unrealistic plot device to keep her stories moving in the way she wants them to go. In The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter, it's the ridiculously non-existant guardianship of the Underhill teens. Can you say, ""Ward of the state?""Also, what was with the whole thing about the Judds? Particularly since all the facts were wrong. McCrumb has Martha tell Spencer that the liver is the one organ that doesn't get better, when reality is exactly the opposite. The liver is the ONLY regenerative organ in the body. Also, what's with the talk of the hepatitis coming from bad road food? If you don't want to go into the modes of transmission of hepatitis C, don't make it a subplot. As someone with a family member with hep C, the misinformation here really annoyed me. It's horribly nitpicky to say it affected my enjoyment of the rest of the book, but I kept thinking, what other facts has she gotten completely wrong? not her best effort at all."
2,Be accurate in your condition,"""Very good"" condition does NOT mean a broken spine and pages coming loose.I realize used books will have some wear and tear, but pages about to fall out doesn't come anywhere close to ""very good"""
4,Eerily Compelling!,"This book is quite different from most mysteries in that the perpetrator of the crime is known right from the beginning. But what the book is about is about a family in trouble, and we watch the steady decline throughout the book. All of the major occurences (and believe me there are a lot of them) are connected with an old lady soothsayer's visions. There is plenty of suspense throughout the whole book, and it led me on and kept me engrossed until the catastrophic ending. Ms. McCrumb is a formidable author, and this book (the second in her Appalachian series) is complex, absorbing and quite magical."
4,A good novel but not really a mystery.,"I really enjoyed this book. It had great story lines and fantastic characters. The emotions were well perceived you often felt the same raw emotion that so many of these people felt. But, it was not a mystrey novel. There was no whodunnit or suspense involved. I don't believe that this book should be classified as a mystery book. But, read it anyway for a good story but not a mystery story!"
4,Classy Look For Your Cabinet's,"PE's Black Ash will give your speaker project a classy looking finish. It does seem to have a pecularity that PE's other vinyl laminates don't have! If using light heat(hair dryer) to soften vinyl for bending over the edges of your cabinet, it has a tendency to bubble(many places). So ...my recomendation here is not to use heat to aid in sharper looking corner/edges!Make sure your MDF surface is well sealed, especially the edge grain with diluted wood glue/ Minwax Seal&Sand; or Poly! Several coats required with fine sanding inbetween. Make sure surface is wiped down before application. A extra helping hand will make things go alot smoother as well. These vinyl's can also be used for furniture applications as well, but do not recommend for irregular surfaces!"
4,In Defense of the Little Man,"This is an excellent work on the labor theory of value and its implications for social, economic and polictical policy. Contrary to what properly belived, this Baran's work is not in defense of Stalin, but rather the worker in a capitalist's society."
5,Dialetics and Creativity,"One of the major facts of the last 40 years, in terms of the history of thought, has been the fight of liberals and conservatives against marxism and dialetics. It has been an ideological struggle, a great effort directed to eliminating any and all contributions of marxists from schools, universities and social movements. This Longer View of Paul Baran, undoubtedly, is a master piece of, at the same time, sociological imagination and critical approach to many of the themes that, yet back in the 60's and nowadays are of great relevance to understand much of the social and economic process under monopoly capitalism."
5,Great CD.,Commemoration is in my opinion Charles Manson's best CD ever recorded. The sound quality is great and the songs are beautiful. There are less rants on this CD but the spoken poetry on Monologue is fun and not too serious. For any fan of Charles Manson's music this CD is a must have - it takes the cake.
5,Give it a try,"Anything with Charles Manson on the title is going to be dismissed immediately, due to the fact that it's Manson the horrible cult leader murderer monster making the music. But, if you're one of the few who can look beyond a person, and actually look at the music instead, what you'll find is a suprisingly emotional, simple yet beautiful album. There are very personal songs on this album, some with lyrics so touching, I've seen people, and I myself, have been driven to tears listening.If you're the type of person who will look at anything related to a ""bad person"" with blind, rabid hate...this album isn't for you. However, If you're the type of person who will give anything a chance...give Commemoration a try. You won't be sorry."
3,let's get the facts,Let's get your Manson facts straight before posting a review condoning murder of anyone. The words Helter Skelter were not written in Sharon Tate's blood - that was not even written at the Tate scene it was at the LaBianca's home. I don't even have any comment on this product but the review saying that it is cool to kill a famous directors wife warrented a comment. It is because of people like this that Charles Manson is wrongfully thought of and wrongfully glorified and hated at the same time.
3,ehh,"I thought the writing was mediocre and at times horrible. a reviewer before said it best, ""the door to clay's room was closed shut, like clay's personality"". I personally couldn't get into it, and so everything just seemed so poorly written. It was like ""what was he thinking while writing this"". In all seriousness, the haikus? so lame... I gave it some props because i liked where the author was trying to go. I also gave him 3 stars because of his efforts, but really they were overdone. I was disgusted at the writing. I liked the ending at least. I reccomend other gay-themed books (boy meets boy, foolish fire, half-life)."
5,Captivating...enchanting,"I must confess that, as a general rule, I do not like to read novels, except the ones that I write. Even then, I read only to check for punctuation, spelling, and grammar, and to hear, as I read it out loud, the cadence of the words. Things written, must also sound good. I'm a perfectionist. So, it was with some reluctance that I downloaded the free copy of CLAY'S WAY. Something about the description of the book excited my brain and made me want to dig deep to see how the author pulled it off. What I found was a masterpiece, a work that grabbed my attention and cast a spell over me. I was thirsty to keep on reading, to turn far more pages than I had ever done in one sitting. Mastbaum's style is energetic and passionate. For me, as a writer, it is also inspiring. I have a long way to go."
2,"Didn't enjoy, but can appreciate","This novel was very frustrating for me because I just could not connect with the main character, Sam. I found him attention starved and annoying. Although the author did an excellent job at portraying the character of Sam, I have a hard time getting engaged in a novel if I can't connect to the characters.Also, if you are looking for a happy, complete novel I would not recommend this one. It will leave you lost and dissatisfied."
1,Clay's Way,"This was probably the most unenjoyable book I have ever read. Inasmuch as the premise of the story was good, it was not developed at all. I do not understand the purpose of decompensating a young person from drugs, alcohol and sex.I think it would have been much better to develop the characters in a rehabilitative state, getting together.Very poor writing. Would not recommend the book to anyone"
1,Higher expectations,"A book that I had very high expectations for turned out to be a dud. The story starts off as interesting and engaging, but by part two it takes an annoying and painful turn for the worse. The story present a view not of reality but of hyper reality, the things the characters say and do are things people tend to think but would hardly, if ever, say or do out loud. Further more as you watch Clay's continued lack of acceptance of himself continuously escalates to a point where you can't help but to be angry at him, and Sam's bright eyed insistence on a happy ending in-spite of all evidence to the contrary is equally aggravating. The fact that the book ends in the matter that it does certainly doesn't help matters. All in all it starts off strong, but if you stop reading at the end of part one, you'll really be doing yourself a favor."
5,A fantastic gay coming-of-age novel with fully realized characters,"""Clay's Way"" is a riveting gay coming-of-age novel set in Hawaii. The story of Sam and Clay is an unusual one. Sam is an unhappy skateboard punk rocker who knows he is gay and is quite unhappy with his life. Clay is a surfer dude battling inner demons, unsure of his sexuality. The two form an intense friendship that leads to interactions more destructive than romantic. Sam increasingly goes beyond the fringe, leading to numerous scenes that are true page-turners. Clay is a boy in need of help that's not there, and his story is a sad one. This book has been hailed by many, and I have to agree. This is a coming-of-age story off the beaten path, and it's a must read for fans of the genre."
1,READER ABUSE,"The characters were uniformly unlikeable and I didn't find any of them to be credible---either in what they said or did (which was one stupid thing after another). Even descriptions of the physical world many times rang false. For example, back to back sentences had low moans echoing off valley walls and scared birds slapping their wings together. The novel was a pointless stream of juvenile fantasy. Younger teens (the intended market?) deserve something much better."
4,what a trip,"Sweet, funny, sexy, painful, swift, confusing and achingly honest, just like adolescence was/is ... a beautifully realized effort worthy of a sequel"
3,Good not great.,"I found that this book like the young man portrayed in its pages, is a victim of entropy. As the story goes on the writing becomes as chaotic as its fiction. There are better gay books out there but this does pass the time. I guess if you don't read often or drawn towards pulp gay mystery's or scholastic fair then this would be a wild ride but if you read anything with substance on a regular basis then you may be dreadfully dissapointed."
4,Disturbing,"Very well-written, although sometimes the narrative seems too adult to be coming from a 16-year-old. The tale is very disturbing; the main character is often out of control. Still, the events, however stark, are within the realm of believability. A good book."
2,I Must Have Read Another Book,"I really can't find anything worth recommending about this book at all. I mean, we start with a main character who's totally unlikeable, then pair him up with the even-more-unlikeable, titular Clay. And they progress, but if anything, they move backward, and not forward. I missed the descriptions of the dazzling backdrops of Oahu and Kauai that were mentioned on the back cover. And I really can't see how anyone could compare this to Catcher In The Rye, another novel about a self-absorbed, unlikeable teen, but at least that young man wised up and realized that he was in fact, self-absorbed and unlikeable.And I must confess my general distaste for fiction that doesn't end so much as stop. There are authors who make this work as a literary device, but I got a much stronger sense here that the author had just run out of things to say."
5,Punk rock literature,"First, this novel is extremely fun to read, giving its readers not only amazing characters but spot-on descriptions of places (Hawaii), people (Susan and Sam), things (Clay's tattoos and body) and events (parties and camping trips). I have read this book three times in two weeks. The boys are hot and the narrative and voice is real, raw and gritty. Excellent."
4,crazy,"I just finished this book and immediately went to Blair Mastbaums website to see if he's written anything else. This book was totally exciting, and intense. I would reccomend it to anyone who likes to get attached to the characters in a novel , and become completely emotionally involved. I'm in love with Blair Mastbaum, cant wait for another book."
2,What's the Point?,"The writing in this book is raw and honest. However, I have a hard time following the motivation behind Sam's action. He'll do something completely random or lie or just say something strange and doesn't say why he does it. There's no insight into it, despite the fact that you're inside his head while reading the story. I didn't think he was that easy to relate to, either. He was just a really crappy person. He never did anything nice for anyone, and by the end, his actions were pretty outrageous and unbelievable. The ending was disappointing. Also, there were many spelling mistakes, gramatical errors, and lots of missing punctuation. The formatting was messed up a lot, too. I thought that detracted from the readability of the book by a lot."
4,Amazing instrumental compostion from a master of a cappella,"Having been a fan of Gunnar Madsen for many years due to his work with the a cappella group The Bobs, I was still a little leary try this all-instrumental collection of waltzes. I must admit that I was more than pleasantly surprised to discover that Gunnar brought his quirky fun from the Bobs into the world of classical music. Each of the Waltzes has a distinct flavor and personality, and is a far cry from what the average person thinks of when they hear the word waltz. Mr. Madsen is constantly full of surprises."
5,Beautiful,"I first heard Gunnar Madsen on Sex and the City. I couldn't figure out what song it was, but I would play it over and over with Carrie's voice over and everything. Then I figured out it was ""Anna"" and a moment later bought this CD. It is better than I expected, only having heard ""Anna."" I play this CD all the time. It is perfect for when I'm reading, driving, cooking, doing anything. It's fabulous!"
5,Pleases the hard to please!,"I purchased this album last Christmas, as I found the on-line samples delightful. (I was first drawn to listen only because of Small Potatoes' cover of an old Bobs hit, ""Boy Around the Corner,"" which is a personal favorite!) Couldn't quite decide who to give it to, but finally added it to my parents' stack of gifts. We've searched for common musical ground for all of my 43 years, with little success-- but last summer my mother told me that this has become one of the CD's they listen to most! Now I want one of my own..."
4,Tunnel Vision,"This is actually the 2nd album release by the collectve called the Tunnel Rats. The first one is called ""Experience"" and was released back in 96. In comparison to that, I would say that this is an overall better product. Although if I was to take the best track off of the previous work and the best one off of ""Tunnel Vision,"" I would say that ""Experience"" would come out on top. It's just that the second album is more consistent. I don't know if it's really fair to compare the two, though, because many of the personnal has changed.The Tunnel Rats really are pioneers in the so-called Christian hip hop game. They weren't the first, and it can be argued if they are the best. But it cannot be denied that they changed the tide. It is because of them that crews like LA Symphony and Deepspace 5 (and the emcees within) are able to get recognition by ""secular"" hip hop fans. They are owed gratitude."
3,A couple good songs but not great.,"While a few tracks are fun to listen too, the CD as a whole is not that tight. Other Christian rappers like TBone, Grits and Sackcloth fasion are much better."
5,Art Quilt DVD a great resource,"Jane LaFazio's ""The Small Art Quilt"" is a great resource for the fiber artist. I got the DVD yesterday and watched it last night. It's wonderful! Jane is very clear in her descriptions, the instructions are easy to understand, and even though I have done some basic art quilts, I see how I can really add interest to future projects... I can't wait to put all this good information to use! I recommend it to anyone who is interested in Art Quilts as a creative outlet."
4,Great teacher; Great Class,I usually don't have the time or money to spend on mixed media art classes in today's economy so I look for informative classes on DVD's. Jane's DVD on making small art quilts is great. There are three projects on the DVD and each are explained clearly. I learned so much and it gave me a great incentive to try something a little different.
4,"A Book with Humor for Beginning Readers - a review of ""Mice!""","""Mice!"" is a book with one and two word sentences. It's vocabulary is very basic, consisting of the words: a, all, at, big, black, down, fast, few, gray, here, in, many, mice, nice, no none, out, over, slow, small, that's (the only conjunction), there, under, up, wait, and where.Despite this limitation (of 18 words), the book manages to tell a story about a lazy cat, his dog friend, and many, many mice. The dog sees the mice and tries to interest his sleeping friend in them, but lazy cat never sees the mice despite all their cavorting about. (My 3 y.o. thought it was funny.]Four Stars. [B-]. ""Mice!"" has 18 easy words in super short sentences. [Shorter than even the early Bob Books.] It tells the tale of a lazy cat and a house that is apparently full of mice. The artwork has humor and imagination.Example of text from first 4-pages follows:Mice!!Where?Here?No, there![Told you the sentences were short ;-)]"
3,3 min timer broken.,"The Bad: When I opened the package upon delivery the small box containing the timer was pressed into the corner of the larger box it arrived in. there was protective wrapping in the box however it looked like the product was placed in the box and then the wrapping was placed on top instead of being suspended for proper protection. Due to poor packaging the 3 minute timer was shattered.The OK: I tested the two other timers that were left against a digital timer and they are fairly accurate, within 5-10 seconds of 4 and 5 minutes respectively. This was accurate enough for my needs.This is my first item ever damaged from Amazon, all of my other experiences have been excellent. The timers are thin glass, the shipper should have packaged the items accordingly.For my purposes the 3 minute timer was unnecessary so I will not be returning the product, but your situation may be different."
4,Lots of fun,"I was first introduced to tea timers when my wife, Cindy, and I spent a lovely lunch at the Turnberry Hotel. We ordered tea and sandwiches, and when the service came to our table , it was complete with three small timers in a wooden rack. After understanding what they were for, I decided that this would be part of my kitchen accessories, even if was a novelty from our trip.This timer works as well as the one in Scotland, is more compact, and transports us back to that fabulous lunch. And by the way, the tea timer helps make a superb cuppa."
5,Great Gadget,Came across this gadget in a store on the lower east side in NYC. Good to know amazon has it too if I decide to get them for XmasStocking stuffers. It takes the guesswork out on how long to brew different types of tea. My English breakfast tea actually tastedBetter this morning who knew I needed this gadget in my kitchen . I'm glad I bought it.
3,Not bad,"I guess it's tough with these little timers - none of them seem to be very accurate, but this one is consistent within a few seconds, and I took the average and wrote it on the timer itself with a marker. I like the layout - it's compact and stable, and you can see all 3 timers at once if you angle it correctly."
5,A Platinum Star,"This CD has truly become one of my favorites. Carmichael's vocal talent is a gift from God and the production work on this album is a winner. Two of my favorite songs on this album, even though I love the entire CD, are #3 (You Need A Man) and #7 (Miles From Nowhere). I am anticipating his next album release because I know that it is going to be the B-O-M-B!!! Much Success and Much Love. . ."
1,Pathetic,"This book is an awful intro to building indoor rock walls. Outdated and too thin. It reccommends creating your own holds which is a good way to make poor holds. The Metolious website offers at least as much info as this book and it's free. Unfortunately, there is no other book to reccommend that covers building indoor walls. Someone still needs to write it."
1,"Well, at least I didn't pay for it","This was a free, 4-for-3 book that looked interesting and I thought would be a good way for me to put together a climbing wall for my foster children that wasn't a plastic one you get at the toy stores. Children get bored on those little tiny walls with plastic holds; I am experienced in woodworking and masonry and wanted to put something up in my basement or garage (which the book specifically promises to be geared to). I don't have a 25-foot ceiling like he does and there seems to be no way to scale down the walls (no pun intended). The entire first page basically says, ""Don't build your own wall without an architect or a structural engineer."" Thanks."
2,Book for climbers,"Althought this book was well written and a little useful, it seemed to me about making holds and construction techniques. I was looking for a book that might have info on self-belay and anchoring but the author writes that anchoring is a subject he doesn't want to write about and never mentions self-belay. He doesn't even mention floor padding for your home gym. It's a thin book for the money (26 pages) and the price per page was a little steep."
1,basic book 26 pages long,very basic book. only 26 pages long. if your looking to build your own home climbing/bouldering wall. I would recommened just doing a search on google or going to the metolius climbing website.
1,Dont buy it,"As useful as a bicycle in the middle of the ocean, probably the tires will help you as the photo of the cover of the book in order to have a good idea of how looks a climbing wall. You can get more info from the climbing holds homepages"
3,needes more blood and suspense,"The main charter kim was an all right prom comitte chairperson but the stalker was to ovious she needed to be smarter.I mean she oranized the prom.I think the story line was cool but it needed more unbelievable things, more killings, more charters and most of all a lot more suspense"
1,I Gained All My Weight Back,"The book tasted good, that's for sure, but then I think that might have been because it was one of those yellowish old books, and of course they're more nutritious, because they're already partly digested.But I was really surprised by some of the weight loss methods, especially the part where I had to tow a tractor with an ox plow... and I couldn't get anyone to take the other side of it, so it was unbalanced and really heavy...But that plus eating the book and I LOST 62 POUNDS!But then, I only weighed 130 when I started.The ER doctor pointed out that I must have left my right leg with the tractor, and that's when I passed out.Anyhow, great book, at least for eating.I only read 12 pages before I started eating it. Is the rest of it good?"
3,Teepee Creepers slippers without sole,"I was disappointed. My ""original"" TEEPEE CREEPERS, purchased from Silver Hills Trading Co. in Tombstone, AZ, were much more robust. The lining was thicker, not synthetic, and the outer ""shoe"" was also more substantial.They are very comfortable but I question their longevity."
3,Kid's scope - what do you expect?,"It's a cheap child's scope - what do you expect from it? We'll I would expect that while the focusing not to be that smooth or fine, I would expect that it didn't bind to a degree that you feel like you're going to break the cheap plastic when trying to focus it.Using the mirror for lighting purposes is useless and the bulb that's provided is barely adequate. It does have an ok grasshoper slide with different parts (antenna, legs, abdomen, wings.) My son and I gathered some other items such as grass, spices, misc bugs and made our slides with the slide kits. It's ok, but being very difficult to focus in on is annoying.Then there's the capability to 'project' the image on a wall. Ok, in a completely dark room you can project a very faint and blurry image of something on the wall.Overall, for a kid 6-8yrs old who's interested in science, this is a cheap toy to see how interested they really may be, but don't expect it to last as it's not very sturdy."
2,Microscope set,This did not live up to the description and I had two disappointed grandsons at Christmas. It was hard to see the slides and hard to focus them
2,Okay begininer Microscope,I bought this as a beginner microscope my complaints would be that its not solidly constructed and feel that it could easily break. the light/mirror is cheap overall for the price not horrible but still wish it was a bit better constructed.
1,Very dissappointed,I read the reviews and thought this would be a good first microscope for my grandson. We founf this to be very flimsy when using-primarily made of plastic and no weight. Light through view finder was very low no matter at what setting. First thing I have ever had to return .
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased this product for my son, assuming it would be the same high quality microscope I had when I was his age, it's NOT. This product is classic made in China toy junk, what a let down for both me and my son. Don't waste your money."
3,Great Starter,"I bought this for my daughter who has shown an interest. It is a lovely set , however, it is not as well made as I hoped. But it works well for my 7 year old and she loved all the accessories that came with it. I would love to give higher review, but 2 days in the base piece popped off. Sturdy its not, but is a fabulous beginner set for the price."
4,Good compilation of information,"It was a good compilation of the existing material that is already out there on trauma. I don't think that it would be a good suggestion for the average patient, because it may be difficult to maintain the focus neccessary to follow his thoughts. Patients may find selected excerpts more helpful. Patients with psychosomatic illnesses will be happy to find a doctor who sees some rational behind their disorders."
5,Caregiver must read. Every medical student the first year.,"This will be a classic.Scaer broke ground in actually listening to his patients even though like all allopaths his training was to force them into a diagnostic mold.M.D. stands for M.inor D.iety and yet Robert has been able to humble himself and become part of the team for one goal, What's Best for the Patient."
1,Why didn't I read the reviews?,I only have myself to blame for buying this book.I showed it to an Iranian friend and asked his opinion. He threw it across the room and gave me a tired look.I just left it there.
1,poor,"This dictionary usually only has one sense of each word sometimes less. For example, today I was trying to look up ""groceries"" and all it has in it is ""grocer"". From that I can't tell how to say my original query and I'm left wondering if ""grocer"" refers to the place/store or the guy that works there. Flip through these pages and see how much white space there is. In comparison, my Mandarin-English dictionary is about the same sized book but jam packed containing idiomatic expressions and example usages. When I bought this I didn't have other options. All I could find were unidirectional dictionaries at the time so I got this one. In retrospect, I'd rather have half a good dictionary than a poor full one."
1,Dont get the book,"This book is garbage, total oshkhal, dont get it if you wantto make sncse to any one"
2,OK for a word list,"I would not recommend buying this as a dictionary; especially, not if it is to be a desk reference or a primary source. If you are looking for a handy word list (8400 entries split about evenly; I'd give it an extra star as a word list.) that will fit in your briefcase or book bag, then it is serviceable. I am 6 months into studying Farsi and have found a couple of errors, have been bothered by some of the usage and feel that getting the alphabet out of order (nan, he, vav, ye) is really bad form in a dictionary. I still use it because of the handy size and it was cheap, after all. Also, this - and the other review of disappointment - speak to why publishers should use Amazon's 'see inside this book' feature. I now need a good dictionary but I am reluctant to buy without at least knowing number of entries - if not style."
3,Good for tourists or beginners only,"Good for getting the basic words but not much help in finding variations of root words. Linguists or native speakers will find this dictionary very frustrating.It is not laid out in the fashion necessary for Farsi script and has no variations on any words. In fact, the only information given is the Persian/Farsi word, pronuciation, English word and Eglish pronunciation. I would never have purchased this dictionary had I known this."
1,Quite worthless,"I have never seen so useless a pocket dictionary. During my visit in Iran, I almost never fond any of the day-to-day words I was looking for, instead I got ""perspiration"", ""indigenious"", and ""chahaarnal raftan"". It's simply a word list with one translation to each post and its word class. No phrases, not even a list of numerals."
2,hmmmm....,Not quite what we were expecting. Thought it would be a full episode but what we got was more or less a generic advertisement for military families. Will not get anything like this again.
5,Great Videos to Help Preschoolers Discuss Difficult Issues,"This free series contains videos that deal with issues children may face such as a parent in the military being deployed, bullying, death, etc. They are meant to be watched with a parent present and help children who may be too young to know how to express their feelings. They are meant to help start a dialogue through discussing the experiences of characters they are familiar with who are facing situations similar to their own."
3,Great show for Toddlers!,"My goddaughter actually liked this, which is weird because she doesn't like to many kid shows. This is great to put on for the little ones if you need a break."
3,Not our favorite Sesame Street video,Most SS videos hold my granddaughters attention. This one not so much. Perhaps its a little too serious. Or not enough music.
2,Receiving Clannad: Greatest Hits CD was a very good experience....,I received this CD with two others from the same vendor at Amazon....the entire experience was top notch from ordering to finally recieving the package (which was very professional and protective for the CD's. I would definitely order from this vendor again!
2,"Enough ""Best of"" cd's already!",Let's hear some new releases. I think this group has been resting on their laurels long enough. Time for some new songs folks!
4,I've owned it for a while and listen to it often.,I love this CD. The music is transforming. Buy this and others like it and you wont be disappointed.
4,Great look at early Idaho crime and prison history,"This is a great book for anyone interested in the life of a small time criminal in Idaho in the 1920's. Mostly written by the man himself, it detalis the life of ""Derby Jones"" from his beginnings in Arkansas, through his bootlegging days in Twin Falls, and subsequent time spent at the Old Pen. Because it was written by the man himself it brings his unique voice to us. His son edited and lightly revised the work. These additions and explinations only add to the richness of the book. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Idaho, Prison, the 1920's, and authentic voices from our past. This man lead an interesting and exciting life in an interesting and exciting time. A must read"
2,Too Much Too Bland,"It's too bad that about 12 of the songs were on this set. Ella & Nelson can't make those 12 listenable. I feel that this is far too costly for its mediocrity. It does have great stuff on it but not enough! Her Oh Lady Be Good is well worth it because of containing only great Gershwin. I do love My Cousin In Milwaukee which describes Ella's singing style. OK, MILWAUKEE IS MY HOME TOWN. Rather, than this, Ella's Rodgers & Hart Songbook deserves to have been a massive box set: 51 songs plus the instrumental Slaughter on 10th Ave."
4,Room One: A Mystery or Two review,"I enjoyed reading Room One: A Mystery or Two. I didn't want to stop reading it. It was unpredictable and exciting. I did not like the end of it, though. I think April and her family should have stayed in Plattsford and gotten their own house and gone to the school in Plattsford. Then the school would not have to shut down."
4,My daughter is begging to read,"My daughter is almost 9, and eariler this year her third grade class read Frindle...this week she checked out Room One from the library. Usually when she reads, she is watching the clock to see if her 20 minutes is up, for the third night in a row, when I went to her room to say goodnight, she begged to keep reading. Time for more from this author, I have been waitng for her to find a book she likes to read.....now we have it."
2,Not Impressed,"I found this story very average. Just so-so, not a page-turner. The writing is average, the story is average. I was surprised that the author didn't seem to know about point of view. He kept hopping heads in the same scene--very amateurish. I advise you not to waste your money. If you want to read it, go to the library."
1,Room One,"Longtime Clements reader and I have to say, this book is just horrible. It's completely lacking all of the charm we have come to know and love from all of his other books, and I don't understand where that disappeared to. Before you say, well, maybe you're just too old for the books now, I'd just like to say that I still read Frindle and the School Story and others, and they're still as good as when I first read them, if not better.There's almost no character interaction or character development. It's simply boring.The cultural references also threw me off, they're supposed to be timeless stories, not stories with iPods and Gameboys and wars in Iraq. They should be happening to anyone, anywhere.I just didn't like the tone. It's nothing like his old works. If you're a fan of the classic Clements books, I strongly recommend you spare yourself a few minutes and pick another Andrew Clements book to read, cause this one's just not worth it."
4,Not a bad knife,"...It's an OK knife for the price. The main advantage over other knives is the adjustable clip (a roller wheel can tighten the clip quickly for a different set of pants, rather than removing and bending the clip on other knives). If you are browsing for a knife on Amazon, your other option for a low-weight folder with a clip is the Gerber EZ-Out series. The Gerbers have a rough finish that makes even stainless steel develope rust spots within days, even in dry areas.There is a larger model Autoclip, but this one is just big enough for an average hand and quick everyday tasks. If you have larger hands or need the knife for extended use, I would get the larger Autoclip or the Magna-DOT (best handle for heavy work, but no clip)."
3,it's so hard to make anything out of this dvd,"i gave this dvd 3 stars for its eccentricity--which in some circles may be viewed as creativity. otherwise i think the whole thing swings between charlatanry and a few artistic sparks.earlier on, sun ra might have done some things associable with creativity, but has not shown he knows music from noise/cacophony. as far as liberating creativity is concerned, i'd stay with ornette coleman..."
5,Beautiful and highly informative book,"I bought this book when I started thinking about new landscaping for our backyard. It gave me many great ideas. It is full of sensible, practical advice and also of creative inspiration."
2,"Seguridad Social, or the art orf repeating itself","I listened to Seguridad Social during my last days of High School. Yes, they were impressive, they played hard their guitars and Juan Manuel Casañ's bully voice made you think about not going to school. Oh glorious days. But time passes over you, and although it is always good to listen to ""Me Siento Bien"" and ""Quiero Tener Tu Presencia"", you realized that you paid for ""Un Beso Y Una Flor"" and not for ""Furia Latina"" (the first album to include this songs).""Un Beso Y Una Flor"" is not a Greatest Hits album (as it was ""Compromiso De Amor"") yet you are condemned to listen to it as if it is. It is not what I Expected for my bucks, but heck! it is always good to walk down your High School paths for a little while."
3,Again!,"My - as of the time this review - nineteen month old son likes this more than I do. He'll ask for it ""Again!"" and hear it five times - my limit! I can't help being bugged by ""sssh"" instead of ""shhh"" though."
3,Not everyone will like this...,"My daughter is 2. She has always loved music and dance. So purchasing this DVD seemed like a no-brainer. Yes, she loves it -- especially the tap dance/rap skit. I'm glad that Elmo only shows up briefly (I'm a little Elmo'ed out). I agree with other reviewers that Paula is very under-dressed for a pre-school video and the hip-hop dance has to go! The dances are complicated, but the point is that the kids are getting up and moving around. They are trying to get the feel of ballet or African or tap. So what if they aren't always on count? Who is? It's fun to watch and follow along. Good buy if your kid has the rhythm!"
3,Entertaining but not as good as other Sesame St DVD's,"It is great that dances from around the world are shown & the whole thing is very upbeat & ""peppy"", but the moves are shown very quickly and are much too difficult for little ones to follow. Zoes silly willy nilly dance is probably the highlight for so many youngsters mentioned because it is easy to do! If your little one has an interest in dance then maybe it would be a good buy. If not buy one with more of their favorite characters in that they can sing and dance along to."
2,Too much blah blah blah,"I am SOOOOO disappointed with this video. There is way too much talking and not enough dancing and music. When they do dance, the steps are very complicated...I couldn't follow it, much less my 3 years olds and 18 month old. My little dancer likes to watch it because it has Zoe, but she just watches, she doesn't dance. It's educational...that is the only reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1."
1,Horrible,"I agree with the other reviews, this video was horrible and I wish I hadn't wasted my money! I too thought it was suppose to be a great video for kids to learn all different types of dances...instead we got Paula in a tight outfit doing intro's to dances that are too complicated for non-professional adults never mind three year olds. Not to mention 80% of the video are old clips of dances for Sesame Street that are from the 80's. Horrible waste of money, don't bother!!!!"
3,Its a little busy,"I got this DVD for my 3 and a half year old who is now into dancing after reading some reviews I thought it would be a good one. I think its okay. The first half is mainly showing different dances and its confusing becuase they say ""follow me"" or "" can you do it?"" etc and start dancing pretty fast. then the rest of the movie starts the teaching part. The teaching part is not to bad but probably for a child who have already had some danceing practices or an older child. I think the just dance for kids for Wii is better... or baby ballet."
4,Great DVD for kids,I think this is a fantastic DVD! My 2year old can watch it 3 times in a row and is learning all the dance moves. It is also very entertaining for adults as well. I love the fact that it exploress ALL cultures of dance. A definite keeper!
1,Zoe's Dance Moves needs more Elmo!,Not a hit with my 2 1/2 year old son. The only parts that grabbed his attention were when Elmo was on screen. Waste of money.
2,Not the best sesame street video,Both my 2 year old and I found this video paled next to the others in her sesame street collection. There wasn't enough variation in characters or plot and the dance step sequences were pretty complex for the targeted audience. We made it through the whole thing once but I'm guessing that will be the only time.
4,produced the biggest rainbow spectrum then any other device I owned,"What can I say it is a rainbow maker. I am playing around with strobing for photography and wanted some lighting effects. I tried crystal and they are useless. I couldn't really used these for my strobe, but still working on way to get it to cast a rainbow with a flash. As for natural light on this, it is excellent. Works great, but I got it for stobing protrait photography."
3,Needs a better description,"After reading product description and all reviews, I obviously did not have a complete understanding of this product. This products displays a ""wheel spoke"" of rainbow colors. I mean: long, thin, spokes of color - MANY, THIN, spokes all over the room. This may be fun for a kids room, but it did not work well for my mother's nursing home room - too much ""In your face"" color. I have many different types of prisms and enjoy the ""soft"" rainbow colors that ""float"" around the room. These are not that kind of prism. I had also ordered one for myself, but have since placed it in the yard sale bin along with my mother's. I should have stuck with the old tried and true prisms. I gave this product a higher rating than I would have, due to the fact that it may have an application that I was not looking for."
3,Casts an interesting pattern,"I have this stuck on a south facing window. At mid day with direct sunlight it will cast a fan of colors on the floor stretching out 8 to 10 feet form the window. It is different from the crystal prisms hung by a string and not as intense, but still quite pleasant."
1,terrible,"didn't cast ""rainbows"" at all on wall.made of cheap plastic and sticker'slittle rain got on it and it broke, (clear, no refraction)"
4,Cool indoor rainbows!,This suncatcher casts beautiful rainbows on the walls of my kitchen. I have really enjoyed it!
3,Brings color to the room,"I was nervous and skeptical about this having read some of the other Amazon reviews on the item. Placed in an east-facing window, it does create some nice rainbows in our living room during the morning though. My kids love it. It's probably a little overpriced, but it's not really super-expensive to begin with, so whatever. I'm sure it'll keep making rainbows for us to enjoy."
3,suncatcher rainbow,I had the double moving rainbow catcher and I liked it better because it moved around. This one is nice for a stand still rainbow
5,WOW!! Colorful prisms galore.,"Bought two, one for friend and one for myself. Mannn when the morning sun hits this suncatcher...P O W!!! Rainbows galore. Very beautiful intense color. Sometimes I catch myself going into a trance staring at the brilliant rainbows. Great item. Made my friends two story open stairwell glow with color."
1,Disappointed,The reason for my disappointment......... a tape on the glass could not be removed.........the rainbow certainly did not reflect as reflected into the room.
1,Doesn't work.,"It just doesn't...work. It's weird. Before this I always had actual prisms, and this doesn't produce anywhere near the kind of vibrant rainbows and light play that those do. In super strong, direct sunlight it only makes fuzzy, weak rainbows that only show on surfaces that are really close to it. It's possible that I got a defective one."
5,Suncatcher dancing rainbows,"A treasured cousin recently was widowed, having lost the lifelong love of her life. Ever since, she has considered rainbows as special reminders of his enriching spirit. Sometimes I send our love to her in the form of rainbow themed tokens.She reported that this suncatcherSuncatcher - Rainbow Axicon Window Sun Catcher - These Suncatcher are Great for Feng Shuihad arrived and was installed in her kitchen window during an unusually long cloudy stretch. On the first sunny morning thereafter, imagine her surprise and delight, therefore, to discover scores of rainbows surrounding her everywhere, at every level of her kitchen! She called us promptly to report having been warmly enveloped, pleasurably resplendent, and frequently reminded.LM144"
5,"Awesome knife, easy open, easy close.","My wife got me this knife for christmas a couple years ago, and I love it. Opens easily w/ a thumb motion and flick of the wrist, and closes just as easily.Only problem I've had, is in toting it in my pocket (not clipped to anything) I've poked myself on the tip 2 or 3 times, I think I somehow managed to snag the thumb release while in my pocket.I am purchasing another one to replace the one I lost on my last vacation. I've been really annoyed at not having it for the couple of days I haven't had it. I pretty much carry it all the time and feel naked w/o it."
5,BEST KNIFE I HAVE EVER OWNED,"This knife is the perfect size to clip to your pocket. It is not too long. I sit and drive all day,and it is very comfortable. It is sharp, and it stays sharp! Extremely functional.....You bet it is. The Tiger Tooth Tip, lenth of blade, and the serrated portion are a great combination. I was concerned about the serration, but this is the best. The teeth are not so deep they grab, and stop the blade. They do cut!With 5 minutes practice, anyone can learn to open it with a flip of the wrist. A surprisingly eye popping move that makes a statement. I love the knife."
5,SOG's best Folder!,"Absolutely the best folder I have owned. I have used and collected knives for 30 years and the SOG Pentagon Elite I is my favorite. Multiple features combine to make this the top of the line. (1) The blade steel is tough and holds an edge even with hard use. (2) The half straight / half serration edge allows good normal slicing cuts and positive cutting for fibrous material such as rope. (3) The shape of the point is unique in that it is a short inverted ""V"" design. I like this because it has less chance of the point breaking, always a concern, over the long thin stiletto points seen in other designs."
4,dont just watch the movies,have you read the manga MPD-Psycho?this movie is originally based on the manga [japanese comic book]the manga itself is a masterpieceso i think you shouldn't comment about the story just by watching the movie onlygrab the manga too!
1,Garbage,"This stuff is just awful. One would think something that will not be going on a flat surface, like a car door, would be flexable, soft easy to maneuver... nope this crap just breaks off into other pieces like cheap plastic. Ok so the adhesion should be decent, it has to stay on the door... nope. Hardly the case here, i had to try and screw it to the door, which ended up cracking the damn thing. Overall i ended up returning it, cause it just wasnt gonna work."
3,Rebels in the Shadows,"This book follows an Irish family mining in the hills of Pennsylvania and their involvement with the Molly Maguires, a secret society fighting-- and killing-- for miners' rights. This is not a book I would have sought out to read, but I'm glad that I happened upon it. I've actually found myself looking around for people like the two strongest male characters-- Captain Mike and Red. And this book does an excellent job of relating the real life troubles and joys of the mining communities that fueled our country's industrial booms. Something is lacking in this book, but its intentions are honorable and the combination of fact and fiction does make it enjoyable to read. I'd give it two and three-quarter stars or a B+."
5,I'm very pleased.,The record came to me in perfect shape I'mvery happy with it. Thank - You so much.
5,Very sweet book,"This cute little book tells the story of a Grand-Father teaching his Grand-Childen how to protect the different forts of Christianity and how to apply them in daily lives. Even today, 120 years after it was published, there is still soemthing to learn from this little book."
1,Think before you buy,"I purchased this tape to share with my Pre-K class. The author tells authentic tales and has a wonderful voice (gift!) for oral storytelling. However, I decided not to share this tape with my class for several reasons: First, the protagonist is named Juan Bobo a.k.a. John Dumb. I didn't want my four year olds to run home and tell Mom they are learning about Bobos and being dumb. Second, The story La cucarachita Mandinga ends with the husband (rat) being killed in a stewpot and the wife is crying over him. Not a happy picture for a young listener. Also, the tale Gallo y Su Moneda repeats the phrase ""I'm going to kill you!"" To be honest, I couldn't even listen to the second side of this tape. Consider your audience before sharing it."
5,Excellent Resource,"I've had this book for a few years now, and refer to it often. While it wasn't written to replace ""Bruce Lee's Fighting Methods"" series, it definitely compliments it. I have a whole bookcase full of books on Bruce Lee and so called Jeet Kune Do experts and Sifu's. Some are good, some not so good. While the book was not meant to be thorough, Sifu Lamar Davis goes through all the basics, the Bai Jong stance, footwork, defense, offense, strategies, etc. Nothing fancy, just straight to the point self defense. I see there are plenty of bad reviews listed, and I honestly don't know know. Perhaps these individuals have an axe to grind with the author, as most of the negative reviews were ""anonymous"". I highly recommend the book. I also highly recommend the DVD series, both on Amazon and on Sifu Lamar Davis' website. They are very thorough!"
4,Thumbs up,Great book. Full of details with lots of photos. Should give a serious student something to chew over in their spare time. Begginers will love it.
1,A Great Start.....then a huge nose dive!,"I was very excited about this book. I read some of the reviews, and I thought this was going to be one of the defining books about Bruce Lee's art. It is not!The book started off in a fantastic way. It was no nonsense, and chock full of great information. The first few chapters were what a JKD book should be, then it took a huge nose dive!I was amazed and extremly disapointed to see that over HALF THE BOOK was nothing more then Sifu Davis going through a bunch of Trapping Progressions and Kick-boxing Movements. This has nothing to do with what would happen on the street.Sifu Davis could have done much better. This book is 'ok', but that's about it. It is nothing to get excited about and I would not waste my money on it.If you are very new to Jeet Kune Do, then I guess you would get something out of it, but if you are anything past an absolute beginner....move on to an another book."
1,"Macho, macho man...","Aweful book on a great subject. Has 100 pages of meathead Lamar punching and kicking some guy who isn't fighting very well. Gives very little info on technique and philosophy, and does not address groundfighting, which is where 90% of the fights i've had have ended up. The author seems to be self-righteous in his approach to Lee's art, and claims his methods are exactly the same as taught by Lee. If you want to explore Lee's art, get the books authored by Lee, some wing chun books, and maybe some books by Lee's personal students. This guy is just a beefy, angry person trying to make a buck, and capitalize on Lee's art. He should capitalize on his own art and stop giving Lee a bad name."
1,bad book,"Please do you a favour and do not buy this book. This is only a very bad copy of many books previously written about JKD. If you have read Bruce Lee's Fighting Method books, you don't need this book at all."
1,"Grimace for me, Baby!",Davis makes great faces and looks ready to blame VanDammes next bad guy but the book is mostly a rehash of old material.
4,Worth your money,"Finally a book that doesn't have the same old photos and text. This is one of the best JFJKD books on the market for those already familiar with the subject...This is a very practical book that does not insult the readers reading level.My two gripes are: half the book are photos of ""techniques"" against a stationary assailant and the overuse of exclamation points!!! Therefore 4 stars."
2,Just another JKD book,"I was a little disappointed because a lot of potential for this book was wasted. The first 80 pages or so stand up to the title and explain the scientific fundamentals of JKD. But then when you're hungry for advanced principles and concepts applicable to streetfighting you're left alone. The rest is simply a picture collection of fighting scenes you've seen in at least a hundred other books. If you're at a beginner's level this might be a nice book, but if your advanced (in any fighting art)and interested more in principles than techniques look for a better one."
4,Very good overview,"Very good product indeed !If you are looking for a practical, easy to follow introduction to JKD applied for the street, this is for you.The book has good quality photos, and after an initial part where the theory and general JKD aspects are covered, the street scenarios are covered: various defenses against different attacks."
5,A must have if you love baseball,"This book is awesome... First of all, it's huge - about 18"" x 12"" and 400+ pages. Each page is copy of a newspaper, going back to 1857, with stories about significant events in baseball's history. Reading the non-baseball stories and advertisements is almost as good as the baseball stuff. I highly recommend this book!"
4,For seniors only?,"I've bought this book, and I thinks it not so bad. If you're into baseball from 1860 to 1950 this one is for you, but the stories from the 60s to the 90s is not so well covered. It is many pages I would like to have, for example more on expansion teams, player's strike, my favourite team the St. Louis Browns and of course stories about unassisted triple plays. In the 80's section the most stories are about world series winners (but not all, both Pete Rose and the Pine-Tar case is there). I would recommend it for every old baseball fan, and of course fans who like to trace the history. Bam's last game is covered, so is The Ironman, and BoSox first win in the WS are also well covered. Ed Gaedel is also one story that I liked. But the author could have add more pages from the modern times of baseball. If you buy this book, be sure to have a magnifying glass, many of the articles are written in very small types"
5,"Simply Beautiful, Great Blues Piano","Sadly, I discovered Charles Brown only after he died, in a rememberance piece on NPR on the occasion of his death, as a matter of fact. I would have loved to have seen him perform.I have a few other of his albums, but this is my favorite, made shortly before his death. Every song is full of swing, soul, irony -- in short, the blues. The guy has a great voice and plays a mean piano. Tightly arranged but lots of room for improvization.I was big into blues a decade ago, but I've collected less blues in recent years, turning more to jazz, both instrumental and vocal. This is just on the cusp of real blues and polished vocal jazz. Hearing it again as I write this review, it may be among my top 10 favorite albums (out of a collection or around 1,000). Every song is a winner."
4,One Thing Missing...,"The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it is missing something spectacular... Ryan's version Viva La Vida!! I had the priviledge of watching them this past fall in concert and I will readily admit that this was one of the best songs/performances of the night!! I was really hoping that Viva La Vida would make it onto the DVD and the CD. So far, I haven't heard if it will maybe be a bonus track or not on the CD.Besides that, I thoroughly enjoyed Heritage! A Place in the Choir has to be one of my favorites!! :)"
5,Best DVD ever,"I received this DVD after pre-purchasing it late last year. I have all of their albums except for the Christmas one, which I didn't really care for. The Heritage album is a must!!!! I found myself sitting on the couch singing and clapping along with the guys and the audience. The album is just fantastic, I'm looking forward to more coming out. I will really miss Paul as will all of us and can only hope his replacement will be at least half as good. I will certainly start looking for something new from Paul when he gets settled and going on with his career. Good Luck to all the Thunder guys. L. Stickers"
4,Great gift,Bought this for Christmas as a gift. Thought it was great when i saw it. My mom loved it too!
5,Celtic Thunder: Heritage,"Excellent DVD of the group's live performance. SUCH TALENT! Appeals to everyone from 6yrs. (my grandson) to 60yrs. (that's me). Our favorite song is ""Place in the Choir"". Sure wish they toured the U.S."
5,Excellent DVD,This is the fifth DVD that Celtic Thunder has released. We saw part of it on PBS one night and wanted to see the rest of it. I own the entire collection currently on DVD. Great music! If you have never checked Celtic Thunder out look up a video or two on Youtube/VEVO. I think you'll like them.
5,Excellent music,"This is great music. My family is going through two battles with serious cancer, my daughter and my husband. This show and it's music gives me peace. The show is well paced, there is variety where needed. I can watch this show, and listen to this music, and escape. It is beautiful and I appreciate it."
5,Celtic Thunder Heritage,"This may be the best of Celtic Thunder -- I sang, danced, swooned [they are a handsome bunch!] and had a super time. The finale of ""All God's Creatures Have A Place In The Choir"" is great fun and really shows off their individual abilities. So glad I bought it!!!"
5,Great show for the family,"I pre-ordered the DVD and was pleased that it arrived the week the DVD was released. My children and I love to watch Celtic Thunder, the kids always end up dancing along with the songs! I was also able to recieve a better price from when I had pre-ordered the DVD. I will definitely pre-order new releases thru Amazon again."
2,Love it but where are the rest of the songs?,Neither the CD nor DVD have all the songs of this concert on them. Even if you get both you're still missing a few. WHY go to all the trouble of creating the CD and DVD and leave off music? If you have too many for one CD there are sets out there... you could easily charge a bit more and have a double CD for sale.Disappointed in my purchase.... but I still love the music.
3,"Sorry, disappointed","Sorry, I'm out of step with most of the other reviews here. I love these young singers and the musical accompaniments. The first DVD 'The Show', heavily promoted by SBS, the multicultural, multilingual TV channel in Australia, was enthralling.The production quality of 'Heritage' is less than enthralling. Staging: a creased, tatty, old backcloth. Lighting: hit and miss with apparently minimum resources. Sound: poor, due to the use of different types of mike and recording system. Audience: shouting and screaming every time one of the lads appeared or simply turned to face a different direction. And why they had to keep waving fluorescent green sticks is beyond my understanding. Lovely songs, wonderful voices, great music, but such a disappointing recording on DVD."
5,Amazing show,"In ""Heritage"", the Celtic Thunder men get back to their traditional roots. This show does not have a lot of choreography or flash compared to some of their other shows, but it is pure enjoyment from start to finish. The DVD I purchased works flawlessly and the boys are in top form. It's a must-have for any Celtic Thunder fan!"
3,Disappointing,"I love the Celtic Women but was very disappointed in the Celtic Men. Their performances are emotionless, their vocal phrasing stale and stiff, and their overall performance bland. The only bright spot in the whole peformance was the young teen that they added. He was cute and a much better performer than the adult men in the group."
5,2nd Greatest only behind It's Entertainment,I love this DVD. I just purchased the CD so I can listen to them all the time. The music and set up for the whole thing is awesome. They are for every age and extremely entertaining.
4,Love this concert,"Had never heard of this show, but saw it on PBS one day and watched it, was so good, I decided to buy it. It is a great show of some of the best singing I've ever heard, these guy have great voices. I would love to see the show live."
1,This is Abighor not Abigor,"Caution to Abigor fans, this album is by a different band. ....and they are not black metal at all."
5,Salsoul Nugget (If You Wanna),"The days of disco are coming back! This upbeat and catchy dish of cool grooves and smooth meolidies is reminiscent of the 70s - in a good way of course. The sweet-as-sugar vocals from The Girl Next Door provide this tune with a poppy feel while still maintaining its retro cool - fab! I can guarantee it'll have you up and dancing in no time, and it'll be stuck in your head long after. This top track from M&S is a spring must have - so what are you waiting for? Lets go shopping!"
3,LT1 spark plug wires,"Good OEM part except they are NOT MARKED with the cylinder numbers like my originals! For the amount of money I spent on these, they should have been exactly like my original wiring set. I could have gone to NAPA if I wanted something different. Good luck on installing these. It took me several hours since the wire hold-downs are inaccessable in many locations and I had to remove the A/C compressor to gain access to the left bank."
5,Corvette spark plug wires,"went on fine...worked fine...got rid of the car, so I can't tell you how long they'll last...but it was nice to be able to get this price and quality online..."
5,Great Quality Knife,"I ordered this pocket knife and was very pleased with it. When it arrived, it was razor-sharp and has held an edge very well. The material that makes up the handle and clip is a very strong, lightweight material that seems to resist scratching. I had another clip-type knife made by a reputable company and the clip broke off within a week and the plastic (?) handle was cracked within a week as well. This SOG knife far surpasses the other and I would definitely buy another."
5,A great introduction into why Genesis was written.,"Hyers does a great job of clearly stating some of the major questions that the creation story was meant to answer. Written in a way that is accessible to the layman, it still has many insightful conclusions for the educated."
2,Written specifically for those with a PHD in Divinity,"Conrad Hayes might have achieved more if he had written this book for the laymen who is looking for answers and arguments to support Creationism. I was extremely disappointed with the book as I found it to be the most difficult book to understand that I have ever read. His use of words is so far above the norm that would limit its readers to a very small percentage of the population. For the average person, don't waste your time."
3,experimental,"This band is made up of Brain Degraw and Harmony Korine, who is a famous indie filmaker. (Gummo, Julien Donkey Boy, Kids) The music sounds as experimental as his films, and there is a strong tribal krautrock influence. Pretty good, but not exactly easy listening."
4,A new sound for erentxun,"This one is definitly different for erentxun while it features a more distorted sound, faster pace, a different style production. That having been said, it still is quite enjoyable. Mikel has always had a way to let the vocals carry the song and give it character. I do enjoy the faster tunes""frases mudas"" and ""naif"" (except for the guitar solos) and ""ahora se que estas"" and ""el cielo es del color de las hormigas"" are fine as well. I think most of his fans recognise the great effort here."
5,the complete book of outdoor suvival,This is one of the best suvial books i have ever read. The book is very clear and easy to understand.It has everything you need for a basic camping trip to any adventure in the outdoors.
2,Hard to Install,I have installed Sears units and other In-Sink-Erator units and I will not install this model again. It has a very poor connection between the hot water unit and the dispenser. The nylon nut that secures the 1/4 copper tube to the hot water unit does not work. Or should I say it does not work when you are lying on your back under a sink with limited mobility! I called 1-800-558-5700 and asked them what to do and they said to keep tightening it until it stops leaking. The directions however say tighten it finger tight and then turn it with a wrench no more than 3 turns or it may crack the unit. And by the looks of the water jacket it will crack.This is a new design the older models sealed this connection. I guess in the efforts to save 12 cents on a brass fitting quality has gone out the window.
2,Good thing for warranties!,"I own this unit. In fact I've owned about 4 of these units. Unfortunatly they've all been on the same sink in about a 2 year period. When they work, they work great. No waiting for water to heat up on the stove for instant coffee, cocoa, tea, oatmeal etc. The first two units just stopped heating after about 3 or 4 months. The third unit was just very noisy. The 4th is still workinig great after 2 whole months. Luckily they failed within the warranty period so they were replaced. I'm not sure if the problem is from being on well water or not. My water is filtered but not softened because it's not that hard. Instant hot water is nice to have, I'm just not sure this is the right brand to buy. I don't think I'll buy another in-sink-erator if mine ever outlives the warranty!"
1,Knuckbuster Install; Heater rustout in 3 years,"I was disappointed to find that the ring used to hold the faucet down to the sink is extremely difficult to reach and tighten. Never did get it fully tight.After only 3 years (thats the warranty period)I had a massive leak from the heater unit which is non-repairable - obviously corroded out. Did a number on my cabinet. $200 for the faucet, $100 damage to the cabinet and several hours to install and repair.Not what I'd call a quality product."
2,"Great when it works, but not very durable","I guess we should consider ourselves lucky, as our unit (professionally installed) lasted 6 years until it started a slow leak under the heating unit where the electric cable enters the box (that in itself worries me). Now, I realize these things are 'on' all the time, keeping the water hot, and hot wet things *will* degrade over time, but it seems like a bad design and/or cheap washer, gasket, seal, etc. is the cause of these problems. I will see if there is anything I, as the end consumer, can do to fix this, but am not very optimistic, given the other postings here."
2,Add $100 for the plumber,"Don't let the packaging fool you. This is NOT self-installable by anyone without some sort of plumbing knowledge.I ended up spending $100 on an electician to add an outlet [had to split a switched circuit], then after several hours intalling the unit myself, another $100 on a plumber to reinstall the saddle valve I botched.All told, I'm out $350, about 10 hrs of time [including wrangling contractors], some knuckle skin and a sore neck.This thing better be good..."
4,InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP Food Waste Disposer,I used this product in my other homes and it worked fine so I installed it in my new home. It works fine here also.
2,Leaked after 5 years,"Same problem as a lot of people writing reviews. We had this installed when our house was built, and 5 years later we started to notice water under the sink. We were able to locate two cracks on the side of the plastic housing, which caused it to drip and spray under the sink. It worked great until that."
2,You need a couple more things,"Yet another unit made in communist china by ninnies that never replaced a disposal in their lives. The wrench provided to detach the previous Badger won't survive the torque needed.MAKE SURE YOU GET PLUMBERS PUTTY. I assumed the unit came with what I needed, I am stoopid. It doesn't.MAKE SURE YOU GET PENETRATING OIL: If you are replacing a worn out unit, there'll be rust that formed on the attaching flange on the el cheapo steel used. Spray all the way around the attachment mechanism and then go to lunch or Lowes to buy a large hammer. Give it an hour for the oil to do it's deed. Then go at it with hammer and wrench. I found an extra person was needed with a crowbar to provide counter pressure on the Sink side of the flange. That finally allowed the two of us manly men to separate the old unit from the sink side of the attachment mechanism."
2,housing cracked,"same failure mode as Paul: housing split vertically down the back, spraying water in cabinet when used. we've used it lightly for a year."
1,low quality product,"When you turn the the diposer, the crunching sound is very large. After one moth, egde started leaking. not money worth."
1,Poor Quality - avoid,"After a couple years the unit started freezing up - it's simple enough to loosen with an allen wrench from the bottom, and I'm okay with that once. It's become progressively more frequent, now out of warranty and time to replace with a different brand. They don't make them like they used to, and repair parts are discontinued."
1,Cracked Housing,"Just read a lot of reviews about the InSinkErator Badger 5 food waste disposer noting a common problem with a cracked housing. Mine is almost 5 years old (installed with the house) and sure enough, it has a cracked housing. Defective product!InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP Food Waste Disposer"
1,Will not last,I have lived in my house for only ten years and have alread had two garbage disposals. The last one purchased at home depot was the Badger 5. This one lasted less than 4 years. It worked fine while it worked. Just this week I found a ton of water under my sink and found that the flywheel seal was toast. I thought I could replace it but the service department indicated that the body is made of plastic and can not be serviced without a high cost. They indicated it would be most cost effective to buy a new one.I will and I plan to purchase a different brand. Don't fool yourself I am an Engineer and know they can do better than this.
2,Started leaking and needed replacement after 4 years,It worked fine for about 4 years until it started leaking from the reset button at the bottom of the unit. Apparently this is a common problem in this unit. The problem couldn't be fixed and we had to replace it by a new garbage disposal. I would hope that a garbage disposal lasts longer than that. It was pretty noisy too.
2,leaks from bottom shortly after warranty expiration,It's been said over and over. Insinkerator garbage disposal products are designed to fail. Add my experience to the list of anecdotal evidence. This is my second one gone bad. I have a couple of rental units and it sucks when a disposal fails out the bottom of the casing or the bolt on the bottom. Tenants do not always notice or call immediately leading to further damage of cabinetry. Do not be lulled into buying another Badger just because you know the installation will work well with your existing set-up. I am switching to waste king. I give it two stars rather than one cause it was relatively inexpensive and they did at least last a few years.
2,Badger 5,"The Badger 5 came with the condo. At around 2 years I started to notice a few drops of brown liquid on the cabinet floor. I let it go for a while because it just wasn't that bad at the time. Well, it is now. The housing is cracked badly. run the sink, turn on the disposal and watch the waterworks. Not fun."
1,InSinkErator 1/2 hp - Internal leak after 3 years,My old disposal lasted about 7 years before motor failure. This one developed an internal leak and had to be replaced after only 3 years.
1,Should be called the floor annihilator,"First one failed after a couple years...locked up. Second one lasted a couple years longer...only to leak all over the bottom of the cabinet and onto the floor. If you have wood floors this can be a disaster. Did some research and found this is a common problem with several InSinkErators. The corrode, the housings crack. Ours leaked right through the center...out the cord opening. Before we noticed a leak we noticed the disposal always stank. I suspect it was because filthy ground matter leaked into an area where it wasn't getting washed away with a rinse. We had been bleaching it...but had to do that often. No more InSinkErators for us."
1,Horrible quality!,We are on our third Badger in 5 years. They last at best 2 years then fall completely apart. The housing just cracks. I do not recommend this product at all.
4,my second unit,"I installed this unit in 1993. Never had a problem until about a month ago...it just didn't work until I flipped the switch three or four times. So, I've ordered another, and maybe it will last another twenty years."
1,Wish it could grind itself into little pieces...,"Unit installed by the builder. Less than 5 years old and leaking from case, just like the others. Lived in previous home over 10 years, never had a problem with the unit that came with it (which may have been 15 yrs old already!). Purchasing a Waste-King because of the high number of great reviews."
3,Won't last,"Hey, I am reviewer 75, so I am sure some other people will say the same thing. We put in a new one about every four years. These don't last. Sure the motor holds up, and sure, it gets noisier with age, but the guts rust out and the seal goes out first. I love water leaks near electricity, but maybe it's just me... . Be sure to read the instructions at least a little.Any other brand to buy? This is made by Emerson, who makes most of them out there. Good luck finding a good one."
3,New disposer,"Very pleased with product. I replace an old, worn out unit with this new unit of the same model number. It went back in with no problums nor plumbing changes required and works as it should. Maybe not the strongest unit available but suitable for our needs and the price was right."
4,Does what it's suppose to do,I had my original waste disposal go out on me and Amazon had this for a lot less than Home Depot. Installation isn't too bad with a little know how (used the power cord from original disposal for this one since it was not included)...that's if you have a disposal already installed. Make sure to unplug the dishwasher drain port. I did not know there is a existing plug built in and I ended up having back wash from the aerator when the dishwasher tried to drain into the disposal unit. Anyway it works fine...nothing fancy like the more expensive and quieter models. No problems as of yet!
3,Lasted 7 Years,"Bought this unit new from Lowes and installed it myself. The install was easy but after 7 years of use I now have to uninstall the unit. I noticed a water leak under my sink and traced it back to the garbage disposal.It was leaking out the bottom through the electrical area. The disposal is loud and has clogged up only a couple of times. Overall maybe a good unit or maybe I just got lucky based on all of the other reviews, but I am going to replace it with a Kenmore unit. For the price I paid I'll give it 3 stars."
5,Perfect fit. Took me all of 15 minutes to switch out the old one.,"I bought this unit to replace a 10-year old Badger 5 disposer that finally stopped working. I have never replaced one before and was a little worried....but it only took me all of 15 minutes to switch it out, using very basic tools. It's amazing that in 10 years, the new model is easily switched out with the old unit. I only noticed one small change with the outlet pipe connection, but the rest were identical. Glad I bought the same unit. I forgot how powerful this one is, and glad I didn't try to upgrade to a 3/4 hp unit."
5,Great Find,"Got this installed to replace an existing InSinkErator disposer. The change out was reasonably smooth. Instructions have some faults (whose don't anymore), but nothing too serious. The unit itself performed great. It is a move up from its predecessor (1/3 to 1/2HP), but this unit is quieter and seems to get stuff ground up much more quickly.Shipping from Amazon was quick, easy & painless."
2,InSinkErator short life,"I am replacing a 1/2 hp home kitchen InSinkErator after 2-1/2 years due to water leaking from the electrical cord entry on bottom of unit. As an electrician I don't like water getting inside the motor compartment. Upon inspection of the grinding chamber I see a hole approx. 1/4"" dia. in the composite material. Practically all brands work well at first, but if they don't last I don't like. Notice other leak problems in customer reviews. Be careful!"
4,Badger 5-easy to install,"I purchased the Badger 5 to replace a Badger 5.5 (which is no longer available) after it froze up repeatedly. (Don't ask, I tried everything!) Although under-the-sink repairs can be frustrating because the space is tight, this wasn't too bad. I did quite a bit of research and watched a couple of tutorials before starting, which certainly helped. Understanding how the old device turned to detach and then lifting (and holding up) the new one were actually the hardest parts. You need to find something just the right height to help hold the new Badger while you get it positioned. I also used the old electrical cord and reattached it to the new base, otherwise you need to buy the cord separately. I am a female who actually likes doing construction and home repairs, and it took me about two hours."
5,Very pleased,"Wonderful product, no problems with unit, easy installation, does what it should do grind up food. I would recommend this to a friend"
5,InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP,"Other than the pain of taking out an old disposal and laying on ones back, the Badger was easy to install, sealed very well and seems to be a solid product. We don't use one every day so this model seemed like a correct fit for our environment. I wish it were quieter, but again, we don't use too often so it really doesn't bother us that much."
5,Works great and easy to install!!,I had my previous InSinkErator Badger 5 for 8 years and it finally quit working. I read the reviews from other purchasers but my experience has been nothing but good. The disposal was easy to install because I had already put in the sink collar with my previous purchase. I took out the old one and had the new one installed in a 1/2 hour. It's relatively quiet and does its job well. I would not hesitate to buy this brand and model again.
1,No cord,Why would they not install a cord so that it can be plugged in without a hassle? I guess the answer is they are just cheap. The want to show a lower price than GE or Whirlpool so they leave parts off.
1,Broke in about 4 months - literally in 2,Our badger 5 literally broke in two this afternoon. the plastic just literally broke. and the disposer broke into two pieces. never had that happen before. we bought it 4 months ago.
1,Plastic housing cracked after three years,"I like others, noticed a leak under the sink. When i inspected, I noticed the housing had two cracks letting liquid drip out when in use.Very cheap quality. Customer service is useless.Beware."
2,3 years and out,"I've had this unit for about 3 years and it developed a leak in the bottom. Sure enough, reading reviews from here pointed me to a housing leak, just after the warranty expired. I'm single and don't need to use it much, but I think a garbage disposal should last more than 3 years. I'm gonna buy something different this time."
4,Replace a Badger with a Badger,"I was satisified with the Badger 5 by Insinkerator, so I ordered an exact replacement. The old one was still working whereas the motor was good but the case just wore out. Busted right thru the aluminum side wall. I don't know how long it was in service as it was in the house when I bought it 10 years ago. Total rust out of the steel case teeth exposed the aluminum to the direct blast of the ground up material. I put ice cubes into the unit occationally to clean things up and give it a little work out, until one day...The cubes came out the side of case.Another thing I did which I do not recomend now was to put orange peels into the unit and grind them partially, leaving the remains in the unit beause it smelled nice and I felt it was sanitizing things. Don't do this. The acids left are probably what caused so much rust.I don't think you can by a better brand and I am satisfied."
4,Used Bager for years.,Overall they have a good product. Only got one bad one after about 10. Sent it back and they replaced no problem.
2,Badger5,My first badger 5 lasted 12 years. Its replacement lasted 4 years and started leaking thru the housing. So much for badger5. I just ordered a Waste King with an unlimited warranty as my next replacement for about $45 more.
3,"I got five years out of mine, 3 years longer than my badger 10","Spend a little more and get a better disposer. I got five years out of mine and then the cast iron grinding chamber collapsed. Since I only got 2 years out of the replacement badger 10, I consider myself lucky. My latest disposer is a Waste King. Bye bye Badgers...."
3,great garbage disposer,"Easy to install,especially as a replacement and works fine. The only beef I have is they don't give you wire nuts so you have to re-use your old ones or go running out to buy a new pair. I think that's a little petty. And if I were performing a new installation it would have made me really angry."
1,Unreliable,"I owned a Badger I for 28 years and 11 months. It was a very dependable product for that time. After it finally quit, I replaced it with a Badger 5. After 2 1/2 years, the Badger 5 simply quit working. The reset button does not help. Based on the other reviews and my own experience, I will try another brand."
4,Serves its purpose,This is a like for like replacement. This came new and in good working order. It does what it is supposed to do. :)
1,Yikes!,Buyer beware. The InSinkErator Badger disposal that was in the house at the purchase time is leaking from the reset button. I certainly will not replace it with a Badger product. I gave it one star because there was not a zero star option.
3,Badger 5,"I replaced my neighbors Badger 5--7 years of very limited service--when it began to leak from the bottom.With that, my rating reflects the the product itself. I have the same unit and anticipate it going bad soon.I would think that a garbage disposal would last longer.I have to rate Amazon pricing and delivery excellent---5 stars---got the unit for $30 less than Home Depotand it delivered in about 4 days."
2,Buy JB Weld with this product or DON'T BUY IT,"I operate a vacation rental property management business. We have about 20 of these in various cabins. About 13 of 20 of these Badger 5 disposals have cracked requiring them to be repaired. While the repair has been fairly easy (thick layer of JB Weld), it is annoying to our renters and should NOT be necessary! I am waiting for Badger to recall this item so we can send them all back!"
4,So far so good!,"I bought this garburator for the replacement of Badger 1. Everything is fine so far. The only concern is that the cable connector and wire nuts are not included, so you have to spend almost $10 to buy these accessories."
5,Replace the same product I used for 12 years,Very good and reliable product!It replaced the same product I used for 12 yrs. Very powerful and lower noice. Very easy install!
1,Advise against - Disposal leaking from bottom of unit near reset switch,Today I opened the kitchen cabinet and noticed water dripping from the bottom of this garbage disposal. A quick internet search shows many customers with this same problem. The unit is not customer repairable but must be replaced. The leak damaged the cabinet and dripped into the basement. I will not purchase this brand again.
2,Replacing,"I just bought my first house and the garbage disposal gave up. Looking under the kitchen sink, you can see where it had been leaking out the side and bottom due to all the crusty stains everywhere. Looking up the serial number tells me that it is only 4 years old."
1,Cracked,"I was pretty happy with the disposal at first but after less than six months of barely ever being used, the unit cracked open. I didn't notice the crack at first which resulted in a water fall through the cabinet into the basement. Seems to be a theme with this brand."
1,Another housing crack and leak,"Badger 5 installed in new home less than three years ago. Four inch crack on side. It is above where our trash can touches the unit, so I conclude this is another faulty unit. I will not replace with another Badger model (same customer service experience: ""Oh, sorry. Out of warranty. You may buy another one."" Very poor response and quality."
1,Poor quality,"This ubnit came with our how (new construction). After three months of use, the motor burnt out and it was under warrenty and replaced. Now, 2.5 years after the replacement, i found that the body of the unit has a crack running almost the the entire length of the body. It's not like a disposal has a lot of water pressure pushing out of it. Based on the number of similar complaints and my own persoanl experience with this disposal, it appears that this is a device that was constructed poorly and I would avoid the unit all together."
3,Possible defect?,I installed my Badger 5 two years ago. I'm a single homeowner so it was used lightly. After grinding some onion scraps I noticed a leak under the sink. After careful inspection I noticed the disposal developed a crack in the housing unit. A quick call to InSinkErator revealed the unit was still under warrantee. I had a repair person out the following day who replaced the entire disposal with a Badger 5XP (he said they've stopped making the Badger 5). The problem was resolved quickly and to my satisfaction. My only concern with this unit is how or why it developed the crack with such light usage.
1,Poor quality,"We have just had our 3 year old unit fail completely in the same way Paul did.The plastic housing is cracking. Of course this is not something that can be fixed by replacing a washer or something simple.When I phoned their customer service, I was told that as it was out of the 2 year warranty, they were not interested. While I can understand this for minor problems, it is pretty bad when the unit is completely worthless such a small time after installation.Emerson products might have been good 20 years ago, but they sure aren't now.Unless you like doing plumbing repairs, steer clear."
1,Another Cracked Housing,"Here's another one for the list of cracked housings on the Badger 5 model. The unit is only about 4 years old and started leaking from the bottom of the unit. Service had me run through the usual and never told me that this was a common problem with this model. I would not buy another insinkerator model at this point, there are too many other good products on the market. The replacement model for the Badger 5 is the Badger 5 XP if anyone is interested."
1,Very poor for grinding food.,"Installation is straight forward and the quality of the materials is very good. The problem is their idea of impellers or blades. There are just 2 moving parts that grind things up and they more or less bash the food into smaller pieces. If you put anything small such as the ends of a carrot or an apple core, the initial bashing works, but very shortly the remains of the food spin to the outer edged beyond the reach of the impellers and it just stays there. Turning the unit on and off and on and off 5-6 times will eventually work but this is not even close to the quality of grinding I saw on much older models. They could have solved this problem with the simple addition of another impeller (cost about 78 cents) but as it is you will be cleaning out bits of food a lot.UPDATE: They seem to have cut the warranty in half since mine was purchased just a few months ago. Not a good sign."
1,Clogs all the time with Potato or Carrot peels,"Stay away from this brand. I have had it for 2 years, and for the last year it has clogged every time I try to put potato or carrot peels down the disposal unit."
1,Dispose of this garbage- what a waste!,"My brand new home came with a brand new Badger 5 disposal unit. Within 3 years, the housing cracked (a common problem with these units) and sprung a leak. This is something that cannot be repaired. When I called customer service, I was informed that this one is out of warranty, so too bad, so sad ... go buy a new one (great marketing huh?) ... so I will, but not one of theirs."
2,Failed at 5 years,I replaced a Waste King unit with the Badger 5 about 5 years ago. Unfortunately Home Depot didn't have anything else that was affordable. This unit has never performed as well as the Waste King did. It took a long time to grind food completely. The last year or so it has clogged often. The motor gave up this week and will only hum.
2,leaking,"Well I am going to attempt a new replacement Badger I guess, like everyone else my badger is leaking from the bottom and I dont want to go through the hassle of refittinng all the pipes! got about 5 years out of it.Had a different model at my old home when I sold the house after 11 years that was still going strong!"
3,Died after 6 years of low usage,"Bought this unit(InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP Food Waste Disposer) in 2005 and has started to leak at the bottom of the housing unit. The motor is still running but basically, the cabinet under the sink got soaking wet!The unit had only a 2-year warranty. Its just not worth it to hire a plumber and have this unit opened, re-sealed etc unless you are handy. Much cheaper to buy another unit.I give it 3 stars since it did last for 6yrs but seriously, given the low usage(once every other week for less than a minute), I would have expected this to last longer for 10 to 20 years.Will be considering another brand to replace the InSinkErator, one that has a longer warranty."
4,In Sink Erator Badger 5 garbage disposal,"I bought this as a replacement for an existing Badger 5 that was about 20 years old and was making a terrible racket. The new unit works great. The only problem I had was that the discharge plumbing was inexplicably different from the old unit -- it tucked close down the side of the disposal, rather than sticking straight out for a few inches and then bending down. That meant a trip to the hardware store to buy a couple of elbows and pipes. The dishwasher plug was quite difficult to pound out, but eventually came out with no problem. Other than those items, the new unit went right in in place of the old one."
2,The 5xp is not so great,Installed the Badger 5xp in 07. Now with warranty expired (3 years)it is leaking from bottom. From other reviews it seems that product quality is not the main concern of manufacturer. Like so many products these days. Will look at other companies to see their ratings
2,Another Crack,Mine too has cracked on the side. It is also leaking out of the bottom through the motor. Its only a few years old.
5,Great Value for the Money,"This product arrived quickly and was packed well. I am not exactly Mr. Handyman, but the instructions were extremely easy to follow, and I was able to install it without my father's help. It runs great. Haven't had any problems with it at all. Great product for the money spent!!"
2,There is a reason there's a 2 year warranty,"I have bought many Insinkerators and for the simple reason is they usually don't last past their warranties. The last one I purchased lasted beyond the 2-year warranty. The only reason I haven't purchased another brand is because I don't have to reinstall the part that hooks up to the sink. That takes time and effort. So I just attach the new badger in the old slot.My other experience is they run very well until the warranty ends. It doesn't fine chop the particles going into the disposer and the pipe gets clogged up, and the sink gets stopped up!I gave it a two star because again I keep having to replace the unit just after the warranty expires. It's okay up until then. Why can't they make these things to last well beyond the warranty?"
5,little badger eats everything givinen to it,"works great , quick install . took off old one . done less then ten minutes"
2,"Badger 5, Another One Bites the Dust","We have just moved into a 6 year old house and the Badger 5 garbage disposal has a nuisance leak. The leak is most evident when emptying a basin of water, which then fills the disposal. Of course, the house inspection didn't pick this up and it is out of warranty! There is a vertical crack the full length of the housing between the conical transition and the motor canopy. Reading other reviews, this is more than wear and tear and should be considered a design flaw. This disposal is also relatively noisy. We would not purchase this disposal again. However, we did replace it with another Badger product, an Evolution Series Space Saver. It is a completely different construction and design and comes with a four (4) year warranty. It is as quiet as a church mouse and was easy to install on the existing spin-on mounting. Although the cost is about double it will be well worth it!!"
4,Replacement for the 1/3 HP model,I used this to replace a 1/3 HP disposal that had a cracked body. It grinds pretty well and installed easily since it was a replacement for the same brand.
2,Beware of missing parts,I was replacing a unit that was 9 years old. This unit does NOT come with a power cord or the rubber gasket needed to mount the unit to the upper mount. I had to reuse both parts from the old unit. Not happy with this. The box had no instructions in it and the instructions online are very poor. The unit did work once I mounted it. It seams to be quieter than the old one. Just be prepared to buy extra parts when buying this unit.
1,Piece of junk,"Our Badger 5 is 4 1/2 years old and was installed by builder in our new home. It has now developed a leak and we just noticed heavy rust on the entire 3 bolt housing. Haven't determined cause of leak, but have ordered a Waste King L-8000 from Amazon and can't wait to replace this unit. Unit is noisy and under the best of circumstances, takes forever to dispose of food."
1,Don't waste your money on this waste,Lasted a whopping 5 years under light usage. Leaks and rusts. I had a Kitchen Aid last 12 years before we wrecked it by putting something bad in it. I've read this is a common problem w/these units but no help from the company. I believe this is a manufacturing defect.
5,Insinkerator Badger disposal,"I had to replace a disposal for my kitchen sink and found this one at Amazon. It is the same make/model as what I had. It was an easy install since it had the same connections and mounting as the one it was replacing, which had lasted us over 20 years. It is a very efficient and quiet model and does the job well. It is an easy install even if the one you're replacing has a different mounting and you have to do all of it yourself. I look forward to having this unit serve me for years, without trouble, just as it's predecessor did."
1,Waste of money. Housing cracked,I am on my second disposal 5 years. In both cases the housing has developed a hairline cracked which leaked into the cabinet of my brand new house sink base. I will not be purchasing another.
1,Failed after less than years...,"My 1/2 horse Badger 5 disposal failed prematurely. It had a 1 year warranty and was about 2 years old. Very disappointing...We don't do any heavy duty grinding. (No bones, never got a spoon or anything else stuck...) The repair guy says he sees a lot of premature leaks since they went to a lightweight plastic mount.I'm going to let the repair guy put a new Badger in because he has one in stock, but this will be my last Insinkerator Badger. When we get the new kitchen counter tops and sink, I am going to go with a better one!"
1,"Me, too.",Was replaced twice under warranty. Now it's out of warranty and it just flooded the kitchen. I'll be replacing it with another brand.
1,Garbage(no pun intended),"These Badger disposals are absolute junk. I bought this exact model in February of 2009 to replace the one that came with my condo(condo was 14 years old, not sure about the disposal). After 2 years and 1 month, the housing got a crack and now leaks. I will NOT buy anOther one of these pieces of garbage, especially after seeing how many others have had the same problem. Read your reviews and fix your product badger!"
2,"It works okay, until it dies","This is the slightly older model of Badger 5 garbage disposal. Ours was OK, not great, until it died. It would jam on occasion, but it would sometimes bog down on as little as a cup of vegetable peels or onion skins. It was easy enough to clear and reset (with a 1/4"" Allen wrench or hex key), until one morning, it just stopped. It continued to make a buzzing noise, which usually means it can be reset, but not this time.Apparently, the newer model is even worse than the one we have. I would suggest a KitchenAid or Waste King, which is what we went with..."
5,InSinkErator,"We had this same product put in when we first built the house almost 19 years ago. So, when it broke down on us, we just ordered it again. Of course, it had been modified a wee bit and it is working just great."
1,"Bad Badger, Bad Insinkerator","Insinkerator used to be ""the name"" is garbage disposals. Now, its just a piece of garbage. Shortly after the warranty expires, so will your Badger 5, but not before dripping water, food goo and gunk under your sink. After reading all these bad reviews, are you really gonna buy this hunk of junk?"
2,Break by itself,"This is designed to rust from inside out within a few years; so if you never use it, it would still break by itself. Apparently the design is to create interior rust-prone spots all around the top part of the unit. These spots eventually rust out and create a split all around, and if you wait long enough the whole unit would fall off. Meanwhile the rusted-out holes would leak water everywhere."
5,InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP Food Waste Disposer,"This was a direct replacement for the one in my house that started leaking. With that said, installation took all of 10 minutes. I was able to use the old mounts and just simply wire up the new one and twist it on. It works great, and doesn't leak. Job Done."
2,Won't last long,"I've had this unit a little over 2 years (just long enough to be outside the 2-year warranty) and the casing is cracked and leaking. I didn't notice the leak until the water started dripping into my basement. Ugh. You're better off buying a Waste King, rated #1 by Consumer Reports and only slightly higher priced than the Badgers."
3,all steel would be better,"The reason for my purchase was to replace my old badger which had cracked. The plastic housing cracked and leaked water. Problably from a piece of metal that accidently got into the disposer. I feel like if the housing were made of steel, it would not have cracked."
1,Cracked casing caused leak - time for a Waste King,"Not sure how old our Badger 5 is since it was already in the house when we moved in 2 years ago. After realizing the leak under the sink was coming from the disposal, we began the hunt for a new disposal. I'm so glad I came across these reviews before replacing with another faulty Badger. We'll go with the Waste King this time around."
2,Owned for 3 years.,"I've had this garbage disposal for the past three years. It's not very poweful and I don't even try to put much down it. Also, it has completely broken down twice in the past three years. I would save up next time to buy a better model. My husband always says you get what you pay for."
5,got this installed by plumber,IT WORKS WELL HOPE IT WILL HOLD UP AND THAT I GET MY MONEY WORTH. IT TOOK A PROFESSIONAL A WHILE TO GET THE OLD DISPOSAL OUT AND THE NEW ONE IN
3,InSinkErator Badge 1/2 hp,"Installation would have been much faster if it came with the power cord, had to use the old one. So far no problems."
3,Garbage Disposal,Not as powerful as I expected. I had a 3/4 HP unit before and it was too powerful and noisy. This one is Quieter but not NEAR as powerful. I feel tha I don't even have a 1/3 HP unit. Won't even grind up chicken bones.
1,Bad Badgers,Easy enough to install but didn't last long. Unit is about 3 or 4 years old and the motor has gone out and it must be replaced again. Probably all imported crap from China like everything else.
5,Badger 5 Garbage Disposal,My Badger 5 garbage disposal froze up on me today after 19 1/2 years without any problems. I ordered another one today for the quality of the previous one and easy replacement with the same model. Some nice features are the electrical reset button on the bottom of the unit and the allen wrench fitting so you may turn the disposal if you get something lodged in it to free it up.
4,Good low cost option,"If you are replacing an existing in-sink-erator brand, the install lakes 20 minutes. Remove the old one. Pop out the dishwasher drain plug, move the power cord from your old model to the new one, install the new one with a simple twist, connect dishwasher drain and primary disposal drain into existing sink plumbing. Was a snap. This is a cheaper/low cost model, and it is not super quiet. We replaced a higher end model that died, and can tell this is a bit louder... but we don't use it very often so we didn't care."
1,Steaming heap,"I've gone through two Instinkerator Badger 5 disposals in six years. First one leaked, and the second on just burnt up. It's a shame, too - I had high hopes for this American made product."
3,Fairly easy to install,This was the second garbage disposal I purchased to replace the original insinkerator that I had for over ten years. I returned a waste king garbage diposal and I am happy that I decided to go purchase an insinkerator instead. It was fairly easy to follow the instructions and install. I put the badger together by myself and this was only my second time installing a garbade disposal.
4,InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP Food Waste Disposer,I like it because it is working fine after installation. A couple of weeks gone and I did not have any problem. The reason behind not giving 5 is I did not get the fiber gasket that is supposed to come with the package. I had to go to the home improvement store to get one.
2,At least I made it to 5 years!,"Like everybody else, the plastic housing on my Badger 5 cracked and it started leaking water. Having seen run-of-the-mill garbage disposals last 10-20 years, this was extremely disappointing. The only reason it's getting 2 stars rather than 1 is because it seems we got lucky by getting 5 years compared to most other reviewers getting just over 2 years."
4,Disposal,"This was easy to install. I had the exact sameone, so that may have helped. The old one worked finefor over 16 years and would still be working but I messed itup myself. No fault of the dispoal"
5,Great garbage disposer,This is a great product. It was easy to install and we got it in a timely fashion. I would recommend it to anyone.
2,Leaks From Housing,"I bought the unit from Home Depot probably 3 years ago and it did work OK. But like the others, this unit will fail shortly after warranty and leak water (very stinky water I might add). I would not purchase this unit, obviously poor construction and design. It takes too much effort to replace disposals every few years. AVOID this product!"
3,no power cord,Product did not come with a power cord... so must have electrician wire one... not good...same product at H/Depot has cord ... so cost will turn out more expensive.
5,Piece of Cake to Install,"My old Badger 1 broke down; the metal bit that ""threw"" the food on the top plate came loose. Per badger support, it was a single piece so couldn't be fixed.Purchased the Badger 5 and it installed easily on the former mounting. Took less than an hour; biggest problem was just dealing with the existing water in the drain (yuck; make sure you have a bucket underneath).Have been using it for a couple months now and it works great. Based on the price of the 5 vs. the 1 on Amazon, it's well worth the upgrade for the extra horsepower. It is only a pound or so heavier."
4,Good Waste Disposer,"I had one of these waste disposers in place for many years, worked great. Install was easy beings the same brand was in before. Shipping could have been a bit faster. Overall very satisfied."
3,Am I asking too much!!,"My first disposer was a GE and lasted for 30 years. I replaced it with my first Badger 5 1/2 hp, which worked great for 9 years. It started leaking through the bottom and tripping the breaker. My new Badger 5 I installed an 12-26-10. So far so good. I'm hoping get more that 15 years from it since I don't use it that often and my first one lasted 30 years. Am I asking too much?"
2,Leaked after 5 months.....,"I bought this and hardly used the insinkerator (about once per week). After 4 months, it started to leak at the bottom in several areas. The bottom is made of steel metal. The water caused the corrosion which shows the design flaw of this product. It is strong enough to move and tear food particles but it leaks a significant amount of water. This product is not good...stay away from all the Badgers."
4,"More is less, a great bio in a small book","This book gives the reader a great outline of O'Keeffe's life. Best of all, the author matches the artist's personal development with her work so that one can travel in O'Keeffe's footsteps and appreciate both her outlook and inner eye."
5,One stop shopping,"I used this tool once on a set-up an was blown away at the user friendly tools that are in the Farley's J G Tool. I used every tool except the pin prying tool. The F J Guitar tool is a must in my tool box. In fact, I will be ordering another pair for my general tool box that I use for small handyman jobs around the house. Great Tool."
4,READ THIS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ECONOMICS!,"Paul Zane Pilser did a great job of explaining the theory of Alchemy and the application of it in Supply-side and Demand-side economics can produce an unlimited amount of resources and wealth for an economy. He also does a great job of discussing technology and how it is is extremely important to economic growth, how it can greatly conserve resources, it's infinite possiblities, and much more.I learned a lot from this book!"
4,Thought Provoking,"Paul is right on. In 1990 he articulated the impact that technology has on our resources. We do not live in a world of scarce resources. We use technology to replace them, or multiply them, and discover new resources all the time. Paul's message to me: This world has plenty of what mankind needs. We can invent our way out of any perceived shortage. Read this book to think about all this in some new ways."
1,Whatever Happened to AT&T Quality?,"After two days the color display failed. The display looked like an old film with vertical lines and no color.The inability to share phone books also was a BIG drawback. I think I would have tolerated that, if the display did not fail. For the price, I expect quality and features. Not getting quality, is unacceptable at this price range. I learned that AT&T; really don't make these phones, VTech does.The Handset on this and the base unit E5965C do not fit the face well.Consumer Reports rated these phones high, but after using them for a week, I was really disappointed and returned the set for a refund.I am now considering the Panasonic KX-TG5776S."
3,Nice sound but I don't expect longevity,"Nice sound characteristics, I have 3 handsets and within the first month I had to exchange two of them. One of the number buttons stopped working on one and the other just stopped working. The batteries also last too short a time before needing charging, I may buy a stronger non AT&T battery to try to solve that problem. Though the sound quality is good, the sound quality on the answering machine is poor in hindsight, I wouldn't buy this phone again."
3,AT&T phones,"One of the two phones worked perfectly, and one failed after three weeks, and I had to get replacement batteries."
3,Bought new/ was shipped refurbished,"We bought this handset at the same time as the base with answering system. Our choice was based on consumer reports. When we received the extra handset, it already had preset numbers in the memory. It was a refurbished phone that we bought ""New"". We have not been able to locate a customer service number to complain. The only difficulty with this phone so far is; you have to manually enter all the speed dial phone numbers in again. They do not transfer from one handset to another. It is very laborious."
1,Brand New & Not Working,"The handsets (two of them) I purchased would not charge. Apparently the batteries were faulty. I did read this in other reviews as a problem, but wrongly I assumed it was just a fluke. AT&T seems to have a quality control problem. I sent them back and purchased a Motorola product which has worked wonderfully from the start. I do not recommend the AT& T handsets nor the base phone that goes with it. The base phone I ordered had a different model number on the phone itself than was on the outside box. The inside model number was not the one I ordered. Again, quality control problems."
5,Enlightening and Uplifting,Mikasenoja has done a marvelous job of relating true to life experience in captivating story form. This book gives an inside look at the position and perils that a pastor's wife faces. It offers pearls of encouragement and wisdom along the way for both pulpit and pew members. Great book!
5,Every Christian woman should read this,"This books is absolutely amazing and very insightful into the private (or, rather, not so private) life of a pastor's wife. All women can learn from Jackie's faith and her choice to look for positive ways to air her frustrations through prayer and journaling. Christian women should read this to gain insight into the thoughts and feelings of a pastor's wife and lift her up in prayer. Pastor's wives can relate to Jackie's doubts, insecurities, and feelings of isolation and I feel that much can be gleaned from her wisdom, even if she is a fictional character. Wonderful book."
2,I must be missing something ...,"While the storyline is commendable, the story itself is boring and tedious. I don't consider myself a literary snob, however, I guess I can't get past the poor editing to truly enjoy the story."
3,The Power of Prayer,"A insightful book about the issues a first lady faces. I was very please on how she handled her issues through prayer and jounaling. It also open my eyes to a lot of issues I was unaware of that a first lady faces. Which I now know I need to constantly be interceding for my first lady and her family for the challenges and obsticles they face. This book also had me exmaine myself as a mother, wife and sister in the Lord on how to handle my own challenges."
4,king kong has charm but just not long enough,"the title explains it. The game is brilliant, and I loved it a lot. It was so awesome to play it, I was dissapointed when it ended. It was fun to play and I wanted to play it much much more. you can play as kong, which is awesome! and also you get to play a FPS as Adrian brodys character. I just wish it was longer."
4,Knig Kong PS2,"This game is a very enjoyable shooter, and it follows the Peter Jackson movie very faithfully. But be aware, it is a somewhat dark and scary adventure for younger gamers, and it won't run on later versions of PS3s. I'm told that the older model PS3s are backwards compatible with it, but mine was not, so I had to play it on a PS2 :("
3,Insinkerator warranty - Keep your receipt,"According to my date of purchase I had still 2 months warranty left when the drive shaft sheared at the shredder rotor mounting. Could not produce the receipt and based on the date of manufacture obtained from the serial number it was 3 months out of warranty.The model 777ss has 7-year in-home service warranty.The warranty is determined by purchase or installation receipt date which is subject to verification by InSinkErator or their authorized representative.If the disposer was installed as part of a newly constructed home, and you are the first occupant, the warranty start date would be based upon the occupancy date with supporting documentation.If no receipt/documentation is available, the warranty then reverts back to the date of manufacture obtained from the serial number.If the disposer has been replaced by an InSinkErator authorized service agency under warranty, the replacement unit would carry the balance of the original warranty."
1,Zero communication from Seller,"I ordered two of these chairs May 19th 2007. Today is the 29th and I have had to date no confirmation (email, phone call) from WillyGoat. Awful."
3,"Great Coffee, Just Received ""Old"" Bags!","I purchased a case and received it fast. The only problem was that each bag has a expiration date of 1002 and the current date is 1108? Wow! Great coffee, but just not a great coffee buying experience."
3,Color off,"This is not white as pictured. More of a beige color. Works perfectly fine, just a male to male coax mounted on a plate."
4,Good,"This movie was pretty good. The two main characters, Aimee and Tran, are best friends. They are both in high school. She is a recent immigrant from South Korea. Tran is more Americanized. They speak to one another in Korean because she's still learning to master English. I like how they spend a lot of time together just ""hanging out."" Like many teenagers ""hanging out,"" they don't do much of anything- they talk, they watch tv, play video games, go to parties, etc. He seems to want to be more than a friend. Aimee definitely has a crush on Tran. Neither is able to express what they are feeling so there is a lot of undertone between them. It is a character movie that most Americans would not have the patience to watch. I thought it was very well done and I loved the acting. However, I wasn't too thrilled with the vague ending."
3,Between many places,"While adolescence is never idyllic and of necessity is a painful and confusing process, Aimee's experience seems bleaker than most. Between cultures, parents, friends, girlhood and adulthood, Aimee drudges through her days trying to find herself and a place to settle. The pace, music and colors highlight the inner landscape of each of the characters, none of whom seem to hold much hope for a better future. From an artistic/technical perspective, there may be a great deal to recommend it but not a movie to savor or enjoy."
2,poor customer service,had problems with winch working. called for help to get a manual and was told only a middle man couldn't help. with combining parts from an old winch and this one finally got it to work.
5,Unconditional love,"Ryan Willis has put together a wonderful collection of photos and stories in this book. I was particularly touched by the stories of people who adopted their dogs from shelters, since I too recently found my best friend at a city rescue organization. It is nice to see that in the age of name brands equaling quality, when it comes to their dogs most people still recognize that breeds are not important--love is. I urge anyone who is touched by this book to check out their local animal shelters and rescue organizations today!!"
4,Cruisy!,"This album's mood is described as ""Rhythm, blues and barbecue"", which is entirely apt. Put this on when you have your next BBQ and the sausages will cook perfectly to this tight, professional musicianship. Very nice indeed!"
3,Agnes Browne,"Agnes Browne is about a single mother of seven children in Dublin, Ireland and their life struggles. When I first read the book, I didn't expect anything from it. It wasn't truly a bad book, so it is something for other readers to give a try. This book can be anything to the reader, whether it be hilarious to downright heartwarming."
1,Beware - same as The Mammy!,"Buyer Beware! The publisher has renamed the original book in this wonderful series. If you buy or own ""The Mammy"", you do not need this book!"
3,"Not a true ""best of""","David Wilcox is an unbelievable musician, and while this album has a collection of good songs, it is not truly a the very best of. This album shows a good representation of his work up to that point, but they leave out a handful of excellent tunes. The idea is obviously to sell this album and by doing so provoke the customer to buy the other albums as well. For seasoned Wilcox fans they will find this album filled with some but not all of his hits; and for beginning fans this would be a bad choice for a first buy. I would recommend ""Live Songs & Stories"". This album does have good songs, but your money would be better spent on one of his traditional albums."
2,Not worth it,"I am a big David Wilcox fan, and I would buy a CD of him singing in the shower, so I probably would have bought this CD anyway. However, if you are a fan you already have all this stuff. This is a (rather incomplete) compilation of his career at A&M Records. It includes ""Eye of the Hurricane"" and ""Rusty Old American Dream"", but leaves out ""Show the Way"" and ""Someday Soon"". I don't know who chose the songs, but you are better of with any one of his A&M releases than this soulless and disjointed production. Seeing as how there are no quotes from David himself from after 1991, I suspect he had nothing to do with the release himself."
5,What a Talent,"David Wilcox has got to be one of the best singer songwriters of our current age. He is a such a poet. We need another ""Best Of"" volume.The Mary Chapin Carpenter Collection"
3,Great Guitar,"I bought a couple of David Wilcox CDs. He is a great guitarist and I am partial to this type of folk acoustic stuff. It only takes a short while for me to become kind of bored with the lyrics and compositions however. It seems that there are not any real highs and lows and the mood of the tracks never change. He is too good a guitarist to say that he is mediocre, but there is nothing here that excites me."
1,NOT deserve the money,"the pen I received does not like a brand-new pen, it had some light scratches and was not as shinning as I expected. also, the upper part and the lower part of the pen do not connect tightly, I have to push them to eliminate the gap.While these are still acceptable as least it is branded as a cross pen. But after the 10th month I owned this pen (From Oct 5, 2009 to Aug 28, 2010), I really question if this is a REAL cross pen. The small top cap right above the text 'CROSS' just dropped off from the pen, luckily it happened in my home so I can find it anyway.I have more than 5 cross pens for daily usage, and this one has not been used very often from day one. how come the structure of this pen is so fragile!! Is this a REAL cross pen?????Bottom line: do NOT deserves the money!!!!!"
3,"Nice product, If only it were the one that I originally ordered","Ordered the 18K pen from Amazon for $100.00. Got an email from the seller informing me that the 18k was out of stock and that the substitute would be the 14K pen...For the same price. I failed to see how that made sense at the time that It happened.With that being said, The dealer DID have good communication and the Cross pens are always quality as to be expected."
3,truth or fiction?,"I can't help but wonder how much of Davenport's description of island pollution and abuse by the military is actually the truth. Living in Hawaii for several years and visiting for many years before, I have never, ever read in any publication of cancer-causing substances on Oahu or any other island."
4,"Great Product, Awesome Amazon","Great product for the price. I put this on my 1996 C1500 Suburban and it is working great. Great sound and flow, but doesn't affect rider comfort at all, even in the third row. Improved throttle response. My only knock on it that the hanging brackets could be a little better by adding a slight angle at the end. Another thought: I'm thinking of having this welded, not required but it would only be in 3 spots and would increase its durability. Amazon had the best price and shipping. I live in Hawaii and it was way cheaper to purchase at Amazon then on the economy, add in free shipping at it's even better!"
3,Not entirely suitable for Elementary kids,I was looking for a DVD to help augment a unit on Vivaldi that I was teaching to Grade 4 students. There are some segments that are useable such as dance sequences and a comedic theater piece. Some of the narration is not suitable for younger kids so make sure you view it before you present the DVD.
3,"Not Bad, But They Got Better Than This","Marillion's next step was their masterpiece, ""Misplaced Childhood"". Along with ""Script For A Jester's Tear"" and the earlier ""Market Square Heroes"" EP, this was another stage of growth that got them to greatness. Fish's vocals sound really strained on this one, and the really killer production was not here yet, and the tendency to want to sound like Genesis was still looming, only this time more like the ""Duke"" and ""Abacab"" records than the vintage Gabriel era. Not really a bad album though, ""Assassing"" and ""Punch And Judy"" became big concert favorites along with the title track, but the best was yet to come."
2,The difficult second album,"This is the typical difficult second album from Marillion. It hasn,t quite got the energy of their first album, Script for a Jester's Tear, and lacks the complexity and originality of their third album, Misplaced Childhood. Perhaps Fish and the band were worn out by all the touring that they had been doing. Worth having for completeness but if you have to choose 2 CDs, get the other two."
5,Love it!,"This is my favorite album by the Oak Ridge Boys. All the songs are terrific, but the love ballads are especially beautiful. ""You're The One"" is my favorite. And by the way, it is NOT the same song as the other ""You're The One"" that they have on other albums. This song is so much better. But don't just buy it for that song. Amity, Love Song, American Made, etc. are all great fast-paced tracks and create a nice balance for the slower stuff. They also include a sort of ""power ballad"", I'm So Glad I'm Standing Here Today, which is another great one. They're all good. I'm not a country music expert or even that big of a country music fan, but this is a wonderful album that in my opinion shows the versatility of the group yet still remains ""country""-sounding. You will not be disappointed; you'll find yourself singing the songs in the shower and in the car, and humming them at work. If they added ""Ozark Mountain Jubilee"" to this album, it would be absolutely PERFECT."
5,Joshua is simply amazing,"Last December I saw him playing with the New York Philarmonic, and that has been one of my most unforgettable experience of my life. I have all his records and this is one of my favorites."
5,the essential joshua bell,I really enjoyed the cd it had a variety of all josh's music I especially enjoyed the Gershwin section. I also enjoyed the west side story suite.
5,I thought...,"I think that the soundtrak really went witht the whole movie. There isn't a day that I regret getting it. I would recommend it. I like number 6, 4, 1, 18, 15, 17, 10, and 8!!;-}Jenny"
3,"Great Compilation, Bad to the Scream Trilogy Soundtracks","Ok, the soundtrack itself is very hardcore with some of today's hotest hard-core acts. However, this soundtrack is but a mere compilation produced by Creed of what seems like their favorite songs, rather than being a mixed soundtrack with light and heavy, bright and dark songs that have come from the other Scream Soundtracks. If you like hardcore music be sure and pick it up. However if youre a TRUE Scream fan and have loved the other Soundtracks for what they have represented, then you may be a little disappointed."
4,Come haaaaaaaaaard!,"Well, Amazon nailed it. This is indeed a march of the hard brigade. This CD is a great compilation of hardcore/metal bands, some of them pretty new to the scene, some around for a few years. Slipknot (what disturbs me most about these guys is that they're from IOWA...) gets the blood flowing with ""Wait and Bleed"", Sevendust gets down with ""Fall"", and Powerman takes you back up in the rollercoaster with ""Get On, Get Off"". Coal Chamber does a decent job with ""Tyler's Song"", but lends no credibility to some folks' cracks of them ripping off Korn. Oh well, like the song says, ""They don't give a damn..."" The one downfall on the CD, I think, though, is Static-X's contribution; definitely not their best song, and if you've never heard 'em, you may find yourself saying ""what the hell is this?"" Overall, a great thumping comp, though, definitely a must-listen if you're looking for new hardcore bands."
5,Good quality soundtrack,"This is one of the best soundtracks that I have bought this year and it is defenitely the best scream soundtrack out of all three of them. I love the song ""Wait and Bleed"" by Slipknot, ""What if"" by Creed,""Tylers Song"" by Coal Chamber, and ""Fall"" by Sevendust. Get this soundtrack today."
4,"never saw the movie, but nice music","Although I have never seen Scream 3,I want to and I think the music is cool. Some of the bands I've never really heard of before, like Powerman 5000 or Slipknot or others. I'm giving it 4 stars because all of them aren't the best songs in the world, but still alright.My personal favorite is ""Is This The End"", which is the longest song on here. I've also noticed many horror movie soundtracks have a few of the same bands on here like Bride Of Chucky and Dracula 2000, but they are different songs {naturally}."
1,Something short of the previous two soundtracks,"Although the Scream 3 soundtrack included a few good songs, many of them seemed irrelevant to the movie. Scream and Scream 2 both had excellent soundtracks, although this soundtrack was did not quite impress me as much. It was quite different from the other two."
5,Simply the Best Soundtrack,If you enjoy bands like Slipknot and Creed then this CD is for you. I love this CD and think it's great.
5,Simply Put..........Unbelievable!,"when i first bought this album i really wasnt so sure about too many of the songs on here because honestly i hadn't liked or even heard of some of the bands on here. I wanted it basically for Slipknot's ""Wait and Bleed"" which i had heard on the radio alot, Creed""s ""What If?"" and The Godsmack, Fuel, and Powerman 5000 songs. What i got was a cd with only one really bad song on it, the rest are just pure rock/metal. The only mistake has to be Ear2000 because...........well you get the point! The Best songs here are Finger Eleven's ""Suffocate"", Slipknot ""Wait and Bleed"",Fuel ""Sunburn"", Sevendust ""Fall"", Coal Chamber ""Tyler's Song"" and Static-X ""So Real"". 5 Stars which makes me wish Wes Craven would stop all this bull, make another Scream just for the soundtrack."
5,Huge influence on my musical taste,"As strange as it is, this album influenced me more than any other cd I've ever bought and this is based in large part on timing.I was your typically sheltered, homeschooled, christian child, but as I hit puberty and needed an outlet for my rage, I tried to turn to music. However, my mother wouldn't let me get many of the cds I wanted because of song titles or explicit content stickers.Somehow, this cd slipped past her censorship and thus my exposure to hard rock began. Some might say bad about these bands, or even some of these songs. But I will tell you this, they were a godsend (oh the irony) to a kid just developing, and because I was able to listen to these and release, I and those around me became the better for it.I ended up buying or somehow getting my hands on cds from almost all of these bands, and I still listen to a lot of them to this day.A strange story, I suppose, but true."
4,A New Appreciation,"My boyfriend is a drummer and listens to tons of hard rock stuff - and I never really got into it. Until I heard this CD. I am amazed at the talent that is on this recording, even though I am new to the hard rock scene. I am happy that it is completely clean, and doesnt have offensive lyrics. Now I have a great album to drive around listening to - without having to hear a bunch of horrible lyrics. This is a GREAT album. A must for lovers of new rock."
5,"Unless you were into college radio, you probably missed this one altogether.... in that case, your loss.","Scott Stapp's Wind-Up label got full rights to show off its talent on this album and easily created the best movie soundtrack since The Crow (the original one with Brandon Lee). What you have are rarities by veteran alt-rockers Sevendust, Incubus, and Staind, combined with energetic introductions to newcomers Full Devil Jacket, Dope and Orgy. While two Creed songs seem a little much, ""Is This the End"" is Creed at its most melodic, with Tremonti showing off his crisp note-picking style. ""Click Click"" by Ear2000 is a goof-off piece but somehow catchy once you get past David Arquette's attempt to scream like a rap-metaller (and leaves you wondering about shampoo... I mean, shaaaaaammmmmpooooooooo). I was fortunate enough to be a college DJ on KTRM (in the booming metropolis of Kirksville, Mo) when this hit our playlists, and man it was fun to send out there."
3,Good for a soundtrack,"Even though some tracks are previously released, this soundtrack kind of got me! First of all its Creed, secondly there are bands like : Godsmack, Powerman 5000 and Slipknot.Some songs just simply sucks. When I first bought the soundtrack i was very confused whether to open it or just return it. But then i listened to it and it wasn't that bad.Simply burn it if you can."
