3,"Scratched top, under finish","The table was easy enough to assemble. From a few feet away, it looks great, but up close a scratch under the finished surface on the top is very noticeable. The box wasn't damaged, so I assume the scratch was in the wood on the top before a finish was applied. We didn't try to return the table because of the difficulty of doing that. Better quality control is needed."
4,Good buy.,Except...The screws on the top of the legs are very hard to get to (to tighten them). But since you're only putting together once.
4,Good book for DSP kernal implementation,This book summarizes the major implementation styles of DSP kernels of weighted-sum computations. The authors try to explore the design space of various area-time tradeoffs. Low-power issues & techniques are also discussed in detail. It gives a good review for DSP engineers.
3,Awkward but O.K.,"I've never had a pair of underwear with a ""trophy drawer"" until this pair. They feel awkward at first, but you get used to it."
4,"sexy, smooth and comfy","These are the practical version of the C-IN@ men's bamboo underwear. They're super soft and comfy and have that wonderful trophy shelf that looks so sexy - even if it doesn't add comfort for the wearer. They're also low rise so a guy can wear them with today's low rise jeans without showing off his undies.The bamboo fabric is really soft and supportive, tho a touch transparent."
2,Not impressed.,"The bamboo fabric is just a gimmick, it doesn't provide any benefits over cotton or anything else for that matter. Mine have not held up very well, some of the tiny fibers have come unraveled, though it doesn't seem to be serious. The fit is nothing special. If they were half the price I would be satisfied, but for this price they do not live up to expectations. Overall these are inferior to my Unico Suspensor Long Underwear, both in fit and durability, and I will be looking for something in the Unico line to replace these."
1,awful product,we ordered it for use with a GBA. even with 2 hours of adult help it crashed the game multiple times. huge disappointment!
2,Stay away from this.,"I tried this with Shining Soul II, game would constantly select the last option on any menu.I tried this with Pokemon Pinball Ruby/Saphire, worked quite well.I tried this with Pinball of the Dead, the codes available both online and in the unit did not offer any real gameplay help.I tried this with Doom II, no codes available online or in the unit!Pros:1) Some games work.2) Menu system is easy to use.3) Unit can backup DS games.Cons:1) Company is not motivated to release new codes for existing games.2) Unit does not offer cheats for DS games.3) The scroll to last menu item bug prevents you from playing the games it affects."
4,"Awesome, but you have to be a pc wiz to go full power","This is a pretty lame device if you use it how your supposed to, but if you open it up, solder two prongs together, extract a save file, place it on your pc, then you can modify that save file with the right software! I got loads of awesome stuff hacking the save files in Animal Crossing: Wild World by modifying save files on the game card, and using the AR as a gateway from my pc to my DS. UNLESS YOU ARE AS SMART AS I AM, NOOBS, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MODIFY THE HARDWARE OF YOUR AR MAX DOU. I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE.Thank you."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!,Everything intec makes stinks it either doesn't work like it's supposed too. The action replay gliches up your games ecspeccialy pokemon games. not a good thing to buy it will ruin your games atakes up a lot of your time!!!!!!<also do not let friends borrow it unless they know exactly what they're doing>
2,defective-ness!,"Okay, so you're wondering ""Should I get this?"" Well, if you get a working one, the answer is YES. However, I have tried to get a working one TWICE and failed completely once and mostly failed on the second try. If you can get the codes working, apply this to any game: replay value x100. It's just fun to mess with the game in ways that weren't supposed to happen. A pc link would make adding codes a hassle-free process. Being able to copy saves from Animal Crossing would be awesome. The problem is getting the darn thing to work.With my Action Replay, it won't link to the pc no matter how many times I install/uninstall/reinstall the software. I now have to input about 20 lines of confusing characters MANUALLY (an example of a line of code: 1r24frth6). If it worked for the ds, I might forgive it, but it NEVER acknowleges that I have a DS cartrige inserted. Get a working one and you'll love it, but that's the problem. Better luck next time...."
4,good but acww doesnt work,"first of all, this does work. it doesnt have cheats for the ds, it was gamesaves. there are saves you can get on the internet or on the serverbut AC:WW doesw not work , im not sure i want to solder this thing but i might try someday"
5,ATTN: PEOPLE,"You need to read up on thing before you buy, first off the main comapny may not put out new cheat codes so what, you can do a simple google search to find ne wones, or make them yourself..you need to read up on things again before you buy, this does work ont he ds, it does work for AX:WW nintendogs(i have a giant chiauua), mario 64 and MK:DS and many many many more, you have to do the work yourselves, thru your gamesaves, you can also pretest this with much of the trainers etc that can be downloaded so it doesnt freeze up your games.I am a computer software moron, BUT i figuired this out in just about 10 minuites..If your lookign for a quick fix cheat device then no, of your looking to do some realy top of the line, off the wall tricks and hacks to make your friends go WOW then yes this is for you but be prepared to do some reading and a little of trial and error."
2,Not what I expected...,"Well I'm going to start with this. I cheat in my games a lot. I was eager to cheat in my DS games with this new product. However, once I opened it, I found it slotted into Slot 2, the GBA slot on my DS. Confused, I continued along, but was horrified when I found that all it did with the DS games was manage and download saves. The GBA codes worked better than they did with my old AR, but I was still disappointed."
1,worst thing you could buy,I buyed this a week ago and it broke already. it doesnt show game on the ds every time i start her up anymore. this is only good for a couple uses. its not worth $35. try getting gameshark instead. people dont waste your money on this hunk of junk.
1,Big Disappointment -Action Replay DS,"This product does not have any cheats for DS games.Animal Crossing Wild World DS is NOT SUPPORTED.We owned the previous version, and the kids loved using cheats for GBA. When we saw the DS version, we jumped on it. It doesn't do anything usful for DS except save games. And it doesn't even work for my kids favorite.Don't buy this for your kids - they will be disappointed."
3,It's cool,I just now recieved it and I'll need to test it on my Pokemon Leaf Green when I get it back from a friend but Shouldn't it have come with a Disk to install the software to the computer and to add on new codes if need be because I did not recieve that.
2,Ruff on Nintendogs,"I came to this review area as I was hunting for a ""cure"" to my son's Nintendogs problem. Thought I would just post a warning NOT to use Action Replay on Nintendogs. It has corrupted his game, and not only did he lose all his dogs and accessories, but it's a bit like Groundhog Day in that it won't save anything now. There are many postings about this problem on the website. He can acquire and train new dogs but when he shuts down, he has to start all over. We have used it with other DS games without a problem."
3,Broke my pokemon game.,I was using codes for my pokemon-leaf green edition.I turned on some codes. Then started the game and it freezes.It did this every time I turned on the game.
1,oh why Datel why?,"the action replay series of cheat devices are fairly good at what they do. However, this one does not. it claims to have hundreds of codes preloaded, and it does, just for the GBA. DS owners who are stuck on mission 22 of advanced wars DS will have to wait unitll Datel gets it right. Also it comes with the so called ability to connect this said product with your computer. once again it can, if your platform is Windows. Mac owners are out of luck again. This seems strange as Nintendo is in the same niche as Apple Computer is right now: a company that proplelled their industry in the 80s with a reputation of having high quality first party products and marching to a beat of their own. oh well. point is: wait untill a full DS action replay comes out.PS: VIVA LA REVOLUTION!"
5,Documentary is informative factual account,"America medical systems a joke, this man was a millionaire had all the best insurance but could not receive treatment when a full recovery was possible? Why?? Bc there many things that should Free-market but medical care should not be one. If you got the money (Bill Gate might) get a private doctor and Private insurance. But the rest of us need some wear to go other than the gutter or a ER.As sor acupuncture it clearly works."
4,Insightful journey to healing.,"This movie is interesting and sad on many levels. First hand, its a disturbing and sad fact that more young people in the US are experiencing strokes. Secondly, our country (the US) also is antiquated in its approach of care for this new demographic. The movie is inspiring in that, the stroke victim finds hope and help in China, utilizing acupuncture and Chinese medicine. In our country these services are available in limited practices but not covered by Medicare, Medicaid or most insurance plans. Further more, the lifestyle and diet of most Americans is a contributing factor to increased stroke cases, while big pharma and most western medicine discourage natural therapies, like Chinese medicine which have been used successfully for centuries. This movie brings these scenarios to light and could possibly be a positive influence on needed change in the US."
4,Excellent source of info,"I was impressed by how much information the authors fit into this one book: it's like a guide to a woman's body. One thing I especially liked about it was how well-organized it is: it has clearly-marked sections so you can flip to what you want to read easily. Full of helpful, simple diagrams. I thought I knew everything there was to know about my body until I read this book. Also does a good job correcting some of the common myths about everything from menstruation to rape. Has especially good information on contraceptives, how to keep yourself safe from assault, and a basic overview of every part of the body (from your eyes to your skin). Unlike some women's health books, this one covers more than the typical topics of menopause and menstruation.My only disappointments were that it barely covered same-sex love between women (barely two pages), and I would have liked more information on self-stimulation. Still, a great resource."
5,Your Majesty!,"Roberto Roselini reflects with absolute mastery, the last days of Mazarin, the scenes of this event, sensitive issues of state, tax adjustments, the reorganization of the economy, projects steers France to grant him eternal wealth and the endless intrigues, old quarrels, matters of state, sumptuous meals and palace life.With an admirable sense of ubiquity of camera, concise and direct dialogue that never fall into redundancy, managed to build an admirable Roselini story about the Sun King and the construction of the Palace of Versailles.A true testament about the life of Louis XIV. Be sure to see it."
1,Quelle misere!,"Who knew a movie about the Sun King Louis XIV could be so boring! Insipid dialogue, stilted acting, costumes that look like they were made by the mothers of Louis' kindergarden class, long, slow shots of Louis eating like a pig,,,, Avoid this one like the plague - if you want to learn something about Louis XIV do just about anything other than buy this movie - it immediately went into the pile for donation.... quelle tristesse...."
3,the taking of power by louis XIV,Very interesting. I enjoy reading or viewing the histories of the past about European countries ansd the monarchy. I really enjoyed this one.
5,You can judge this book by it's cover!,"Blood Shot Eyes delivers it all---drama, suspense, and intrigue. A crime story that you won't be able to put down. Readers will want to follow Ray Yale for years to come. Patrick Picciarelli proves that you can judge a book by it's cover. Buy it today."
1,don't buy these!!!!!!!!,knives look good out of package but they rust after like 5 washes DO NOT BUY THESE KNIVES THEY ARE JUNK!!!!!!
1,Worst thing I have ever bought on line.,This product does not even deserve a single star rating. I can't believe my eyes when I took the knife set out of the dish washer for the very fist time. There were rust forming in various spot through out all of the blades. I can't believe that Amazon would carry such a product. It should be found at a 99c store. I am very disappointed and learn my lesson not to trust any of Amazon bargain advertising again.
1,chi com junk,"I wish sellers would list where their products are made. I bought two sets of these knifes was annoyed to recieve somemore chinese communist stuff.I hate buying stuff from communist china.A good thing this stuff was so cheap. If this was supposed to sell for over three hundred dollars,I am the pope"
3,Knives are not worth it...,I received this as a Christmas gift and I am truly disappointed with the quality of the knives. They rusted! What am I to do with them now?! The only good thing about this set is the spoons/spatulas. Now I don't have to worry about scratching my T-Fal pans.So my advice to those who choose to purchase these after reading the reviews...do not wash them in the dishwasher...while it states that hand washing is recommended it does not say it is mandatory.
2,You get what you pay for,"This set leaves a lot to be desired.For starters, the knives aren't sharpened when you get them. I consider myself fairly skilled at sharpening knives, but this set is beating my best efforts.They are not well balanced, strike two. They all have full-tang handles, but the handles themselves feel cheap and not at all ergonomic, strike three. I would not recommend them.I thought I was getting a good deal. At least the lesson was not too expensive.No more bargain knives for me."
4,Great set for the home,"Dispite some bad reviews, I bought this set and let me tell you I think I got a bargain! The knives are heavy and look to be good quality. The tools are adequate for plastic tools. The stainless steel holder is great along with the measuring cups and spoons! I'm not going to complain about this set but I don't think it would be adequate for a chef it is plenty adequate for a home user!"
4,For $30 you cannot go wrong,"Why pay some hideous price for a knife set when you get the whole deal for a modest price. We have used these knives for several months and I cannot tell you how please we are with them. Sure you can pay prices upward of $800 for a set of knives that cut things. These cut things well and if they get dull, buy more. The feel, the balance, the weight and overall ability to do what you bought them for fits perfectly with us."
3,Received Damaged and Seems Cheap,"I received the set as a gift. The first thing noticed was how thin the stainless steel bucket was that holds the utensils. The second thing was a broken handle on one of the knives. Finally, I am a bit concerned by the manufacurer recommendation that the knives be hand-washed and dried vs. dishwashing so as to avoid the knives rusting."
1,DON'T HASSLE WITH THE HEADACHE,This was the worse knife set ever! it rusted the first time it was washed in the dishwasher. I bought a set for my mom and sister and theirs rusted too. Don't buy it and be disappointed and have to deal with a lot of headaches!
3,They Will Rust!,"Its a good looking set. My wood block looked impressive, and well made. The knives included are good, and sharp. But they do rust. I dont mind because these are just for a college house and we dont care as long as they cut.They Will Rust."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I purchased a set of Sabatier knives last November thinking I was getting a great deal. While the set is value priced, they are less than adequate and the handles on numerous knives are already seperating. You get what you pay for big time. Functional for a day to day basis, they will need to be replaced often. Makes me appreciate the nice Henckels I keep in a drawer and use much more often now."
2,Sabatier from China?,"I bought these b/c I moved away from home & thought a whole set would be convenience. This sounds like a good deal for the budget-minded, professional student. What a disappointment!!! Knives became dull after a week. The quality of the steel is not as described--not enough carbon is forced into that iron; just a thought--this would be false advertising from the manufacturer! It's NOT worth the savings! Take your [$] and invest in a German-made knife...buy the knives that you need and use. Hope this helps."
1,Do NOT Buy These Cheap Knives,I love to cook and I was missing one of my henkel knives and I thought the price of one henkel knife I could get a whole new set of knives...BUT I was really dissapointed to get these Sabatier knives. They are already showing signs of rust and are very cheaply made knives.....you get what you pay for...dont go for these knives and spend a little more to get quality products.
1,A cheap immitation of the real thing,These knives are NOT the real thing. I was very dissapointed that they are listed as true Sabatiers. They rust easily and I still have to use my old knives for cutting veggies. I am just happy I did not buy these for someone else at Christmas time. How embarrasing that would've been!
4,Great deal,I am a beginning cook and I find this knife set to be very nice. I think it is a great deal for someone looking to do light kitchen prep. It is not the ideal set for someone is wants to be a chef or is someone who will use them 3 times a day for heavy duty preparation for each meal. I recommend them. They would make a great gift.
2,"You get what you pay for, as usual.","The title says it best. Some of the specifics are that they do in fact rust in the dishwasher, and were quite dull out of the box. Not dull enough that they didn't cut, but dull enough that it made it difficult to cut and resulted in cut fingers.The dog enjoys the plastic utensils, though, hence the second star."
3,You get what you pay for,"I bought this set because I'd always heard that Sabatier was an excellent knife manufacturer. That reputation is based, however, on the products manufactured in France. This set is from the ""bargain"" line made in China. The quality is just not as good. The knives rust easily and are thinner and smaller. I had the same problem when I bought a ""bargain"" Le Creuset pan manufactured in China--not even close to the quality of the ones made in France.So, I would recommend this set to anyone who can't or won't pay the outrageous prices for the real deal. They're OK knives but don't live up to the name."
1,WORST deal ever!!,"I purchased this set few months ago, my biggest mistake. These knives are dully and rusty. I definitely not recommend this bargain to anyone at ALL."
1,Not the knives they're supposed to be!,"These knives are advertised as stainless steel, but are nothing of the sort! They completely rusted after being washed once! Save yourself the trouble and buy a set that you know is actually stainless, rather than risking tetnus with these substandard cutting tools!"
4,"Great set for $30, beter than anything else in price range","I had a cheap set bought at target for 5 years. I must have paid $40 for them. They were crappy, but when you are poor, you make do. This set is sooo much better than the set from Target. I know that some people say they are not too great. But for $30 they are fantasic! Get them and see for your self. If you do not like them, make them a wedding gift to a friend, they will like them.They are very good for the money. I still am shocked when I use them that I only paid $30."
5,Great set for the money,"This looks like it would be a cheep set, but everybody thinks that I paid over $100 for it. The knives are very sharp and think. They don't bend or lose their sharpness like you would expect from a set of this price. I've used them for months now, wash them in the dishwasher and they are all still in perfect condition. The tools that come with it is a nice bonus too. I would highly recommend this to anybody on a budget."
4,Great Set for the Price,"First of all, what do you want for the price. For $20.00 you can not beat this set. I think it is one step above a starter set. I've owned the set for 2 weeks and I'm very happy with them. The knife are sharp and feel well balanced. You can't go to Walmart or Target and beat this set for $20."
2,Ugh--unsharp!,"I bought this set and the triumph set, the triumph set is awesome, totally sharp and ergonomic. This set however, is dull, heavy and totally not worth the money. Get the triumph set, its worth it!"
1,Rusty Stainless Steel,"Don't bother with the ""deal"" these knives are unacceptably cheap even for the money. I hope that I can get a credit or a new set of more expensive knives that dont rust. Sabatier = FakeAtier"
2,"Terrible knives, great tools and utensils","The block and the tools are great but knives are dull. This is a great set for college students because it includes so many items for $28, but I wouldn't pay more than $5 for the knives."
1,Extremely cheap knife set,"I have had this knife set since the end of last year. The knives have already started to rust. I was very disappointed with this purchase. Obviously, they are not stainless steel. This knife set is NOT a bargain as far as I am concerned."
2,"Knives are decent, accessories are terrible","I finally gave in and bought this product during a friday sale for $19.99. I would not buy this product for anything more. The knives are decent. The measuring cups and teaspoons/tablespoons rust. (I have only had this product for about 1.5 weeks and some of the measuring cups I can not use anymore) The plastic tools that come with this set have short handles, affect the taste of your food, and are weak. I try to avoid using these unless I absolutely have to. I do like having this set around so I do not have to worry about the other people in my household screwing up my good knives."
2,DON'T BUY,"For the money wise, 49.99 seem to be a good deal. However, the knife set wasn't worth your money. it's has stain after few days used. The knives are not sharp at all.Don't buy themHowever, the measurement cups are very good. I loved that."
1,Sabatier Precision 38 Piece Knife Set,"I recently bought this set and, rust spot came on some of the knives very soon."
1,rust formed quickly,"For supposedly stainless steel knives, these developed rust spotting on the knives very quickly, either from running through the dishwasher or washing by hand - not even soaking in the sink. Definitely not worth the $25 I spent."
2,Not the Sabatier of old.,"This is a cheap Chinese version of the old Sabatier trade mark. Worth $29.99 but not a penny more. I can't beleive that this set evcer sold for $300. Maybe the European set of yesteryear did, but not this Chinese set. The pieces are not marked either stainless or carbon steel."
3,Before I Knew Much I Bought These,"This is not a serious knife set. Before I knew a lot about serious cooking and baking I thought it a great deal. I use the utensils but they are rather thin plastic. Still, better than the knives which just don't have an edge at all. The baking cups and spoons though are really nice, heavy and simple. Too bad the knives weren't better or this would be a good set."
4,Great Knives,"Great knives for a regular user, definitely not chef quality. They hold up very well and do what I need to do. However if you are looking for high quality knives for some serious cutting, you might probably look somewhere else."
2,Knifes are garabge ....,"I got this on Feb 2004 for $29.99 when i moved in to my new house. For that price, I won't complaint.The best thing in this set is the scissor and utensil holder.I threw out all the knifes after one year since they caused accidents since they weren't sharp.Utensils are ok, won't last (last ~2 yrs), better than 99 cents store's one."
2,Good Set for $30 or less DO NOT DISHWASH,Good set for $30 . We got them at a discount also last year (88% off).If you look after them and DO not put them in the dishwasher (WE did and the rust came on quicker than snowstorm) then these should be a great gift.Would not pay the price that they are today though. Wait for the discount.
2,Good beginner set...maybe...eh...,"It looks impressive, a $ 380.00 set of cutlery for less than $ 40.00. So yes, I ordered a set - I already owned a few Henckels - I lived in Germany - they are way more resonable there. Henckels is a great company. But Sabatier has a pretty good reputation...or so I thought...Until they arrived - I agree with most of the other raters. Nice set, but nobody home...meaning, it's not the quality I expected. I hate that kind of shapener.. (old fashined butcher type) I never get it right. I already had a set of Henckel steak knives and didn't realize that's what the row across the front of the wood block was. Oh well, I should have read or looked more carefully - but you can never have too many steak knives. Bottom line - for the serious cook - this is NOT the set at any price - for beginners.. it's ..umm OK. I am just a sucker for a bargain!"
3,don't wash high carbon knives in the dishwasher,"a note to the reviewers here... DON'T wash your high carbon steel knives in a dishwasher - no matter what the brand. always wash a good set of knives by hand, and dry them immediately."
4,Decent Value,"Even the best knives in the world may rust in the dishwasher. Do a search on Google for tips on how to prevent it, which is most likely going to say to hand wash your knives. How long these, or any product, lasts depends a lot on how you care for it.I purchased this knife set for $30 on Amazon, primarily because I didn't have any decent knives to cook with. The set consists of a nice set of items, including the cleaver. The wood block is decent and provides convenient storage for the set. I'll probably use the extra utensils as spares, but they look about average...again, for a $30 set, I wouldn't expect them to be silver plated.You get what you pay for, but for $30, this turned out to be a surprising deal. If you want the most ergonomic, heaviest, sharpest knives ever made, you are going to have to pay more than $30. The $400 ""retail price"" is pretty misleading, so don't try comparing this to an actual $400 set.In the end, it is a decent set for the money."
3,Carbon Steel is Supposed to Darken Over Time,"I won't buy this product because it's made in China, but having read reviews complaining of corrosion I had to at least write. High carbon steel knives hold a keen edge better than stainless steel. The trade-off is that they ""stain"" (darken) over time. I inherited a set of knives from my great aunt and they are black (they're over 60 years old), but they are keen. Samurai swords are made from high carbon steel. If you want shiny knives that's fine of course (buy Wusthof or Henckels), but if you want the best edge buy the made-in-France Sabatier."
1,don't buy these unless you can't afford anything else,"What can i say...i've bought two of these cheaper sabatier sets and hey...the saying ""you get what you pay for"" comes to mind here. BOTH times, the knives didn't fit in the block because the hole cut wasn't big enough. save your $ for some better knives... but i have to admit these knives are still better than the farberware POS's...the knives were actually a bit stronger than i thought. many of the cheap knives are so thin and flex when you cut, but the sabatier chinese made ones are slightly thicker and don't bend as easily as some of hte other cheapies...still...bottom line, save your $ unless you really just need an all in one set and don't have more than $60-70 to spend..."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I bought these knifes because they looked fantastic and they were a steal. First thing that happened is the knifes rusted. Now they are suppose to be stainless steel, figure that one out on your own. The price is unbelievable for a reason. STAY AWAY FROM THESE!!! Amazon wouldn't take them back since it was over 30 days. They rusted over after about 3 months of use."
2,"Poor, but at this price who cares","I'm a college student, needed a cheap Kitchen set. My roommates don't know how to handle knives (putting them in dishwashers, letting them sit in the sink, etc). So spending a lot of money wasn't an option.The balance is not bad, considering the price. They are not hard to handle, but they do ""feel"" cheap. They were not sharp, so I got the important ones sharpened right away (chef, slicer, utility, paring).My one big complaint is that they rust very quickly. The way we treat the knives I expected some rust but these are ridiculous. I end up giving them a CLR bath once a month to keep it under control. Just be aware of it.In short I recommend this to somebody who A) Has little money B) Needs nearly a full set of kitchen tools and C) Doesn't want to or know how to, correctly treat knives. If you fall into all three this is the set for you. Just don't pay more than $25 for it."
2,Not what I expected..,I expected a detailed book with case studies and explinations of them. This is a leaflet with a few interesting ideas.
2,"An oldie, but not bad.","I found the novel to be predictable, but the story was fairly good. You can tell that the author is well traveled, as the main character is very astute about other cultures. My only real complaint was that it took the story too long to build up to the point where you really wanted to know what was going to happen next. There was also a lot of political commentary, AKA Fahrenheit 451 style."
4,It put a smile on my son's face!,"I was skeptical making this purchase as my son is at the age where Legos are starting to lose their appeal. I still bought the Batmobile and to my surprise, my son grinned from ear to ear when he opened the present. He had great fun building the model and later adding his own modifications to it. The only downside is that the wheels with the real model were different from those portrayed on the box. A small but still annoying difference as far was I was concerned. Overall, I would recommend this for anyone who is a fan of the dark knight and of Legos. Besides, the projectile device on the front of the Batmobile is great for knocking over the henchmen."
3,Good debut from the San Diego based band,"Kenny Schoppmeyer has got to be one of the finest singers around,along with being an exceptional harmonica player.""Suffering The Blues"" is magical. The guitar playing of Mike Halls is a perfect back up to Kenny.Hear his soulful playing on ""Who Will The Next Fool Be"" Then we hear him swinging on ""She's Gone"",An extremely talented guitarist. If there is a weak link in this record,I would say it lies in the rythmn section, maybe a little uninspired.But still a good CD."
5,HEAVY..........,dropped this badboy into my samick custom. what a difference...replacing the stock pickup made me want to play again. you could toss this mother into a 2x4 and it would sound like a metal machine of doom......
1,somebody didn't have quality control for this product,"This mousepad is grammatically incorrect. It should say Why Santa Uses Reindeer, no apostrophe. This is elementary English here people, and it's pathetic this was marketed without somebody realizing it."
3,Lewis would appreciate it.,"Beautiful arrangements of classic hymns, with a few exceptions of more contemporary ones. Mr Lewis, I think, would have appreciated the effort of others to thank God for the life he lived.I think my favorite track is ""O Lord of Hosts, How Lovely."" Instead of the traditional ""St Edith"" tune, it uses a much more melodic and beautiful Irish tune called ""An Traigh Mughdhorna"". It's almost worth the purchase price by itself.I've had the disk for over a year. I don't play it as often as others I've had for as long, but in quiet evenings when I want something elegant and contemplative, it is very satisfying."
5,Terrific music ...,"...even if you don't know who in the world C.S. Lewis was. Ruut Salinen is superb (wish she would turn out more Christian music) and the Cherwell Mens Chorus is excellent. This one's hard to find and I was delighted to see it here. ""Jack"" would have been pleased, methinks."
5,Good Source of Info for Seniors,I have subscribed to this newsletter for quite a few years and will continue to do so. I think it is of more benefit to ladies over 50. I look forward to reading the informative articles each month.
1,There are worse movies but they are hard to find.,"Interesting plot, but bad script, bad acting, too much vulgar language, bad filmography, and bad acting. Did I mention bad acting."
5,HOT!,This SACD sizzles! This clean recording has some groovy Tower of Power-like tunes mostly with tasty funky organ interspersed with bop. It offers great party or crusin' music. So if you like funky organ jazz then this kickin' SACD is for you.
4,Peruvian Makeba,"This woman's song is so strong that it is apparent from the first track to the last that she has got incredible soul. The sheer poetry, and excellant musicianship of Los Amantes made me weep. I cant imagine in person what this music must be."
4,Relaxing and Evocative Poetry,"Susana has a beautiful voice and a wonderful presence. She expresses the poetry in each of her songs without sounding contrived. There are many styles coming together in her music (African, Peruvian, Cuban, and even a little Juju). The rhythms in her songs are gorgeous and hypnotic. My favorite songs on this album are ""Valentin"", ""Poema"", and ""El Mayoral"". I saw her perform live in Chapel Hill and bought this recording. The presence that she projects on this recording is even better live. If she is performing at a venue near you, don't hesitate!The recording quality on this CD is not so poor that it deserves one star! I appreciate the fact that David Byrne did not try to make Susana sing an amplified duet with Andrea Boccelli and a drum machine, or suffocate her in yet another Eno/Lanois production. The recording would have been better with more natural ambience, but the music is so good that you really won't notice."
5,Can't stop playing it,"I discovered this CD accidentally and I haven't been able to stopy playing it. I carry around 1,500 songs on my iPod, but I've been playing this over and over again for the past 4-5 days. The music is so rich and poetic that every time I hear a song I seem to discover something new about it. I don't understand Spanish, but the phonetics of the words are so beautiful that they are songs all by themselves. I highly recommend this CD and can't wait to get her entire discography."
5,Larry's Dance Theme on vinyl. A rare and hard to find classic.,The last time the song last appeared on radio in my hometown was last year in the mix and couldn't name what track it was until I finally found the song off of you tube was Larry's Dance Theme instead of Larry Love the rap song that I finally found and took me over 28 years to finally hear the song for the first time in a long time and it was the tightest jam that I got down with my badself and now I got them both on vinyl and CD I can still get down and jam to Larry's Dance Theme on vinyl or on CD. That album needs to be re-issued on vinyl in a 180 gram high definition virgin vinyl press so that everybody will have a chance to buy the album at a special low price for the diehard Grandmaster Flash fans and to the diehard hip hop fans around the world. Peace.
5,Carry the Wind,"Terry Johnston is one of my favorite western writers. I believe if he was still alive he would be writing wonderful stories like this one. Be sure to start at the begining of this series of the story of Titus Bass and Josiha and follow these fictional trappers intertwind with non-fiction events and people. I travel a lot and am not able to read other than on the plane and pick up the story any time I pick the book up.The next book in this series is Borderlords followed by, One Eyed Dream, Ride the Moon Down, and finally Wind Walker. Enjoy!"
2,Carry the Wind,"I've just listened to the audio book: Carry the Wind; I was very disappointed as I have read four of his other books and enjoyed the detail of the times...this was abridged to about an hour and a half and lacked color and detail of the full written novel...all I can say that is positive is: that is easy to listen to in a short time...(one CD) and the narrator was clear and talented with the characters..Audrey in Diamondhead, Ms."
3,"No sure, I don't remember buying this...",But I'm in a reviewing mode and they want me to review this one so that's all I have to say!
5,Most informative and helpful book I have read.....,"I cannot express the importance of the information in the ""Polio Paradox"". I wasn't diagnosed until 2003 with Post Polio Syndrome and never diagnosed as a child. My memories of illness in 1952 and the onset of PPS symptoms in 1976 eventually helped me out of the denial that I had polio and now suffering from its ""impositions."" Without the astute, scientific and sensitive investigations of my physician and the information from Dr. Bruno I would not have made it through the denial and into a growing understanding of the symptoms and ongoing enigmas that Post Polio Syndrome brings. The book has become a bedside reading whenever I am puzzled, overwhelmed, scared and curious about the enigma this disease has brought me. -lori cordini, Boone, NC"
3,Runs short is an understatement!!!,Runs short is an understatement... other than that it's totally cute and my daughter is so excited to wear it for Halloween!!!
2,Horrible quality,"This product was falling apart before we opened the package. Holes in the fabric at the seams, and the bat symbol was only half sewn on. The manufacturer didn't include one of the arm bands. I didn't have time to replace it before the costume party. It looks really cool on my daughter, hence the 2 stars."
2,Mask did not hold up.,"The costume was ok, except that the size listed did not reflect the appropriate age group. My daughter is 5 & tall/petite. She needed a small size according to what was written. When I got the package, it stated that the item was for a 3-4 yr old. It wore like a shirt instead of a dress. The belt had a black stain, the mask was too small and the black leggings were too loose."
5,review,Good product. Was a good price and a good buy for the price. Probably still but again next year.very very good
5,Great buy!,"I bought this costume because my friends and I decided to go as superheroes for Halloween. Because all 4 of us are girls, we wore costumes for the following: Superwoman, Wonderwoman, Spiderwoman, and of course, Batwoman. This costume has a great look and fit, although i chose not to wear some elements (such as the boot covers and arm covers. I was planning on wearing the mask, but we decided to do matching make up.) The product came on time, complete at the pictures shows. You won't regret your purchase! I loved it! ;)"
4,Adorable and easy to wear,"Fast delivery. The costume was adorable and easy to wear by my five year old daughter. I was glad I purchased the larger (8-10) size, although a litte big, she will be able to wear it again for dress up or maybe next Halloween."
4,Sizes are misleading!,"The costume says its size 4-6, and fits children 44-48"". When I received it, however, the size small package says it is 2-3T. It is tiny. I ordered for my soon to be 6 year old who wears a size 5T and is 44"" tall. This would NEVER fit her the way it fits in the photo. She should be well within the range stated, but instead the costume is sized for a toddler. Had to send back immediately and replace with a medium, which is for children 4-6T. Looks to be good quality, but Very unecissarily confusing!"
4,"Good costume concept, flimsy materials","Like a lot of Halloween children costumes, it looks good but begins to tear after a couple of uses. Not meant for regular play."
3,nice bat girl shirt,Buy this costume at least 2 sizes too large. My daughter is wearing it as a shirt with pants. It's that short!
3,Mask was damaged,"Great costume, however, mask was damaged - not MUCH of a big deal but it didn't fully complete the costume without the mask."
4,"Holy Halloween, Batgirl!","I ordered this for my 4 and a half year old daughter for Halloween. She is delighted with it, and I'm pleased too. Compared to many other costumes, I think the quality is pretty good, and you get a lot of accessories. It's a comfortable pleather dress (seriously short- go up in size if your superhero is tall or between sizes), a detachable cape which is generously cut, a tie on yellow belt, mask, and boot covers. Pros- Pretty durable, fun, comfortable, easy to layer or not for the weather, good value. Cons- The mask is a more brittle plastic than the rest of the costume and probably won't last much longer than Halloween, tunic is short. Bottom line - go for it- she'll love it and you'll get good play value out of the dress and cape after Halloween."
5,great costume,"My daughter loves this costume. We ordered a bit big so the arm and leg bands are a bit floppy, but she will get lots of use out of it and loves it all the same. Great quality for the price."
3,"A good watch, but you need to use it constantly","I had other automatic watches in the past, like Citizen, and I remember using them on and off during the week, without having to worry that if I stopped wearing them for a while they might have stopped working. Well, with this watch, if I take it off, let's say today, and I want to use it again in a couple of days, I need to set the time again because the mechanism will stop at some point. I have no complaints about the looks, for this is a nice looking watch..."
2,Not as expected,When I bought these earrings I didn't realize they would have words and little plastic eyes glued on to them. They are much more childish then I expected.
2,cheap made,the earrings were cheap made except the wire was silver. A sticker placed on a teardrop piece of metal I suppose it an steel alloy. One was off center and had a buckle in the sticker. It wasn't laying straight. Looks pretty in the picture but wasn't what I expected.
4,The Winged Dragon of Ra,"It's great. It's fun pretending your yugi beatin Seto Kaiba or even just having a laugh with your friends.Overall good but you can't use it in tournaments.This card's effects are:The ATK and DEF of this card are equal to the combined ATK and DEF strengths of the monsters used to Tribute Summon this card. By paying 1000 Life Points during your Main Phase, or when this card is Special Summoned from the graveyard, destroy 1 monster on your opponent's side of the field. You can pay any amount of Life Points down to 1 to increase the ATK and DEF of this card by the amount paid. When this card attacks after using this effect and destroys a monster on your opponent's side of the field, destroy all monsters on the opponent's field. Tribute any number of monsters on your side of the field to increase the ATK or DEF of this card by the combined ATK or DEF of the Tributed monsters."
5,Outstanding,"I read Kezi's first book, ""John Riley's Daughter."" I loved it! Her style of writing is so unique and keeps the reader very interested. Now comes, ""Scorpio Child,"" which is written in that same unique manner. You just have to keep reading until you finish the book. There's no putting it down. I recommend it highly for readers of all ages. ""Thanks Kezi, can't wait til your next book comes out!"""
1,The Knives Suck!!!,"Ok, I am not that picky of a knife person. But these knives are REALLY bad. It sounds cool that you're getting a ""fantastic deal."" Yea, you're getting something like $160 discount!Don't buy it. I did and they rust and they are not that sharp at all. Plus the handle is plastic...cheap plastic!The ONLY good thing w/ this set is the wooden block. If you want to pay the total amt for the wooden block...it's a GREAT buy. However, the knives are bad, bad, bad..... Seriously, buyer beware!!!"
1,Thai for Beginners,"If you are English speaking and want to learn Thai, this set of tapes seems to be more thorough than others available. However, you can not use the set of tapes without the book. There are some words and phrases that have the English meaning but much of it is in the Thai language without any translations into English. The instructions say to listen to a conversation between two Thai people, and you have no idea of what they are talking about. You are refered to the page number and section number in the paper book. Therefore, you can not use it without the book. It should not be sold by itself at all. I am ordering the book and assume the English meaning for these conversations are in the paper bound book. At that point, it should be an excellent course."
1,No tape or CD included,"I don't know why no one has bothered to mention this, but this book does not come with a tape or CD. You have to order the CD separately and it's not cheap, costs more than the book. I got the book and it's useless without the audio recording. I am going to order the recording, and hopefully will not be disappointed (again)."
1,NO BOOK??????????????,Surprise.surprise!Completely useless without the book.What book?Who knows?I'm still searching and am sure they'll Kaching me some more.Don't buy the tapes you will be confused and bit miffed I'm sure.....
1,unsuccessful on MacIntosh. nowhere did it say that on the site.,I own the book- I love it. I thought the cd would bring me back into learning the material. It's WINDOWS ONLY.is amazon going to pay for it to be shipped back??otherwise I have wasted my $$$
3,Thai for Beginners,"Well, it's early days but..so far, so good! It does what it says on the tin! But when you order this book you really must order the CDs as well. I don't think you can hope to success without the CDs. It would be better if both items were advertised together."
5,Better then all other book/audio combination i've seen...,This past year i've been looking for a good book/audio combination to learn Thai.Quality of the tapes is good and the possibility to do the writing and reading at the end of each lesson is perfect!You can't learn Thai properly if you can't read and write it!And it's easy in this set!That's what makes this set (and the following set's) better than the other (more expensive!) learning programs.
3,excellent content but poor printing quality,"Second copy I purchased after giving the first one away. The content is still excellent. It is almost a combined beginner-intermediate level. However, the quality of the printing has deteriorated; the ink seemed faded on many pages with some of the letters fading at the edge. Readable but irritating."
4,Thai,'Thai for Beginners' is used at local (Thai) Buddhist temple for language classes and most members find it useful. Standard textbook.
4,Great Book!,"Just a really good beginner book.But because you have to buy the tapes separately, I am only going to give it four instead of five stars.Cheers!"
3,Room for improvement...,"This program is sort of the poor man's Rossetta Stone. The informatin is not presented in an interesting fashion and is mainly rote memorization (without even pictures). It is basically like a giant digital flashcard.Also, there is a note inside which says it is compatable with Vista. THIS IS NOT TRUE. THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT WORK WITH VISTA. I had to load it onto one of my older computers to finally get it to work. There is an email in the manual for technical support which I wrote to twice, but did not receive any response.This program isn't too expensive, but you are probably better off just buying the book and CDs rather than this software addition."
3,Thai for Beginners Cd,"The Thai for beginners CD is a must accompany with the book, it is very helpful with the book. But, I was very disappoint the quality of the first CD1 because it has jittering sound from trac 14 to 19 on CD1 look like the sound got stuck (jittering sound and pulling a rubberband, (I do not know how to explain) and the CD2 was fine.I think I got the defect CD1. The cd itself does not has any scratch at all."
1,Will not run on 64-bit computers!,"Although it seems to be mentioned nowhere in the Amazon ad, the help file that is installed with the software says that this software is only compatible with OSs through XP: Vista or 7 compatibility are not stated.The publisher's website states that for Vista and 7, the program requires 32-bit (which no modern computers run).So, beware! This software will most likely not run on any modern system.Note: the one star review is for Amazon's ad and the publisher's lack of making sure this information is clearly stated, not for the quality of the product (which I cannot run)."
4,Tape Series,"Tapes are very helpful to use in conjunction with the book. One of the better tape series as it has a lot of vocabulary not just phrases, which helps a lot with pronunciation."
4,Thai For Beginners,"I thing that this book is a good choice to buy, because it teaches you how to pronounce, and say the words correctly. It is also a great price compared to some of the other online bookstores."
4,language,"i bought this thai language much cheaper then rosestone translator, save me money. so i can learn when i traveral to thailand and understand them."
3,works on different levels,"The book works well for learning Thai, and what I like is that the book works on several different levels, so you can learn as a raw beginner or you can use this book to try to learn to read and write Thai script as I am attempting to do. I believe this book will be very helpful to do so."
3,Interesting Addition to the YES DVD Catalog,"What's this? A DVD focusing on a band in which critics say *negative* things as well as positive things? Well, that's right -- ""Inside Yes"" features lesser-known musicians/rock critics/producers/engineers commenting--good and bad-- on Yes' first six studio albums--""Yes,"" ""Time & A Word,"" ""The Yes Album,"" ""Fragile,"" ""Close to the Edge,"" and ""Tales from Topographic Oceans."" There's a good balance between those who praise and dismiss elements of the music, so that is probably the most interesting thing about this DVD. The archival footgage is mainly from ""Yessongs,"" so don't expect to see anything new visually--unless you're a newcomer to the band's work. Regarding interviews with actual bandmembers, there are just a few snippets of Howe circa 2003/2004. Towards the end of the DVD, it's fun to quickly go from one critic calling an album a ""masterpiece"" and another calling it ""rubbish."" There's not much ""meat"" to this DVD, but it makes a nice appetizer."
4,Interesting addition for Yes collectors,"This DVD was about 60 minutes long. Using several critics, they reviewed and critiqued the first albums and songs of Yes. I liked: It was very interesting to hear the reasons the critics liked or disliked the album or song. There was also a guitar player that demonstrated the cord progressions on several songs. I did not like: The DVD did not play entire songs. There was just enough music to remind the viewer of what the reviewer was reviewing. Note: This DVD is the documentary part of another DVD titled: Yes: Total Rock Review (2006). The only difference that I could find between the two was that the Yes: Total Rock Review (2006) had about a dozen pictures in a gallery and Rick Wakeman playing solos of Long Distance Runaround, Awaken and Close to the Edge on a Steinway piano."
2,disappointed,"I looked everywhere for a toddler memory book and finally bought a ""used"" one online. it's more for babies than for toddlers and has very few places to put pictures. much too wordy for me. i like the idea, but not the book."
1,Very basic kanji--won't get you far,"This workbook only includes 70 kanji and uses very remedial sentences for examples. If you are an adult who is seriously trying to learn the kanji for adult activities like reading the newspaper, reading adult books, surviving in Japan or passing the jlpt, this workbook is not going to take you very far.For learning kanji, the absolute best resource I have found is Tadashii Kanji Kakitorikun. But you will need a nintendo console to play it."
1,Sizing is flat out wrong,"Well constructed garment; however, the sizing is completely WRONG. I ordered 3x to use for laying with other clothes. It's about a size Large. Maybe smaller. Just because you put the label 3x on something doesn't make it that size. Products going back."
1,Eidon Moisturizing Lotion Smells like burnt skin!,"I was excited to find a natural skin moisturizing lotion with MSM & Silica though I did not order this item through Amazon. It has the most repulsive burnt smell that I have ever encountered and there is no way to use this product without feeling ill, especially if you are smell sensitive. I additionally purchased the Eidon California Gold Sunblock.....same disgusting smell! They both have extracts of Hops which may be the offending smell culprit."
2,Great premise; wrong movie,"Pick Me Up offers a great premise: What if a motorist who kills hitchhikers picks up a hitchhiker who kills motorists? Imagine the taut, suspenseful, claustrophobic film that would develop as these two psychopaths try to kill one another. I would love to see that movie! But that's not this movie. Instead, Pick Me Up is a slighter, kind of hammy horror movie, which is expected since Larry Cohen (of Q fame) is the helmer. I think that the movie wastes time with the broken-down bus scenario. Characters are introduced that we don't need to know. I would have preferred that the two killers encounter each other right away. I do not mind the addition of a third character in jeopardy (we need someone to root for) but Fairuza Balk, a good actress, is mostly wasted. The guy playing the hitcher is forgettable, although Michael Moriarty is quirky and funny as the truck driver. The twist is amusing, although nowadays having a twist seems like a cliche."
3,An okay movie with a lame ending.,"Not a terrible horror film. It held my interest until the end, as I was interested in seeing how the girl escaped these two killers. I was disappointed that this horror film took the easy way out and again the main character does not make it in the end. Too cliche. Horror films do this way too much. Many times evil is defeated, only to pop up on the screen at the end of the movie, or we hear an evil laugh in the distance. It's bullcrap. Why couldn't the main character be [...] and kill the killers. They build her up to be all tough and self reliant, only to fail in the end. lame."
3,Not a good horror story but ok,"This indeed did not belong in a Masters of Horrors series as it was more of a phsycological thriller to me, and not a good one at that. I bought it to watch it and because the completest in me couldn't go on without having every title of the series. To me it was the weakest of them all."
2,Typical Horror Movie,"This movie was alittle better then expected but not by much. The movie definently had a good choice for a cast. Each star of the cast did a good job, but the plot could have been alittle better. The end was something I was not expecting. I did make me wonder what would happen next. Although it was alittle confusing. But it was an okay movie, definently one to rent to see if you like it."
4,This is indeed a pick me up!,"I'm writing on simply the movie itself, not the dvd. The movie short is about (without giving too much away)...well, let me start over...The angle of this movie, is that there is usually a killer vs. victim relationship going on... well in this one, that is true... but its a dichotomous relationship! There are two killers, and in the middle... The ever so creepy, yet incredibly hot Feruza Balk!This movie is straight, no chaser! It will take you through a twist of whose who, and leave you wondering who will walk out alive? if at all.I'm probably not doing the film justice, so lets see if I can entice you quickly: decapitations, violence, creative disposal of bodies, massive killing, and a neat use of a dead rattle snake.I suggest giving it a try!"
4,a different record by the pals,"it took me a while to get in to this record. its a mix of old school rockabilly and country sounds. the production is alright, sounding like an old sun records record. most of it is recorded in mono, with a few in stereo. it captures the cool antique sound of the early elvis records. sonically its different then the stereo we are used to these days. musically the playing is pretty good. the songs are catchy. its a different record for the guys though. if you liked the 1st 2 records, you'll hear the similarity. give it a few spins and you are sure to get into it. its a new musical journey from the paladins, a band who has so many influences, that you'll never get bored. a good record."
2,Not quite the Paladins,"Brought up on the hard rockin' agressive style of the Paladins this album comes as a little of a dissapointment, the 'billy edge seems to have gone which for me was always what the Paladins were about. I've played it once and no tracks really hit me and it's now consigned to the CD shelf. Are we losing that Paladin sound we need.......!?! I've ordered Palvoline so we'll see."
2,hard to rate,"the good: product arrived earlier than expected. the bad: unfortunately, i can't rate the product. amazon failed to describe the unit as an 8 pin dip pole transmitter, I needed a 10 pin. I'm being charged a 20% restocking fee plus a $5 S/H fee. too much for $11 item. Unlucky me, I had purchased 3 units."
3,it works...if thats what you want to know.,"our apt. complex uses these. works fine, a little tricky setting up. but easy enough. the little key ring plastic piece broke, that was lame."
4,This is durable and works.,Other reviewers were stating that the durability of this product was in question. They had experienced plastic key chain holder to crack after a drop on a hard surface. I have not observed this after a few drops. It seems very durable construction. I would think that the manufacturer must have improved the plastic formula.....I have had no problems. Also it was easy to program. It has a decent range - not extraordinary
1,mini keychain garage door opener,"This is a great little remote, very handy to have on a keychain. It is a much safer alternative than leaving the remote in the car. Car theives can't easily open the garage door if they don't have the remote! The downside is these little remotes break easily if you drop them, especially with the weight of your keys."
2,"stale and crystallized, not as chewy as they should be",These Sweet Tarts Shockers I recently got are unfortunately stale and crystallized -- not as chewy as they should be. The colors are also bleached out and not as bright as fresh Shockers.
1,FV-08VKSL3,Panasonic fan housings are a sad joke. The outlet is made in a shaggy and cheap way with some narrow foam seals that first need to be compressed and then two parts of the housing slide over each other to get in place - the task that is really frustrating even on a bench (can't even imagine to accomplish this in the ceiling). Housings are made for the one size fits all concept. These fans might be electrically good but mechanically are a total junk. Cheap China-made stuff. Very disappointed.
2,Don't DO IT! Your mind will shatter.,"Written poorly. This book is not for everyone. The author of the first chapter refers mercilessly to later chapters over and over again, defining introductory concepts using advanced terms. How many times the phrase ""you need to remember this now, but we will not cover it until chapter 10, 11, 13"" whatever occurs.My mind was shattered on the examples, which use inside computer-humor as examples (tags named foo, foobar, etc) of xml tags. How about using something the average reader can relate to, such as ""textcolor"" or perhaps ""smallfont?"" Oh no, all we get is random.tag, foobar, and other touchstones which are useless to a reader not part of the subculture.I really wish I had not purchased this book. I give it two stars because I think it will be later as a reference once I have actually learned XML. Until then, this book will remain in a box, and if I could, I would return it for another book."
1,Hodge-podge!,"This book is a cut-n-paste from numerous other Sybex books. Skip it! Buy the other books ... this one jumps all over the map, often referring to other books or chapters ahead in the current book. Very annoying and a difficult way to learn!"
3,underwhelmed,"I had high hopes for this one after reading all the glowing reviews. I lucked into finding a very cheap copy (I'm shocked at the high prices this is selling for online as I write this) in the discount bins of a local shop earlier this year, so I bought it. Played it a few times and wasn't knocked out, so I played it some more, and I'm still feeling underwhelmed. There are a few really good songs on here, but also a lot of mediocre compositions that just don't go anywhere. Sorry, but this is not the great lost power pop album or anything remotely that fabulous."
4,Elliot's only solo so far.,"Cars guitarist Elliot Easton released ""Change No Change"" #99 in 1985. I remember getting this on a cold snowy winter day the first day it came out in Salina, Kansas at the famous ""House Of Sight And Sound"". The music on this disc kind of resembles The Cars and adds some flavor from Jules Shear who he collaborated with on this album.It opens with ""Tools Of Your Labor"", a good song with an even catchier chorus. ""(Wearing Down) Like A Wheel"", #36 mainstream rock, his big hit here, great rocker with some good synths. ""Change"", is one funky little number, ""(She Made It) New For Me"", is as close to a Cars type song, ""Help Me"", kind of a 60's type pop-rocker, the hard rockin' of ""The Hard Way"" and my favorite song was ""Shayla"", who we named our first daughter after in 1990. Elliot has done a lot of stuff since, but were waiting for The Cars reunion in 2011."
1,Not for powerful chewers,"My 10 month old lab destroyed this within an hour of me giving it to him. I should have read the description much more carefully, so that's on me, but I wanted to try something to help keep his teeth and gums healthy."
4,Beautiful Designs That Take Some Work,"What could be easier? The cut and paste of these ready-to-use scrapbook pages invite beginning and experienced scrapbookers/card creators to jump right in. Unfortunately many of the designs are not mortised; for example a heart pastes in with a rectangular border, not as a perfectly edged heart. So you need to do a freeform crop which DOES work; it just takes time. Nevertheless the designs are lovely and appropriate for many applications."
5,Lovely Book,"This just came in the mail and I am already planning on what I can do with the images. Cards, wall art, special gifts etc. Vintage Valentines, some patriotic, roses, frames and more. I love Victorian and Edwardian themes and I know I will be using this over and over. Since I own many of the other books in this series I can see where I can interchange images and really have a lot more options. For me these books work, but for those with less vintage taste they may want to look elsewhere for clip art."
3,Lots of pictures but a little too antique looking,Images were a little TOO classic and old fashioned for my taste but there are many pages to choose from and it can be used to make a very beautiful scrapbook.Bottom line if you like contemporary looking scrapbooks stay away from this one.
4,Very Good Entry in Series,"It's good to see The Robotic Mr. Gordons back, one of this series best villians. Story moved right along, some funny stuff as well."
4,Great insight giver.,"I never really grasped the meaning of SQ-1. After reading this book, I can say that now I have a much better grasp. I think that Mr Mazur's approach, that is transmiting understanding instead of overkill problem solving would greatly benefit our math education approach specially considering that 1- most people will never use this stuff again, 2- Grasping the matter might motivate some to continue on in math thereafter. For the poetry of the book, apart from the Baudelaire poem ( fabulous) the rest doesn't do it for me."
1,Not For Scientists,"While this book might be very interesting to people who enjoy ""thinking about thinking,"" it has very little value for people who are interested in logical reasoning and cold, hard facts. Read this book only if you are enthusiastic about poetry."
2,More than just math - yet not interesting,"I have read a few math books, prime obsession most recently, and this book wasn't technically very interesting, it also wasn't fun to read either. There are some good parts at the very beginning and end but middle is incoherently dry. Basically I believe that in some ways the way the author was trying to thought provoking and intelectual is where it lost it's was. Neither technical, historical, or fun enough you lost your audience"
3,An interesting ramble,"I enjoyed this book and read it to the end, but it had its frustrations. In particular, assuring the reader they won't need more than limited high school math doesn't take into account that they may have forgotten it. The briefest refresher (in the back?) about manipulating equations in algebra would have helped a lot.Also, saying ""try it yourself"" and then not going over it in case the reader was hopelessly lost was a bit annoying.Still, any attempt to rejoin the arts and sciences is a good thing; and most of the book was comprehensible."
3,Could have been better,"The book is ultimately about how to understand/visualize imaginary numbers and its operations (addition/multiplication). (By visualize I mean visualizing these numbers, operations in the ""complex plane"".) In my view the book could have been better had Mazur included a section or two on his personal view of what ""mathematical imagination"" consists of. Such inclusion wouldn't have done any harm to the over all pedagogic tone of the book, and would have added value for the mathematics community as well, especially given the fact that Mazur -- recipient of the Steele/Veblen/Cole prizes -- would have so much to offer in this regard. Without such inclusion the book is still beautiful and enjoyable, but for readers already acquainted with the notion of the complex plane, it has not much to offer other than 1) the various connotations of [literary] imagination, and 2) the historical development of notions of solutions to algebraic equations."
1,Convoluted prose obscures the main ideas,"I read this book when I was 18, largely because of Barry Mazur's reputation as a mathematician. His attempts to compare complex numbers to poetry obscures the main algebraic and geometric ideas, and is certainly not the way a mathematician ever views complex numbers. After I studied algebra in university it made me realise how truly bad this book was. If you really want to read a book that answers ""what is so special about i?"", then pick something else."
5,Their greatest accomplishment........miles above the rest.,"There will be no fan of DFD disappointed with this one. Every aspect of DFD is here, heavy groovy guitars, wonderful keyboards that never disappoint, solid drumming, lots of horns and Todd Smiths awesome vocals. Sure he does resemble General(Mike) Patton in ways but what else is new......a concept album. This is what one would expect from DFD a metal,rock,jazz,funk hybrid, very interesting to say the least. The arrangements are wonderfully put together and the musicianship is in high form.'Anarchists' was refreshing,'Bright Future' was awesome but 'Adultery' leaves these albums in the dust."
4,Can U Outbungle Mr Bungle?,"Catchy as Hell.Adultery is a hell of a ride with great catchy and diverse songs and I?ve been listening to it for a week now.Great stuff, no doubt.That said, as remarked in another reviewDFD always try to resemble Mr Bungle, and Adulterygoes so far, the subtitle might as well be""Having Mike Patton?s Baby"".I guess to these guys originality is overrated.The singer goes as far as recycling a Tomahawk lyric,""You show me yours I ll show you mine"". Ripping off vocal delivery, voices, noises, effects, sense of humour and now even the lyrics verbatim.Don t get me wrong, I like this album a lot.But is the singer just sitting around waiting for the next Mike Patton project to come along and show him some new tricks?These guys are clearly talented as hell in their own right-WHY CAN T THEY FIND THEIR OWN STYLE AND SOUND ?What would these guys sound like if Mr Bungle were still together?Anyway, great album, butno points for originality."
2,Expected a little bit less...,"I've been a fan of DFD for quite some time now, and I have to say that I was a little dissappointed in this album. It is just a little too polished and too ""mainstream"" for me. I usually have no problem with a band sidestepping their artistic side to go more mainstream if it works for them, but DFD was known for their funny/innovative yet brutal metal and intriguing time changes and signatures. Seemed to me on this album, they were just trying to record something to put it out. They left the artistic side out of this one a little bit. I still like it, but I expected less of an album. It's production quality is very high, but that takes away from a band like this if you ask me."
3,good intro but could be better,"This video is a good introduction to sports massage. What frustrated me about this video was the angle of the camera work. Often times when the technique was being demonstrated what you saw was the back of the massage therapist instead of the hands/arms doing the work. While the narrator was describing the technique the camera was showing the back instead of quickly showing the hands doing the technique, in other words, too much lag time. Clean this up and this would be a very good introduction to sports massage."
2,Dull,"These are very well made shears - but they arrived dull, and were unable to cut hair. After an additional 6$ sharpening they do work fine."
5,Cool animation! I love it.,"It incorporates the sword play and modern machinery as one.The effect is good. Especially the transformation effect. Cool!Story is simple but good. If u think further, it reflects the world we r living in. The desire we r craving for."
1,A pretty mess,"The slick CG fight scenes aren't enough to pull off this anime. The story is a mess. It is incoherent and jumps all over the place. It's all mood with no substance. I don't care about the ""brooding"" Karas character or the other wannabe ultra cool characters who walk around aloof like rejects from a James Dean audition. Save yourself some time and get something with originality, story and characters (like Ghost in the Shell, Paprika, Akira or Porco Roso) rather than a pitiful patchwork of rip offs that Karas is."
2,"Good visuals, very confusing story",I was really impressed by how the movie looked visually; but then I started to try and figure out what was going on in the story.......and was extremely confused. The reason I gave this anime 2 stars was because the story was so hard to follow I turned it off a little less then half way through.
4,Amazing animation and musical score,"The American release of Karas: The Prophecy has been compared to Batman, which is a little misleading. The Karas is sort of a ""Spiritual Batman""....that is he doesn't mess around with petty purse-snatchers but goes straight for the denizens of the demon world who ambiguously threaten all of humanity. In fact, he doesn't really interact with the ""real"" world as humans know it. The story is a little vague but The Prophecy is just part one of two (the Japanese version is a 6 part series and from what I've heard 'The Prophecy' release is the first 3 parts spliced together.)The animation and action sequences are amazing but would be more enjoyable with a better developed storyline. The musical score is excellent and powerful for the over the top action sequences. I highly recommend this movie just for the animation if nothing else. Hopefully the second half will fill in the gaps in the story and make it a more complete experience overall."
5,Karas--The Prophecy,"I'm very picky aobut my anime; it has to have the perfect voices, i have to like the animation, and the colouring. This anime fit the mold excellently. It has the right amount of adventure to quench my thirst for it. The voices are superb (alot of the voice talent i didn't know it was them until the credits). The anime was beautifully done. The CG couldn't have been done better. The whole anime was intense had me rooting for everyone (except for the bad guys). And the storyline.... *looks dreamy* WOW!Now there's six dvd's (three have been released in Japan) and I can hardly wait to see the next one.This has to be one of the best anime's out there. If you're an anime fan or just like a good, heart pounding adventure with some really good fighting scenes this is the anime for you."
3,"Good, but not THAT good.","I've been into anime for quite a long time now, and I've got to say that this has to be the most overrated OVA I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong- I think most of the action sequences are pretty cool, and the musical score is just great- but Karas lacks the depth that usually makes anime so appealing. It stands as a fair try by its creators, but it seems to me that a lot of scenes they intended to be artistic/mysterious came off mostly as confusing/unclear/I don't understand what this is."
3,It's no classic.,This anime story was confusing and had no backround what so ever about the story. The animation was good but choppy and too fast during the fighting scenes to see all that was going on. All in all not worth the price.
1,An exercise in futility,"Thank God this was only a rental. It look very promising during the first couple of minutes of aerial fighting. But you quickly realize that this anime is nothing more than one big lump of nonsense.Apparently, it's getting rave reviews from a fringe audience.You have been warned."
5,Karas- The Prophecy,"This anime is fun to watch. This anime is a little serious and somewhat hard to follow, but is somewhat interesting to watch. This anime features a being known as Karas who fights deadly monsters that feed on humans. Karas can be reborn as different people when one Karas is defeated. Karas also helps heal the spirits that are injured in the human world. This anime has some forms of gore so I wouldn't recommend this anime for young children. I do highly recommend this anime to hardcore anime fans or any fans of manga."
5,No seizures please.,"Incredible fight scenes for a about 1/3 of the movie with an amazingly confusing storyline for the rest of it. The story is explained in ""Karas: The Revelation"", but that does not cut down on its intensity at all. If anything, I'd think you'd pay more attention to try to figure it out.Movie opens and closed with a fight scene. The fights are mostly cgi incorperated into an animated backround. They take the animation seriously though, from animating cold foggy breath the the rainbow pixelization that you get from touching a moniter screen."
5,So yummy You'd never think they were good for you!,"I love these Bars so much! I started doing low/no carb high protein last October 2011 to lose weight!I have lost 130 pounds since. I decided it would need to be a forever thing! It was so hard to find any protein bars that weren't still loaded with carbs When I didnt have time to cook a low carb meal. I found these bars & tried a few & fell in LOVE! Not only are they Low carb & full of protein, They are sugar free, gluten free & super SUPER YUMMY! I love almost all the flavors & they are great for on the go meals. Easy to throw in a bag & take with you. These are one of my favorite flavors. Its more like a dessert than a meal. <3 If you are doing the low carb thing & need a yummy low carb protein bar You Must try these!!"
2,not expired but tasted like it,"This is my second order of the toasted coconut carb-rite bar. The first time they were fresh, the ""chocolate"" coating was smooth and creamy. This last order appeared to be expired, old, with the outside coating powdery and dry. The expiration date was not outdated, so I'm not sure what the problem is. I opened three of the bars and they are all that way, not sure what to expect of the rest, or if I will order them again. Makes me dissapointed as I think they are one of the best bars for a low carb, high protein snack.:-("
1,Tastes Bad,"While I am a big fan of the other flavors of these bars (Toasted Coconut, Smores, Peanut Butter) this flavor is horrible. It tastes fake, almost like a cleaning product. Buy another flavor, the above review is not true."
3,"Lots of carbs, and fat and protein, not much benefit","Tastewise it was so-so, but I was surprised at the fat content. There was a fair amount of protein, but I would say it was not a healthy bar."
3,Carb Rite Cookie Dough,"The product has a sweet flavor and perhaps tastes a bit better when chilled. Initially the sweet ""cookie dough"" taste was enjoyable enough but as I went through the box over a period of time it lost some of that appeal. Not my top choice in the protein bar category, I would say that the 12 pack should be spaced out over a longer period of time so that one doesn't become cloyed by the flavor."
1,don't give this a second thought,"Not even edible ! Against my usual shopping pattern of not trying unrated products - I had a weak moment and paid the price. This and the Doctor's Rasberry Truffle are about $40 straight to the trash. I wanted to find sugar free sweets so I bought about 10 different items. 1/2 were okay, will not re-order but can eat them. These two Doctor's bars are HORRIBLE. One bite from each to try & 23 14/16 bars right to the trash.Unfortunately cannot return to Amazon and called Doctor's customer service and was told nothing they would do about it. First Really Bad experience on Amazon - and felt I had to write a review and help my fellow shoppers."
2,"I've had worse, I've had better","I've been on a low carb/low calorie diet for a couple years now so I've tried quite a few food items. I picked up these CarbRite Chocolate Brownie bars at my local health store since they were one of the lower-priced items. I can honestly say you can tell it's a diet bar. The chocolate isn't that smooth and the taste is a bit off. I still think the 2.5 net carbs & 190 cals for my work lunch are a payoff. I try my protein bars frozen but these seem to stay a bit chewy in the center, no matter how cold. I'm already not a big fan of chocolate, so I will be trying the other flavors soon."
4,Low Fat Protien Bar,"It is hard to find the perfect Bar but this will do for now.The Bar I'd like would have the following characteristics- high protein- low Fat- low sugar or no sugar- around 200 calories- good taste- low priceThis Bar has most of these qualities except it does havea higher sugar alcohol level than I would like.I have used this product for years and am satisfied, obviously."
5,Absolutely delicious. Just dont eat more than 1...,"These took me by surprise. The packaging and everything makes it look like a product from the 80's and that it wouldnt be too good but you cant judge a book by its cover. These reminded me of the Atkins bars, but the inside is much softer and sweeter. These bars really are delicious and filling. Just dont eat more than 1 a day as they do contain a higher amount of sugar alcohols than most other sugar free bars which can lead to upset stomach or other things which would make other people not want to be in the same room as you... :)Only thing I would change about these bars is the packaging which is pretty dull, but otherwise, the bars are great. Ive tried both Smores and Toasted Coconut and both are very good. These are my favorite low carb bars out there."
4,"Not bad, just not a lot of flavor",My chocolate peanut butter bars came in good packaging & fairly quickly. I try my protein bars both fresh & frozen but here is what I wrote down when I first tried it a few weeks ago...-Not much peanut butter flavor-Smooth texture-No bad aftertaste-Only 4g fat & 2.5 net carbs!This isn't the best tasting (meaning not a lot of peanut butter to it) but it's still pretty good for a post-workout protein bar. I would have liked to try out a couple bars rather than being stuck w/ a 12 pack though.
5,One of my favorite CarbRite Flavors,"Really enjoy the CarbRite bar for taste and have come to rely on its lasting energy (which is in part one of the benefits of the fat content). For a regular-sized bar, it's actually time-consuming to eat because of its chewiness--so the satiation factor is pretty high. It's ironic when the bar is praised on taste but criticized for having a 7 grams of fat when this is largely how the bar achieves its smooth, rich impact on taste. Anyway, there are many more reasons to avoid sugar (promoting fat storage by driving up insulin, for one)--which is another thought covered by this low-carb bar."
2,Acceptable but better off without,"The texture and taste a just a bit better than the peanut butter bar. However, this bar still has a ton of sugar alcohols (21g) and a pathetic 1g of fiber, so the bloating is out of this world too. Better off without it!"
1,Product not consumable,"Since writing to the shipper didn't work, I'm grading this product a sub-zero and would give no stars if I could. The chocolate on the outside of the bars was streaked different colors of brown and the one bar I tasted was terrible. Who knows how long ago these bars were stocked. When I asked for a replacement I received no response whatsoever from Amazon or the seller. Too bad because I have tried other Doctor's CarbRite products and they were great."
1,truly horrid,"I didn't think it could get much worse than their blueberry cheesecake bars.Then I tried one of these.Taste and texture are both enough to put you off...like wet Playdoh and bad,cheap banana flavoring.I.felt bad for the chocolate coating, it was actually the onlypalatable part of the bar."
3,"Sweet, too sweet for me.","First if you are looking for a bar with no carbs this is the one for you, I did find it very sweet, to sweet to for my tests and also to chewy, but it depends what you are looking for low carbs, fat etc."
3,tasty but...,"Tasty bars but you will be in trouble after having one. Very smelly farts :(Also, I'm not sure how much of the protein was actually being absorbed by my body."
2,Not a fan of this flavor,"I like the Carb Rite brand and have tried three of the flavors so far, but this one is definitely my least favorite. The coconut one I love love love! The consistency is fine, as is the nutritional value, but I cannot get past the taste. I do not taste graham, I do not taste marshmallow - how is this a ""s'mores"" flavor? I really can't describe the taste but...not so good. I bought a 12-pack and had to force myself to eat them all."
2,Try a Different Flavor....,"I eat CarbRite bars everyday so I try new flavors whenever they are available. Banana Nut would be a great flavor for a breakfast bar but unfortunately this one tastes more like ""chemicals"" than banana nut.But try the CarbRite S'mores or Brownie flavors. Those are still my favorites!"
1,And the list of ingredients?,It amazes me to see these companies expecting us to buy their products without us having the chance to read what's in them. Are they hiding something?
4,Good flavor,"I like this one. It is not as tasty as a real candy bar, but for a sugar free (small) meal substitute, it does pretty well."
4,Good value but lesser taste,"I'm a little dissapointed that the taste isn't stronger but the nutritional facts are pretty good for a low-carb protein bar. Also, there are a few chocolate chips in the bar so it's not just plain ""cookie dough"" as the Doctor's named it.-Only 1g net carb!-Good post workout food or on-the-go breakfast-Tastes ok fresh or frozen-Not a lot of flavor but it definitely doesn't taste bad"
2,Bars arrived degraded by heat,"These bars were shipped from Phoenix, AZ, in July. Need I say more? While they are edible, the chocolate coating on the outside had turned a very light brown and the consistency was changed. They taste OK, just not as good as they do when they are not exposed to extremely high levels of summer heat. I feel it was a bad decision to ship any perishable food items from Phoenix, AZ, in the summer time. I will not order these from Amazon again during the summer but will look for a place along the west coast or in the mountains where the bars will have a better chance to arrive tasting their best. These bars are normally really good bars, some of the best protein bars around, in my opinion."
3,glycerin,"Be aware of the glycerin in these bars. There appears to be a fair amount of it. Two glycerins can be combined in the body to make glucose. There is a delayed effect compared to eating glucose directly, but it still concerns me. I'm not going to eat these bars often until/unless I come across good scientific studies which indicate that they don't have even a delayed effect."
5,Perfect Protein Bar,I really like the Doctor's Carb-rite Diet bars especially since they are high in Protein low in carb and zero in sugar but they are delicious. What else can I say I am addicted to them.
3,Not bad,"This bar wasn't awful, but it isn't my favorite of the carbrite bars I've tried. The ones I've really liked so far have been chocolate. While if someone gave me some of these, I would eat them but the smores and the chocolate peanut butter flavor are better. IMHO"
5,This audio tape is one of the best I've listened to.,"After reading ""The Celestine Prophecy"", I decided to try the audio tape on meditating. I have tried other meditation tapes, but find Salle-Merrill Redfield's voice to be quite soothing and relaxing, and each time I listen, I find intuitions about questions in my own life. I find myself drawn to the peacefulness of the forests, and have come to love camping as a result, as long as the site is of a wilderness nature. This tape has helped me to make decisions on the path I am taking in my life, and this excites me, as I have questioned where my life was going for some time, and because of this tape, I now know without a doubt. I highly recommend this cassette tape for anyone who is concerned about their future as well as that of the planet. Excellent!"
4,Her voice soothes,"Salle Merrill Redfield has a great voice for guiding a person into meditation. After listening to several simular recordings, this one stands out as a crisp, clean and soothing option. Prior to having this recording available on CD, I used the taped edition so often as it consistanly ""did the trick"", that I simply wore it out. Would be nice if she would follow up with other mediation recordings."
2,Tapes???,What am I supposed to do with a tape? Does anyone still own one of those archaic 8-track machines of the 80's?!? If it still works can I please borrow it!!
4,An interesting and fast paced read. Excellent on a plane,The book moves along at a decent clip. The characters are well though out and the 3 remaining books in the series continue the stories of the characters we meet in this first book. It is a good read on a plane or when you want to occupy your mind with something other then what you are currently doin
1,Imititation Book...Zero For Originality!,"These writers must write by committee. They're imitators, not innovators. This is a poor substitute for a BOOK. This isn't crab meat, it's imitation Krab flavored."
2,I like skateboarding movies but didnt like this one,So I bought this movie because I skateboard and like movies that revolve around characters that skate but this movie was boring and it had one character that a funny thing happened with his head every time he got angry that was real annoying. I don't know if I ever ended up seeing the end of this movie.
3,Cardio mix review,"'cardiomix'is fine. All the songs pretty much sound the same. They are laid over the same drum/percussion to keep a clear quick tempo. It isn't exactly what I was looking for, but it is just what it says - a cardio mixed group of songs. I'm not sorry I bought it."
5,Saved my Marriage!,"This book outlines tons of things my husband and I never thought to ask. We were best friends for a year dated for another year and then were engaged for another year and in that time we learned so little from each other. about 6 months before we got married a friend gave this to us. We read through it. We fought debated, compromised and learned that we could work through big issues. This book help give us a non emergency situation to talk about things. Brought up topics like adoption, birth control, fertility treatments, who controls the money, How important is being debt free to you, and many other topics. Not things you think about before getting married but they can be heated topics they were for us. I love this book I recommend to anyone I think will be getting engaged or is thinking about marriage. It is never to soon to know WHAT YOU want. Then you can be sure you can live with the person you want to marry."
4,Helpful Stuff,"This book has a lot of good questions, although I feel my fiancee and I had already discussed a lot of them together. Some of the questions won't apply to you, but that's to be expected. Overall, it's pretty fun to go over things from this book with your fiancee."
3,"Fun book, good to have a conversation over, Author's views are weighted though.","This book is worth a check out at the library. They were obviously going for quantity though. What cracked me up is the authors have their own views on what is right and what is wrong (non doctrinal views), and their questions reflect this. It's just funny, they are leading questions, (some of them.) It's like ""Even though you're bad and wrong if you feel this way, what are your views on ________?"" Tisk tisk. Oh well, don't BUY this book, but do check it out at the library and have a fun evening asking questions or getting good questions for filtering dates out."
3,Eh...it's OK,"I bought this book out of a whim, and when I was looking through it, I realized that I had already asked these questions to my boyfriend (soon fiance but now husband). Essentially this book is telling you to just KNOW the person before you get married to them! Who would of thunk?"
4,Fast Delivery!,The book is just what I needed and the description fit the actual condition of the book perfectly. I appreciate the transaction and hope to work with the seller again.
1,Seriously?,"Wow - I cannot believe that this book is in print or that anyone would pay money for it. While there are some good questions in it (that you could probably think of yourself), there are a lot of really offensive, irrelevant, and ridiculous questions. There are a couple of questions which are extremely racist. Some of the questions were so ridiculous that they made us laugh. Others were downright offensive. Yes, there are some good questions to ask before you get married - but probably not 300, and definitely not the ones in this book."
3,ok,"one was a nylon bone that i really didn't think my puppy could chew, but he did and i was watching him! he just did it so fast. the edible bones just go too fast, they don't lasts even five minutes, not worth the money."
3,not for strong chewers,"The edible ones, my dog ate within 5 mins. The durable plastic ones, my dog loves, he chews on them for months. Would not recommend the edible ones to strong chewers as they are consumed quite fast."
3,Chew Chew,"Nylabones are great for chewing puppies. This kit is definitely a ""starter"" and helps you gauge which stage Nylabone you should offer your puppy. Our puppy ate the inedible first-stage bone as well as the edible one. We learned that the white bone is the only one she couldn't immediately destroy."
2,Nylabone puppy chew starter,"I don't like the way they break apart if a larger dogs bites on them. They do not smell like beef, chicken, peanut butter, or cheese so they do not get my pups interested in chewing them. What is the use of a chew toy if it is not appealing."
2,Pieces broke off the flexible bone,The flexi bone basically turned to rubble after a short time chewing. The pieces are a choking hazard. I threw out the flexi bone after an hour.
3,GREAT,"My puppy loves these bones! Definitely one of the better purchases I've made to satisfy her need to chew! The different flavors are also nice.UPDATE! 2 weeks later, she is no longer interested in the brown or white hard bones.... she gobbled up the edible bacon one.... I'm not too thrilled about the purchase anymore."
3,Fun,"Our puppies both destroyed the edible one in record time, ignored the hard white one and played with the gummy one. I would have rather had three of the gummy ones."
3,Good deal.,"Like others have said, dogs will eat the edible bone in a few minutes. My dog will chew on the brown bacon flavored bone like no tomorrow. He loves those and they do last several days for him (Chihuahua) and they were a lifesaver when he was teething. I usually buy that bone by itself.Unfortunately he could care less about the white bone in the middle. Which is why I think it's a better value to just buy the single puppy bone on the left."
2,Eh... It's okay.,"My 4-pound Bichon puppy went straight for the bacon bone, and quite frankly, she ate it so fast that I couldn't figure out where she'd ""hidden"" the bone. Turns out, she had literally devoured the WHOLE bone within a few minutes. I didn't particularly like that concept, mostly due to the potential choking hazard of a bone that crumbles that easily (she was 4 pounds at the time!).The rubbery bone did better than the bacon bone, but I ended up having to take the bone away because my pup would bite off shavings of the bone instead of eating it. This left quite a mess around my apartment, so that bone was pointless for us.The white bone has actually become her favorite bone over time. It doesn't make a mess, and now that she's a year old, she chews on it daily. So, if your pup doesn't like the white bone, hold on for a while and there's a chance that will change.I would not buy this set again, but I would be tempted to buy another of the white bones when this one runs out."
2,Dog chet tot,"I got this for my puppy, The dark brown one is soft rubber and he tore it up in 1/2 houre.The light brown one is hard but brittle. he ate it before i noticed.The white one is hard plastic and it seems safe. he's still enjoying it."
2,My labradoodle couldn't care less,"I brought Nylabones because of a friend's recommendation, but my 10 week old puppy doesn't even give these a second glance ... I haven't given her the edible one yet, but the white bone and the ""gel-ly"" bone simply lie around gathering dust."
3,My dog wasn't into them!,"These were recommended to me at the pet store. My dog wasn't really into chewing on them, however, and preferred to chew on other toys and sticks instead."
4,Be thankful!,"Great message to teach children any time of year! The only problem - the book we bought didn't have page numbers, so my son didn't know where to put the corresponding stickers."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,This book was a horrible disappointment! I give it one-star only because I can't give it no-stars! Save your money and just read the Psalms in your Bible.
1,Difficult to Read,Why did they publish this book with font and color making it so difficult to read? What a waste. Could be so much more.Sorry I purchased.
4,The Psalms of David,"Beautifully done, the calligraphy was sometimes hard to read, but the art work and the detail were lovely. The story behind the book makes it even more of a treasure for your library."
5,A treasure! A Psalter of stunning flavor! Top Rated,This book must be re-issued in print. A scholar of Medeivel Psalters will see the same passion of devotion in this 1880-1918 KJV hand illistrated psalter..The colored sketches catches India's beauty in a way only a love of the psalms would inspire.
5,A beautifully illustrated collection,"This book provides a beautiful series of illuminations, printed on heavy paper, for each of the Psalms. The pictures are gorgeous, and they provide insights and thoughtful reflections on the words. The book would make a wonderful gift, as well as a companion to a daily prayer routine."
4,Is that a bagpipe?,"First, yes, it IS a bagpipe. Though from listening to it most probably wouldn't know it. Jose Angel Hevia is such a gifted musician that he takes bagpipe playing to a new high. No visions of the emerald highlands here! :-)It is hard to put this music into a category. Though Hevia is from the Asturian region of Spain, which has Celtic roots, the music is VERY different. You hear very clearly the Celtic influences in this CD. But upon closer examination, you also hear touches of Middle Eastern, a little Indian as well as European gypsy rhythms. And, of course, Hevia lives in Spain and you hear that too! In a lot of ways this is the ultimate FUSION album.There are two tracks I suggest you listen to: ""Busindre Reel,"" and ""El Garrotin."" If you like those two songs, than you will love this CD. It is representative of what the CD is all about and the rich fusion of so many types of styles into one fabric known as Hevia! As a perveyor of World Music I highly suggest this CD!"
3,Idolo de masas,"Hevia ha conseguido lo que nadie en España habia logrado hasta ahora. Hevia ha llevado la música tradicional a las discotecas y salas de baile. Algo con lo que, aunque yo no pueda estar completamente a favor, creo que ha sido el empujón que necesitaba la música de raiz en nuestro pais. Hevia has managed what nobody else has in Spain. He has taken tradicional music to discos and fests. This is something that this kind of music really needed here in this country."
5,Tierra de Nadie/ Nobody's land,This Cd has an excellent sound. The beautiful renditions of folkloric sounds stands alone. Spanish Bagpipes at it's best.Excellent Cd I recommend it.
5,Spanish Celts at their best,"I was given this CD as a gift during my trip to Spain and have fallen in love all over again with my celtic spanish roots. The music is inspiring. If you liked Riverdance, this will blow you away. Enjoy!!"
5,Movie in the head,"Imagine you are seeing a beautiful landscape, beautiful dancing girls, beautiful horses or the ocean. This images came into my head when I heard this phantastic cd. Especially ""Busindre reel"" is one of the best instumental tunes which I have heard in the recent years."
5,Asturian fusion music,"Many of us in Puerto Rico (Caribbean) share the Asturian and Galician roots either through our ancestors or emigrants from Asturies or Galicia, so listening to the bagpipe is something you do once in a while at ""Romerias"" (communal picnics) or at family gatherings (if you're lucky enough to have a ""gaitero"" or pipe player). Hevia's music does not only bring Asturian folk music to the forefront of world-fusion music but also bespeaks of his perfectionism and richly imaginative arragements to finally create a very well executed music with fine musicians. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
4,"Good card, solid performance","It's 6600GT card, with DDR3 memory, runs solid and slick, Leadtek's top nvidia 6600 series card."
5,Great music and lots of action,My Grandson looks at monster trucks videos on utube but they are short and we are constantly looking for the next one. This DVD is great. It has lots of action and great music that keeps his attention.
5,my son loves this DVD.,"My son is 4 yrs old and Monster Truck Crazy. He LOVES this DVD and watches it over and over again. If you have a child that loves Monster trucks, he will love this movie. No voices... just Monster trucks and music."
5,Good fun!,Purchased this for my 3 year old grandson. My daughter said he watched a show about Monster Trucks on The History Channel and was so excited about them. Now he can watch them whenever he wants!
3,The Title is Right,"Tons of monster trucks. Not much else to it, but that's all that matters for my kid. He likes having this on in the background while he is playing with HIS monster trucks."
3,Lots n lots of monster trucks,It does have lots of monster trucks. They are mostly old school. Sound track is all music should have live track to make it more interesting
3,"cheesy music, old school monster trucks","I purchased this for my 3yr old, who happens to be crazy about monster trucks. This video was obviously made many, many years ago. It has old school monster trucks and cheesy, corny music. I absolutely LOATHE listening to this DVD play, but my child could care less...he still enjoys the action."
2,Just ok,"My 3 year old likes all the newer monster trucks like Blue Thunder and Monster Mutt but this DVD is really old footage and doesn't have the more modern trucks in it with the exception of Grave Digger and not much of that. The music is annoying and I can't sit and watch with him like I do with his other monster truck DVDs.You can get a better DVD then this for free when you buy a 3 pack of ""monster truck fan favorites"". Other then that I recommend spending a little more money on a Monster Jam DVD. There is a lot more and better footage then on this one and it is entertaining for adults as well as kids."
2,Kindof Lame,We DVR Monster Jam for our 2.5 year old son. I got this for when we were away from home thinking it would be similar. It has fairly lame music and even seriously some karaoke sounding stuff. We turned it off. It did hold his attention but wasn't what we were thinking at all. Also most of the monster trucks weren't the newer ones he knows the names of. Seemed old.
2,DVDr,"My 7 year old son really liked the videos, mostly cut together well to keep your attention. However, my main issue is with the quality of the disc. The disc itself is not a stamped DVD its a purple bottom DVDr someone would burn at home! No where does it it say that in description..."
2,Annoying,I thought the DVD was annoying especially the music. I was hoping for just the monster trucks doing their thing but there is all this editing and I just could not follow it very well. My 3 year old kind of lost interest in it and he LOVES monster trucks. Would not recommend.
3,Second Class Quality,"To be honest I doubt my grandson really notices or cares. For me, even though I saw previous reviewers comment negatively on the quality, I was still disappointed. To be fair, my grandson does stay glued to it when it is on. It is however easily forgettable."
2,Disappointed :(,"Alright, so I ordered this dvd for my 2 and half yr old, expecting it would be just as awesome as most all of the reviews said it was. BUT, I cant hardly even watch it without having it almost MUTE! If you dont mind heavy metal music then nevermind this comment, however, it was just waaaay to much for me. Yes, there is a lot of action...but the graphics on some of the taping of it hurt my eyes (i dont even know how to describe this part) it was electric colors flashing throughout the ""way to close shots"" of the monster truck action. But anyway, my biggest complaint is the CRAZY heavy metal instruments playing throughout most of the movie! I have enough noise going on in my household with 2 kids that I dont need crazy music screeching in my ears as well. I wish I wouldve spent the extra money on the other actual Monster Jam dvds :("
1,Waste of money!!!,"I read the reviews and thought this would be a great video for my kids ages 3 and 5. Boy was I wrong. The background music drowns out the best part-the roar of the engine. You have to strain yourself to hear it. Also, everything is in fast foward or slow motion, which kind of takes the wow factor out of the action. It's more like a music video. My kids did not even pay any attention to it."
2,My review for this DVD,"I don't want to be mean, but I'll be honest. This video is target for kids, but I think this DVD doesn't educate kids about monster trucks. There are some nice classic trucks, but this video doesn't do justice for any truck and I was hoping the annoying music would go away, but never did. I give 2 stars for monster trucks, but kids and adults will not like this DVD."
5,This is a great album,"They've just reissued the CD at an affordable price, it was 40-50 dollars. Buy it, you'll be glad you did. Twin Cadillac Valentine kills. Then find the ep Good and Gone, and you'll hvae all the Messiahs you need, their later stuff is weak."
3,Wild Blue Yonder is an i-pod worthy song,"Thanks to M. Dougherty for scanning such a great image of the album cover on to this site - I was dying to remember what the cover looked like. Their song ""Wild Blue Yonder"" reminds me of the rough, live, cool AUSTIN, Texas sound that bands like ""The Fabulous Thunderbirds"" were famous for."
5,"Not gonna pay 200 dollars for a used copy, ALT","GunShy was awesome, but I was getting tired of my Cassette tape. After checking their website:http://www.screamingbluemessiahs.co.uk/, I finally found out how to get these guys on CD.It is possible to get any of the old albums on CD for under 20.00 USD. Just follow these directions: Send an email with ""SBM CDs"" in the subject line to:kennyharr@msn.comI was searching everywhere on the web and in used CD stores. Ebay is asking close to 200 USD. I sent an email to Kenny Harris(drummer for the Sreaming Blue Messiahs) and ordered GunShy, for less than 20 USD. The CDR is very professional looking(the cover art on the CD and in the jewel case good are re-productions). I was very satisfied, the CD sounds great."
4,"works well, does the job",I bought this holder to hang 13 interior solid core doors. It worked well and was fairly priced. Solidly made for my purpose. Would recommend for a do it yourself worker.
4,Upright Alright,"I purchased the ""Trojan Frame Door Holder"" to assist in mortising and mounting hinges on 12 interior doors I am replacing. The steel is strong enough to hold most doors upright on edge while you mortise and mount hinges. With a couple of added clamps to my sawhorse it holds the door upright just fine. Good Product for the money. No plastic parts or cheap steel here."
2,An Apocalyptic Rant,"I too thought this was going to be a book in the same vein as the original, with cute quips and parodies on the Winnie the Pooh stories. I read it from beginning to ends waiting for them to show up. Instead, I endured through a rant, in a very un-Taoist manner, about how Mr. Hoff seems to think that the Human race is the apex of what the universe has been created for and now, we have ruined the happy ending.He needs to remember that whether we destroy ourselves and the world we live in is only a part of what will be a millennium of millennia where the cycle of life and death revolves indefinitely. Then, through all his badgering of poor Eeyore, he himself epitomized the Eeyore Principle by whining, taking an extreme position and judging others actions instead of accepting the world as it is, for what it is, regardless of how he feels it should be.So basically this book, through Mr. Hoff's words, is a lesson of what the meaning of Te is not."
2,Confused Reader,"I don't mean to be an Eeyore here, and I certainly don't mean to be critical, but I had trouble figuring out exactly what this book has to do with Taoism. One of the central themes I've found in Taoist and Buddhist approaches to life is that criticizing and rejecting things is a sure-fire route to unhappiness. Many of the passages in this book seem to have more to do with Dennis Miller rants than with Taoism. I found myself becoming a little more tense, critical, and rejecting reading it, in stark contrast to the reactions I have when I meditate or read Taoist or Buddhist literature. Reaching Balance is not achieved by criticism, but by acceptance and gentle redirection."
2,Huge disappointment after brilliance of first book,"I loved the Tao of Pooh when I was younger so was looking forward to reading this when I recently received it as a birthday present. However, it has little of the humour and presence of the first book and spends most of it's time being an 'Eeyore' and whinging about the world around it. If you want to feel depressed and/or pissed off about the state of the world this is the book for you. If you're looking for a book that melds Eastern wisdom with Western humour look elsewhere."
4,Piglet on meds..,I didn't find this book as lovable as Tao of Pooh. Piglet while seemingly an ideal model to learn the Te from there is alot more ranting and raving then the simple lessons from Pooh. Maybe Piglet needs a change in his prescriptions.
3,Not all sequels are necessarily good,"Since the first one was enjoyed and liked, the second was a natural. Both for Hoff to write and for me to want to read. However, maybe it was because the it was no longer a novelty or because Hoff seemed to ramble a bit more in this one, but I didn't enjoy this book as much as his last, The Tao of Pooh. Near the end it seemed to devolve into more of a litany of the sins of mankind against nature than anything else. I still enjoyed it and there was still a lot of teachings and information that I learned. Plus there is a natural growth and extension from the first book that he is not necessarily repeating himself nor the ideas. But for whatever reason, it just didn't strike me as much."
2,scratches the surface of the tao,"not as good as poohentertaining at leastmore author than taoread pooh instead!which one of the ""three vinegar tasters"" is hoff?"
5,"Loved Piglet, but Pooh was bette","This book wasn't bad, I just liked Pooh's better. Hopefully they won't make a ""Depression of Eeyore"" lol."
4,"Great book, lessons for life","Benjamin Hoff has created a masterpiece on human understanding and an inspiring view of the world as a whole. He combines Taoist theory and a sense of activism to portray Piglet, one of the world's most beloved and cherished characters, as the epitome of existence. I loved it!"
3,Good follow-up,"If you enjoyed Tao of Pooh, you'll enjoy this one too. I guess I just like Hof'f's writing style, and this is an enjoyable way to learn about Taoism."
3,Read the Tao of Pooh instead,"This book, unlike its predecessor, is bitter. It's a rage against Western Society, whose vindictive energies seemed to violate the philosophies of the ""Tao of Pooh."" I really enjoyed the first one, but I think perhaps this book gives us a more well-rounded - if sadder - charicature of the author."
1,Don't buy,"It is impossible to know what was happening in Hoff's life when he sat down to write this book. That is a personal issue for Hoff to work out by himself.What is possible to know is that this book has nothing to do with Taoist philosophy. Or Te. And this is the biggest problem. Many novices will come to the book believing, as Hoff has such a wonderful reputation from his Pooh book, that they are in the hands of a teacher of Taoist philosophy. This is not the case. Hoff spends all of his time venting his spleen, making assertions about those things that vex him.And right there - let's go no further - the book is failing as Hoff is showing he does not practice what he preaches. He is wanting only ideals. He cannot let things be as they are. He feels angry.He has forgotten the teachings of the Tao."
2,Dissapointing,"I loved the Tao of Pooh. I love Piglet. But I didn't love the Te of Piglet. This was a case of taking a great thing too far. My advice to Hoff is to write another, deeper, continuation book about the Taoist ways of Pooh bear and, as Milne did, leave the loveable cast of characters as just that, a cast of characters."
1,A sham.,"I read the Tao of Pooh and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was hoping I would find the same amount of enjoyment in the Te of Piglet if not more however I was destined for disappointment.This book speaks very little about Taoism and more about his own personal social and political beliefs. I was also offended by his complete disdain of the American Military. I consider myself a Taoist and I am also a Soldier in the U.S. Army.Everyone sees the Tao in differant ways and reading through it I see conflict a natural part of the Way. Dog fight dog, cat fights cat, apes murder one another. Conflict is just as natural as a tree growing in a forest."
3,"Good examination of Te, but vents his anger too much","I absolutly was enthralled with ""The Tao of Pooh."" So when I saw this book I snapped it up. ""The Te of Piglet"" could have been an ideal companion to ""The Tao of Pooh,"" if only Hoff could have stuck to philosophy. His rantings against everyone and everything dragged the book down. When he stuck to the subject, this boook was every bit as magical as the first. I enjoyed it, but then I skipped over the lectures."
1,ugh,"Benjamin Hoff got way out of control on this one. In his sequel to The Tao of Pooh, he rants and raves and displays decidedly un-Taoist characteristics. He spends far more time arrogantly lecturing the ignorant, unwashed masses, than describing Taoism. Although he is clearly quite proud of his accomplishments in writing the Tao of Pooh, this followup is not worthy of the first book. For a better introduction into the principles of Taoism, read Eva Wong's translation of The Seven Taoist Masters."
2,Read 365 Tao instead!,"This book was a major disapointment. Instead of building upon the foundation that was laid down in The Tao of Pooh, the author gets too emotional and rants and raves about the evils of the western world. However there still are many nuggets of wisdom scattered throughout the text. The poem included by Ko Hung is the most profound thought I have encountered in any text about Taoism thus far, and I am very gratefull the author included it here. However, the authors anger at the western lifestyle just gets in the way of his original message of contentment and happiness. Other authors such as Deng Ming-Dao, or Lao-Tsu himself are much better examples of pure Taoist thought. There is great wisdom in the author's book, it just takes too much time to sift through the anger to find it. Don't get me wrong The Tao of Pooh was groundbreaking but Piglets message of the virtue of the small in this book gets swallowed up by the authors anti-western attitudes."
2,Ugh,While some of the history regarding Confucianism and Taoism was moderately interesting the book quickly decended into the author's own political agendas. I'm only a third of the way into the book and I'm already considering selling it back to the nearest used bookstore. Such a disappointment. The Tao of Pooh was a much more interesting read.
5,A fascinating look at Eastern Philosphy,"This novel is a great introduction into the eastern philosphy known as Tao (and te). It symbolically uses the characters from Whinnie the Pooh to teach the reader about Taoism. The hero is Piglet, the short shy hero, who must learn to stick up for what he believes in. This book is also full of many fascinating POEMS and SHORT STORIES from the far east. It is a book for EVERYONE to read. I shared some of the stories in this book during my Torah reading class (it was the day we could read ANYTHING)and the stories led to great discussion. This book will teach you that Monotheism is not the only type of religion and that a respect for nature and doing what you believe in are the really important things in life. This is not a hard read like those darn pocket zen books!!!:o)"
3,Alomst perfect.,"I would suggest one reads the Tao of Poo first. It wonderfuly introduces Taoism, or atleast the general ideas of Taoism, without the need for guidence. However, the Te of Piglet takes on concepts which surely should be looked at from many more angles and be thoroughly lived instead of read. Yes, it is a good book with interesting paralels to the Characters of Winnie the Pooh but goes beyond the realities of Taoism. The author also forgets the different schools of this religeon and their concepts. I would atleast hope that a reader either takes this book as a commentary on a religion or uses it as an introduction and explore further using all the resources available. Three Stars"
1,More about Ka-ching than Tao te Ching,"This book seems to have been written solely for the money the author knew it would make. It has none of the wit and charm of its predecessor. Mr. Hoff, who often annoyingly refers to himself in the first person plural (our tai chi instructor told us, etc.), begins with the notion that anything anti-western is taoist and constructs a long and tedious screed against modern American culture. He preaches the importance of seeing things as they are and then proves himself totally incapable of separating myth from reality. It would be funny if Mr Hoff were not so pompous. The difference between The Tao of Pooh and The Te of Piglet is equivalent to the difference between a prom date and a prostitute."
1,Very Disappointing after Tao,"I wanted to like the Te of Piglet, but part of the way into it I realized that, taken to it's logical conclusion, the author laments that humanity has created tools to allow for more than just survival. There were few of the direct applications of Daoist writing into his treatise and almost nothing about Piglet, except that he was small, brave, and escaped from Owl's house after it blew over.By the time the author got to his rant on Conservatives, which we have all heard countless times, it was clear that I should have stopped with Pooh. This book was a vehicle to put forward a political conviction disguised as another opportunity to have Daoism explained through these wonderful creatures."
2,Not what I thought,"This is an interesting book and the drawings are lovely. However, you don't know what you are looking at since the explanation plates are way way too tiny to read. You'd have to take the pages and blow them up to read what is drawn. Instead of 4 plates to a page how about each plate to a page. Don't buy if you are trying learn about the horse because you can't read the tiny tiny print."
1,Not pleased at all with this purchase,"This book is basically poorly copied, difficult to view images and then a pile of text at the back that is even harder to view."
5,A true simpson fan item,"Very funny music makes you laugh with each track. ""Spiderpig spiderpig does whatever a spiderpig does"""
1,"it's ""just"" a soundtrack","If you are used to, and expecting the typical Simpsons cd: with snippets of dialog and song/music, you are going to be disappointed with this!Put it this way.... the ""Spider Pig"" track... does NOT have Homer singing spider pig!None of the Green Day stuff is on the CdOh and the ""bonus content"" is just footage of them creating the soundtrack...which is available via a link that anyone can accessWhat a big diddily disappointment."
1,are you kidding me?,"I guess the Simpsons conglomerate didn't want to pay the extra cash to Green Day and The Turtles...and perhaps was against ""giving away"" Homer's Spidey Pig...because bewteen the movie and the promotional products Matt Groening and co. will only make ten zillion dollars..total screw job..long live Family Guy!"
5,This is who we are!,"The truth behind the Bible is revealed by one of the greatest and prolific writers of the century. Believe me, you should start with ""The 12TH Planet"", but eventually you MUST own the whole line of the Earth Chronicles. Right here at Amazon.com all of these titles are available. END"
5,I love this bible.,"It is a very easy bible to read and study. It explains those hard to understand stories, words, chapters, etc., and puts it into our language."
2,Not so great to teach from,"Prior to buying this Bible I read a review that indicated it had an easy to read typeface, which is pretty important to me as a Bible teacher. Unfortunately, I found the typeface quite cramped, the print tending toward gray instead of black and overall the readability to be substandard. To meet my needs I had to purchase a different Bible with larger and sharper print."
5,Recipe for Daily Living,"I purchased this as a gift for a friend; I LOVE my Life Application Bible, and when she mentioned she could use a new Bible - this was my first and only thought.Teresa"
5,Can't Imagine Life without it!,"I just began my walk with the Most High. I was reading my Bible but interpreting the scriptures to the best of ability, which most of the time was wrong. This book was suggested by a wonderful Pastor. I read it everyday because I have yet to feel lost or like I cannot apply it to my life. Before each book, the author gives a brief historical description, the theme of the book, important scriptures, an explanation of most of the scriptures and the message that is being conveyed. No matter what you may be going through in life, this study bible teaches you how God wants you to respond to those challenges and that NO matter what you are facing, God will never leave you nor forsake you. The plans He has for you give you hope. Whatever answers you may be looking for, most of them you will find with this study Bible."
5,bible,"i wanted to get a bible for my son, it was a great price, and he loves it.. a BIG5 stars............"
2,nkjv study bible,Whoever put this bible together did a great job as far as helping believers to understand and to teach others.Whoever called it large print is out of his or her mind. It is very difficult to read.
2,King James Version Life Application Bible,I thought the print was too light and it was very difficult for me to read.
1,Disappointed by Toshiba,"We wanted a new upconvert DVD player primarily to view our very large library of VCD's SVCD's and DVD's that we have burned of photos from our travels. This player said that it would play all of those formats. (It is becoming hard to find players that still support some of our older collection) This player performed very well with our older VCD's. However with a brand new just burned DVD,we kept getting a bad disc message. After repeating the burn several times,we hooked up our old and dying player,and it worked great.The phone call to Toshiba tech support was most disappoin ting. They informed me that,regardless of what their specs on this player said, it would not play + DVD's. Their only solution was to use only -DVD's. We returned this player(thank you,Amazon--no hassle) and bought a Yamaha. The Yamaha is really super,and well worth the few extra dollars. Toshiba tech support was a big disappointment. They had no interest in resolving the problem."
4,Be aware. No Digital audio (TOSLINK) output!,I bought this DVD specifically because it sounded like it had Digital Optical audio (TOSLINK) output. But it doesn't. It only has Coaxial output! This player is not different from less expensive version SD-5000 (except blue light under the door). Toshiba customer service was useless in this matter. Everything else is good about this player!
2,No HDMI SOUND! Upconversion,"Bought @Cos.*o for $35. Player produces no sound via hdmi to either my tv or my receiver and yes they are all setup to receive PCM. Also upconversion does nothing. I see absolutely no difference when connected to my 50"" Hitachi or switched through Sony Receiver. Slow to load disc initially. Other than that works well. Taking mine back."
1,Not worth it at any price,"I bought this unit at Best Buy, and from the start I was having problems with it. Simply setting it up was the start when the device refused to give me a picture. Only upon unplugging it then replugging it would it work. One of its worst features is that it has no memory. Start watching a DVD, turn off the power, turn the power back on, and--ta-da!--you're back at the beginning. Last week, the thing stopped working all together. I never found out what was wrong. Inexpensive units can be replaced inexpensively.Currently, I'm very happy with my new Sony DVP-NS77H DVD player."
4,Amazon is the best,The dvd player is nice plays AVI's and all the other format now I can put all the avi files on one dvd and save on dvd's
4,Good all-around pickup,"guitar installed on - Ibanez S7320 (mahogany body)Overall, this pickup is VERY treble-y sounding. High gain stuff that needs a chugga chugga type sound is impossible UNLESS you roll off on the tone knob. So, that means that I would almost never recommend this pickup to any guitar with no tone knobs. However, I would highly recommend it to any mahogany guitar with a tone knob. It is well suited for rock, blues, metal, funk, and I don't know about country since I don't play any. If you're playing country on a 7 string you might as well die anyway. But like I said, it is really versatile and I am very satisfied with everything quality-wise."
4,Another Enjoyable Read by Lori Wick,"I haven't found a book by Lori Wick that I haven't enjoyed. Her stories pull you in and before you know it you are lost in their world. A Place Called Home was like that too. I appreciate that her characters live their faith, that's hard to find in many of today's stories. If you want a book that is like wrapping up in a blanket in front of a fire with a cup of cocoa, then grab A Place Called Home."
4,Enjoyable Christian Story,"This is a quick, light read that was enjoyable although predictable. It takes place in the 1800s and is a story of family relationships, adventure and romance. It has a very strong Christian theme throughout that is brought about through a Christian family, the Camerons. They took in Christine, the 19-year old girl who left her grandfather's home after he died because his business partner wanted her dead and was trying to have her killed.I liked how the author let the reader know what the characters were thinking, especially Luke and Christine as they were becoming attracted to each other. That was cute and interesting to watch their relationship develop from each of their different perspectives.--Karen Arlettaz Zemek, author of ""My Funny Dad, Harry"""
4,"A great book, but unrealistically religious characters!","This was a great book, and it's among some of Wick's best writing. It shows that faith in something can get us through anything. My only complaint is that the characters are too unrealistically religious. Otherwise, a great book!"
3,"A young woman orphaned, rescued, loved!","I found this first book of the series to be too predictable, too cut and dried and a little too sugary for good journalism compared to Lori Wick's other books. However, it still was good enough for me to finish and head for book 2. I like to know there is more intrigue and suspense and journalistic planning!"
4,Sweet romantic story,"I liked this book a lot. The main heroine is likeable and interesting. The family that takes in Christine is a loving and fun group. I smiled at the humor, and there was also excellent Christian messages throughout. There was also some suspense and danger. I recommend this book for a fun read."
5,A beautiful encouragement!,"Lori Wick is my favourite Christian author, and this my favourite book of hers! When a friend lent it to me, I couldn't stop until I owned the whole series myself! The first time I read this book, I too thought the relationships the characters had with God to be unrealistic but beautiful! From reading many more books and becoming closer to God myself, I know that this type of relationship is totally possible! This book is encouraging in all areas of christian living, and a lovely read."
5,I loved this heartwarming and charming story of love,"I first read this book when I was about 13 years old, from the first chapter I was totally hooked. This was a very heartwarming story full of love, romance, family, humor, and suspense. I've read many books, but A Place Called Home is by far the very best I have ever read. It really touched me. It's the kind of book you just can't put down and when your finished you can read again and again. This book will always hold a special place in my heart. Thanks Lori Wick."
5,Excellent!! I'm sorry I finished it!Couldn't out it down,"When I get the chance, I love to read, I find it very relaxing. I enjoyed this book very much. The way Lori writes makes you feel like you are standing in the room with these people and I enjoyed getting to know each of the characters. It was a very enjoyable book. One I am sure I will read again, and I will make sure I find the time to do it! It has a lot of Christian based principles, love and devotion and suspense, I like suspense!!. I would like to read more books like this. TV has gotten so bad, it's nice to read something entertaining and uplifting without all the gore and violence."
4,romancejunkie,"This is Lori Wick's first book, but still a great one. I love the romance and intrigue combo in my books."
5,Finally!,"I have had in my collection, this awesome EP since it came out in 1986. ON CASSETTE. For years, I have wanted these version on cd! Awesome music by an incredible artist."
2,Not again!,"Again, Jones' writing gets a full 2 stars. This collection is nothing more than fodder. NEW TUNES Howard! Come on!"
5,Essential,Great book. Awesome read. Deep insights. Anyone can read and understand this. Essential for your library.
4,Wonderful intro to the miracle of Zen.,"I loved this book! As a serious practitioner of Zen for several years, it's a joy to find such a novel and succinct book on Buddhism. The exercises alone are well worth the read.There are two points that I would like to make: 1) The author seems to believe that the Boddidharma *literally* stared at a wall for nine years (in fact this is generally agreed upon by academics as a syllogistic story). This is an unfortunate and sure sign that the author has read only the immediate surface background of Zen....2) The author speaks of ""making progress"" in their practice of Zen and of benchmarking themselves against the Ox-herding pictures as a gauge of satisfactory in Buddhism. Zen has nothing to do with progress or ""getting somewhere.""...These are fairly minor points in juxtaposition to the readability of this book. This is truly a don't-miss read!"
5,This CD is GOOD!,"I've never been a huge Christian music fan, but these guys absolutely rock! I've been playing drums and percussion for over 12 years now and that has made me extremely picky about the music I listen to. These guys have the skills though. They're a tight group. What I totally dig about this cd is that pretty much every song sounds different with a plethora of textures and feels. And they have a hopeful message which just adds to their musicalness. Kudos to the group for a great album. I already can't wait for their next major album release!"
3,Paradigm is a good song...,"... But you already knew that.... The CD was ok. Dex's writing style for the songs got boring, being that his rhyming patterns all matched ""paradigm""'s pattern (that is, loose rhyming and not strict rhyming). Other than that, it sounded like a jazz album. tracks 2, 3, 4 were my favourite. it was ok, it would have been better if they varied the lyrical content."
4,Big Band Sounds Swing Era 1941-1942,"This CD represents the tunes, but not exactly. I know that the cover says 'Version' on it, (implying the original or digitised original), but there are noticible differences in some of the tunes, indicating an interpratation by another group.This is heard when you compare with the original recording.Having said that for the purists, I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the CD, and it stays in my car CD player."
5,One of the best...,"...of many recent books on body modification and the attendant culture. Probably the best follow-up to ""RE/Search 12: Modern Primitives"" in its respectful and knowledgeable approach. Exquisite black and white photos of beautifully adorned men and women, revealing themselves in every way: their desire for freedom and transformation, their sometimes troubled histories, their quest for new identities or for exploring their old ones. I used to work in an independent bookstore whose owner would get upset with me when I stocked books like this. Let some people live in a world of banality and the everyday; the rest, rejoice!"
2,One of the first bodymod books I bought yeeeeears ago,The Customised Body is worth having in your collection. Though it is mainly pictures without any major content at all - it can sometimes just be reassuring to have it there among the more informative books to read over 'your own' thoughts and opinions of those who are likeminded on certain aspects of bodily appearance.It is also very good for those who are just 'getting into' body modification and is a good starting point for those who wish to understand more about it from the outside.The pictures are beautiful. Worth a buy but not a 'must have'.
1,wrong year and damaged because of packaging,"where's my refund notice!!!!!!!!!!!you don't deserve any stars, for this order!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Big Disappointment,"This book was so bad that I won't pass it along to friends or family. I can't think of anyone I know who'd enjoy it. It's going to charity, but only because I'll never bring myself to actually throw a book away (not even for recycling).I had high hopes for it because of the laudatory blurbs on the cover. I'll no longer trust those quoted.Gratuitous gore, pointless unresolved plot elements, and choppy writing left me glad it was so short. I should have cut my losses by page two, when you learn that the ferocious October wind comes with sunshine like July.No kidding."
1,Awful awful awful awful,"Here's a random, poorly written sentence from the book:""With the victim unconscious, he prepared the operation room, which was located in a secondary, soundproof cellar, through a trapdoor and down a flight of stairs he'd constructed, entirely by night, with extrawide [sic] berth.""Poorly written, poorly thought out, terribly silly characters, and a complete lack of any historical immersion are the best aspects of this book. It all goes downhill from there. I'd bought it as a source book on the Chicago World's Fair, but would've gotten more out of the cartoon accompanying a pack of Bazooka gum.Anyone so flap headed as this author should not attempt to take on material so macabre, it cheapens the idea of murder."
1,"Poorly written, boring thriller","This book is so hard to follow--you never really know what is happening. You have no feeling for or insight into any of the characters. The book is poorly written and full of inaccuracies about Chicago and the 1893 Columbian Exposition. I couldn't believe it when I read a passage describing the sun setting over Lake Michigan!!!!! The lake is east of the city. The sun always sets in the west!! This is a simple fact that anyone with a map could figure out. This man is from Chicago?If you want to read a good, non-fiction book on the Columbian Exposition read Erik Larson's ""The Devil in the White City."" If you want to read a well-written mystery read Sue Grafton.Don't believe the rave reviews of this book. They must be written by the author's family and friends.I'm mad I wasted my time and money on this book. Don't waste yours."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"""The White City"" is the first book I ever threw away. The characters were lifeless and boring. The plot never came together. There were too many historical inaccuracies. It was pure agony just to get through it."
1,Depressing and waste of time,"The idea of a mystery set in a worlds fair, with the excitement, the noise, the fabulous attractions really appealed to me but the author does very little to show anything positive about the fair, concentrating on the wind, the cold, the dust.I almost abandoned reading in the first pages when I realized it centered on gruesome mass murders but I found the relationship between Billy and Scurlock intriguing. With another reviewer, I found the writing style, with its unorthodox punctuation, make the story almost incomprehensible at times. The author has a strange habit of closing and opening quote marks within in a sentence when what were needed were parentheses.The needlessly gruesome, manipulative and unsatisfying ending contribute to making this book one of my least favorites of all time."
2,Confusing novel,"I got this book out of the library on the basis of the plot alone. It's not that's it's bad, exactly...I want to like it much more than I do. I can just about get around the odd writing style--I've read far choppier and more confusing pieces--it's that the book seems to contradict itself in a number of places. When Dr. Handley is first introduced, for example, the book tells us that she is gaunt and weary because since she came to Chicago she has been doing nothing but read case files and work. Later on, however, we're told that she ""wanders the streets"" of Chicago in her free time. Huh? There is another part where something happens at sunrise, but later two characters walk off ""into the night."" Again, huh?I think it could be better than it is--I like the characters but like others wish there were fleshed out and the setting is wonderful and sweeping."
2,Room for improvement,"After great expectation, I found the book disappointing. Much of it was in the book's preparation. It is poorly illustrated, often making it difficult to understand what is being depicted. It has dozens of typos and grammatical errors. I also found many of the entries uneven in terms of coverage and depth, and in some cases, such as with alternative sexuality, naive. At times the book attempts to be dryly factual and at other times it editorializes. Some of the book has been ""translated"" into American English and some of it hasn't, sometimes mixing spelling of words on the same page -- very confusing, particularly with medical terms! I did learn a few things from the book."
5,ABSOLUTELY SPELLBINDING!!!!!!!!!,"Without a doubt, Paul Ekman has provided information that is vital in order to have and maintain honest relationships! What invaluable help this information is. Thank you Mr. Ekman."
5,WONDERFUL BOOK!!!!,JEREMY VISICK IS ABOUT TWELVE-YEAR-OLD MATTHEW WHO ACCIDENTLY FINDS A GRAVE STONE OF A BOY HIS OWN AGE KILLED IN A MINING ACCIDENT ALMOST A CENTURY AGO. HE ONE NIGHT WENT BACK IN TIME TO HELP JERMEY AND HAD THE ADVENTURE OF A LIFETIME!!
2,"This book had no real apeel to me, or to anyone my age.","I didn't like this book. What 13 year old girl would enjoy it? This book is for boys, and i was forced to read it for english, why do teachers pick books like this that have a masculine outline to them? i didn't even want to finish the book. If i was a boy and i was ten, then maybe i would have liked the book."
3,The Rose of Jericho,"I found the book to be kind of wordy, and I am not used to reading a novel written in journal form. Even though I often found my self re-reading some of the journal entries in the book, having to pay such attention to detail, caused me to really read every word written, thus getting a more lasting impression of what I had just read."
4,The Rose of Jericho,"The characters in this book all have very different personalities. The main character, J.M. is set on a serious mission to accomplish great things and to make life perfect. Very determined. This book deals with relationships and learning what is important in life. Things aren't always what they seem to be. This is an excellent book with an excellent lesson as well. I will always remember the meaning behind the title of the book. I recommend this one to be put on your 'must read' list."
1,Mediocre poetry horrible music,This record does not contain any famous songs by Doors. Most of the tracks are from live concerts which i usually appreciate for their authenticity. However these songs are so weak and laughably simple that i cannot recommend it to anyoone. If you can imagine it; the music is even more amateur-dumb than the Jim's text. It is like a bad hischool band.
2,Works for 2 years then breaks!!!!!!!,We got this as a wedding gift in 2001... and this microwave broke on us while we were trying to prepare our Thanksgiving dinner party. The start button wont work...but all the other buttons work......of course
1,do not buy,We received one for a wedding shower. It overheated and shut off after 1 minute of use. We took it back. Our new one (same model) worked for about a week. Then after about 30 seconds of use it began sparking and smelled like the microwave was going to catch on fire. Terrible Product.
2,Poor performer,"Uneven performance. Started off brilliantly and I was content for the first couple months, but then it started not cooking as well, shutting off for no reason, and either over or undercooking food it had previously had no problems with....It finally died completely right after its warranty expired. The funny thing is that an ancient low powered microwave I bought around 10 years ago still works fine, albeit slowly....Oh, and by the way, Stainless looks great in pictures, but it shows EVERY fingerprint and always looks dirty, even after wiping down. Maybe it's ok for a kitchen where it's nothing more than a window dressing, but if you want a functional tool, look elsewhere. While you're at it, do yourself a favor and stick with appliance white."
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED,"I got this item for my bridal shower and have been very disappointed. I have had it 2 weeks and tonight in the middle of cooking dinner the microwave simply quit working, no power no nothing. I love the look of it but am vrey disappointed with it...it is not user friendly. Maybe I have a defected item but i am still disappointed."
2,Stops working within 12 months,"The microwave is fancy looking and works great. I've used this model for about 9 months till it died yesterday. I was warming my milk, pressed the 1 minute key, after 0.5 sec - phut !! lights went off and never came back on.As you may have seen other reviews on the internet about Emerson Microwave ovens, they only last for less than 1 year. So buy Panasonic and Sharp - They seem expensive at first but are cheapers in the long run."
1,Not happy!,"After having this item for a few months, it all of a sudden ""blew up"" while in use. However, Emerson did replace the unit for me, but they did not give me the exact microwave I ordered previously. Also, I had to pay the shipping for the new microwave. I am not happy!"
2,Short term product.,Mine stopped working after 2 years. It worked well at first and then the door broke and wouldn't close. If you can I'd recommend investing in a better brand- it will last longer.
2,Sadly - made in the U.S.A.,"When I took it out of the box one of the rubber feet fell off. I was amazed to find that the rubber feet are attached with glue and staple. Really? Shouldn't these be screwed on? Initially I was happy to see that this product is made in the U.S.A., but now I'm just embarassed. With the cheap design of the feet, I couldn't trust that the board itself was manufactured properly, so I just returned it. The last thing I want is to have the board splitting at the seams a month or so down the road. Buyer beware."
1,This item is NOT for the Novamat M330,"I am sure that this is a fine item. it is, however, NOT for the Novamat M330 as advertised, it is for the Paximat series. It cannot and will not work in the model that it is advertised for."
3,Where Do All the Children Play?,"Disregard the film synopsis. These interwined stories, from varying cultural standpoints, confront and question post-modern values. The pursuit of money to better our lives and childrens' exacts a high price. Each character determines if the cost is worth it. This film's direction, symbolism and 'message' is far from subtle."
3,It's ok,I received this product very quickly! I just think that the movie wasn't that great. Other then that my experience wasgreat!
1,Pointless,"This movie had no point. I watched it expecting something big or fascinating would happen. The description of this movie made it seem like some great masterpiece but it was nothing like the movie.The husband and wife spent the entire movie apart along with lame subplots from overseas and the daughter with the maid. The acting was good but the film just doesn't go anywhere. I felt misled by how this movie was described. You just keep waiting for some big mind-blowing experience and it never happens.This is just a film about a couple and some stuff thrown in.Nothing special, interesting or worth seeing."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!,this worked for a week and then one of the metal pieces that sticks into the outlet broke off in the outlet! i had to pry it out...
2,You get what you pay for,"This thing is cheep, but will work if you wiggle the end that plugs into your I-Pod. It's cheep, but if you wiggle it just right it will work. I watched mine in fear of over-charging."
3,So is compatible with the iPhone 3g or not?,The description says it is for the iPhone 3g and the specs say it is NOT compatible with the iPhone 3g. Which is it guys?I have no idea how good it might be.
2,Disappointing,"The packaging claims it will work with the iPhone 3G and it seems to charge, but when connected to AC power with this adapter, I cannot unlock my iPhone. This made me nervous enough that I stopped using it for my iPhone charger. Seems to be working ok with an iPod nano we have."
2,Predictable,"Any author can take a bad idea and insist on running with it. Unfortunately Ms. Smith did this with Romancing the Rogue. The premise is unlikely, the plot is too thin and too predictable, and the characters never grab the reader's interest. I've read all of Ms. Smith's books and know that she is a better writer than this effort displays. It's still an enjoyable read but not up to her usual efforts."
1,Surely Barbara Dawson Smith Didn't write this?!,"I have enjoyed Smith's books up to this one, which read as if it had been generated by a computer program, randomized with romance-novel clichés, sentence by sentence...Ms. Smith, defy your editors/publishers and take a bit of time to write your next novel. And don't allow them to write anything under your name."
4,Comical contrast at Amish vs. Hollywood Culture,"Picked this movie up at the Christian Bookstore after a recommendation from a friend. Didn't expect much in the way of theological depth, but was surprised at some of the ""faith issues"" that arise when cultures clash. I think we christians take things too seriously sometimes, but it was refreshing to watch a movie just for a silly laugh. This movie provided many laughs like some of my favorite secular movies (naked gun,dumb and dumber, tommy boy)and yet, sprinkled throughout the movie were ""discussion starters"" if you invite unbelievers to watch with you."
3,A bit on the zany side,"David A.R. White is one of my favorite actors. However, he is not one of my favorite comedians. This movie just didn't work for me. There were some redeeming moments but the most part this seemed like frivolity. If someone wanted to be harsh enough, they might even suggest this mocked on-fire Christians who are unabashedly share their faith. I don't suggest that extreme. It just didn't match David's other movies. If you're just looking for a few laughs to kill time, this might work for you. I don't have enough time to kill any of it. If you're looking for a clarion call to repentance, this one will disappoint you."
1,Quite possibly the dumbest movie I have ever seen,"We actually like David's movies, some are good (we really liked The Moment After movies) and some earlier ones are pretty cheesy, but this one is just plain dumb.Please, do yourself a favor and if you want a couple recent ones that are good to watch -- go get ""Hidden Secrets"" or ""In the Blink of an Eye"" instead. Those you will very likely find worth your money and time, but this one will have you searching your memory as to whether this is or is not the dumbest movie you have ever seen."
1,DISAPPOINTED IN DAVID AND ANDREA WHITE,"I WOULD NOT EVEN GIVE THIS STORY A 1 STAR RATING! LOVE DAVID A R WHITE AND WIFEANDREA LOGAN WHITE, BUT AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS MOVIE. HAVE SEVERAL OFTHEIR MOVIES. THOUGHT THIS WAS A CHRISTIAN MOVIE BUT WAS NOT PROTRAYED AS A CHRISTIAN WOULD DO AND ACT,MANY VERY INDECENT PARTS THAT YOU CANNOT WATCH AS A FAMILY, & ESPECIALLY WITH CHILDREN. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE AT ALL. WILL BE VERY HESISTANT ABOUT WATCHING ANY MORE OF THEIR MOVIES. WILL NOT GIVE TO A FRIENDTO WATCH OR WILL NOT RECOMMEND THEM NOT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE. BRENDA"
5,"Getting back to basics, civicly speaking","We the People, right? Well, it's not obvious anymore, looking around at the usurping of many of our rights. This book states the obvious in simple terms that we can all understand at today's hectic pace. A very good history lesson."
1,What a piece of ......,"I am so surprised that the Trivial Pursuit people put their name on this piece of garbage. I brought it home thinking that my daugther and her friends would like it and while the questions were challenging, the characters are very annoying and after the 12 episodes are done, that's it...nothing. You have seen it all. There are no other discs to buy to go with it. I brought it back to the store for a refund. Why would a company market something like that for kids, knowing that kids want to keep playing and have a different game and questions each time. Don't waste your money!!"
1,Did nothing for two of my kids in the intended age range,Couldn't finish the game with a 10 yr old and a 12 yr old. I lost one kid to a Strawberry Shortcake video. Point = Netflix.The questions were terribly easy and the characters on the DVD made us all 12 points dumber. This game is going to the good will box.
5,Stick This One In Your Beach Bag!,"""Da Vinci"" is fun and entertaining reading from start to finish. Anyone who has ever worked commissioned sales can commiserate with the nearly down-and-out yacht broker, Seth Kane, who finally gets a big one on the hook, only to discover that his real work is just beginning. The author throws just enough mystery and adventure into the story to make Seth's life suddenly intriguing. Added to the mix is Seth's pompous, loud-mouthed employer - the kind of boss we just love to hate!""Da Vinci"" is set smack-in-the-middle of the sexy, south Florida arena of flashy yachts and big money. It is a must read for anyone even remotely connected or interested in the boating business. Will our boy, Seth, get the girl? I highly recommend you stick this one in your beach bag and find out. ""Da Vinci"" is a keeper!"
1,Boaty Blather,"It's hard to believe this author has ever been closer to a yacht than one of those Kool Cigarette styrofoam Snark boats from 25 years back, much less travelled in the company of the Versaces and South Beach/Palm Beach yachties who populate his pretentious book. His protagonist ""yacht broker"" seems modeled after a used car salesman from that yachting center of North America, Hoboken. Boring. A real sleeper. Less exciting than A Tale of Two Cities to me. You want an interesting sailing book? Go to The Proving Ground... a true story that reads way better than most novels.Warning: Do NOT confuse this book with the deservedly best selling ""Da Vinci Code"" by Dan Brown."
2,A Good Reference Book,"This is a good reference book to have in your library. It is essentially a dictionary that has about four different sections. The most interesting section lists every discipline imaginable and provides brief information on each. However, there is alot of info that may be of not much interest (what an Axe Kick, Front Kick, Roundhouse is.) It may be of particular interest to those that practice and/or are interested in most stand-up fighting disciplines (Kung Fu, TKD, JKD, etc.) Not a must but nice to own."
2,Light on the time,"Watch is almost too light. The digital window is only for those who can see well. I got tires of the buttons for setting the time and not a stem. If you use a cell phone to text and not to talk this watch may be fine for you. For the older user it may become a bother to use and reset. Others will speak of the plastic screen that scratches easily, but that won't be a problem for most. I jest got tired of keeping up with the manuels and the buttons to set time."
2,GIRLS WATCH,"I bought this watch as a christmas present for a friend.(5""10 290 lbs) The watch looks like a little girls watch on his wrist this watch was small for a mans watch. Other than that it functioned as it should and arrived quickly."
1,Great looking watch that's too difficult to use,"Bottom line on this watch (which I NEVER wear anymore) is that it's great if you never leave your own time-zone. The interface to change time and dates is horrible and as a frequent international traveler this watch's features sounded very useful but proved to not be user friendly.Looks great and ""works as advertised"" but not for travelers."
2,short life span,"This was an attractive product, and I enjoyed it while it worked. Unfortunately, I only got about two weeks out of it. 30M water-resistant is a joke, because it stopped working after I wore it out into the rain. It apparently got water into the electrical system, because it stopped keeping time, and the backlight stayed constantly on until it ran the battery down. Too bad."
4,great,"this watch is awesome. i admit its not theeee best watch out there but its cheap, its nice, its accurate, and its pretty light for a stainless steel watch. the one thing i dont like is setting the date and times on the anlog and digital display. especially on the analog display. it only goes in one direction and if you miss it you have to go all the way around again just to set it correctly. but overall a great watch"
2,Lasted 12 months,"I've had Casio watches for decades and have always been pleased with them, buying new ones just because of style changes or just wanting something different. That changed with this watch. It lasted 12 months, almost to the day. Now, it randomly ""hangs up"", stops keeping analog time, and I have to take the back off and re-insert the battery. It also randomly goes totally dead. I can't recommend this watch because of its poor life."
2,"Watch band is very hard to adjust, a little hard to read digital display","This is a nice-looking, inexpensive watch but Casio's stainless-steel watchband is very hard to downsize by removing links. Unless you have a really large wrist you'll probably have to take it to a jeweler to remove the flat, narrow pins that hold the links together. There are no instructions in the Casio documentation for removing links from the band. There are instructions for removing links on the web, but its a klutzy, kludgy task. The tool used to remove round-pin links does not work with Casio links.The digital display on this watch is small but the digits display on a light-gray background that helps. The light for night-time use is a small, white-light LED mounted on opposite sides of its face, not the glowing-background type.If I could re-size the band myself, I'd keep this watch, given its low price. But it's unwearable as is, so I'll send it back rather than have it cluttering my space."
2,Picture is not worth seeing it.,"The photo of this watch is not a good representation of the actual watch. I bought it because I liked the bright blue face. But when I received it, it really has a dull gray/blue face and is not nearly as nice as the picture."
5,Great watch!,Has all the bells and whistles and a reliable product with good looks - can't beat it! Can't live without it.
2,Not as expected,"It has everything as described, except one thing: the color.I didn't receive that bright blue as the picture shown. A great failure if the decision was based on that fact."
2,Not what I expected,"This watch is very cheaply made. Not what I expected from casio. The face of the watch is plastic and scratches very easy. The band feels like that of a watch out of a ""claw"" machine at the arcade. Should have spent a little more and got a Fossil watch"
4,Comfort and Functionality,"This Casio watch is about the fifth Casio I have owned. I like them all, but some more than others. This has a more reasonable profile than other watches that have a few more functions. I like the ease of setting the alarms on this watch. It is far easier to use than the TeleMemo 30 model which has an additional two daily alarms. The only drawback is that the watchband is a little smaller than others, so it has a snug fit. This was surprising since I have other Casio watches which have longer bands, and more adjustable clasps."
3,"Good watch, but not long lasting","I bought the watch almost 5 years ago and have had little problems with it, at least until about a year ago. It acted like the battery went out on it, so I had it replaced (didn't remember the 10 year claim). Shortly afterward, the watch ""reset"" itself. Thinking it might be the battery, I went back to the repair shop. Repairman said it appeared the battery contacts weren't tight enough so he ""adjusted"" the contacts. Recently (aalmost a year later) the watch reset itself again, then last week it went out on me completely. Repairman said it wouldn't be cost effective to repair the watch, and I agree. Other than that, I like the watch and may buy another one just like it, especially at the current price."
5,Excellent watch,I looked at a lot of watches and this looked like exactly what I wanted. And when I got it I found that it was!! And the price is too good to believe. I had to adjust the watch band and that was a hassle until I figured out how to do it. No instructions for this in the manual. Look on the Internet under adjusting Casio watch bands and use a VERY small jeweler's screwdriver.
4,Great everyday watch for all ages.,This watch was easy to program and is keeping time in the analog and digital sections synced. The band is top class for this price.
3,Good price but looks and feels cheap as well.,"I rarely wear watches, but in dealing with clients who are more old-school and traditional, they would often jest that I never wore one. I just don't find them necessary when my cellphone can keep time and I always have that.Nevertheless, I bought this watch to ""complete the look"" in a business sense. I opted for a cheap watch since I will hardly ever wear it, but it doesn't take a keen eye to tell that it's not a well-made watch. The face looks great, but the band itself seems dull. It's also a bit uncomfortable, but that may just be me not being used to watches in general.It gets the job done though. I've never changed the batter after over a year. Each time I break it out of the drawer it still has the correct time."
3,"Not stainless steel, but a good watch","As other reviewers noted, the case really isn't stainless (or any other kind of) steel - it's plastic. But it's easy to set, easy to read, and looks good."
3,Casio Men's Watch,"Bought this as a more formal watch than my Timex Ironman watch. Looks great, works well but is difficult to read when in the dark or dark locations because the light is not bright enough to easily tell where the hands are."
5,Great album for a great band.,"The first time I heard smiley kids I was astonishing! It's real punk rock. The band is a mix of rancid and millencolin. The lyrics are great and the energy is high. One of the great punk hardcore bands of 90's. Sorry, so sorry that is disbanded."
5,TIGHT!,Lets just say this is some of the best punk I have ever heard! Fill in the Gaps is Awesome as well as Helping Hand and Always O.K.!!!! TIGHT!
5,Superlative historical role-play/re-enactments!,"*Justice and Dissent* provides five historical trials--Salem Witch Trials, Boston Massacre, Fuigitive Slave Law, Andersonville Prison, and the Rosenbergs--for students to re-enact in classes. Copious, easy-to-follow guidelines make it easy. This month, I used the Salem trial--my freshmen portrayed afflicted girls, accused women, Salem magistrates, ministers, and testifying townsfolk. The ""characters"" are actual figures from history and the information provided is accurate and in detail. I'm doing the Boston Massacre this week and I can't wait. I teach ninth grade U.S. history and this is the best resource I've found anywhere."
1,doggie sleeping bag,"I like the idea of the product because my dog loves to be covered up and burrow himself under blankets. Unfortunatly, the fabric the bag is made of makes loud noise when touched. The sound prevents my pup from even wanting to lay on top of the sleeping bag."
1,A simple data book rather than a strategy guide: Avoid,"It is pretty simple, I was disappointed in the book. For the most part the book is a nice looking data manual rather than a hint book or strategy guide. The book has a well written (short) section on a quick kill approach to the game, but the author lacked in his presentation of more complete hints and strategy concepts. At least the game is enjoyable."
2,Alternative manual - not strategy guide,"The official strategy guide to SMAC was a disappointment. In retrospect, I realize I should have heeded the warnings in the other reviews. The beginning is good, with nice tips on general gameplay and the various victory types, but then it reverts to nothing more than a rewrite of the game manual and online help.The Alpha Centauri strategy guide pales in comparison with the corresponding book for Civilization II, which is required reading for any Civ2 fan."
2,"Not bad, but a long way from being good.","There is some useful information about the game in here, but mainly if you want information about techs, facilities, and projects. What is really wanting are useful tips about tactics and campaign strategies. This book's format does make the information it gives easy to find, though. Still, it's a disappointment, and could have been so much better."
1,"Great Game, Terrible Guide","The paper this guide used was truly wasted and would have been better spent and more valuable if it had been used to insulate the inside of a cooler. It didn't say anything that you couldn't find in the manual, was poorly laid out[ Index wasn't even correct]and was unclear in its explanations.Bottom Line: Wait for a better guide and save your money."
2,"plenty of reference, hardly any strategy","While it's generally agreed that Prima's guides are often letdowns, the Civilization-type games have usually been a noteworthy exception to the trend. Until now.There are 28 pages (out of 320) of straight strategy. There's a useful section in the back on customizing 'modpacks'. The bulk of the rest of the book is a description of the base enhancements, techs, secret projects, and so on--all of which is available in the game with a mouseclick. (They do at least offer some suggestions on the relative values of the items.) They deemed it worth their time to include an index.What's missing is: an in-depth look at play as each faction; some hints on designing your own units (and how to get the most out of the fairly clunky unit design interface, about the only clunky part of the game's UI); and a meaningful sense of the diplomatic aspect of the game (which can be important).Mileage will vary, but compared to what Civ fans are used to this guide doesn't measure up."
1,no good - just a dump of notes on the program,This was a waste of money...got more information from the manual...usually these books are better than the manual and explain things better...completely useless...
1,Not enough information.,"This guide isn't helpful to mastering Alpha Centauri's complex worlds. I've found better strategy articles posted around the Internet, including Gameguides.com's Alpha Centauri guide which measures in at almost 340 pages.Save your money and check out the one at Gameguides.com"
1,Terrible-rewrite of info in manual-index incorrect,awful--do not buy--simply rewrites the info in the manual. The index is worthless--it gives incorrect page numbers. Pretty fold-out map is next to useless.
2,Not good,"This SG's maps are hard too read, and the stratageys are dumb. it is not good at all, although it does have cool discriptions of the techs. bottom line; unless you are a billionair, dont buy this"
5,Fabulous True Story,"I am a biography nut, and this is a beautifully told story of the two tragic Russian skaters, the one who met his death and the one he left behind.While I would not recommend this novel for a young person to read without a parent preview (for I do not morally or practically endorse as an example the way these two skaters lived their lives and made their decisions), the utter romance and international backdrop of this memoir create such a sense of mystery, unity, and exoticism... and so much joy... that is almost a privilege to read Ekaterina's version of their story.I have been a fan of this duo ever since I saw their first Olympic competition, with those royal blue uniforms, on the tiny kitchen TV in my childhood home... and now, as a woman just one month younger than Ekaterina herself, I can appreciate her as a person who's emerged reluctantly victorious over trials borne of tremendous accomplishment and love."
5,More than just skating - a love story,"This is the kind of book where you pick it up and areunable to put it down once you start. Filled with beautifulcolour pictures as well as black and white, it is a firstperson account of Katia Gordeeva's life, both on the ice andoff. While skating fans will enjoy this inside glimpse inthe world of pairs skating, EVERYONE, not just skating fanswill be able to read a love of incredible depth and scope.Many people dream of having someone who was the ""love oftheir life"" and this wonderfully romantic, though tragic,story is interesting and true. Filled with wonderful emotion,and honesty, we feel like we are engaged in intimate conversationwith Gordeeva. After one finishes the book, we fill privilegedto have shared in her wonderful life."
5,What an inspiration!,"I am mid-way through the book and already my tears have started falling. I grew up hating all the Russian skaters because they always beat our Americans. I always thought that Godeava and Grinkov were good- but I still held a grudge. When I heard the news that he had died- I felt a lot of guilt for ever disliking them. Through this book I realize how much they went through growing up in Moscow, how hard they trained for competitions and how hard it is for Katia to now skate without her Sergei. This book is truly inspirational and I wish Katia and Daria all the best in life!"
5,Enchanting,"I was in love with Katia Gordeeva & Sergei Grinkov from the moment I first saw them skating together. Their classic routines were perfect enough to win many world championships including a 1988 Olympic gold medal in Calgary Canada.Romance eventually blossomed and the beautifully matched pair were married in April of 1991. Their daughter, Daria Sergeyevna Grinkova, was born in my favorite Morristown NJ a little over a year later.Reading Katia's memories of their life and love still brings tears to my eyes.I recommend this book for its portrait of pure innocence enframed in the magical world of ice skating."
5,Outstanding,They were more then a pair they were perfection. The world loved Sergei & ekaterina you could see thier love for one and another on the ice and through this book you will see it off the ice . A heart wrenching story but one you will read from cover to cover.
5,Wow!,"I'm a figure skater, and anything that has to do with figure skating as far as books go I'm interested in. This book was very well writen and a touching story. I loved it-shows the tough life and requirements of skating as well as a real true love story! Definitely a good buy!"
5,Magnificent!,"I think that love & passion result in the best inspiration & in the case of My Sergei: A Love Story by Ekatarina Gordeeva, this holds true. I think that because of the pain Ekatarina suffered that it resulted in this wonderful book. I know that she is an ice skater, but she could also very well be a great author. She was able to convey her life so eloquently that it made My Sergei unable for me to put down.I know celebrities always pretend to be in love & divorce a couple months later, but there was obviously such a love between Sergei & Ekatarina. Iwas so nice to see them grow to love each other so naturally through reading the book. I may love reading, but I seldom cry from a book and this book truly affected me enough that I cried. Its just beautiful.I would definitely recommend My Sergei because it is charming & heartfelt."
5,A touching love story,"I read this book 4 times and reading it again. It's a beautiful story because it's true and because it's written by a person who lived through it. ""My Sergei"" captures your hearts like no other book. Read it and you will never want to put it down. Ekaterina and Sergei are a fairy tale couple the world will never forget!"
2,Sometimes good but mostly thin,"The state of literature currently: garbage. Put an emotional shell on a conclusion to have no conclusion, and you're a ""genius"" according to our esteemed literary rags and reviewers. This book has two high-quality stories, ""Of These Stones"" and ""The Yellow Jacket,"" but they are more like children's stories than the great short stories of a F. Scott Fitzgerald or Flannery O'Connor. After you read those two, you may find yourself getting sleepy... the pattern repeats. The state of literature currently: garbage. This is garbage that has a few gilded peaks before lulling you into emotive but meaningless stupor."
3,A Lover of Art History and Reading,"I was disappointed in this book. I purchased it after hearing Susan Vreeland review it, and while I absolutely loved the Passion of Artemisia and Girl in Hyacinth Blue, something seemed missing in this one. I felt like some of them were too long; I didn't like some the fictional aspects she gave to some of the artists and their lives. I guess I should say I'm glad I read it but it left me a little flat."
5,Loving reading this book...,"Susan Vreeland has become one of my favorite authors. In this book each of the stories brings the reader closeup to a famous artist through the eyes of someone who is in close proximity to them in their lives. Through this artistic device, as an author, Vreeland is able to give the reader extensive information about the times and specifics of the various artists' lives. I haven't finished the book yet. But I feel I am taking my time, savoring all that it has to offer. It is very insightful, although its mechanism is fiction based on well researched fact."
5,The Power of Art,"Susan Vreeland has said that she wants to write about the enriching and uplifting power of art and she has certainly succeeded. The seventeen stories in Life Studies explore art of the past as well as art in our own time. One of the pleasures for the reader is discovering just what well-known painting is being described - sometimes even before it has been painted and is just planned by the artist.Her writing is firmly based in research and fleshes out dryer art history we may have studied. There is a great sensitivity to the writing as Vreeland brings out the humanity of the artists and those in their lives. She has said ""Each time we enter imaginatively into the life of another, it's a small step upwards in the evolution of the human race."" In this collection, we are also privileged to enter into Vreeland's childhood with ""Crayon, 1955"" For anyone who had encouragement, as a child, to explore a new world of thinking, it is particularly poignant. A really good read."
3,Lukewarm at best,"The writing is sentimental. It is often amateurish or stilted. Still, occasional flashes of brilliance."
5,Perfect for the price,Mylec products offer an inexpensive alternative to conventional hockey equipment. I know it won't last as long but my son simply wanted to try it out. Well worth the money.
5,Beautiful!,"Beautiful music, beautiful packaging, beautiful everything!It's not often you buy a CD that you can just press play and thoroughly enjoy the whole thing- this is one of those rare gems.Beautiful taxsims, amazing music, haunting melodies, crisp percussion, all performed by master Egyptian musicians. What a treat!This CD includes a 36 page, painstakingly researched booklet- so you KNOW what you are listening to.For dancers- the drum solo at the end is perfect for class, practice and shimmy drills. The taxsims include some perfect length for performance. To top it all off, I think my heart breaks a-new each time I listen to their rendition of Ana-Fi Intizarak."
5,Value & Performance,My daughters iron died right in middle of doing laundry; much needed item delivered in record time. Absolutely delighted with price and performance of product
3,"Works ok, but the setting dial is small & difficult to turn","I picked this iron up at target. it works fine, but the setting dial is quite small and can be difficult to turn which is a bit of a pain. I'll be returning mine and going w/ a more ergonomic design"
4,Really great,"This iron is basic and works really well. It takes very little effort to get a good clean press. There is a problem, though, one that another review mentioned. I cannot see the water level. The plastic is too dark. So I usually end up overfilling it and water spills out while I'm ironing...but it irons so well that I don't mind so much.All things considered (including the very reasonable price), it's a good iron with a flaw I can learn to live with."
1,Awful,"I was prepared to really like this iron. It is from Black & Decker which is usually pretty reliable.My iron is almost exactly 8 weeks. After shutting off from time to time without apparent reason as another reviewer has said, it died two days ago. Just before it died, the non-stick surface of the iron started melting and messed up a white shirt of mine. It just is not worth one dollar of the price.I am completely disappointed."
1,Worst iron I have ever encountered,"The iron sprays hot water on the item being ironed, the user, the floor, and the ironing board. It does not balance well, easily tipping when sitting vertically, making it dangerous to use. When not in use for a few seconds in vertical position, and even while actively being used, the auto-shut-off light comes on (supposed to happen when iron is not in use for eight minutes in vertical position/30 seconds sole plate down) and iron turns itself off.Additional annoyances: you cannot tell when water well is full, the water well lid must be held open while filling -making this operation very difficult. The dial symbols are small and pale gray on white making them difficult to read. The iron makes loud clacking noises. All and all, the worst iron I have ever encountered."
2,Unsatisfactory,"I selected this iron because of the excellent reviews it had received at the time (about two years ago), but it looks like this iron has not stood the test of time. My first one lasted less than a year, and Black and Decker replaced it. I used the second one very little yet it still died in less than a year. I gave it two stars because it worked nicely during the time it worked. I'd nevertheless recommend crossing this model off your list."
1,Cracked case less than 10 months old,"This iron is junk. Worked OK for about 2-4 months, then started not getting hot enough. Upon reading other peoples' reviews, perhaps it was turning off. Then the plastic cracked during warm up, when it made a loud noise, leaking water over everything. Sputtered water over everything. I should have taken the money and flushed it down the toilet, what a waste of $30. Why is everything that's made today so crappy? Didn't even last a year. My mother has an iron from the 60's that's still going. Black and Decker used to make some decent stuff, but it seems not any more. And of course it's not even worth fixing, it'll cost more in shipping back and forth than it's worth, might as well get another hunk of junk, I guess."
1,Be very wary,"I purchased the Black and Decker F1060 which is designed exactly like the F1000. It is a great iron with lots of nice features WHEN it is together. However, the top pops off the iron. There are clips holding it in to the clear plastic area that holds the water. I am not sure if it pops off just from the heat or if it is because when you turn the dial setting it can cause it to pop off if you turn it slightly past where you should stop. It is not hard to turn it too far. My husband has re glued it twice and maybe that has messed up the settings but I iron a lot of calico since I quilt and want the setting on the highest for cotton. So when turning all the way to the highest setting you can easily turn it too far and therefore it comes apart. Poor design."
1,Leaky....,"I bought this product with high hopes b/c i associate Black & Decker with quality. This iron is terrible! It leaks water ALL over everything, the ironing board and the clothes. The area to see the water level is basically opaque and its impossible to see. This iron also turns off with some safety mechanism really quick. So while you are arranging another article of clothing on the ironing board this iron goes into safety mode and turns off, and you have to unplug and re-plug to override. Avoid this item!!!"
1,BAD......,The cloth start sticking on iron in first ironing itself. Can't see how can they actually sell such cheap products for such high price range!
1,Complete garbage,"I can't believe it. I got this after my last iron died after only a few months of use. I'll get a Black and Decker I thought to myself. Can't go wrong with that, right? Wrong! After two months it has now decided at 10:30pm to not turn on. Now I am going to look ridiculous and wrinkled at work tomorrow and I have to buy another bloody iron.Save yourself $30 and buy a different brand."
1,Waste of money!,"Don't even consider this iron....both B&D F1OOO purchased did not work, one constantly shut itself off (red light on handle) and you had to replug to get the green light (heat) and would only stay on for a short period. The other F1000 would only green light for a sort time and then shut off and not come back on. This item should be removed from Amazon."
1,Doesn't Work - Right Out of the Box!,"This iron consistently shuts itself off ten seconds after being plugged in. No amount of adjustment will make work. I followed the instructions for first use to the letter. The ""manual"" included with the iron is of no help, probably because the manufacturer knows this product is defective.The only positive thing I can say is that because this iron didn't work the first time, I am able to return it. It sounds like many reviewers were not so ""lucky."""
1,Black & Decker F1000,Iron died out in about 6 days. Would not turn on.I got exchange of the same. This time it died in 3 days.I lost money.I would strongly suggest to stay away from this product.
1,black and decker F1000,"What a piece of junk. I got this iron for my birthday about 8 months ago, it is know leaking profusely around the power cord. It's hard to see the water window and the dial is very hard to turn as mentioned by other reviewers. I'm terribly disappointing I know it's a cheap iron but I was expecting at least a year out of it. The auto off is also super annoying."
1,"Tugs, pulls & leaves funk on clothes","We needed a new iron because our previous one (also a Black & Decker) finally stopped working after about 9 years. I decided to stick with B & D, since our prior one lasted so long and because I used to associate this brand with quality. I chose this particular model because of the price and the light weight (our former one was quite heavy.) Right out of the box, the dial setting was almost impossible to turn. But considering we only use the highest setting anyway, I figured I'd just leave it set there - no worries. For about 4 months, it worked fine. Then it began to catch, tug & pull on clothes, creating even MORE wrinkles. If that weren't bad enough, it then began leaving dark residue on our clothes - apparently the ""non-stick"" finish of the plate was flaking off. What a mess.Do NOT buy this cheap piece of crap. And shame on Black & Decker - what happened?"
1,Terrible Iron,"Got this iron thinking that it would be a quality product. Won't make that mistake again! This iron did fine for about a month, just long enough that I could not return it to the local store. Then, it started dripping constantly. We followed all the directions regarding cleaning, adding water etc. NOTHING worked to keep this iron from dripping. Clothes always have water spots, then today, it just quit working, won't even turn on!"
2,Crystals?,"So I'm not exactly WHY they titled this cd as ""Crystals"" because other than some chimes, it doesn't really apply. I'll tell you what though! It is a great cd of music for a massage session. That's about it."
4,I only wish they had more episodes on tape!,"The Tigersharks cartoon was part of Lorimar's ""The Comic Strip"" group of afternoon cartoons which also included ""The Mini-Monsters"", ""Karate Kat"", and ""Street Frogs"". Tigersharks also happened to be the best of these cartoons. An action/adventure cartoon much like the Thundercats, this was about a team of super-powered heroes who fought to protect the inhabitants of a peaceful planet from the forces of evil. By the way the word on the video-jacket is not Shark, it's SARK-which is the name of the heroes' ship. ""Tigersharks: Power of the Sark"" is the first episode of the cartoon, and it explains how the team came to the planet Water-O and how they came to posses their superpowers."
4,tigersharks,"I'm a big fan of 80's cartoons and I think that the tigersharks cartoon show was awesome and they should be on the air again along with the thundercats, silverhawks, bionic six, ect. It's a shame that everything old is new again and in movies like for example ""inspector gadget"", and yet cool cartoons like the tigersharks and the others I spoke about earlier aren't in the ""new"" list. I hope that in the near future will see these cartoons reborn in movies."
1,did not work,i looked this part up and the site said it would work. i installed the part and it made my truck run even worse than it was with the bad part.
3,Melancolía,"Although it is not the best work of Ruben Blades, many of the subjects in the album, deserve to be listened to, with the heart opened to the emotion and specially to the melancholy. The subject ""Todos vuelven"", deserves special attention. You will enjoy Ruben Blades, with an important orquestación and musical adjustments that they imitate ""to the district"" music and feeling."
3,Opportune,"Tony is a standup guy. While enjoying a day at the Pride festival, he courageously takes a step against crime. Are there still men like this around? Kyra, a spectator at the event, wonders as she's instantly drawn to the hero.Tony gets a visit from an angel, and it's not long before he and his angel, Kyra, are spending all of their time with one another. That is until money gets funny and the change between the loving couple becomes estranged.Mr. Harris, do me a favor, and add some more beef to part two for me."
4,Passionate Misfortunes,Stac you had me from the first page!!! I loved it kust enough romance & action to keep me interested!! Keep up the good work and cant wait for more!!!
1,JUNK !!! DO NOT BUY !!!,"I would not have ordered if I knew this was Imation junk. I have had terrible luck with Imation media. Every time I purchase Imation media I end up with coasters. This was no different. So far I have attempted to burn 80 of the discs. 29 FAILED !!! They will not write, despite trying them on 3 different PCs and with different OSes. They are simply defective. I refuse to even try the remaining 20. I purchased Maxell locally and, though they cost more, every single one has worked. I have burnt 42 from a pack of 100 with no errors yet. AVOID IMATION JUNK !!!"
3,comment for disc we brought,"Goods received promply but the packing was no good. One box was broken. Forturely, no disc come out from the box."
3,Average Price,"Bought this online, and then it went on sale at the store for same price. It's a good value if you're not finding the sales."
3,dvd stock,"Did not check format, had to buy new dvd writer that was DVD+r capability.Dvd stock good on compatible writers, otherwise, it will be rejected by DVD-r writers."
1,dissapointing,"I record dvd movies as a hobby and am always looking for better media, software etc.- I'd been using Ridata for some time w/ next to no coasters but figured I'd upgrade and go with memorex this time around. Big mistake. They skip, pixelate and freeze up. I have had to recopy at least 5 out of the last dozen or so movies I've done. Were it a compatibility issue I could understand, but it appears to be strictly a problem with the quality of the media. I'm going back to using my cheap disks!The lesson here is: "" If it works, dont fix it!"""
5,Memorex DVD+R 16x 4.7GB,I've never had a problem with these discs. I have always used Memorex since the 4x days and they have never failed me.
1,WARNING!!! This product 50% defected,"I usually don't post any reviews from purchases I have made, but I must warn everybody of these Memorex DVD's. I purchase these thinking it was a great deal $29.99 for a bundle of 100. As of now I have use 20 of them, were 11 of them have been defected after I've gone back to look at them. So at this rate I'm about to received 50 good DVD's and 50 coasters. These DVD's do burn fast at 16X, however, what does it matter if there defected, it's just wasting my time. I also bought the ""Verbatim DVD+R 4.7GB 8X DataLifePlus White Inkjet Printable."" I've use 12 of these, and quality is superb, and NO COASTER here. A little slower, but at least it is not wasting my time."
1,"Unstable over 4x , don't even try 16x",I bought a batch of these from Comp USA. When I first started burning DVD's I used Memorex. I've since switched to Verbatim & Fuji but these were on sale so I gave them a try. I guess I should have checked the first DVD but since I used Memorex before and didn't get any errors I assumed everything was OK. I burned over 30 before something caused me to check one and sure enough it didn't work. When I checked the other 30+ plus I burned they didn't work either. It was obvious then what the problem was. I tried several at different speeds and 4x was the fastest speed I could reliably burn at. I use an NEC 3450a 16x DVD burner and I know not all discs will burn at maximum listed speed but this is too big a gap. I'm sticking with Verbatim.
3,insufficient Packaging,"The box I receved did not have enough air bags to protect contents. I received a proken spindle. Luckily, I had a spare."
1,NH-USA,"Don't buy this for use in an HP computer. After I had a problem making a replacement DVD for my HP laptop the official comment from HP was as follows:I need to inform you that HP do not recommend using Memorex andTDK discs as it is not compatible with any of the HP products.Not my words, words from HP."
1,Bad media - Many coasters,"I usually buy 50-100 pack DVD media bundle since i backup a lot of data and movies. I must have burned over 300-400 DVDs to date. I have had no issues with TDKs or Verbatims (Verbatim being my favorite).With these Memorex DVDs, i have lots of issues like coasters, unable to read the discs, etc. When i look at the back of these discs, i realized many of these blank DVDs have defects close to the outside ring of the discs.I will contact Memorex on this to get a replacement of my bundle. i am very disappointed with this brand."
1,Over 50% fail rate,This brand used to be really good a couple of years ago. I have been buying them for at least 2 years. Recently they have been getting worse and worse. In the past year they have gone from a 5-10% fail rate to over 50% fail rate. Don't waste your money on this brand unless you are badly in need of coasters. Out of a 100 pack I got at least 50 coasters. The low price I paid actually turned out to be quite expensive when you consider that fact that less than half were usable.
1,Horrible fail rate...,This product has horrendous fail rate. I've only gone through about 30 out of the 100 dvdrs and I'm getting nearly 40% fail rate. That's a horrible product. It's like you're actually only buying half of the 100 stack. Will never buy this again! So mad.Memorex DVD+R 16x 4.7GB 100 Pack Spindle
3,DVD+R Discs Received,"The 100 pack of DVD discs were not packed in the shipping box with sufficient packing material to prevent damage to the plastic case that holds all the discs together. Fortunately, none of the discs have scratches or cracks so far."
2,Get your hammer or microwave ready...,"Previously to this batch, Memorex has been the most reliable disks for my machine so I bought 200 of these. So far, only one works out of about 5 that I have tossed (or broken with a hammer, I'm so peeved). I'm waiting for the 6th in row to go belly up right....about...now! Yup. I have too many coasters as it is...The 7th worked..."
1,BAD SHIPPING PACKAGING!,"I ordered three 100 quantity spindles from Amazon - or whomever actually shipped them in Amazon's name. They were appropriately shipped free HOWEVER the packaging was TERRIBLE! The three were placed in a much too large box and cushioned with only a few air pillows. Consequently, all arrived with the caps dislodged and/or cracked and discs damaged from not being properly guarded against movement. The price is right, the undamaged discs work well, but the packaging upon shipment guarantees damage. These heavy objects MUST be better packaged preferably with peanuts or almost anything that can restrain their movement. The air pillows used are much too flimsy for the weight and will, as my shipment did, break and deflate thereby offering absolutely no protection."
1,They burn but don't play,I can burn them but they do not play through.It is hit or miss with them because I have purchased them before and they worked well but this batch doesn't work.Pay a bit more and get better quality.
2,DVD backup,Memorex is hit and miss with failure rates. This pack seemed to of had a lot of failures in it. Go with Verbatim. (don't pirate)
1,"Really bad, should be 0 stars",I have tried about 6 of them and none are even recognized in my iomega dvd burner or RCA dvd player/recorder.All other brands of DVD+R 16X work without any problems.Looks like some lots are really bad.
4,Hardly any record failures despite the inexpensive price.,Don't shy away from these because of the price. I record a lot of DVD movies and these have performed well with very few failed records.
2,bad quality DVDs,I made some home movies in HD. These DVDs skipped a lot and I had to give them away. What a waste of 30 dollars
2,Shockingly unreliable for a brand name.,"It might be that I got a bad run, but at least half of the roll of discs I bought were pre-made coasters. I'll never get Memorex again."
1,100 coasters only 21 cents each!!,I thought this was a problem that had more or less vanished 10 years ago. I've used about 20 of them and haven't had a completely successful burn yet.
1,Blank Dvd,None of the disk were broke on arrival. All disc did work properly. Good for making your own dvd's or using for files.My orginal review was a 1 star. Since it won't let me change it. Now I'm telling you it was a 4 star.
1,Waste of money & time,"Memorex had been a good brand until they started selling the 100 packs wrapped in white plastic that you can't see through, must have switched to a different manufacturer. Twice I've bought these and used them on two different computers and experienced a 50% failure rate on both. Not good. Not good at all."
1,WARNING - THESE DISCS DON'T WORK WITH MACS,"Don't bother trying to use these DVDs with a Mac, they won't work. I foolishly bought two spindles of blank Memorex media - CDs and DVDs - and not a single disc in either pack works. It's not my optical drive that's the problem, because other brands of media do work in my machine. So again, if you have a Mac, a Macbook, or a Macbook Pro, don't buy these discs - you'll just be throwing your money away. I've had very good luck with Sony products and will go back to using them exclusively."
1,MEMOREX DVD BLANKS ARE BUNK,"i bought this 100 pack of dvds and every one so far does not work in any dvd player. I have used TDK, FUJI, Staples and several other kinds of dvds and have never had this problem. Do not buy these dvds they don't work. I would try to return them but is it really worth it to get my $25 back after paying S&H."
2,Bad item,"I do not like this item because it says it is a 16x DVD but when I put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x. Something is wrong with the DVDs because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner. So if you are looking for 16x, do not buy this one!"
1,Terrible Discs!!!,I have used TDK and Verbatim discs with no problems. With these discs I only get about 50% that pass verify! And who knows how long they last????Stay Away..I will!!!
1,rip off,"this listed 100 pack of 100+r dvds, well i got 1 dvd-r, so i will have to watch out for sellers like this one! thought i was getting a deal, i sure did, a raw deal! this is first time in years of ordering off amazon i am disappointed!"
2,Memorex discs disappointing,"The order was received promptly and in good condition as advertised.Though no fault of the seller, the Memorex DVDs themselves were very disappointing.Many would not write and about 20 of the 100 were out of balance and could not be used due to the shaking and vibration while spinning. Again, this is a Memorex problem, not a seller problem."
4,No Problems for me,"I'm always buying Memorex Dvds whenever I need them. I've just a few that didn't work, but that's with any brand I buy. The picture and sound is clear. Will continue to buy them."
2,blank DVD's,I have gotten this product several times and have found that every other DVD is NOT usable. My machine comes up with a recording error. SO out of 100 this time only 53 work. THe last batch was the same except only 22 of those worked. What a waste of money. I WILL NEVER AGAIN BUY MEMOREXC blank DVDs' again.Amazon should check these out and tell Memorex their stuff is defective.
1,DO NOT BUY,"I have had trouble out of Memorex before, so I knew better, but I could not resist the price. So far I have had trouble out of 50% of these DVDs. I will NOT buy a Memorex product EVER AGAIN."
4,cheap dvds,a brand i have used along with others for many years and found them at a good deal too he he
2,Not good results,"I burn a lot of data CD's and DVD's. Was not having a problem until I purchased a 100 Pak of these and I've burnt about 15, had 6 that said it burnt but didn't. I'm throwing the rest away. Beware."
2,shipping problem,The product was not packaged correctly and by the time I received it the spindle had broken and about 1/3 of the discs were scratched up as a result.
2,DVDR Review,The case was broken and the dvd's were dirty. I was disappointed with the status of the item.
2,"DVD+R Very Bad, DVD+R DL even worse","I've used Memorex products in the past and considered the brand more-or-less reliable. This review applies to a 100-disk spindle. The disks fail turn burn more often than other products. However, a laregr issue involves inability to burn at higher speeds and resulting disks that freeze and skip consistantly. Its bad on most players and worse on others. A 50-disk spindle of Memorex DL disks won't play in 4 out of 5 DVD players I've tried - again consistently. I'm switching to Verbatim as a standard."
5,Wonderful value!,Great value and high quality!! Order these on a regular basis for my DVD movie creations for my dance studio.
5,No real problems,"I've had one or two discs that couldn't be read in my computer, but overall, I've had no problems with these DVDs. I will definitely purchase them again when I need more."
3,Quality not what it used to be,"A lot more defective discs than there used to be. My experience of late has been that manufacturing standards seem to have slipped. I've tried different brands and they all seem to have a lot more bad discs on the spindle. The service from Amazon was great, but I've thrown a lot of the discs away."
1,cheap,"Cheap crap, less usable space than comparable discs, difficulty burning things that are easy on other discs. High percent of unusable discs."
1,CRAPTASTIC,"I have used this type before and since the price was good, I ordered from Amazon. The order came in a box that was way too big; bubble wrap stuffed in a corner of the box; spindle BROKEN and discs all over the box. I called Amazon, they were great, sent me a shipping label and the next day our UPS driver dropped off the replacement and took the defective package. When I opened the LARGE BOX (for 1 spindle)ONCE AGAIN the spindle was broken and discs all over the box. Again I called and Amazon refunded my money.Whoever packs these and ships them must not have a clue. How about using some packing tape around the bubble wrap so that it stays on and maybe the spindle won't break.I can't comment on the quality of the disc only on the horrible packing and shipping from Amazon."
1,not worth it,"I ended up throwing half of what I used because of failed burns. Tried 3 different drives, the sameon all of them."
1,memorex blank dvd's,In each pack there have been several dvd's that aren't any good. Too many bad discs in my opinion
1,Buy only if you want coasters!,These discs are horrible. We've tried them in 2 different brand burners. Approximately 25 out of 50 have become coasters.
1,BAD PRODUCT,"WE ARCHIVED OVER 180 NEWS STORIES ON MEMOREX DVD'S. THE NEXT DAY THEY WOULD NOT READ AT ALL. ACCIDENTLY SOME TDK'S GOT MIXED IN AND THEY WORK GREAT. I SAW THE REVIEW ON THE QUALITY OF THIS PRODUCT BUT SINCE BEEN USING MEMOREX PRODUCTS FOR YEARS I IGNORED IT. MY MISTAKE. WHEN EMAILED MEMOREX THEY SUGGEST TRY BADCOPY FROM DIGITAL RIVER TO FIX IT, WELL IT DIDNT WORK EITHER."
5,A Scathing Commentary War and Man,"Mark Twain himself said, ""In this document I have told the absolute truth and only a dead man can do so. It can be published after I am dead.""Recommended reading for politicians, preachers, military types and any thinking person. I once sent a copy to the President, Vice-President, Joint Chiefs of Staff and every member of Congress and the Senate."
3,A book you'll love or hate,"The War Prayer is Mark Twain's premier anti-war poem. Doves will love it; hawks will not - it is not a piece that will change anyone's mind on the ethics of war. It does, however, provide a moving illustration of how our prayers for our welfare are also prayers for the destruction of others. It recognizes that it is human nature to refuse to recognize the destructive side. It reminds one of the gap between recognized ideals and our actual conduct.The drawings by John Groth add to the text but do not overcome the impression of a printing that was thrown together carelessly and quickly to meet political goals in our current crisis. Quality of production aside, it is worth while to see this side of Mark Twain's writing regardless of your views on war."
5,Should be required reading for politicians,"This short book should be required reading for all politicians. While there may be valid reasons for starting a war, the unintended consequences are not always considered, including the impact on families and the innocent. We should all temper our patriotism with a little dose of reality."
1,Bad Book,"I purchased this book after skimming it over in a local store. I wish I had taken a closer look at it. I just came off a 2 week break from work and school. During my break I decided to work on a new model and following along with Mr. Steed's book. This turned out to be frustration hell. The methods in his book are fine if you are into wasting alot of time. Boolean and splines to make a simple character like the one in his book actually doubles your work. You wind up wasting more time cleaning up the errors from following his tutorial. Why he didn't demonstrate the way MOST people in the industry model, which is box modeling, is beyond me. He basicly tries to reinvent the wheel. I found much better tutorials for FREE on the web. Save yourself from learning bad modeling techniques. I happen to also know that Paul Steed DOES NOT model the way presented in the book. This should raise a red flag or two."
3,A very extensive book but hard to follow...,"This is a great book from Quake 3 legend Paul Steed and its incredibly detailed with sujects that range from pencil designs to skinning plus many other helpful tips and tricks along the way. Unfortunatelly the book fell short in the illustration department and its kind of hard editing every vertex, line, face and edge on a 1500+- polygon model with confusing black and white pictures. Atleast for me, a beguinner that doesnt understand edges very well. All in all this is a very complete guide from beguinning to end but unless you have nerves of steel or completely understand how to handle edges without relying too much on the illustrations i wouldnt reccomend it for everyone."
2,"not great, but not the worst either","I got this book 2 years ago when it was hyped as being top notch for learning 3D modeling. On the postive side it is easy to understand and gives you a good idea of the entire process of making a character rather than just jumping around and trying to explain a hundred different unrelated things like other 3D modeling books. The bad part is that the modeling technics are a bit dated and backwards. A person who posted a previous review mentioned that he uses wierd modeling techniques like booleans and splines instead of regular box modeling, and that is the truth. He also wastes A LOT of time turning edges. If you model in quads (4 sided polys) to begin with, and then teselate (triangulate) then its all done for you automatically. And as mentioned previously not much time was spent on the concepts of uv unwrapping and creating the image map."
5,"Review of ""Modeling a Character in 3DS Max""","""Modeling a Character in 3DS Max"" by Paul Steed is by far the best book I've ever read on low poly modeling. I recommend this book to any newbie to low poly modeling. It is easy to follow and Paul Steed explores just about every way to model from using primitives, to using the booleen operation effectively. Go ahead and give it a try!"
3,Written For Max 3,This book gets frustrating at times because of the fact that it is mostly written for 3ds max 3. I have 3ds max 4 and some of the things in the book are different. For example: It tells me to make a sphere with a radius of 4.0 units and I did that......well I look at the illustration and my sphere looks nothing like the sphere that is in the illustration. That is just one of the problems I had. This book would be better if he added more concepts for max 4. He should of written it like: For max 3 users make the sphere 4.0 units; for max 4 users make the sphere 2.5 units. That is just a suggestion. The layout of the book is well layed out I agree but I am just suggesting to the author to review his book with a max 4 interface...
4,Entry level modeling on Max,"I found this book to be very well written and easy to understand, for the most part the book will take you by the hand in modeling a character (using 3Ds Max 3). If you are a total newbie you will find this book easy to comprehend and follow wish in my opinion will set some foundation for you if you wish to buy and read more advanced books on the subject. On the downsize the book does a little attempt to explain texturing a character and doesn't go in deep in the process of designing the textures of the characters. But all in all a pretty nice book for entry level character design."
3,"cute, if predictible Regency.....","others have summed up the storyline well so I just wanted to add that this shorter (218 pages) Regency-while enjoyable, was certainly nothing special. From the brooding Captain, to the sisters (sensible Eldest sister Emma , Vain, Beautiful Lucy, Bookish Agnes, and the ""heart"" of the home, and heroine of the story, Chloe), to the storyline-marriage of duty, etc-everything in this story is something I'm sure you've read before, if you've been reading Regencies for any amount of time.While enjoyably written, the reader cannot help but feel that something's missing. I've read another Regency by this author,Brighton Road, that was more enjoyable, so I'll try this author again, but I wouldn't recommend this particular Regency unless you can get it cheaply.2.5 stars."
4,How to Identify Plants,Very helpful for reviewing terms that are used in taxonomic literature devoted to plant identification.
5,Save your money,"If you're like me, you need this book for class; don't waste money on a new copy, it hasn't changed in half a century (literally). It's mostly just a glossary and any copy will do. I actually recommend an old copy as it will likely have useful notes already jotted down for you."
4,Plant Identification Guide,The guide is a bit old but goes over basic plant morphology with simple sketches. The book is very systematic and comprehensive. The book should still be of great value to beginning botanists.
3,Not exactly what I expected,"This book has very detailed descriptions and definitions of the parts of plants used to make an identification, but does not provide an easy way to identify an unknown plant."
5,Must read for Western enthusiasts,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am pleased to add it to my bookshelves, along with Dearment's books on Bat Masterson and George Scarborough. Dearment's writing is scholarly, fully footnoted, and draws upon a variety of sources, some of which must have been astonishingly difficult to unearth. The focus on gunfighters keeps the story lively, and the action is put in a historical context that provides a vivid picture of life in the Old West.I am taken aback that the first reviewer of the book describes it as ""tedious,"" while otherwise praising it. I consider it a good read and appreciate Dearment's meticulous scholarship."
2,4hrs.of fun and bam!,MY GRANDSON WAS SOOOO THRILLED WITH HIS NEW BOAT CRUISING ON THE LAKE BEHIND THEIR HOME AND THEN POW!!! THE REMOTE FAILED!!! MY SON SEEMS TO THINK IT WAS FAULTY TO BEGIN WITH. CAN WE POSSIBLY GET A NEW REMOTE???
4,fast rc boat,"great, fast boat, but when a nut at the end of the drive came off, no extras were supplied so i had to buy a new one. 15-20mph."
5,Teaching kids about the joys of small business,"This book came to me in a bulk lot of old books. My copy has seen better days, but the story is enduring. Mr. Shaw is a wonderful character who values being his own boss. It is a triumph for small business and is also a great way to help explain to a child why their favorite store went out of business, which can be traumatic for any child. It is a fun read, aside from the ""sh"" factor, but just for kicks, when people visit and want to do something for my child, I give them this book to sit and read aloud! I wish this book would come up in a more general search. What a great find and a childhood treasure."
5,THE best antibacterial soap,"Tea tree oil has been known for centuries as an all-purpose natural remedy. You can use it as an antiseptic for cuts, insect bites, poison ivy, and fungal infections. This soap is mild, pleasant-smelling and is almost as effective as straight tea tree oil without the harsh smell. It's wonderful."
4,Whimsy and Magic,"A refreshing and delightful tale of a young boy mesmerized at the prospect of airplanes and the wonder and possibilities within. In 1962, at the age of 8, he finally gets the opportunity to live this dream and board one of these silver creatures of the skies. His rather amazing mother chooses to go from Newark to Los Angeles, via the Propeller One-Way Night Coach, which leaves at 9 p.m. with stops in Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Chicago, Des Moines, Denver and Las Vegas, arriving in Los Angeles at 3 p.m. Due to an unexpected snowstorm and other twists and turns, the flight actually takes them much longer - with everything sparkling with magic and newness and wonder - and some truly amazing people along the way. Written as a children's story, I know of several little boys who will probably wear this book out."
4,Nice story,"As someone who grew up around aircraft her whole life, I can understand how the boy in this story feels. John Travolta has written a nice story about a child's first airplane ride. I felt like I was experiencing it for the first time again!"
2,I didn't get it,"I saw an obvious beginning, but there was no ending, and no real ""point"", was there? I got the point about simplicity, but was that all Travolta was trying to say? I just didn't really understand what this was supposed to mean. I couldn't recommend this one. Sorry, John. Try again. I'll wait for it."
2,"Money talks, talent doesn't matter","I had to give Mr. Travolta 3 for effort, other than that I must say that this was a waste of an hour that I could have used to work on my own manuscript.It is obvious that the only reason that ""Propeller One-Way Night Coach"" was published was because of who the authour is, and therefore it would obviously would sell because he has millions of fans.I personally was very disappointed, because I believed that since Mr. Travolta has obviously read many books, scripts, screenplays, etc. for his movie roles he would have had a better understanding of what makes for good reading."
1,Save Your Money,"This book is so poorly written it should never have left the editors desk without being covered with red ink. John Travolta is a wonderful actor, but would benefit greatly from lessons if he should want to continue his ""writing"" career."
3,Propeller One Way Night Coach,"I bought the book for my nephew and read it first. It's a cute,adorable,adventure for young aviators and airplane lovers! Great illustrations! I enjoyed the picture on page 8 of the engine, also the OAG book on page 38! I'll need to tell my brother to explain Hollywood Mom and late night coffee with Harry! Fasten your seatbelts and turn on the reading light overhead for this cute book!"
2,It was just OKAY,This was a cute book at best...not very much of a story...even for a child. My 8 year old didn't really enjoy it and his is the age that the book is targeted towards. I highly doubt that if this book had been written by anyone else that it would have ever have been published. Better luck next time John
2,Unfortunate disappointment,"I would not classify this book as a fable for all ages. I doubt it would hold the interest of the very young or imaginative child. It was a sweet gesture from father to son, but I doubt had the author not been John Travolta that it would have received the attention that it has."
2,"Not great, see-thru, need at least two to have any privacy","Nothing like what is pictured! Need at least two to get any privacy... lots of space between the very, very thin reeds. Not a great product but for the price what do you expect? Seems real bamboo fencing in this size (I got the 13footer) would be at least double the cost. Should have gone for that in the first place as now it seems I will have to buy another just to get the privacy I am after. I am using this on a balcony metal frame fence so it should work but if you want this for a stand alone, move along as this will not stand on it's own. All the best and happy shopping :D"
3,the thing just transparent,"Used to cover inside surface of a wooden fence, that dried out and have space between planks. Screen really decorative - will not screen anything. Even in my case one can still see between planks. Good thing - it gives kind of earthy and pleasant impression to my patio."
3,Looks great but a bit flimsy...,"I bought this fence to line the balcony of my apartment so I could have a little more privacy. I used a staple gun to attached it to the rails and it went on easily and looked great. I even trimmed the top w/ scissors so it fit perfectly. It lasted about a week before it blew off in strong winds. Luckily it stayed it one piece for the most part so when the winds calm down I'll try to staple it up again...and in more spots for a stronger hold. Hopefully that will do the trick, if not, I'll be disappointed. I'm not sure how else to make it stay other than staples. My only major complaint was the cost of shipping...it costs even more than the fence!"
1,Didn't work for us. Ended up in the trash.,This stuff is very see through. If you are looking for something to block your ability to see what is on the other side keep looking. We were trying to use it like a privacy fence but it acts more like a screen than a fence. Overall not what we were looking for.
3,Reed fencing works but not for long....,This product does hide the chain link fence around my patio but it's not well made. Although I used nylon ties to hold it up the wind wrecks havoc with it. I'm not sure it will last through the winter. It cost me $75 worth of reed fencing so no I won't replace it in the spring if it doesn't hold up.
2,too flimsy,was expecting something more substantial and covering. for the price charged for this product i could have gone to big box hardware store and got better product. only reson i gave two stars is cause it can be used but will not buy another one and will tell people beware this is not great product.
5,Works Well!,I already own this hair dryer and wanted a spare. It's lightweight and easy to travel with. Does a great job drying my hair. Would highly recommend it.
5,Great Watch !,"This is my 3rd Casio watch and I love it with all the functions, and the seller expedited the shipping which was great, and I will do business with this seller again!C. Bey"
4,Best value for the dollar,"This is what I call my ""everyday"" watch and I've had it for well over 3 years now. The battery still hasn't been changed, the strap looks like the day I bought the watch and it runs like new. The bezel will scuff over time like any watch, as will the crystal. However, not one speck of lint has gotten inside. The only drawback is that it loses 30 seconds a month (Malaysia movement) and if you don't keep it in sync regularly, you'll have to reset the analog hands each time you reset the digital time (meaning pressing down the button for a little bit, and don't mess up or you'll have to do it all over again). The dual time zone, chrono and alarm features are a good bonus. Can't be beat for $30!"
4,"Nice watch, cheap band","I love the watch, although the band is cheap. Easily replaceable though.The stopwatch is a bit of a pain. The same button is used for start/stop and reset (hold it down for reset). Fortunately I don't use it at all."
3,Speed it up abit please,I bought this to listen to while commuting to work. I think it was a good choice and has been much more informative than listening to music or the radio. The content is good but the narration is mediocre with too many long pauses at inappropriate times. I tended to drift off the subject during his pregnant pauses.
2,Buy the Real Things,"If you're an avid reader of Reader's Digest Condensed Books, you might like this collection. Otherwise, go to your library's self-help section and check out the real things for a better taste of each book before buying them. With 50 Self-Help Classics you're getting the author's take on each publication and so you have to remember that his opinion is prevelant throughout each chapter. Having studied some of these texts in grad school, I found some of his opinions (although valid) lacked depth and understanding. It's easy to tell which books are his favorites and which ones he added just to come up to a total of 50."
5,Very Enlightening and Insightfil,"Whether you want a better understanding of what ""self-help literature"" is or just want a great read, this one does it all. I am very grateful for the author."
4,Good intro to the library of books but missing something,This is worth reading if you are into the classics of self help but its a little light on real content. Not sure what I expected but while it is okay I struggled a bit with it. On the plus side it has many classics I have never read but only heard of and that is good. It is an easy read in that it is small chapters and you can read one in your spare time and stay motivated. Worth the price of admission.
5,Great overview,This is a great book as an overview. The author did a nice job of summarizing each book. If you want to dig into more detail you can do further research on an author or read their books.
3,Kindle formatting is a mess,"I bought the Kindle edition of this. While the paper book may be good, the Kindle addition is a mess. Paragraphs are broken, words are split, leadering letters are on a line by themselves. It was clearly never proofed in Kindle format; just a PDF of the book converted without any checking.So while I think I may like the book, it's really hard to read as a Kindle book. And you'd think someone would take more care for $9.99. I think I'll just order the paperback."
2,Get the originals,"Maybe it is the sound of the narrator... or the blank one liners that are supposed to be Chapters... I don't know but I personally could not get into this audio book. It does not have the flow like an Earl Nightingale audio does; a flow where you feel you are being spoken to. No, I just felt uninspired, which is a great shame. I often caught myself thinking over the narrator, bored with his voice, wondering what was on the radio."
4,Good Summary,"This book offers a good summary of the classics listed. So if you want to know what the gist of the book was about before you purchase the whole thing, buy this one. Happily I have most of them already."
3,Not worth the usual price,"This CD is out of print and as such some are charging upwards of $100 or more for USED copies. There are honestly only a couple good songs on here. Hit that Perfect Beat which can be found on various compilation albums and as a CD single for much cheaper and also on various digital music stores. Also the album title track ""Truthdare Doubledare"" had a catchy beat.Wait for it under $10 if buying used. It's not worth ""collector gouge"" prices."
1,Really a P.O.S.,"It never worked right from day one, but I was to slow to return it. Can I give it a minus rating?"
4,Good product,Good for the price. I have twisted on them very hard and there are no signs of rounding off. Not Snapon but does the job.
2,Kind of disappointed,"The picture of this item looks alot better than it looks in real life. With words like ""hand carved"" ""Christian family"", and ""unique"" I thought it would be heavier, and not so fragile, and flimsy. It may be hand carved alright, but it still looks kind of dollar-storeish to me. Save your $20."
2,Gabels LIme,"It's fair, not great. Initial aroma is strong artificial lime, kind of like a Lime Life Saver. This aroma fades pretty quickly. The stuff is fairly refreshing to use, a pretty good bracing feel when you splash it on. After the artificial lime essence fades, the remaining aroma is mild and kind of chemically. I was hoping for mare with this product, it's inexpensive compared to other lime aftershaves-now I know why."
4,Very nice after shave,"Very pleasant lime odor. Seems to be somewhat diluted, for it doesn't provide the brace which usually accompanies the application of after-shave lotions. Nevertheless, I like it."
5,One of my favorite reads!,"Almost ten years ago, I was reading the Wall Street Journal and saw a story about this woman who was approaching 100 years old and was just listed as a top author. Her story intrigued me---taking a community writing class and being encouraged to finish the story. I HAD to buy her book. It DID NOT disappoint. I felt as if I was right there with her as she described her young adult life and all the challenges she faced, how she perservered to overcome them. A beautiful story!"
4,valuable insights for families of alcoholics,"Her memory is impressive. The physical stamina and spiritual strength she posesses are awesome. One of the most valuable parts of this book is the documentation of life with an alcoholic and the toll it takes on the individual family members. This book , especially the middle chapters, could become a tool in the recovery process. Her straightforward, unpretentious, guileless style legitimizes the credibility."
2,You get what you pay for,This is a inexpensive watch with a lot of different settings.PRO: Low cost for many functionsCON:You cannot move the hands backwards to adjust for changing time in various time zones. You can only move the hards forward which is a big waste of motion. Poor design.
1,useless; try the O'reilly LDAP System Administration,"check out page 67 of the book for a basic reason why this book is useless:an entire page of a ftp session downloading openldap. huh? How is this helpful? getting the right version of BerkeleyDB and installing it, or installing and configuring OpenSSL would have been far more helpful to me.This is another book composed mostly of cut 'n paste from the man pages, header files and varous scripts you can find with google.Discussion on basic topics such as replication skips over key steps, examples for many issues are not provided or are hidden in the book. I use LDAP at work and I used the O'Reilly book to instal, configure and use OpenLDAP. I have yet to find a question that Deploying OpenLDAP can answer that I can't get faster with google."
4,modern overview of ldap,"I've read some of the other LDAP books out there and have always complained that they are a bit dated. This book covers modern features of LDAP, reinforces the standards, and is easy to read.This book covers more recent RFC's that are typically not even mentioned in other references. It also encompasses both commercial and open source solutions to problems of scaling, standards, and interoperability.Multiple solutions to problems are given for your benefit. Multiple programming languages are covered to make this a complete reference."
3,A Good Introductory Reference,"Tom Jackiewicz's ""Deploying OpenLDAP"" provides a good introductory reference to the world of the LDAP administrator, and has a few gems not seen in previous works. While this book contains the usual discussions on compiling and installing the OpenLDAP server, as well as some sample code using implementations of the LDAP API in various languages, it sets itself apart with its detailed treatment of mundane but critical topics such as the LDAP Schema (with reference material on hard-to-find information like a listing of every attribute syntax code and what it means), as well as thoughtful best practices advice. While this is not ""the only LDAP book you'll ever need"" (there is no such thing, and probably never will be -- the topic is way too broad and ever-changing), it is a valuable compilation that can be recommended for every directory admin's library."
1,virtually useless,I was looking for a good treatment of not just what decisions need to be made (I knew those already) but realworld examples I could build on.Pages and pages of command line switches and API does NOT get OpenLDAP deployed.
4,Very nice!!,"I bought this CD because of the song Boondocks, but the rest of the CD is done very well, so now I listen to the CD for some of the other songs as well!!"
5,Great record,"I haven't enjoyed a record this much since ""Rumours"" by Fleetwood Mac. Excellent songwriting and beautiful performances."
4,Excellent!,"I got my CD in less than a week and in prestine condition. Plays perfect, thank you!!Rubie Ochoa"
1,Little Big Town/The Road to Here,I was not really happy with the selection. Only a couple of good songs. All of the CD cases were smashed & broken.
2,Could be Much Better,Pretty lightweight when compared to Alan Jackson's or Vince Gill's latest offerings
3,It was OKay,"This album has a few good tracks. I wish I had been more familiar with the songs before purchasing it. I like a few of the songs, at most four, and the rest of the songs I didn't need."
3,Disappointed,Most of the songs on this CD all sounded about the same. I basically bought it for the song Boondocks and wasn't happy with the other songs.
5,Proud of Jimi,I bought the CD to support Jimi and his group. I can remember his many performances in high school. I am glad he is living his dream. The album is great. I listen to everytime I get in my car.
4,Little Big Town - the Road to Here,"Wow! Fleetwood Mac---but better. I bet FM wishes they had written ""Bones"". And if anyone doesn't dig ""Boondocks"" they must love opera--or hail from a part of the country that thinks southerners are a bunch of illiterate hicks...oh well, if that's what you wanna think. (""I feel no shame"")"
5,The Road To Here by Little Big Town,This group came out of no where for me. I love their music. A great listen while traveling.
5,Best CD in a long time,I have listened to this entire CD too many times to count. The harmony is absolutely fantastic. This had got to be the best CD I have purchased in years. It's well worth the money.
4,Little Big Town,Little Big Town rocks! I think that the comparison with Fleetwood Mac is definitely justified. Boondocks is some good ol blues ridden country and by far their best song. I would recommend this for anyone looking for some original music even if you dont necessarily dig country.
5,Terrific Album Every Song is a Hit - Best Group Out There,"Their 4 part harmony is so tight, it is hard to tell who is who. they sing effortlessly together. they don't even need musical instruments - they sound wonderful with or without. this group is going to be around a long time. i can't wait to hear more from them. i predict they will win awards in the near future. come on people lets help them make it in the tough industry. spread the word and buy their music and don't forgot to request them on the radio stations. Little Big Town - Rocks Country Music - A Legend in the Making.:)"
5,Practical!,"I loved this book and know that I will continue to reference it in years to come. Ms. Barnier gives you some very practical suggestions for teaching various subject areas. If you have a child with ADHD, this is a must read!"
5,Great ideas!,"I saw Carol at a Homeschool Convention and the book covers her talk but in more detail and also gives a hard copy so as to make it easy to refer back to and remember. The book is good for all kinds of kids, not just ADHD. It's a great resource for the homeschool parent. It's also encouraging to know I'm not the only one who's kid has climbed on the refrigerator."
5,Microsoft Windows Live OneCare,Excellent. Bought for my daughter for college. Simple for her to use and keep updated.
2,Ultimately falls short of expectations,"About 400 pages into this 500 page book, things start to get interesting.The problem is that the first 4/5 of the novel is highly repetitive and unimaginative. I was intrigued by the premise and all the possibilities it might offer, but the author focuses on a minute idea and pounds the reader over the head with the same themes so that it ultimately feels as if he never explores the real meat of the idea. At times, you literally feel as if you're reading the same scenes you had 50 pages before.Even when things get moving near the end, our characters are mere passive observers who fail to take an active role in the action with one exception. However, this moment is glossed over so quickly, that it might as well never have happened.If you don't mind passive characters, predictable plot points, deus ex machina, and bridge, this novel may hold your interest for the duration. If not, you could probably skip it."
2,"Too long, too negative and too boring","This book would have been better if it was (1) half as long; (2) a bit more positive; and (3) a little less verbose. The premise of the book is eye catching: how would ""secret"" Jews survive in a world ruled by the Nazis. The book, however, spends far too much time and far too many pages endlessly discussing such ""fascinating"" things as the bridge playing social activities of some of the characters. It would have been a much better book if, instead, it offered more insight in how this horrid alternative reality could be changed. Moreover, the ending, while seemingly positive, really isn't. All in all, a disappointing effort for an otherwise excellent author."
2,Mundane world of 21st Century Reich,"When first reading the synopsis of Turtledove's new book, I was interested: a Third Reich existing into the early 21st century? Has to be good, right?Well, not exactly: Turtledove does give decent allusions of the imagined world around the Reich, but almost never reaches beyond the mundane suburb-to-downtown Berlin commute. Indeed, I found the two primary male characters on the same bus and train too many times not to be painfully evident.Don't expect an epic tale of fascist/Jew struggle: this novel merely states repetitive worryings and bickerings of a few children and bland adults."
1,Turtledove's worst?,"I've long complained that Harry T's best work was in singleton volumes (e.g., Guns of the South or Ruled Britannia) but he was instead writing unending series. This book is the counterargument which completely disproves that idea.""Presence"" is a complete story in one fat book, no sequel needed to finish the story. It is also as boring as all get out.If you're interested in reading long prose descriptions about the game of bridge (the bridge column in the newspaper is much more interesting), or in reading clumsy dialog of an even clumsier seduction, or just dealing with Turtledove's unending pedantic voice, this is for you. Otherwise, move on, and move on quickly."
3,"Pretty slow, last 100 pages were the best part","It seemed as though Mr. Turtledove spent about the first 2/3's of the this novel setting up the scene, which really made for an uninteresting, and slow novel. Now I'm not one of those people that can read any kind of alternate history and enjoy it, I just can't. The writing has to be good, and frankly I just didn't think Turtledove did a very good job on this one. I finished because just when I was about to give up, it picked up and became interesting, leaving the first 200 pages behind in a hurry."
1,Harry Turtledove wrote this?,"sorry Harry..... this particular piece just isn't what i have come to expect of you.i felt like i was reading a romance novel about people who like to play cards.oh and it just so happened that these folks were ""hiding inside a society that condemns them""it was a real struggle to get thru this, and i am sorry i spent the time to read it all the way thru. i will probably be a little gunshy about picking up another Turtledove book for a while"
2,"EXTRAORDINARILY BORING BOOK , NOTHING HAPPENS","BASICALLY, THIS BOOK IS 400 PAGES OF PEOPLE SITTING AROUND HAVING CONVERSATIONS. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS BOOK. IT IS READABLE, JUST EXTREMELY BORING."
1,not so original,"Gee, an Austrian named Kurt Haldweim is Fuhrer. Can't he come up with a more original name?Or the action at the end is taken straight from August 19, 1991 in Russia where Gorbachev is overthrown and Yeltsin climbs upon a tank and asks the crowd to defy the coup.Or the hit musical put on by two producers who want to close their theatre and so put on a horrible musical. It is a success and there now many companies putting on the play.It has all the originality of a poor high school level English class assignment.Glad I borrowed it from the library."
3,Fall of the USSR as the Greater German Reich,"Turtledove likes to follow real history in his books, with an added twist. Here, he expands on one of his short stories of Germans winning both World War 2 and 3. Following a family of hidden Jews at the heart of an eighty year Reich, Turtledove uses the real history of the fall of the USSR to map out the transformation of the Reich into a more modern liberal state. It was an interesting read, took me about a day. Turtledove does go into a bit too much detail with the card games and I thought the school system mentioned throughout was a little more old German-American and a lot less of the actual German system. I am not certain if that was to make the schools more understandable to Americans or what. Interesting and made me think."
2,Not one of his best efforts,"I was very excited to hear that Harry Turtledove was going to tackle the idea of a victorious Third Reich. I have read a number of his other books and have usually enjoyed them. Unfortunately, that was not the case here. This novel tediously plods on to an unsatisfactory conclusion. The author continually subjects the reader to countless hand by hand descriptions of bridge games between two couples that are boring and unnecessary. Perhaps this would appeal to a bridge enthusiast, which I am not. It seemed like filler to me. Or perhaps Harry is newly devoted to the game and couldn't contain his enthusiasm. One of the most galling incogruities in the book is using a Jewish computer hacker to spead the rumor that an SS man is Jewish in order to help quell a Putsch. All in all, a very unsatisfactory effort."
2,boring...,"...and books on the depths of passion and sexuality shouldn't be boring. Maybe you can use this if you're new to psychology, the Jungian brand in particular. Singer's other books are much better, more relevant and less dated."
1,Not good quality !,We were disappointed in the quality of the product. The material is very thin and I am not sure it will hold up very well with use this winter.I have seen other sleds recently at local stores for about $30.00 that were larger and more substantial then this model. I wouldn't recommend this to a friend.
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this toy for my son for Christmas. When it arrived slightly more than a week before the holiday, I was completely disappointed. This sled was a flimsy piece of junk that comparable quality sleds sell for about $8-10 at the local stores . I was under the impression that it was more substantial based upon the description and the few favorable reviews that existed. I cannot comment upon the actual durability because I am returning it promptly. This is the first item of the many that I have bought through amazon that I am returning. This may be a trick, however, as the quoted return shipping charges were over $97 for this $40 sled. I'm not sure how that is possible. I was able to buy a replacement sled from another manufacturer and I am happier about the quality of this one."
2,"Highly Unlikely Plot, Very Flawed Book","The book starts off well enough but with each chapter it seems to deteriorate a little more. The plot is highly unrealistic, as is the behavior of the characters. Some guy wants to stop genocide in the world and hatches a highly unrealistic scheme to do it. Please don't waste your money on this book."
2,Boring,Hijacking the President of the United States is always a great subject to write a storyline on.In this case a conference in the infamous Wannsee hotel is hijacked by environmentalists bu as is always a plot of more sinister notions soon weeds its way into the storyline...You'll be yawning long before you finish it.
1,Painfully Bad,"I finished this book because I was stuck on a plane and it was all I had to read, but it is so bad that the experience was painful. Nothing in the book is either believable or engaging. The characters are facades with no clear motivation and the actions are simply beyond all belief. It should have been a clear indication when I noticed there was no author's picture or bio on the book jacket. I wouldn't want to be associated with this mess either."
5,No Problems,"Brand new, no problems with this product at all. Was able to us it for what I intended it for."
4,"very good effort, don't listen to the negatives","One of the earlier reviewers, Mr. Miller cannot type nor speak proper English. Do you want this man telling you what cd's to buy? This is a fine album."
2,some what of a let down,this is not one of Jacksons best makes you wonder if its why we have not heard much from him lately but he is a great song writer if you love his music go for it you may enjoy it some but you must like him a lot to relly enjoy this one
5,We didn't know how much worse it could get. . .,"""Lives in the Balance"" was released in 1986, during the Reagan years. I'm waiting for Jackson Browne to write about the Bush years, but maybe he can only stand and shake his head at ""the men who send the guns to the wars that are fought in places where their business interests run.""Like him, ""I want to know who the men in the shadows are. I want to hear somebody asking them why they can be counted on to tell us who our enemies are, but they're never the ones to fight and to die.""The album should be required listening for anyone who has not yet registered to vote."
5,One of my favorite JB efforts...,"It seems that all of Jackson's fans have a different favorite when it comes to his releases. This might be mine. His work is so personal that one of his albums might leave you cold one year, and hit you in the heart a couple years later when your life situation or interests have changed. I was directing a play for a community theatre when this came out, ""Summertree"" by Ron Cowan. I needed some music, and this record brought me ""In the Shape of a Heart"" which perfectly accented the love story in the play.The rest of the songs are more political, but extremely well-crafted and sung. JB has now had a 30-year career, and is undervalued, in my opinion. He has kept the left-leaning folk tradition of Guthrie and Seeger alive while also writing some great love songs and confessional, melancholy mood pieces that win you over in spite of yourself."
1,Typical Catholic Hate,"Wow really? What makes you think you have the authority to judge peoples' eternal destiny??That is Our Lord Jesus' job and his only! Matt 7:1 ""DO NOT JUDGE!""The holy Catholic Church has been instituted for over 2,000 years. You have no right to claim who is right or wrong."
1,Reactions in Condensed PhasesL: K,I have not seen original publications of the authors in the medium- or even in the low impact scientific journals on the subject of the book. It is obviously a compilation of available to them scientific/technical papers. I strongly recommend ignoring this compilation.
2,Machado ill-served by ubiquitous Bly,"Bly deserves credit for introducing Spanish poetry to the American audience back in the 1950s and 1960s. Machado is a wonderful poet. Unfortunately, Bly is not a terribly good translator, and the result is a mismatch."
2,Terrible Translation,Bly seems to miss the meaning of the words (both literal and figurative). It almost seems like these are his 'interpretations' rather than 'translations.'
4,More good stuff from Hollander.,"John Hollander, Powers of Thirteen (Atheneum, 1983)Powers of Thirteen is one of those ideas that sounds really rather amazing, when you think about it. This book is comprised of one hundred sixty-nine (which is, of course, 13x13) thirteen-line stanzas, with each line having thirteen syllables. Other than that, you really don't need to know anything other than that the book was written by John Hollander; if you're familiar with the man's work, you know what to expect already-- wordplay, a touch of erotic scurrilousness, diction that feels just the slightest bit archaic, but in such a way that you can still imagine someone (someone erudite, anyway) actually talking like this. As always, Hollander is a joy to read, if requiring a bit more thought and attention than the average penner of verses. ***"
3,Pretty typical worm interface fare... that definitely good!,I picked this cd up after my obsession with the label its on (worm interface recording) came to a new peak. I had just picked up an amazing cd by solar-x. This one is quite different though. The opening track starts with a cool 70's sounding piano hit and soon some really trebble-y breaks come in going crazy all over the place. Later in the song some really disjointed bass hits come in. Really cool. Other tracks in the album are similar but there is huge variety here. Some consist of just sound effects or ambient soundscapes. Overall quite interesting.. though i'd check out solar-x first if i were you. Good for fans of aphex twin/squarepusher stuff...
1,Vade Retro,"I've purchased this CD hoping to find the original songs. I couldn't be more calamitously wrong. I suggest to keep yourself away from it.CD incautamente acquistato nell'illusione di trovarvi i pezzi originali, spero di risparmiarvi una cocente delusione. Da evitare con ogni cura."
3,Mexican Recipe Picture Book,"This picture book was cute because it features a cast of animals who would fit right in East L.A. It doesn't play into negative stereotypes and instead projects a positive image. When Chato spies new mice in the neighborhood he begins to prepare a feast of Mexican dishes to eat with the mice, of course his plan is foiled by the mice. I love the voice Soto gave to Chato, ""Orale, neighbors,"" Chato purred. ""Don't be scared of me. I am a cool low-riding cat."" The acrylic illustrations are multicolored, but predominately purple and green is used and they feature aspects of the Mexican culture. I really liked the clothes Guevara dressed the animals in, it gave them personality. Overall this would be agood book in the early grades classroom because it mixes Spanish words into the text and has entertaining pictures."
2,Over rated,"Sorry, but I thought the reviews for this item over rated it. There were few if any of the suggested patterns that I would invest my time in creating. However, the technique descriptions are clear and concise so it was worth buying for them. Perhaps my sense of humour is not American enough, but at best the 'sayings' only merited a smile."
1,Actually earns no stars...,"I learned a lot from the convenient Amazon feature of allowing a peek into a book. I quickly realized that the reviewer who noted that any of the so-called-by-other-reviewers ""edgy"" and ""hilarious"" sentiments presented in this book can be put together with designs and aphabets offered in practically any other cross stitch book was correct. I'm saving my money for truly clever and helpful cross stitch books. If I want to cross stitch a nasty, bitchy or otherwise unhappy sentiment (and I'm not above wanting to do that sometimes, mind you) I don't need this book. It's lame."
1,Not subversive - just sad,"I don't own this book, but looked through it at a the home of an acquaintance. I think it's sad that people would focus hours of creative artistic effort to produce ugly sentiments. Before you buy this book, please ask yourself if what you choose to focus on, to create and display in your home, might have a subtle effect on your health, happiness, and life.There are loads of cross stitch books from which you can produce works of art that are inspiring and help to create an environment of peace, beauty and well-being. I hope you'll choose one, because there is enough hatefulness and sarcasm in this world."
5,Awesome!,The stuff is hysterically funny and the directions are excellent too. Getting it as a gift for others soon!
4,Subversive Crossstitch,I love this book. It has the cross stitch idea that everyone thinks about but now can stitch. Pretty easy stitching so far
5,Who Knew Crafting Could Be So Hilarious!,"Recently I've immersed myself in the domestic arts (knitting and crocheting, mostly) and wanted to try something new. I had bought cross stitch kits in the past, but never got far on them because I didn't know what I was doing. I always thought cross stitch was for Grandma, but I was glad to be proven wrong by ""Subversive Cross Stitch"". Witty, snarky, smart, and sarcastic, the designs in the book show that cross stitch doesn't have to consist of ""bless this mess"" and other such cliche motifs; one can even alter the very simple designs in the book to fit a phrase or theme of their liking. It's a great beginner's guide to cross stitch, and a great guide on how to make your projects your very own. I think all of my girlfriends will be getting a customized cross stitch for their homes this Christmas, and I may even make a few of the less daring ones for some family members."
5,"Counted cross stitch as you've ""probably"" not seen it before.","It is a book for someone with a sense of humor that loves to cross stitch. The patterns are simple and well designed and the pictures show beautifully framed finished projects. The only problem I see, is that the verbal content of the patterns will not be to everyone's taste. I personally think it was a hoot and ordered the book the day after seeing it at a stitching group I belong to. I admire Ms. Jackson's ability to express herself so well in floss and I fully intend to stitch several of the patterns. I would recommend the book to people with a sense of humor and long time stitchers who are bored with the sameness of the patterns that are out there. However, don't forget what the book is titled."
5,Subversiveness Rocks!!,"Growing up in a family where all the women cross-stitched large ornate pieces of art year round, I was the one who wanted to be able to sew but hated all the patterns. All the ones that were simple and easy enough to hold my attention were ""baby-ish"" in my pre-teen eyes, and the beautiful ones were too complicated. But now, thanks to Julie Jackson and her sheer genius, I too can finally finish a piece without shame! Her wicked sense of humor shines through in her creative and simple patterns that even an easily bored 20-something like myself can follow! And the finished products are always on display, rather than hidden in embarassment."
5,subversive cross stitch-Julie Jackson,I had seen a kit from this company but was unaware there was a book. It should have carried an 'adults only' warning which it did not. Plenty of very strong language. I have enjoyed working these charts. They are very easy to read. The price was right. It arrived on time and was in great condition. Thank you
5,Kick-butt cross stitch,"This books rocks my socks. I'm a novice cross stitcher and this book has some fun, basic designs you can make right away. It also has a great resource guide and other ideas to further you on your cross stitching career once you've got the basics. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to pick up cross stitching or those who are sick of stitching cutesy bunnies and flowers and such and are looking for something new and fun."
5,Great rotor and price,I have a turbocharged 2006 Ford Focus. I paired these with Hawk HPS pads all around and I'm extremely happy with the stopping power.
3,"Great ski racer, fair author",I bought this book mainly because I am a skier and racer and was interested in Bode's racing expeiences. The family history was charming but not that different from any of us that live in northern N.H. I was a bit disappointed when he spent the final chapters going on about the war in Iraq. There are plenty of books about that.
2,you get what you pay for,the cable is 14 gouge the connectors are very low quality if the price is a problem then is doing the job like every other cable
2,not worth the money,I was not impressed by this deep conditioner at all - especially for the price. I would not purchase again.
5,The real deal,"I have always enjoyed anything this author puts out either on DVD or in book format. His DVD of the book of Acts,John and Matthew are very real and true to the NIV scriptures."
5,Very Interesting !!!!!,Everyone should see this dvd. We speak at a womans shelter and we played it for them. Everyone loved it. We continue to watch it over and over. Thanks Ann
5,Great for Bible Study,This 32 minutes film is perfect for a Bible study with children or adults. Bruce Marchiano plays a convincing Jesus and the scenery is believable. Thank you.
5,Road to Emaus,"I love since the first time I saw this movie about the book of Lucas, Telling the story about the two disciples of Jesus who went walking to Emmaus the same day of the resurrection of Jesus, when Jesus found them walking sad He talk to themm as explain all things they must know in the right way, the only thing I did not like it is the mans thinking about God will. Why they show the nails out the hand of Jesus in the Wrist. and the book of Psalms said:( Ps 22:16 For dogs have compassed me: A company of evil-doers have inclosed me; They pierced my hands and my feet. ) Jesus always said this is to be acomplish of what is written in the Sciptures. But the rest of all movie is wonderful, very explainable of our Salvation through Him, I love it and I hope a lot of Churches people can see it. in the all world."
2,Road to Emmaus -Transaction was Excellent - movie not so good,Folk selling through Amazon are terrific. This movie was in content less than I was hoping for. I ordered it because it was suggested that others ording what I wanted also ordered this. It is much less of a story and more of information presented in a nice way. I will share it with others but not really recomend it. It doesn't move fast enough for the current generation and is more of just fellas walking and talking than a story with a theme.
2,"Did not realize this was a 20 minute or so picture. Expected a full-length movie. Disappointing. Poor acting, too.",I'm not crazy about Bruce Marchiano and he seems to be making a lot of the Biblical films. So I don't think I'll havemuch to choose from anymore in this category.
4,True to Scripture,True to His Word. Only 30 minutes in length. Although the story is fully told and I will be using it in Bible study.
3,Too short,"Didn't realize this DVD was only about 30 minutes long when I bought it. Still, it is a good word."
3,So-So,There are some decent photos but many of the estate's features are not pictured or even described. My advice - Look for something else.
1,disappointment,This was very slow and very confusing. I thought I would like this because of the Eagle and The Protectors were so great but this was boring. Glad I just rented and did not buy.
1,EVERY TRACK IS A VOCAL,"I wish I had known that every track on this CD is a vocal and there are no purely instrumental selections. For that reason, this CD is useless to me. I am an American doing middle eastern dance and was hoping this would be something I could make use of with my dancing, as I like the 2/4 ayoub rhythm used for the zar. The vocals will sound harsh and dissonant to the Western ear because of the untrained voices and the singing style. The vocals overpower the instrumental background music. The tracks are undanceable and because of the ever-present vocals and their style, unpleasant for listening. This CD may be useful to somebody doing an academic study of the niche in Arab culture the enclosed info booklet describes. I give this one star because of the well-researched booklet. However, I must say, it's the first time I have ever paid $16 for a small information booklet, which is what this purchase was for me."
5,Real Music!,"Very compelling music to listen to, very moody with strong rhythms. I greatly enjoyed both listening and dancing along with this CD."
2,The Bottle size is mislabeled,"I have taken this product for years but at a modest dosage like 1/day vs 2. I believe it is a nice herbal complement to my basic multivitamins. But I buy the 90 tablet bottles for like $20plus each, which this product is supposed to be, except that the fine print says there are actually only 30 tablets in this specific bottle. So folks like me can be easily misled if they don't discover the fine print. It would be a great bargain to get a 90 tablet bottle for $10 - but the print leads me to think I would get a smaller 30 tablet bottle. So I have now ordered the larger bottle from another sources. Please correct this typo - either in the title of the product or the fine print."
2,In the Clutches Of,"Hello! This is Hock. This old video was part of a old training set. Without the other fundamentals, it is not worth much at all. Instead? I would search on my name, W. Hock Hochheim on the internet and see all the new, improved material, in training order and on DVD! That is where I would spend my money. This whole subject has been reshot, redone and is so much better on DVD and cheaper too!"
4,The late Benjamin Orr's only solo.,"Benjamin Orr's ""The Lace"" #86 in '86. This is a very good solo disc by the bassist,vocalist for The Cars. I really like ""Too Hot To Stop"", #25 mainstream rock, this is a real drivin' tune. ""Stay The Night"", his big hit #24 hot 100, #6 mainstream rock and #2 Adult contemporary, kind of resembles ""Drive"" and ""You Wear Those Eyes"". Other favorites include ""Circles"", the mid-tempoed ""When You're Gone"", the upbeat ""Hold On"", the classic keyboard driven title track and the beautiful ""This Time Around"". Benjamin passed away in 2000 at age 53."
4,Great to hear Ben Orr Solo,"Im only 25 and really enjoy this CD. I bought it because I was getting back into listening to the Cars (last time was when I was 6 in the UK) and I wanted to listen to more of Ben Orr's voice. This is a great album and the slow ballads are just awesome, makes you feel like your in a 80's romantic flick, very cruisey and sexy. The track 'When your gone' sounds a little like an 80's Cliff Richard, which is good! The first track 'Too Hot to Stop' is very cool, I didnt expect to hear such a popish and rockish song from Orr...if you can watch the video for it on Yahoo, its very funny (Ben looks confined in his Flash Gordan leather). My favourite track is the single 'Stay the Night', I really enjoy everything about it. I cant provide a very good description, but if your a fan of Orr's voice, the Cars, 80's synth etc etc, get this."
4,Benjamin Orzechowski in the Spotlight,"Overall, the Lace is a decent album, but at times it sounds dated by some overwhelming synth parts and the lack of a driving guitar. Most of the songs are quite good and ""Too Hot to Stop"", ""Hold On"", and ""Stay the Night"" would have not sounded out of place on a Cars album. Orr's voice was one of the best in rock and you won't be disappointed if you like the commercial side of the Cars' music."
4,Benjamin Orr's Solo is a great show,"I bought this in 86 on cassette,due to the fact that my local record shop at the time was out of the LP.I love this album! Ben was a chief factor in the Cars succsess.He sang Just What I needed,Moving In Stereo,Drive,Lets Go etc.Many thought Ric did them uh nope.I played this tape to death.Circles is a great track as well as Stay the Night and even Lace has a good feeling to it.This album might be the sound of the Cars album if they didn't go in separate directions.After Shake It Up they took a break.Ben worked with another group of musicians and continued to tour until his death in 2000.He was a huge part of The Cars success.Ric Ocasek plays a tribute song on his latest effort called Silver.Its hard to maintain a dry eye with that song.I heard maybe that the Cars are going to regroup with Todd Rundgren. It might just be a rumour but if it turns out to be true I'm game.I'm sure with Todd it will be great.Everthing he touches turns to gold.Keep my fingers crossed."
2,Misleading Title,This book is unfortunately not about literary theory or fiction writing technique or anything of the sort; instead it is about Christianity.
4,Quality of Item,"Mailbox seems to be well made, the only fall back is the door lock is not very rigid. For the money the box is a good buy."
4,Mailbox Replacement,"The mailbox came on time. It was not made for my specific mailbox stand, so I had to drill new holes into the bottom. Despite that it was easy to install and is working much better than the old mailbox which had been hit twice by a car and could no longer be repaired by duct tape. It is a great deal for the money."
2,Dented During Shipment,"Yes, this mailbox may not rust because it's made of aluminum, but it also dents easily. The packaging was as minimal as possible. There were no packing materials other than a few pieces of paper to prevent the box from sliding around too much inside the larger Amazon box.If it had not dented during shipment, then I think there's a good chance it could have been dented easily once it was on the post."
3,Collection Not Complete,"This is a fairly good Compilation,excepting some points that need review.For one, There is too many live songs from the concert album, which did not sound as good as the songs done in the studio and of the live songs, would be better to have the studio songs. For two, There is not one song from the counterpoints album, which in my opinion is better than the Circus album, except for maybe three songs on the Circus album, which are exceptional and are Truly good Argent songs. Circus is more of a Jazz album, Counterpoints, is not quite jazz, but more modern sounds. If there were more studio songs instead of live songs and if there were some songs from the counterpoint Album, I would give the compilation 5 stars."
3,Interesting,"While I find that Rebecca Springer's ""dream"" of heaven very uplifting, there are too many scriptural flaws to believe it was an actual experience. In light of that, I still enjoyed reading the book and didn't want to put it down until I was finished."
2,condition overstated,"This book was listed in good condition, but I think fair would have been more accurate. It was yellow and smelly. Something had spilled on it and every page was stained. The book was so brittle that when I opened it to read the binding started coming apart. I would never have bought a book in such poor condition, this should have been a donation."
4,abridged version,"Within Heaven's Gates, while excellent, is the simplified abridged version of Intra Muros: My Dream of Heaven. I consider Within Heaven's Gates to be watered down, short sentences, put in modern language for readability. It loses the richness and depth of the other version from the 1800's, which I highly recommend as a life-changing book to give you eternal, Biblical perspective."
4,A scene from Heaven,Ever question what heaven may be like here is one persons picture a easy read and a great book to share.
2,A bit of a stretch,"All of the things written by the author paint a pretty picture of Heaven, but I question the accuracy of it based on what the bible says about Heaven. For example, if Heaven will be a place of total peace and happiness always, as the bible says, then how is it possible for some of the ""characters"" to be anxious or worried or lonely? All the pieces don't fit, even though I really wanted them to."
5,Source of strength,"This book is difficult to put down, I read it in one sitting. It really helps the reader to see life differently and accept the tragedies we must face with a new hope. I was given this book by a friend and I have already passed it on to my niece, who just lost her baby boy. It is so encouraging to feel that we will have an extension of our life on earth with the absence of pain and suffering."
2,Nothing to write home about.,"For years my grandmother has used the Aqua Globes in her plants so when I asked her to use this and tell me what she thought about it, I figured the reviews for it would be the same as the Aqua Globes she has sworn by. The first thing I noticed about this product was that it was considerably larger with a larger container for water so she wouldn't have to change it as much but, as I watched her read the instructions and try to set it up, I realized that more water might not be the best thing. It was rather difficult for my 65 year old grandmother to set up. Then, to make matters worse, once she did get it installed properly, it didn't fit on her planter since it's curve is too large and there is no way to adjust it. All in all? She ended up just filling up her Aqua Globe and sticking it back in her plant. I didn't blame her either."
3,Works okay. But probably not needed.,"This does work. It enables you to give your plants access to water when you are not around to water them. But it's not exactly a needed product, even for dedicated plant lovers, since it none too hard to set up your own wicking system. That would do the same job, and do it for a lot less money.So: it works. No problem. But...needed? I don't know."
1,Poorly designed,"The lid will not stay snapped shut, thus the suction needed to draw the water into the plant is not present. Could not get it to deliver water to the planter."
3,Room for improvement,Pros - it works if you get a good one and small to medium planCons- Lid won't close- does not fill pots- Defective hose- need to purcahse more spikes for larger plantsBetter off (and cheaper) purchasing the 3-pk spikes and use home bottles / containers
1,Plant Sitter Automatic Waterer,"The plastic top pops off exposing the water to the elements. Concern: doing this allows for possible mosquitoes. I use outside.Inside, it might be okay but the construction is poor."
1,Not Recommended,"Although not a bad concept, and upon seeing it you think, ""Why not? I'll give it a try,"" this item works better in theory than in practice.You can't really rely on it to keep your plants alive. I think another review said you had to siphon the thing first. That kind of takes away the ""automatic"" idea. Maybe my expectations of the product were a little too high, and my review sounds a bit harsh, but when I see automatic, I want something truly automatic.Not only that, the system is a real eye-sore.Maybe plant sitting technology is still in its infancy and hopefully it will improve in the future. I'm glad to see other users were able to get something out of the product. I wish CobraCo the best of luck and hope they can some day live up to my higher expectations."
4,Didn't work for my plant's large pot,"I held great hopes for this gadget. We have a 20-inch pot on our upstairs desk, containing a brugmansia. We needed a plant there to shade the window, but it's a hassle keeping it watered. Perhaps this would cut down our daily watering to every other day.Unfortunately, it didn't work for this purpose. The lid to the plastic container would not stay closed, so perhaps that's part of the problem. Also, the curve of the plastic container wasn't wide enough to accommodate a a pot this size. I tried sitting the container on the ground, though, and that didn't improve the function.Judging from another review here, I might be able to use the wired device in another container. But right now I don't have time to engineer that.Kudos to the manufacturer for the handy video instructions. Very clear."
3,"For pots over 8"" tall and not overly thick","The concept is a good one, however, it's a little bulky and ugly and will only work on certain pots. The system is too big to work on anything less than 8"" tall. If you have a decorative pot that has a thick rim (over 1"") or overly curved, this will not fit. I would use this for plants if I was going to be away for a few weeks, but it isn't attractive enough to have on my pots year round."
5,Plant nanny,"I am evaluating this product winter 2013 when indoor environment is extremely dry. The houseplant sits facing Southern window connected with the watering system. Instructions are so easy to follow. I fill the reservoir and ceramic sensor with luke-warm water. The system does the watering for me. In about two weeks, I re-fill the reservoir.One more thing about the watering system is that it may take a while to ""calibrate"" the system. If you notice that the water level in the reservoir does not go down, the system is not properly calibrated. Simply refill the ceramic sensor. Repeat the process if necessary."
2,Didn't work for me,"I tried this in my guest room, where I have a few plants that get forgotten. After following the directions, I put this into a pot of Emerald Gem that had been recently divided from the mother plant. It was doing great because I was remembering to water it.This watering system didn't work well. A month after installing, there was still water in the well. The plant was very droopy. I'll try again with a different plant and see if I get better results."
3,Quality needs improvement,"As many have said, the lid will not stay shut which can impact the suction through the hose. It is ok, but I believe that they could have made a higher quality version and charged more as there seems to be good demand for such a product."
1,After 6 weeks still hasn't watered my plant,In the middle of summer I received this item with the intent of using it for my 12yo Pothos plant while gone for 3 weeks. My house sitters knew I'd set this up and were told to watch the water level.When I returned after three weeks the water level was unchanged.I left it in for 3 more weeks and still nothing.I set it up exactly as was recommended and am completely unimpressed. Had to practically dehydrate my plant a couple of times to see if the water level would budge.Seriously disappointed.
5,A revolutionary guide and reference to the ultimate answer with respect to the common problem of the headache,"Relief From Headache by clinician and medical research investigator Donald I. Peterson (a retired Professor of Neurology and Associate Professor of Pharmacology at Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, California) is a revolutionary guide and reference to the ultimate answer with respect to the common problem of the headache. As the compiled results of Peterson's many knowledgeable years of study, Relief From Headache expertly explores the causes of what might relieve a headaches persistence and striking pain. Relief From Headache is very highly recommended to all readers who suffer from frequent headaches for its educational, informative and ""reader friendly"" content."
5,An Ounce of Prevention,"This book will prevent your headache before it starts if you take the time to read it and use the advice of the author. Every household should have ""Relief from Headache""."
5,Fills a gap architectural thought,"The relationship between symbolism and architecture, most specifically in the use of architectural space has been much neglected by architectural historians, probably because of its complexity and the fact that more often than not it is culture specific. This book fills a void in the field of Buddhist thought which may have been explored deeply by Buddhist philosophers but which has seldom been explained so well to general architectural historians. I welcome its publication and look forward to using it in my own research."
1,Not What You Pay For,"We compared these speakers to three other outdoor speakers. These Klipsch AW-400 speakers had by far the worst sound. In comparison to the other speakers we listened to, the sound was not clear and you could not hear sounds that were audible from the other outdoor speakers we tested. We kept the Boston speakers (which had the best sound) for use in our yard, and the Polk Audio Atrium 6 speakers for use on our balcony."
2,Mattel needs a better focus group,"This toy has me convinced that people at Mattel do not have children. It is very hard to open and close --which is annoying since you have to open the entire thing to put Lightning inside instead of just pushing him in and out of the back flap door--and it has too many useless thingies inside that break easily. When one of the car wash rollers broke off after two minutes of play, I told my son he didn't need that part. He said, ""You're right mommy. I don't."" My son is not at all interested in having Lightning play video games or work out at the exercise station. Luckily, all he wants to do with it is roll it arund the floor singing ""Life is a Highway."" I see it is selling for $50 and up. I would be cursing self if I spent that much on it."
4,"Disney Cars truck with built in ""car wash""",Easy to play with and great for small matchbox cars. Can only store a few cars inside.
4,Great Fun!,Small for the price but enjoyed by my grandson and that is the true test.I will check in stores first next time to review the true size of toys.
4,Mack Truck is fun for kids,This is a great toy for little people who love the movie Cars. It is durable and fun for them to play with open or shut.
1,not as advertised,This toy was half the size of the one I had seen in stores and was not what I had expected.Its cheap and has dozens of small choking hazards.I would not have given it as a gift if I had time to buy something else but it shipped so slow that wasn't an option. Very disappointed.
2,Don't buy this unless you are an extremely patient person,"Trying to put his toy back together is not worth the 10 minutes of play time your child will get out of it. The pieces don't snap together well, and we've found it impossible to close the truck up so that it stays, not to mention trying to fit the pieces inside the truck as it is supposed to do. It provides hours of frustration rather than entertainment. That said, my 5 year old likes it, but since it's pretty small, he only plays with it for about 10 minutes at a time."
2,Okay for a day,"After one day of having this product, my three year old son informed me that it was 'boring'. And he has not bothered with it since except to draw on it and remove all the flimsy internal pieces. The large lightening McQueen car(with sounds and a light), on the other hand, is much more used."
5,my son LOVES this toy!!,my son received this toy for his 2nd birthday and he absolutely LOVES it. he wants to bring it everywhere and it is one of the only toys that will hold his attention for a very long time.
1,Way too SMALL a toy for WAY TOO BIG a price,This can be found in retail stores for less. The price being listed here and at other online venues is highway robbery. Sure the online venues might have it in stock whereas the stores may not - but you are better off wait listing at a store than shell out this kind of $$$$ for a very small and in places flimsy toy. Buyer be warned.
2,Just Bought It,"Please note - the little play cars are not included. I bought it at one place thinking I could find the little cars someplace else. Don't buy this toy until the little cars that go with it are available. I have been to several stores and no one has them. You can't even order them on line! My son loves the truck, but it isn't as interesting with out the little car and the plastic parts of the truck don't look like they will take much before they break, so it could very well be broken before I ever find the cars that go with it."
1,Someone help me here!,"O.k. Can someone explain to me why a 4- to 8-year-old needs a toy called a Bachelor Pad that expresses the ""racy"" side of this movie character? I don't care how much fun your kid has playing with it, it's not appropriate. When are we parents going to open our eyes and pay attention to what the manufacturers are selling our children?"
4,"fun for your Cars fan, but ONLY if you already have the cars","As a maniac mom, I bought the complete set of little cars more than 2 months before the movie opened, and thank goodness I did because they are impossible to find now unless you are willing to pay a ridiculous premium. I think that for the price, it is a bit of a rip-off that it doesn't come with a Lightning McQueen, especially since that is the whole appeal of the truck. You also have to read the box carefully to know that there is no McQueen included. I like that the truck comes apart and reattaches to the cab easily, so that my 4-year-old doesn't have to ask me 20 times a day to do it. I do think that some of the features are dramatically overstated (come on, a ""game station"" ?!?), but the kid really digs it."
1,Disappointed in the price,I bookmarked this item to purchase in December. My son's birthday is a week after Christmas. I am DISMAYED to come back to this page and see that a simple little plastic (a little junky!?) toy has changed in price from under $15 to almost $100!!!. The Note that Amazon gave me was that this toy was no longer available from the original offering company. I wouldn't consider paying that much for a toy that won't last. Read the comments below and see for yourself if the toy will last. I'm very disappointed.
2,Too many small parts,"My son loves the CARS movie and seems to be on a mission to aquire every toy made. He was very excited to see the Mack truck finally available to go with the cars. Unfortunately, the trailer, which is supposed to open, requires a knife to pry open. Once it is open it is filled with tons of very small, extremely breakable parts that fold in and out and actually prevent you from getting it closed again. Most of them didn't last the first day in our house. Once he'd broken all the little pieces and basically stripped the interior it was alright. But we still need a knife whenever he wants to re-open the trailer.I love the idea of a Mack truck to go with the toy cars. I just don't understand why they had to make it so ridiculously elaborate."
2,Not a toy to be played with alone!!,"While this truck is certainly entertaining for my 4 year old, the trailer is impossible to open or close for him. He loves to play with it while it is open - but needs help opening and closing it. Unfortunately it also has LOTS of cheap little plastic parts that are constantly coming off the inside of the truck - often times while opening the truck!! (shower curtain, wash brushes, etc.) Luckily, my son is extremely gentle with his toys - and isn't too upset about things coming off----so long as I can get them back on. A little wheel has now popped off the inside of the truck and I think it's going to take glue to fix it - it actually looks like it was attached with glue. We've had the truck for 6 weeks, not sure how long it will last. This truck is cheaply made - and I wouldn't recommend it - personally, I'm glad someone else bought it for him!"
1,Read the fine print,"I am very disappointed, I ordered this toy on Black Friday for my son, for Christmas this year. It took over a week to get it in the mail. I was most disappointed by the item description. The picture shows a lighting McQueen car, comes with this toy, it does not!!It is also not as big as it looks in the picture. This toy is definitely not worth the 32.99 plus shipping that I payed. I was extremely disappointed with the toy overall, it was supposed to be the big toy my son was getting for Christmas. I would not buy if I were you."
3,My son loved it but...,I got this for my 4 year old and he loved it but it is not a very well made. It does not stand up well to a 4 year old.
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun","Bought this as a present for my nephew who is 2 and loves the movie ""Cars,"" he constantly plays with it and all of the cars he has. He enjoys imagining Lightening McQueen in the movie with his friend Mac. I would recommend the toy."
2,"A lot of money, a lot of cheap plastic",The product was very expensive compared to the amount of molded plastic it is made from. I'm guessing Mattel's profit on this product is about 70% of the purchase price. It should have been made of metal. I am wondering how long it will last under the hands of my son.
3,not as great as I thought it would be.,My son is 4 and he loves this toy. I think it's pretty neat but it is very hard to open for my 4 year old and even for me sometimes. Pieces do break off easily. It still seems to be a favorite of the cars toys so far though. I do wish we had spent the money on the Mack car carrier though.
3,Not as big as thought,I thought this toy was bigger its actually small but my son loves it the original price is way to high I did get it cheaper througha combo deal
3,Daughter loves it - but now exactly what we expected,"This is a fun toy, but the description of it didn't help me understand exactly what it was. The back of the truck opens up and unfolds to reveal a little car wash, a tire changing area and I think a massage table maybe and tv (not sure what it's supposed to be exactly). Matchbox sized cars fit well in it."
3,Disney Car,"Well my son really loves this toy and plays with it constantly, I just wish it was made a little nicer the sticker on the back is peeling off and he only got this for Christmas."
3,mack truck review,"My 3 year old son loves it, but it is a little difficult to open for him. It's not as sturdy as I would like it to have been. But for the price, it's a nice toy."
3,A nice addition to the series,"Marston evokes an appealing sense of place and time, but his characters and their dialogue, especially their diaglogue, are too stiff.Did the Elizabethans never use contractions? Were they always playing verbal games (compliment me/stab me in the back) with each other?A little more realism and less rigidness would be appreciated - even if it means that the characters appear less than heroic or predictable.I prefer that our historical brethren live and think and feel, within the context of their times of course, as we do now, even if means putting up with all the imperfections and sillinesses that quantify us, then and now.Unfortunately, it is difficult to relate to Marston's characters. And this feeling of too much distance is the only imperfection of his novels: his people are too rigid to reach across the hundreds of years that separate us, however much we want to touch them - or they, us."
2,Light stuff,"My husband has been experimenting with the different Bay Rums (even tried to make his own). The Gabels is SO light and the scent doesn't last long.It doesn't have a bad scent, it just doesn't last."
1,High priced Low quality,This was no where close to the Bay Rum my husband is used to. Product just did not meet his expectations.
2,Not enough Bay Rum oils,"Has less alcohol than many aftershaves, so less sting. Also has very little essential oils. Fragrance gone after a few minutes. Nice aftershave for the skin; not useful as a cologne."
1,gone in 60 seconds,"If you are expecting a lasting scent like ""Clubman"" or ""Royall Spyce"" pass this one up. It is so lightly scented it is ""gone in 60 seconds."""
1,Not impressed,"Cannot really review the product as it arrived all beat up, torn and leaking inside three different mailing packages. Someone had tried a home patch job with scotch tape on one of the bottles. I refused service and wrote to the company requesting a credit on my credit card. As of today I have not heard from them as to the credit. Will keep an eye on my next statement."
4,Excellent for the price!,"This is a wonderful everyday use aftershave. While I have ""finer"" bay rums that I reserve for special occasions, this one is superb for frequent everyday use, particularly in the summer months. The scent is authentic and the price is right!"
1,NOT the bayrum scent of yesterdays barbershop,"I was GREATLY disappointed in this product. I am searching for a clean refreshing feeling with the scent of telic powder. I do not recommend this product IF you are looking for that clean scent and feel you experienced after the barber finished your haircut and neckline trim. I would have considered returning this but it is after all a personal product so in the trash it went. The feeling is oily and the scent is like a sage and very strong, like the spice that is stuck on a ham before baking it.Jim JonesRochester NY"
2,After shave,"This product is alcohol based and does not soothe the skin. It may as well be a bottle of perfume, it did not do anything good for my skin after shaving."
1,"Cheap stuff, why bother?","This stuff is mostly alcohol, very little bay rum scent. I just wish the bottle wasn't so large so I wouldn't feel as bad about tossing the bottle in the trash.I think that every bay rum aftershave I have tried is better than this swill. I am unimpressed."
2,Lousy rechargeable battery.,"I bought this and found that the rechargeable battery in the screwdriver doesn't hold a charge very long. It makes the whole tool box much less useful. Perhaps the battery was bad from the factory. I didn't find this out soon enough to return it, and I haven't yet figured out where/how to replace the NiCad battery. I'm disappointed."
2,Gets 2 stars only because of reasonably useful tools with screwdriver,"Thought this was a nice deal as a kit at local True Value store. Nope, as with the prior reviewer this doesn't hold a charge long and thus renders the rest of the reasonably nice selection of tools rather over-priced (local price even on sale was $10 more than Amazon).Do yourself a favor, if you want a cordless screwdriver, get one of the smaller, well rated cordless drills with two speed ranges like the 12V Hitachis."
5,Outstanding romance,"This was a lovely romance with a protective and good guy hero and a sweet heroine, and where the hero actually treats the heroine decently and gently. Unusual for books written in this time. Evy Hart was low on courage, still suffering the effects of a very abusive marriage. She now lives in Puerto rico, where she meets the dashing Jason. Jason turns into her night in shining armor, protecting her when some of her late husband's business associates come a calling. Jason never wavered in his devotion to evy, even though Evy was not ready to embark in a relationship. I thought many times Jason's patience must be neverending, and he never failed to be gentle and sweet with Evy, with everything she's been through. I would highly recommend this book, it was outstanding romantic reading.Cyndi"
4,Jersey Boys CD,"Love the music, saw the broadway show-which was wonderful. I now have better understanding of the lyrics of the song and how it was created due to real life situations. Wish the swearing was not on the CD but it is the actual script. Other than than, great music. Even my daughter loved the broadway show, so I bought her a CD for her and for myself."
4,Jersey Boys CD,"We saw the show in Philadelphia in Oct. and purchased the CD on Amazon. The CD is very good but only 4 stars since I thought the singing in the Philly show at the Forrest theater was better than the original cast recording or should I say closer to the original ""4 Seasons"". The lead in Philly was Joseph Leo Bwarie (started in the Vegas show) who was definitely better than John Lloyd Young on the original cast CD as Frankie Valli. The show in Philly was absolutely incredible as I thought it would be a poor cover band rendition of the original 4 Seasons but I was blown away with how great this show is along with the rest of the audience. The CD is a great keepsake and played often."
4,Love the music,"Love the play and I love the music. The CD was a cheaper on Amazon than it was at the play, and it is the same CD. CD arrived in great shape in just a few days."
4,Can You Believe All Those Hits?,"Fun listening, over and over again, by a group that's shaped American 20th century music. Includes part of the story as well as the music."
5,"Love, love, love this!","After seeing the show, I had to have this. Play it all the time when I'm working in my craft room. Great sound for a great price. Arrived on time in excellent condition."
3,Not pure 4 Seasons,"I saw the bockbusting ""Jersey Boys"" in Cleveland, and thought it was great! This recording is straight from the New York stage production and has some dialogue introducing the music that may be confusing to someone that has not seen the stage production. This version is good in that the modern remixing of the songs is a definate upgrade to the 60's & 70's recording. It does lack full versions of the selections and includes some non-4 Seasons music (Short Shorts and My Boyfriend is Back.)"
5,Best Show I've Ever Seen on Broadway,An experience not to be missed! It was worth the trip from California! What an incredible show!WARNING...this CD is addictive and could be hazardous to your health. Listeners will be tempted to sing along and try to reach John Lloyd Young's falsetto until one's voice is raspy and raw!Enjoy!
5,Great Juke Box Musical,"Saw the national company in San Francisco and had no expectations whatsoever, but loved it!!! Always liked the music anyway. This should be the prototype for any further juke box musicals. Most should be relegated to theme parks, but Jersey Boys is a perfect example of a well crafted, intelligent musical using popular music. What a great time!"
5,A great Musical,We really enjoyed seeing the Jersey Boys musical in San Francisco. It is surprising how many of the songs you have heard before and know. So we natually purchased the CD. Very well done. You will enjoy it.
3,Too much talking,"Didn't realize there would be so much dialogue from the play on the CD, including the ""f"" word twice. Just expected music, which is excellent."
5,Great service!,The product arrived quickly and in the exact condition as stated by seller. Great service!
3,Great CD if you don't mind hearing the f--- word,"I purchased this CD to listen to Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons music and was not expecting the f--- word to be used during talking between songs. An otherwise excellent CD, both music and vocals. I should have know better after seeing the Jersey Boys on Broadway; great show, great music interspersed with lots of completely unnecessary foul and offensive language."
1,If you haven't seen the show I can't see how you would like this one,"I love 4 Seasons music. This is not a good representation of their music. Most of us in fly-over country must be missing a lot by not seeing the show. It is a huge leap from this mess to the great performances of a great group.Obviously, most of us would be better off staying away from this one. Also, this CD should come with a ""Parental Advisory"" sticker. The use of filthy dialog to enhance 4 Seasons music doesn't work. This cd will be included in my next garage sale."
2,not as good as expected,my husband loved cd but was born in newark and hung out in belleville so that was a part of it --- lead in play has much higher falsetto than frankie valle and it hurt my ears to hear him sing.....LUCKILY for us we saw show with understudy whose pitch is just below frankie's and MUSIC TO MY EARS - i recommend the cd - best of four seasons - real frankie and great tunes........don't get caught up in moment like i did! and NEVER be afraid of understudies!!!!!!!!!
1,Profanity Ruined This CD For Me,"The Four Seasons are far and away my favorite music group from the 1960's. I have their albums, CD's and videos. My elementary music class loves singing their songs and I wanted to give copies of this CD to my students. They are to the '60s what ABBA is to the '70s. That said, I was disappointed with The Jersey Boys which I hoped would be equal to the Mamma Mia CD. My main complaint is two uses of the ""F"" word on The Jersey Boys. If you don't mind this on your CD I suppose you will like it, but I think others should be made aware of its inclusion. However, this sure ruined the CD as far as I'm concerned. I'll stick to listening to the CD of the authentic Four Seasons."
5,"jersey boys - the story of ""the four seasons""","this is a broadway soundtrack at a good price!! my father, being old, is a fan of old music, like the four seasons, so i'm hoping that he will love this stocking stuffer i bought him."
5,Wonderful,"I bought the CD about one month before we went to see the show. My husband didn't understand why I would do that but after the first time he heard it, he was raving about it. The show on Broadway is fantastic and I listen to the soundtrack quite often. Anybody who grew up with this music will enjoy it. Can't wait to see the show again."
4,For once a jukebox musical spins off an enjoyable cast album,"The 2005/06 Tony award winning musical is made up of hits made famous by Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons. What elevates this show above the usual ""juke box"" show is the tight, dramatic book that is a fairly truthful re-telling of the group's rise to fame. The CD preserves the Tony winning performances of John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli and Christian Hoff as Tommy De Vito. As laid out for the CD, the listener to follow along the story using narration and few dialogue scenes. A good thing too as the booklet contains only the sketchiest synopsis and presents mostly press-agent puffery. At least in this case JERSEY BOYS lives up to the hype."
4,It's what I expected,"I was pleased with the content of the cast recording. There's plenty of music and enough dialog to tell the story. If you like the Four Seasons or even like musical theater, you can't go wrong with this."
5,jersey boys cd,I listen to this on my 35 to 45 minute ride to and from work and it always takes me back to the night of the play and the era which puts me in an upbeat mood!
5,Jersey Boys (2005 Original Broadway Cast Recording),Great CD; we listen to it all the time! We were shocked at the first song - thinking the wrong CD was sent - until we realized they were pointing out how their music was heard around the world.
3,GOOD CD,"This a a good CD. Talented singers and the great songs. But these certainly are not the originals, but they do not really pretend to be."
1,Jersey Boys'! Forgetaboutit!,"I was really disappointed in this product when I gave it to my Mom for Mothers Day. There are very few full-length songs on it and the recordings are of poor quality... No matter what kind of price this disc is advertised for it is not worth the money as far as I am concerned. If I had listened before buying, it would have been no sale."
4,Will I hear Frankie Valli or not ?,"OK, this is a great sounding cd, production values are top-notch and we all know B. Gaudio's hand was in it. We all know who Bob Gaudio is, right? Ok. Being that this is a given; that it sounds luscious once you crank up the power, then it all comes down to: Will I hear Frankie Valli or not...Well, John Lloyd Young isn't him, but you just have to hear what he does with these classics.I am impressed.I mean, Bob, Mr. Gaudio; you have this new guy that sounds so much like the young Frankie Valli...Why not give him brand new material with that famous Season's Four style and sound...Music tastes run cyclically, I'm sure a high pitch lead singer would blast through today's Billboard charts like you guys did way back when!I'm getting carried away...and everyone will too. Just give this cd a listen."
5,tuutsea,"After seeing Jersey Boys on the stage, I purchased the CD. It helps remind me of how much I enjoyed the stage production. The music is great!"
5,Jersey Boys C.D.,"This was a great Show I saw it yesterday and as soon as possible I Bought It. It has songs such as Who loves you, Sherry, Walk like a Man, And Much more."
3,Jersey Boys,"I saw the play twice and the album is just ok, since it's without the energy and humor of the play! I absoluteley LOVED the play and was disappointed in the cd."
2,DISAPPOINTED,I am so sorry they had to curse so much. I am not offended by appropriate foul language but this was uncalled for. Ruined the music for me and others. Too bad they bowed to the lower class.
2,Returned,Didn't realize there would be so much dialogue on the CD. I only wanted the music so will return the CD and get the original music of Frankie Valli instead.
1,Just not very good,We had seen the Jersey Boys on TV and could not wait to get their CD as we love the oldies. They sang them all so well on the TV show too. The CD has some good tracks on it but way too much talking and just is not a very good CD. If they make one with just them singing the oldies we would be first in line to buy it. This CD is a huge disappointment and just not what we hoped for.....
2,Scratchy,"The CD I received in the mail had fine scratches brushed across the surface making the CD ""skip"" in many of the songs and some CD players would not even recognize and play the CD at all. I had to upload the music from this CD onto my computer and download it onto a new blank CD to get it to play properly. The music itself is wonderful. The physical disc it came on was damaged."
2,Disappointed,Would have been better to have gotten a Four Seasons album instead. Language foul and album hard to follow.
5,Incredible!,This CD is incredible (just like the Broadway production)...It is very enjoyable even if you have not seen the show; but it is even more so after attending the show.
4,A little surprised.,"I purchased the CD BEFORE I went to the musical, so I was not prepared for what I heard. I was expecting music only, so was a little disappointed. AFTER I saw the musical I totally understood the CD, it goes right along with the play and is really good. I enjoy listening to the wonderful music and hearing the story again."
5,Jersey Boys soundtrack,A very good CD. Plays just like the broadway show. I think my four year old loves it even more than I do.
5,The Jersey Boys Rule,"I enjoyed the play so much, and now I have my own copy of the wonderful, nostalgic music. I'm delighted."
5,Love it,Love it. Loved the musical. Love the album. What more can I say? It is stupid to require 18 words.
5,Fun!,What a great CD! I pop this in at work & it immediately perks me up. Just bought tickets to see it at the Ahmanson Theater in LA. Can't wait!
5,Awsome. I just had to see it live.,Awsome. I just had to see it live. And I did. Frankie Valli appears here in October. I'll be there.
4,Jersey Boys,"Having just seen the musical, I couldn't wait to get a copy of the CD. While the music is great, the CD is actually all the talking in the musical as well, which comes across as odd and there are pauses.If you want to hear the entire show, then get this. If you just want the music, seek another alternative."
5,Jersey Boys Takes You Back To The Theater,"Finally got the CD after seeing the touring company show for the third time (it's that good!) in Seattle and glad I did. It's a lush studio production by the original cast, complete with brassy horns, twangy guitars and thumping drums, plus a few snippets of dialog to tie things together. It's not a rehash of the entire show, just some highlights but, if you've already seen it, the songs will take you back like you were in the theater all over again. The perfect CD for cruisin' down the Jersey Turnpike, or the I-5."
4,jersey Boys,Had friends see the show in NY. This CD just brought back good thoughts and wonderful memories.
4,Great 60's Music,"I dont know how this plays on the stage, but it sounds great on CD. The 4 Seasons were one of the great 60's groups and I remember them well. The only thing better than listening to this show is listening to the real thing. A must have for old fans and people who are too young to remember what they were like. Great songs. If you remember the 60's like I do, it will bring back fond memories. Great stuff. 4 1/2 stars."
3,Disappointed,"After hearing some of the music from ""Jersey Boys"" while watching the Tony Awards, I was looking forward to the CD. What a disappointment! I thought I would be hearing great covers of the the Four Seasons. Instead, the CD consisted primarily of too much talk and shortened versions of the songs. I'm buying the CD to listen to the music, not listen to someone pitching dialog from the musical. I thought I was hearing a Vegas act! Finally, it would have been nice to hear the full version of Ces Soirees-La.The Four Seasons are one of my favorite groups from the 60's. Fans are better served buying Rhino Records 2-Volume, Frankie Valli & The 4 Seasons - Greatest Hits, that has 30 of their top hits and singles by Frankie Valli."
3,I Prefer the Voices of the London Cast,I saw the musical in London and I have to say that I prefer the voices of the London casts over the original Broadway cast.
3,Jersey Boys (2005 Original Broadway Cast),Singers doesn't try to make the same sound the same original. The music sounds like the voices don't care about what they are doing. I was kinda disappointed.
3,Jersey Boys,The album is GREAT. I loved it so much I went to N.Y. to see the show. It was the greatest show I have ever seen. The whole production was GREAT.
4,Gift for Mom,"My mom loved it and she played it in the car and I must admit this stuff is damn catchy. I think it's essential for people who saw the show, but still works for people who haven't."
4,Great and fun music,"Luv this cd- just what I expected!!! It brings me back to memory lane. After watching the broadway show, I told myself had to get this CD and it didn't disappoint!"
5,my review,Fast efficient service. Brand new unwrapped. Very happy with this product and I would recommed the service to anyone looking for a great deal on cd's.
4,Impressed,"This was very well produced. The cast members sound very much like Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons; probably as close to the real thing as your going to get. The selection of songs is great. I like the fact that there is less dialogue mixed into the tracks than a typical Broadway cast recording. If you're a fan of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, or the show Jersey Boys, you should really enjoy it.Jennifer K. LaffertyAuthor of Offbeat Love Stories and More"
5,Jersey boys CD,The Cd is great . I felt like I was back at the theatre listening to the music in person. It arrived promptly and in good shape. Thanks
4,A very good CD,This CD is true to the musical we saw and Jersey Boys is one of our all time favorite shows.I would have given it a 5 but there is a tad too much talking which took a little away fromthe music but I would buy it again.
3,So So,I was disappointed by all of the talking on the CD. Just wanted to listen to their music. My fault for ordering the wrong one.
5,Jersey Boys,My wife and I went to see Jersey Boys show recently. Had been humming the tunes since so ordered the CD to keep the feeling going. Excellent!! Brings back good memories of the period. 4 Seasons musical was perfectly captured.
2,Not so Good,"I just saw the Jersey Boys in NYC,this cast is the best singing and acting group that I have ever seen and heard.If you go,go see and hear the Matinee performance with Dominic Scaglione,Jr as Frankie Valli.Not to place any dispersions on the other Frankie's but his voice is just so strong and reminds you of a young Frankie,truly incredible.They should remake the soundtrack with this newer cast and him and you will see and hear the difference,also brilliant casting."
5,Walk Like A Man!,"Saw Jersey Boys on 12-18-12 and needed the soundtrack to relive the moment.The Amazon Down Load is FABULOUS!!matter of fact I used it today at Planet Fitness while I did my 45 minutes of cardioyes there is a little bit of talking & voice overs & 1 or 2 slow tracks, BUT for $11 DEAL!treat yourself"
4,Cartesius,"It's a quite useful item for my professional pratice: it allows me to show my students Descartes's philosophica path in a way other than just reading the philosopher words... It' as if Descartes himself were talking to the kids, showing them his doubts, and how he solved them."
2,what is it with funimation?,This is the lowest I rated DBZ but what is it with funimation? they should have a 17 minuite thing (gohan makes a friend) about gohan finding a robot world! DAMN FUNIMATION. I'll learn to buy captain ginyu ones from here because they are uncut any way this DVD was bad there are better ones than this but buy this one but you'll be disapointed..........
4,Good DBZ video,"its good for dragonball fans to understand the story but it has been edited, from the original japanese version. END"
5,"unforgettable, superb","This was one of the most memorable books I have ever read. Unfortunately, it's out of print. If anyone knows where I can get a copy, please let me know."
4,This was a gift,This was a gift for my mother in law for her birthday. She had been trying to find this book in local book stores and had no success. I was happy to have found it for her. It made a great gift. She has greatly enjoyed reading this book.
5,Please reprint book,"I have read this book several times in the past. I was able to check it out at the library, they no longer have it to read, and I have searched all over trying to find it. I really want it for by own library to read again, and let other family members read it.The story of the 2 brothers was mind boggling on the amount of trash they accumlated in their house. I am amazed this was never made into a movie.Fran"
5,An unforgettable and unusual novel,"One thing I always hark back to about this book is the unclear line between eccentricity and obsession. Whenever someone in my family starts acting a bit too idiosyncratic and odd, we jokingly (tenderly, nervously) remind each other of My Brother's Keeper. Publishers, please reissue this classic!"
2,Background music,This is not the original artists recording. Just some cheesy orchestra playing the tunes. You have been warned.
5,Awesome! Cherie Bennett really captures the heart,"I have read Bennett's books for years. And at frist thought this book would be much to young for me. However I bought the book and the I found left me spellbound. With amazing charactes and a great story line, this book is a must read!"
5,"Z L (Shoreline, WA)",I thought this book was very good. It talked about a girl who ends up getting a form of cancer called leukemia. She meets people in the hospital who like her and don't like her. During her difficulties in the hospital some zebras come to her and she thinks their not real but what she comes to find out is that she is the zebras assigned human. She goes back and forth to her assigned zebra herd. This is a great story for people who like to act like their in the book.
5,Zink-a tale of hope,"If you had cancer who would your friends be, people or Zebra's""I choose the Zerba's"" or at least Bekky thought.Zink is the tale of a girl that is told she has leukima, so her world is devistated by it. For her relife, she talks to her friends the Zebras. The Zebras are alll knowing creatures and they can talk. But who the Zebras worship the most is a zebra named ZINK. Zink was different form the herd because he did not have stripes he had spots. Bekkey looks to Zink as her idol because he had a fight aganist socxiety and he won, Bekky has a battle with leukima. Th most merombal moment in the book for me is when Bekkey calls her so-called-friend Debra, and they start a conversation and she tels her the syptoms of relaps and she has them all so when she sees her dad she says "" You lied"" and he said""your lying to your self."" A great book of hope."
2,Too much scoop to the spoon,"I bought this to be a mixing-type spoon. I find the bowl too deep for it to mix well. It's almost as deep as a ladle. I prefer the style you used to get from Betty Crocker- a flatter bowl to the spoon, but since you can't get that any longer, I'm looking for suitable mixing spoons from other places. I use this, but it's not the first one I reach for."
3,"Good read, needed editor","I've had this book for years and recently reread it. Made me wonder whether Michael and Suzan Carson are still the raving lunatics they were during their killing spree back in the 1980s.Unlike the other reviewer, I never identified with the Carsons. They, and their twisted thought processes, were terrifying. I'd like to know what they had to say to Richard Reynolds after they read the book and discovered what he really thought of them.Cry for War is a good read, a page-turner. But countless typos and misspellings, including many in proper names, distract the reader and give the book a slipshod feel."
3,"Others have tackled this subject better, but worth reading","Maybe.Other reviewers have given the gist of the plot, but I don't agree with their ratings, that's why I review this book. LeGuin in Four Ways of Forgiveness has written better about slavery and how it destroys the owned and owners.Octavia Butler in The Kindred writes better about the sexual relationship in slavery between owned and owner. In that book there are outsiders who make it easier for us to empathize.Many of Samuel R. Delaney's books are about unequal sexual relationships. I prefer his too.I liked Hallie in this book, but Frenna was too distant, too strange, ultimately an unsatisfying hero, for me. Troah was too too scary to also be sympathetic, as I think she was supposed to be, eventually.In my opinion, it is worth reading, if you don't expect too much from it. And you've read the others first."
3,Interesting but it isnt clancy,"I got this book for chistmas along with Tom Clancey's shadow warriors. I figured i would read this book quickly before i went back to school because i knew that Clancey would defiently take me a while longer.After recently finishing the book, I can say that it was a very interesting read. Other reviews have bashed this book saying that ""An officer would never really disrupt a supperior officer's orders."" It should probably be repeated that this novel is FICTION.Being in Army ROTC in college, i found this novel more interesting than probably most. The Author obviously had alot of officer input when writing this, especially when describing the jury. In closing, it isn't clancey, but still worth your time."
5,Nice,"An interesting piece of work. Not sure how a reporter could have managed this take on the military -- unless he ""slept with the enemy"" -- but it's nice that someone finally did.Also interesting is the switch from nonfiction to fiction. Hmmm. I've never written a thing, but I imagine the style change must be hard.Keep up the good work, Thomas."
4,a soldiers duty,"very fast moving military thriller.writer is right up there with griffin ,who is ny all time favorite."
2,Starts off well but fades at end,"A Soldier's Duty reminded me of those movies that start off great but then fade in the last 20 minutes. Ricks obviously has good insight into today's military and the distinguising cultures of each service branch. He interleaves these observations throughout the book and that is the strength of this novel. For military buffs, this is a very easy and entertaining read. The big negative though is the thinness of the plot and the absurd decisions that the main characters make. An intelligent reader will have to suspend his logic when reading this book. As all of the protagonists are extremely intelligent they do some very dumb things. Also it becomes way too easy to determine what is going to happen - just like a poorly made movie. Ricks has the ability to write a really great novel, but this isn't it."
2,Uneven plot and poorly-developed characters,"I'm not exactly sure what to say about this book. Several things come to mind:1) Without any spoilers, the ending was awful. It's as if the author thought, ""it's time to end now."", scribbled some twaddle, and called his publisher.2) The characters were banal. There's the too-trusting, team-playing male and the quietly-suffering, outsider female. Wow, no way we could've seen that coming.3) The section on the court martial was poorly done and should've been deleted.Maybe the author'll get lucky and they'll cast Ben and JLo for the movie.As an irrelevant aside, I grin at the author's obvious worry that he perceives military officers as outside the mainstream (actually, it'd be more accurate to say they're outside his chardonnay-sipping, gallery-opening attending, Bryn Mawr and Wellesley-supporting mainstream). Since I'd bet dollars to donuts he'd prefer his kids were rabid PETA members than commissioned officers, all I can say is DUH."
4,Love it!,"I haven't had my steamer very long, but I can't wait to try many of the features available. So far, I have cooked fresh vegetables, and they are very good. I'm anxious to try rice and hard boiled eggs. The steamer is easy to use and the directions are very helpful."
4,Recommended,"I'm using this steamer for a couple of months for now and it is really good device. I especially like its simplicity, nothing to study in manual.One con is that trays can be used only in specific order. Earlier I had a similar steamer with identical trays and this was slightly more useful design."
2,Good at first...but lacking in long-term quality.,"Bought the 5711 steamer 2 years ago and it broke today, the element won't heat up anymore. We use ours fairly often, but never ran it dry. I tried to find a replacement element online, but it Oster recommends taking it to an authorized service center (2 hours away), no thanks."
4,Great Steamer,"I rec'd this as a gift this past Christmas. I have never owned one before. Today, I used it for the first time steaming brussel sprouts. It was very easy to use and the sprouts came out tasty. Cleanup was very easy. The only problem I have is that there is no shut-off button, or if you try to turn the dial back to reset to a lower time, you can't do it.I plan to steam chicken next......yum, yum!"
5,After one year still love this steamer...,"After going through a few different brands/models over the past 6-7 years, we just decided to go ""low tech."" We didn't need or want digital timers and any other bells & whistles. We eat a LOT of vegetables and rice, and we just wanted something that's simple, works well, and RELIABLE. 1+ year after purchase this unit is still working great. If we get at least another year then we will feel like we've gotten our money's worth.***UPDATE***It's now 8/5/2011...the Dow may have just had a 500-point meltdown yesterday, but this steamer is still rockin' those vegetables and rice. Great steamer."
2,Good while it lasted,"This is an excellent idea - clean and efficient plastic, easy to use, easy cleanup, and easy to prepare for steaming. But after about 15 times of use it stopped working. The computer activated on/off switch and the ""hold and heat"" no longer work. It's now completely useless, and even though it probably has a warranty, I don't think it's worth the trouble."
1,Timer failed and burn internal wire,"I owned this steamer for a while now and we use it to steam frozen breakfast in the morning. It worked when it was new.Then, after a while, the timer just keep on jamming when it supposed to turn off. One day, the internal wire just burned after the timer supposed to turn off but it failed to do so.I fixed this steamer by cutting the burned internal wire and it last for 1 more month before it rest it peace forever.I won't buy any steamer with analog timer any more."
4,You will definitely eat your vegetables with this steamer!,"After reading about how boiling or even microwaving veggies sucks out a lot of the nutrients, I started looking around at steamers. I found this had great reviews and at the price, I put it on our ""wish list"" for Christmas and my mother-in-law got it for us. We've used it multiple times for broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, white idaho potatoes (cubed, skins left on) and hard eggs. Everything has come out well. My husband esp loves the broccoli; it just melts in your mouth. No need for butter or salt; this is restaurant quality! I was skeptical about the eggs but they came out well too. I am looking forward to using it for fish too, as I want to increase the amount of fish we eat. If you're looking to try a steamer to increase the ease, quality and quantity of healthy foods you and your family eat, try this; you won't be disappointed!"
1,dissappointing,"Oster 5711 Mechanical Food SteamerI have a small Black and Decker steamer works great. I saw the oster and liked the size and wanted an oblong, so got it. Tried it out and was very dissapointed in the time it took. I put a few slices of cabbage in bottom tier suppose to be 18 min. and some brocoli and cauliflower in top suppose to be 14 min. The cabbage was about half done in 35 min. so removed it and lowered the brocoli pot and it went another 10 min which totaled 45 min. and was about 3/4 done..so much for my opinion of double decker. If you put timer at high number you cannot turn it backwards to lessen the time. I wonder why they make this large size then tell you to put small amounts in it, seems like a waste to me. The steam output is about half of my Black and Decker. I am wondering if I purchased a steamer or a lemon."
5,Great Steamer,I bought this steamer to replace a different brand steamer that I returned due to poor design.This one has worked like a charm.I like the roomy 2 tiers that fit together well and the built-in egg holders. I also found I prefer the manual turn dial to the electronic ones that are available on other types of steamers -- I have not had any issues with it malfunctioning.The steaming begins almost immediately and the unit does not need to be taken apart to add water.
1,The product may be defective,"My old Oster food steamer broke down after more than 15 ytears of good service. I thought I would get the same satisfaction from this new one, but it has so far been very disappointing. The water never reaches boiling temperature, so that even after half an hour or more, the food being steamed is still lukewarm and I have to transfer the food to my microwave oven to have it properly reheated. This is a big contrast to the old steamer, which made food steaming hot after about 20 minutes. I am of the opinion that the unit shipped to me may be defective and wish to return it for a replacement, but unfortuantely I have discarded the original packing and the return slip because previous Amazon shipments had always been satisfactory. How do I return it for a replacement or a refund?October 2, 2012: Product returned and replacement received. Replacement worked perfectly. thank you!"
4,steamer from Amazon,"vegetable tried took about 4 times longer than stated in the directions. Should have been 15 min, but took more than an hour. Like the item itself, it's clean, quiet and I'm determined to figure it out."
3,Oster Steamer,I have used it a couple times only. I am so far impressed how you can see the level of water in it. I love how you can add water without taking it apart. I have not tried to stack and steam yet but am looking forward to seeing how that works and also looking forward to how the rice cooker is
2,Uneven results and long cook times,"I was in search of an egg cooker after I melted the lid on my old one. On seeing this, I thought it'd be a good choice, letting me hard boil eggs and steam lots of other foods too! It didn't work out.The instructions says to cook for 15-18 minutes for hard boiled eggs. I did so, and my eggs were still RAW. After about 35 minutes of total cooking, some eggs had perfect yolks but undercooked whites. Others had perfect whites but overcooked yolks. In other words, this thing took a ridiculously long time to give uneven results. I tried a second time and had the same poor results. I'm returning it now."
2,Mechanial Timer Mechanism Breaks,"After only a few weeks of use, the mechanical timer broke. It would time to about 10 min left, then stop counting. Then it stopped counting altogether. Made in China?"
5,love this steamer!,"I had this exact steamer for quite a few years and used it probably 4 times a week. I steam a lot of veggies. My first one finally gave out so I purchased a duplicate online. It came to me promptly, as it was stated in the description, and it works like a charm! I have used it as a rice cooker, a double steamer, and (usually) just as a single steamer. Never had problems with it. I am looking forward to many more years of use from this steamer."
1,NOT Full of Hot Air!,Don't waste your time or money---I did both! This so called steamer is worthless. I tried using it for all the food items listed in the directions booklet and none of them cooked properly. Use your kettle and steamer insert for steamed foods. This Oster product won't perform as you might expect it to.
5,Love it,It cooks everything fast.It is big and easy to clean.The price is really affordable.Would recommend anyone who wants to cook fast and healthy food.
2,Oster 5711 mechanical food steamer white,"This steamer works well. The reason I am writing review, the steaming trays turn white, and the bottom and sides are falling apart. i have two of these. The bottom of steaming trays are almost completely broken on one steamer. Use once a day. Purchased in August of 20011. Called Oster, no warranty. They were not to friendly on phone.So now they are useless. model # 5711. Waste of my money. Will look for stainless steal electric steamer."
5,Great,I don't know what has happened to Mark Morrison. This is another solid album. I wish he was making more music - if he's still around
2,Why aren't the publishers listed by subject of interst?,"I need the information in a different format - by subject matter of publisher's interst. When I tried to ask about it, my message wasn't even read."
5,It's 5 stars worth of information!,What can I say about a book like this that hasn't already been said? It's a tremendous piece of work and a great help. It's 5 stars worth of information!
1,"Sure, the information in this book is current if","Sure, the information in this book is current if your potential agent is doing a life term in Sing Sing. But of the five queries I sent out based on the information in this book, two were just unanswered and three came back addressee unknown. Maybe I picked the only five bad addresses in the book, or maybe current it isn't."
1,There's only one reason to buy this book,"The contempt the author has for writers and the contempt so many of the agents have for writers is the real theme of this book. If you want names and addresses, use the internet. If you want a book that can actually help you get published, read The Square Guide to Publishing Your Non-fiction Book by Rudy Shur."
4,More Detail than Writer's Market,"...people do get published using market guides like this one. I am a published author of seven books (my last book is in its third printing now) and I have used this book and writer's market to get my queries in front of the right editors for my topic. Writer's Market has more listings, Jeff Herman's has more detail. If you can't afford a $...subscription to Literary Marketplace on line, this and Writer's Market are the books you need. I personally use both because each has its own strengths and weaknesses."
1,If you are a serious writer...skip this reference book,"This book really sucked! Save your money! The I have tried to contact Mr. Herman about some of the problems I have encountered with the contact addresses he provided. He has yet to respond, meanwhile, I have wasted valuable postage for addresses that are incorrect or not in existance. One other note, many of the persons contacted were not accepting new talent, and hadn't been for quite sometime."
2,There's an easier (and cheaper) way,"The addresses and phone numbers in this book are handy, but this is not the way to find an agent or publisher. Instead, visit the largest bookstore in your area and take a look at the books they sell that are in your genre. Look in the ""Acknowledgments"" section of each book and you are almost certain to find the names of the author's agent and the book's editor. Those are the agents and editors who are most likely to know about your subject and its chances of being published. Find those people using an online white pages or yellow pages site (anywho.com, dogpile.com, etc.) and give them a call. If they are receptive to your idea, send them a formal proposal.I have to agree with those who have suggested that publication of a book like this by someone in the business smacks of exploitation. As one other reviewer noted, the author is an agent - call him up and see how receptive he is to you. You might as well try looking for Elvis in the supermarket."
5,Great value for bulk cooking!,"Great value and taste. I use this for BBQ pork, which I make in bulk and freeze. I am so glad to have found this!"
4,Mmm...Hickory Smoke...,"Great smoke flavor addition to most meats I cook.Now I have a ten year supply, and need three more words."
2,The product is not what was advertised AND it came damaged!,The description said this was a dual-zone unit. It is not. And the refrigerator was damaged. The top hinge on the door was bent. You can pay less for a better wine cooler. I don't recommend buying from this company or this unit.
2,Poor Quality at High Price,"After unpacking the wine cooler, I noticed the door caught on the frame bracket that holds the leveling foot - nothing I tried fixed this so the door has to be forcibly closed. One of the wooden shelves was broken and the bottom two-tier shelf is so flimsy, it fell apart when I tried to take the retaining packing tape off it. There was a clear repair done to the top of the door frame, this had been spot painted very poorly by spray paint. Given the high price, this item is VERY POOR VALUE - I'm still considering returning it - but what else is out there that could be better?You are probably better off with 3 of these:AKDY Electronic 32 BTL Wine Cooler Cellar Chiller Adjustable Control AZ31EC"
3,Danby 75 bottle- Good for the average wine.,"75 Bottle Wine Cooler (Black with Platinum Door Trim) (58 13/15""H x 23 5/8""W x 25 11/16""D)I bought the Danby Cooler through another retailer in Houston, and got a great deal. It looks nice, has good storage, but is definitely a bargain cooler.1st) The temperature varies by about + or - 5 degrees, for a total fluctuation of 10 degrees! I think this is a non-issue for the average wine, but I think it would likely not be best for real collectors.2) Noisy compressor.3) Shelves not easy to slide, etc. Wooden shelves look nice, though.4) Overall, a great bargain buy."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"For 5 months this has been an adequate, if not somewhat loud wine fridge. This week it has been very loud and today I noticed that, although the temp is set at 56, my wine had frozen and several bottles (of very nice wine) had exploded. The damage/cost of the lost wine is hard to estimate or think about.I contacted Danby earlier this week about the noise, but they haven't felt it necessary to respond to my service request. BEWARE."
4,Ajeemah and his son,This book is very different and it's not something I would normally read. But it was nice to get out and read different things I don't always think about. It gives the imagination fuel to burn. And the book was very cultured. I would recommend this book to people that like books with different cultures.
1,My rating,"I did not like this book, it was boring. There was no action.I only like Science Fiction books, or non Fiction."
4,1st time watcher,"I found this first season in the $5 bin at Walmart and said ""it's got to be at least worth $5"". I had never heard of the show before, but being a purveyor of old TV shows I loved it. This is definitely well worth the price that is on Amazon. Anyone that grew up watching the Disney version of the Adventures of Robin Hood should like this more realistic version of the stories. I'm off to buy the second season from Amazon."
5,Fun Going Back to 50's Black & White TV!,"As I watch ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" again, it really takes me back to a pleasant and simple time of my life. I was probably about 9 or 10 when I watched Robin Hood...must have been in reruns. The first episode I watched, I immediately remembered how each episode opened with Robin Hood shooting his arrow and the accompanying music. Fond memories! The episodes are really quite good...better than the trash on TV today. Richard Greene is great playing Robin. I'm really enjoying watching the series again. It's definitely worth the money paid!!"
3,Picture Quality - Poor,"While it is fun to see the old series again, I was disappointed by the poor picture quality and would suggest the manufacturer either spend a little more to restore the quality or not offer the product for sale anymore."
2,"Obviously no ""digital remastering"" in this one.","I've watched quite a lot of 1950s TV on DVDs in recent years, but when it comes to picture and sound quality, this is by far the worst I've seen. There are spots and specks, and in some scenes you can actually ""hear the projector running."" Other than that, the shows are fairly watchable, though low-budget productions typical of 1950s TV."
1,Way to Big,This glove was rediculous the size of the glove fit my hand and i'm 29yrs old. Mylec does a horiable job giving info on the size of its items. Very dissapointed and will think twice about ordering from Mylec again.
4,Very Good,"Steve Morse, Like fellow rock artist Eric Johnson is a highly talented artist. But for some unlucky reason did not get the fame and recognition he deserves."
4,a mega-man among boys. .,". . very rarely can i say that an artist from yesteryear has power to attract beyond his former rep. . . but clearly pete does. . impressed by his songs, the maryville project and the promotion of it all. . thanks pet, thanks platinum entertainment . . keep it coming. ."
5,Re-energized Townshend puts out great live disc,"I couldn't wait to pick up this disc after seeing the Letterman show and Pete's lick on ""Heart to Hang Onto"" and it does not disappoint. The opening tune cover of Canned Heats' ""On the Road Again"" sets the tone for an amazing live show. Pete's performances on ""Drowned"" and ""I'm One"" are as crisp as his work with The Who at the '96 shows at Madison Square Garden during the Quadrophenia Tour and his rework of ""Anyway Anyhow Anywhere"" is a pleasant surprise for any Who fan. And you won't believe how Pete and Jon Carin turned the classic ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" into a masterpiece! This disc blows the ""Deep End"" shows out of the water!"
5,PETE- PLEASE GIVE US MORE,"I BORROWED THIS CD FROM THE LOCAL LIBRARY AND POPPED IT INTO THE CD PLAYER ON THE WAY HOME AND WAS TOTALLY ASTOUNDED FROM THE OPENING OF THE OLD ""CANNED HEAT"" SONG ""ON THE ROAD AGAIN"" TO THE END OF ""HEART TO HANG ONTO"" AN OLD FAVORITE FROM ""ROUGH MIX"". PETE HAS ASSEMBLED A SUPERIOR GROUP OF MUSICIANS FOR THIS ""LIVE"" RECORDING AND THESE GUYS NEVER LET UP THOUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CD. IF YOU ARE A WHO OR A PETE FAN, YOU ARE DOING YOURSELF AN INJUSTICE FOR NOT GETTING THIS RECORDING. FROM EARLY WHO THROUGH QUADROPHENIA AND PETES SOLO ALBUMS THERE IS ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU PLAYING THIS ALBUM OVER AND OVER AGAIN. ONLY ONE OTHER THING - PETE - PLEASE GIVE US MORE."
5,Take it for what it is!,"Let's talk about old Pete here? I feel that this album has got a lot to offer when you look past it not being The Who. You may say, ""He speaks most of the words."" Well hell, the man's almost sixty years old. We'll see how well you sing when your sixty. And so what if think he should throw in the towel, Christ it was for charity. And honestly, even if it wasn't, if you knew you could receive the kind of money he can get from doing a couple of shows you wouldn't do it? I thought so. So let one of this century's greatest songwriter's be proud of and sing HIS songs."
2,They Call Me The Strummer,"Speaking as a huge Townshend/Who fan, I think I'm qualified to say that this album is dissapointing at best.Townshend sounds good, and the show was probably great if you were in the building, but listening to Pete strum some old favorites gets a little dull.He is the best, when he's with a band. And you know which band I mean.By the way, I didn't find the ""bonus disc"" to be much of a bonus: there's less than 11 minutes of music on it.Try ""Deep End Live"" instead--it's a great live Townshend CD."
2,No Atmosphere Or Development Of Any Kind,"This book was enjoyable but trashy. A string of erotic and/or action passages strung together only by the plot of the first book. The only interesting characters were peripheral or killed, so I don't know how keen I'll be on reading the last book in this series."
2,Really too fast to read.,"The second book of the diaries of the family Dracul is not good as the first. It's definitely too easy and fast to read, even for an entertaining book. All the good things in the book come as consequences of ""Covenant with the vampire"", in primis the great pseudo-historical connection between Stoker's vampire and the 1400's voievod. There is too much meaningless and very little sensuality...sometimes we forget that they aren't exactly the same thing; but this is a problem of many writers today. I see this book more as an intermission between the first and the last book than a volume with its own completion. All that is told in ""Children of the vampire"" had to be put in the first and in the third book, I believe. Luckily, the other two tomes are better. Read this one just to connect the facts and the characters in the other books."
4,Very good!,"This is the second book out of three dealing with the diary's of the family Dracul. I found this book to be interesting and hard to put down. I admit that I liked the first book a little better (5 stars) but I still like this one much better than Anne Rice's vampire chronicles. I am a big fan of vampire books and I recomend you read all three books, Covenant with the Vampire, Children of the Vampire, and Lord of the Vampires."
3,"ONE OF THE BEST, BUT A COUPLE OF FLAWS","Jeanne continues the trilogy with the this second book CHILDREN OF THE VAMPIRE. The book has every aspect of horror and suspence, every vampire lovers quality, but it lacks in structure of the story. Even though it entertaining, you could sometimes get confused. Another thing it doesn't take to long to read, and some of the events will make you ask questions, that will be answer in LORD OF THE VAMPIRES. Well, over all the book is great, the sex and horror makes up for the flaws, and anybody who loves vampires should get it!"
3,A bit of a disappointment...,"After reading Covenent of the Vampire, I was quite disappointed in this one. The book seemed to be a filler in the trilogy, the characters were flat and the story didn't go anywhere. It seemed that it was just a chance for the author to put gore and sex together on paper."
4,Dracula Legend with Embellishments,"The second volume of this trilogy introduces a few more original notions than were evident in volume #1. The historical basis is somewhat improved, noting that Vlad served as a page in the court of Emperor Sigismund and was a hostage in the Turkish sultan's seraglio, and the plot and characters are well conceived. The appropriately few erotic scenes are deliciously rendered, although the throbbing undercurrent of sensuality inherent in the subject is not as palpable as in the tales of Anne Rice. An excellent choice for Halloween reading."
3,"A good start - not the best possible, but nevertheless a good start","Former enemies Islaen Connor (Commando Captain) and Varl Tarl Sogan (ex-War Prince, now a fugitive on the run) join forces in order to stop a plot of destroying a human colony placed on a hostile planet.The strong points were all about the Connor-Sogan relation, and the story could've been a whole lot better with a bit more deep insight into the characters' motivations.The weak points were about the scenery: a lot of pretty unconvincing out-doors places (this is an alien, newly-colonized planet that feels like a copy-cat of Earth's tropical/sub-Saharian nature).In all,an interesting book. Not the best in the series, but an acceptabele starting point. Recommended."
5,Wonderful addition to the GF bookshelf,"I'm a mom of an 8-year-old boy with wheat allergies, and I'm always on the lookout for recipes to try. I'm a big fan of Bette Hagman and so grateful to her for her legacy of wonderful books. This cookbook is great. It has so many categories of desserts that you can make just about anything you want (Cookies, Puddings, Frostings, Cakes, Cakes from mixes, Pies, Cheesecakes, etc.) and the recipes I've tried are very delicious.My son loved the sugar cookie recipe we tried yesterday and when his sisters tried one they said they tasted even better than the wheat equivalents. The dough was so lovely, soft, and velvety. I was so surprised, having had many experiences with gluten-free dough, not all of them good.Bottom line: if you're a celiac or allergic to wheat, this is a great cookbook to have in your kitchen. Check it out at your library first, try some recipes...you won't be sorry."
3,A good start to a solid series,"An enjoyable book to read, although I do disagree that Robb is the second coming of Ellis Peters. Her plots are complicated just to be complicated and some of her ""good"" characters are unlovably sticky. Her insistence on the occasional arcane vocabulary seems arbitrary and pettifogging -- especially since perfectly good modern English words are available for most of them. (After all, her dialogue is actually a ""translation"" of the Chaucerian language they spoke in, anyway.) Nevertheless, Robb is a good writer and constructor and the book is a romp to read. Better start the soap opera here, by the way -- she won't catch you up later in the series if you miss an episode."
1,not a mystery at all,"I have enjoyed Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael series very much, and when I first discovered this book, I thought I had found another wonderful mystery series.I am sorry to say that this was a major disappointment.The plot, the mystery is weak-actually there's no mystery at all-the villain is too conspicuous from the start.I did not think much of character development either.Does the author have to remind the reader of the protagonist's attraction to the opposite sex that many times?And Magda Digby, the character that seems most real to the author-does she have to talk like Yoda?Lucie Wilton-the female protagonist-is so good and beautiful that it gets irritating after a while.Archdeacon Anselm is too much of a cliche-Really, no redeeming features at all ."
5,Quorum 151306-8 Damp Outdoor Ceiling Fan,"Very happy with this fan. For a 30"" blade, it really puts out a lot of airflow. This fan is outside on a porch so having a fan especially made for damp areas was important. I'm also very pleased with Delmar Designs. We had a problem with the initial shipment as the incorrect fan was sent and we did not notice it until it had already been installed. Their customer service was great and promptly ordered the correct fan and had it shipped prior to our returning the incorrect fan. No restock fee either. Very happy with their service."
5,Best vegetarian cookbook ever,"This is the best vegetarian cookbook I've ever used. Every dish I have made from this volume has been delicious, easy, and quick. While some of the recipes take a little planning ahead (ie, calling for cooked rice) the majority really do whip up in no time, and the combinations are creative, tasty and generally quite healthy. I find that with most cookbooks, I make a few recipes, and then lose interest because they are hit or miss. I've worked my way through at least half of the recipes in this book and always turn back to it. I would most highly recommend this cookbook for anyone who is low on time, but still wants interesting, delicious meals!"
5,Great product,I love this duvet. I'm very happy they have a cover that is made of flannel. Great feel. Would purchase again.
1,Cheap for a reason,"I bought these around Christmas time because I thought they were attractive and the price was awesome. After first rinse, they started to fall apart. There were strings coming off the edges. I washed this and the pillow cases two weeks later and balls of fuzz were everywhere from this material. They are uncomfortable and cheap. I regret this purchase."
3,Dissapointed after first wash,"The fist time I washed this duvet, it did not shrink and remained together and I have to say its very soft. It also did retained it colors. The only problem I had with this flannel Duvet like most flannel is that it now have fuzz balls all over the cover. I have since purchased a fabric shaver to remove these balls and now looks fine."
2,"Over engineered, poor quality control, good customer service",Required two calls to the support line to get enough good parts for one working fixture. Giving two stars because of the excellent customer service. Very friendly and helpful. I guess they get a lot of practice with products like this.
4,Little seen series is odd gem,"In short, if you like Supermarionation you should enjoy this short-lived Gerry Anderson entry. However, if you prefer the big-headed Thunderbirds style puppets to the realistically-proportioned Captain Scarlet type then you may wish to steer clear. Stanley Unwin makes this show, plain and simple. His low-key acting style and classic gibberish dialogs are the main attractions here. The interesting use of much more live footage, inter-cut with the marionettes is both a daring departure and oddly distracting. Overall I found it quite charming. (And for just $6 for the set who can complain?!?)"
5,Special Music for enjoying His Presence,"I knew that I'd like this CD because I like all the others Terry has done. This is especially anointed because it is instrumental and the only conversation is between me and God.Terry has a wonderful gift of being able to enter God's Throne Room and we are allowed to accompany him. Sometimes, this music just opens the door so I can move more freely past the ""suff"" that's going on around me. It dispells ""things"" that bother me and opens my mind and spirit to be with my Creator. What a wonderful time to relax and worship at the same time. Thank you, Terry, for putting this together for us."
2,Previews of track beginnings rather misleading,From the previews given I thought these were some very pleasant calming slow instrumentals. Unfortunately the second half of almost every track adds a back beat and pushes the tempo up. Certainly this is a more popular style but quite the opposite of what I was looking for.
5,Actually it was very funny and goofy,I liked Safety Geeks. It is an independent looking thing but frankly it's unique and being a fan of Adult Swim and Monty Python humor I thought I'd give it a try.Pleasant surprise it's good and it something to actually watch on my 3D TVGood laughs and cast
4,Really good love story,Cynthia Williams isn't sure she wants to marry her fiance David Daniels because David can be sort of controlling and is pressuring her to be a stay at home mom. David also discourages Cynthia from finding her birth parents because the search will distract her from their wedding plans. Can Cynthia plan her future when she knows little about her past?David got on my nerve through out most of the book but you could tell he really loved Cynthia and his controlling ways were they way he showed it.
3,Good study tool,"Shakespeare is often unintelligible to the average person. The idea of getting a script with the original and a modern version side by side was very attractive, and has proved most useful in understanding what I am reading. However, I was disappointed at the lack of poetry and rythym in the modern version given in this book. I definitely would never perform the modern English script as given here. Still, this version is very useful as a study tool, and I recommend it for that purpose."
3,Pretty earrings. Very dainty.,"Pretty enamel earrings, bought as a gift.For $22, they should have come with the little stoppers on the hooks so they don't fall out of your ears. Most earrings have those now. Also, 3-5 day shipping was delivered in 8 days, but other than that, the earrings are very pretty."
5,Useful reference book,"I bought this book while working on some informaitno retrieval related project, and it turned out as a useful reference for explaining terminology, suggesting efficient data structures, and offering good references for further reading.However, the book turned out yet more useful to me as, during my M.A. studies (in CS) I had to write a work on ""Suffix Trees"" and ""Suffix Arrays"" and I found that Gonnet, Baeza-Yates and Snider describe equivalent ideas they call ""PAT trees"" and ""PAT arrays"".I found this book useful too for working on computational linguistics related projects as well.In short - I like keeping this book always in reach, as a reference, though, I found this book not so friendly as an introduction book to the subject (""Managing Gigabytes"", might turn out to be a more welcomming)."
4,"Like Sam & Dave, you'll love Eddie & Ernie","Quite simply, they were the other all-time greatest Soul male duo. This excellent retrospective contains 24 gut-wrenching soul classics...a number of them were previously unissued. Unfortunately, the tracks originally issued on Eastern (4 tracks) are hopelessly distorted.All-in all, the track ""Falling Tears (Indian Drums) recorded for Columbia is worth the price of the CD. Just amazing.Also, finally, 'Self Service"" from 1964 (originally issued on the tiny Madley label and picked up by 20th Century-Fox Records) as ""The New Bloods"" is perhaps the only known soul ballad ode to masterbation! (""I don't have noone to love me....so I'll have to serve myself..."")"
3,I WAS DISSAPPOINTED,"Having heard Eddie and Ernie on the Deep Soul Tresures Series, I was looking forward to hearing this compilation of all their other hard to find stuff on this CD. I was dissappointed. They sound good, but their choice of a lot of their material was not that great. It's enjoyable but not essential stuff."
5,Griffes,I heard the title piece on the radio several months ago and was intrigued. I am glad to have more music of this underrated American composer.
3,This covers him...,"NAXOS with artful readings by JoAnn Falletta and the Buffalo Phil., and some superb engineering, give's us an affordable value CD of Charles Griffe's limited French-Impressionist influenced orchestral output(he died at 35). All the works included on this disc with the exception of ""Poem for flute and orch."" are linked to some poetic or literary ideas. His masterpiece ""The Pleasure Dome of Kubla Khan"" is his most memorable composition. About 12min. of frenzied paganistic lust featuring low bass and interjections of howling brass. With the exception of the ""Bacchanale""(more tempered than Pleasure Dome)all the other works are less memorable and less colorful than their titles imply, only showing Griffes's Ravel-Debussy style. My 3 star rating does not berate the performers or production, only the minimal influence of this composer."
2,"Great Music, Horrible Disc Quality","This is the simple review: the music is killer. Neil Turbin is great.Music is 5 stars. Disc quality and editing is - 2 stars.Here are the problems: The disc sounds bad. Also, there is an unforgiveable 2 second gap between each song. The gaps exists even when the song is supposed to blend into the following tune. It was so annoying that I put my CD on Ebay."
1,"Great Albums, Horrible Release","Fistful of Metal is one of the all time great metal albums. Unfortunately, this release sounds like it was sourced from 96 kbps mp3s. Buyer beware. Buy the original releases instead. You'll be more satisfied with them."
1,So disappointed,"The music is great but the sound quality is really, really bad. Even worst than a 96 kps mp3. The best solution deals with the purchase of the two separate albums."
5,Best Game ever,"I agree this is one of the best games ever created. If only they would create games like this again for those who love suspense. All you need is your mouse and you play for hours. I keep hoping one day I'll find they've re-released it and I'll be able to play it on my MAC. It's like a good book that scares you and you can't put it down, even though night is ticking away and you need sleep. One night I was playing after everyone went to bed and ""something"" jumped out and ""got"" me in the game. I had to turn it off and wait for day light. They don't make 'em like this anymore."
5,Uh huh huh... Cool.,"This game is really good. It got to me in perfect condition. In fact, it's so good that I'm gonna make a story that depicts what I think would happen if this game's storyline happened with Beaviss and Butthead being the character."
1,too small for the current screen,"Unfortunately, I cannot play this game. Have taken my system and the game to Geek Squad, they cannot get the screen to enlarge so that we may see the entire screen. No the resolution will not help, we've tried everything. ALl you get is a partial screen in the middle of a full screen, cannot play the game, bought it for nothing!!!"
4,Arturo,"This seems to be a fine watch, everything I was looking for.However I am still having difficulty getting the alarms to sound after the times have been set. Yesterday I did get an alarm to sound, I`m not sure how but I only heard it because I put my hand up to scratch my head. In other words the alarm part of the watch is useless, impossible to set and difficult to hear."
2,Battery Vampire,"This watch, while competent, drained the battery in only two years. I've gone to a solar watch."
3,Casio Men's DB37H-1AV Watch,"Good looking watch, but display is kind of dim, so it is hard to see the numbers displayed under many light conditions. Pressing the ""light"" button helps somewhat, but pressing it more than once a day shortens the battery life in half or more."
4,Nice Watch!,"Clean sleek look, easy to read for someone on the go. I like the black/silver look and easy hook too."
4,Good prouct!,"I like all casio watches, the product was received on time and it was as described online."
4,"A Very Good, Soul Searching Book","I'm no fan of George Stephanopoulos, but I was intrigued when I heard about his book, All Too Human. Being the same age as myself and having had taken similar paths (although with different philosophies) in politics, I wanted to find out his view of the Clinton Administration. I was impressed by how clearly he wrote of the moral struggle he faced and how overwhelming the temptation to compromise often was.I intend to write a favorable review of the book in my newsletter, Worldview News, that will be a surprise to the thousands of Christian consevatives who will read it."
2,Not Nietzsche,"George clearly flaterred himself by borrowing the title of his opus from Nietzsche. The book is written in dense prose, peppered with showbiz terminology and makes clear that ""meritocracy,"" a false god we worship, is just an illusion.The book is neither witty nor informative. It certainly does not do to politics ""what Liar's Poker did to Wall Street."" I feel sorry I succumbed to hype and bought it.C+"
1,"Poor, pathetic George.","George gets a rash when over stressed, has to take anti depressants and see a therapist. I wouldn't want this guy managing a ToysR Us store. These lame kiss and tell books tell us very little we don't know already, I don't hear how well the country is doing or any number of good or brave decisions made. George thought he would write a book about the REAL Clintons. I guess he just wallowed in his own self righteous navel gazing."
2,Not Enough Information,"I would have liked this book better if it had given more information on how to actually produce information-hiding packages in Oracle. The treatment of how to use Oracle PL/SQL to create stored procedures was also shallow and superficial.I feel that Oracle Unleashed was a much better book. Hopefully next time Mr. Stephanopolous will enlist an experienced database administrator to flesh out the book's weak points. Academic credentials have very little to do with real world database administration, and this book proves it."
5,"In-depth, honest and well-written","A stimulating and surprisingly in-depth, lucid, and non-tabloid-style portrait of the enigmatic world of Bill Clinton and the White House - and how his spinners were kept up nights handling scandal after scandal. You won't find much about Monica here, so don't buy it for this reason.A memorable and hardwon insight into Clinton is that he is simply ""an optimist and a doer."" That said, the novel seems to show Clinton's influence on the narrator, from that of an intellectual cynic to, I believe, an optimist himself. Another note is in the midst of a petty battle, Bill Clinton says simply, ""I did it because it was the right thing to do.""You can also see Gore in action, battles with Hillary, and his contribution to the passing of affirmative action.Thank You George for taking the time, care and effort to humanize the often ""demonized"" chambers of the White House. Scandals aside, my respect for those in office is even greater as a result."
4,Great effort...good result.,"Stephanopoulos' book chronicles his time with the Clinton Administration, from being recruited to being shunned. Here is a man who fell victim to the Clinton charm (as did millions of Americans), and then developed a bitter taste in his mouth as Bill, Hil, and all the rest began to systematically exclude and discredit him.Unfortunately, Stephanopoulos does not do a very good job of transitioning from star-struck lackey to jaded ex-politico. Certainly, there must have been a gradual transition from worshipping Clinton to criticizing him, but ""All Too Human"" handles that abruptly.The fact that I have to dig so deeply to criticize this work demonstrates that it is a very valuable read. Generally honest, certainly an insider, Stephanopoulos truly does provide, as the subtitle claims, ""a political education.""I recommend this book."
3,Not Bad,"This book is not bad for what it is: a history of his time at the Clinton administration. Those looking for great insight into Clinton or his presidency will probably be dissappointed. But Stephanopoulos does give a good account of how the White House deals with scandals: deny, deny, deny, fight, fight, fight. This us-them mentality seems most prepetuated by Hillary Clinton, even when (as in the Whitewater dealings), they should just have come clean. All in all, the author is always honest, if not yet wise."
1,All Too Boring,"After all the hoopla, this book was really disappointing. The author's style is bland and flat and the only fact he managed to tell us that we didn't already know was that he had ""sort of"" dated Jennifer Grey. Wow. Who cares? I, for one, wish the publishers would have given us five or six good, but lesser-hyped books, rather than paying megabucks for what's already been printed in the newspapers."
4,Interesting Exploration into politics,"Great book for those looking to learn more about the thoughts behind politics. This book made me admire George Stephanopoulos, and gave me a better understanding of the race for the presidency. Anyone interested at all in President Clinton should not miss out reading this book."
2,All Too Ego,"What simplistic tripe this book is. Stephanopolous injects far too much insecurity in this writing. He, on numerous occasions in the book, alludes to the fact that his being ""Greek"" has some kind of correlation with the other ""oppressed"" peoples of the world - absurd. Additionally, he seems to be the driving force behind ALL of the successes during his involvement in the Clinton Administration, relegating people like James Carville to a back seat (the opposite seems to be true if you read any of Carvilles works). His bias is clear and not at all masked, which supports the current "" I am not a narrow-minded liberal even though I behave like one"" mentality prevalent in today's network news media. Pass on this book and get one with true insight and analysis."
4,Very Honest and Interesting,"Stephanopoulos holds little back in his account of the Clinton White House during Slick Willy's first term. He writes about the campaign, the trouble that Clinton could get himself into, and the trouble a President haves with a split White House staff. This is a great look at the behind the scenes work of a chief political advisor to a corrupt president. He writes of the relationship between Dick Morris, Clinton, and himself and the constant conflict that arose between what seemed to be two completely different white house staffs. Ultiamtely though this book is about how his feelings of pride and hope were lost in a President with all the potential in the world because he couldn't control his private life."
4,A page turner...even for a die-hard Clinton supporter,"To put it short, anyone who is interested in getting more of an inside view of the Clinton administration needs to read this book. I am still supportive of President Clinton but realize that he had many tricks up his sleeve. Stephanopoulos paints a very realistic picture of the inner workings of the Clinton White House. Excellent book!"
1,"trite, superficial and self-serving--I, i, I, I--Ay-Ay!","George Stephanopoulos is without a doubt the Kato Kaelin of politics, and his shallowness shows in devastating clarity in this whining tome of self-pity. He, rather than Clinton, comes off as the one who craves appreciation and bites back when he doesn't get it. Save your money."
3,Worth a look,"Stephanopoulos' style is appealing & makes for a quick read. He leaves out some details that might make the story more colorful (especially about his own life), yet includes others that seem irrelevant. While reading the book, I always felt he was holding something back from me as the reader, and it bothered me throughout the book. I wonder if he had waited until the end of the Clinton presidency, would this book have been more in-depth? For someone who had once considered the priesthood in the Greek Orthodox Church a profession, his Machiavellian world of Clinton politics is certainly a far cry."
4,"Politics, President and Spin Drs...good reading","I've read books on the Reagans, George Bush and other presidents. None carried the attention to political spins we see every night on TV or read in the newspapers. I thought GS did a pretty good job outlining his commitment to a liberal philosophy (even greater than Clinton's) and the need of the office of president to manage the news. I found the book enjoyable, frustrating, and hurtful but would recommend it to anyone who enjoys stories of and about presidents and the stories behind the stories."
4,An excellent insight from a former pro-Clinton supporter.,If you are in any way interested in American politics and are currently studying Political Science you must read this book. The insights of working as a staffer are incredable you feel as if you are walking besides George S. in the halls of the White House exchanging war stories.
2,"Light reading, Easy on the Analysis","If you are interested in intellectual and political analysis concerning the Clinton preseidency, skip this book and read Dick Morris' Behind the Oval Office. Yes, Stephanopoulus is a smart guy with strong background in political theory and tactics. Nevertheless, his sense of strategy and the big picture are lacking.This is a light book and if you are looking for easy summer reading this may be just for you. There's lots of tidbits from behind the scenes."
2,Not much new here,"For all the flack Stephanopolous got for writing this book, I really expected some juicy insight (gossip?) as to what makes this White House tick. All I found was a little more detail on what was already apparent - the Clintons are self-centered opportunists and surround themselves with the same.Glad I got this book at the library, instead of paying for it."
2,Its my party and I'll cry if I want to,"I bought this book for two primary reasons: 1) I have always been intrigued by G. Stephanopolous' public comments, and 2) I was very curious about the details regarding the inner workings of the Clinton Whitehouse. Mind you, although I wanted details, I wanted a fair and balanced account.If this describes your interests as well, then don't place this book at the top of your list. Some very interesting glimpses are offered into a presidency defined by poor leadership and a lust for higher poll numbers. What overshadows all of this, however, is Stephanopolous' self-serving approach to documenting history. Everything is filtered through his ""they hurt my feelings and didn't appreciate me enough"" perspective of the world. After a chapter or two of this, you can't help but doubt the honesty and objectivity of anything the author has written.My recommendation? Wait for the paperback edition."
3,"Marginal book, some good insights","George Stephanopoulos (and any other young, ambitious, politcally active person) should have read David Stockman's ""The Triumph of Politics"" BEFORE he went to work for Clinton, plunging into the political scene. Perhaps he would have understood the true nature of national politics, with or without his morally flawed boss. Stockman, the OMB Director for Reagan from 1980-1986, detailed the pitfalls of Washington politics far more coherently than Stephanopoulos or any of the other ""kiss and tell"" types who have left Washington with an axe to grind and a book contract. If you really want an insider's view of why we have a bankrupt Social Security system, a multitrillion dollar national debt, rampant corruption, etc. read Stockman's ""The Triumph of Politics"". Don't say you weren't warned."
2,nothing much really new,"Stephanopoulos reveals very little of importance. His main themes are that Clinton lies constantly, Hillary is deep into coverup of Whitewater and denial of the President's adolescent sexual persona and the total absence of integrity at the top is mirrored by staff and cabinet who value their positions above the truth. Donate the money you would spend on this to some good cause."
3,Compelling and revealing,"Stephanopolous brings the reader into the cabinet of the first Clinton Administration. We are privy to the daily crisis and decisions that dominate the daily life of an advisor. We see the subtle descent of even the most consciencious politician into the business of living for the pols. Stephanopolous is honest enough to admit that the lure of Washington did indeed take hold of him and drive him to distraction on several occasions, and they are chronicled in the book. There is no hero in this book, rather it is the ongoing story of how many individuals deal with the mind crushing pressure of United States Politics, and the results on their personal and professional lives.The book is adequately written in a brisk and clean style that makes for easy consumption."
3,Interesting in two ways,"This book is interesting in two ways. The first is the rise of a working class immigrant's son to the position of political advisor of the world's most powerful statesman. The father of Stephanopoulos was an working class immigrant yet his son was able to become a Rhodes scholar and reach the position in politics he did. The American success story. It is also interesting, from a much more cynical perspective, in that Stephanopolous' political advice was all politically motivated and absolutely none (with emphasis on absolutely) had a basis in the actual non-political benefits or costs (or efficacy). Extremely cynical. One comes away wondering whether it is even possible for the political process to produce socially beneficial policies instead of just politically expediant solutions."
5,"Love him while you're reading it, hate him for writing it.","Quite simply a fascinating read. From page one you are engrossed in both the gossipy details and the human frailty. But unfortunately it is a guilty pleasure. Because while you come to respect Stephanopoulos for his candor, his intelligence, his fine writing, and his attempts to keep his moral compass, you can't quite bring yourself to forgive him for kissing and telling. You desperately want to absolve him. You feel it is only fair since you are enjoying his tattling so much. But in the end, you can't get past it. It casts a dark cloud over a delicious read."
2,kind of boring,"I wanted to like this book, but found it somewhat boring. About half way through I had to start ""speed reading"" by only reading the first and last sentences of each paragraph whilst skimming the rest."
4,I thought the book was interesting.,"I read this book because I was impressed by the author's personna of integrity. As a person totally uninterested in politics the book was beguiling enough to almost compel me to start voting. Although, as I would hope hope every voter knows those we are voting for are only human. I thought the book was about humanity and the impossible scrutiny that our leaders our subjected to. Personally, I believe that in order to be in politics personal integrity must be sacrificed thus the sins that come to light could possibly be much less serious than those that never do. All told though I (a non-political person) did enjoy reading this book. It is probably the first and last book I will ever read concerning politics, only because I don't in general like politics."
4,An honest book from a former spin-meister,"I was pleasantly surprised to see how forthcoming Stephanopoulos was with his assessments of both White House policy and his own shortcomings. For years we have heard him tirelessly defend his boss, no matter what the circumstances were. Now we hear about his doubts, his qualms, his insecurities about an administration he helped shape.I also believe the book has added credibility because this clearly was not a man with an ""ax to grind"". There are many instances in which praises the strengths of the President. Nevertheless, he also points out the lapses in judgment and policy shifts that were commonplace in Clinton's first term.To gain perspective on the current White House by a man who was so integral to its successes and failures is a real treat. Anyone who has even the slightest interest in politics should make this a must-read."
2,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME,"Who cares if he dated Jennifer Grey? All I kept hearing through the entire book was ""pity me I'm so stressed"" and ""Clinton's my way too the top"". George gets what he wants and then he turns on Clinton...at least until the polls change. Stephanopoulos is nothing but an arrogant opportunist and this book offers no new insights."
3,Good book if you want to understand the right-wing conspirac,Want to know about Clinton? Read it! You will find all that you want to know about how the right-wing conspired against him!Clearly the best book writen about the soul of Clinton. Even his most ardent supporter couldn't stay with him!
4,See George...,"See George dream. See George in awe of Bill. See Bill bark and bite at George. See the rest of the people with clout on the hill torment George. See George trying to fight back. See George trying to maintain idealism. See George succumb and surrender to the pressures of the dirty nincompoops and write a book about his experience.That's what it's all about.Pretty good, if ya ask me. (grin)"
5,It's a page-turner!,This book was a suprise--I couldn't put it down. Stephanopolous's perspective is unique and his honesty is refreshing.
1,Nothing of value here,"I checked this book from library (glad I didn't buy it), hoping to get some information on Clinton era, good or bad. George tells nothing new of Clinton's administration. Nothing of value politically wise.Not much of his life except that his family was proud of him. It seems he was only obsessed with hatred for Dick Morris. I can't even say much about the book because there wasn't much of a book to review."
4,Very Informative,I was reluctant to buy this book at first because I was afraid It might change the way I feel about President Clinton whom I've always admired. I was curious and bought it anyway. After finishing the book my mind is unchanged. Mr. Stephanaopolous helped me see things from a different perspective. I now understand the difficult road politicians start down when they aspire to become our President and the equally difficult job of their campaign teams especially. I realized after reading this book that politics is not a clean game and no one is without flaws. I also understand more clearly Mr. Stephanopoulos' role within the White House and the enormous stress involved during his position as the President's senior advisor. He takes us beneath the surface and shows us the human side of all those involved. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in gaining insight into one of America's most complex jobs.
4,Good stuff.,"To me this book is basically the story of a guy's tough times at work. It has lots of nice anecdotes. Very readable. Not especially idealogical, not too nasty either. It is easy to relate to George's high stress gig. There is a picture of him with a beard, which he grew to cover up anxiety related skin problems. That is the level of honesty we are dealing with here..."
3,St. George plays devil's advocate,"George was a willing cog in the machine that helped elect this deeply troubled man who currently runs our country. After reading this mediocre 'tell all' I felt both pity for the President and for the author. Both of these men were given enormous gifts to work with and have squandered them. They are both adept at lying, covering up, betrayl, self grandizing etc. And then in the great American tradition, capitalizing on all of the fore-mentioned. Perhaps, after all the dust has settled and all the opportunistic books have been devoured some true insight will come of all this. Thanks St. George."
3,British readers are refreshed by the honesty and condour,"Living in London and surrounded by the villainous stench of British government, it is so refreshing to see the openness of the US system - warts and all. People may criticise Stephanopoulos for being a turn-coat but as a citizen you have to appreciate that in the US, government institutions and government figures have no choice but to be open. Ultimately, the people decide. And, in a democracy, isn't that how things should be? British democracy exists in name alone. We should be - and I am, at least - jealous."
4,Behind-the-scenes look at the Clinton presidency,"Heard the taped version of ALL TOO HUMAN: A POLITICALEDUCATION by George Stephanopoulos, one of PresidentClinton's senior advisers . . . this is a real behind-the-sceneslook at what life was like in the White House . . . I felt thatI got to know not only Clinton better, but also Al Gore, DickMorris and Hilary Clinton--and in doing so, was not veryimpressed with any of them . . . somehow there werereal accomplishments . . . yet I was amazed that thishappened given the resultant scheming, protracted decisionsand last-minute flip-flops . . . the author's question at theend puts this all into just the right perspective: ""What if thisgood President had been a better man?"""
2,This is a self-serving bunch of subtle lies and half truths.,"True to my perception of this little weasel as seen on TV, this book is a totally self-serving, ill-disguised pro-Clinton tome. Every Clinton (Bill and Hillary) crime is an ""inadvertant"" error by mid-level staffers. The impeachment was an out-of-control prosecutor who caused it all. He is so pro Hillary that she should send him a bouquet as she tries to pull the wool over NY's eyes.The greatest outrage is that Georgie-boy becomes an ABC ""analyst."" I fear for America."
1,Spin Cycle from the inside,"The most satisfying part of this book was finishing it. It was a waste of time and merely a weak attempt to defend the Clinton adminsitration. Stephanopoulos conveniently forgets any problems or dishonesty in the administration. The whole book can be explained as Liberals are saints and conservatives are devils. Give me a break. He is a fraud. If you want to read the life of the saints, go to the religious section of Amazon."
1,Little to be learned,"Yet another how-I-lost-my-innocence book from someone who spent years spinning lies, only to be *shocked* to discover there was gambling in the club!Stephanoplous, who spent his career spinning lies and rumors for Clinton, expects us to believe that he suddenly discovered that something was rotten in Denmark. The truth seems to be more that he was being eased out of the center of power in the later Clinton years as the kids were fired and more professional career politicians were brought in to handle the damage control for a reckless president."
1,"No new information, too whiney","I found this book to be a great disappointment. I expected some inside information, something new. I believe anyone with access to the NY Times could have written this book. George sounds like he thinks he was a ""player"" but but he comes off as a little boy playing with the big boys. Hillary certainly escaped his notice except a for a couple stories."
5,"Although I am a Little Old for Lambchop, I still love it!","Awesome! I have always loved Lambchop (and it's SOO sad that Sheri Lewis died-:(), and this, as a Hanukkah special, is really wonderful. Charlie-Horse uses his software gift to enter a make-your-own-superhero contest, and it is ente rtaining to see the gone-wrong 'heros' wreck havoc on the house. Hush-Puppy, as usual, is not exactly the main character, but he is in this video, wise-cracking in his one-of-a-kind voice. Lambchop and Sheri make latkes and sing together in the kitchen, and all the 'kids' anticipate the chocolate gelt. They hold their annual play (the story of Hannukah), and there are three guest stars that play Sheri's friends who attend the supper. All in all, this is an informative, cute, and over-all fun video! Please don't give it bad reviews- I love it too much."
1,A terrible textbook,"Whoever wrote this book has a great idea in having students actually working things out to find solutions, but to expect students to discover in an hour what geniuses discovered after many years is unrealistic. There are little to no examples, no glossary, and the hints are useless in helping the student understand the concept. All in all, a very poor book."
1,Terrible text,"I have taught HS and college level Math for many years. I have never encountered a less user-friendly text. It is only with complete arrogance that an instructor or district would adopt this text. No examples to speak of, no odd-numbered answers in the back, no glossary (!), hints that don't help. How would anyone say that this is a good way to teach? Instead it sets up students for failure. If you are looking for a supplemental resource instead of a text, keep looking. There is no value to this text as a supplement since there is nothing that is self-explanatory."
2,No glossary causes trauma,"I am an AP Geometry student. This book does not have a glossary...though the point is to learn by yourself, what is the harm in having a reference to go back to later on in the book when you can't quite remember what a certain term meant?"
1,"Stupid, Childish Book","This book was the bane of my existence throughout 9th Grade Geometry. Having had a year of a real math book this year I am finally able to realize just how stupid the book was. It treats the student like he or she is about two years old, does not provide the information necessary for exam review, and is far too colloquial in general. In addition, it has no answers in the back, just ""Hints"" in the back of the book that either do nothing at all to help or solve the problem completely without explanation. It also says ""SHAME ON YOU"" if one looks at the hints without first trying the problem. Personally, I don't enjoy being chastized by a math book, especially one with such a bad approach to Geometry,"
1,Useless,"I taught geometry for a year and was burdened with having to use this book. The level of the book never is challenging enough for a regular level high school geometry class, let alone an honors one. It does virtually no reinforcement of principles of algebra--something that is very important at this level. I ended up creating vaast supplements to make up for the books weaknesses. Run away from this book as fast as you can."
1,Not A Good Book,"This book does not help the student learn. It wants them to ""discover"" definitons and methods by looking at pictures and diagrams. This theory fails miserably. I find it very difficult to discover how to construct things and definitons just by looking at pictures. Conjectures with blanks, no glossary, and an unhelpful Helpful Hints Sections add on to the trouble. DO NOT GET THIS BOOK FOR YOURSELF OR FOR YOUR CLASS."
4,Discovering Geometry,"The ship came within the time the seller said it would. I only found out the shipment time after placing the order and submitting it. However I wished the shipment time could have been shorter because the item was really needed within a few days of ordering. I am new to ordering on-line so I have not learned all the quick ways of getting a turn around response that is best to meet the needs of my family. The item was in very good condition and that was helpful. Overall, I was satisfied!"
2,IT WORKS BUT DIFFICULT TO READ,"This tool does work. However, it's difficult to read the measurements. As a technician, I need to read the measurements quickly. This tool does do what it says but trying to read the brake pad thickness takes too long to decipher."
2,So so opening book,"This is a run of the mill opening book. Most chess opening books are junk and this is no exception. The books lacks text on common tactical themes or endgames that result from the openings that make an opening book great. Some of that games reviewed lack basic text on the strategic plans for each side. Being short on ideas and strategy this leaves only the game theory to look at and many games are lacking the insight a good annotator could provide. The writing is also dry at best.As a class player and chess coach, I would not recommended this book."
2,Don't trust his analysis!,"I've only read a few pages of the book, but it's already clear, that Flear didn't computer-check his analysis.For example on page 11 after1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Nxe4 6.d4 b5 7.Bb3 d58.dxe5 Be6 9.c3 Bc5 10.Nbd2 0-0 11.Bc2 Nxf2 12.Rxf2 f6 13.exf6 Bxf2+14.Kxf2 Qxf6 15.Nb3 Ne5 16.Nc5 Bg4 (given ?!) 17.Qxd5+ Kh8 18.Qe4 g6he suggests 19.Bg5 (""!!"") and says: ""My own clear improvement on the theoretical continuation Bh6"".But it actually loses after 19...Qxg5 20.Qxa8 Qf4 with a winning attack according to Toga II (-3.59).Another example is on page 12 (first 14 moves as above)15.Kg1 Rae8 16.Qf1 Bg4 17.Qd3 (He says he feels uncomfortable with this for black)here he gives 17...Ne5 18.Qxh7+ (+0.37)but misses 17...Re1+. Toga II gives 18.Nf1 Bxf3 19.Qxh7+ Kf7 20.gxf3 Ne5 as best play (-1.33).It might be a good training exercise to find the errors in this book,but don't use it as an opening guide without an engine."
1,Terrible Product - Back it goes,This is a great product for REMOVING make-up. I tried this and it did nothing but make my finished make-up oily and with one touch it was completely gone from my face. Awful. Back it goes.
4,Comes with 2 in the package,"I wish I had read other reviews before ordering. It comes with two in one package (I ordered two so now have to return one). It is gray plastic, not stainless steel like I thought from looking at the picture. It'll fix my shower door, but won't look as nice as the previous clear one that was originally installed. On the plus side, it is half as much as I thought, considering I thought I had to order two!"
5,Shower Door Bottom Guides,"This fit onto the bottom of the door just like it was made for it and it works great. The only thing I would change is, in the advertisement, it should be mentioned that there are two guides in each package."
1,terrible service from this vendor,Product was defective. Vendor refused to assist in resolving the issue. I decided to throw product away rather than dispute the small dollar purchase.
4,It Was So Long Ago,"I was little but I still remember ""Tragic Romance"", ""Hangman's Boogie"" and ""Signed, Sealed and Delivered"" (not to be confused with the later Stevie Wonder hit) but I still go to my twenty-dollar reissued 45 vinyl for ""Candy Kisses"" by George Morgan as it was GM's signature song. And ""Tennessee Waltz"" is Patti Page's. Sorry, Cope. There weren't all that many ""superstars"" when Copas was recording but he had a steady issue of fundamental country music done in a way that touched people. Those songs as I recall them are right here and I recommend this compilation. The last song I remember by this man is ""Goodbye Kisses"", a heartfelt tune, from about a year before his plane crash which also took his contemporary Hawkshaw Hawkins and country legend Patsy Cline. He is well worth remembering."
4,Very funny at times but not exactly a classic,"Scott Hansen is a pretty funny comic, no doubt about that, and this album is worth picking up if you're looking for a new stand-up album that you haven't already heard or seen a dozen times on Comedy Central.This was originally recorded in the mid 90's, as a part of series of ""The Comedy Gallery Presents"" recordings featuring some prominant comics from the Mid-West. Hansen's album was the strongest of all the recordings. Most of his material is regards to life in the Mid-West, particularly Minnesota. Being 15 years old, not the material holds up, but most of his jokes about the people, weather, and food of the region are still pretty funny. It's not the most intellectual humor, but it's good folksy kind of material that Jeff Foxworthy fans would appreciate, albeit a bit dirtier. Definitely worth adding to your digital collection."
2,To Whom It May Concern,"Despite what Peter says, these may be by the original artists but they are NOT the original versions!"
3,Re-recording for the most part.....,"VanRock is correct. Some of the songs are original performances also, but most are re-recorded by the original artists. The Fortunes' ""You've Got Your Troubles"" is an original performance most of the others are re-recordings by the original artists...I went through this with a Foundations 'best of' cd about ten years ago, and have been eagle-eyeing everything since then....I accepted this one because of the K-TEL label nostalgia and I collect 'different version' type stuff now....but it really doesn't suprise me what folks do to make a buck these days.....lolI've listened more closely now, and ALL the songs are re-recorded. Very close, but not the original recordings....some aren't even close! Sorry for not listening closer the first time, folks! I compared some of the songs with ones I already have that ARE the original recordings and found that all are Re-recordings. Once again, I'm Sorry about this!"
4,Great Production needs more depth,"This one was tough to rate. The audiobook has excellent production values; Blair Brown and David McCallum turn in their usual superb performances. A well written script clearly describes the immediacy and poignantcy of the disaster. But still, I would have liked at least another tape's worth of details about Pompeii/Herculaneum and what archaeologists have been able to piece together about Roman life in the first century AD/CE. Also some allusion to the controversy in archaeological circles about conservation of the sites vs tourism might be in order. Given this is an audio version of a Time/Life book that's probably too much to ask. I think that 5 stars for the cast and production and 3 stars for content is about right."
5,Awesome!!!,This product works great! No more scrapes and bruises...these stay on tight and will protect your little one! I highly recommended anyone topurchasethese. Great price too!
4,"West of Kabul, East of New York","A fine, engaging book that offers insights into Afghanistan and its people and the current world condition. Along with The Kite Runner, the people of Afghanistan come to life for many of us who have no, or little, prior knowledge of this part of the world. On a larger scale, the book is touching and true about the human condition anywhere. Well written, often amusing, this is a warm memoir."
5,understandings for a different age,"If you seek to better understand the conflicts we have with the Arab world, this book is a highly worthwhile read. They author, who has parents from the US and Afghanistan, tells a gripping story of his upbringing is his dual world. Through his insightful and compassionate eyes, we better understand the struggles of today. This book is not about embracing one party line or the other; it is simply a brilliant explanation of the differences that lead us into conflict."
5,An autobiography about a man entrenched in two cultures,"West of Kabul, East of New York is an autobiography about a man entrenched in two cultures, seemingly stuck between his Afghan roots and his experience as an American immigrant. Tamin Ansary recalls his boyhood life in Afghanistan, describes his venture into the San Francisco hippie scene of the `70s and his travels throughout the Middle Eastern world of Islam in an effort to define his own spirituality. Ansary's impassioned email, written the day after the 9/11 attacks, reached millions of Americans and the author's own story is an effort to bridge the ever-widening gap between his heritage and his adopted home. Tamim's story is fascinating, at times frightening and always informative."
4,"West of Kabul, East of New York: An Afghan American Story is a good read.",A friend who is working in Kabul suggested that I read this book. Another friend who saw that I was reading it told me that the author is the cousin of a colleague! It's a small world. The book is a good read and I would suggest that anyone who is interested in culture and learning about Afghan Americans read it. It's a quick read and worth the time.
5,Highly recommended,Published in 2002 but still in 2013 remains engrossing and highly informative about recent and contemporary Afghanistan and about author Tamim Ansary's childhood life there and his subsequent ongoing interaction with the land of his birth (Afghanistan) from the land of his birthright citizenship (United States). Ansary is a gifted writer. The journey through the book goes quickly. Be prepared for this account to seize you and not let go until the last page.
3,Too Long,The beginning of the book was very interesting. I could see this as a magazine article. The longish narrative of a travelogue did not work as well for a book. I skimmed the second half of the book and really didn't care what happened. Point was made early.
5,Fantastic,"This summer my husband and I were dining in a small restaurant in Queretaro, Mexico and heard this CD being played. Ms. Mouskouri's voice was so clear and beautiful that I left thinking that I just had to get a copy of this CD. I especially like the selection, En Aranjuez con mi amor. We have this piece as an instrumental, but her voice and the lyrics just set it alive.If you are considering buying this CD for yourself, don't deprive yourself another day! You won't be disappointed."
5,Joel Osteen Book,I'm so glad I ordered this book! It's amazing and helpful. I have ordered it for my grandsons who need some help in their lives. I recommend this book highly! Joel Osteen is amazing!
4,GOOD USED BOOKS,"AS ALWAYS, THE USED BOOK I BOUGHT WAS IN GREAT CONDITION, AND WAS RECEIVED IN A TIMELY FASHION"
1,DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER - THE BOOKS LOOKED USED,I like Joel Osteen spiritual words but I am very dissatisfied with the quality of the books I received. They were very old looking with lots of black marks on the pages. The books were bought as a birthday present but looks so used I left as if I purchased second hand books. I am very unhappy with the quality of books I received since I specifically ordered NEW Books
4,Good Thoughts and Ideas,"I like this book, it made me think of some things in different way and gave me some ideas for building up my business"
5,The Referral of a Lifetime,This is an excellent book for everyone in MLM industry. It will show you how to build a business without spending any money. I have given the book to many of my friends
5,Golden Rule in real life sales,"This book is a blueprint for putting the Golden Rule into your business. This is just what I have been looking for, validation that you can do the right thing AND make money."
3,Borrow it if you can,"If you know someone who already has this book, see if they will loan it to you for a few hours. You can easily blow thru reading it in that time. I'm saying this, and I don't consider myself to be a speed reader either. :) I agree with the person who said that if the type was smaller it would be a pamplet, and for me, the story line starts out being a delightful little read, but quickly becomes somewhat elementary and redundant in the way that it draws things out. I do see some value from this book for those just beginning in business to solicit sales, and it re-enforces very good ideals. This is not a book you'd really need to keep around to refer back to as you could easily jot down the points it makes on a single sheet of paper and refer back to them if need be. The points are basic, but vague, and truely lack in the ""how to"" department regarding specifics in any given business or product. So, just borrow it if you can, as I didn't feel it was worth the price they are asking."
5,very much enjoying,Yeah likes lots. I am a bluegrass buff anyway and I enjoy the isaacs music lots anyway. You have a thumbs up from me.
4,Bought on a Recommendation,"My daughter-in-law recommended several Gospel ""bluegrass"" artists to me. This one hits the mark! Lots of up-beat stuff without the whiny steel guitars."
5,Superb Bluegrass Collection of Oldies,"If you love bluegrass and God, you have the winning ticket here! Beautifully performed and lacking nothing you would desire. Well worth the expenditure for countless hours of down home, porch rocking, Sunday best recollection."
5,Measuring Behavior,A must have for anyone doing research on animal behavior. An excellent text. Highly recommend it.
5,Great book,"I totally agree with Marti. This line of books is fabulous. The patterns are so much fun to make and so good to use for gifts, etc. I even like to just take all three and browse through them time and again, because they are so beautiful and well produced.Buy all three seasons of them. They are worth every penny paid."
2,Shih Tzu & Pekinese ate them in less than 5 minutes!,These treats are tiny and break apart easily....my Shih Tzus & Pekingese ate them in less than 5 minutes! Very expensive for only 300 seconds teeth cleaning and fun.
3,"nice watch, uncomfortable watchband","I looked everywhere for a ladies watch that showed the date and day and wasn't huge. This watch is attractive, it has a clear day/date window, shows the seconds, so far it is keeping good time, and was incredibly cheap.But the problem is, the band is very uncomfortable. It is heavy, stiff, has sharp edges, and pinches skin and hairs when putting it on and off or moving it on the arm. You can't tell any of that from the picture, of course.I thought I would just replace the band but it turns out to be impossible because of the way the band attaches to the watch.So I am wearing it for now but it is not comfortable, and it REALLY hurts the back of my hand when I put it on or off, because of the sharp edges.If it hadn't been so cheap, I would return it.The only way I would recommend this is to someone with tough skin. It's too bad, because the watch itself looks nice and works great."
2,cool,the band parts startet to jump off of the watch.i bought it in august.by september the firstpart jumped off.my lady hand isnt fat nor she is a fat person for us to understand the band links are on its lasts for elasticity.so i would say it isnt no rolex watch or bretling
4,Deac0ns,This is really a good guide for young deacons and members with the heart to serve. Give this read a try
4,damaged,"i never received the book but my i got my money back quick, they said it was to damage to sell."
3,Fun but too easy,"I purchased this toy for my husband who is a total whiz at games like this. I was a bit disappointed since this one seemed so easy. He's had some that he really has to work at, and I was hoping this one would be harder than it was"
3,Not bad for the $,"It's cheap, it's 19"". Looks pretty good. Nowhere near the 21"" Sony I had at work. Text is not perfectly sharp and it doesn't do 1280x1024@85."
3,Highways to a War,"The book is interesting, but I downloaded the online Kindle version and it is so full of typographical errors and incorrect punctuation that it is sometimes difficult to get through the text. Not sure if the print version has some of the same issues or not. The book is one of several that were recommended as background for a trip I took to Cambodia."
5,rich and haunting,"as an expat Australian and a prolific reader of fiction, I just want to remark that I think this the most moving piece of fiction to come out of Australia, ever. This is the only review I've ever written on Amazon, but this book has stayed with my over the years unlike any other work of oz fiction. I'd temper this by saying it is likely more appealing for a male rather than female audience, given the subject matter. Sweeping, embellished narrative that some might see as old fashioned. But just a terrific book, and a candidate for greatest ever novel by an Australian author."
1,Koch's Worst...Yet?,"After reading this book, I was fairly disappointed that i had spent my week's pocket money buying it. Koch's attempt at trying to create intrest in a theme (war) that is by now fairly tired is a sad effort. The book has no appeal, and on many occasions i was diverted for reading to something more interesting (like taking out the garbage). I strongly reccomend that you look at his earlier writing efforts if you are in search for a good read."
3,A little too late,"Pretty easy to follow at some points but suddenly the books throws things at you and expects you to ""discover"" how to solve it. The answer and the easiest way to approach the answer shows up in the next or following sections/chapters. I shouldn't be wasting my time trying to discover something that was discovered centuries ago. Had I not taken a self-paced course, I probably would not have been dissapointed by the book. The instructor would have helped. Also, some references for the HP calc. would have been nice."
3,Where's the David Guetta mix?,"Hot song and video, but the David Guetta remix of ""I've Got a Life"" is amazing. Too bad they didn't include it and/or some of the others here for this price."
4,a great sci-fi/horror classic,"This movie is a great example of why the 50's and early 60's were the era of great sci-fi films. The story is imaginative and compelling. The look of the children, the way they were conceived, and their mysterious intentions all give this movie that particular weird, creepy sort of feeling that old black and white horror and sci-fi movies convey so well. The ending of this movie is way cool also. The sci-fi movies being cranked out by Hollywood today can not come close to this one. Big budget special effects and computer graphics might impress the masses, but they aren't at all weird or creepy. I'll take a movie like this over one of those flashy but boring and generic new ones any day!"
2,Dissapointing,"I looked forward to seeing the film version of John Wyndham's book, ""The Midwich Cuckoos"", and was quite dissapointed when I finally did so. The film failed to create a sense of horror, by rushing through some key scenes and leaving others out altogether. Many consider this film to be truly frightening, and a classic of the horror genre, but I feel that true horror in a movie comes mostly in the suspense. Not in the horrific actions the monsters ARE engaging in, but the wondering of what exactly will those actions be, and when and where will they occur. A few slap dash moments of glowing eyes folllowed by a quick murder or two don't add up to horror for me. I found myself growing increasingly bored by this film, which is suprising considering how short it is. From the first moment the action occurs way to rapidly; no time is given to slowly unveil the horror, bit by bit. I was left with the overall feeling: who cares?"
4,Klipsch AW-525 75W White Outdoor Speakers (pair),"I connected these speakers to a Sonos ZP120, in an outdoor area. The sound is crisp and clear even on low volume. The quality of the product is exceptional and it looks good. I can highly recommend this to anyone seeking a pair of good outdoor speakers."
5,Great 30s group,If you like authentic music from the American song book the Boswell's have a place in your collection. These women had an intuitive ability to bring synergy to their performance. (They really were sisters). Their southern upbringing is evident and their rhythm and teamwork is frankly delightful. Highly recommended.
1,Three Cubans,"Three Cubans Old video,Is not the reality of today in Cuba.Today we have another generation that wants to know the true about Cuba .Not old movies. (we are in 20007)The past is past."
5,Hooked on that Henry Sound,"This CD is one that I don't get tired of. These guys are incredibly talented musicians, and the lyrics are intelligent and witty. I love it--you will too."
1,Not worh it,"This book is a hopeless waste of trees.Its the type of stock you might put on your bookshelf to impress your boss, but quickly remove when he leaves your cube to keep from embarassing yourself in front of coworkers."
4,Readable and Relevant,"I did not like ""The Road Ahead"" but I truly enjoy this book. One may not agree with Microsoft's marketing tactics in certain situations, but this book reconfirms my perception that Microsoft is staffed with intelligent and energetic people, from the top down, who can make things happen quickly and analytically. True to their ""eat your own dog food"" philosophy, they make digital business practices happen in their own company first. Bill Gates' observations and strategies are relevant, at least for the next 10 years of Internet-based business transactions. What he writes may be trivial to some, but big profits have also been made with water alone. To maintain balance, I must add that predictions of timing are hard. The fact that this book is still in paper format indicates that not everything will be digital anytime soon."
4,"A rate of the book, not the man.","I thought the book was pretty good. It's not the best piece of literature I've ever read, but it wasn't as bad as the ""Bill Bashers"" make it sound. Some of the people who claim this book is ""poorly written"", ""horrible"", or ""a waste of money"" need to upgrage their standards from ""The Cat In The Hat"" and take an English Literature class or two to appreciate an author's work. Like the man or not, the writing wasn't bad at all."
1,It is rather pathetic,"The book is another example case and point of Bill Gates lack of foresite into actually usable material. The book is filled with knowledge that has been wide spread even before his hand hit the page to write it. Boring, and dry as all his books this one is definately a waste of hard earned money."
1,A fluff book,"Once again Bill Gates has released an over-hyped book. Although there is quite an intelligence present throughout the book's structure and there can be much gained from reading this book, the overall is still yet another ""celebrity"" attempting to write."
1,Horrid Book,"Really bad. No new ideas, much of it even outdated. Spend your money on something worthwhile, like O'Reilly books."
3,"As usual, no new ideas from Bill.","Most of what are written in the book are already well known to the business society, there are really nothing new in the book other than an appealing title."
4,For Professional Business Managers NOT Info Tech People!,"The people who don't like this book are IT geeks who arelooking for big vision from Gates. While it is true that Mr. Gatesdoesn't offer a revolutionary new IT toy in this book---he does professional managers a great service by providing a framework for using information technology to improve business.Good book, it gave me some great ideas!"
3,Interesting to read but .... only for top people,"I find the book to be quite interesting but not really relevant for normal people....I think this book is only meant for CIOs, CEOs, CFOs... they are the one that are able to propose such huge investments in Digital Nervous System !!At the last part of the book, Digital Nervous System is compared against the older methodology ""Business Re-engineering"" without giving some background about what Business Re-engineering actually means......Anyway, reader need to have some sense of business before reading this... there are plenty of business terms."
4,"A good, solid read.","I got an advance copy and was dubious after ""The Road Ahead."" This was a pleasant surprise, and worth reading. Some keen observations and a few exciting ideas. For those of you who neither evangelize nor demonize Microsoft, this is something to add to your reading list."
5,The bible of High technology management,Great book by great man. I would say the way Gates presented his thoughts by real-life examples is extra ordinary. I think great men like him should always write books like this.
2,A Sleeper,"Compared to leading edge publications (University texts, IT Journals), Gates' view of the connected ""nervous"" system infrastructure is hardly visionary. Perhaps if he had published these thoughts a decade ago his material would be interesting. If you keep abreast with IT issues, you WILL find this book very slow and without revelations."
5,Inspiring book,"Very inspirational. Gates combines Andrew Deming's total quality management style with today's connected network. If a company is going to survive in today's world it must use a ""the digital network""."
1,PHB Fodder,"Do you remember that 90's Dilbert strip where the boss is listening to tapes on management-speak? In the strip, the boss repeats phrases and sentences as if it were a foreign language, and becomes gradually more confident with verbose, quasi-technical jargon. This was the first thing I thought of while listening to this book.If you are looking to study management-speak as a foreign language, _Business @ The Speed of Thought_ is likely to be the next best thing to a Berlitz course. Otherwise, it's a completely unremarkable business book that has a bit of future prophecy. The observations and predictions do date this book; 1999 predictions about knowledge-workers and about using the internet for education seem uninspired at best."
3,More Hype than Hope,"The book reveals little as far as technology. It's more like a new-age stream of consciousness than concrete ideas that will keep Microsoft on top. The real Bill Gates is better described in ""The Plot to Get Bill Gates"". This book shows little originality and seems to be the publishing equivalent of vaporware."
1,"Insipid, Vapid, and Stupid","What business ISN'T conducted ""@ the speed of thought?"" [sic] What business hasn't, ever, been conducted ""@ the speed of thought?""This is just another attempt to portray the current business climate as somehow fundamentally different from business 2, 200, 2000, or 20,000 years ago. That, of course, is hogwash. Today's businessmen, Gates included, have a simple goal that they share with their ancestors of centuries ago: Give Me Your Money.You'll find more original ideas on the wall of a barroom commode."
1,Just shoot me,"The best comment for this book came from an editor at ZDNET. To paraphrase, ""Faced with the prospect of having to re-read this book, I'd rather have my brain (gouged) out with a plastic fork."""
4,A must read,"Like anything Bill does, it is closely followed by a good proportion of the planet (possibly others!). This is no exception. Because of who he is and what he has done this is A MUST READ, but at the same time a usefull one, for the CEO and the student."
3,to be or not to be,"I think the the idea is easily understaned but difficulty to do.Everyone knows we must react quickly,but don't know how to do.Frankly to say, it is not a theriacal book,but useful. Most important,I think GATES really a businessman"
1,Banal fodder for clueless rubes,"A facile book cynically written for the legions of poor cubicle slobs toiling away in the hope of getting a competitive ""edge."" Duh! The edge here was never more than a simple case of a scary personality disorder gone amok. Computation and connectivity have nothing to do with the success of Bill Gates. As with all Microsoft products, this book is simply other people's ideas, rebranded and hyped to create demand out of thin air. Just climb up on your roof, open your wallet and throw your money into the wind. Same effect."
1,A big disappointment,"I expected a lot from this book. It is after all by a person considered a thought leader by many. Unfortunately it seems more like a book written to take advantage of Bill Gates' big draw name, with nothing new or insightful in it.I would be quite embarrassed to put my name on this book. It basically tries to put forward a fancy framework for corporate and global networks. In other words, the internet, something Microsoft famously completely missed the boat on and is still to this day trying to catch up on. Don't waste your time or your money, other than as a lesson in how corporates often completely miss the forest for the trees, especially when they own a very lucrative monopoly on a small piece of a much bigger picture.There's nothing new or insightful here. Here's the short version to save you a whole lot of time trying to decipher the ""insight"": ""Networks are good for business."" Profound isn't it?"
3,Insightful,"We found the concepts in Gates & Hemingway (2000) ""Business at the Speed of Thought: Succeeding in the Digital Economy"" interesting and helpful for business planning and development. Creating a ""digital nervous system"" seems a lofty ideal and a little too technical and impersonal though.We would have liked to see more business examples outside of the Microsoft examples they cited.What we also liked about this book is that it offers a brief glimpse into the mind and thinking of one of the most successful businessman in history. For anyone interested in business/leadership biography, this is a worthwhile read."
2,Marketing Knock-Off,"Typical of Bill Gates' style, it's a knock-off of other ideas that put the Microsoft spin. Most of these concepts from a view that would appeal to the executives and managers (that such a book targets) are presented more clearly in James Martin's CyberCorps and several other books on the subject..."
1,"If you look up a horses ass, what do you expect to find?","I was taken, do you think it is likely that I could get my money back from the world's richest man? Does this guy really think that PC's are the savior? His thinking will create problems that will make Y2K look like a typo"
2,"Old ideas, new format","Old ideas of a ""PC centric"" world rewritten to add the internet. very average book, unless you have never used the web in a work environment, you won't discover anything new (thus the 2 star rating), except the confirmation that this is even more a 400-page sales brochure for microsoft that ""the road ahead was""."
1,Understanding a truth,"This book should enlighten the readers to the dismal and shallow nature of Microsoft the company and their Leadership.Microsoft the Company, one of the largest in the World and their founder Bill Gates, one, if not the richest men in the world. Has shown that it's hard to disguise his true nature to mature and knowledgeable readers.Bill Gates proves that it's easier to write software that semi-works and sale it to people via marketing hype than to personally write a book that says anything that represents intelligence."
4,A Good Starting Point,"Unless you already know everything there is to know about the internet, this is a good book to help you set your business on the right path.Maybe not for the ""tecno-elite"", but definitely worthwhile for everyone else."
1,Mostly Fluff,I am surprized that this book sits at the top of popularbusiness books. There are a few solid ideas and comments on thevelocity of information but the rest is pabulum. This book was written for 7th graders and I was expecting more.
4,Business Competitive Advantage in 21th Century,"Business Competitive Advantage Map in 21th Century : 1.Internet:E-Commerce 2.IT(Information Technology):Data Wearhousing,Data Minering 3.Personal Line Service:Consumer Service,Consumer Satisfy"
2,Just bill selling his business!,"i couldn't wait to read this book and did so in the first day i received it. what a dissapointment. i really felt that this book is bill's attempt at getting businesses to move technologically into the 21st century (this is not a bad thing). he doesn't give any real insights and many times you get the impression that he is just trying to give his twist to the bad things you have heard about microsoft (i.e., late getting on the internet, etc.). i was really let down. i did like his one chapter on education (short and not what the book was intended for, at least by the title). i would not recommend this book to anyone, especially business people. if they don't know they should move into the technological age, then they don't deserve to have their business survive!"
1,Poor Book,There is no initiative that lets you continue reading the book. I think of it as a poor descriptive book.
2,Wishful thinking..,"Bill's wishful world. Much of what is stated is co-opted from others, much is clever restatement, and much is an MS commercial. These are the good parts of the book. The rest of the content (a very small portion thereof) is filled with a scattering of implied 'nuggets' of Gates wisdom -which, by the way, are probably wrong. He created a great OS platform, but ultimately I think that gives him little insight into what the future of technology is; and the quicker he moves out of the OS software arena, the quicker MS is going to see its downfall. If you want proof of this, then you've got a reason to read the book."
1,Buy Michael Dell's book instead,"The problem with Bill Gates is that there is simply nothing original or insightful in that empty head of his. ...in this book, he oversimplifies and tries to synthesize what other, more thoughtful thinkers on the subject of the future of business have already said. If you want to read a great business story and learn some tried-and-true, valuable strategies for managing in the information age, buy Michael Dell's book instead."
3,Something is missing,"The book provides a really interesting look at how to become a fully digital company. However, it does not address what seem to me to be central issues: How do I successfully compete in this new world? How do I ensure that my customers stay with me? The best complement to Gates' book that I have found is ""HyperWars: 11 Strategies for Survival and Profit in the Era of Online Business"" by Bruce Judson with Kate Kelley. Judson and Kelley go straight at all of the hard problems that Gates ignores."
4,"In hindsight, relevant.","Although Bill Gates continues to have his haters, his book, Business @ the Speed of Thought, is, in hindsight, still relevant. His predictions are on target. The internet really has revolutionized how we do EVERYTHING! Increasingly, the business community - the private and the public sectors - rely on the internet for business traffic. Like him or not, he knows what he's talking about. And his book offers some interesting insights for business owners, business managers and anyone else looking to make substantial changes and/or improvements to their existing business models. Definitely a keeper!"
4,Lessons Learned,I wished I read the book in the late 90s. Most of what Bill Gates said is true today.
2,telling...,"Gates has missed the cluetrain. Microsoft is still engaging in the us against them corporate mentality, and this book reveals why. He's so focussed on the boardroom mentality that he seems to have no clue what his CUSTOMERS want. It's all about how the internet can serve the company, rather than how the company can fill the needs of the community."
3,Too many examples,"How can IT improve your business? That's the question that Bill Gates tries to answer in this book, by describing plenty of successful technology implementation stories.If you are a CIO the book you'll find the book a little naive, but if you're an IT enthusiast you will probably like it."
1,Only for an american audience,"This is the typical business book for Americans : filled with examples, very low in concepts. The only motive they have for reading this is the wealth of the author : they think they will be turned into gold by touching a book that is written by the wealthiest man on earth! Does Bill Gates really thinks that we have time for reading 500 pages of boring and obvious stuff that have already been made and provide no guidance as to the future (if that is what you are looking for, which is an error)All reading in the world will not make up for real thinking and action based on a curiosity for the world and an education to frame it."
5,Excellent business book,"Simply put, this is a great book about business and business management in the Information Age. It doesn't set out to reveal the future or make promises. Instead, it gives real world, practical advice and plenty of actual case studies for managers to bring their businesses up to speed technologically. Much of the book's value is for larger companies, but I still got a lot of ideas for my company of 15 employees. I read part of this in my MBA program, and I would highly recommend it to any manager, leader, or student of business."
4,"Das Kapital for the ""Web Lifestyle""","On merit alone, I would have rated it a 2 as it was simply a nice packaging of current principles and observations. I was tempted to take a couple of points off from my indignance over this veiled attempt to reason demand for Office 2000's new capabilities.Office 97 offered little but frustration and cost to Office 95 users and only teased our web appetite. Without the ""web workstyle"" there would be virtually no incremental demand for an Office 2000. But this book explains the reason why we all MUST have Office 2000. To be successful, be like me. To be like me, use tools like I use.But, I gave it four stars because I am pragmatic. Microsoft IS THE MARKET. They rule, so you're better off to simply pick up a copy of Gates Kapital (or Microsoft Kampf for the truly jaded) and understand where the victors are headed. Happy reading Komrads!"
4,Palm TX Styra,"These stylus pens are nice, because you have a pen with your Palm wherever you go. You don't have to carry an pen in your shirt pocket"
5,One hell of a turn on,"I'm totally blown away by how hot and well written these stories are. Bob Vickery has managed to create stories that are not only incredibly sexy, but are also funny, moving, even poignant, and always a good read. Vickery's imagination is amazing; his plots are fresh and original, his characters are very human and three dimensional, and the sex scenes always ring true. I found this book to be a great read."
5,DCC engines are fun,"A great addition to my collection. It's a great little engine that trucks around my layout just as I expected it would. And it came at a great price, too!"
4,Bad experience turned good!,"I ordered these logs in an effort to spruce up our fireplace. Unfortunately, when they arrived one log was broken and I had accidentally ordered the wrong size. I called up and it was taken care of right away. All in all we are very happy."
3,Give deeper meaning to all tarot,"I find that the book and cards give a whole new depth to all the tarot decks major arcana. It gives good insight into the archetypes at work in the tarot. This is a traditional pips based deck, so is all about the Major Arcana rather than the whole deck. So if you are looking for a book that covers all the cards, this is not for you. I do find it good for insights into the other decks, but not a deck I would do a reading with."
5,Startingly Good,I think this is a wonderful book for anyone who wants a very viable theory underlying the tarot. Wang offers a very clear understanding of Jungian theory; he has it down pat!
3,Only partially covers Jungian Tarot deck,"I thought this would be the companion book to the Jungian Tarot cards also by Wang but unfortunately it only includes information on the major arcana. And although it is quite detailed I would have liked some information on the minor arcana, I guess you have to buy another book?"
4,casio db-37 silver,"Its good means only small problem sensitive ""glass"", its wary easily to scratch it"
5,Casio Men's Databank Watch #DB37HD-7AV,"Owned 2 Data Bank 150 watches over the years, and just had great service from them. I found that I don't need that many phone numbers and do not need the calculator. Just love the DB37HD-7AV and the metal strap is quite an improvement over the plastic straps on the DB150."
1,Watch mis-represented (Does not have stainless steel case),"Functionally this watch is great.However, it does not have a stainless steel case as advertised. It is plastic. My son had it for two weeks when it broke. He did a handstand. The Metal band did not give but the plastic did. The pins that hold the band to the watch, ripped out through the plastic on both sides of the watch. It really is not a good idea to put a metal band on a plastic watch. If you are a couch potato, this watch will work for you. If you are active, either buy a different watch or put a more flexible band on it."
2,"Good watch, except for 12/24H button","I have to buy another casio because this one's case isn't metal and finally the pin holding the strap broke through the plastic pin-holder (probably my fault). i won't buy another DB-37h mainly because i sometimes inadvertently press and hold the 12/24H button (for example, while sleeping), which causes the watch to change to DST (which is indicated by a small DST sign) and the time increases by 1 hour. so, occasionally, one goes to events 1 hour early (I guess it's better than getting there one hour late). What idiot thought of this - it totally ruins the watch - all you need for this to happen once."
3,Covers the Bases,"Mr. Baur's book gives a good coherent view of this great American artists life. It includes many black and white renderings of Burchfield's works and a number of colored plates. While not up to present standards for such a book it does present Charles Burchfield's life with a minimum of interpretation using Burchfield's own diary entries and letters to express the artists thoughts. Could be better, an update would be helpful with all Burchfield's works rendered in color. Be sure to visit the new Burchfield art center (as of 2000) at the corner of Union Road and Clinton Street on the banks of the creek that Burchfield so loved in Gardenville New York."
5,Answers all the questions about Resurrection,"Miracles are all around us: life, air, rain, and so on.What purpose do they, as well as creation in general, serve?Does everything exist for a while and then disappear into nothingness, or is it transformed into something eternal?Basing himself on Said Nursi's Risale-i Nur, Ali Unal presents a scientific and logical argument for the validity of one of religion's main elements of faithTherefore, I strongly recommend to everybody interested in hereafter."
5,Great book!,"I had the pleasure of taking this class at the University of Missouri with Dr. Hudson-Weems. This book changed my perspective on how I view my relationship with black men and the black struggle as a whole. If you're into black literature, you would remiss without this book. It gives you a whole new approach and perspective on how to read and decode the clues written between the lines of black ""feminist"" theory. You'll see people like Bell Hooks, Audre Lorde, Maya Angelou, and Iyanla Vazant in a whole new light."
5,must watch.,All serious golfers must watch this DVD. Beginners and scratch doesn't matter. You will come away with a better swing concept and trust in your fundamentals.joel
5,Happy,"Happy with the book general tenure. No page missing, no tear. For the price, it was definetely a good deal."
5,A Knock at Midnight,"This is the best book I have ever read. It was received the best condition and I can now be a better pastor, preacher, teacher and leader because the sermons of Dr. king. This is a must read anyone who is considering ministry. While the battles that Dr. King fought are no longer around, there are still battles, and he teaches you from his experiences and the gospels how to fight for justice; for peace and for righteousness all while in pursuit of a ""United States"" of America."
5,I wish I could give this EXPERIENCE 10 stars!,"Notice I refer to the cassettes and the companion book as an EXPERIENCE as I both listened to and read the REVEREND King! Although the media focused on the visible part of his ministry, the civil rights movement, his sermons are profound and awesome in their implications for today as well as their in their powerful delivery during the mid-1950's through 1960's. Although I will cherish both the cassette series and the book, it is through hearing the SPEAKING of Dr. King that really made me breathless! Thank you LORD God for sending us your messenger Dr. King to give us a wonderful earthly ministry for a brilliant and brief time (much like Jesus Christ). Simply awesome!"
3,interesting,Story about inner world with advance technology. If you like ancient aliens and secret high tech civilization you will enjoy it. Is short and low paced. Not much action here. Suppose to be real.
4,Educational...,"But we have had a couple of the buttons stop working. Luckily one is the hand and the other is the ear so we just have to tell our daughter to push the left one instead. So it is effective in teaching left and right, because the right one is broken! It does well teaching children memorization and it can even stump my husband and I (level 6&7). We don't like the fact that as the music ends you can not make a guess, making it harder for the youngest users (18 months-2 years), who need a little more thought process, to guess correctly. Overall we are pretty glad that we purchased this product."
2,Not what I was looking for,"Years ago I had a cookbook that had recipes from well know retreats. I was looking for a recipe for ""Green Chili Stew"". I was unable to see which recipes were in this book before purchasing. Unfortunately, the one I wanted was not here. I was disappointed even though the recipes are good."
3,Hit & miss utterly unedited stream of consciousness goonery,"Stream of consciousness goonery, utterly unedited, not even the vaguest attempt at a plot. In the introduction Milligan describes it as,""... the first freeform comic fantasy in which the subconscious mind is the author.""He describes the process of writing, introducing his co-author as,""...friend, pianist and fellow manic depressive. We decided that whenever either of us was on a down we would write `something' in book form. The result was this book.""As a result it's totally hit and miss - and the pleasure is also largely dependent on the mood of the reader: I found some parts hilarious and others merely confused, but I suspect if I read it again I'd have the same reactions to different parts of the text. Definitely only to be read, as it was written, in small portions (I don't think Spike would be at all offended to find I chose to read it in the smallest room in the house)."
4,Crabmeat Stuffed Sole Fillets with Saffron Cream Sauce...,"... if that isn't enough to make a person want this cookbook I don't know what it would take. You say you want more? Okay, I was born and brought up looking out over the San Francisco Bay and I consider it most beautiful, but this book made me want to visit the Chesapeake Bay area and get to know its rich history and its evidently warm and hospitable people, profiled in brief well-written essays in each chapter. Good black and white photographs of people and places, a nicely drawn map at the front of the book, and recipes that speak of tradition and family in the best American way like Mrs. Tovey's Chicken and Waffles with Gravy, and Tangy Peach Short Ribs of Beef. I can't imagine anyone would be sorry to have this book, once they opened the covers and began to read."
5,The Sculptress,"This is an engaging book that draws you into the story immediately and rivets your attention. I think Minette Walters is one of the best mystery writers I've ever come across. I would highly recommend any of her books. If you like PD James, you will love Minette Walters."
2,OVERRATED !!!,"I don't understand what so special about this book. The first half of the book is quite exciting. But in the later half - especially towards the ending - it becomes complicated, boring, almost incomprehensible.The restaurant part of the story is so unnecessary and has nothing (or just a little bit) to do with the main storyline. The 'Olive doing her carvings and sticking pins on wax figures' constantly repeated and has nothing to do with the storyline. The conclusion is very confusing. We can never be so sure why the killer killed.Sorry......this book is not good enough.take Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine anyday......."
3,the sculptress,"I couldn't wait to get this book ! I had read so many good reviews. The first 200 pages were so good that I could not read fast enough. Then it kind of went off the tract talking about the writers boyfriend's trouble, adding a whole lot of unnecessary characters. As though there weren't enough characters already. But where it really lost it for me was the ending.The person who actually committed the murders had no motive against the people who were killed and in no way would have the physical stength to kill these people in the manner in which they were killed. It's one thing to not have it be the first person who you suspect. You need some kind of suspense. But when the murderer is ridiculous that wrecks a book for me no matter how well it is written."
4,Perfect Commuter Reading,"This was the first Minette Walters book I have read and I have bought all her others since reading The Sculptress.The characters are well descibed and vivid, the story is a well-blended mix of mystery, emotion, fact and speculation.Walters does not rely on a formula to help her writing output and each of her books comes across as fresh and unique.This is the perfect book to make you look forward to a daily commute - but keep an eye out for your stop!"
3,Unsatisfactory and unresolved,"I must admit that I was bowled over by this book until the end. Meaning, that the end destroyed the high rating I might have given it. We spend the whole book trying to understand why the murders were committed, and also by whom, but what emerges in the end is only a possible theory. Walters still doesn't explain clearly why the mother was killed, and why both of them were so brutally slaughtered. And the last sentence invites us to rethink the whole 'solution'.So why did I bother to read this book? When it leaves me wondering at the end who did it and why, and whether this woman is really innocent. That's the feeling we have while reading the entire novel. A good mystery should solve everything, explain all the little and big points, and this book fails big time at this.I even re-read the parts where the final theories emerge, but they still left me hanging."
4,Eerie Book with Seductive Writing,This is an eerie novel about an obese woman who confesses to chopping her mother and sister into little pieces and is now spending the rest of her days in jail where she sculpts little figurines.A newspaper writer is given the assignment of writing about the crime. She unenthusiastically accepts it. Her goal is to find the real truth. Both the writer and criminal have skeletons in their closets and they form an odd bond.This Edgar Award winning novel is an interesting book with seductive writing.
