1,This product is not as represented,"I was replacing an existing DCG-12BC that I had used for years. Much to my negative surprise, what i received, which had the same model number as the grinder that i was replacing, had a much smaller basket than the older version of the same model. I like coffee very strong, and the volume of beans that i use were more than would fit easily into the basket. In the older version, the same amount of beans still left about 20% of space. As a result i returned the grinder and bought a different one from a different merchant."
3,It works kinda OK,"The grind is terribly uneven and to get rid of all of the big chunks some of it turns to powder. If you're not a snob about how your coffee is ground, it still chops beans and makes coffee and really, that's the most important thing."
1,Can't believe Cuisinart made this awful product,"There's only 1 thing a coffee grinder should do -- grind coffee well. Like most of the other reviewers, I found that no amount of grinding will produce a grind that can even be considered acceptable. With small batches of beans, the product comes out in chunks of all sizes -- some beans are barely cut in half. Larger batches yeild somewhat better results, but still incredibly uneven. This is an expensive grinder that's not worth a penny."
2,"Sadly, not recommended","This grinder looks great, has some great features, but unfortunately lacks in the most important area. The grind!It has a removable grinding bowl, which is very convenient, especially since it's dishwasher safe. I love that feature. Makes cleaning easy. This grinder also looks great. I love the stainless steel, even if it's a bit larger that other grinders. It's also fairly quiet...at least relative to my last two grinders.Now, the grind. This grinder takes longer than others I've owned and is not that consistent. Sure, it holds a lot of beans at once...one of it's selling points to me. But, as it grinds a full load, it doesn't grind evenly. The fine grounds get packed down below the blades and the top grounds are too coarse. Even with a small load though, it has trouble creating very finely ground coffee....and it takes a while.Sad to say, my final words are, ""not recommended"". If I can find the receipt, I'll be returning this one."
3,Beautiful Design - so-so execution,"The ever helpful Amazon website reminds me that I purchased this item in March 2004. Has it been that long already?! I have raised the rating from 2 to 3 stars given that it has served me reasonably well for 3 years now.This is a beautiful grinder and the stainless steel body gives the impression of ruggedness. But alas, the first thing to go, within a few months was parts of the switch. As a result I have been using it with the switch taped to the lid. It still looks rugged in a bruised up football player kind of way.Now I find pieces of plastic in my grind with the inside of the cup dying a slow death. What is the life of this grinder in coffee grinder years I wonder...."
1,VERY Disappointed!!!,"I have been grinding my own coffee beans every morning for many years and have gone through quite a few different grinders. I have always loved Cuisinart products and was very excited to purchase this one, what a mistake! The grinder itself is really noisy and heavy for it's size. The coffee grinds are never fine enough for my liking and they get stuck up inside the plastic top, making a huge mess and wasting a lot of coffee.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS ONE!!!"
2,"Great idea - just, you know, breaks all the time.","The Grind Central is a fantastic design and idea for a coffee grinder. As one who grinds his own beans, I grow tired of cleaning most grinders - it's just not easy nor designed well. This is. Stainless steel makes it attractive. A nice, sturdy grinding cup. Quiet grinding. Easy - very easy - to clean in the sink or dishwasher.There's just one problem: it breaks.I went through two of these. Like most other people here, after a few grinds the removable cup becomes fused to the base. That means it can't be removed (no matter how hard one tries!) and pretty much defeats the purpose. My first grinder did this after roughly 3 uses; my second, after 5. Clearly there's something wrong with the manufacturing process and/or finer points of the design.It's a real shame because I really did like this grinder. But I'd rather have one that didn't break after a week of use, so I got a cheaper Braun model.Can't recommend this one. If you buy it, you're gambling."
1,Badly made product,"I got this grinder for Christmas, and now it starts to grind itself. The base of the cup spins against the plastic base and produces a love burned plastic smell. I think this item is pretty but poorly designed."
1,Motor died after very few uses,"Same situation as the one told by the previous user.Received as a gift a year ago. We did not use it almost at all until last fall we bought a espresso machine.After maybe less than 20 uses the unit died. As I'm a pretty good handyman I figured a switch failed. Surprise, looks like the electric motor is burned.What a piece of junk. Why do companies like Cuisinart even put such products on the market. It's not rocket scince to test a product for 50 - 100 use cycles. I will never buy a Cuisinart again"
1,A mistake,"I bought this grinder because my husband and I buy whole bean coffee from a supplier in another state. We have had it for a few months and it did alright as others have said ""in large batches,"" however, there's no way to grind a small amount. Now that the blades have gone dull, there's no way to grind ANY amount as most of the beans are either ground to a fine powder or barely nicked. There is no in between, I've even tried re-grinding the barely broken beans to attempt to get usable coffee out of it. No luck. This is a terrible product. I wish I could give it ZERO stars."
1,Shame on Cuisinart,"From the first day it seemed to take forever to grind a moderate amount of coffee. We began getting used to having to put in more coffee and get a weaker brew. The good news is that cheaply made button broke this morning, so we are now free to get an actual coffee grinder instead of this piece of junk."
2,A Lemon,"I was delighted when I got this product, because of the removeable basket and the excellent grind quality. However, it failed after two weeks (it would not operate when the basket was installed, I assume a switch was defective). I decided to simply eat the cost and move on, but it was a huge disappointment because I loved it for the features it offers that few others at this price do. I can't recommend it, tho you may have more luck with it than I did."
1,A waste of good money,"This grinder stopped working during the 1st week after being used only a couple of times. Amazon promptly replaced it without any hassles or added costs. Today, about a year or so later and being used at the most only about 50 times, it just quit in the middle of a routine grinding and will not run again. I still have a 20 year old small Waring grinder which I use for spices that is still as good as new. Based on my experience with the Cuisinart grinder I'll be avoiding all Cuisinart products in the future, as I no longer have faith in this company's ability to maintain an acceptable quality level of their product."
1,Grinder blew a fuse!,"This grinder was a wedding gift two years ago (which I registered for) because I trusted Cuisinart's products (usually) and I didn't need a heavy duty grinder. The first time I used the grinder (a few weeks after I got it, it worked okay, enough to meet my needs). Two years later, I finally had a need to use it again (yep - only used it twice)... and the grinder literally overheated. Feeling the heat one minute and realizing the electrical inside tripped/burnt, I now had a nice paper weight. I didn't bother with trying to return it because I am outside of the 1-year warranty... hmm... maybe that's why there is only a one-year warranty? I definitely recommend NOT buying this product. Spend a little extra and get a grinder that will last longer than two uses."
1,horrible coffee grinder,"I used this coffee grinder for 1 yr and all of sudden it broke.majority of time, u have to stop and stir otherwise coffee doesn't get grind evenly."
1,GARBAGE! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"Needed a new coffee grinder. Boy, did I choose the wrong one!! It broke almost instantly (the motor ""locked"" into grind mode, so the only way to turn it off was to unplug it). So in order to use, I had to plug and unplug, as needed. This morning, while it was grinding my beans, it just died! Total garbage product."
1,Don't be fooled by the nice styling,"This unit is flawed in almost every way other than styling.The stainless grinder cup looks durable, but the plastic guard is too heavy and breaks easily when dropped. The grinder cup doesn't have a deflector to push beans from the bottom up to the top of the cup. So you have to choose between grinding much of the coffee too fine to avoid getting beans that are barely ground at all.The motor is not very durable either. Mine stopped working after about a six-month use with a horrible burnt plastic stench."
3,Cuisinart Coffee Grinder,"Good value for the money. Just wish it had an automatic feature when grinding. You have to press & hold the button to grind the beans. Other than that, Ilike it."
1,Crap!,"I bought this without checking reviews on it first - my bad. I have always had good experiences with Cuisinart, so didn't think I would have problems. I saw that you could take the cup off and wash it - Great idea! I wasn't super thrilled with it, but the box got thrown away so I couldn't return it. It doesn't completely grind all of the beans, even with small amounts grounds work their way under the lip and get all over the place. This morning I was trying to grind the maximum allowable amount - it didn't grind much of anything at all. I dumped half out to try again.....nothing. The motor has burned out. My $19 Hamilton Beach grinder works SO much better."
2,Does not grind for espresso,The ad says it grinds for espresso. Only in Cuisinart's dreams.Returned!!!!
1,Uneven grinding..,"I bought this product based only on the Cusinart name. I thought it would be good due to some pretty good reviews here. After having used it for a couple of years now I still cannot get a good, consistent, even grind from it. I generally have to keep grinding and grinding to get an even grind which is NOT good because it causes heat which can adversly affect the coffee before you even put it into the coffeemaker..In short, this product stinks and I'm sorry I purchased it and I will now probably purchase a Braun."
1,Unfunctional but pretty,"Well---This is the worst ginder I have ever had. It stores terribly as the cord will not go into it's so called retractable storage area in the bottom of the grinder. If you do not keep the removable cup in the grinder, the plastic housing comes tumbling off making it less than ideal for storage. But.....I do have to say it ground the beans well...the design is just plain horrible."
1,Disaster,"I've been through two of these. After about three weeks, both developed the same problem: the bowl won't release from the base."
3,Good but not great,This is the 2nd one I've owned. I use it every day and only grind coffee beans. It is sturdy and reliable but the blade does get dull over time and becomes unstable. The blade wobbles to a point where it slows down and has trouble grinding the beans. It would cost 50% of the new price to buy parts so I just bought a new one.
1,SMOKING COFFEE GRINDER,"This was never a really good grinder to begin with , especially at the price . Now it heats up and started smoking today, with that smell of overheated electric trains at Christmas. The motor finally died after less than one year of use. Avoid !!"
2,Looks aren't everything...,"For the love of God, do not buy this grinder! It is the messiest coffee grinder I've ever used, and it never grinds the beans evenly.The system builds some kind of electrical charge that results in a holy mess--imagine opening the cover only to have powdered coffee explode all over your clothes, countertop and floor. This seems to be the rule rather than the exception. I could probably handle this on a weekly basis (i.e., grind a week's worth of coffee every Sunday evening when I have the time and energy to clean up pulverized beans), but it's really not worth the trouble since the ""grinds"" range in size between a fine Turkish powder and whole bean. No kidding.That said, I give the grinder two stars for the slick brushed steel and black exterior that goes nicely with my coffee pot. After I replace the unit (today), I'll probably cut off the cord and use it as a bookend for my recipe collection."
1,Try another grinder,"I loved the idea of the detachable, washable grinder cup--that way you could use it for spices as well as coffee. But it is designed in such a way that almost everything breaks. I just tossed mine. Sad."
1,stay away,"grinder #1 died the first time we used it to grind 12 cups worth of beans, returned it and received grinder #2 which worked for 11 batches of beans then died.....grinder #2 is in the trash and will avoid Cuisinart coffee related products."
2,"Okay, won't buy again to replace burned out motor","I've had this grinder for over 2 years. It's been okay, like many reviews, it does not grind small batches well at all, leaving large chunks of beans. After the 2+ years, I'm starting to smell burning rubber, so I'm guessing that motor is going to give up soon. I'll be moving on to a nice burr grinder as opposed to a blade grinder. I would not recommend this model."
1,Once upon a time...,"...Cuisinart was known for making excellent applicances, well-designed and durable. If this item is any indication, that time is receding rapidly into the mists of myth. While this is quite a sharp looking grinder, the grinding is not so sharp. It's impossible to produce a proper fine espresso grind. Furthermore, the grinder broke down after several uses: the motor simply seized. I was using the grinder properly, not over-filling. Cuisinart was good enough to send me a replacement...which also died a similar death after a few uses. The third one seems to be holding out thus far, but the motor seems to be becoming noisier with time, which does not bode well for the future. Not recommended."
1,Absolute junk,Motor burned out. Didn't last a month under light use. Didn't grind evenly. An awful product.
2,All looks no function,"This coffee grinder looks great. The problem is the coffee is never ground evenly. There are always big chunks left even after grinding over 30 seconds. If you grind more then that the friction causes the coffee to heat up, so it is not really functional at all. Pre-ground coffee tastes better then anything ground with this machine."
5,great little grinder,We just love this coffee grinder! It is about time someone made one that could easily be taken apart for cleaning. It grinds well and is not too loud. This is the second one I have purchased. It also looks good - which is a nice bonus.
1,Great for grinding wishes,"This was the worst coffee grinder i have ever used. It is easy to clean, as long as you also want to clean the counters because every time you pull out the container, partially ground beans go all over. Fortunately, as many of the other reviewers have said, the grinder sucks, and large chunks of coffee are a bit easier to clean than finely ground, which you will NEVER get from this grinder. Don't waste your money."
1,Disappointment,"I love the design of the product. The removable cup is fantastic. The problem is construction! Mine is slowly dissolving. The plastic bushing on the blade assembly exploded about 4 weeks into use, and little pieces of it got into my coffee. Now it wobbles and makes a terrible noise and vibrates like woah when I use it. It's not long for this world, and I hate it now. I'm looking for a replacement now, which is why I decided to leave a review to warn people away from this wonderfully designed poorly constructed coffee grinder."
1,Almost a good grinder - if only the motor would last,"We liked the industrial design and general look and feel of this stainless steel and pastic grinder but found the performance and reliability to be lacking. The grind takes too long to become fine, leaving beans half or quarter cut and requiring multiple taps and pulsing to get a consistent result. The one design flaw that is unfortunate is that while this model comes with a handy little plastic lid to cover the stainless steel bowl if you have left over grind to save for the next day, you can not then return the grinding lid or cover to the device without having a gap. Almost a great design for a grinder.... but not quite. We returned the unit to the BBB store for full credit when the motor failed after about 4 months of use. From the start there was a motor burning smell that we were living with. We will be trying another brand."
2,Dissapointed,"Let me start by saying that the actual grinding works. I have only used it to grind noncoffee items, primarily flax seeds and rose hips. My complaints are that the lid is not dishwasher safe, the seal is not tight so I have to clean essentially the whole machine each time I use it and the grooves in the base make ground up food hard to get at, it doesn't grind evenly, and you have to keep your hand on it the whole time that it is working. It does a much more even job on the flax seeds than the rose hips. I am now seeking a replacement."
3,"Pretty, but not too functional","We registered for this (for our wedding) because it matched the Cuisinart coffee maker we liked. While the coffee maker is wonderful, this grinder has always been sub-par. It takes over 4 times as long to grind coffee with this one as it did with our 10-year old Braun."
1,"1, 2, 3 and it's fried!","Ground the first cup, no problem. Ground the second cup, no problem. Halfway through the third cup it started smoking and stopped.It looks good and it's well designed but it's still a piece of crap when the motor fries after the third use."
1,Stay away!,"Worked fine for a few months. Now, the bushing that holds the blade shaft is either worn out or gone."
1,disappointed,"I had this coffee grinder for at least 5 years before it died. Loved the style, how well it ground and especially how easily it emptied (cup removes from the grinder so there is no spillage). I bought one for my daughter 3 years ago and hers is still working perfectly. So, when I went to replace it, I naturally ordered the exact same grinder. Worked for 1 week and died, sent it back and got another, same thing. Finally, I went to a local store and bought one thinking Amazon must have a bad batch. Died again. So, I have given up. Whoever is making this grinder for Amazon in China is going to give this fine brand a bad name. If ever they figure it out I would buy this machine again in a minute!"
1,Pretty on the Outside Ugly on the Inside,"We bought the grinder without reading the reviews, it was a Cuisinart. Their matching coffee maker is a Consumer Reports Best Buy and highly rated at Amazon. However we are returning our second grinder in less than two months, and expect the latest replacement to also fail. We were annoyed that we spent the amount of money that we did on this grinder and then had to pay shipping to get the first replacement (Cuisinart is paying the shipping on the second replacement). Cuisinart Customer service has been courteous, however do yourself a favor and don't buy this grinder."
1,Piece of Junk,"Dont buy this grinder. Im returning my second one today. Like other reviewers, they both ran for awhile then just stopped. Its like the motor burns up or something."
1,Poor product,"3 months after I bought this grinder, I put the beans in and plugged it in. It turned on without me initiating the grinding, beans flew all over the kitchen. I bought it at a store 50 miles from my home, so decided to just live with the inconvenience and never forget to put the top on before plugging in the grinder. Ten months later, the grinder just stopped working altogether. The manufacturer stated the warranty was expired and so too bad. I bought the grinder because of the name, a brand which has a history, thinking this would equal quality. I would never buy one of their products again, based on the shoddy product, and the disregard for client service and satisfaction."
1,Horrible Grinder!,I love most of Cuisinart's small electrics but this one does not match up. I bought this to upgrade from my 9.99 braun and it was no upgrade at all. It does not grind the beans very well and takes forever to do it.It makes a big mess in the process. I wrote to Cuisinart regarding this product and they never replied. Not a good purchase.
1,"Nice looking, not very functional","Finally decided to replace my 10 year old cuisinart coffee grinder as it holds only about 3 cups of coffee beans at most to grind at one time. This unit holds quite a bit more and I can grind about 12oz of coffee beans in 5 cupfuls. Unfortunately, it takes almost as long to try and get it to grind. Some of it is very finely ground as other reviewers have noted, especially those that are stuck under the blades. The rest are larger pieces (and much larger compared to the old grinder) and some are beans that are barely touched. I can run the grinder for minutes at a time, on-off-on-off and still some beans never get fully ground. I wish I could recommend this to others, but I can not as it doesn't do the only thing I wish it would well - grind coffee."
1,Broke after a couple months of use,We used this coffee grinder 2 -3 times a week for about 2 months for grinding grains. The blade then fell apart -- apparently it melted. I would not recommend this product.
2,"it's a chopper, not a grinder...","As with all coffee 'grinders' that are actually using blades to spin around and chop the beans, you end up with very inconsistent 'grinds'. This unit is simple enough to clean, and does a fair job of insulating the motor heat from the beans, but it is still a chopping unit.This does as well a job of chopping beans as many less expensive models, so the the only plus features of this are the style and ease of cleaning, for that it is quite nice.If you are interested in a good consistent grind for your beans, a burr grinder is the only way to go."
1,Do not buy this product.,"The motor burned out within 9 months of light use. Additionally, it does not grind the beans evenly. All fashion, no function."
1,THE WORST PURCHASE I'VE EVER MADE,"I should have listened to the other reviews, so many of which said how quickly this alleged coffee grinder broke. I used mine ONCE, it worked fine, and when I then went to use it again for a second round of beans 10 minutes later, it died. Just flat out stopped working. I tried cleaning it, using different outlets on the walls, but trust me, it is dead. I own a Cuisinart food processor that is awesome, and that I'd highly recommend, but it's hard to believe that this poorly constructed piece of JUNK bears the same company name. Whatever you do, do not purchase this absolute piece of garbage."
1,Don't Buy,"I kept changing my mind whether to buy this or not because of all the reviews. But I liked the size and appearance, so I bought it for my husband as a Christmas gift. I think we used it 3 times before it completely stopped working. I was so disappointed and frustrated and will definitely rely more on customer reviews for my future buying decisions."
1,Electrical Failure after 5 weeks,"We brew 8-10 cups of coffee each morning. This grinder takes forever to grind and about 3 weeks into it we noticed a slight burning smell once but continued to use it with no other incidence until 2 weeks later, yesterday morning, when the grider started smoking out the back. I unplugged it and immediately took it back to the place of purchase for a full refund.Advice against purchasing."
1,Don't buy this grinder!,"We received this grinder 3 years ago as a wedding gift and it has broken 3 times. Luckily we just returned it to Bed Bath and Beyond and they replaced it for free each time. Today was the final straw, I went to grind my coffee this morning and the motor hummed but the blade didn't spin. Not only did this grinder not last, it did a awful job at grinding. The grounds would stick to the side of the bowl and would not give an even grind. I would STRONGLY suggest NOT buying this product."
1,Piece of garbage product from a piece of garbage company,"After only two months of use this coffee grinder began acting crazy. As soon as we plug it in it runs when it's supposed to let you press the cap to make it pulse. I called the cuisinart ""customer service"" line and they will replace it but there is a $10 charge PLUS you have to pay for your own shipping. How ridiculous is that? You are better off spending another $15 (which you will pay anyways between their ""charge"" and shipping costs) and buying a better product."
1,Won't grind evenly,"The output of this machine are a wide variety of sizes of grounds, including chunks the size of half a coffee bean. And that's even after 30 seconds of grinding aiming for a fine grind. That's really bad. The problem is the grind chamber is just too big, and the blades not in the right place. It sets up a pretty vortex of swirling coffee, but huge chunks simply evade the blades completely and end up wasted in your brewer. You can improve this by stopping and shaking every five seconds or so. That does improve things, get the big chunks to grind a bit better. This grinder also leaks the grounds out the bottom, since the blades are loosely set in the chamber. Too bad, 'cos it looks great!"
2,beware,I liked this grinder okay (did not grind fine enough for my tastes) but then smoke started to come out when it was on. Of course I did not think it was safe to use. Don't know if that is a common experience with this model but I'm not getting another one.
1,"3 down, no more to go.........","Instead of searching for reviews on Amazon like I should. I decided to just pick up this product by whim at my local electronics store.My first grinder had the blade melted and fused with the cup. Therefore blade does not spin. Maybe it was because I didn't fully dry the cup before I stored it away. I exchanged this since it was within the month I purchased it.Second grinder was no suprise at all! It eventually happened again! I began to wonder what the difference was. This time I kept the cup seperate with the grinder itself drip dry. But that didn't work at all!Third grinder was totally different from the other two. The cup was bigger.... Still looked the same and model was the same. But apparently it was the same way this machine broke. I gave up on trying to replace this and try for another, more cheaper grinder to waste my time on."
4,owned for 5 years - no issues,"I got this as a wedding gift in 2004 and have been using it daily to grind coffee ever since. I have had no issues, although I guess sometimes the grind isn't 100% even...but I hardly notice and my coffee is excellent - my friends and family rave about it."
1,Look Elsewhere for a Grinder,"As so many others have stated, this coffee grinder does not actually grind coffee. No matter how long we grind, we wind up with bits and chunks and even whole beans (such a frustrating waste of money there). And, like another poster, I believe that is because there is too much room between the blades and the bottom of the grinding cup.Design is also flawed in that if you put too many beans in the cup, the coffee will fly out all over as you grind so we have to actually grind 2 batches for our morning brew.Sorry Cuisinart, I love you generally, but this one is a dud and should be taken off the market. I would give it no stars if I could."
1,Don't bother!,"One day, my grinder overheated and stopped working. It happened just a month out of warranty and Cuisinart refused to replace it. My co-worker purchased this exact same coffee grinder and the same thing happened to hers, but just a month after buying it! Overheated and stopped working.While it was under $30, so not worth it!"
2,New Year's coffee emergency,Grinder worked well at first although ground less consistently than we would have liked; On New Years Eve (close to one year after purchase) it started to smoke and make a terrible noise. Bad timing! We must resort to mortar and pestle on New Year's Day. Lesson Learned: always have the replacement grinder on hand for the inevitable grinder demise.
1,Worked OK while it lasted,"This thing somehow managed to weld itself together. The thing overheated and the plastic rotating stem welded to the plastic base of the grinding cup. Not a good mechanical design. I managed to free it but will soon have to replace, only used sparingly.Also agree that some beans were turned to dust while others grind coarse. I would NOT recommend this thing at all."
2,Stick with plastic,"These look fantastic -- when they're new. When you clean them, however, the leaves fray pretty badly at the edges. They also attract algae much more than my plastic plants for some reason...and once the algae gets on the leaves, you can't clean it completely off."
4,Happy to find this hard to find item.,"Two hole gauge panel, chrome. Driver quality chrome, not show quality, but looks good with my Auto Meter gauges. I had a hard time finding one of these, usually the 2 hole panels are black. It arrived promptly and mounted no problem. If you need a 2 hole chrome gauge panel, this is a good one for the money, not to mention I couldn't find it anywhere else in stock."
4,Best book that i've had to read in college,"I thought that this book was amazing. I'm getting a double major in public relations and communication management with a minor in english. My freshman year second semester this was a book that we were assigned to read for an english class. I think that it's very interesting and i would suggest that anybody that is looking for a good read should pick this up! My only wish is that the author would release it for the kindle, and the bell jar!"
2,UPDATE: Tim Hennis,"""A Knock on the Door: Timothy Hennis"" (p. 92)In 2006, a DNA test linked Hennis to semen collected from Kathryn Eastburn's body. Hennis was tried in military court and found guilty in 2010. Hennis continues to appeal, based on the right of the military court to try him."
4,Haven't used it yet,"The only thing I can really comment on at the moment is the fact that it arrived in a timely manner. This filter is hard to find, so a few of them were purchased for future purposed, and it has not been used as of yet (and won't be for a little while)."
4,Good Light Read,"This is a good light read that I read on vacation in about a day and a half. If you want something rich and edifying, look elsewhere. But if you want a fun romp, this series is it. This is the fourth adventure and I just bought number 5. I thought the characters were very interesting, and the south of France an interesting change of scenery. Faith gets herself into more jams than anyone I've ever known, but it's half the fun it. Relax and enjoy!"
3,Disappointing,"I find the characters of Faith and her husband Tom Fairchild to be very enjoyable. They are not what you would think of as the typical minister and his wife. However, I did not think this particular mystery was as good a work as the others in the series. I kept getting certain characters in the book confused and most of the ""suspects"" were forgetable. I also thought the plot was a bit vague or complicated.If you haven't read any of the Faith Fairchild books I would say start with a different one than the Body in the Vestibule but if you are a die hard fan, than the book is probably worth reading just for the delight of spending some time with the Fairchilds."
5,MUST HAVE DANCE ALBUM,"This is the original and stereotypical eurodance album (vintage1997). I have two copies -one for car - one for house-- High energy,upbeat --every track is good with poss exception of #5 Sentimental. Bailando and both remixes are much better than the easier to get Loona version but definitely worth the trouble. I especially like the balad Never Again. ..."
2,"Too Generic, Riddled with Mistakes","I went to school there and decided to take a peek at the book. They refer to the school as UTA at one point, which is the Arlington campus not the Austin campus. Sounded as if they used a lot of material from the internet and did not list any of the social intricacies I would have expected. Namely the lowdown on student orgs and such.I'll just say that the experience you have at any school is far too dynamic to be defined or captured by a book. Especially a book that was written by outsiders. If you want the real lowdown, ask the orientation advisors when you get there."
4,Grew up with this music,"No Garfunkel here, but still great music. xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxx xxx xxxx xx xxx xx x"
3,How many must he put out?,"Look, I consider Paul Simon as nothing short of genius and I own everything that is available from his collection so forgive me if I'm a bit cynical about yet another ""greatest hits"" album. Paul has churned them out like crazy but what annoys me about this collection is there is NOTHING new. You can buy all of this material on subsequent albums. He doesn't have a live track or an alternative version. This is Paul cranking it out because he's Paul Simon. About the only audience for this is for those who want an introduction to Paul without the investment. It's a great starter album and there is a huge amount of material that he includes including not so famous number one hits. However, that's the only reason to consider this rerun."
4,Paul Simon Redux,This is Paul simon cut right to the bone with no filler whatsoever! I enjoy everything on this collection and The Capeman stuff is good to finally have on cd! I compare this to the Traveling Wilbury's Collection that was recently released also w/ a DVD!! It's all very familiar but worth revisiting over and over again!
3,Where Is St. Judy's Comet?? - Needs More Early Solo Tunes,"Not a bad collection (although it would be almost impossible to make a bad Paul Simon collection!) - but where is St Judy's Comet and Rene And Georgette Magritte With Their Dog After The War - two of his best songs!! Should have much more of his early solo stuff and much less of his later stuff (which is not nearly as good)! Like many artists, they seem to want to have more later stuff on best of/essential/anthology collections even when the later stuff is not as good as the early stuff -- guess they hate to admit they are in decline!"
5,Still Great After All These Years,"If you like Paul Simon, you'll LOVE this CD. This collection of songs reminds us all of Paul Simon's musical genius. I just keep listening to the CD over and over again. Hope he decides to tour again soon."
2,"2 broken tips out of 6, and not that sharp","I have had these for a few years. After the first year one of the tips broke off. A couple of years later another tip broke off, this time cutting an apple.I don't have the warranty to know where to return these to, so I am stuck with them, but seriously I just want some better knives rather than paying to ship the bad ones somewhere and wait for a possible refund.Even through I prefer Wustof to Henkels on the high end stuff, we have a cheap set of Henkels stamped steak knives that seem more sturdy and cut better than these."
2,The quality is lacking.,"These are not what you'd expect from Wusthof. The Wusthof symbol on the handle is a STICKER (!!!) which bleaches out after washing. Also, after 1 months use and washing, we're getting rust spots. While these knives are sharp, they are not holding up appearance wise. Very disappointed."
1,Flimsy,"These are quite flimsy and develop rust spots extremely easily. Not the quality one would expect from this company. We have several of Wusthof Classic's line (Chef's, paring, utility, etc) have found them to be sturdy, true, well-balanced in the hand and have held up very well over the past 3 years in our busy kitchen. We didn't expect these steak knives to be of the same quality, but they were suprisingly low quality for the brand and the cost."
2,Too light,Knives are too light for me. They are sharp and beautiful... But they are too light for my taste feels cheap
1,avant-garbage,If you like listening to a soprano yelp like a dog while some guy saws on a violin then this is for you. Otherwise pass.
5,101 Inspirational Stories of the Priesthood,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! It was easy to read and hard to put down. This book also gave me good insight and helped me to feel that our Priests really do still have some time to give of themselves with even little ole' me, if I but only have the courage and inspiration to call upon them in my need. There were a few stories which touched me more deeply than the others. I think it will be the same for anyone who reads it since it speaks to so many of our human experiences. Thank you to Sr. Patricia for all her work on this pleasant and inspiring read."
2,Made for TV movie that excludes a lot of information from th,As a survivor of this event I found that there where a number of errors made and that the story line was the point of view of only a couple of people as far as events at the site where concerned. Production on this film was already under way when I was asked for my input. However it makes for good entertainment and gives a fair accounting of the hardships encountered by the survivors.
4,Great movie,"In the dead of winter, a C-130 military transport flying from Thule, Greenland to Alert, Canada crashes on an ice cap about 2 miles from Alert. Unfortunately, an arctic storm hampers rescue attempts, and a long, cold ordeal sets in. I, personally, thought this was an excellent movie"
4,Not bad for a made for TV movie,"I was stationed at RCAF Alert several decades before this event but knew some of the crew. Alert is the most northern occupied settlement in the world and is used nowdays to listen in on Russian submarine movements. They shot the film near Edmonton AB, which is about 3,000 miles south of Alert and with a completely different terrain. Having said that, they did a pretty good job of showing just how harsh conditions can be. My understanding is that the Chamberlain character was somewhat overdone as far as the guilt thing, but overall it's worth the watch."
5,Ballykissangel,"The Ballykissangel series are clean, wholesome material that provides great entertainment. We look forward to owning more of the DVD's"
4,Perfect for protecting your GBA.,"Alright, as the other review states, this case ONLY fits a GBA and that's it. Nothing else. Well, okay, if you have a game in the machine, then it can store 1 game. Still, it's small. However, it's strong and you DON'T have to worry about scratching the screen. This case it the best protection for the GBA.Now, here's a tip. No matter what other case you buy, there's a possibility of scratching the GBA screen. Well, my solution was this: I used this case to protect my GBA. Then, I bought a Mad Catz carry case and put my GBA (in the Gamester case) right into the Mad Catz carry case. It fits perfectly. And, there you go. You now can carry your GBA along with accessories and games WITHOUT scratching the screen! ^_~"
4,Boston Red Sox Purse,It is a really cute purse for the real Boston Red Sox fans! I gave it as a gift and she absolutely loved it.
2,No,Kinda sexy but mostly uncomfortable. I've found that if I wear it for more then a couple of hours the under wires start to hurt.
1,Apalling picture quality,"This device seems to work OK as a web camera, but if you're looking to use it as a digital camera, forget it. The picture quality was unbelievably bad..."
1,A fool and his money are soon parted.,"There is absolutely nothing in this product that is worth talking about. It is designed to make a fool part with his money. The quality of the pictures is very poor. Even the video conferencing wasn't smooth. This means the two uses of this product are not worth the money. The device drivers do have a bug that cause the system to hang when this application is on. I got my wisdom back after I returned this ""digital camera""."
1,It gave me a hard time!,"Just receiving 2days ago, I spent a whole day to plug it in and out :(. First, I followed the instruction very carefully (I know it is very important 'cause I heard many complaints about installing a WEB CAM).After it said install successful, pressed Finish and restarted , my computer was halted. Plugged it out, restarted by pressing the power button, plugged it in again, thank God, it worked. However, my happiness stopped 30 SECOND later.""Camera was unplugged ..."" even though it was plugged. I had to plug out , restart and plug in again, the same thing happened, it freezed my computer after only 1 minute with a terrible quality of video. Checked it with another computer, the same thing happened. Returned it back and I gonna get another name."
3,Innovative but bad quality of pic,"When I first saw this product in the market, I think this is one of the most innovative product (as it is not only a webcam, it can also be detached and take pictures as a digital camera). We tested it for over a week now and found out that one of the pitfalls (major weakness) of this camera is the bad quality of pictures. The manual focus at the front of the camera even worsen the case as photographer has no idea how good the ""focus"" is doing. i.e. you don't really know the quality of the pictures after it was being transferred back to the computer. I heard that Webcam Go Plus solved this problem a bit but not really sure until we test it. To conclude, don't expect too much from it, I'll position it as a very bad quality but cheap digital camera as for the price it is asking for, you really can't get any digital camera in the current market."
2,"Bad stills, poor quality software","A similar experience to most here in the UK. Many hours wasted getting some degree of quality from the webcam feature, involved long long downloads from the creative support web-site (although this was easy to locate and use). Having updated everything, I still encounter problems with the ""go plus"" software which crashes if trying to delete pictures from the album. I agree with others: forget the ""go"" feature, unless you are going to use this in glorious sunshine, very close up. Anything else and you will get very poor colour, blurred images etc. Not being able to preview your photo before logging back on to the PC makes this a real problem. The above was experienced on a bang upto date Dell XPS B800R, 128 Mb memory and Windows ME."
3,"Nice as webcam but not for ""GO""","If you are planning to buy this cam just because it is ""Go"", i advise you don't... Just ignore that feature.. Picture quality is very bad while capturing stills on the ""go"" and images get distorted(lines and dots) by electronic devices nearby..This webcam can capture smooth AVI files up to 320 x 240, 24 Bits, ~20.000 Frames/Sec with Indeo Video 5 on my P-II 350Mhz system (UDMA33 HDs). 640x480 mode is good for 24bit still captures or AVI files below ~10 Frames/Sec.I expected to capture stills on the go with this cam so i rate it; 3 stars for AVI capture and web use, 0 stars for mobile use.. that's 3 out of 5 stars..."
1,Spend your money on another product.,"This is one of the worst computer products I have ever purchased. Forget that the picture quality is just unbelievably bad, as a web cam and as a still cam. The product caused my Gateway 2500 notepad to continuously crash. It was so bad I had to reformat my hard drive. So unless you want to spend hours on the phone with tech support fixing your computer, buy some other product. This one is garbage."
3,Low-Quality Design & Results,"This product is tiny, easy to use, and stores a lot of images. However, the picture quality is hardly able and the software included with the camera tends to crash a lot.In other words, this product may be a new toy but it is hardly a quality camera."
4,Fun and interesting,"This little book from Dover Publications contains a number of dinosaurs and other prehistoric reptiles, realistically depicted. The poses are lively, and the designs themselves are colorful. My favorite is the sleek blue plesiosaurus, though the sturdy brachiosaurus is a very close second. The eight other tattoos show a swimming metriorhynchus, a flying dimorphodon, a stegosaurus, a compsognathus, a dilophosaurus, an allosaurus, a lesothasaurus, and a camptosaurus. They make a neat gift for a budding paleontologist, although expect to listen to everything your young friend knows about these, and other, dinosaurs."
2,bad tattoos,These are bad tattoos. My daughter loves dinosaurs and when I put these on her they only last about an hour until they look like crap. They are not waterproof and they don't last. I put a tattoo from a movie promo item and it lasted for about a week. These just don't stand up to anything.
2,What is the point?,"What is the point? This has all been done already - and far better.Even if drummer Gregg Bendian could come close to Billy Cobham's incredible genius (one the greatest artists ever on the drums), the rest of the band falls far short. There is no valid artistic reason to copy art. The Mahavishnu masterpieces should be left alone.The only good thing I can say about this project is that it increases the chances that the younger crowd can find and appreciate the original recordings."
3,NuTone Rnage hood filters,"The replacement filters are fine. They a little flimsier than the orignal filters I had but seem to do the job.The mailing of the filters took a little longer than I expected but did arrive within 10 business days. At over $12, the shipping and handling was more that the cost of a filter.All that being said, this is one of the few places that actually stocks the filters and they provide good service and excellent updates as to the status of the order."
5,"Fit, and came quick!","This filter fit and came quickly. My hood is old and the fan does not work that well, but this was part of my spring cleaning project and I was glad it was so easy to find and check off my list! Thanks!"
3,Not as pictured,This photo is misleading. I bought this item because this picture and description are spot on for the original filter that came with my range hood. The product I received is not the same one that is pictured and described. There are no blue/yellow color stripes that will signal time for replacement as described in the text. The filter material bows outward badly on one side. The foam filter material itself is not as dense as the original filters for my hood -- you can see daylight easily through the mesh. My old filter's mesh material was quite dense. The metal frame is the same size so it can be used in the filter rack on my hood but it is flimsy and not the same quality. I bought two based on the picture match and now wish I had only purchased one since it's not the same product. Arrived quickly though.
2,Cheap Material,"The aluminum ends are really weak! I was trying to install it the Range Hood as stated in the directions but the aluminum corners bent and cracked from the ends.The quality was cheap, but I guess it solves the purpose."
1,Cheaply made,The filter fits but the border is crimped very poorly as to where I had trouble gettting it to fit and stay in. Poor manufacturing.
4,Not as good as ones from a few years ago. But..........,"Some of the other reviews complained about the filter being flimsy and not domed or having the color stripes. The one I received does not look exactly like the originals from a few years ago and the metal frame does seem lighter weight. However, it does have the ""dome"" in the middle and does have some colored markings though not as clear as the old ones. I think it will work fine. Good price and once it's in place, it doesn't need to be durable. It last until it lasts. Frankly, nothing these days is as well made as it used to be. Cheap materials and no pride of workmanship is the normal these days. :("
2,Flimsy and doesn't fit right,"This is definitely not OEM Nutone quality. The filter is very flimsy, arrived bent and doesn't have the color change indicator for when it's time to replace it. Further, the filter was flat instead of domed in the middle. The dome is needed to accommodate the fan blades. After modifying it we are able to use it, but I won't be buying this item again when I can get the superior OEM filter for the same or less money."
5,Just what I needed,This was exactly as described on Amazon. It was the correct manufacturer and size at a good price. Works great!
5,OEM Perfect Fit,"I tried to replace the overhead Vent Hood Range Fan Filter with a Lowe's and Home Depot and awful quality. Grateful to have bought 2 of these OEM Filter replacements. Quality, Fit, Performance....Perfect."
2,Pretty cheesy and way too much over acting,"I think it has become a tradition of Shahrukh Khan to over act and made movies extremely cheesy. It's almost like you're watching a bad soap opera sometimes. He's a funny guy, but he's terrible at drama. And 90% of this movie is just plain drama. The whole India-Pakistan theme is good since it fosters some kind of understanding between the two groups, but otherwise the movie was not very good.Better to watch the Discovery channel than waste a night watching this! Seriously!"
2,Issue of Quality,"This is a great movie! You will very much enjoy the story line. The audio/video quality was terrible. The subtitles were so far behind the movie that you found yourself frantically wanting to know what was being said or what what going on in the movie since you saw it long before the words showed up.I don't know if it was specifically the copy I purchased. My recommendation for any foreign film is to purchase a ""new"" copy."
3,"Sorry everyone, would love to love this, but....","just cannot get past the over-acting, the screaming sentimentality and over the top, in your face sucrose laden characters. Of course, the story in general is lovely, anyone with a heart would like it, the premise, the story line etc even if you must suspend your rationale at the click of PLAY. Beautiful scenery, beautiful actors, and I will grant you I have never seen a Bollywood movie in my life which, unfortunately, made the sudden and seemingly never ending breaks into song and dance somewhat jarring to say the least. If that is the way it is, then that is the way it is - am just not familiar with it and dont much care for it.If you like Bollywood movies (or the type), beautiful people and beautiful scenery and can suspend your credulity, you will undoubtedly love this movie. I wish I had."
5,"A superb modern classic, excellently transferred",It is like night and day the difference between the clarity of the Blu-ray when compared to the DVD release. Totally pleased I bought this superb upgrade of my favorite Bollywood movie.
4,A surprisingly good movie!,"I sat down to watch this film with rather low expectations. I mean, sure, it was backed up by heavy star power, like the unfailing Shahrukh Khan, and the excellent Amitabh Bachan, but I didn't expect the film itself to be good. However, this was a beautiful masterpiece, and I must say Yash Chopra has pulled off another splendid film! My only two complaints were that the film tended to drag at some parts, and there was one song (but only one) that bored me a little. Overall, it is a nice film, and should be watched if you have the patience and time. The plot was good, and the romance was not overdone (like in many Hindi films). The main theme song is also rather catchy, and you'll find yourself humming it after you've watched the movie. There is no violence in this film, and it's good for the whole family (I mean that)!"
5,A Bollywood Must-Have,"This beautiful and tragic tale is a Bollywood masterpiece. SRK and Preity Zinta make a fantastic couple and deliver stellar performances. The supporting cast is right up there with them, and the music and dance scenes are some of the most memorable that Bollywood has to offer. One thing I love about this film is its communication of good values. The good characters have virtues that set them apart from the villains and give you a lot to think about. And of course, I love the poem read near the end of the movie. A great movie to show Bollywood newcomers to get them hooked hook, line, and sinker!"
2,Sony LCS-THE/B Soft Carrying Case for DSCT7 Digital Camera,This case is not soft at all. The quality of leather is not that good either. If I had seen this case before I purchased I would not buy it.
3,Dissapointed (no belt clip),"The case is very nice, unfortunately it was until I received it that I realized that it has no belt clip, it is just a case that will protect your camera if you want to have it inside a purse.Too big for a pocket.The quality is good but I gave it only 3 stars because of that."
5,A MUST HAVE TO PROTECT YOUR INVESTMENT,"I recently went on spring break to Daytona, FL and took my Sony T7 camera along. I had bought this case almost a year ago and even bought one for my sister who has the same exact camera; this is how impressed I was with this case. While in Daytona I took a lot of pictures and put the camera back in it's case at all times to protect it. I even made the mistake of putting the camera in my back pocket and sitting on it while it was in it's case and NOTHING HAPPENED!!!Overall Advice To Potential Buyers: Buy this case. It is well worth the investment. If you don't, you may end up with a cracked, scratched, or damaged screen. Thank me later."
4,Nice looking leather,"Soft leather carrying case gives a very keen look to the camera. However, taking the camera in and out of the case can accidentally turn the camera on and off. Overall it's a nice looking leather case. Like it!!!"
4,Good compact case for your camera,"This is a good case to protect the camera. It does increase the overall size (of the camera) making it little difficult for it to fit in your pant pocket, but I would still recommend this when protection is the primary objective. I felt the leather was little on the stiffer side."
1,Made in China - no replacement parts!!!!,"We purchased this as a gift for our children last Christmas & were having a great time playing with it. However, within 3 months the scoring device broke. It is made of very cheap plastic. We tried to replace the part through Carrom's customer service & were told there were no replacement parts available, as this model is made in China. We were told that the basketball system is their ""problem child"", and our only option is to buy another one. Why would I throw away more money?!?!? I would expect something at this price point to be sturdier and last longer than 3 months. We are all very disappointed, as this was really fun while it lasted.I own an air hockey table by Carrom that was made in the U.S. & have had no problems with it. As a result of this experience, I will not purchase anything from them again regardless of where it was made. This is a really poor way of treating your cutomers, Carrom. You should be ashamed of yourself!"
2,Toys of Disappointment,"Had the unit for about 2 months when the scoring unit failed. Overall, the game isn't bad, definitely home owner grade, but a bit pricey for what you get. Setting it against a wall helps the tippiness and makes the thing more sturdy. But the scoring unit failed and there are no replacements. My son still uses it, but head to head competition is gone. If you are considering this, I would find something else. While it may not be Carrom's fault they can not get replacement parts from their Chinese supplier, it is their fault for choosing to continue to work with that supplier. At roughly $300, this unit is another big Chinese disappointment. If I had known replacement parts were not available, I never would have purchased. I guess that is what we get in our throw away society."
5,best ever,It is great to play with and I think every body should get one. IT is a great gift . I got this for my son and he loves it.
3,It's ok.,"It's a decent sized bar that will last a long time. It has good lather and no residue. The scent is great. However, it's much stronger in the box than when using. I could barely smell it when showering. Other than that, I had no problems with it, but I porbably won't buy it again because of the weak smell when using it."
1,Poor Communication and Follow-through,"No positives can be said as I've never received the product, which I ordered over 6 weeks ago."
5,Amazingly true to life,"After several trips to the Vale of Avoca, it's easy to see how one could easily fall into line with the characters of Ballykissangel. From wily Brian Quiqley to quizzical Father Clifford and the highly changeable Niamh. The series truly portrays the idyllic countryside and the lifestyle that is so relaxed. Those who love Ireland and the Irish people will love Ballykissangel as they see the small town through the eyes of the local citizenry. Driving through the countryside, you can see images of Donal and Liam at almost every turn in the road, hoping they are not carring an electronic confessional!For those who have been waiting, Series 3 will be available in March 2005, so enjoy Series 1 and 2 and be ready for more Irish laughter and fun in the new year. We'll be in Ireland when it makes it debut and we'll hoist a pint in Fitzgerald's in celebration!"
2,Its no love story,"Its an alright series, but it certainly isnt a love story, and I am a little disapointed in the drama. I had thought it would be more like the Monarch of the Glenn. Its not."
4,"Good, but...","The first season was light-hearted. We love the characters and the scenery, but in the next two seasons it lost it's light-heartedness! Still a good watch!"
1,Too confusing..,"This book was confusing...it was required of me to purchase by my professor, but everything I learned I taught myself from a different book...This was simply poorly written...sorry..."
2,Argh! Frustrating book,"This book does some concepts well, but many sections are less than a 5th of a page long before giving you one or two examples and inundating you with exercises. Without a professor doing most of the teaching, you will not learn multivariable calculus from this book."
1,This is not a good book!,"I have read several books on St. Francis. This is by far the worst--in fact it is one of the poorest written books that I have ever read! The subject matter is only remotely connected to St. Francis, is very much out of date and is highly biased. I just do not recommend it at all. I gave it one star only because that was the lowest possibility...I don't think that it even rates that much."
1,Pure Torture,"Having been forced to read this book as part of my MA course in Research Methods I was determined to make the best of it. Unfortunately after 2 hours of trying again and again to make sense of each paragraph (and I'm not normally stupid) I had to give up.A little sample ""The requirement of qualitativeness must be dropped. Yet many true generalisations restricted to particular times, places or things do seem incapable of supporting explanations. That every coin in my pocket is made of copper does not explain whey the dirty coin in my pocket is made of copper"" p55 - What?Unfortunately it gets worse and he spends another 5 pages going on about the dirty copper/ not copper coin.It's not to say that you shouldn't attempt to read the book, but if you suceed in understanding it I truly do salute you.Annabella"
2,Innova Senior Adult Dog Food Suspect,"Our Beagle recently had spell of odd behavior. He was shaking and hiding in closets. He ran away from us when we tried to call him. We put him on an alternate diet of rice and a little chicken and over three or four days he slowly got better. Because we were unsure of the cause, we stopped his Innova Senior Adult food and shopped for a premium substitute. He eventually rebounded to his old self. A day ago my wife decided to see if he was ok on the Innova Senior and began mixing it with the new food. Tonight we had a repeat of the symptoms which scared us to death. He was having trouble walking and was shaking and was acting some what like before. We are now very unsure of the Innova and will make inquiries for how to have it tested. Until we know more, we will not be feeding him any more Innova."
5,Great and I mean Great dog food,Both of our Bouviers eat Innova Dog Food. One which is 10 yrs old eats the senior food and our younger one which is 2 yrs old is now eating Innova low cal dog food. The only problem I see with buying it from Amazon is that there is no price break. I pay the same for it at the local kennel with no shipping charges. I still think this food is the best food I can feed our beautful Bouviers. I believe our 10 yr. old is still going strong because of this food. She has eaten for the last 5 years.
5,Finally Found It!,"I switched to Innova Senior from Natural Balance after the recent pet food recall. Within a week after switching and for the 1st time in 9 years, my dog has healthy stools! I am speechless that a dog food could make such a big difference. Over the years, we had tried numerous foods, dietary supplements, and prescription medications - all to negligible or short-lived effect. Our vet finally prounounced that he was just ""one of those dogs"" who had chronic digestive difficulties. I had heard from many how great this food was, but never expected it to be able to clear up such a long-standing problem. Highly recommend."
5,Excellent,"These are excellent for use in cosplay, which is the reason why I purchased them. I have not tried them out over long distances, but in my experience so far they are very sturdy, well made, and easy to walk on. The wood seems light and probably will not stand up to heavy use (particularly over concrete, etc.), but for costume and photoshoot purposes they work quite well and I had no problems with them at all. For $20, this is a very good deal."
5,A wonderful introduction to Finnish music,"Finland, besides Sibelius, would not be known in the world for music. But Merikanto's entrancing music, string-heavy and rich with texture, is an excellent backdrop to the opera's libretto. Speaking from a passionate connection with the language, Finnish is not the most beautiful to listen to. However, it adds to the quality. Listen to a couple pieces of the opera if you're not sure."
4,REALISTIC ADAPTATION OF AFRO-AMERICAN CULTUREtHE,"The Piano Lesson was viewed by our adult education class for the interpersonal communication methods we were studying about. We were to watch for the colors used in the movie, the relationships between the players, any culture traits, superstitions, etc. The class will be writing papers this week on the value of the movie. I enjoyed the jargon and dialogue between the men and Boerniece. The piano represented more than a musical instrument. Boy Willie came around to appreciating the heritage of the carvings on the piano. Whining Boy was the ""black sheep"" of the family, as most of us all have one."
2,For beginners I guess,"I don't care for the type of drawings in this book. They do not have good quality in them. They are sketchy, and very basic. I believe, that whatever you are learning, be it in paint, pastel or pencil, the examples better be what you would like to achieve. I don't want my drawings to look like the ones in the book, they are a bad example of what I would like to accomplish.I don't feel I learned anything from this. I can't draw from circles and shapes. I need the real thing, with light and shadow. If you want to learn to draw people, start with yourself in the mirror or better yet, have a friend pose for you if he or shee can. Drawing from life is the best way to learn. But, if you need a book, get an artist's anatomy book. The stuff in this book is common sense anyway. I am not patient to start off so basic. I like to just dive in and see what happens and learn from there. I hope this book will help others who don't know how to draw."
3,It is intended as an indoor cover.,"I have had one of their products before,it was an all weather cover that worked very well for many years. This one that I bought is for indoor use to keep the garage dust and dirt off. It is al little thin and it looks like it may tear if it is pulled over something sharp. It looks good and fits very well for a ready fit. It is also easy to put on and take off. I gave 3 stars, only because I haven't had it long enough, time will tell. To help you judge if it will fit your car, this is on a 83 Datsun 280zx and fits very well, over hangs the front and rear bumpers and on the side comes down to the rocker panels."
1,Poor quality,Two - things1) Fit was not good. Almost too small and I did use the 'Make sure it fits' tool.2) Quality really bad - my finger actually ripped the material when pulling it over the car for the first time.
4,Very basic introduction,"This is a very, very basic introduction to the kind of psychology associated with James Hillman. The information is presented in short chapters (usually around 3-5 pages) and reads like a long Encylopedia entry (which is the form in which it was originally published). If you're a scholar looking for easily quotable summaries or a bibliography (more than half this book is bibliographic information), this volume would be useful. If you're looking to learn something or are after the pleasure Hillman's lyrical prose usually offers, you'll likely be disappointed here."
2,what is this ?,"Simply put, La Fruta Bomba is a scattershot live compilation of material from all different periods in Eddie Palmieri's career. No personnel are credited and the original source material is not identified. In addition, the sound quality is rather dismal. Given its rather dubious nature and presentation, one would be best served to try Fania's 2008 double-disc anthology -- sold for about the same price -- entitled The Sun of Latin Music."
5,Funny Every Time!,"I have seen productions of this play several times and each time it's hilarious! Now reading it I realize what geniuses the Reduced Shakespeare Company are - especially the writers Jess Borgenson, Daniel Singer and Adam Long! The book is worth it's price just for the footnotes. Their clever, witty, and yes - bawdy (Shakespeare would have been proud!) humor is priceless!"
5,Hilarious,The complete books is hilarious it is the funniest book that i have ever read!! i read it in a silent library and was cracking up making it very unsilent i was asked to leave!!!!!! This book makes shakespeare more enjoyable than ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:D
5,This book was too funny!,This was beyond hysterical. I have to stage manage a production of it and I don't know how I will concentrate on my work when all I can do it laugh! It's definitely a great read!
1,Pretty Basic Stuff,Only someone who has never lived before would find this book at all helpful. It defines concepts that I found were too basic to be of any real help. It also mixes different types of management styles and yet doesn't delve into their differences. Most of the other concepts were worthy of a 200 level university course. I would say skip it.
3,Not a bad book,"I found a lot of the information regarding supervision and such to be ""common sense"", stuff that anyone who has worked for a mid to large company already would know"
3,"Common sense info, unless you've never held a job","I had to buy this book for a mandatory class. I didn't learn anything I didn't already know from my own work experience, except for some technical jargon. It's an easy read, just dry."
2,wrong item,The book was in good condition but not the right book. I ordered the eightth version and recieved the fifth version. Thankfully I can still use the book for my class.
3,Beginners Place to Start,"Clear and concise. Basic information, however, which makes this book a good place to start for beginners breaking into the SEO arena."
1,Save your bucks programmer.,"I am a web developer who lately read a lot of SEO books and SEO online forums to bring my company website to the next lever, I came across this book, bought it, read it, and feel very disappointed with it.If you are designer, developer, programmer, or somehow HTML literate, and wanting to do more for your website, save your bucks on this book. This book is not designed for programmers. If you a business man whom just want to learn what SEO is, save your bucks too! You better of getting the knowledge from the dummies series. Although the book covers every aspect of SEO, but the book only describe very briefly on each aspect.Over 75% of the content in this book is general concepts of SEO, which you can basically learn from any other SEO books. The remaining 25% is the ""SEO Plan"", which I found not practical."
2,For beginners with spare time,"The writers have spent hours and months writting this book and it is hard not to admire their determination, but the result is unbalanced. The book does bring some hard facts and useful behaviours but enough to make a brochure not a full book. The first half of the book talks generalities and concepts about the web, about marketing and search engine behaviour but every time it is becoming really interesting the writers say ""we'll see that point in chapter XX"". It is a good trick to keep readers of thrillers on the edge, but I found it annoying and time wasting. Eventually the book gets into stats and practical actions but it feels too little too late. Most of the ""do to"" lists at the end of each chapter are more summaries than action points. If you are starting from scratch and have time, this book will teach you usefull things and fill your time."
5,Great book to establish your SEO plan,"I own and operate a small tourism based business. I found this book to offer a great, but simple to-do-list of what needs to be acomplished in order to succesfully market my site on the web. Thanks!"
1,returned it in one hour,"Got this book on monday, returned it on tuesday. An hour a day is the perfect title. After an hour I completly lost interest, starting skimming through the pages and found nothing useful. You can attend a 30 minute seminar and learn more about SEO."
2,So Much of Basics...,I must appreciate the effort taken by the Cousins but its sounds too basics.It could have had a faster pace and covered more SEO parameters.
2,Only for newbees in search marketing,"I hoped this book would tell me new things about search marketing. Unfortunately it did ot offer any new information for me. In my opinion the book has a too high housewife content. If you are a newbee and like to take it slowm this book is good for you. If you are somewhat experienced, look further."
1,Broke quickly,"I ordered this because I really wanted a litter scoop with a stand, but the scoop broke after just a few uses. Not worth the money. Now I'm back to using a sturdy scoop stored in a plastic bag."
1,Too Flimsy To Be Of Use,"The scoop looked like a good deal but that turned out to be wrong. The scoop and stand arrived with a thick coating of dust, I guess they aren't flying off of the shelves. The handle broke the very first time I used it. Don't waste your money, try and find something a little more substantial."
3,only ok,"Great idea! This scooper is way to small for 3 cats tho. I shoulda known better, 6 inches not so big."
2,Underwhelmed,"I am sorry to say I returned the Cuisinart Limited Edition Food Processor. I used a Braun Kitchen Center for many years, until I dropped the base and smashed it, and was disappointed that it worked better than this state of the art food processor.My main complaint was the chopping size inconsistencies. No matter how small and uniformly I cut something up it always had big pieces left. I love the features but can not deal with that. It defeats the purpose entirely to have to pre-chop everything so small and still get uneven results.I was also unhappy with the fact that they didn't provide storage for the attachments and discs. That is crazy for this price.I just spent much less on the highly rated KitchenAid KFP750OB 700-Watt 12-Cup Food Processor that does include a storage case for the attachments.Wish me better luck this time."
1,Work Bowl lid sticks & non-responsive customer service,"This product is awful and virtually unusable since we can't open the workbowl lid. When I use it, I have to call my husband to open it, and then even he struggles. This must be a major ongoing issue with all units, because the store demo was the same... but we just thought we didn't know how to open it, and didn't want to force it. I have emailed customer service twice, no response. I purchased my first Cuisinart in 1980, and it was wonderful. So this is particularly disappointing."
4,"Helpful book, could stand an update","Reptiles of the Solomon Islands isn't bad for a small regional guide. It's compact, has keys and multiple angles and photos of each species. No range maps, but a map of the islands and a list of islands you can find each species on is included. The layout is a little strange - it's tough to flip back and forth between pictures and descriptions and not get cross-eyed. Definitely a must for anyone interested in reptiles and traveling to the area, or anyone building a herp library."
5,Zoo Med Reptile Shed Aid,"I have a young Ball Python that I purchased in November. When I first brought him home, he had some difficulties shedding. They tend not to like change very much and the stress had him shedding very uneven. He wasn't shedding his head or eyes at all. With Reptile Shed Aid, we could literally spray it right on the eyes, and he didn't seem to mind it at all. He was able to shed both eyes and head on his own. We also rubbed some on his body, and with a little massaging (although just spraying would have been sufficient), we had his entire body shed in 15 minutes. He seemed to enjoy the conditioning effects as well as having the dry skin removed. We have been using this product ever since and are very pleased with the results. A little goes a long way, so you get your money's worth. It's watery, not greasy, and it's easy to use. Would highly recommend this product for your pet's comfort."
2,hasnt helped,Better off keeping the humidity level up and letting the snake shed naturally. Also keep something abrassive that the snake can rub up against in your tank setup.
3,Worth seeking out,"It's jazz-rock, I suppose, definitely not smooth and not quite like anything else in my collection, yet it contains echoes of various other albums I've heard over the years. Bass, drums, keyboards and guitar ~ a fairly standard line up with no vocals, it's got plenty of fresh power and pace with more than a hint of out and out rock flavour. The guitar's a tad shrill in places and the mix is a bit bright but, overall, this has much to commend it. Just one track, the oddly titled Mank de' Spunky, is decidedly unmelodic and has to be dropped.Given that so much other jazz being released these days is largely unoriginal and not much more than a rehash of all sorts of other stuff we've all heard a dozen times before, Faldo's Toy (Icon is merely the name of their debut album) represents a refreshing step forward into new territory. Check out this and everything else at their website."
2,looks nice on counter,I never return purchased items but this was ridiculous. You will burn yourself (not bad) just enough to make you mad. Also you have to have the exact amount of water for poached eggs and the timer does not turn off the machine.Cuisinart CEC-7 Egg Cooker
2,Disappointed,"Worked great the first several times we used it.. Then the egg tray got warped and water leaks all over the counter and the eggs don't cook properly. Oh, did I mention the water all over the counter? Very big problem. Guess I'll start looking for a new one..."
4,Pleasantly surprised.,"My wife wanted this product and I went along with the purchase begrudgingly. I thought an egg cooker was a waste of money and cabinet space because it's easy enough to cook eggs in pots and pans. This little device proved me wrong with many mornings of quick and easy eggs. It is very easy to use and maintain and it works consistantly well.I particularly like that I can set it running and take care of other breakfast items without worrying about overcooking or pots boiling over. The automatic shutoff is key! I also like that it is very easy to clean.We have had this egg cooker for nearly two years, and it is still working well! I only wish that it was a little more compact for storing in the cabinet... I have to admit that the egg shape is pretty cool and it definitely draws attention from visitors."
2,Get Krups 230-70 Egg Express Egg Cooker instead,"The Cuisinart egg cooker:- over/under cook the eggs according to its measuring cup- plastic tray deforms after it's heated (and stays deformed)- the metal cover burns your hand- is $10 more expensive than the Krups 230-70 Egg Express Egg Cooker, which is a much better product than Cuisinart"
4,I LOVE THIS THING,"This is the second Cuisinart Egg Cooker I've owned. I bought my other egg cooker over 5 years ago and it has held up fairly well. The buzzer and the on/off switch no longer work and the poker/measuring cup meet its demise in the garbage disposal. I bought this egg cooker not to replace the one I've owned for 5 years but to augment it. I've recently taken in a roommate and I need to be able to make 14 eggs vice just 7.If you never owned an egg cooker and eat a lot of hard boiled eggs then you HAVE to buy one. Be sure to wipe it down with vinegar after every use. I only use this to make hard boiled eggs so I can't tell you how the ""other"" eggs (soft boiled or poached eggs) turn out."
2,leaks water,cooks eggs perfectly but i end up with water all over the counter. have used for a couple of years and now (finally!) am looking for a new egg cooker.
2,"Good at first, but then problems","The quisinart egg cooker performed very well at first, but then the rack holding the eggs warped badly (its plastic, not metal), preventing the top from making a good seal. Because of this steam escapes making cooking times very unpredictable."
2,"Works, kinda","I am not an egg fan, but I make hard boiled eggs for my famous potato salad and deviled eggs. I was hoping this gadget would simplify the process and give me some hands-off cooking time to prep other ingredients.This thing is awful! It leaks water everywhere and doesn't hard boil them all the way.So what I have to do to make it work is put more water in to compensate for the water loss and set the whole thing on a towel.Also, the tray gets kinda crusty. I wipe it down after each use and it's a bunch of black stuff that comes off. I think that's odd; it's just boiling water.So I'm back to boiling on the stove."
3,No automatic shut off,This product appeared to have all the bells and whistles but now I know that was all just false advertising! It's claims to have automatic shut off when in reality it beeps to acknowledge when it's complete. If you do not turn off it goes into a sleep mode for a certain amount of time then returns to a heating mode if the om/off button is not slid to off during sleep time? I'm not sure how that handy in any circumstance!
5,Cuisinart egg cooker,Great way to cook poached eggs and hard boiled eggs. Very easy to use and easy clean up. Would highly recommend.
5,Amazing product,"I have had this for just under a month. I fix boiled eggs almost every day and one of my issues is getting the shell off of the cooked egg. After cooking in this device, I roll the eggs in a coffee cup to break up the shells. The shells then come off very easliy with out any of the egg coming with them. The eggs taste great."
1,Poorly designed piece of junk,"I used this device one time to cook hard boiled eggs. I used the measuring cup and followed the instructions exactly to the letter. Yes, my eggs were properly cooked, but the non-stick coating on the surface of the hot plate has begun to bubble and flake off - AFTER ONLY ONE USE!! This is going right back to Amazon, and I will replace it with another brand. A disappointing purchase."
1,Poor design,"We have used many egg cookers over the years that served us well and were very dissapointed in the Cuisinart CEC-7. We purchased it because of its physical appearance and that it had the Cuisinart name. It has two basic flaws:1. Water from the condensed steam leaks all over the counter when cooking eggs.2. While it cooks hardboiled eggs just fine, the consistancy of softer boiled or poached eggs is problematic. We have experimented with the amount of water used and there doesn't appear to be any exact amount that produces consistant ""cook levels"".All of the other egg cookers we have owned, while not as attractive (or durable) cooked the eggs consistantly well."
1,Not Suitable for Poaching,"This review applies only to the poaching feature of this egg ""cooker"". The plastic poaching tray insulates the bottom of the egg to the extent that the bottom is undercooked even while the steam overcooks the top. Too bad the design engineers do not understand basic laws of physics... try a metal poaching tray (like the Oster product)!"
2,Not Happy,I had this cooker for about a year and didn't use it very often. It leaked water almost from the beginning and then the beeper quit working - but it still cooked the eggs okay. I used it for the last time yesterday after all the water leaked out and what were supposed to be hard boiled eggs were very soft and almost runny. Threw it in the garbage. Won't buy another one of this brand. I think I'll try Krups.
2,No Softboiled,"This product works great for hardboiled eggs but my soft boiled eggs are consistently undercooked. It also doesn't have a measure for even amounts of eggs on the measuring cup it comes with, just odd numbers of eggs. Otherwise it is a great product."
1,Don't Buy - Don't Be Fooled by Other Reviews,"The feature that made me buy this machine was the auto-turnoff, which turns out to be a misnomer. After the eggs are cooked the machine turns itself off but if you don't go to the machine and physically turn the knob to off, IT GOES BACK ON AND CAN THEN BURN DOWN YOUR HOUSE. Obviously, I bought this so that if I forgot the eggs were cooking, which is possible if children interrupt or visitors come, the machine would turn itself off. Instead, if you don't remember to turn the button to the off position, it will turn on by itself. This machine is a danger at all times. What if after you take the eggs out, you forget to turn the button to the off position, it will go on again. Next, the noise it emits when the eggs are done is very low and HARD TO HEAR!!! If a television were on or if children were playing, I doubt that the noise signaling that the eggs are cooked could be heard by anyone. Don't buy this item."
2,Not for poached eggs,"This Cuisinart is terminally cute but not designed for ease of use and storage, and not good at all for poached eggs. For plain boiled eggs it works okay (though beware: the instructions, which call for less water if you're cooking more eggs, are counterintuitive), but you have to lose a few eggs to experiment in order to get them to come out the way you want them. The egg piercer on the bottom of the measuring cup means that the cup won't stand conveniently (and will scratch surfaces you put it on). But the real problem is poached eggs. The cups are too small for extra large eggs, and having only three cups is a recipe for discord if two people are trying to eat breakfast together. The poaching holders are flimsy plastic, so you have to crack the egg elsewhere; the sharp corners make them the devil to clean; and prying a stuck egg out is difficult at best. If you want poached eggs, look elsewhere. My mother's 30-year-old Oster still works like a dream; we returned this."
1,Egg Cooker,Use less piece of junk-counter top clutter. The eggs didn't cook correctly. A pot on the stove is much easier.
3,"Works Okay, Too Many Loose Accessories","This works okay, but I liked my old Oster better. There are too many loose parts to keep track of that fall all over the place when you take the lid off. Oster's piercing pin was built right into the base so you are not in danger of poking yourself as much as with the beaker you are using to measure water on this Cuisinart model. I like egg cookers with the measuring lines in the base of the unit; it eliminates the need for a beaker altogether. The eggs cook okay yet inconsistently from one time to the next. I'm going with another brand next time."
5,Don't know what i'll do if they quit making these!,"I use this eggcooker almost everyday of my life. My husband and i have poached eggs for breakfast...he gets 2, me 1. Just takes a few minutes and you can be cleaning the kitchen while they're cooking. It makes beautiful hardcooked eggs in minutes...no black ring. You might have to tweak how much water you add (cuz that's what determines the cooking time) but then you're all set.I've used mine for 2 straight years and bought this second one for the sad day when the first kicks the bucket."
5,Best ever,I laughed at my mom years ago when she bought an egg cooker. I bought one for my daughter as a joke when she called an asked her dad how to boil an egg! When I visited her months later she was using her Cuisinart and the ggs were perfect and the shells came off like magic. I couldn't get home fast enough after years of failed eggs. I have since purchased 3 of these as gifts. Buy it
3,Worked for awhile....,"This egg cooker suited me fine until the plastic tray that holds the eggs warped, and now it leaks water all over the counter. Why don't the make this part metal? As others have mentioned, the hole in the top exhausts almost invisible steam that will scald you if you aren't careful."
3,Auto Egg Cooker,"I bought this one based on reviews as the egg cooker I had for years finally cooked it's last egg. I will say that the non-stick coating on bottom of pan rubbed off after first use. Would be nicer if handle was on top rather than on sides where easier to get burned by heat or steam. Also, my old one had auto-shut off so that I didn't have to worry about cook time. This one, you have to listen for the beep so that you can shut it off. As is usual, nothing is made like it used to be. On the bright side, eggs are cooked correctly."
2,"Just Okay for Hard Boiled, Bad for Poaching","I have had this cooker for four years and am finally going to replace it, mostly because of the poacher. First, the cooker leaks water all over the counter so, depending on how much boils out, the poached egg can end up hard-boiled or runny. Second... I hate the shape of the finished eggs. To fit on English muffins they should be round, not oval. I know it's picky, but I end up mashing them to fit the whole thing... which gets messy if they are not completely cooked. I won't make Eggs Benedict for guests because they don't look right. The plus side is that the cooker is very attractive and looks great on my kitchen counter... I just don't like using it."
4,soft boiled eggs with little effort,"I bought this item mainly to make soft boiled eggs in the morning without having to babysit a pot on the stove. This cute little guy certainly accomplishes that. However, one thing I am not a fan of is the beeper. It sounds like a fire alarm and is nearly as piercing. While that does make me get to it *right away* to turn it off, which is probably good because it doesn't beep until all of the water is evaporated, it certainly wakes me up! But that is my only complaint - it's cute, easy to clean (I just spray vinegar into the base when it's cooled off, then use the vinegar on the rag to wipe down the top part to remove finger prints), and easy to store (great wire minder on the bottom that winds the plug in close)."
2,Would not buy again,"I have to admit, I did not buy the Cuisinart Egg Cooker through Amazon. I thought the shape was cute and I had a coupon (the influencing factors when I chose this model). I wish I hadn't. The eggs do not turn out consistently. The little egg tray warped after only one use. And as cute as the egg shape is, it makes it hard to store the cooker. I would not recommend this product. After being so dissatisfied with this unit, I bought the Krups Egg cooker, and I am much happier with the Krups Egg Cooker!"
3,works great but broke after 1 year of use,"The egg cooker worked great, see other reviews. But after just over 1 year of use, it broke down (it smells that the power supply or the wire has been fried). Well, it cookied 1000+ eggs in a year."
1,"Hard boil, fine. Poach forget it!",Looks good and works good for hard or soft boiling eggs. Don't even think about poaching eggs. The thick plastic poaching tray is so insulating that the top of the eggs overcook while the bottoms remain almost raw.I bought one and threw it away. If you like poached eggs select a different poacher.
2,quickly broke down,"I agree with the other reviewers who write that this thing leaks and is a bit dangerous. Ours started leaking gradually, but now at only 4 months of use it leaks so much that it's unusable. The steam burns were also not my favorite part of my morning. We'll be getting another egg cooker, but it won't be by Cuisinart."
2,Egg cooker leaks after 4 uses,"I had a salton for 4 years and it still worked but the plastic egg tray had broken, so I decided to replace it with the cuisinart. Boy am I sorry I threw the salton out! First, the needle to poke the shell is so blunt that I've broken two eggs trying it-luckily I had saved that from my old one. I just made the fourth set of eggs yesterday-using the same amt of water as recommended- and half way through the cooking, water just poured out from under the egg shelf it so that the cooker was sitting in a puddle of water. Not a safe place for an electric appliance. If it happens the next time, its for the trash bin and I'll be in the market for another salton."
2,i purchased 2,I purchased 2 cookers because i thought I was getting a great deal. Within 30 days the heating unit in one has broken.
2,Not as good as West Bend Egg Cooker,"I got this because it looks nicer than the white West Bend egg cooker, but so far it's been disappointing. My West Bend egg cooker lasted for two years. When it finally gave out, I bought the Cuisinart. So far, I've cooked dozens of eggs and have yet to find the right balance for the perfect soft boiled egg. I got the perfect egg every time with the West Bend one. With the Cuisinart, if i cook it for soft boil, I get raw egg white in the center. Put it to medium, and the yolk is solid. Just can't find the perfect in-between."
2,Didn't work long,"I thought I had a really good egg cooker for making my hard-boiled eggs when I bought this egg cooker. In the beginning everything worked well. After about 6 months, I noticed water seeping out of the cooker onto the counter during cooking. This affects the cooking time and the eggs started not cooking through. I always cook the maximum 7-egg capacity and I also noticed that some eggs were done more than others. Since the eggs were all the same size I can only conclude that there are hot and cool spots causing uneven cooking. Expected better from Cuisinart."
2,DANGER,"DO NOT TAKE THE LID OFF OF THIS UNIT UNTIL IT IS COOL. I removed the lid when i was pouching eggs and sustained a severe burn on my finger. It works great, but be careful!"
1,Deceptive Marketing,The description said auto shut-off but it turns out shut-off is NOT automatic. I have to shut-off manually.The manual confirms this. Terribly upset to discover this. I am returning this item. It feels like I am the victim of deceptive marketing.
1,Piece of garbage displayed in a cute little package,"I, too, have been burned by the steam coming out of the holes on the top of the lid. Also, the poaching bowl only has room to poach 3 eggs at one time and it does a lousy job at that. It hard cooks the yolk while the white is still runny - go figure. My Oster lasted for years until one day it just said ""I'm not working anymore"". However, up until that point it was the best egg cooker I ever owned. I will be purchasing another Oster (through Amazon) since I cannot find it in any stores here in my area. TAKE HEED - DO NOT BUY Cuisinart's piece of junk egg cooker! (Although they do make a nice coffee maker.)"
4,A must have appliance if you like eggs.,I lived in Europe for 10yrs. and upon my first year I was introduced to the egg cooker. It is so quick and easy that it was love at first sight. You find the perfect level of water to put in for the way you like your boiled egg and it comes out perfect every time. This is a must have for anyone who likes to cook the perfect egg in the morning or when ever.4 stars instead of 5 because the plastic egg holder does get warped and the cup for measuring the water and piercing the egg tends to get cracked after long term use. This is only to be expected. If you rarely cook eggs then you don't need this however if you have children and or like to have a perfect egg in the morning with out having to stand over the stove and watch/time it then this is for you. It is easy and safe enough for children to use. Just be mindful of the steam when removing the cover.
1,Poorly designed,"I have had various egg cookers over the years and I bought this because it is Cuisinart. It cooks the eggs inconsistently. I tried using the exact measurements on the cup and they came out over-cooked. I tried reducing the water level and it is hit-and-miss. And, the handle on the lid is really small and it is almost impossible not to get scalded when lifting it at the end of the cooking. I am going back to Chef's Choice."
4,I love this egg cooker!,"This thing is awesome! It does soft, medium and hard boiled eggs perfectly every time. Have never tried poached, so I wouldn't know how that turns out, but this is a gadget I wouldn't want to be without."
2,My egg exploded,"So far not so good.. I tried getting medium hard eggs this morning and the result was one exploded egg, which was so hard i could use it to fix plumbing, and the other one was kinda okay, but too hard for my liking. I'm going to give this little tool a chance and adjust the water next time, but I did follow the instructions, pierced the egg, and was not impressed by the result so far."
2,Not impressed,"I love Cuisinart, so when I saw this, I saw a chance to ""upgrade"" from the Egg Genie. Mistake.I like the stainless steel top and the compact design and the egg piercer on the cup, rather than on the egg holder, but that's where it ends.I've burned my hand on the top, which gets super hot because it's stainless steel. It leaks water all over the counter because the well doesn't seem to be deep enough. And there is always one egg that explodes. I'm quite disappointed with this product."
1,TERRIBLE,"Beware - the tray which holds the eggs warps badly, so the lid and heating part can't close tightly. So - wasting all that steam, how much water should you actually use? .... I'm a good cook and I buy sensibly so items perform as described. Cuisinart used to have a good rep. Guess they don't care how well an item performs as long as they get their bucks. I won't bother with them again."
3,Buyer Beware!,"Although this card has the highest recommendations, beware as to not get burnt. This card will not work with alot of motherboards...especially older LX boards. I suggest waiting awhile until games made for the card come out or the price comes down a bit."
3,Not the best... but not the worst eaither.... and it will play,"This is not my favorite Bowie CD but it's not terrible. It helped to finish up my collection of not commonly heard Bowie songs and so I was quite happy with this purchase. Some of the songs sound a bit similar and it doesn't touch the depth or feeling in Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars... but in all it's a decent CD. I did not have any trouble with the CD playing. It plays on my computer, in my portable CD player and the CD player in my car. I'm sure that the previous person who said it doesn't play just got a defective CD."
1,"Another calalog retread, this one unplayable","I rate David Bowie a genius, and among the few of his contemporaries to stay, well, contemporary. But how many times will his back catalog be re-branded? The selection of songs here is judicious, and the liners a nice keepsake with photos and track listings from each of the anthologized releases. But you'd better be content with that, because the CD itself WILL NOT PLAY.This Copy Control technology seems a bit shortsighted when the inability to even PLAY purchased music sends one running to internet sites for illegal downloads that at least can be heard. Your thoughts, EMI?"
5,A family guide to basic outdoor survival skills,Survival expert Jerry Younkins brings you this valuable instructional video to make your hunting or camping trip safe and more emjoyable. HOW TO FIND FOOD< WATER AND SHELER.. WILDERNESS NAVIGATION. BASIC FIRST AID
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge fan of DBZ and have been for the past 8 years. However, these 3 movies prove to be the WORST out of all 13. The animation and plot were extremely lacking and I found myself almost wanting to stop watching halfway through. It was very predictable and boring. You're much better off with any of the other movies; worlds strongest, tree of might, brolly, brolly returns, bojack, etc. You'll thank me later."
5,Good work,The Bach family has an important place in classical music history and this album has been done nicely by Hermann Max. I recomend this Capriccio disc to all Bach enthusiasts.
3,2 Long Boxes More Helpful--and Cheaper,"This laser device helped me a little keep my putter straight, but I found it difficult to see the laser without looking to my left, which is not the correct putting technique. Ultimately, I found it much more useful to line up two long cardboard boxes and swing my putter between them--a simple drill used extensively by the pros. That helped more than this laser device. To its credit, it does function as advertised."
1,dont buy it what a ripoff,I tried it but the laser is off by a mile and no way to align it. It was 4 inches left from 10 feet.
4,Works great,"It was really easy to set up. You can put it on your favorite putter in seconds and be checking your aim. This ease of use is great if you're comparing various putters since you just line them up, put the device on the putter, check the resulting aim, and then move onto the next."
3,NOT Complete at all!,"Had this been as stated, complete, I would have given it 5 stars. But it's not only just 8 episodes, the episodes skip much of the storyline in between. Suddenly in the disc's episode 3, unless you watched the series, you'll wonder why Renee's wife, Edith is courting another man. They left out episodes were Renee is ""shot"" then comes back with a cover of being Renee's twin brother (also named Renee). Also you miss finding out that the old forgerer is an old love of Edith's mother and that it is he who creates the forgery painting of the Madonna for the Germans.They should have titled this ""Best of"" instead of complete. Because it will never be complete unless they plan on issuing episodes out of order.This show deserved better treatment!"
2,Allo Allo - series 1,The quality of sound and picture on this DVD was quite disappointing. Hope that the next series becomes available soon and is of better quality. Expected better from the BBC
1,Same old jokes again and again,"I had to sit through this as a child - it's so bad, really bad jokes and 2-d characters."
5,Be ready to spit out your popcorn when you laugh...,"I thought my parents were NUTS when I first saw them watching this when it was on PBS. Then I stayed to watch it one night and I was hooked. It is an absolute farce. Only the Brits could make such a ridiculous comedy and get away with all they did in that show. I've so far only ordered the first series, but I never saw those, having not gotten interested in the show until it was further along. I am so glad I did, and plan to order the rest of the series as well, as it's too hysterical not to have. The cast is fantastic, the one-liners are sharp, and the acting is superb. I gave it 5 stars only because Amazon doesn't have 10 in their rating system. Get it, and enjoy! It's great for a laugh after a tough day!"
4,Equilateral Lampoon,"Approaching such a sensitive subject as the Nazi Occupation this delightful series manages to avoid both the desire for manifest screwball as well as the overly sentimental. In a few short minutes each episode manages to skewer stereotypes of the Resistance, the Wehrmacht, British valor, homosexuality and the time-tired notion of the prostitute with the heart of gold. This is well worth the time for anyone who appreciates dry, slightly off-step, British humor."
3,It OK.,"I have only watched one or two episodes of series one. They are a little stale - not as funny as I remember from twenty years ago. Hope unseen segments will be more entertaining. If not, I will not be buying any more episodes. Disappointed."
4,Tips,"Mr Forcade has put a lot of information into this book in a very nice format. However, I wanted to pass a tip along to those just looking for basic screw design information and they do not have a lot of money - go to Goodman Conveyor's, where Forcade works, web site and request their screw conveyor catalog. It is not as detailed as this book, but it does cover the basics. However if you can afford this book do buy it, as it has things you'll never know you need until after the fact."
2,Not as completed as I expected,This book did not fullfill all my expectations. The fact that the calculation methods for inclined conveyors are not shown do not give much worth to this book. Almost every information given in the book can be found for free in the net. I am dissapointed with this book.
5,Volvo history - airplane reading,Short history about the Volvo brand - 1975 - a little dated. Cute drawing on the Dust Jacket with some historical black and white photos. Nice lap reading while on the plane. Interesting too.
5,One of the best out there.,I like the teacher's style. He makes things clear and easy to understand.
2,No close-captioning available as advertised. Good tutorials.,"Great tutorials, but I bought this older version specifically because it did say it has close-captioning capability. Even with my TV settings adjusted for CC (SONY BRAVIA), the DVD would still not enable its supposed feature. Disappointing, but still some very good tutorials. I don't mind the no-frills approach and tend to go for substance over slick graphics and all the bells and whistles. This teaching method works well for me and my deaf son, though I do need to spend time interpreting the lessons for him. It's certainly never a bad thing to spend study time with your kid. I just wish this was made available as promoted so he could benefit from it when I am not available."
4,Very helpful,"There are few Algebra DVD videos to be found and this was the one I could find at the time. I only wish the production of the DVD video had been more polished and professionally done. Otherwise, I believe you will find it helpful to see problems being explained as they are done. Try viewing it on your computer, instead of the TV. The only reason for a 4 star rather than a five is the production issue."
5,The Math Video Tutor. Great!!!,"I went back to college and math isn't my thing, but the Math Video Tutor is just great. Get it for yourself or your children. Great product!"
3,Just Ok,"This DVD will be of minimal help unless you get the companion CD and actually work out the problems for yourself. I would say the price of the CD was a bit too expensive for the poor quality of the vidoe. And it's pretty poor. If you're using windows media just keep the video viewing on the small size and do not enlarge it. Basically, just a guy talking with a white borad; eraser and magic marker. Nothing fancy."
5,Love this course!,"Math Tutor[dot]com is awesome. Growing up I had always struggled with math. It remained a stumbling block for years. But I recently started college, and math is now a big part of my life. Without Mr Gibson's DVD, I would not be faring very well. What I really like about this series is how it's bundled into bite sized bits. It makes digesting much easier. No drudgery here! Not only is my math improving, I'm actually having fun while learning. I would recommend this course to anyone. Thanks a lot, Mr Gibson!"
1,A bit disappointing,"I purchased this two-disk DVD and looked forward to refreshing my knowledge of mathematics. I realize there need not be much rehearsal for this type of training aid, but I was a bit disappointed as a mistake was made during part of a presentation and not corrected later.In short, I do not recommend it."
1,should be 0 star but I don't have that option,"Junk of poorly educated fellow made out of a poorly equipedgarage is all I can say about this video. I bought it for myson to review and within minutes he is tired of the mistakesthe ""white board and a hand"" are making, things like ""7 dividedby 3 equlas 6 point something"". Now amazon.com doesn't allowthe return of opened DVD but how can I know amazon.com sellthese kind of junk without openning it?"
1,Waste of Time and Money,"Poor, broken presentation. The 'teacher' has to consult his sheaf of hand-written notes to solve problems he is supposed to work out! Pathetic sight indeed. But would benefit the football jocks with IQ < 80, I guess (which is the target audience in any case...so...)"
2,10 Hours of math on a single 4.7G DVD! Hello!!!,"I previously purchased another DVD in this series and was impressed, so I decided to purchase this one. I was a bit apprehensive because it stated it was 10 hours of math on a single 4.7G DVD and that just didn't make sense.I found out I was right to be suspicious, the picture quality is simply awful. This should have been recorded on three DVD's to bring the picture quality up to an acceptable level.The tutorial is very good, Gibson explains things plainly and clearly, even to the point of stating where mathematics uses ""silly"" terms and ""names"" that often makes algebra confusing for some. This DVD is of great help for people requiring algebra assistance, but be warned, the picture quality is NOT very good."
2,Don't Judge this Series by this title,"I love Jason's videos but someone should have caught all of the errors in this dvd. Whether it is the publisher of the dvd- some kind of editor- or Jason himself- such big mistakes should not have been overlooked. It is completely irresponsible to provide an educational help video that provides wrong answers. I am reviewing basic math concepts for a higher level math course and the mistakes were easily caught- but to a person who is learning this stuff for the first time, some of these sections would confuse them more than anything else. He seems like a great guy and I highly recommend ANY of the other titles he has made- just either stay away from this title or buy it but keep your eyes open to catch the mistakes, otherwise you might get a little confused."
5,Great Product!,I had nearly given up on Algebra until I found this DVD. It just goes to show that the teacher really does matter. I had a terrible teacher in class which really turned me off to Algebra...but this instructor is so clear that anyone can undertand it!
3,Good Content - Poor Presentation,"I'll admit I was disappointed when I popped this DVD in my laptop. I couldn't believe that it consisted of a fairly unsophisticated narrative over a fairly unsophisticated use of a white board. It seemed unpolished and unprofessional, while the content seems easy to grasp and thorough. Buzzing, poor quality video, children talking in the background, I can't really say I feel I got my monies worth, though I don't know of any better products available.I am somewhat surprised it got so many good reviews, but again, it may be in part due to lack of competition."
5,Jason Gibson and MathtutorDVD's are amazing!,"We are a homeschool family and use these DVD's. My oldest daughter has gone from this DVD to Advanced Calculus in a little less than 2 years. Here's what she said: ""The course was easy to comprehend and pretty much, the courses all flowed into each other. Once I stopped working with this DVD, for example, and started working in Algebra workbooks, I understood the workbooks completely."" She is 14 years old. Thanks, Jason!"
5,Spike!!,Nice & detailed action figure of Spike - William the Bloody! James Marsters character on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel series starring David Boreanaz.
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"This book is the biggest joke. First of all, anyone who quotes Sleepers and Beverly Hills, 90210 seriously in his book should not have gotten a publisher. Second, anyone who would have an interest in reading this book would also be a fan of The Real World (no one I know who dislikes the show would waste their time), so Joe's trashing of the show and how it ruined his life is of no interest to me. He is vague and disjointed in telling his story, and even his pictures on the inside are out of order. The only interesting part is finding out if he stayed with his 8 foot girlfriend, and if you want to know, skim it in a bookstore. I skimmed it the night I bought it, and returned it the next day. Go buy the Insider's Guide instead."
1,Joe's book suck... even in the real world.,"Joe, tries to show us that the show screwed up his life. The whole book seems to be him whining, and crying because he choose to do something he later regreted. How MTV and The Real World screwed up his life... yet all over the book, and inside it says Joe, 'the guys from MTV's The Real World, he only used that much for marketing. Saying how much his life was turned upside down. He never talks about the positive aspects, only the things that went wrong, which in turn makes him sound like a concieted person. Everyones issues he discusses always goes back to his whiny girlfriend and their problems. I don't suggest this book to my worst enemy. Fan or no fan."
5,Joe Tells it like it was!,I am a big fan of the real world Miami and this book was very eye-opening about the happenings behind the camera. Joe held nothing back :) I found myself laughing at loud at the antics Joe brings to light. I have read it a few times and I would highly recommend it to anyone who was or is a Fan of RWMiami :) Lisa
4,A M-U-S-T for any Real World fan,"After reading this, I really have to commend Joe for sharing even more of his life than he did on the show, or should I say what the producers would show of him. Unlike that first review up there, I didn't see it as 'little Joe bashing back.' It really seemed more about his life, and the show was just a part of it. Out of the fifty or so people who have done Real World, I don't think there is even one who can say it had a positive effect on his/her life. So saying that it hurt him isn't slandering his integrity. But for all the fans out there, there definetley is enough juicy details packed in that should grab a lot of people's attention."
2,Disappointing and poorly written,"Poor Joe: He really needs to pull himself together. He, throughout, blames ""The Real World"" for his cataclysmic life during and after the show -- however, I clearly got the impression that Joe barely had one foot in the real world to begin with. One more thing, Joe: Stop carrying on and forget about this Nic already."
5,The book was wonderful!,"I felt the book gave the fans a wonderful insight as to what really goes on behind the cameras. I would strongly recommend this book to any hardcore Real World fan. The authors view on how the show strongly damaged his outside relationships and life is very touching. I feel very honored the Joe Patane would let the fans into his world like he did, open up, and share with us how the show has affected his life."
2,small print on old yellowed pages,The tiny paperback not in a pleasant format to read. The pages are old and yellowed and stiff. I Would have liked a newer version than the 1956 printing
1,Digital Message that breaks,"I bought this back in May of 2010 & I have been using it to display names of dances while DJing but now it decided to stop working. I changed the battery on the remote thinking that was the problem, but NO it is still broken and the message is stuck on only one dance instead of the 10 that I had programmed. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone since it is supposed to be for cars that move around all the time and I had this thing on top of the counter and it still broke. Not worth the cheap price that's for sure! I guess you get for what you pay!"
1,No good,I had this product a few days and it quit working. I can't even get a tech or represenative to help me in returning or exchanging this product. Your put on hold for more than 30 minutes and still nothing.
2,ok,"The product is alright. It does what it says it is suppose to do, yet does not stop repeating the demo message. If you are able to disable the demo then it was not easily described how to in the manual. It does not power off as long as it is pluggged in and will run the batery of your car down if you forget to unplug it. Overall not worth the money. Needs improvement"
5,"""Motivated to Serve""","I initially wanted to purchase the volume series to place in my library. This product is definitely good for reasearch, whether you are a beginner, inter-mediate, or advanced Bible researcher; and for the price, it's definitely worth it."
5,politics aside,"I love Margaret Cho, but I have to admit that her new positioning is better and more creative than her previous. In her newest show, ASSASSIN (not part of this collection), she is far more political, which for me, is more interesting and frankly, funnier. It's worth, of course, owning all of CHO's work. She is now part of the legendary group of comics that deserve to be heard by all. She has taken the torch from such legengs as Lenny Bruce and George Carlin, and Cho will likely play a role in protecting us from the 'right'."
3,"first two great, 3rd sucked",The first two movies in the set are excellent and extremely funny- a must for all margaret cho fans... the 3rd movie where she had lost weight was the least funny thing ive seen in a long time. I actually threw the 3rd movie away because I think I may have chuckled once during the whole thing!
4,2 Outa 3 Ain't Bad,"In the immortal words of that other big-boned superstar: 2 outa 3 aint bad.You're The One That I Want and Notorious C.H.O. are quite simply the funniest stand up routenes I've ever witnessed. I can watch them over and over again. They are not only laugh out loud funny, they are inspirational. I wanted to replace my video copies with DVDs and the boxed set seemed like a great deal. And I guess it is if you think of Revolution as a bonus DVD of out takes. Some gems to be found in there but overall it just pales by comparison. I really hope the next is a return to form."
3,A little repetitive.,"The video was fun for a while, but the footage was filmed at the exact same rapid over an extended peroid and got a little old after the first half hour even though it was different carnage."
4,A Summer for a Lifetime,"Having lived in Japan for most of the past two decades I am in constant awe of those foreigners who preceeded me, and succeeded, in business, and in life. George Purdy has been one of the most influential foreigners in Japan for an awfully long time, 30 years before I came.Mr. Purdy has great respect in both the foreign and Japanese communities in Japan, and with this book we can begin to capture a glimpse of just why he is so well respected.As an entrepreneur in Japan, somewhat successfull, I have spent time thinking of the issues about what makes a person successfull. Financial success is not the same as being a success in life. Mr. Purdy has achieved both, and gives some thought as to what is success in life.Thomas Caldwell, the author, has done a wonderful job of highlighting interesting events in the life of a most interesting person."
4,Reasonable review of psych,"Although this ""review"" text was not designed for this purpose, my son used this to prepare for the CLEP test. It includes a basic, easy to read, summary of general psychology."
4,Three Stars Just for Rajasthan ...Four Stars for Shreyas Talpade,"I caught this at the Indo-Arts Film Festival in New York. First thing, is the haunting stark beauty of rajastahn, if you can't get a good shot with your camera there then give up making films.Gul Panag plays an intelligent, beautiful dedicated woman...which is what she is in real lifeShreyas Talpade is one of the best natural comedians I have ever seen. He almost stole the film (difficult to do with Gal and Rajasthan in the picture :)"
2,Solaray Organic Burdock root,"I was disappointed with this product. This product made me dizzy, and somewhat disoriented. I took it for two weeks thinking, at first, it was a new herbal product and my body just needed to get used to it. After two weeks the symptoms became worse. I became concerned and searched the Internet for Burdock root side effects. I learned that my symptoms were typical if the product had been mixed with Belladonna, which can be toxic at higher levels. I immediately discontinued this product. I also noticed that there was an additional label affixed to the bottle that stated a different dosage that the original label on the bottle. I threw the product away and ordered a bottle of Nature's Answer Burdock root. I have been taking the Nature's Answer Burdock root for two weeks now, and I have not experienced any of the side effects that I experienced with Solaray Burdock root. Maybe I received a bad batch, but I would not recommend this product."
5,"If we could only have 10 kids books, this would be one!","We have kids and lots of books. This is must have. The kids love it, and we do too. Very well written and great illustrations. If we did not have kids I would have purchased it!"
4,Poetry meant to be read aloud,"In the tradition of Robert Service. Irreverant, funny... even bacchanalian at times.There is an innocense about it as it describes our lives before, as a society, we thought we knew so much...The author was Paul Newman's uncle."
4,Another Great Collectable From Godzilla Monsters,I Purchased this for my Grandsons 6th birthday and he loves it. He is in the process of collecting as many Godzills monsters as possible. This did not have a box but did come with a tag and is an official Bandai product.
2,Two thumbs down,"I'm sorry girls but I didn't like this one, the instructer is just a little to peppy, and the ladies following her just look like manicanes. Not just that but it wasn't as hard as I like it, I perfer to sweat up a storm, also some of the moves I have never seen before and didn't feel like they were working anything. Definitly, the cardio part was way to low impact for me I perfer a heart pumping working this one is more just movement. The band was different but I also didn't feel like it worked too much. Also, the lightening, and backgrounds, and the way it was shot was a little cheesy. I also own the Women's Health Wedding Workout and it is awesome it really makes you sweat and incorpartes alot athletic moves. So far it's my fave!"
3,Cheaper than a trainer,"This is good if you don't want to actually spend money on hiring a trainer. If you have enough motivation on your own and are a self starter I would recommend this DVD. However, to really get in the shape you want to be for your wedding, you will need to do more than just Buff Brides...."
2,Disappointed,You would have to be a serious couch potatoe to get any kind of challenge from this video. Not to mention it's C-H-E-E-S-Y!! I could do it more than once and feel good about myself. I was better off doing 20 girl push ups.
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this workout. Mia does not cue well at all. She cues on the move, not before and several times says she's going to ""put it all together"", but she introduces new moves instead. Also, when she couts down to a change in moves, she will count with the left leg leading, but then begin the move on the right leg and vice versa. The cardio is not intense at all and way too short. The toning segments are better, but still not great. The toning band that is included is of poor quality. It's too long to use as is, but if I double it up (as recommended on a card included with the workout), then it's too short. I'm sorry I purchased this one."
1,A little entertaining,I watched the video and thought that it was a little entertaining but not a great workout. It's a little cheesy. It might be good for someone that has never worked out as it is an easy workout.
4,Buff Brides,"This is the best workout on DVD I have ever purchased. I have been using this DVD for 2 weeks & have found it to be an intense workout. I have already lost 6lbs & can actually see a difference in how firm I am becoming. I am getting married June 1, 2007 & I am going to look dynamite in my wedding dress."
3,Its an OK workout...,"Not sure if the book is much better in terms of a workout...this DVD is definitely for the beginner exerciser. The segments are very short, I barely got out of breath. The cardio segment is very quick and you don't do much besides marching and grapevines. The weight segment for your arms and back are in a very quick sequence, which doesn't give you time to switch up the weights (since you work your arms and back which differ in size it would be nice to have time to change from 5 lb to 8 lb). The last segment for your hips and abs is probably the best but that is not saying much. I can see doing this workout just to do SOMETHING if you are a little out of shape or don't like sweaty workouts. However, for a real butt kicking definitely get you in shape workout for your wedding, I highly recommend The Firm workouts. After those you WILL feel the burn."
2,loved the book...,"but the dvd is a disappointment. I thought it would be the workout in the book... so that rather than just a picture, I could listen or watch... But its not... Its totally different. Focuses on cardio, work with a band, etc. I'm sure its not a bad work out, but I really like the format of the book, I've only been working on it for 3 or 4 weeks now and can already see a difference. I returned the DVD."
3,let down,"The work out wasn't all that great. It gave a few new moves I hadn't seen before, but not all that beneficial. The band was a pain to use and keep on you. I think you should save your money and get a better workout somewhere else."
2,Not at all challenging,"Having not worked out for over a year, I did this workout for the first time and didn't even break a sweat. I can only see it being useful for beginning exercisers who are extremely sedentary. Also, the instructor is irritatingly peppy (""Throw those bouquets, girls!"") Ugh. I recommend the Women's Health Wedding Workout instead; it's much more challenging, especially for upper-body toning."
2,So-So Workout,"This DVD offers only a so-so workout, it's nothing special. I didn't feel like I'd worked my body much by the time I was done. Also, unless you're into having to learn choreography to get a workout this is not the DVD for you. There's not as much as there is on some DVD's I've seen, but there's enough to throw off your workout and keep you from getting full benefit. The only other comment I have is that the band that came with my DVD was nothing like that used in the workouts. Mine was much thinner, plus it was a lot bigger around, which meant that I had to keep finding ways to try to fold it or wrap it around my ankles to try to achieve even minimum resistance. All in all, if you're only going to get one DVD to get in shape for your wedding, my best advice would be to keep looking. Believe it or not, I tried a beginning yoga DVD after this (I've never tried yoga before) - boy, did I get a workout!"
5,Excellent cable,This is a an excellent cable. No problem so far. Highly recommended. Short cable reduces mess by the switch box.
5,Trap Line,Another fun book by Hiaason! He keeps the reader glued to the pages as the story unfolds. I am always lloking foreward to what happens next. Can hardly wait for his next.
3,"Suspenseful, but where's that bizarre Hiaasen humor?","Apparently this book was written long before Hiaasen's other classics, like Skin Tight and Stormy weather. While the plot is interesting, and the characters are either likeable or pathetic, the odd-balls you expect in a Hiaasen novel are absent. However, I'm such a Hiaasen junkie I bought it anyway! Decent summer read."
2,Not in Line with the Quality of other Hiaasen Novels,"This 1982 re release is no where near the same masterpiece quality of Hiaasen's later work or even written in the same style. In fact I'd hazard a guess as to say the other author Bill Montalbano wrote most of this and now that Hiaasen has become a household name the publishers are trying to cash in by putting Hiaasen's name at the top of the cover of thie rerelease. The book is set in Florida, that is pretty much the only similarity I can see to the great Hiaasen novels such as Strip Tease, Double Whammy, Skinny Dip, Sick Puppy and Lucky You. There's no surreal humorous likeable (or unlikeable) characters in here, no three or more separate storylines converging and crossing over each other, just no real fast paced enjoyment that we have to expect from Hiaasen.Don't waste your money. Buy one of the masterpiece Hiaasen novels instead."
5,Trap Line,"This book is by an author I enjoy, Carl Haissen. I enjoyed the story line and it kept me interested and routing for the main character. The delivery of the book was great so I was able to enjoy it quickly and in very good condition."
5,funny,keeps you smiling all the way through. Carl Hiaasen has done it once again.Relax and enjoy yourself as you read and be ready to split a gut
3,Trap Line,Ive read several of Carl Hiaasen books. There aways seems to be a twist which is something you will only find in Florida. However this book also had a plot that is different than the other books I have read and made it even more enjoyable.
4,Fun read!,"This book has a new cast of characters and the usual twists and turns of a Hiassen Novel. It still involves Florida nd the environment and gives a good picture of the Florida Keys, lobster fishing, and small town life, albeit with some pretty unusal, but believable, characters."
4,Truth,Hiaasen nails it with the corruption and trap locals got caught up in the drug running days. This book's been around awhile but I just read it. Anyone that lived thru the 80's in South Florida would enjoy this read.
3,Not the Carl Hiaasen I Love,"It was OK, but certainly not up to Hiassen's later efforts. An OK read and some fun moments. A look into the infancy of this author's work."
3,Trap Line,"This story lacks the ""Hiaasen"" humor that I so enjoyed in his past books.It was an okay read but can't compare to Sick Puppy or Skin Tight."
4,easy read,always a joy to read his books he's the only author that i have ever read any of his books twice
2,Disappointed,"Purchased the item and all appeared fine. After a while a noticed that the indicating pointer appeared to hang up and that I would have to gently tap on the gauge to get an accurate reading.I did however read the followly:""Since the action depends on the expansion and contraction of metallic components, the response to ambient temperature change is not immediate""THIS IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT..........The gauge will fixate on a given temperature and stay there way too long for it to be considered accurate. Maybe this one is defective? I have had this thing for almost a year and should have sent it back, not worth it."
3,The backside please?,"Sorry, this is not a review, but a request. On these types of objects that are designed to swivel, why can't Amazon show photos of the backside of the object? What's this thermometer look like from behind?"
5,"""More a study guide, but you won't be disappointed!""","As with all Dr. Stanley's works, this one is excellent! It is more of a study guide than a self-help book. Nevertheless, the book is grounded in scripture and replete with examples! Right up there with 'Mizraim Principles' on what we can all learn through God's discipline!Also recommended: 'The Mizraim Principles', 'With Joseph in the University of Adversity'"
5,adversity,This is a great book. Easy to read and full of information that will help you to discover why adversity is needed in the life of the Christiian. This is a good teaching tool.
5,Great Introduction,"My mom purchased a killer used table saw, but lacked the confidence in how to use it. I bought this book as a gift for her and ended up reading it before I gave it to her!As a girl, I watched my Dad in the shop, but he didn't like questions so I grew bored. Now, I wish I'd have paid attention and tried to use it when I had his tutelage. This book answered a lot of the questions I have about using a table saw and safety. I can now discuss ""shop"" with my husband and understand what he's talking about. I might even be brave enough to use a table saw now! :) I liked that some of the pictures in the book depicted women using the saw too!As the other reviewer said, this doesn't go into detail for techniques for specific projects, but will give you an overview of what to look for in a table saw, how to maintain your table saw, and what you can do with your table saw. You won't become a pro overnight, but this book is a good primer to get you started."
5,Valuable information,"I give this book 5 stars because of the great information revealed in the two studies presented. It is a snapshot of how the topic of ritual abuse was addressed in the early 1990s - the laws that were on the books, what children's families were reporting, what adults were reporting. Like the title says, details of ""who, what, where, when and why"" are presented. The book is lacking in some of its conclusions and analysis, but much of that is probably due to the newness of the subject and inability to see where the country was heading. Her website: [...] gives a fresh perspective, I find more realistic."
1,Wrongheaded,"I've seen too much damage come out of the trumped-up ritual abuse hysteria of the '80s/'90s. Thank God (yes, I'm a Christian), that this mostly-imagined phenomenon is no longer ""happening."" This book, while well-intentioned, is not based in reality."
2,Great laptop but the batteries don't work right,"I returned my first new 15"" Powerbook (M9969LL/A) within three weeks because the battery literally only ran for 10 minutes on a full charge at that point. Now the second unit is only 3 days old and I'm only seeing a 1-hour battery life on a full charge! I'm obviously hoping (like others) that Apple will address this issue, because other than the battery problem I love this laptop. My 2-year old Thinkpad T42 still runs 2-3 hours on a full charge with full screen-brightness and no battery saving features turned on. I have not experienced any problems with the screen like other users."
2,Broke in 2 months,"My PowerBook G4 15 incher suffered a processor board failure after a mere two months of use. It had to be shipped out to an Apple repair facility and I have been without it for almost two weeks. No, Apple did not offer me a ""loaner"" while the PowerBook was in the shop.Sure I have backed up my files and got by with my old computer but the PowerBook is marketed as a professional's computer and I find this failure inexcuseable for a $2,000+ top-of-the-line laptop.Do not buy this product until Apple gets its quality assurance act together!"
5,Superb laptop,"This is a simply superb machine. It's a Porsche of laptops, vastly classier and more sophisticated than Windows machines. I'm a long-time Windows user, but am in the process of switching over to the Mac for all personal & most business use.Tiger with its Searchlight function is a fantastic op system - at least a decade ahead of Windows XP Pro. Yes, the machine is expensive, and no, it's not a gamer's machine, but for anyone who is creative, intelligent, and adult, there is no better choice.Get the PowerBook. Like me, you'll never look back."
4,Best G4 Powerbook,"Most Powerful G4 Powerbook w/ a 15"" screen. Could use more RAM, at least 1 gig. Trumped by the new Intel MacBooks."
2,Quality Control Issues,"Sadly, I have to add my voice to other customers who have received a defective Powerbook. Apple puts incredible thought and sophistication into design and form factors, but judging by my experience and what others have posted, something has gone wrong with their QC.When I opened Apple's beautiful packaging, I found that the finish on the laptop's lid suffered from several small imperfections (the aluminum was pitted in one spot and in another place had an uneven, almost scratched look.This was annoying, to say the least. But I decided I'd overlook these small flaws, as they were purely cosmetic. What I couldn't overlook was that the battery wouldn't charge! Others in this forum have noted that their new machine came with a dead battery and flawed screens. My screen was gorgeous, with no dead pixels or other flaws. But the combination of the flawed lid and dead battery was too much for a $2,000 purchase, so I'm (sadly) returning the Powerbook to Amazon."
2,"Defective Screens on ALL 15"" Powerbooks","I really wanted to like this Powerbook, but these latest models have been particularly troublesome.The first unit I received had a completely dead battery (wouldn't hold any charge), horizontal lines running across the screen (see other reviews), and several stuck keys.The second unit has a working battery (lasts 3:30 on a charge) and perfect keyboard, but there are STILL horizontal lines visible on the screen.My advice is to wait until Apple fixes these problems before spending $2k on a Powerbook."
2,Bad Mac,"I'm not sure what's up at Apple but they have slipped up on QC for their new 15.2"" powerbooks. I'm now packing up the second replacement for return to Amazon. And am going to have to wait another three weeks for what I suspect is another defective 15."" The first arrived with a partially defective hard drive. The second had a dead battery that refused to charge (Apple is sending out another). But what instigated the return is that I cannot get the ethernet cable to detach from the computer. (I've got a PhD in bioinformatics and have rigged my house with custom cat 5 ethernet cable so I pretty sure I'm doing the obvious). What's up Apple? Your operating system is awesome but your QC seems quite poor. Any chance you'll allow us to install Tiger on a T43 Thinkpad? On a second note, I have seen the horizontal lines but for both machines it's not been a big issue."
1,not happy,"this product was not what it was suppose to be.got a none working product, after delivery found out that nothing was as it is suppose to be.this is junk I rate this at below zero no good"
2,Repair,"If you plan on buying this laptop, be aware that there have been issues with the memory slots on this model. Apple has issued a repair extension program to help owners deal with this. Unfortunately this program only applies to 1.5 GHz and 1.67 GHz machines. A number of people with 1 GHz and 1.25 GHz machines are having the same failure, but I am not aware of any help for these machines.See[...]for more details."
5,You are definitely my baby,"i played this cd to death, you never cease to amaze methis album is uplifting, moving and simply touchingeveryone that i let hear this album, they couldn't believe that this was an older lady killing it the way she was. you feel because she's been in the business since the 80's you feel that she will loose it and wouldn't know how to adapt to the new sound. the woman is singing it as if she as be singing in the new style all her life i love every track You go girl. you are simply anointedand anything you sings touches my heart"
1,No water pressure,"Water tastes good, but if you mind waiting more than 2 minutes to fill your glass up then look elsewhere!!"
4,Great tasting water!,This worked great removing bad taste from water and was a breeze to replace at the 6 month interval. This worked great other than the flow being extremly slow. That is the only reason for 4 stars
2,Interesting Rework of The ol Rock opera,"In my opinion, worth having just to hear PT rework of amazing journey and some nifty acoustic guitar. Nice orchestral arrangement of the Overture.The rest is ok. Should not be a purchase in a new who collection (again in my pompous opinion). Wait until ya have the ""basics"" first."
3,Cheesy knife,"The knife is excellent quality, just like the other wusthof knives. however, it doesn't cut hard cheese much better than cheaper knives i have at home. there is nothing etched into the blade, as the description would have you believe. the etched detail on the blade is just painted on the surface, and doesn't do anything to make it easier to cut cheeses like cheddar."
3,"Good info, but not for novices.","This book contains a great variety of information about using eBay, but it is not geared to the novice eBay user. The book addresses those wishing to use eBay as an antique/collectible sales business, and for those folks, it is a good book."
2,If you are an antique dealer already this is not the book for you.,"As someone who sells antiques I expected this book to give me information on how to sell antiques - on ebay. Instead, this book is primarily focused on what I already know, the basics on how to identify and sell antiques, followed by some very basic info on posting them on ebay. Very disappointing."
2,Could be better,Just not up to all the hype the title gives you. Common sense and a little business sense on Ebay you could write the same book. Save your money or buy another book on antiques or collectables.
4,snowleopard,"As a collector and eBay seller, I found this book helpful in both areas. I have collected fine arts for several year and the book has good information is this respect. As a beinning eBay person I also found it helpful. The authors seem to know what they are talking about and they are willingly sharing this information ."
5,GREAT BOOK----- GREAT IDEAS,GREAT BOOK . THIS BOOK GIVES YOU NEW IDEAS AND WAYS TO MAKE MORE MONEY ON E-BAY.GIVEN BY SOMEONE WHO HAS DONE E-BAY FOR A LING TIME . VERY KNOLEDGEABLE .I THINK THIS BOOK WILL INDEED HELP ME IN MANY WAYS.
3,Not finished yet but had to put my voice out there.,"I'm only about 70% through with this novel and I am listening to it on CD. I really liked the beginning and the concept is really cool. Nance has a good eye for subtleties and paints a vivid picture.But as I get deeper into the story I'm just having a hard time buying that this would ever happen. Sure, I do beleive a lot of people would tap into his story, but a billion people? And the things he writes a often pretty absurd if you ask me. I'm not sure if he would say these things even if he knew people weren't even going to be reading it.But I should say I'm going to finish it, so that's what matters. I just felt like I should tell someone."
4,Awesome,"First John Nance book I've read. Incredibly moving and powerful thoughts coming from a man with only a few days to live. And to those reviewers who can't seem to get past the implausability, you need to know that this book isn't about a man trapped in space, it's about a man trapped in a life that is suffocating him in the same way the air in his doomed ship will, only more slowly. He could be locked in freezer in the basement or trapped in an abandoned mine and the finality of his life would not be different. Forget the space-ship and read this book people. It's not Dianetics or the Bible, but we could all learn from the self-introspection and self-honesty that Kip pours forth in spades. Dad's will not get through this without some tears . . ."
2,"clever plot, didactic, clumsy dialogue","The plot is a clever idea but the right wing political rant, advocacy for privatizingspace flight, hate for bureaucrats,disgust with government in general,repeated over and over,detracts to the point of making the novel far less thanthe plot idea deserves. It is an adventure story buried under sentimentalized melodrama and politicaldidactic cant."
4,almost perfect,"I can't quite give it 5 stars because the author lets alot of what seem to be his sexist and radical right tendencies really show through (for no reason I might add). Nonetheless, in terms of pure plot, this is one of the best thrillers I have ever read. Definitely nail-biting, on the edge of your seat action. Will be next to impossible to put down; I read it in one marathon session."
3,Could have been better,"This book focuses on a good and interesting topic, but just gets to be a little to dramatic and unrealistic as it goes on. The action sequences were pretty good. I thought the ending (the very last chapter) was a little bit too corny, but that might just be me."
1,Too ellipitical,"I just can't quite close the improbable gap that a novice (even if he had some engineering skill and a small amount of flight experience) could repair, fly and land a sophisticated space ship, while at the same time experiencing a personal epiphany that would transform the world. There were just too many miracles for me to swallow."
2,Yawn,"Interesting idea, but major flaws in execution and immature writing. The author can't keep his own voice out of his character's mouths, and his apparent conservative bias rudely interrupts the action with arbitrary pot-shots at such obvious wingnut talk radio targets as ""liberals,"" Jimmy Carter, O.J., and a thinly-disguised Ted Kennedy...*yawwwn*. The climax is ludicrous. This reads like a treatment for a lame made-for-TV potboiler."
5,That was ME in that shuttle!,"Many of us have dreamed of a once in a lifetime opportunity to do something that a rare few get to do. Orbiting the Earth in a shuttle would be high on my list. Well, thanks to John J. Nance, now I have done it! From page one you will find yourself reading faster and faster, until, by the end, you'll be out of breath. If you're a sci-fi fan, or a dreamer, like me, this is a must read."
4,I was surprised I liked it.,The basis of the book does not seem like it would hold your attention but it was captivating and interesting.
2,very disappointing,"The idea behind this book is interesting but the author's decision to have the maincharacter write his memoirs instead of trying to save himself is boringand unbelievable. I've enjoyed some of Nance's other books but unfortunately, thisone was very disappointing."
2,Corny page-turner,Kind of ridiculous to say the least. Admittedly a page turner but very predictable. The best thing about the whole story is the moral. Honesty with yourselves and others is the best policy.
5,Projectile point researdh,Excellent book. I have used it for both research and education. It is one of the basic books in my library.
4,Stone Age Spear and Arrow Points of the Midcontinental and Eastern United States,"An excellent reference book. The only thing that kept me from rating it a five star was one of my pet peeves. The first time you use a technical term, define it. Do not assume that your reader knows a corner point from a side point."
1,Poorly made product,"Purchased this product for parties and camping. Once it arrived I wanted to set it up and make sure all parts were included. One of the poles was bent making it difficult to attach, the pieces are suppose to snap together but the lockings were off so some of the poles did not lock secure. One of the plastic 'Y' fittings broke and the tent itself had a rip in it. I was disappointed at the quality of the product and returned it immediately."
2,"Recylcled, soft-core 'porn'... exciting if you're 13","Well I went against the 'recommendations' I read on this video, and it seems I should have heeded their warnings; this one was a bust. The contents are the same used on several other Peach DVD's, which is really lame, in my opinion. The subdued content would barely be tolerable when viewed (or purchased!) for the first time, nonetheless subsequent times.There is little choice in content, and as far as the 'multiple angles' portion of the dvd go, they are certainly in the minority. Whereas, the vast majority of it is just bland, fluffy, SLOW-moving super softcore scenes. The sexuality is purely implied, and if you're looking for any real 'action' (be it even a girl touching herself, or, *gasp* lesbian scenes), don't look to this video... or you will be terribly disappointed.Save your money, this one's not worth $5."
1,Pure Garbage,"Unlike me do not waste your money. You'll see more skin watching the Discovery Channel. I made the mistake of getting two ""PEACH"" DVD's This one and Breast,Butts and Budapest? (another bomb). If you do decide to waste your hard earned cash, don't say you were'nt warned."
1,Too bad no neg numbers to rate this,"Save you money. It is a complete bore. I have seen lame porns before but this is pathetic. This is as soft of porn I have ever seen, if you can call it porn. you would be better off going to a strip bar and get the same show and more of a thrill than you would with this dvd. Horrible"
1,no good,"do not waste your time ordering this video. yes, the girls are nice and multi angles are good but it's just a big tease. not worth the money at all."
3,aint all that,its ok nice looking women alrite. but its not worth it. just get yo self somethin else.
3,A Downhill Slide,"In the beginning chapter, it does an fine job describing the Scopes Trial and provides good facts and accounts of what happened.The second chapter also isn't bad, but pertains to post-trial occurrences (Brady, mainly).After the second chapter, the book just slips into a void. It starts discussing 'evolutionary finds' that were present at the time of the Scopes trial. It discounts each of these finds, and although the information was interesting to read, it was off-subject and highly critical of evolutionists. The last chapter, very short, was just a few pages packed with biblical phrases which let the authors' disposition towards creationism shine through.Overall, it is not horribly bad or horribly good. The portion of The Great Trials: The Watershed Decasde in America's Courtrooms and the book Summer For The Gods were both very good accounts of the trial (Summer... was more in-depth [expected since that was the book's only topic :P)"
1,A fascinating subject receives a debilitating treatment,"Simply put, Mr. Smith's writing gets in the way of the subject about which he writes. This is a great 400-page book. Unfortunately, it's 623 pages long. Mr. Smith never takes one word if he can say it in ten. Were he one of the broadcasters about whom he writes, he would be described as ""being in love with the sound of his own voice.""And it's such a shame, because this is a worthwhile topic. I climbed into the book hoping for a great deal, but what I got was a great deal less than that. Wordiness killed this book.Smith might say that ""One man's wordiness is another man's poetry,"" but I would say the man for whom wordiness is ""poetry"" is not yet fit to write."
4,Worth the heavy lifting,"This is not light reading, not at all. But it's worth it if baseball is in your blood, and if its announcers are perhaps even more vital to the game's greatness than the players are. As another reviewer said, the author says needlessly unkind things about certain broadcasters, particularly mentioning their drinking habbits. So what? Unless a guy drinks himself out of a job, (which has happened,) announcers have as much right to booze as players or any other working man. Other than that, the book is filled with great portraits of announcers who are forgotten, though they shouldn't be. Lastly, I find it ludicrous that this book is not availablein audio format. It's about announcers-if ever a book needed to be done in audio format, this is the one."
3,Not a shrub!,"They arrived in amazingly excellent shape. My concerns are that they are so small that they should just be marketed for Bonsai. It will take YEARS and YEARS for them to become a shrub. I canceled the order within 2 hours of placing it because I realized that I was paying 7.99 for a tiny plant, and Amazon canceled the order just fine. Hurts went ahead and shipped and charged it to my account. This was frustraiting. I have not contacted Hurts because I did not want the hassle or cost of shipping them back. We'll see if they survive life in zone 5."
5,Almost as good as the real thing,"My wife and I have two kids now, so we can't pop over the border to Toronto the way we used to anymore, so when we want to remember those wicked good time, we pop this dvd in and lose ourselves in the music and the sites...Good stuff!"
4,Loved it!,"I bought this hoping it was a good,clear version so I could enjoy it. I wasn't dissappointed. Who ever cleaned this movie up is to be commended. I had bought a cheaper one(MISTAKE) and you couldn't tell who was the father and who was the daughter. YUK! But this one is absolutely great. I enjoyed it so much. Thanks, Amazon, for giving us choices."
3,Softcover book: The Berkeley's of Barn Elms,"The book is in new condition, with readable print. The price of $10 was attractive.It was advertised as having an ""undescribed binding"". and is actually in a softcover binding.I wish the binding had been described. Had I known that the title of the book would not beon the spine of the book, I'd probably have instead purchased the more expensive, hardcover edition."
1,"R Rated? More like PG 13 at best, Don't bother","If you are looking for an erotic movie with Holly Sampson, don't waste your money on this version. For some reason all nudity and simulated sex was cut out in this $10 DVD. Perhaps Amazon only got the afternoon network TV version. A very unfortunate purchase."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"IN THIS MOVIE THE DRAIGAR AND NORVAGEN ARE FINALY AT PEACE, WHILE KING THORAN PEACEFULLY REIGNS OVER DRAGON WORLD. BUT THAT PEACE IS BROKEN WHEN THE ODAKU TRY TO CONQUER BOTH KINGDOMS, WITH NEW WEAPONS AND ARMOR THEY CAN'T BE BEAT. PRINCE DEV AND PRINCESS KYRA'S ONLY HOPE LIES WITH A YOUNG ODAKU REBEL NAMED GORHAGAR WHO'S SEARCHING FOR THE LONG LOST HEIR TO THE THRONE OF HIS PEOPLE.

THE BABIES ARE SOOOOOOOOO CUUUUUUUTE!!!!!!!I REALY HOPE THEY COME OUT WITH A THIRD MOVIE.I'M DIEING TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT AFTER ONE OF THE SHADOW DRAGONS SNEAKS INTO DRAGON WORLD AND I HOPE THEY BRING BACK XENOZ TOO."
2,Not as good as past acts.,"Lopez is super funny in most of his stand up, but in this one he starts off strong and then he's just trying to be funny towards the end to fill time; might be show of decline in his material.Towards the end of this act he goes beyond making fun of white people, and is totally bitter or something trying to make it all racial. He seems to have forgotten that if it wasn't for Sandra Bullock (white), he wouldn't be up on that stage. Then he gets all crazy saying mexicans do everything for whites (maybe there in his gated community w/Justin Timberlake), and at low hourly rates. True about the $$, but in the end they're making ok money considering the fact they don't get taxed on it...I think we need a new Chicano comedian to rise up and take the spotlight. Maybe one less hypocritical & whitewashed, and that'll make fun of all and all alike."
3,It's the same thing!,I bought two as Christmas presents and also took my family to see him live. DVD was repeat of his December appearance at Nokia. BORING!
1,"George Lopez, Tall Dark & Chicago","I like George Lopez a lot. I watch his comedy shows and enjoyed his tv show while it was on the air. I was however, very disappointed with his new DVD, George Lopez, Tall, Dark and Chicano. I bought two DVD's, one for me and one to give to my godson as a X-Mas gift. After watching my DVD at home I was disappointed as to how much time George Lopez spends on this DVD on the topic of masturbation. I was embarrassed that I had bought this dvd for my godson as a gift and called my godson to apologize for the bad taste in this gift selection. I would not recommend this DVD to anyone and my own DVD has ended in the trash. George Lopez, comedy needs to be funny not gross!!!!!!"
1,Definitely not for kids,"Watched this last night. Love George Lopez's tv show, both the sitcom and sometimes the talk show, but this one left a bad taste in my mouth. Lots of profanity (both in English and Spanish) and he seemed to be too angry to be funny in a lot of places. If you like George, watch the sitcom with your family, and skip this video."
2,George: you need to clean up,"I really like George Lopez and I think he is funny. I feel this new DVD gives an incorrect image of the latino people. Most of us do not say 3 or 4 bad words per sentence and we respect authority, if we do not agree with some laws, we do not irrespect the people who enforce them. We vote them out on elections, even if we do not get them out.I used to share my DVD's with my american friends, but now I am afraid my image of a professional and educated latino will be tarnished.George Lopez is able to make people laugh without bad words and irrespect, he is really a good comedian and he should pursue to make a cleaner show where latinos are seen in their real light.George: Please clean up, there is some of us who want to see real clean comedy."
1,Do not buy this,"I found this album to be highly offensive and racist. Lopez is unnecessarily confrontational and continually emphasizes cultural differences rather than tolerance. I was a big fan of his, but no more. This egocentric diatribe may have revealed his true character."
5,Perfect,The case fits the camera perfectly and is well constructed. I would recommend this case to anyone with a Sony T type camera.
4,okay,"got it and it works. sure they over charge on the shipping but it was like 1 cent 0-o that way I see it, it was 5 bucks for the piece. which is good enough."
3,Shipping was high,Shipping was to high. $9 dollars When it only cost this person 2 dollars to ship. But it was still cheaper than buy from best buy
3,Feels cheap but works fine.,"It's very light weight and feels frail like a buttered biscuit, but it works great and isn't too size-ably intolerable."
5,Works perfectly,"But it should have been provided with the phone, since the built in music player on the KRZR K1 is useless without it.It's hard to separate the performance of this item from the phone it is connected to. The combination of this adapter and the KRZR K1 gives good clean sound through the Sony MDR-G57 headphones I have to hand. So this adapter is doing all that can be expected of it."
3,"A bit of a mixed bag, good Kyllikki","The major works on this disc are the three tracks of Kyllikki (a Kalevala figure), Valse Triste and Finlandia, for piano.Good sampling of piano works, though I miss a little more variety. If you like solo piano discs, this is for you."
2,Thick for small dogs,"These are Ok but my dogs didn't chew on them long. still have a few around the house. They are just to thick, I have two small dogs. once all the red stuff is gone, they are done with the bone. the stick chews are better, and they love the Goof balls. (by this brand)"
5,Great Product,This is a great product. It was very easy to push my car into place when on these dollies. Happy customer.
5,no-brainer,"Large size,sturdy,large steel wheels wont get flat spots,easy assembly [1 nut/wheel] , decent value, nice design, all 4 wheels swivel. look no further-this is the real deal. And Amazon Prime saves you the hassle of driving [gas$ + time + heavy] to a store and lugging them home."
4,Manchuria during Japanese occupation,"As the Japanese army invades 1930's Manchuria, a young girl plays go with strangers in the park as a way to escape the confusion of growing up. Simultaneously, a young Japanese soldier is struggling to reconcile his desire to be an honorable soldier and son with his growing uneasiness with the Japanese campaign. When the Japanese are stationed in the girl's town, the two protagonists meet, and although they never talk other than to arrange go games, a relationship is formed.The novel is written in the first person, with chapters alternating between the girl's perspective and the soldier's, and the language of the translation is crisp and quick. The plot is rooted in the history of the Japanese invasion and the racism between the Japanese and Chinese. It is the tension of this implicit racism combined with the growing awareness of the two characters for each other that I found most compelling about the book."
2,Extremely disappointing,"As a reasonably strong amateur Go player(3 kyu), I found the author's usage, and knowledge, of the game very limited. The gameplay could have been used to give more insight into the two main characters and their relationship, but instead was used only as a plot device to bring them together. I also did not like the girl, who came off as selfish and immature; the Japanese soldier's side of the story was more compelling. Because of the constant switching between perspectives, the narrative becomes a little disjointed, but the major problem is the florid writing. The shockingly brutal ending was suitably dramatic, however, and redeemed the book for me a little. If you like overheated romances set in WWII China, then this isn't a bad read. Everybody else can probably pass."
1,Something Changed!,"I have used this product for years with wonderful success- got rid of mice in my kitchen years ago and they have never come back. So, in spite of the negative comments about them being noisy, I ordered more. Well the reviewers are correct! Something has changed in the manufacturing of the products because they now do make a lot of noise, and you have to unplug them after about 3 minutes. I am so disappointed because I have told so many of my friends about them and have used them all around the house, which has remained rodent free until recently when I heard some gnawing sounds in the den. I ordered some new ones but could not tolerate that loud humming noise. So I moved an old one from a different part of the house to the den, and within 10 minutes the nasty little creature stopped gnawing and left, and has not returned. Please manufacturer- go back to your old way of making these things so we can buy them again! They were a life saver but now they are just a nuisance!"
1,Useless waste of money,"I bought 4 of the Victor Kill & Seal Hygienic Mouse Traps, along with the Victor Sonic Mini PestChaser Ultrasonic Rodent Repellent Both of them absolutely useless. I set up 4 traps and put 2 of the ultrasonics in diffrent parts of my kitchen. I wake up to find the food eaten out of ALL the traps. One was set right next to the ultrasonic repellent,(just to see what would happen). They probably sat under it and had a peanut butter party. laughing the whole time!"
4,It worked,"I created a rat problem for myself when I hung a bird feeder outside my house. Within about six weeks my walls had become infested with rats. I could hear them squeaking behind the stove and in the walls. (My cat, ever fair and generous, determined to pay me back for all the canned food with a dead rat every few days.) I got rid of the bird feeder and cleaned up the fallen bird seed, but the rats stuck around. So I went to the hardware store last week and bought the 2-pack Sonic PestChaser. Since then, I've neither seen nor heard a rat. It's true that you can hear an electrical buzz sound from the units, so I've deducted a star for that (although it doesn't bother me or my cat). For the past few days I've unplugged the units during the day and they've still been effective."
3,Time will tell,"Woke up to a mouse in the house on a cold cold day. Jumped on Amazon.com and ordered the 2 pack and shipped it next day. I plugged them in ASAP and havent seen the mouse since. I do have to say the 2 that I have plugged into my wall ARE NOT INAUDIBLE to humans. I can hear them just ifne, and on the other side of the room. Does that mean it isnt working properly??My mouse so far has been a one time event, Im hoping these do the trick but I think right now, its too soon to tell"
1,Sound I can hear,"There is a buzzing sound that humans can hear, even though I'm sure that's not the sound that is supposed to scare the mice away. Still annoying!"
1,Not effective!,This product did not work. The rodents are still around. I can not recommend. To me this was a total waste of money.
1,"Useless , Worthless a piece of Rubbish","I purchased the victor three pack from lowe's hoping to deter mice from entering my house.These pest chasers were absolutely worthless had no effect on the mice. I wish Victor wouldgive a money back guarantee, I guest if they did to many people would want their money backand may be victor would stop making this nonsense."
3,Sonic Pest Chaser,Just uncertain of the effectiveness of product? Have some evidence of mice but may have decreased -- but can not be sure.
1,"faulty,did not work had to get another",I ordered a mallory e-spark and supposide matching coil. I had a mechanic set up the electronic egnition who does alot of work for me. It would not work so we sorced one locally and it work perfectly. The coil was supposed to be correct and matching to the electronic egnition however the literature in the box said not fit for electronic egnition. The whole process a waste of my money and time
3,"Not as good as his first ""Latin Album""","A sequel to his popular ""The Latin Album"" (1964), ""The Second Latin Album"" again features Trini Lopez performing almost in entirely in Spanish. Unfortunately, this collection isn't as solid as his first Spanish disc. The song selection is uneven, with fine standards like ""Amor"" and ""Solamente Una Vez"" placed alongside the goofy ""Trini Dice Te Amo"" and a completely silly Spanish-language version of ""Davy Crockett."" Lopez's energetic vocals and exciting guitar work can make up for a lot of shortcomings, but not all. One nagging question not related to the music: Collectables has issued both ""Latin"" collections on two separate discs -- as neither disc runs more than 30 minutes and no bonus tracks are featured, why not save consumers money and put both albums on one disc, as the company has done with its Vikki Carr reissues?"
1,Very disappointed,"After reading the entire set of instructions, I discovered that this product comes with a warning, due to California Prop.# 65:""WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling.""Well, how about that?? Have thrown this product away!!"
4,Useful and beautiful,"Been wanting one of these for a while, so I ordered this one. Good service, good product, good price. Only bring it out for parties, but it is useful and beautiful to have around."
4,Its the best in gameplay.,"1.- PES 2007 is bettet than Fifa in Gameplay2.- PES does have the official number and letter designs of the licensed team3.- PES players are not mechanical and slow as the Fifa players.4.- Fifa has a better career mode, PES is very simple and has less decision making.5.- Fifa has a bit better graphics, both are good thou.6.- They both lack more national teams.7.- Menu interaction easier on PES, unlike FIFA you don't get asked if you wanna save or not in every window.I like gameplay over everything. So I like this one better."
1,wrong system,"i thought i was getting an xbox 360 version, and received a psp version, maybe amazon should do a better job of posting this, or the seller mis at fault. i dunno, but i am stuck with a game i cannot even play"
3,not what I ordered,"This was listed as a left handed mandolin. I bought it for this reason. After receiving it, I was called away due to a family emergency, and the return date occured while I was at a family funeral. Missing the return was not the company or Amazon's fault, but when you get an instrument that isn't set up, I think you could extend the reurn time. Especially if it is not what you ordered. All in all it's a nice RIGHT handed mando, made by Washburn. Sound is not the best, but it just needs alot of playing to sweeten up."
2,Really thin,they are really thin but i like that there are no harsh chemicals. you have use like 2 OR 3 at a time . no wonder the price is so low
4,Washing is best though,"Although washing is the best option for the babies (and I normally do so when daughter poops) maybe this is the best wipe for babies, with least rashes and chemicals. Other than the quality of the material, the size is just nice- not too big or too small. No need to waste paper."
4,So soft,I love these soft wipes. They feel like they could rip and have once. I've been through many packs and for it to only rip once is not bad. Very soft and smell nice.
4,Safe for my baby,I've been a loyal buyer of Seventh Generation. I like this cause it feels smoother on the skin. It has a retaining moisture so I don't have to worry about it drying up even before I haven't used it yet. No diaper rash on my baby's skin whatsoever. Perfectly safe for my baby!
5,These are great,We love these. They are very gentle on my baby's skin and I like that they are a more natural alternative.
2,"Used to Like it, but not Anymore","I used to like these, but between the cost of these being much more than other wipes and the terrible smell they emit, I really don't like these anymore."
1,May be green but not a quality product,"I bought these wipes because like every other mom I'm trying to be cost conscious. It was a good price for the number of wipes. However, the wipes are very flimsy. I could use 1 or 2 wipes with the Huggies or Pampers wipes I need 3-4 of these wipes. I would not recommend these nor would I buy it again."
4,"Good ""All Natural"" Wipe","We started using these wipes on my daughter about 2 months ago when she was battling a very nasty diaper rash. After doing much research and realizing that the majority of the baby wipes on the market contain bleach, amongst other chemicals, I decided to make the switch to a ""free and clear"" type of wipe. I found these and have to say that the price is unbeatable. When you compare price per wipe, these are nearly the same as every other wipe out there (even less than some) - so why not choose the more natural option? We have had good success with these, but I am giving 4 rather than 5 stars because they do seem to be a little bit on the dry side compared with the other name brand wipes (Huggies, Pampers, etc.) but they get the job done!"
5,Great wipes,We really like these wipes. Nice knowing that they are a little better for us and the environment. Decent thickness and extremely soft.
5,The Best Baby Wipes,I love these wipes and keep re-ordering them. They arepreservative free and contain no bleach or harmful additives.Purchasing them from Amazon is an added plus because the pricecannot be beat.
5,Love them,These are the only wipes I have used with my baby and I have been very happy with them. I order the case of refills as are much cheaper than buying in stores and they fit in the wipe warmer well. They do have a different odor compared to others but this is due to no added perfumes/chemicals and once I got used to it I don't notice any more. Love Seventh Generation products as are good for us and environment.
3,Too Dry - Small and Bad dispenser,"The worst part is they are dry and I have tried both the dispenser box and the refill and both weren't that impressive. I like the natural touch, but would suggest Earth's Best over these."
3,Seventh Generation Baby Wipes,"We bought two boxes of these without having tried them first. They are pretty good wipes, but they seem to get dry much quicker then other wipes, which results in us having to use more or sometimes even wet the wipes with water. My child has very senstive skin, which is why we decided to try them. And, I've alway been happy with Seventh Generation brand."
2,Wasn't there 80 wipes per each package?,That's what I saw when I ordered!Amazon advertised there are 80 counts but I got 70 counts and it's($5.00 per 100 wipes)much more expensive than the refill ones($4.68 per 100 wipes) I don't know why Amazon did such a stupid thing!
2,Not quite cutting it,"I recently switched from this product to Pampers Sensitive wipes because these wipes aren't that effective. The main reason is that they aren't that wet to begin with, and what little moisture (wiping power) they have in the beginning quickly dries up after a few days."
2,thin and diaper rash,"My husband bought these because they were cheaper and had great reviews and were good for the environment. However, I quickly went back to using the pampers sensitive wipes when my baby started getting diaper rash. The wipes are thin and just seem a little harsh for such sensitive skin."
2,"Work ok (not great), but are stinky!","I had really wanted to like these wipes, but the smell is so horrid! I've used other unscented wipes that smelled like nothing, but not these! Mine smelled like they've already been used as soon as I open the package...at first I kept thinking that something was wrong with each individual pack, but each new one opened smelled the same. I also find that because they're not as wet, I have to use more wipes to get the same cleaning power. So not worth it."
2,Smell so bad!,"These are NOT unscented, they smell so gross! It kind of makes me gag when I put it to my nose, not exaggerating. Ugh, so disappointed.** I did end up contacting the company re: these wipes and they were very friendly and helpful. They took down the info from the box so they could see if this was a bad batch, and they sent me a refund with a couple of coupons. I haven't tried the wipes again so I am not sure if they were just a bad batch."
5,A Safe and Effective Product,They don't smell overly perfumey and they clean well without being abrasive. I like them and got a great price at Amazon.
4,"Good wipes, earth friendly...but I went back to Pampers.","These wipes are good, they do a decent job, but I initially bought them because they are made by Seventh Generation and I like that they are earth friendly. I use Seventh Generation diapers and think those are great! Unfortunately, in regard to the wipes, I went back to using Pampers Thick wipes because I felt like these were a little too thin."
3,Okay,"I appreciate that these wipes are much more sensitive for my little guy who's prone to rashes, but other reviewers are right when they say these items have a funky smell to them. In my opinion, Earth's Best wipes are just as healthy and ecofriendly and they don't make me gag when I open the package, so I'll be using EB from now on."
3,"work, but smell funny","The wipes work great, but the have a strange odor. Our baby's room smelled bad and we finally discovered the wipes were the cause. Probably won't buy again."
2,Love their diapers but these wipes are thin and really stink!,"I usually use Huggies (which are thick and awesome) or Costco wipes but decided to try a greener wipe that is easier to travel with. I noticed that these wipes are considerably thinner than the Huggies and Costco wipes hence they feel softer. However, since they are thinner I've noticed that I need to use more wipes for number 2 clean up now. Also the odor is horrendous! It makes number 2 clean up smell worse and I want to gag everytime. I've tried these wipes in the past but I don't remember the horrible smell and I really regret buying this big pack of wipes. I would stay away from these wipes for a while until they reformulate."
3,Thicker would be better,"I love the concept of no chemicals on the wipes. However, they are a bit thin compared to Huggies etc. You'll need at least two for messes."
1,Unscented Wipes have a Bad Smell,"I thought I'd start to become more ""green"" with the baby items, however, these wipes are smelly. They are not scented, but the natural scent is really bad. I wouldn't recommend this product."
3,"Okay, but Earth's best is better","I bought a case of these wipes and the popular Earth's Best.Earth's Best:Very little smellMoist, but not too wet (drier then wet ones if you are familiar with that brand that has alcohol in it.)More Expensive then 7th gen7th Gen:They SMELL. I can't stand their smell. These are not scent free.Dry, which makes them worse at cleaning up after our new born.Cheaper then EarthsOur new born doesn't have rash problems with either brand.I would recommend Earth's best if you can afford the additional cost."
3,Disapointed with new decreased quantities per package,"I like this product and oredered a subscription. It was a little more expensive than the leading brands, but I didn't mind paying a slight premium for the environment friendly factor. But now the company significantly downsized the packaging from 80 count down to 70 count per pack. On a 12 pack that's 120 less sheets. In other words, the previous 12 pack became a 10.5 pack, with no decrease in pricepoint. I cancelled my subscription because a small premium for environment is one thing, but a ripoff of the captive audience is quite another."
4,Great wipes but be aware that they lowered the count from 80 to 70 and made them smaller,We've been buying these wipes in bulk from Amazon for over a year and absolutely love them! We are disappointed that they just made the wipes about .5 inches smaller and decreased the count per pack from 80 to 70. So now your losing a pack and a half per 12 pack. Oh and the price of course didn't decrease. Also we've never had any issues with them being dry like a couple of previous commenters.
3,Stinky!,"I didn't buy these on Amazon but at ToysRUs (for much more money), but I had to come on here and review them because they SMELL.I bought them for the ingredients because the chemicals they put in baby wipes are atrocious, but these stink so bad I'm going to have trouble going through all of them. They smell almost like citrus, but it's a highly processed chemical-like smell. I can't find anything on the ingredient list that would make it smell like this.I'm going to try to put some lavender essential oil on these to see if it makes them smell better, hopefully it will work!"
5,Nice and Natural,This was a good wipe and we had very little problem with diaper rash. I got scared by reading the ingredient list of most other wipes. I don't want to use a bunch of chemicals on my daughter. This was a nice alternative.
5,great for sensitive babies,"my baby had the worst diaper rash, I change the baby wipes and no more rash"
4,Better than the others,"I buy these all the time- I have them on auto delivery-I think these wipes can stand up to the best, and what's better is they are all natural.I think we put enough into and onto our children's bodies that their wipes should be the exception!I will never go back!"
4,Good,"If I need to use disposable products, I want to use something that is kinder to the environment. These baby wipes do it. They also work great and are strong. I like that they don't have any fragance. I wish they were a little larger, but their size is still good."
5,Best wipes on the market,These work great alone or in a wipes warmer. I am on my second child using these wipes and have had no diaper rash with either child. I highly recommend these wipes to everyone.
5,Love Them!,I love these wipes (as well as the diapers). I like that I am helping my daughter by not giving her any chemicals in the wipes. Would recommend them to anyone.
4,"Seventh Generation Baby Wipes Refills, Chlorine Free and Unscented, 80-Count Packs (Pack of 12) (960 Wipes)",These perform just aswell as their chemically altered cousins
2,Seventh Generation Baby Wipes,"I bought these baby wipes because of its natural ingredients and safety for a baby. However, I was very disappointed with the wipes. The wipes are very thin and I don't think that they are worth the money.I gave it two stars because of natural ingredients. So far, the only wipes that I found that are thick and cloth like are Huggies brand. Too bad the Seventh Generation wipes didn't work out."
5,Great thickness!,"Very good wipes that are more ""baby friendly"". They are great thickness wise and I would definitely purchase again."
2,Not that great,"We ran out of our usual Earths Best wipes, so I grabbed a package of these, and now I remember why I didn't like them the first time. They do seem much drier, and therefore, not as smooth on my baby's skin. Then they dry out way faster if you forget to seal the tub/package they are in. They are a bit thinner and smaller in size than Earths Best. The first time I tried them, maybe 15 months ago, I do remember the smell bothering me, but this time not so much. Maybe they changed the formula a bit?"
2,These wipes smell awful!,I dont know how the other reviewers are saying that these wipes dont have a fragrance. they definitely do-and it is not good! I'm all about chlorine free and am going to have to search for another brand.
2,Disappointed,I was really disappointed with these baby wipes. These wipes are advertised as odorless but the ones that I got have a really awful smell. They are also so thin. I need to fold these in half to prevent poop from leaking through the cloth and on to my hand. Total disappointment especially from the good reviews it has.
4,"Good product for newborns, cheaper option at Target","I felt good using these on my newborn, since they're chlorine/additive free and I'm a fan of Seventh Generation. But now that our guy is quite a bit older, I checked out buying bulk wipes at Target & they're less than half the price. Target price: $11.19 for 704 wipes (unscented/hypoallergenic real cotton cloth wipes). The 7th generation wipes are a slightly rougher and dryer wipe due to not using all the additives & lotions that other brands use."
2,Disappointed,"Bought these off the bat to use with my daughter since we wanted to be as chemical-free as possible. After finishing the wipes the hospital sent us home with (heavily scented, not organic) we switched to these wipes. The first pack we had was a little travel pack of wipes - 50 maybe? We never even made it through the whole pack because my daughter got a rash from them!!! Switched to a different wipe and the rash went away. Have no idea what about these wipes irritated her so much, but they didn't work for us at all. I also didn't prefer their thickness, texture or smell. Their ""unscented"" smell sure isn't pleasant... if they had otherwise worked for us, I probably would have added a drop or two of essential oils to make them smell better."
2,work well but has weird smell,"Ordered these awhile ago, took forever to use them all. I wanted a unscented baby wipe and these have a scent. A scent that Im not fond of at all. I will not order again."
2,Not Impressed,"I love Seventh Generation products and was looking forward to trying these but will not be purchasing them again. I think they would be great for cleaning up general messes but aren't the best for diapers.What I like: I like the brand, the smell, ingredientsWhat I don't like: The size... very small wipes, they also feel ""slippery"" and don't hold poop very well. The first few times I used these wipes for diaper changes I ended up getting my hands messy (which never happened with the other brand) and even had some poop flick off the wipe. I'm getting more careful with it but going through a lot more wipes than I used to."
2,Won't be buying these again.,"I wanted a wipe for my daughter that had no chemicals and was safe/environmentally friendly and was pleased when I found these because they were the same price per wipe as regular Pampers or Huggies wipes. So they were cost effective too. But I was disappointed when I received them. They're smaller than most other brand wipes, so I end up using 2 of them when I'd only be using one of the regular size ones. While I was waiting for them to be delivered I found the unscented/free/clear wipes from Target which are about a penny each and much larger. I'll be using those from now on."
3,Not as good as Earth's Best,These wipes are okay overall but with only two issues: kind of dry and have a funky smell. That is why I would prefer Earth's Best over these wipes.
3,diaper rash,"I really dont get it.. I started using these wipes after buying the pack of 12 and my baby developed diaper rash. She rarely got diaper rash before, so I dont get why this wipe would give it to her. When I stopped using this wipe and used a different brand her rash went away.. Plus I dislike the smell these wipes have. Granted they claim to be unscented, but there is a strange smell to them. Now I am stuck with 900 wipes and I am out $35 bucks. I would recommend trying them out before buying a massive amount of them like I did.. BIG MISTAkE on my part."
2,Sometimes change isn't for the better,"A couple months ago we noticed that the wipes we were getting through our subscribe and save were in different packaging, smaller, fewer and possibly drier. We have since switched to ordering Natural Value Baby Wipes through our local COOP (bulk with a discount). The math works out to a little cheaper than the 7th Gen and the wipes are larger and have just the right amount of all natural wipe soap for either regular use or use from our wipe warmer. (For those who care, the soap in the wipes in the natural value brand is more natural than any other ""natural"" wipe--including 7th Gen--as far as we could tell). As of our switch we didn't see any good bulk deals on Amazon, but since 7th Gen made their strange changes, now might be the time for a Natural Value supplier to take advantage of the opportunity! We do still use 7th Gen's DIAPERS. Still haven't found anything that can beat them--especially on the subscribe and save deal..."
2,They changed! For the worst.....too dry now... :(,We have been using these wipes forever and used to love them! Recently the packaging has changed and they now have LESS wipes and they are SO DRY! We used to love these. There is hardly any moisture now. I dont know what has happened to these but I do know that if they dont change soon we are on the hunt for different ones. Such a bummer......
2,Low expectation for this 7th Generation Wipes,"1) The dimension of the wipe is too small , and too thin. It is not adequate for the job.2) The wipe is supposed to be ""unscented"" , but it has a smell that my wife doesn't like.3) I am going back to Kirkland wipes."
1,small and thin,my husband and i both dislike these wipes. they're too small and thin. i always end up using more than the previous brand we'd tried (a store brand hypoallergenic one)
3,Sevent Generation Wipes,I like that this product is chlorine free and unscented as I do not like those chemicals on my baby but this wipe is VERY thin.
4,"Great wipes, but they changed the ingrediants??","These wipes seem to be the best ""natural"" ones that I have found. When it comes to natural/organic baby wipes choices are VERY limited. I started using the Seventh Generation wipes when the second ingrediant was Aloe, I must say they were much better then. Seventh Generation has now changed the order of their ingrediants and the wipes have a completely different feel to them. They seem more soapy and just not as soft. I just don't understand why they made this switch???I made the switch to Seventh Generation wipes after my son would get bleeding rashes from Pampers, Hugggies and any of the like. Seventh Generation baby wipes have very few mild natrual ingrediants and I felt good about not putting all those additives and preservatives that other wipes contain on my son. Out of all of the natural choices (about 3 different kinds) these seem to be the best and they have a fair price."
3,ok but not moist enough,I use these wipes because my daughter was reacting badly to commercial wipes. She tolerates these so I will continue to use them but they are very thin and not nearly moist enough to get all the poop off without using many more wipes. I hope to find an alternative.
1,Expensive and Moldy,Became moldy within a month.Glad I only bought one pack because these are way too expensive for being such a poor product.
2,"Disappointed by the ""new and improved"" wipes","For 9 months, we loved Seventh Generation Free & Clear Baby Wipes. My son did not get diaper rash and the wipes were the perfect consistency between soft and moist. In my latest order, the package touted a new and improved wipe that was softer, etc. We found quite the opposite with the wipe being too wet and too hard. My son then started getting diaper rash so we had to stop using the wipe. I am really hoping they either go back to their old formula or tweak the new one. Until that happens, I have sadly stopped using the Seventh Generation wipes."
3,too dry,i bought a huge pack of these wipes. they are nice and thin but need a little more juice to them. when baby has some crusted poop you really have to scrub hard with these wipes to get it off due to the lack of moisture in the wipes. just tried the huggies natural care ones which are a lot better in my opinion.
5,Great for sensitive skin,My daughter has very sensitive skin and the regular and even some of the sensitive skin wipes make her break out. These wipes have worked well and not caused any skin issues.
2,Smells Bad.,"The quality of the wipe is good. It is moist and has good strength.But being unscented, I expected it to not smell of anything at all.As it turns out, the wipes smell quite bad. Its not terrible... but definitely not pleasant and I would not put it in a bathroom where guests would use it."
3,"Not the best, but they'll do...","The package size makes them very convenient for carrying in my diaper bag or purse. The re-sealable sticker actually sticks, which is a plus! The wipes themselves are a little on the flimsy side, in my opinion; they were fine for wet diaper changes, but poopy diapers required using a few more than usual. I will buy them again based on convenience and price; also, my daughters both have really sensitive skin, and I feel like these wipes were really gentle for them."
5,"Safest, high quality wipes","An excellent wipe if you want to avoid propylene glycol, fragrances, and other harsh irritants in commercial baby wipes, even those marked as ""sensitive."" Amazon price is excellent, especially if buying by the case."
5,Great wipes!,I started using these wipes because my daughter had really bad diaper rashes from the other wipes. She hasn't had a diaper rash since I switched. My pediatrician also use this on her kids.It's expensive but isn't your baby worth it???
1,NOT very environmentally friendly!,"I'm so sorry to say that these wipes are very disappointing...first of all, the wipes arrived in a pack of 12 plastic containers (whatever happened to the environmentally friendly packaging???). The containers themselves are terrible - I cut my finger on an edge while trying to feed the wipes through the pop-up top. The wipes are small and thin, and they don't feed through the top very well, so I had to keep digging for each wipe (not very convenient when you're in the middle of changing a diaper!) I really wanted to like these wipes, but unfortunately I'm going back to using Huggies and Pampers ones."
3,Works fine - over priced,"With 3 kids still in diapers, we go through a lot of wipes. These works quite well. I'd rate it higher but I think Seventh Generation and other 'natural' consumer product makers are ripping off consumers. Of the online retailers, Amazon seems to have the best prices if you use subscribe and save."
4,Feel-good wipes for parent and baby,"Expensive but it gives you a small feeling of saving the environment. You may be throwing them away like you would any other wipes, but at the same time, you're supporting an environmentally friendly company. I like that they are unscented, so I don't have to think of the chemicals I'm leaving on my baby's butt. They don't leave an oily film, nor do they dry out her skin. The wipes could be a little thicker, then again, it would just be more to throw."
3,So many better wipes out there,"I have bought Seventh Generation wipes as well as many other chlorine free unscented wipes, but these just weren't that great. These were rather dry causing me to go through a lot more of them to do the job and it still wasn't pleasant for my little one. This is one I will not be purchasing again."
3,"Good Amazon Price, No chlorine, But...","I try to buy as many earth friendly, child friendly products as I can, from lotions to dish detergent, soaps, food, etc. I like the idea of these wipes, but these just don't compare to a huggies or even walmart's parents choice wipes....these have no pattern/ridges to wipe away a mess and they don't remove the smell of a messy diaper either. After wiping with these, my daughter's bottom still smells of dirty diaper. Wish they worked better!"
3,A little thin & dry,"I'd say this is an average wipe, and have rated as such. I was used to using the Pampers sensitive wipes, and these are considerably thinner and have less moisture to clean smoothly. Overall, I've used worse wipes, but I don't think I'll be purchasing again. I think I'll stick with the plush Pampers wipes-- I really don't want to get a rip in the thin wipe when I'm cleaning up!"
2,Not Worth It,"I am laughing hysterically from reading the other reviews which are referriing to the awful smell these wipes contain. I know EXACTLY what you mean and cannot understand why there were so many positive reviews and they do not mention this or, even stranger, they actually state these are unscented - definitely not true. Perhaps it is because I switched from Huggies Natural Care, which I liked very much, and they did not have a bad odor. I just wanted to try something more eco-friendly and cost effective, but 7th Generation's wipes are too thin and too malodorous to make it worth it. I am switching back and will be giving away the rest of this case of wipes I purchased. I would feel bad about selling these to someone else."
3,Work well but they do smell,"These work fine, but they have a sour smell to them. I can definitely smell it, my husband can't really....though I'm not sure if he chooses not to smell it (or acknowledge it) because these are better for the environment than others.The smell is on the wipes, but doesn't leave a smell on my baby girl, so I'm ok with them."
2,These leave the baby way sticky,"While being put forward as more environmentally friendly, we found these wipes to be not up to par. they always seem to leave the baby sticky and not really clean feeling. Will not be buying these again."
3,"They work, and the price is right.","The subscribe and save price is worth it for us, although these are not our first choice. I would rather have an even better ""greener"" wipe completely free of anything synthetic. I don't believe these fit that description, but at least they don't have the worst stuff."
5,FDA where are you?,"I could not believe there was chlorine in my previous wipes. I was using them to clean my little girl's bottom, hands and face! How can they allow that in babies skin products? I'm so glad I discovered these. I think they leave her cleaner too, without all the additives and fragrances."
4,Better for baby; a little more inconvenient for me,"After learning about the potential dangers of the chemicals in other baby wipes, I have switched to these. I feel much better using these (especially on my daughter's hands and face) but I have to say I miss the thickness and durability of the Huggies wipes I used to use. These are not as thick and don't wipe quite as well (especially on those #2 situations) so I usually need to use more wipes to get her clean. But I'm still a convert to Seventh Generation if it protects my children from potentially harmful chemicals.By the way, I still use the Huggies containers to hold the wipes because I found the Seventh Generation containers to be a huge pain to pull wipes from."
5,better product for a little more money,"I have to say I have been pleasantly surprised by these wipes! With a new baby in the house, we went thru several brands of sensitive wipes (Pampers, Huggies, Target generic and Kirtlands). I found these wipes to be stronger and hold their moisture better than any of the other brands we tried. Overall they are a better performing product than any of the other wipes.My only comment is that buyers should not expect the wipes to be as strong as wipes made for older babies or toddler. However, we like them so much we have started using them on our toddler. Though it is a matter of personal opinion (and after becoming more educated on the topic) we feel that the lack of fragrance, synthetic ingredients and a lower impact on the environment is worth the switch."
1,Awful,"These wipes are terrible. They are tiny and thin. I have to use 3X as many as with other wipes. How green is that? Also, they smell AWFUL. Do not buy these."
4,Good product,I have tried several wipes. These are thin but work well. I like that they aren't filled with chemicals especially since my toddler always tries to suck on them! They come out very easily and one-by-one from the packaging which is definitely not true of other wipes.
5,Great wipes!,"I love these wipes because they don't have a overpowering baby powder smell, they are chemical free, easy to get out of the package, convenient for diaper bags, and are pretty inexpensive."
1,These stink!,"My husband and I have carefully selected a lot of ""green"" products for our home and especially for our baby. We were thoroughly disappointed with these wipes. When we opened the package, we couldn't help but cover our noses--they stunk! We thought we would get used to the smell, but it was so vulgar--bordering on worse than the dirty diapers--that we quite using them. Its a shame, because we've liked other Seventh Generation products."
2,Smells so gross!,"While I use Seventh Generation diapers, and applaud their products & the efforts they make for the environment, I cannot stand the way these wipes smell. I seriously want to hurl when I use them. Plus, they are really thin. I don't necessarily need a baby wipe that is perfumed, I would just prefer that it not smell the way these do. I can't even describe what they smell like, but it's gross."
1,Seventh Generation Wipes - Diaper Rash Special,"I bought Seventh Generation baby wipes recently in an attempt to be more environmentally conscious and also to reduce the amount of chemicals that my daughter gets exposed to on a daily basis. I don't have a preferred brand so I thougt I'd give them a shot. My daughter is 16 months old and never had a diaper rash. As soon as I started using 7th Generation Wipes she started getting diaper rashes, one after another. May be those harsh chemicals are useful after all. I'm back to other non-organic brands and my daughter hasn't had a diaper rash since. I would not recommend this product to anybody!!!!"
5,Nice wipes,I was always keen in choosing products for my baby. These baby wipes are an excellent choice. It has this great smell that is not too strong for my baby. I can easily get one wipe with one hand. This is a great deal for me because other wipes are stressful in that several wipes would pop out once you get something from the topmost.
3,good basic wipes,"These are something that buying in mass quantities just makes sense. My son has sensitive skin and these have never caused a reaction of any kind. I like that they are chlorine free and after the subscribe and save discount they are about the same as generic wipes I could get at a big box store.I do recommend buying a hard box of wipes at the store and then using these as refills, the huggies brand seems to make the nicest reusable box and it's easier to access these one handed that way. Just sayin. . ."
1,too thin and too dry,"too thin, small and dry out too fast or not wet enough, did not like huggies or pamper sensitive are better, I had to use 3 or more per cleaning with the other brands I use one most of the time max two."
1,Rash,"My poor son developed a rash with these wipes. I figured this out after he had gotten the rash, and then we discontinued using the wipes for a few days and only used warm damp washcloths and Boudreaux's Butt Paste. The rash cleared right up after this, so we started using the wipes again, thinking it would be fine. Unfortunately, the rash came back. We're going to try other brands. I will be returning my wipes to diapers.com, as this is where I purchased them."
2,Not a very moist moist wipe,"Material is fine, but the wipes are insufficiently moist + are more like dry wipes than wet wipes. Not good enough for baby wipes. We ordered one box of 840, and that'll be it for us. We were hoping to go natural, but will likely go back to Pampers Wipes, which may not be all natural, but are a much more effective as baby wipes - strong, comfortable, good consistency, right amount of moistness.Product needs significant improvement."
2,"Thin, makes for messy clean up","Bought this for the amazing price and loved the more natural product. Unfortunately they are very thin. I end up using at least twice as many wipes per diaper change compared to the costco brand. Also, the thin wipes are harder to control if that makes any sense. They seem to flop around threatening to smear doo doo all over the user."
5,Seventh Generation Baby Wipes,"We use these wipes every day! Other wipes have given our baby a rash, but these have been great and gentle on her skin. I like that they aren't too wet so her skin dries before a new diaper goes on. We buy a box every couple of months!"
2,pretty good,I like it but dont love it. the price was pretty good. but the performance could be a little better. was not damp enough. will probally try it again
4,Does the job,This is a great wipe if you are interested in something natural. I wish the company made them in bigger packages instead of the small ones.
2,not great,"When my daughter was born we started using the Earth's Best wipes, which were great. Recently we ran out and the Earth's best wipes were unavailable so we ordered these instead. When comparing them to the E.B. wipes, I do not like them at all. I do not like the way they smell, E.B. dont have a smell, they are small, and they don't feel soft or seem to clean very well. I am not happy with them and hope that next time the E.B. wipes will be available again."
3,Works fine but smell awful,It says they are unscented but they smell awful. Unscented should be just that. They work just fine but I wont be buying them again as I hate the smell.
4,"We like this, but why 70?","We were not thrilled when they whittled down the contents to 70 wipes. The fact is that we rely on these for the kids and they have not let us down much. But we are using a huggies dispenser as it prevents the wipes from falling in and being a nuisance when short-handed. So there it is.Like, not love."
1,terrible,"Please don't waste your money. I have 3 boys and these are just about the worst wipes that I have tried. Earth's Best are much better. I have to use 5-6 Seventh Gen wipes to get baby's bottom clean and they are not wet enough or large enough. You may as well wet a washcloth and use that! I have been using them to clean up messes around the house-trying to get rid of them so I can go back to Earth's Best. Seventh Gen was on sale, that's why I tried them. They just stink!"
2,Not worth it.,"I LOVE the seventh generation diapers, so I decided to try the wipes. Don't buy these. They are thin and don't wipe very well. You'll end up using way more wipes for a dirty diaper than necessary. The best wipes are the Kirkland baby wipes from Costco. Don't buy the Seventh Generation wipes."
1,The worst!,"I bought these because they are chemical-free and I want to support Seventh Generation's environmental practices. Was I disappointed! First of all you have to use 2 to 3 times as many than, say, Pampers or another leading brand because the wipes are so puny. Second, they don't get rid of the poo smell even after using six or seven. What a waste! I'll keep buying their diapers but there's no way I'm ever buying their wipes again."
2,not wet enough & tears easily....,"these are not good wipes. they are not wet enough to clean ""poopy"" diapers, and they tear very easily. not worth the money."
2,Don't work,"I have always used Costco wipes and liked them. Online I saw these and thought I'd give them a try. I found that it was hard to wipe my kids bum with them because the individual wipe was so small, I ended up using more wipes to get the job done. I do like that the wipes come in a smaller package, to keep in the car, purse etc. I also throught that the wipe didn't wipe up much, the texture of the wipe didn't collect much poop. Anyways, for what my review is worth to someone, I'm going back to Costco wipes."
5,Love them,My daughter is sensitive to many wipes and diapers. I was making my own wipes for her first 12 weeks. These wipes don't bother her at all and now I can spend more time with her instead of cutting up paper towels!
2,Not so great,"Would not buy again! Actually going to give the rest of the packs away. Compared to the usual Huggies Natural Care, these wipes are terrible. They are thinner, smaller, and drier. I basically have to use 2 wipes at a time and then a few more. With the Huggies wipes, I use one at a time and get the job done with fewer."
5,I love these wipes!,"We changed wipes when my daughter had a reaction to her regular diapers. We changed wipes first then diapers and realized it was the diapers that was the problem, but I loved these wipes so much I kept using them. They are gentle on her skin-even on her face. Other wipes have irritated her, but these have never been a problem. They are softer than other brands of wipes also. They may be more expensive, but are worth it!!"
4,Green but linty,"I like these because they are chlorine and perfume free, and they work just fine, but they do leave lint and are thin."
5,Excellent wipes,This is a great product. We try to buy as much organic without all the chemicals and feel this is a safe product for baby skin. Amazon was the cheapest place to purchase and free shipping is great. Amazon shipped them to England (military) for our new grandson!!
3,these wipes fall apart,"These wipes are a great value for the price and I like the idea that they are chlorine free. However, they tend to fall apart on my boy's bottom, leaving pilled-up pieces behind. By bath time, his little bum crack is filled with baby-wipe leftovers. SO I am switching to a different brand."
5,The only wipes I'd use,"Seventh generation are absolutely the best wipes I've tried. I've tried a few other brands of unscented baby wipes and none of them come close to the quality of the 7th generation. These are soft, and durable and don't pill when you use them (one of the other brands always left bits of lint on my daughter's bottom). Ordering them here by the case cost me less than half the retail price in stores, and they arrived within two days."
4,I wouldn't use any other commercial wipe,"We used to make our own wipes, but sadly that grew old after a couple years. Now my child is 3 and we still need to use wipes every now & then and Seventh Generation wipes are the best available for not slathering excessive chemicals & chlorine against my child's skin. There is another company I'm aware of, but their wipes are significantly more expensive! If there is anything that I would like to see improved with this brand of wipes is for them to be just a tad bit thicker (they don't tear, I just like a bit of thickness). Yet we are quite happy with these wipes and continue to buy them."
4,Wish they were thicker,"Good wipe, but they are thin. I wish they were thicker. Sometimes poop sneaks through. But they are good for my toddler so I am fine with it overall."
3,Product has changed!!,I loved these wipes!!!! That was until I recieved my recent subscribe and save shipment. The wipes are smaller and seem to dry out much quicker probably something to do with the ingredients change. I am using even more wipes and there are less wipes in the package making it really expensive. I will be looking for another product as I am now a very unhappy customer.
1,"Irritates the skin, has a weird smell and I am done with this product !","We bought these wipes cause they are environmentally friendly and chlorine free. They certainly are an environmentally safe product but I have my doubts about being alcohol free. It has some stinging effect cause my poor baby would scream everytime I used one of these. Also, they are dryer than competitive brands (earth's best) and so I would end up using twice as much. The wipes also have some distinct (read weird) smell, they certaintly are not frangrance free like they claim. We read some nice reviews about Earth's best chlorine free wipes at diapers.com so I went & bought a refill pack from Babies-R-Us. Guess what, no more screaming baby at diaper change and I need only 2 wipes now where I used 4-5 of the 7th generation. Also, the earths best is truly frangrance free and my little one is comfortable so guess what our next order for wipes will be................."
3,stealth reduction in size and number,Although I have found these wipes successful for both of my kids - it is disconcerting when the manufacturer reduces the size and quantity and keeps the same price. The smaller quantity will actually increase packaging and decrease the environmental benefits associated with buying refills instead of the full dispenser. The reduction in quantity and size equates with an approximate 15% reduction in material for the same price!
2,Didn't like them,"When we started using these, my daughter started getting intense irritation in the diaper area. I am not sure if that is a coincidence, or if it's solely related to the product. Additionally, these wipes are very thin, and we had to use a lot of them when changing my daughter. Also, they have a strange scent. So, this clearly was not our favorite seventh generation product. I have liked their other products in the past, including their diapers."
3,"I really wanted to like these, but . . .","When I first got pregnant with my daughter, I decided to go green all the way, from what I eat, to what I use on my face/body, to what I use in my house. I've been using a lot of green products already, including 7th generation (which I really like), so I figured I'd try the wipes before I buy a case. I am really glad I did. I really don't like the smell and they are too dry to clean up my baby girl's messes (I breastfeed, so there is a lot of that :-) I am searching for other ""natural"" brands, and in the meantime I use cloth with a homemade solution, which is great, but I want to use both for convenience. If anyone has a recommendation, please let me know. Thanks!"
2,Changed for the worse,"Please heed the more recent reviews detailing the recent change in this product. Unfortunately, 7th Gen has ""fixed"" what wasn't broken and now the wipes are drier, thinner, and smaller - too small and thin to keep your hands clean without using extra wipes. My husband agrees that these are terrible. Disappointed that I am stuck with a case of the new wipes. 7th Gen: please bring back the old wipes!"
2,Small,"I picked this brand to switch away from the more harsh and environmentally ""un-friendly"" wipes. I found these to be very small and they did not have the best scent. I expected them to be ""unscented"", however I was not impressed with what I smelled when opening the package.These are more expensive than other wipes, which I was okay with due to the fact that they are chlorine free and better for baby and the environment...but I will not buy them again because they were so small. I found it hard to keep my hand covered when wiping baby's dirty toosh!"
2,Pain in the ...,"Let me preface this review by saying the quality of these wipes is fine and thus the 2 stars. What drives me crazy about these is that they are smaller and although the packaging holds 70 wipes. If you reuse the standard wipes plastic cases like I do. 70 of these wipes barely fills one standard wipes box so here you are struggling to reach the wipes you just filled that are now at the bottom of the box with a dirty diaper and squirming baby! Refill the container with 2 you say?- get this 140 7th Generation wipes still does not fill the standard refill box of 60 wipes. Never again! For the price they should be thicker, larger and fill a standard refill box (which -ahem- reusing these is better for the environment!!) DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE MONEY."
2,Too dry,"I love Seventh Generation products, but unfortunately I think that these wipes fall short. They are awfully dry, I feel like I need to use 5 or 6 to get the job done. It's too bad because I like the fact that they are chlorine-free. I won't be ordering these again."
4,Seems to do the trick,What can you really say about wipes? They seem to do the job they're destined for. I like that they're unscented.
2,Not impressed,My biggest complaint is the smell... ugh. Smells kind of acrid. When you're changing poopy diapers and put off by the smell of the wipes something is wrong. They are not very moist either.
4,Wipes,"Great wipes. Work well and I appreciate that they're not quite as full of chemicals as other wipes (especially since daycare wipes my baby's hands with them and all he does is put them right back in his mouth...). Great price on subscribe&save. My husband doesn't like the smell, but it doesn't bother me."
1,Smell funny and not much liquid,"These are OK, but I am switching to another brand. They have absolutely no fragrance, and when wiped on a dirty bottom, leave a funny smell. They are also stiff and have very little liquid. I recommend Earth's Best Sensitive wipes (the new ones in the purple wrapper). They have a lovely natural shea butter scent and are thick, flexible, and very moist."
1,yucky scent and low quality wipes,"the scent of this wipes is awful, not a good quality wipe. i used to wipe my son with a flannel wipe after using this wipe."
3,Average Wipe At Best,"I really wanted to like these wipes because they are more 'natural' than conventional wipes and are chlorine free. I have previously been using Earth's Best wipes, which I love, but their price increase has made them somewhat unjustifiable to purchase.The Seventh Generation wipes are somewhat on the small side, thin and are not very moist. As other reviewers have noted, there does tend to be somewhat of a strange odor to them as well. I find that it takes two to three times as many Seventh Generation wipes to do the same job as the Earth's Best wipes. That in itself negates the cost savings associated with the Seventh Generation wipes.I would suggest buying a single package of these wipes before committing to the larger multi packs."
3,NOT unscented,"The wipes work well, but they smell terrible. The box claimed they were unscented so I'm really disappointed. I usually buy the Kirkland brand but thought I'd try these because they seem more natural - I think I'll go back to the Kirkland's."
3,Ok wipes,"These are the wipes we ended up using for our son. I like that they don't have harsh chemicals and are affordable. However, they are very thin and I have to use more than I would with a thicker wipe."
2,Wasteful,I splurged from my tight budget believing the product was worth the extra money. I was unfortunately wrong. I liked the idea of the natural product and the thought that it would be a more resourceful product. However the wipes are so small and thin I end up using more than I would normally. They also don't feel like they are made for sensitive skin which I believed the natural wipe would be for. The wipes don't feel all that soft and are on the dry side. I should have tried them before buying a case. Would not reccomend these wipes.
2,Big Bummer,"I am going to join the others who think that the new wipes are less than desirable. I could live with the fact that they are packaging 70 wipes rather than 80, IF the wipes were of good quality. But unfortunately the packaging is not the only thing that has changed. The wipes are indeed smaller and drier. But, for me the real deal killer is the smell-very chemically and pervasive. Do yourself a favor and buy an individual package before committing to a whole case."
2,Go with Earth's Best!,"We bought these when Earth's Best was sold out at the store...big mistake. They smell better but they are not as moist and do not clean pooh as well. These would be great to clean just urine, face, or messy hands however they are also a lot smaller (actual wipe size) then Earth's Best. We switched back as soon as Earth's best was back in stock!"
2,"Chlorine free, but not free of harmful things","I received these wipes at a baby shower and used them simply because I couldn't return them. Although we're using cloth wipes with plain water mostly, I use packaged wipes occasionally and when away from home. Although these say they're unscented, they smell like something I don't like. I can't quite figure out what, but chemical comes to mind. Also, they have Sodium benzoate, which I don't want on my child ever. Just because something is advertised as ""food grade"" doesn't mean it's edible or safe for human use. I'm trying Elements Naturals wipes now and they are so far much better. They have absolutely no scent and clean the poo off well. Also, they don't have as many ingredients that I don't know what they are."
3,Too Thin and Too Small,"The first time I used this product was when I bought the one pack from Target. Previously, I used the Kirkland brand, which I loved, but wanted to switch to something more natural. The one pack that I used could be compared with the Huggies brand- very thick. So I bought a subscription to the refill packs from Amazon, thinking I would get the same thing.The refills are quite different. They're very thin and a lot smaller in size. There's a thick sticker dispenser instead of the thicker plastic cover. I have to use about 10 or more wipes each time, and it's a bit too slippery for me.I cancelled my subscription right away. It's too bad. I really wanted to like it. I guess I have to search some more for the perfect, natural wipe."
5,Baby wipes,The mom to be was very happy with these wipes. She was very excited to see that i bought them for her.
2,Don't like these wipes,Just had a baby and my friend recommended this brand for it's naturalness. However the wipes smell bad and I gag every time I smell them. I am sending them back considering they say they are unscented and do have a scent.
1,Price increases and lowering of count,Twice this item has lowered the amount in each pack and increased the price. All because they have no scent and Chlorine. So less ingedients and higher prices.
3,eh!,"these wipes are ok, they are not very soft. i perfer huggies wipes over these. will never buy them again."
5,Great sensitive wipes,"These wipes worked well on our son with very sensitive skin. They are not the lowest on the toxicity scale (although much lower than huggies, pampers, and kirkland) but for the money and convince they have been our favorite."
3,Thin,I love Seventh Generation products and this one certainly does the job you need it to however I had to use more wipes than I would with a thicker product and therefore ran out sooner. This is a fall back option for me if the thicker brand I buy is not on sale. I buy cruelty free in case you're curious about my brand loyalty and preference.
3,Great but not perfect,"Love that these wipes are free and clear and they don't irritate sensitive baby skin however the scent of them is a little off-putting and they are thin so it takes 3 or more to take care of ""big jobs""."
1,Ouch!!,"For medical reasons (you probably don't want to know, and I'd definitely rather not say), I recently had to switch to wipes rather than toilet paper for a brief period.Started with Wet Ones brand, then used the cheapo brand from CVS. No problems with either. Then we picked up a package of these, and oh boy! They HURT! They feel soft in your hand, but when you use them in the sensitive place that they are meant for, they don't feel very soft at all.I wonder if the babies mentioned in the other 1-star reviews were suffering from plain-old abrasion rather than diaper rash.In any case, I'd strongly urge any parent considering these to test them out on their own bottom before using them on their baby's."
2,Not recommended,"I bought these for the lack of chemicals and extras, but was disappointed in that, like someone else mentioned, the ones in the plastic containers are very dry. We have to wet them to get them to work better. Also, they smell sooo bad. They don't use a fragrance, which isn't a bad thing, but the products they do use in the wipes smell disgusting. I am pregnant so my sense of smell is heightened, but my husband doesn't particularly like the smell either. We won't be buying these again. The Earth's Best wipes smelled better, but we had a lot of trouble getting the wipes to come out. We kept having to rethread the wipes through the lid of the plastic container."
3,"good wipes, terrible dispenser","wipes are great - they are terrific for babies w/ sensitive skin. HATE the packaging, though. by the time you get half way through a box, they stop being pulled in through the top. so to use the 2nd half of every box, you have to take the lid completely off to get the wipes. this is terrible when you have a squirmy toddler or infant on your hands! i think the sheets themselves either need to be longer or folded in a way to make sure they are all able to come up through the top. we are actually so frustrated w/ the packaging that we aren't ordering this product any more!"
3,Switched to Earth's Best,"I've been using 7th Gen for 10 months, but since they reduced the number of wipes from 80 to 70 (and allegedly made them smaller and less moist), I switched to Earth's Best, which I think are just as good. Prior to the change I would have rated 7th Gen wipes 5 stars."
2,Why is this wipe so highly rated?!?,"I use and very much like the Seventh Generation diapers. I purchased these wipes today based on the favorable and high recommendations posted on amazon.com ... and, for the life of me, cannot understand why there are so many 5-star ratings!Yes, this non-chlorinated, low-toxin, environmentally-friendlier wipe earns points for being just that, but, for performance, this wipe feels and works like the equivalent of 3 squares of 1-ply toilet paper. I am willing to think that perhaps I bought a bunk package (I sure hope I did!) because the wipe is so, so small and seems really, really dry ... hard enough to use for clean-up of a wet diaper, I shudder to think how many wipes it would take -- and how messy the process would be -- to clean a bum that had a soiled diaper!I am headed out tomorrow to get something else."
3,Not recommended to use with warmer,"Size is not standard, they are smaller;when using with a diaper warmer you need to open the warmer every time.I'm using them just when going out, the packaging is very practical but definitely I wont recommend them as your regular baby wipe; practically unusable with wipe warmer, they are too thin and small in size."
1,The smell is horrible and the wipes are like sandpaper...,"I thought I would do something nice for the environment and my child, well my child wins! She got a rash, and it got worse, and she cried when I used this wipe - it was to the point where the skin was so raw it would have peeled next, it happened so quickly too! I actually took her to the doctor for the rash to see if we could get a prescription cream to comfort her. I would not recommend nor purchase this product again."
3,Don't try to tear these!,"I wanted to save money and tear these in half like other wipes I've used. It's nearly impossible, they are built like thin (disposable)towels. Sure, they smell good and work fine, but what about reduce, reuse, recycle? If you're thinking about the ""seventh generation,"" these don't really help. Next time I'm going to buy wipes that are cheaper and tear in half."
1,Smells Terrible,"The wipes are very gentle and the texture is smooth and of good quality but they smell horrible, It was so bad had to stop using them becuase my son smelled really bad after using it. I hope this helps."
2,Smells bad,"These wipes should not be advertised as being ""unscented."" They should instead be labeled ""funky,"" ""noxious,"" ""stinky""... I can't even describe the smell accurately, but I will say that they smell disgusting. It's fine if you just use them to wipe baby butts, but in my house, we use them on pretty much everything. Forget about wiping runny noses with these-- no kid is going to want it that close to their nose. This is my only complaint about these wipes. They work perfectly fine otherwise; I just can't get past the smell. Please note that I wasn't expecting a wipe that smells like baby powder or ""baby,"" I just want one that is truly unscented.The smell of these wipes is so offensive to me that I actually took time out of my day to write this review, something I rarely, if ever, do. Maybe my nose is just too sensitive, but even my husband has commented about the smell and he can't smell anything usually."
1,Never dare to buy these,Considered Seventh Genaration Brand and my most incline nature towards Green/Organic products I ordered these instead of my Regular brand wipes.Me and my wife totally disppointed with the outcome. They smells bad whenever you use them.Seventh genaration kind of cheating with the size as no customer really look for the size of a wipe like we do for Diapers and they completely betrayed everyone as they are half in size of any notable Brand Wipes. which makes you use double quantity. Please never buy. I request Amazon.com to add wipe Length and width in this Product Description.
2,TERRIBLE wipes,"These wipes are so DRY!! I have 6 packages left and I just use them to wipe his toys and things- I don't put them anywhere near his backside. First, they are not moist enough to wipe up after a dirty diaper, so you end up wiping the poor child raw and, at the very least, have to add water (not so convenient in a public restroom). Also, they have quite a strong chemical smell, not at all like earth's best, which seem far more emollient and moist. The only advantage over earth's best wipes is that the Seventh Generation packaging is a little better- it is easier to dispense single wipes out of the packaging, whereas you could pull out 8 wipes with the Earth's Best when you are trying to just grab one.There is absolutely NOTHING to recommend these wipes. And on top of it all, they are overpriced!! I would use a store brand over these any day. They are not even organic, what's the point?"
1,Don't waste money buying these wipes!!!!!,"I purchased these wipes recently and can't stand them. They are thin, dry and so small. I use 2 or 3 for the same job that I would usually use 1 of the pampers sensitive wipes. I wanted to throw them out but decide that I could use them after meals for hands and face cleaning instead of paper towels."
3,They've added Sodium Benzoate! Ugh.,"I used to like these. I wasn't pleased with the recent ""pay the same for fewer"" change, but I let them come on subscription anyway. Now I realize they've changed more than just the packaging... They've also changed the ingredients. These now contain sodium benzoate as a preservative, something my son is sensitive to. So, we've got 840 wipes we can't use!! I've got to decide whether to go through the hassle of returning them (and paying return shipping) or just to donate the whole case. And then, of course, I have to track down a new wipe that my son's sensitivities can tolerate. And we're almost out! Ugh. I wish Amazon had alerted us to both product changes, not just the size difference."
5,Satisfied,I am satisfied with the Seventh Generation wipes. They stay moist and do the job by cleaning up the messes.
4,Great Wipes,Never had an issues with these going on 18 months of usage with respect to causing rashes or anything of that nature. The one complaint is most likely our own fault. They do dry out quickly if you leave them open to the atmosphere for any period of time.
1,Unfortunately the worst wipes I've ever used,"I'm a big fan of Seventh Generations and have used their wipes for my first child for years. Having said that I must say that these new wipes (it's a different layout, different smell, feel) are the worst I've ever used.My second child is now 2 and I need about 10 wipes (always, always have to use 2 at a time anyway, otherwise nothing gets done at all!) for one BM, where with other wipes (being with friends with different brands etc) I would only need 2. That for me is a big, big waste of products, energy and money. I wished they never changed their formula!"
2,Not that great,"I purchased these with the hopes they would work great and be ok to put on my son's sensitive skin. Sure, they were chlorine free, but the don't work well at all. They dry out about half way through the pack, and the wipe itself is very small. Like others, I was put off by the smell. They work fine for just wet diaper changes, but dirty ones, I would have to use at least 3-4 wipes to get everything cleaned up.I wouldn't recommend these at all. They are definitely over priced for what they deliver."
3,i like the fact that they're green but...,I'm going to stick with earth's best. They stay much wetter than the seventh generation. I only got these because they were cheap. It's worth it to spend a little more on the earth's best wipes.
2,Hmph...I Wanted to Like These,"I like a thicker wipe so I prefer Huggies. These get the job done; they are lightweight wipes and do not tear when wiping, however, they dry out in our wipe warmer. Otherwise, no issues, just my personal preference to have a thicker wipe."
1,ok product bad package,A company that is focused on environmental issues for seven generations should not be using a number 5 plastic to package their products. It is not recyclable in most cities.They could easy package in a 1 or 2 plastic or a Biodegradable plastic.Also the container is half full why not fill all the way and use less packaging
2,Smell not pleasant to me and too small,"I love the 7th generation diapers - but wouldn't buy the wipes again.They have an odd scent that I find really unpleasant,and they are so small - I feel like I am using more than I would of other wipe brands.Oh well."
1,Seventh Generation Baby Wipes,I used to love these wipes but the company has changed the ingredients and they now contain Polysorbate 20. I recommend Tushies unsented baby wipes.
2,Fluctuating price,"When I first did subscribe and save for these, the price was around 20 then 25 now over 30. Cheaper on other sites now. Serious disappointment amazon."
2,Fine,"These are soft, I did like that. But as I think some other reviewer mentioned the fact that they have no design on them gives you no friction. You don't know how much you need that until you don't have it."
4,Just what I expected,"These wipes were gentle on my newborn, and the package contained enough of them that I didn't have to go out and buy new ones too soon."
2,"Cheap, Cheap","1. Cheap Price (+)2. Smells Weird (-)3. When you pull out one tissue, next one will stay out like dry tissue (-)"
5,Great Wipes!!!,"My baby was breaking out in hives and we could not figure out why. After months of eliminating certain things, we switched him to Seventh Generation baby wipes and diapers and his hives went away! ALL OTHER wipes and diapers cause him to break out in hives. These are a little more pricey than some brands but they are well worth every penny! If you have a child with very sensitive skin you should definitely give these a try!!!"
2,NOT unscented!,"these wipes work fine, but I cannot stand the smell. they don't smell like baby powder or another 'baby' scent, but they do smell gross. also pretty expensive and not worth it."
2,Very thin and cheap,"We had Huggies One and Done, then 7th Generation. Huge difference. 7th feels cheap and sometimes the sheets are not properly cut (stuck together). See the images I uploaded for comparison. The opening is a thin, cheap piece of tape that is hard to reseal between wipes. Compare to Huggies' well-constructed plastic covering that can be properly closed and opened for secure closure, it is no brainer that you should not waste money on this product, no matter how much less chemical it is used. Everything has chemicals in it, whenever you buy a processed product. Unless you mill your own paper and produce your own baby wipes, chemicals are in everything. Don't believe the hype of chemicals not in this product. They all do. Just use less and you're set."
3,"Nice to be green, but old formula was better","I like the idea of greener products, but I am not impressed with this reformulation (from a few years back with my first child). The sheets are smaller, drier and fewer to a package than before. The resealable packaging is nice though and good for travel.I've switched to Tushies which I think performs better, although I don't like that the sheets are perforated together and therefore harder to get out of the box, but they are bigger, a tad more moist to do the job well, and smell cleaner (unscented). They do not have a resealable package so I only use them from a dispenser box at home."
1,Smell Terrible,"These are by far and away the worst baby wipes I have ever encountered. The baby poop smells better than the wipe. It's nauseating. And, they are thin and kind of dry, but that would be fine if there smell weren't so awful. I'm getting a sense from the other reviews that this might be a cilantro type thing-doesn't bother most people but some may just have a terrible reaction."
1,worst wipes I've ever used. mother of 4,Trust me when I say these cloths are about as wet as a dry cloth. Don't waste your money. I'll stick to Kirkland brand wipes.
2,They smell bad,"Instead of unscented, they should say fragrance-free, they are NOT unscented. They smell terrible. I was all for something more natural, and was hoping to stick without fragrance...but these are def. not the ones I'm going to stick with. I have to use through this whole box I ordered (which sucks) and I have already cancelled this subscription. As far as wetness, I found them to be wet enough and big enough comparable to other natural-type wipes I've used before (California Organics). I just can not handle the smell...really...it is bad."
1,Dissapointing!,"We purchased the other 7th Gen wipes with the hard plastic top and were satisfied. This version did not specify the packaging and product was different. We found the package flimsy, impossible to pull one wipe out without pulling three or four, and lastly the wipes were no better then a cheap wet tissue. Hard to save the envirnment with this product. Original packing and product much better."
3,do not like their smell,"Bought this because I can't find the Tushies wipes that I have used for the past three years, which are amazing in my opinion.These seem ok, they are moist and soft but they have a weird smell that I can't stand, so I am going to try other brands."
5,Great wipes,We love these wipes. They are wet enough for our baby and do a great job. I like the container they come in - easy to get out and they store very well. They are also easy to fit in my diaper bag. Seventh Generation baby products are very well made and environmentally friendly to boot. They are my favorite!!
2,Returned this item! Poor quality,"Its getting 2 starts because the return was so easy and hassle free. I ordered 3 cases of these since it was a great deal and free of perfumes and dyes, etc. After opening just 1 package and using the wipes for the first time I was really disappointed. I had previously used Pampers and Huggies wipes. These wipes are super thin and I have to use 2-3 times more. They dry out quickly and arent even that moist to begin with. I would have returned the entire case but since I already opened it, I had to use the rest of it - not on my baby bu more on just cleaning up around the house. Amazon did take the other cases back. Im sticking to Pampers or Huggies from now on!"
2,disappointed...,"These wipes might be better in terms of the added ingredients in comparison to other brands, but the smell is just plain horrible! They smell as if my baby already pooped in them! I had to cancel my subscription for this item and now looking for a better product.And as other reviewer mentioned - the don't feed well through the dispenser and are pretty dry.So disappointing..."
4,great wipes,"I found these wipes to be a great product. It doesnt irritate baby's skin. It does have specific smell to it, which im not sure what it is. But supposedly it is free of perfumes. Would recommend"
1,Caused a rash and very red!,Will never buy these again - my daughter has some type of allergic reaction to them. Turns her entire bottom red. Muast be something in them that can cause allergic reaction and they smell horrible and small!!! Love eco friendly products - but these just to make the cut!
5,New Mom Loves Wipes,We used these while in Bangladesh adopting our baby girl. I love them! They're healthy and effective.
4,Great product,These are great to have around even though we don't have any babies. I just have them in the car or when we go camping. They are unscented and gentle on the skin. I even use it on my dog sometimes when he has stuck his face in something smelly; it works great and buys me some time before I can give him a bath!
5,"Love these wipes, no more crying!","My poor baby gets aweful, blitering, and sometimes bleeding rashes with every other poopy diaper. Between Burt's Bees diaper cream (which treats her rashes 10x better than any other I have tried, and sooths instead of stings) and these wipes, she has only had one rash in the last 4 months! When I first started using them I immediately noticed a pleasant soapy smell, instead of one of chemicals, and when wiping my baby when a rash is present she doesn't seem to be in pain! Maybe because of chlorine and other chemicals being present in other wipes, I can only speculate. But with other wipes (I was using I high end sinsitive skin wipe) it was obviously painful for her to be wiped, but these she doesn't even flinch at when I wipe her. Aside from the benefits for the Earth, if your baby is experiencing any kind of chronic bottom issue, those are the two products I recommend."
2,Not nearly as good as Kirkland wipes,"I have many years of diaper changing experience under my belt and have used many brands of wipes. I wanted to like these wipes, but they fell short of my expectations and smelled strange to boot. They are small, insufficiently moist, have poor cleaning ability, and a bizarre chemical-sweet smell to them (they are marketed as unscented!) We were happy to get through the seemingly endless supply and were pleased to be reunited with our tried-and-true Kirkland wipes, which are the best bang for the buck in my opinion."
4,Gentle but Dry,"I liked these wipes for my newborn's sensitive skin. However, they are not very wet so you may have to use a few for particularly big dump or hold it over dried poop to loosen it up. I've used Earth's Best which are also really good but very wet. So, when I use those, I have to wait for the wetness to dry. It's a toss up!"
4,Good Wipes,"I bought these because I use the Seventh Generation diapers for my baby girl and I really like them. The wipes are great because they don't have all of the chemicals that normal wipes have. My daughter has very sensitive skin and these wipes do not irritate her at all. It is also great that they come is such a big box. My only complaint would be that the individually wrapped packages are very small. You need 2 packages just to fill up one regular sized wipes container. This seems to be a little wasteful in my opinion. They also don't smell the greatest, but I guess this has to do with the lack of chemicals. They don't have a bad odor, just don't smell as nice as some of the other brands. I guess you have to make compromises to get chlorine free. Overall, they are great and I would recommend them to others."
1,"Smaller than other wipes, and have a terrible smell!","I unfortunately ordered a case so I'm stuck with them for a while. The wipes are much smaller and thinner than other brands, and they have a terrible smell! The package says that product is fragrance free, but the wipe have a very strong, distinctive rancid odor. Has anyone else experienced the same thing? Or did I somehow get a bad case?"
5,No More Diaper Rash!!,"These wipes are great. When our daughter was first born, we were using Parent's Choice, which were horrible. She had diaper rash by age 2 weeks. We switched to these and the diaper rash went away pretty quickly. They're great because they're natural. Very soft wipes too, you can feel the moisturizers in them. I'll never switch again!"
1,So disappointed...,"I bought these because I am a fan of Seventh Genration's other products like dish soap, spray cleaner, hand wash, etc...I regret buying these. I am SO disappointed with these wipes. There are a few complaints:1) They are SO dry. There's not enough moisture to wipe away a mess, so I end up using twice as many and literally scrubbing my daughter's heiny to get it clean.2) They don't feed through the refillable container well. They are always coming apart, so you have to open the lid and grab more and then re-feed it though the pop up top. Not always easy to do when you have a squirmy 10 month old in one hand!3) They are very thin and small.4) They smell bad.I cancelled my subscribe and save for these wipes, and I will never buy them again."
1,"quality of product has gone down, as with the economy","I absolutely agree with zinnia829, I've been using these for the past 9 months since my son was born & didn't have any problems with them (albeit, I use a ton of Cali baby moisturizer to prevent diaper rash), but the recent batch is of such low quality- thinner & drier, the sheets separate as I'm pulling them out of my wipe warmer, then I have to open up the warmer to thread through a new sheet- several times a day with a baby who's trying to rolling out of the changing table every time ! These wipes just don't remove poo, it's so bad that sometimes I have to use my fingers cause I can't get to the sink to wet the wipes. I need to stop my subscribe & save- cause in the end I'm not saving any time or money with these."
4,"Good, but not the best.","I've used these for the past 3 1/2 months. I've occasionally used huggies or something similar because I ran out and was waiting on my Amazon delivery. I much prefered Seventh Generation over Huggies, as they are stronger (Huggies seem too paper-like and tear very easily) and they don't contain as many chemicals. I also tried a pack of Tushies wipes just for comparison and seriously could not wait to be done with the package (they were smaller, dryer, and stuck together so it took 2 hands to get a wipe out of the warmer). However, I recently decided to try Earth's Best wipes and was surprised at the superior quality. They seem softer, moister, and even bigger than Seventh Generation. I am a huge 7th Gen fan, and will continue to use their diapers and cleaning products, but will be buying Earth's Best wipes from now on."
1,Not good for the environment,"I trust 7th generation to sell quality eco-friendly products, but I am so disappointed in their baby products. These wipes come in plastic packaging and are not biodegradable. Their diapers are plastic too. If you really care about the environment, use Nature Babycare until 7th gen gets their act together."
2,"Too small, and very dry!","I wish I had taken the advice of other reviewers before purchasing an entire case of these! I had barely gotten over the pain of having to return a case of the Nature Babycare wipes (chemical ingredient concerns that I didn't notice until after ordering). The 7th Gen wipes are smaller than most other wipes and quite dry no matter where you are in the stack or how you store them. I had to use twice as many just to get the job done. **Beware of having to pay return shipping costs!! It really cuts into your refund. Perhaps buying a single pack somewhere to try them first would be advised. Hopefully, the Earth's Best reviews hold up and we'll have found our wipe to stick with. Cheers! And good luck!"
1,don't work like they used to,"I don't know what it is about this recent batch that I received. They seem old--drier than usual. And even when I spritz extra water on, they just don't seem to clean well at all. I can not get rid of a strong urine smell, for example, and cleaning after a soiled diaper is particularly frustrating. I see little advantage of these over a wet rag. The only good thing about them is that I will not have to grumble about them for long. I seem to be using at least 2-3 times as many wipes, trying to get bottoms clean. I rarely take the time to write reviews, but I have not been happy with this product and I will be canceling my subscription."
2,Didn't meet expectations,"Like many other consumers of this product, I purchased them because they were better for the environment and my baby. However, I quickly discovered that the ""unscented"" claim did not fit the product. For my sensitive nose, I quickly began to despise using them during every diaper change because of the bitter smell. In addition, the smoothness of each wipe seemed to make cleaning bowel movements more of a challenge. Perhaps if they were textured, wiping would be more effective. Obviously, this is just from my personal experience, and I would not recommend them to other parents."
1,These aren't for babies with sensitive skin....,"I bought these repeatedly thinking that they must be the best because they are chlorine free and unscented. So I used these on my daughter from day one, with the first ten days rinsing per the doc's recommendation. How little did I know, in that the following two months my daughter would have the most persistent diaper rash from these wipes. I'd switch to cloth to wipes and heavy creams to get rid of the rash. And then I'd be out and start using these again, and not linking the rash and these wipes together (baby brain). Once we switched to Pampers Sensitves we've not have a diaper rash since. I tortured my poor daughter with a horrid rash just because of these wipes. So yes they are strong, smell wierd, but earth friendly, just not always baby friendly."
3,Inconvenient,"GOOD ENOUGH TEMPORARILY! Because these baby wipes have polyethelyne (PET plastic #1) in the material, you can't let it get too warm or it will release a toxin called antimony. It is inconvenient that I cannot keep these in the place where I want them, b/c it is a room that can get very warm. I have to keep them in a very inconvenient place. The rest of the ingredients (besides the other safe plastic #2 they put in it) are natural. I really like the price and I hope they remove the PET plastic in the future, so I can continue to make purchases- I have written them. In the meantime, if I ever come across any other natural baby wipes with all safe ingredients for close to the same price, I will definitely change my brand."
2,Not as good as Earth's Best,"Tried switching to these guys after the recent Earth's Best price hike. Bad idea. As the other reviews say, these are smaller than the Earth's Best, which doesn't really bother me as much, but the real problem is that they're so much drier that it takes a lot more wipes (I'd say 3x as many) to clean my child, and even then I'm not sure that he's really all that clean since he's just getting wiped over and over again with a fairly dry wipe. The wipes do get moister as you get down into the pack, but still not as much as Earth's Best and Earth's Best are moist from the first wipe to the last. So looks like I'm going back to Earth's Best since I definitely prefer them, despite the recent price hike."
2,You get what you play for,"Good value but....they aren't very thick and my baby still reeks a little after I use these. In pinch I'd get these for the price but, you get what you pay for"
2,scentsensitivemom,"I give it 2 star because I really dislike the smell of the wipes. I bought this because it says it doesn't contain alcohol, fragrance or chlorine. The first time I opened the seal and took one wipe out, I immediately smelled the stench. The stench even stays on my fingers - have to wash my hands ASAP. The wipe doesn't take off the poop easily so I really need at least 3 wipes to clean a small amount of poop. I don't recommend this product."
2,Didn't work well for my little one with eczema.,"My son has really sensitive skin and I thought these wipes would work well for him because of all of the good reviews. The wipes were a little small and the polyester in them didn't suit my child's sensitive bum. If you have a child with really sensitive skin, I wouldn't suggest these wipes."
2,meager wipe,"These wipes are a lot smaller and thinner than your average wipe. Not only do you need to use more for a given mess, but it's a lot harder to keep your hands clean."
4,Love them,The best wipes I have found so far and just to know that they don't have all the bad chemicals.
2,thin,"I loved the diapers, but the wipes are thin. I had to use a lot of wipes for something that should of took 1 or 2 wipes. I think if they where a little thinker it would make them better."
2,USELESS Someone PLEASE make a better all natural wipe!,"Every time I buy these wipes, which is only about once a year, I am reminded of what a waste this product actually is! Not only are they too dry to be useful but they are too small for even my tiny hands and they get bunched up in my hand. What are they good for I want to know? And why are they so dry? Is it it the plastic box that's not sealed properly or are they cheap on water? They really need to redesign this product to actually work. I use them for my bathroom because they are all natural but babies need an all natural solution and I feel badly for parents who are stuck with this. Sorry 7th Gen...love your other products but this is a fail."
2,GROSS,"These wipes are awful. They do not do a decent job of cleaning my newborn son. It takes many wipes to get him clean. The worst part of these wipes though is their smell. It smells like stinky feet, and after a few days of using my son started to smell like them. I'll spend the extra money and buy the Earth's Best wipes."
3,Great except for the container,"I usually buy the refill packs and put them in a Huggies container. This time I wanted to try the Seventh Generation container. While the wipes are excellent, they always fall back into the container and are very hard to get back up. I end up just taking off the entire top to get wipes instead of just lifting the flap. The only reason I gave this product three stars is because of the container. The wipes themselves get 10 stars!!!!"
3,it's ok,the wipes are not as 'wet' as perhaps previously? I am not sure. It would be nice if each sheet were larger too. It is nice they are good for the environment and do have no harmful ingredients to the baby.
2,"Love Seventh Generation wipes, don't like this item!!","Don't order this item, unless you want 12 big plastic tubs of wipes. Seventh Generation makes great wipes, but get their refill packs--Seventh Generation Baby Wipes Refills, Chlorine Free and Unscented, 80-Count Packs (Pack of 12) (960 Wipes)-- cheaper, 90% less packaging, easier to store, and perfectly easy to use. If you want a plastic tub, buy one at the store! No one needs 12!"
2,"Fewer, smaller, and worse quality--but same high price","There used to be 80 wipes per pack, now there are 70. They're also smaller. Neither of these issues would bother me if in reducing the number of wipes, SG also reduced the price--but they haven't (in some places, I think the price has gone up). Moreover, the quality has gone down. A particular peeve of mine--the wipes aren't always cut, so when you try to take ""one"" out--you get several, which, of course, you can't put back in. What a waste. My opinion of SG has definitely gone down. I'm actively looking for other options to replace this and the other SG products I use."
2,I really wanted to like them...,"I am a big fan of seventh generation cleaning products. I really wanted to like their baby wipes. I thought they had a really unpleasant smell, which I could overlook in light of the wipes being unscented and natural cleansers on them. But what I cannot overlook is that the wipes are really small and flimsy. Each diaper cleaning I would end up with really dirty hands. I have been diapering one boy after another for 7 years now and can usually change a child without getting my hands covered in their potty, but not with these wipes. Really disappointing."
2,Thin and flimsy,"These wipes work well for average situations, however if the child is particularly messy or wiggles things can get difficult. The wipes themselves are very thin so you use more than you would with other wipes. Additionally b/c they are thin, I don't think it's as easy to clean. The opening to the package doesn't have any sort of lip so it's hard to get one wipe at a time and the closure is just a sticker so I'm constantly pulling it all the way off which causes the wipes to dry out a bit.They are soft though.Will try to find a different product."
2,Don't really like these wipes.,"I ordered these because it was a good price. My daughter is older now, and is potty trained, so I don't use wipes as much as I used to. I still do use them some, to wipe feet, hands, face, etc. They are really thin and you have to use several to get things clean. Another thing, they stink. They are supposed to be unscented, but the smell bothers my daughter and she fights me every time I try to wipe her face, and she has never done that. There may be some who like these, but I won't buy these again."
2,wouldnt buy again,"?? Unscented ?? These down right stink. Will NOT be buying these againThe only pro is there softSeveral cons, THIN, STINK, Smaller than my usual brand"
2,couldn't stand the smell,"These are smaller than Huggies wipes, but that didn't bother me. What did was the scent. Although they are unscented - it doesn't mean they don't smell. It was actually somewhat of a chemical smell for me and I had a hard time dealing with it. Loved that they were chlorine free, but couldn't get past the smell."
3,Strange Smell,"I ordered the unscented wipes, but still found that they had a strange smell, unlike the unscented Kirkland wipes. Other than that, I like that they are chlorine free and think they hold up better than Huggies wipes."
3,Too Small,"The wipes are O.K. quality wise, however I've noticed the last ones remaining in the wipe warmer got pretty dry. They are also very SMALL I have to use several wipes to clean messy number 2. I like the fact they are chlorine free, but to be very honest I will go back to Wallmart's Parent's Choice unscented (blue pkg, cloth texture)those are amazing, cost much less and never gave my baby any rash."
5,Love Willow Tree!,I received this plaque as a gift many years ago for a wedding present. I loved it so much I bought one for my sister-in-law as a belated wedding present as well.
2,Poor fit & finish,The table top slopes with no adjustments available to level it. The upright attached to the table top is wobbly. The foot rests of a standard wheelchair do not clear the lateral bar at the base so the user cannot get close to the table.
5,"Overbed Table, Wheelchair Desk by Rubbermaid","It's not as heavy or clumsy in use as the ones in hospitals, and it's a lot cheaper. It's also stable, easy to adjust up and down, and is light enough to pick up easily. Assembly is fast and simple.Rubbermaid Deluxe Overbed Table - Wheelchair DeskPurchased at Amazon, service was fast without complications. Highly recommended by this reviewer, who is a caregiver."
5,AN OUTSTANDING ADDITION TO THE TRADITIONAL LEGEND OF ZORRO!!,If you believe that injustice is wrong and if you support the idea that one man who is of outstanding courage and bravery can stand against overwhelming odds and still make a difference then you will enjoy and applaud this rousing addition to the Zorro legend. May the ideas and the character of Zorro continue to live in our hearts and spirits!!! For those who continue to force their injustice on others....Fare thee well...For SENOR ZORRO RIDES TONIGHT!!!
2,I don't think it should be a Zorro.,"This movie I guess I am rather ashamed of. I am a Big Zorro fan. I love Zorro. The Z all those things; but this movie was like totally lacking in story line and what it did have didn't really make sense if you thought about it. But that's not really that important for a Zorro is it?! It's the fun and the sword play. Which...I would say it didn't have any of that either. I guess it just doesn't have the charisma of Zorro. I like to fence and when I watch a movie I want to see somebody who at least looks like they would put up a fight against me. I don't think this ""Zorro"" would last more than a few moments. I need to compliment the opening song though!! I love it!!! And all in all for the price I think it may have been worth it."
1,If Zorro is a Fox he's road kill,"I love Zorro. The Z and all that! But this movie was not worthy of to 'wear the mask'.What little story line it had didn't make sense. But that's not really that important for a Zorro is it?! It's the fun and the sword play. (That's important)They didn't have any fun or sword play either.Duncan Regehr might be able to act (I didn't see any proof of that on this movie) I'll give him the benefit of the doubt though; but he cannot fence! I am myself a fencer and sword fighter-whatever you want to call it. I've fought with Broad Swords, Rapiers, Short Swords, Knives, and even spears, and a whole bunch more medieval weaponry. I can tell you right now! Duncan Regehr can't sword fight. When I watch a Zorro I want to see somebody who might be able to beat me. The Sword fighting was pathetic. It makes me want to take on the whole Mexican army with my right hand tied behind my back!"
5,Zorro lives again!,"Duncan Regehr plays Zorro in this Family Channel series from the early 1990s. This entry is a 90 minute special recounting how Don Diego became Zorro in this particular retelling. Regehr brings a certain dash and intelligence to his Zorro. Coupled with the traditional black mask and swift stallion, the combination brings a new twist to the character,that of an inquisitive scientific tinkerer with the traditional superlative skill with a saber. This is a good entry to introduce kids to Zorro too. If television must be called upon to provide heroes again, then Regehr's Zorro is an excellent choice. END"
1,Strictly for Breeders,"If you want info on how to care for your pet rabbit, don't even bother with this book. It's strictly written for breeders, and the medical information is very, very out of date. The pictures are all straight from the American Rabbit Breeders Association poster. This books presumes that you treat rabbits like saleable commodities, rather than as living creatures."
4,Great video,"I bought this DVD without the benefit of a review, so I felt a little vulnerable about it. I am 20 weeks pregnant. I searched for DVDs that allowed me to do Pilates while still pregnant. Something about the reviews of those videos caused me to NOT want to get one. So I got this one, and I am VERY happy with it. It definitely works your muscles, but I never felt overly strained or exhausted. It's about 40 minutes, which is great. There is a warm up, a cardio portion, and then a warm down/strengthening portion. What I like about it is the instructor is not pregnant, but she has 2 pregnant women doing the exercises with her--a woman in her 2nd trimester and a woman in her 3rd trimester. And these women will show you the modifications that are recommended for women in those stages of pregnancy. I would definitely recommend this video for someone who is interested in staying fit during her pregnancy. You need weights, a chair, and some pillows, but all can be done in your home easily."
4,Great video for expectant moms,"I didn't really know what to expect with this video, but since I had the Buff Brides book from a while back and enjoyed it, I thought I'd give it a try. It's a really great video for any expectant moms - if you've never worked out before or if you work out all the time. I worked out a lot before trying this video and it still made me feel pretty sore the next day. But as I've gotten used to all of the squatting and other moves, it's very easy to do and quite enjoyable. It's a soothing video and really does wonders when my back is hurting or I'm just generally feeling uncomfortable. It helps to loosen me up and provide a lot more flexibility and stability. I am 32 weeks now and will continue using it for as long as I can. And I plan to buy Buff Moms once the baby is born!"
2,Too easy & the only shape I'm in is ROUND,"I am NOT in good shape. I am pregnant with baby #6 and never quite lost the extra 20lbs with baby #5. I want to workout with hopes that I can take the weight off faster this time. I was doing Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred but got to the point that there's too much I couldn't do anymore considering I'm 22 weeks along. I tried Buff Moms To Be and first I had to get past the very annoying women on it. First the woman who comes on in between sessions then the actual instructor. Even the 2 backup ladies seemed bored. I didn't even break a sweat and I did about 30-40 minutes of it. I can do Jillian's workout for 20 minutes, sweat & KNOW that I got a great workout in. If you're the type that wants a laid back, fairly easy workout then this is for you. But if you want something more intense I wouldn't recommend it. I'm going to try the Perfect Pregnancy Workout with Karyne Steben along with some others."
5,Fantastic Video,"I love this video. It is something that I don't mind doing everyday. I haven't gotten sick of it yet. I feel like it is working the muscles that need to be worked and stretches what needs to be stretched. It gets my heart rate up and sometimes I break a light sweat. The instructor is great. It is also very easy to modify the workout to your comfort level, or pregnancy stage. I'd recommend this video highly to any pregnant woman."
5,Best book ever!,Thi is the best book ever. It is very very detailed.If your into war stories this book is for you.
4,O'Grady's adventure is gripping,"I bought this book by mistake, since I realised rather late that it was a children's version of the more detailed Return with Honor. O'Grady daoes not go into many details regarding his unit, enemy's weapons, or tactics but he gives an excellent account of his six days in the Bosnian countryside, where he survived by sheer willpower and clever attitude. He was lucky to be found by his buddies just as his physical strength was nearing its end. I really appreciated his insistence that he did not consider himself a hero and that he reserved this honor for the fallen comrades of the past. A nice read of a modern real-life adventure."
4,Scot O' Grady,"Basher Five-Two by Scott O'Grady and Michael French is a good book about Captain Scott O'Grady's time in Bosnia after his plane was shot down. The main chacter is Air Force Captain Scott O' Grady. Some of the things that that kept me reading were the obstacles Scott had to overcome. One of my questions as I read this book was, ""Is somone going to rescue him?"" I never knew what was going to happen next. This book is full of adventure and action. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about Air Force pilots who have survived plane crashes in enemy territory and people who like to read action and adventure stories."
4,small error,"As a children's library clerk, I see many such books in the course of my work. This is a lovely picture book; however, one thing bothers me: the baby fox is repeatedly referred to, both in the blurb and the actual text, as a 'fox cub'. Baby foxes are not cubs. They are kits. I hope this will be corrected in later editions."
2,ok,brought this base on the review i read here for only one review and man i should not of did that it freezes and very slow but if this program didnt do that it would be amazing thought it was my computer that was making it freeze took it to a friends house hes like a computer nerd computer all tricked out worked a little better but not much it focus's on to many other things than what it is really for to make music
2,No the bible,"Sorry, but this is not the bible of PS. It is too superficial and very basic. There are other books on the subject tha can claim the bible title, i. e. The Business of Advising, or Maister's books."
3,Maxi Regular para un album genial,Genial cancion con PLAVKA.Lo Bueno: Incluye el video y 2 remixes muy buenos.Lo Malo: de las 6 pistas de audio solo 2 remixes estan bien.Un maxi que sabe a poco (por la cantidad de pistas) Quizas estaba acostumbrado a que la mayoria de remixes en los maxis de J&S; son geniales.imprescindible para un fan.
2,Not so Hot!,"I bought this thermometer with great expectations, notwithstanding some unfavorable reviews from other customers about inaccuracy and erratic behavior.Before ordering I called the manufacturer to ask if they had corrected the problems and were shipping from inspected and checked inventory.I was assured by the company rep that the thermometers were perfect and that in addition they were ""fully guaranteed"". First I checked the thermometer against others in my home and found it to be off from 3-5 degrees. At other times it was accurate. I gave it every benefit of doubt and tried to adjust it according to directions, to no avail. I really didn't have time for all this. Finally I returned it to Amazon for credit, disappointed in the whole affair. The $5.99 Timex that I bought at the same time works perfectly."
2,Inaccurate above 80 degrees,"We lead our horses into the barn when it is hotter than 95 or colder than 40. This instrument gives false readings when temps exceed 80. Yes, we recalibrated while getting instructions from them over the phone. You would be as well served by a plastic thermometer for $6."
5,Pleased,"So far it is good, do not like the fact my Vermont Thermometer was made in China, I try to buy as many things as I can that are made in the USA."
3,The needle scrapes,"After a couple of years in a rather protected location, the face has buckled or shifted slightly (I guess) so that the needle scrapes and binds, giving ""stuck"" readings."
1,Love how it looks but it doesn't tell the temperature!,"I have two of these - one I had bought from Smith & Hawken a long while back, which seems to be accurate. We wanted another one for the other side of our house so I tried this. This one looks similar but the temperature is way off. We kept thinking the temperature might be that different on either side of our house, but we're finally admitting it's not below freezing outside the dining room window, under the sheltered eaves, on the warm side of the house, when it's in the 40s on the cold weather side of the house where the old thermometer is. . .Back to the drawing board. I'm looking for a round, pretty copper outdoor thermometer made in the U.S. so please if anyone knows of such an item post it here. Thank you."
2,"Good to look at, not good for the temp. Here's why...","I have to admit this thing is gorgeous. Nice copper, stands proud from the sill, etc. all as advertised. But it just doesn't work correctly. First of all it it heats up like a frying pan in the sun so every day it's 90+ degrees by noon. I live in New England so you would think in the winter this wouldnt be much of a problem, but it heats up everyday every season.You could put in in the shade but I don't have a spot like that anywhere near my kitchen or a window. I do have a shady side of the house but to put this there defeats the whole purpose - we are never over there and would have to walk across the house to see the temp. Not ideal.So if you plan to put this anywhere there is sun, get something else. It needs to be in the shade all the time or it doesn't work.Good luck."
4,beautiful USA-made but a bit smaller than I expected,"I am impressed with the quality and I get why they made it relatively small -- after all, you can mount it right outside a window so you can just look outside to see the temperature. So the size isn't a detractor but you should be prepared for the fact that this is a small but lovely theromometer."
1,Beautiful but non-functional,"Previously we had a thermometer just like this one. It lasted 10+ years. I wanted to replace it with one just like it after it broke. I did read the reviews, but felt that we had such a good experience I would take the risk. MISTAKE. It is beautiful but would not register the correct temperature-not even close. The needle seemed to be rubbing against the glass and not moving properly. I will be returning it and finding something else."
2,NOT THE BEST HARNESS,"I bought this for my 80 lbs. boxwer. He loves to go for walks, but pulls a lot and I cannot walk him. I bought this harness because I heard good things about it, but here are the main flaws I found:- difficult to find the right fit/ difficult to adjust- the leash connects at the chest area, not the back ( which is odd)- one of the buckles hits right under the armpit, causing injury** after using it the first time, I noticed my dog was bleeding from under his right arm! It turns out the buckle kept rubbing on his skin, causing it to bleed. I resolved the problem by adding some padding around that part of the harness so it wouldn't hurt my dog. It seems to have worked.BOTTOM LINE: not the best product, probably not suited for all dogs."
4,A fine reference guide...,"But make no mistake this is not a book to be read or analyzed. This is a quick reference guide. I have 5 - 6 Scotland Golf guidebooks in my possession. The information contained in this book is compiled from Golf World readers.The comments and rankings don't appear to differ dramatically from the more comprehensive books.Because of the ranking system, I did find this a useful book when finalizing a trip itinerary..."
3,You Get What You Paid for...,This Was Very Good Price But after I Took It off Like 10 times it Broke so I Have No Case No More... :(
2,Not worth the cost,"This decal was very difficult to apply to a large window such as rear truck as it is made for. It had to be cut to size which was more challenging than imagined. If not done with precision it shows! Difficult to manage application, wrinkles, bubbles, tears, and curls up at edges... Therefore you cannot put window up and down if your truck is able to without compromising the decal. Looks good from a distance, but overall disappointing and expensive ($70) cool sticker!"
3,"Good, but....","This is a well researched and very useful source; however, it is more tailored for younger readers; i am sending it a grandson"
5,Getting started,"After reading Patrick O'Brian's book,my only complaint is I wish it were longer.This is a reference companion to his Aubrey/Maturin Novels and I feel compelled to read them all.I feel this book does exactly what it intends, take someone as green as I and get them excited about reading his books and doing some further research.Patrick o'Brian's love for the Royal Navy is contagious."
3,Additional material for Aubry series,"It turned out to be not as thick as I imagined it would be. Has great color plates and lots of areas of ship life. Explains more of the human aspect of marine life whereas the Illustrated Companion explains the ships, the travels, the dangers, and a little of the men/boys who went out."
4,Good introduction to Nelson's Navy,"This book is short, simply written, with good illustrations and photos. It gives a good introduction to the navy of Nelson's time--not a lot of detail, but this would be excellent for someone starting the Master and Commander series. It would also be good as an introduction for older children who have an interest in the subject."
5,Absolutely Beautiful,"How you could NOT like this CD is beyond me. The feelings it invokes are indescribable. It touches your soul the instant you hear it. I've gotten 3 of his CD's so far, and plan on buying the rest. The word ""Amazing"" doesn't do this man's talent justice. He's a gift from heaven. Everyone should hear it at least once. That's all you'd need. Absolutely incredible...."
5,Wonderful Purchase,"I am totally sold on Nawang Khechog. The first time I played this CD in the car my 17 year old son fell asleep, so you know it must be good. While meditating with this music in the background, I was moved to tears after which I experienced great calm. I can't recommend this enough."
3,"Decent flute playing, ....But..","This Cd tend to become monotonous very quickly and will not be played often, it is good for sleep."
1,Sad sad day....,It depresses me when a book like this can get such rave reviews form people. This isn't even poetry.
5,Spam is sexy meat!,"An inspiring and sensual book. Full of rollicking good fun and a wild scents of humor. If you like poetry both absurd and sublime--check it out. You won't be able to resist writing a few yourself.When the moon is pink, I am full of emptiness, And miss you like Spam."
4,Good for a little laugh...make that a BIG laugh,"Being a bit of a poetry fan, and enjoying most things Japanese, and enjoying some downright silly humor will help you really enjoy this little collection compiled by SHAM (Spam Haiku Archive Master) John Cho. No, most of its not true Haiku, but who cares, its fun...really fun. Despite the complete absurdity of this little book, some of it is actually quality haiku. I never thought that three line poetry about a disgusting pseudo-meat could merit praise, but some of this is downright genius. Some of it is juvenile, and a few stray into the realm of tasteless...but if you ignore those you'll really enjoy this. (come to think of it, you probably don't have to enjoy poetry at all to laugh at this.) If it weren't for some of the ones that were a little vulgar and/or using sexual innuendo, I would give this a perfect 5."
4,17 silly syllables,"What a whacky idea to mix spam and the Japanese Haiku! If you are looking for a way to wile away the hours writing sometimes profound and sometimes worthless words, use this little book for inspiration. Then you can go to the spamku's web site and submit some of your best/worst efforts for others to read."
4,tired of complaining,alright after reading over 50 peoples reveiws of xpw i think its time somebody spoke on xpw's behalf. i am tired of people saying that xpw is crap and that this organization cant premote. yeah well id like to see you promote wrestling. its not exactly easy you know. but anyway this product im writing a reveiw for is supposed to be 13 episodes and in my opionion is a pretty good idea.
5,GREAT VIDEO!!,I loved the songs and how the video started with the very early Bowie that was so creative and fun.
2,not bad but not worth it,"Normally i'd be all aglow about this item, but they edited the videos, aparently to make them safe of children or some other reason, i don't know why. I wish I knew, man what a waste of money. perhaps I'm just a Bowie purist. I want my (money) back but only if it comes with an apology from Bowie himself."
2,Sound Quality Poor,"I was quite disappointed in the sound quality of this DVD set. The DVD is not even in dolby digital and sounds flat. Some tracks are not even in stereo. EMI, you blew it man. The sex pistols were right. If I did not receive this as a gift I would have gotten my money back."
5,Bowie is the best,"I've enjoyed this 2-disc DVD set for many years now. The collection of music videos and live performances is just lovely. It's especially fun to see David progress through his many on-stage personalities, from the early performances like ""Five Years"" with his still-blond hair and green jumpsuit, to ""John, I'm Only Dancing"" and ""Young Americans"" when he often lacked eyebrows and donned a variety of creative makeup and accessories, to his ""Thin White Duke"" phase, the happy pop persona of the 1980s, spiky hair and chin-beard of the 1990s, and finally an older, slightly calmer Bowie in ""Thursday's Child"" and ""Survive"". Throughout the decades of music represented here, Bowie remains both innovative and entertaining. Easter eggs on DVDs can be a pain to find, but some of these are worth it, particularly the featurette for the song ""Blue Jean"". I had no idea that this existed!Bowie fans young and old should enjoy this DVD for its variety of performances and sheer entertainment value."
4,So where is It?,"Brett Anderson (lead singer for Suede) once asked Bowie during a Q&A why he seldom performs ""Let Me Sleep Beside You"" live. He might well have asked why the song rarely appears in Bowie retrospectives, audio or video. Licensing issues, perhaps, but its a shame that the video--which shows the thin white one playing his guitar in a blank setting a la ""Be My Wife""-- could not be included in this collection. Despite its minimalist appearance, it is essential early Bowie at his romantic peak. Given the thoroughness of this video set, you may just have to take my word for it."
2,PAL ....ba-humbug,Seller shipped a PAL [Europe zone] disc. Good thing I have a multi-region player. Most people would have to return this item as it would be unplayable on US dvd equipment.
2,It is what the title says,I wouldn't get this if you want to understand guerrilla warfare. If your doing some kind of research on that time and place then mabey.
5,GOOD FUN,"Grew up watching J.P. like most of the kids in the Pacific Northwest. Brought back a lot of memories, lot of fun to watch again."
4,Great Cultural Experience,"This DVD is truly a great cultural experience. Joseph Hill at his best in South Africa, superbely filmed and recorded. An impressive document containing most of his hits. If it were not for the ""Morgan Heritage Live in Europe 2003"" DVD this one would have competed for the best reggae DVD available."
4,Culture,"Great to see Joseph Hill, RIP,. I wish the sound was better but if you like Culture, it's worth it."
3,I've read better--I've read worse...,"I was surprised about the previous comments about profanity. I don't recall it bothering me that much. I thought there were some uneven aspects to the pace and plot but overall, it was enjoyable, though certainly not the best x files book. If you're not a fan, then this book will bore you, but even if you are an avid watcher, you might be disappointed in the depictions of Mulder and Scully. However, this is an OK read if you're stuck at an airport or have a long plane flight ahead of you..."
3,Confusing and choppy.,"I must admit, I bought this book because of the zeal of an X-File book. I had high expectations because from Kevin J. Anderson's books, I knew what was happening. Here, I found myself confused by the twising plot. Plot twists add to the excitement, but with too many, it looks like a ""good"" movie reduced to ""horrible"" because of too much editing."
1,Ack. Ackackackackack,"Sheesh, not what I've come to expect from an X-Files book. The characters were badly portrayed. (what is it with everyone calling Scully by her first name?). Also I thought there was too much of that one guy hitting on Scully, and Mulder checking girls out. I mean, really. The profanity was kinda bad, but no worse than you hear at my school. The plot line was interesting (human chameleons) but it wasn't really taken anywhere, and the ending didn't explain much. Read WHIRLWIND, it's much better."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"First tie-in seen.When a tv show gets really popular, particularly of this sort, there are bound to be books to follow.In this case, it wasn't a particularly good one, unfortunately.Mulder and Scully and some hangers around have to investigate what appear to be attacks by an invisible man. So, bit of a strange title to start with. Just an ordinary, story, really.2.5 out of 5"
3,Goblins is an okay book.,"I enjoyed it. It was alright, but not the best. There were a few spots where I'd have to read a paragraph two or three times until I got it, and then sometimes it still didn't help. I don't remember all the cusing that others have talked about. And if there was, it must not have been enough to distract me. All in all it was a fairly good book."
2,Average...,"A bit of a disappointment for followers of the show since it's not really true to the characters and the plot is a little lacking...but still not bad if you want an entertaining read over the summer. It does more or less have that 'dark' quality created by the show, but is full of weaknesses. Try 'Whirlwind' instead...also on the stupid side but a lot more interesting."
1,Yet another X-Files book,"Although I consider myself an X-Files fan, I shall not buy any more X-Files books. They are badly written, lack a strong plot line, and on Goblins, you can see that the writter has a little *obssesion* with the character of Dana Scully.The book is just a lot of cursing, and apart from that the only other thing that makes you think you're reading an X-Files book, is the characters, and maybe the setting, bcause it all takes place in a dark, gloomy atmosphere.X-File fan or not, I would never recomend thos book to anyone, not even someone I hate. It is just not worth your money, plus it will really let you down."
2,GUTTER MOUTH!,"I was offended with all the cussing. It's not like there was just a little bad language; geisers of profanity gushed out of this book! But I did give it two stars. I thought the story line was decent, though the characters were terribly portrayed. I'd just read Kevin Anderson's three, and they were so much better. I'm reading Whirlwind now, hoping for the best"
2,Not Good - Not Bad - But Why Did They Lose So Big??,"An interesting read for a Notre Dame fan; but never a plausibe explanation for why Notre Dame lost so big under Faust (who seemed like a good guy....just way overmatched for that job). The last 30 years or so seems to show one thing about ND football, they hire the right coach (Ara, Devine, Holtz.....now Weiss??) and they win big. They hire the wrong coach (Faust, Davies, etc.) and they lose big.Faust obviously loves the school (feels like he loves the school more than he loves football) which is great for an administrator, but not for the head coach of the team."
1,A great book if all you need is a history of CD's,"I was under the impression that the book would give a step by step process of creating a CD, if that is what you are looking for, keep looking. It is a 500+ page tome dedicated to the history of the CD & DVD industry and deals in generalities when addressing the possibility of creating a CD."
1,This isn't actually mercurochrome,Note that this isn't actually mercurochrome (merbromin) -- it is benzalkonium chloride. That's the main active ingredient in Bactine.
1,Not Mercurochrome,The product is advertized to be Mercurochrome. It is a substitute product containing no mercury.
1,This product dont work as good as the original one,This is not the original Mercurochrome that you grew up with. The FDA has banned the highly effective merbromin 2% solution that was perhaps the best antiseptic. The old saying goes keep them sick and they will come back. Its another of their several scare tactics. I have tried using this substitute product containing Benzalkonium Chloride but its not as effective as the original one. I still have open cut even after a week of applying this fake junk. I know people still using Mercurochrome all over the world that are 90 years old who swear by it. Not a single person has reported mercury poisoning from using the real Mercurochrome. Tuna and Swordfish contain more mercury but those are not banned. The filling used in teeth also contains mercury and that's not banned. Aspartame is not banned. Its a shame that FDA has become corrupt and will do anything for money nowadays. Such a shame.
1,just look at the label,"Just look at the label in the picture - ""Mercury Free Formula"". This is NOT real mercurochrome. Very deceptive."
4,Suitable for the Nails..,"Well, it seems that almost yearly, Cleopatra is pumping out ""tribute"" albums to various artists ranging from ""Madonna"" to ""David Bowie"". Being a huge NIN fan, of course I had to check this album out and as most big fans of bands do, I rarely like covers done by other bands but I really must say, I was very very shocked with this album. There's a little goth (newlydeads) and a little industrial (razed in black) and a little of everything in between (candymachine88). Impressive from beginning to end it will keep you on your toes with covers from the old and the new. Definatly worth a look in my opinion and its not just for NIN fans, everyone should try it out for a taste of new bands and old giving tribute to the great band, Nine Inch Nails"
2,S' all right,"I'm not a big Nine Inch Nails fan, but I was curious to see what other people could do with his work. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be much. In most cases, the covers on this cd just made me want to hear the originals. A few exceptions worth noting are the covers of Piggy, Reptile, Head Like a Hole (which almost sounds like Foetus doing NIN), and Wish (my personal favorite). The Head Like a Hole and Wish covers stand out as original, on a cd of mostly bad imitations."
2,"oh dear god, no","after listening to the radiant decay tribute album and loving it, i thought i would give this one a listen. bad idea! i thought it was horrible. dont get me wrong, there were a couple good songs (i loved pig's jazzy cover of head like a hole even though i normally can't stand jazz), but most of them sounded like they'd torn the originals apart and pasted them back together with a gluestick. i cried all the way through reptile, and meeks' cover of down in it was humorous (to say the least.)if you really want a tribute album, pick up radiant decay. it's much better."
2,what an insult!,"this album is terrible! none of the main singers have any talent to perform any of Reznor's songs, and they totally chop up and ruin the songs while trying to remix the beat to them. In this case, Reznor should be the only one performing these songs, these tribute bands don't know how to work with his music, and they make the music a disgrace when they try."
4,It's not all bad,"Truly this cd is not all that bad. I mean yeah head like a hole was horribly redone and down in it was not the best it could be but really the rest of the tracks aren't all that bad. I really liked the version of reptile and the perfect drug. I haven't been a fan of nin for all that long but I have acquired my fair share of their albums and really like the style Trent has. Oh and yeah I'm from Wisconsin but what are you going to do about some kid from the midwest ""stealing"" ""your"" band?"
3,Overall ok,"This is a good CD to get different versions of NIN songs. Besides some pretty horrible butcherings on Down In It and Head Like a Hole, the CD is good. The best song on the CD is Piggy by Sigue Sigue Sputnik. In my opinion they make Piggy sound better than the original. I've never heard of alot of these groups and on some of the songs, it shows why. Overall, the CD is ok."
2,"No Names, Not Tributes","These are a bunch of no names in the goth metal and dance music era looking for a foothold to get them someplace higher. This is not a tribute. This is a bad CD even if you like goth metal, some parts are good, but then to balance it out some parts are bad for each track, such as the music is totally great, then the singer throws the song off like Star Fers Inc. Other songs the singer is good, but the synth throws the track off, but some songs are just ultimately bad."
1,errrr.,Fu*k this discrace to NIN fu*k it right up it's stupid ass.BTW I like half th bands on here.....or used to.
3,sub and dub suck,"Horrible translation for both sub and dub. Almost fan sub level. ""Soldier's bomb""? That's stupid. It's just ""dust explosion"". Was the translator sleeping in grade school science class?That's just an example. Wrong translation and horrible voice acting are all over the place. Because of them, now, it's a different story that is full of cliche. Ryo's smart analysis of the enemy's strategy is also mistranslated and also simplified. Takeshi's voice acting is STILL too cool; he should sound more frightened, not angry.And I can't stand the line, ""I'm not ready to die."" The children of arms often face near death situations. But (in Japanese) they never say ""I'm not ready to die!""; they are not that heroic. They simply say ""I don't wanna die"", facing the fear of dying and realizing what it means to appreciate their lives. Every child of arms is too wise or heroic in English, even Hayato is."
1,"Fails to stay in the ""up"" position","This product failed within 1 month of installation. It won't stay in the ""up"" position because of a failure of the connection between the spring steel and the cast base. Would not recommend this product."
1,looks good but not,"I purchased this item for a medical center double door for a ambulance, they needed something easy to prop doors open while wheeling in patients. They will hold the door open very well but they lack support to hold them up when not in use. I almost had to remove them because as the door closed they would always come down and not stay up. I temporarily used a paper wedge until I find better product."
1,Cheap (You get what you pay for),"I purchased several (20+) of these door stops and installed them on doors throughout the facility which I manage. After two weeks of use not a single one of these door stops remains in the upright position. I have to remove all of them and purchase something new. If you have a door which which you need propped open 24/7, they should work out great. But if you need a quality door kick, which you expect to serve its purpose, look elsewhere."
1,Low Price For A Reason,"I needed a door holder of at least five inches. All local hardware stores including Home Depot and Lowes only stock four inch door holders in this price range, usually less than five dollars. Most five inch plus door holders are of commercial grade, cost three to four times as much and are overkill for my intended use on a very light home patio door. I removed this item from its packaging and immediately observed it will not stay in the upright position.No problem with the metal itself, but the design to stay in the upright position is poor and obviously cut corners by using a small piece of sheet metal for this purpose that is ineffective. The second part is the ""rod"" connecting the holder to the mounting base is cheaply made and resembles a poor quality rivet. I did not even bothering installing this item. Not even worth the shipping cost to return it. You get what you pay for."
1,Does not stay up,"The listing says:""The stop locks in the up position to allow the door to open freely.""No, it doesn't. The leg keeps coming down at the wrong time, jamming the door open and forcing you to bend down to unblock it.Looks solid, but does a bad job.I will be switching it for theStanley magnetic door stop(which will go on the other side of the door). But I'm annoyed to have drilled four holes in the door, holes that I'll now have to fill, sand and paint."
5,Abraham is Leading Edge Stuff,As always Abraham will speak right to you and you will be uplifted and each time you listen you will get more understanding and it will change your life forever.
4,Always good,The Abraham collection is always good. The interaction with the audience and real life questions and applications are always the best part of these DVDs.
5,XPW....,"Xpw is the best federation ever. it has the most hardcore things you can dream of. from the violentness of Supreme, to the wrestling of the messiah, Xpw has it all. From light tubes to barbed wire, Xpw has it all. From Ladders to tables, Xpw has it all......FROM ECW TO XPW: THE TORCH HAS BEEN PASSED"
2,XPW Hostile Takeover,"Matches are from the August 31, 2002 Hostile Takeover event.Mexico's Most Wanted vs. New Panthers for the XPW Tag Team Titles.Chris Hamrick vs. Kaos in a Ladder Match for the XPW Television Title.Chris Chetti vs. Juventud Guerrera.Sandman vs. Pogo The Clown.Altar Boy Luke vs. Little Guido vs. Vic Grimes.Angel vs. Supreme for the XPW King Of The Death Match Title.Super Crazy vs. Psychosis.Terry Funk vs. Shane Douglas for the XPW Title."
2,Refinement Needed,"There's a ton of paper in this book, overboard, in my opinion. Wading through the pages in search of a hike is downright laborious. I've taken quite a few of the Sierra hikes and the information hasn't been detailed enough to really give me a feel for what to expect on the trail. They miscalculated the mileage and sometimes the elevation. I think it would be a better book if they chopped out half of the listings and concentrated on the truly best hikes in California."
2,Overrated,Very disappointed with the trail information. Most of the hikes I took did not live up to their ratings and some of the directions were wrong. There's alot of information but I now doubt its credability.
2,No Maps,I was surprised to open this book and find no maps. This makes it very hard to get oriented once you've found the trail. The writing is too general and bland. I'm sticking to titles that are more pertinent to the region that have more detailed descriptions. I would have preferred more quality than quantity and more photographs.
2,needs editing,I found this book to be too much like an encyclopedia. There wasn't enough depth to the descriptions. I would have preferred a smaller book that described the trails more carefully; one that fit into my backpack for handy reference.
2,basic-oriented book,ROI is a wide and critical factor in business management. The book title represents high expectations but didn't offer new thinking nor advanced models of ROI.ROI calculations should focus more on finnancial perspectives rather than verbal explanations. Using Excel in any ROI calculations is highly recommended!Dr. Hillel Avihai
5,Excellent practical guide to selling value!,"In this excellent book, Michael Nick provides a practical, insightful guide that will help any sales or marketing professional to accurately describe the full value of their offerings to prospective customers. Unfortunately, few sales professionals really know how to justify the value of their solutions today, but ROI Selling shows exactly how to do this, in a common sense, straight-forward manner. Highly recommended."
5,It's all about VALUE!,"Identifying, quantifying and measuring the value delivered by our products has changed the way we sell, has improved the interest level of our prospects and is in the process of changing the way we deliver after the sale. The concept of a 360 degree review to measure your performance after the fact has raised our credibility to a whole new level.Using the concepts in this book, we have created models proving the benefits we deliver by solving the issues that most commonly impact our buyers."
4,Small but good,This one is for a serious beginner to intermediate brewer. The author is a professional mead and wine judge with a wealth of experience and a few tricks that surprised me especially for the small size of the book. It skimps out on recipes though. It should be noted that this is written by an experienced mead judge.
2,Not the best book for beginners.....,"If you are looking for a step-by-step instruction guide on the process of making mead, this is not the book for you. While he does not spend much time on history, he spends most of the book telling about the chemicals and make-up of mead and it's components. And the processes that he does give, are quite vague. The recipes that are included (which are few) are all based on chemical components, rather than natural processes. However, the book is well written and very easy to read. Another problem I found with the book, is that it is 20 years old. And being written based on the chemical aspect, this could mean that it is outdated. There are however, a few good points of information throughout the book. But if you are looking for a step-by-step ""instruction book"", this is perhaps not the best choice."
5,Great product,As usual the shipping was very fast and items arrived safely. This is the 2nd time I have ordered a set of the Hella H15986001 4 3/4 inch work light and I am delighted (no pun intended) with the product. You will need an electrical person to install them (at least I did. Highly recommend them.
3,HELLA H15986001 Rubber Halogen 4 inch Work Lamp,"Not particularly good quality... obviously off-shore made.I bought 2, 1 unit quit soon, rubber cover tore while opening unit to replace bulb.you get what you pay for... or less as in this case."
2,Click Art Fonts,"Never have I had such high expectations and been so disappointed! This product is disastrously poor. Save your money. Out of 3500 fonts I found exactly two that I thought I could use...and they weren't anything special. There is not a script in the lot and no decorative. Each font is a slight variation of another one. Even the handwriting fonts are bad...they, again, are just slight variations on another. I can't think that Broderbund can remain in business for very long with such a terribly poor product. Other reviewers are correct is saying that Click Art fonts are a waste of money, they are."
4,Another hit,"Absolutely loved My Sisters Keeper and enjoyed this one as well. The story, as usual, takes a different turn than where you thought you were headed. Highly recommended!"
4,Great Book-Great Writer,"I have read several books by this author and I am very impressed with her writing. I thought it was a great story line and very original. My only negative input that I have relates to the time that her father spent in lock up. This portion of the story seemed to drag on and I felt that it was very unnecessary. All in all, it was a great book and I highly recommend it."
2,My least favorite from Picoult,"I have to say, I found the characters in this book somewhat poorly fleshed out, and the plot in general just totally unbelievable. I never seemed to get ""lost"" in this story...i.e., I always was conscious that these were characters in a book, and not ones I could relate to at that. Then there are some fairly ridiculous tangents that seem to serve no purpose as far as driving the plot forward or illustrating points. It reminded me of a bad soap opera!"
2,Vanishing Acts,"This book is disappointing after My Sister's Keeper. The writing was often overblown. Example: ""Let me tell you what happens when you cook down the syrup of loss over the open fire of sorrow.""The characters expresse their points of view in different chapters but the father, the duaghter, the Mexican woman and the two younger men sound exactly the same."
3,Vanishing Acts,I enjoyed the book however the outcome was too predictable. The characters were well developed but it was easy to see where the story would lead.
1,Vanishing Acts,"This was the first book by this author that I've read, and it will definately be the last. Quite frankly, I don't know why I even bothered to finish it. The basic story line was good but she added alot of mythical nonsense that did not even relate to the story. I found myself scanning over the flying feathers, witchcraft and tarot cards often enough to irritate me... The ending left alot to be desired as well."
3,Vanishing Acts Jodi Picoult,I didn't enjoy this book as much as her other books. I felt it was too drawn out with details that didn't really interest me or seem relevent to the story & found myself skimming over these parts.Storyline was good.
3,Not the best,"I started out really liking this book. As it went on, I found myself skipping parts and eventually was just ready for it to be over. There were so many points of view happening that it was difficult to find myself invested. I didn't care for the prison parts, because some of them went to areas I just didn't want to read about. It wasn't a complete waste of time, but I definitely won't re-read it."
3,"Ok, long winded, lots of characters but a good story","This book was appealing to me because it seemed to have a little bit of everything, like drama, mystery, love etc... All in all, it was an okay story. Different characters give their perspective through the entire book. This book basically takes places in Arizona, and there is ALOT of reference to Native American tradition. It added a lot of uncessary detail. It was interesting, but not needed.Also, there are detailed accounts of the father in jail. I didn't like the way the father is portrayed in jail through these descriptions. It was kind of hard to read those parts.I felt that the story was rushed at the end, which I hate. I don't like when the book is so detailed that the ending winds up being rushed and forced. Despite all of this, it was a good story. Much different from what I am used to, but overall it was okay."
4,Good but not her best,"I love Jodi Picoult's work. Her use of language is exquisite and her attention to detail is amazing. Still, the use of four narrators in this book was troubling for two reasons. Perhaps most importantly, they all spoke with one voice; I often had to go back to figure out who was narrating a particular chapter. Second, all the main characters remained enigmas or, perhaps, simply one or two-dimensional. This book is worth reading but not her best.A bone to pick -- are there no editors around who can tell the difference between subjective and objective pronouns?"
2,Vanishing Acts is disappointing,"I'm a big Picoult fan, but I have to say this book is quite a disappointment. There were too many main characters and they were not fully developed. I thought the one chapter thrown in from Elise's point of view was out of place. The chapters describing Andrew's time in jail added nothing to the story line. I find it hard to believe that Eric would just walk away from Delia and Sophie and not be the least bit angry about what went on with Delia and Fitz. I also find it hard to believe that someone would simply stand by and watch a friend jump off a cliff. There were too many elements of this story that weren't believable. But even though the story was a disappointment, Picoult tells it in such a way that makes the reader want to find out what's next. I always have a hard time putting her books down which is why I will continue to read her novels."
2,Tried to read but couldn't..,This was loaned to me by a co-worker who loved the book. I could not get through it. I tried but couldn't. She could have made this book in half the pages. On and on about her mother and what could have been.
4,Vanishing Acts,"Jodi Picoult never fails to captivate me. In Vanishing Acts, she pulls me in with a story about the past. Delia Hopkin's father is accused of kidnapping her... 28 years earlier. Delia's world is suddenly turned upside-down as she questions the only life she's ever known.This book was great... There aren't really words to describe it, except for powerful. It triggered emotions in me that I never would have thought I had. I found myself sympathizing with Delia, even though I don't relate to her much at all."
4,A New Author,"This is the first Jodi Picoult novel that I have read. Therefore, I have no other Picoult novels to compare the quality of the work. I am quite anxious to read more of her stories because I think that the main theme of the book was really interesting. I hope that the other books of her's that I will read, are also as intriguing. The book may not be perfect, but who is perfect? What I found to be particularly interesting was the idea that every person has good and bad and, hopefully, the good outweighs the bad. You never know why a person reacts a certain way until you walk in their shoes. No one in this book is all good or all bad. The characters are just people with human frailities, like every one of us. I liked the book because it touched me with its uniqueness and sensitivity."
2,Too many story lines,"I have liked this author's books but I was disappointed with this one. The switching of points of view was annoying. The graphic description about Andrew's prison experience and the drug making was unecessary to the theme as was all the Native American business. Those things just slowed down the narrative. If sexual abuse is a motivtor for Andrew's action, it needs to be a definite act which he observed, not just a ""possibility,"" and perhaps introduced or foreshadowed earlier.Jodi Picoult writes well and that kept me reading, but this could have been several novels. Just the kidnapping and its consequences on the relationships would have made a good story."
2,way too long,this book was so dragged out and included so many unnecessary plot lines. I was very disappointed because I had just finished my sister's keeper which I thought was excellent.
3,Very average...,"I haven't read many of Jodi Picoult's books, and after this one I'm not sure I'll read another one. I was over half way done with this and thought, well, if I lose it I won't replace it! I'll admit, the book picked up a little steam after the half way point, but I was very disappointed with the ending.If you don't have anything else to read, this book isn't a total waste of time, but don't set your expectations too high."
2,Disappointment,"I was on my way to buy another book when I spied this latest from Jodi Picoult, an author who I adore. I have read all her books, and when I picked this up, the premise sounded great. Unfortunately, once I opened the book, my anticipation of a great read was quickly quashed. I actually struggled to get through this book-maybe because everything seemed so forced-the Search and Rescue angle, the eccentric Ruthann, the love triangle, even dad's experience in jail. And not to sound uptight but I don't see how it helped the story to have a recipe for drugs in it. I usually pass on my books to my high school students and my friends but not this one. What a disappointment. I will have to wait for the next one."
1,Vanishing Acts,"This book seems to be an example of how big book publishers go with published authors and popular topics, and apparently do not always even read or provide editing for the product. This is a poorly written, poorly edited book that should never have been published.Here's just one example of the triteness and sloppiness:""Being part of his entourage was like the sun coming through a plate-glass window: golden, something to lift your face toward.""The above sentence is not even gramatically correct.The contrived, unbelieveable, silly plot is even worse.My book club chose this book; the time we spent on it was entirely wasted."
2,Not believable,"I read My Sister's Keeper, and enjoyed it. So when I found myself in an airport, I picked this one up because it was the only other Picoult book they had. If I didn't have a thing for having to see the end of bad movies too, I would have stopped about halfway through. I found myself skipping pages of boring history lessons, and I don't think I read anyone the ""raps"" the other reviews talk about. The first person narrative thing, from 4 different people was, at times, very confusing and I would have to skip back a few pages to see who ""I"" was on this page. And every charecter in the book had some very convinient flaw that fit together perfectly like a puzzle. Real life isn't that convinient.Oh, and after reading the other reviews, I'm still trying to figure out what the ""surprise"" twist to the ending was."
1,Disappointing read,"I have read many of Jodi Picoult's books and this one was very disappointing. About halfway through the book, I began to scan pages as I could no longer get through by simply reading. The only reason I kept going was to see what the surprise ending would be; what an extreme disappointment even that turned out to be!"
4,Better than I predicted,"This book was slow to start for me. The characterization was a bit far fetched. But I did get into all the prison details once I got into the meat of the book. I was more interested in what was really going on with everyone. The hidden truth was held out almost to the end. I won't give it away. But it is worth getting through that slow beginning, the more satisfying heart of the book, and finally all the truths at the end. I didn't give it a full 5 stars because it just didn't qualify as a true page turner for me. I was entertained enough though. I wonder if prison life is really that intense... I was amused enough to finish and entertained enough to rate it a 4."
3,Vanishing Acts,"What if everything you believed about your past was false? Delia experiences this strange phenomenon, when she realizes that her childhood was not what it seemed. Her mother was not dead. Memories of another place pop into her memory from time to time. Even the name she has been using is not her real name. All of this is revealed when her father is convicted of kidnapping her as a young child. With the help of her two best friends, her husband and their childhood friend, she strives to discover the truth about her father and about her true identity. What she finds is love.Ms Picoult's books are always filled with characters that are so real, the reader often experiences a sort of kinship with them. The same is true here. Although she once again weaves several plots together to create added suspense, I felt that this storyline was a little less enticing than some others."
4,"It was a bit slow in the begining, but",It picked up fast. It was a great book. The ending was a lot like I expected it to be. I would tell my family and friends about it. Great read!
2,Didn't love it,"This book started out ok, but it definitely was dumbed down - 11 or 12 year old level. I am too stubborn to give up on something once I start however, so kept plodding through this even after I determined it to be a waste of time. It could have been 150 pages shorter, leave out all the native american myticism that didn't fit and I skipped over anyway. I also felt like the descriptions of Andrew's experiences in prison were sooooo fake! Really, who made up those raps?!AND - the change of narrators each chapter was really, really annoying. Most people like to get attached to the main character in a novel but we weren't allowed to, there wasn't even one!"
4,Couldn't put it down...,"This was my first Jodi Picoult in a few years. I'm glad I took a break because despite the great writing, there is a little predictability in her books. Seems there's always a controversial topic, a person who spends time in jail and a court case. However, I got hooked in though, and loved the book."
2,Disappointing,"I have read other Picoult books (Her Sister's Keeper, Body Surfing) and found them pleasant reads, lightweight but well-written. I was disappointed in Vanishing Acts, which is none of those things. It is a common technique to use multiple points of view, but there needs to be one primary, pivotal POV, which should have been that of the daughter. The book is rendered uneven and choppy, however, because Picoult has tipped the balance with too many lengthy, graphic scenes of the father's prison experiences. I am not a squeamish reader but I skipped a lot of those scenes in order to get on with what little plot there was. Bottom line: I did not enjoy the book. I guess I will go back and reread Isabel Allende and Ann Patchett if I want well-crafted plots and excellent writing."
5,Vanishing Acts,Good book....looking forward to reading more by this author....her stories are very realistic and easy to read...I have read several already.
3,Not Picoult's bests,"The story of Delia Hopkins got a little long for me, but all in all, was a good read. Picoult's sense of language always impresses me and the story was a good one. However, the whole Native American part was very boring. Each time I found myself at Ruthann's trailer, I seemed to put the book down and not pick it up for a few days. Delia's father, Andrew, was the most interesting charactor in the book and I had the most empathy for him. I think Picoult's novel, Plain Truth, was on this same level, but My Sister's Keeper was awesome!"
3,Untidy ending undoes wonderful writing,"While my expectations at the conclusion of this story were not that all-loose-ends-must-be-tied...I *did* anticipate a finely written story as this is would....well, deliver. Terrific characters but loads of themes that are either under-developed or meant to be red herrings; Picoult doesn't seem sure what she wants to do with them. Nevertheless, there is genuineness in her intent and devotion to her characters' value in the story. Looking forwar d to reading more of her books."
4,a very good read,"As with all Jodi Picoult's novels, this story involves the reader right from the first chapter. Sure to be enjoyed whether this is your first Jodi Picoult novel or just the most recent one you've read."
3,"An Average Picoult Book.. not her best, but not her worst","This is not one of my favorites of her books. The first time I read it, it really disappointed me, but the second time around, it grew on me a bit. And it really isn't a terrible book, though it feels a bit more incomplete than her books usually do. Mostly because the ending is quite open. . . two major parts of the plot were not really definitively concluded, with some rather alarming lingering thoughts after the pages run out. I don't mind books leaving you unsettled, but since justice is (like always) such a theme in Picoult's books, this is particularly frustrating.It is definitelyl an emotional book, especially in its dealings with alcoholism. Again, Picoult weaves in a Native American theme. The prison sequences are a little stupid and very cliched and also go rather unresolved, as characters are introduced and left hanging as the book ends. All in all, this isn't her finest work, nor is it her worst, but it's close."
2,Vanishing Act,"Jodi Picoult's ""Vanishing Acts"", was well written but the story line left much to be desired in my opinion. It's not a book that I would recommend."
3,Not my favorite by Jodi p.,It's ok. I wasn't upset that I read the book but I didn't love it or really like it either. Ehhh
4,Hard to put down.,This book was hard to put down. I was attached to the characters right away. Great story as usual from Jodi Picoult.
3,Started out well but quickly started to meander ...,"This book started out pretty well but I soon hit a couple of problems - 1) Once the book's big secret is revealed it just seems to plod on and on going nowhere, 2) I didn't like the way it had multiple narrators - the heroine, her two male interests, her father, her mother - I kept having to look back to see who was narrating that particular section and would much rather that the whole thing had been seen from Delia's perspective. It seemed to focus far too much on courtroom/prison scenes, and introducing new eccentric characters instead of concentrating on what really interested me - what had happened in the past to make Andrew act the way he had, and in Delia's attempts to reestablish a relationship with Elise. It was quite well written but halfway through I found myself losing interest and flicking over pages to see if something more exciting happened. I would buy her other books secondhand but not pay full price for them ..."
3,"Interesting, but not Picoult's Best","I was excited to finally read Vanishing Acts. But, although it was a good read, I didn't enjoy it as much as My Sister's Keeper, The Pact, or Plain Truth. I found the jailhouse scenes to be distracting and irrelevant, the alcoholism angle not fully developed, and Delia to be shallow. In all, I wanted more: more plot, more character development.Three stars out of five."
1,Worst of her books,"I LOVED Sister's Keeper but HATED this book. I didn't believe any of the story lines nor relate to any of the characters. I usually love how this author weaves your heart into her own characters, but not this time. Watching a suicide, a girl best friend of two guys chooses one then the other, an upstanding, well-educated, moral senior citizen becomes a drug dealing fighter in prison, and a man is accused of child molestation in a court of law and none of these situations is ever resolved. I rarely write reviews but I felt it was worth warning others not to waste their time."
2,Less might have been better,"Sometimes less is better. I rented the audio book from the library and found myself zoning out.Each scene, emotion and character is overly described for my taste. By omitting much of the redundant description, the book might have held my attention. With such a potentially interesting story idea, it's a shame that it got buried in excess verbiage."
2,"Eh, She's Done Better","I have been dying for Picoult to come out with something since I read My Sister's Keeper. However, I was REALLY disappointed with this book. I just didn't get it. Of course in true Picoult style the last several pages are brilliant, but it strongly lacks everywhere else. There are too many silly coincidences and unpractical plot twists. A dad who just happens to know how to make crystal meth??? I hope we get something better next time."
5,GREAT book,I really enjoyed reading this book and couldn't put it down. It was very thought provoking. I recommend you read this book if you are a Jodi Picoult fan.
5,Another great book by Jodi Picoult,"Suspenseful, sensitive issues, not at all predictable, great reading...all the things that make Picoult's books worth reading!! You'll spend many rewarding, enjoyable hours getting completely absorbed by this book!"
2,Not One of Picoult's Best,"I have read about 8 of Picoult's books so far with some of my favorites being Plain Truth, House Rules, and Sing You Home. This is not one of her best. The time at the Trailer Park bored me to death, at times I found myself skipping sections because what did not bore me, did not seem to make a lot of sense. The most interesting part to me was Andrew's time in Prison which surprisingly other reviews said they did not like. It kept me reading, but more so because I wanted to know what the outcome of the case was."
3,Let's just say I'm glad this wasn't my first Picoult,"After trudging through the first 260 pages I had to stop reading. I didn't think I could stand another 150 pages of it, especially when she has many others that are a lot better.I'm not sure what, exactly, bothered me so much. More of a combination of things, really. The font changes from character to character, every scene that Ruthann was in, maybe even the entire plot. Once they got to Arizona, I felt it got worse. If there had been less Ruthann, less Southwest, and maybe more of the legal aspects, I would have enjoyed it more. Then again...maybe that's exactly what happens in the next 150 pages."
2,Disappointing,"I totally agree with some of the other reviews. I am a huge fan of Picoult's, and was really looking forward to this new book. The story is that of Cordelia Hopkins whose father gets arrested for having kidnapped her when she was a child.The problem with this book is that they are lots of main characters, most of which add absolutely nothing to the main storyline. Picoult spends numerous chapters describing horrendous conditions in an Arizona jail and the life of old Native American lady dying of cancer. While they were interesting, they were a waste of time in that they added nothing to the main story.In addition, Picoult's description of Cordelia's relationship with her future ex-husband and future husband are pretty unrealistic, which is really disappointed as Picoult usually gets feelings and relationships right to a t.If you want to read a really good Picoult book, read My Sister's Keeper or The Pact, but not Vanishing Acts."
3,Jodi Picoult...The Next M. Night Shyamalan,"The book held my interest, and I especially liked the prison chapters, but I kept feeling that Jodi Picoult was going the way of M. Night Shyamalan...the first few being interesting, then the next few seeming contrived and predictable. I probably won't read another one of her books, unless my book club picks it."
3,Got through it,"I have read three other Jodi Picoult books and absolutely hands down loved them...(The Pact, Change of Heart, and Handle with Care) This one just wasnt as good....So if its going to be the first you read of her I would choose something different so that you can become familiar with her style of writing..."
4,"Exactly what I expected; no more, no less.","This is the third Jodi book I have read (the first was Nineteen Minutes, the second Change of Heart). I knew that there would be a courtroom drama with people emotionally involved with each other, a story arc that takes place in jail, some OMG plot twists dropped in here or there, and a lot of descriptions of feelings.The four stars were given because that sums up this book in the proverbial nutshell; Jodi has this down to a science. Why not five stars despite the fact that I read the book in about five days? Because it seems that Jodi follows a recipe to write her books; she must have a checklist of how to construct her books. Why not three stars or less? Because she does it so well."
2,So much carelessness!,"I only read this because our book discussion group chose it. Many of us were amazed at the inconsistencies and errors in the book. The major error (that seemed to be a case of sloppiness on the author's part) was the age difference of the main characters. If Delia is 32 and her mother gives her age as 47 when she is sworn in at Andrew's trial, then Andrew was guilty of something worse than kidnapping. Marrying and/or getting a 15 year old pregnant would have landed him in Sheriff Joe's jail long before he had a chance to kidnap Delia. Also, it is Sedona that has red earth, not the Hopi reservation. There was so little focus in this novel. Too many issues: parental kidnapping, alcoholism, Hopi creation myths, violent jail conditions, sexual abuse, repressed memories. Pick one or two or three, not everything in the kitchen!"
5,Fantastic Novel!,"Delia Hopkins makes a living finding missing people. She lives a happy life with her father, her young daughter and her fiance. Suddenly, Delia is forced to uncover truths about a past that she never knew existed. Jodi Picoult is one of the most talented novelists writing today. She so deeply researches her novels, that every reader walks away from her books having learned something unexpected. She keeps her readers interested and never dissappoints. VANISHING ACTS is a fantastic novel."
2,Disappointing,"I have never read one of Picoult's books but my friends enjoy her writing. I thought the plot was thin, characters were trite, and in general did not feel the story line was very sophisticated. The dialogue was not well written in a way that I like. I don't know that I would read another Picoult book if this is her writing style."
2,Interesting plot but uninteresting storytelling,"Vanishing Acts, as in all books by Jodi Picoult, sounds very interesting if you pick up the book and read the dust jacket. She has amazingly original plots, but the story always seems to stand still. This author focuses a lot on the characters and describing their feelings separately rather than weaving their stories together. This is evident as she devotes each chapter to separate characters to fully focus her writing to only that character's feelings and emotions. This leaves one wondering whether she can write about more than one character at a time. Overall, the story is very interesting but the way she tells it is very...blah"
3,"After My Sister's Keeper, A Disappointment","My Sister's Keeper was the first book I read by Jodi Picoult. While MSK was a page turner, Vanishing Acts had a hard time keeping my attention. It seemed to be full of ""filler."" That is, it trailed off time after time, to come back to the story. The only interesting character was the Indian woman (though I don't understand her significance). A book with her as the main character would have been better. With most of the action in the last 1/8 of the book, it took an awfully long time to get there. Further, the ending was such a disappointment (Andrew deserves a slap in the face). In the end, I really cannot recommend this book."
3,This book is AVERAGE for Jodi Picoult,"Maybe I have been spoiled by having my first Jodi Picoult Novel be My Sister's Keeper and my second novel, Second Glances, both extremely enjoyable thought-provoking novels. Vanihing Acts, though, did not impress me in the same way. I was unsympathetic with a few of the characters and found Eric and Delia to be grating. The centering idea of the novel was interesting still though but could have been thought out more, it seemed rushed. The best part of this novel were Andrew. When compared to Jodi's previous work I find it only to be average but it still better than many other recent novels by different authors."
4,Not Quite Finished,"I am about two hundred pages into Vanishing Acts. Started off great, read through those first two hundred pages in a flash. I am starting to get into the whole Arizona Native American writings and they bore me, I want to get on with what the story is. A part of me believes Jodi Picoult felt she needed this to make this book longer. But I am finding myself skipping over alot of stuff to get to the story. IF I were to recommend this to someone tomorrow, I would be absoulutely sure to mention the often boring Arizona descriptions."
5,Truly Excellent,"For those of us who feel that The One is probably John/Taupin's best release since their 70's pinnacle, you won't go wrong here.The Barcelona concert perfectly illuminates a unique show (Versache's famous involvement), with excellent song selection. The 5.1 sound mix is fair (but the PCM sound choice is not as good). The documentary is also very interesting."
5,ELTON AT HIS BEST,"ELTON JOHN IN BARCELONA IS A FIVE FOR ME FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. ELTON IS PLAYING HIS CLASSICS ALONE WITH BACK UP BAND AND SINGERS THAT ARE GREAT AND THE CROWD IN BARCELONA IS INTO THE ENTIRE CONCERT. I LIKE THIS ELTON WITHOUT THE COSTUMES AND STAGE SHOW. HE IS TOO GOOD OF A SONG WRITER FOR THAT. ITS FUNNY BUT I REALLY NEVER LIKED THE SONG ""PHILADELPHIA FREEDOM"" BUT THE REPRODUCTION LIVE ON THIS IS REALLY GOOD. ""BURN DOWN THE MISSION"" IS A GREAT VERSION AND NEVER HAS GOTTEN ITS FAIR BILLING AS A GREAT SONG. MONA LISA...TERRIFIC. AND OF COURSE ""FUNERAL FOR A FRIEND/LOVE LIVES BLEEDING IS REPRODUCED VERY WELL. I FIND IT FUNNY THAT ONE OF THE REVIEWERS THAT GAVE IT A ONE STAR FOR PRODUCTION AND SOUND MUST BE LISTENING ON A OLD 8 TRACK BECAUSE THE SOUND AND PICTURE QUALITY IS EXCELLANT. AS A PLUS THE 55 MINUTE DOCUMENTARY IS VERY INTERESTING. BUY THIS, SIT BACK AND ENJOY, CRANK IT UP WITH SOME FRIENDS AND ENJOY A GREAT DVD CONCERT."
4,Perfect performance but....,"Great concert,great location all my favorites songs Elton John At his peak But an Annoying fluctuation in audio level during the fine rendition of funeral for a friend ruined it for Me."
4,Even better live,"Whoever the guy was who said he saw them live and they sucked is delusional. It took me a while to get into the CD, but now it's on repeat in my CD player and this band rocks live. They get the crowd going and have unbelievable energy. How can a pop rock performance with a light show and a bubble machine go wrong? It is pop rock with a electronic bent, though, so if you don't like that, you won't like them. ""Messy"" is one of the best songs on the album."
1,Owed to Horace,"This may be a fine book of translation but on the whole it is not poetry. Compare versions of any ode translated by Alexander and Ferry and you'll see: Alexander is working with language, Ferry is working with poetry. If you want Horace's poetry, buy the Ferry text."
3,Amusing easy reader,"A young girl holds a tea party for her dog and their stuffed friends. Her older brother and his friend are seen in the background laughing together at her detailed arrangements, but when the cookies are brought out, they decide they can't be left out any longer.Great for a new reader."
4,Fits well enough and doesn't look bad.,I picked this up for my 2007 Frontier. It fit well and the small pocket under the radio slot is nice for slipping in the iPod connector or remote for my radio. It sinks the radio down farther than I would like. On the Frontier there is a hard pipe behind where the radio is and getting the radio to stay down wasn't easy. My standard sized stereo touches this pipe and I had to bend out the tabs on the sides of the radio and screw down the mount in order to get it to stay in there well. I knocked off a star for this. All in all though this will fit and should work well for you. You don't have a lot of options(either this or the Scoche one from what I can tell) and I think this is the better one.
4,Easy to catch...difficult to throw,"I personally found this frisbee not as easy to throw as the regular frisbee. It is very easy to catch, however, due to the rubberized edge, which is why I purchased it. We are still happy with the frisbee over all, it is just a different experience from the standard frisbee, which is just fine, we take both to the park with us."
5,the best in the business,I purchased my first Aerobie disc 13 years ago and this product is my 1st (and only) choice in flying discs. They are the Bugatti Veyrons of the frisbee world - bottom line! You will not be disappointed.
4,1800 Miles of Fine Music,"Audrey has a smooth, confident and professional sound. There is rock, pop along a touch of latin soul--enough to please most everyone. The only downside? There may be 1800 miles, but only eight songs. Let's hear more from this wonderful artist."
5,Must own if you believe,"Well written, well organized and beautifully illustrated. The information about dreams and merging it with Tarot cards gives more insight into the issues and meaning in dreams. Easy to ready and easy to apply. The glossory of symbols and their meaning in the back simplifies looking up symbols.Each Tarot cards is illustrated with explanations. One Tarot card per page. This one is a keeper with extra editions to give away to special friends."
2,Disappointing,"I looked forward eagerly to receiving this book, hoping for some new ideas to use. When I finally received it, I was very disappointed. Over half of the book was devoted to yet another list of not particularly different or original card meanings. This series from Llewellyn is supposed to be for non-beginners and this material frankly seemed a waste of space. I did not find any new or interesting tidbits for my tarot practice in this book.Overall, this series from Llewellyn is excellent and well worth buying but this book came across as a good idea that was not sufficiently thought-through and did not have enough originality."
4,Good Effort from Nick and the Boys,"A very good album from Nick and the Flip Tops. If you have not heard Nick Moss before you are in for a treat. He has a great way of putting a fresh spin on the traditional Chicago blues sounds. This album takes a while to get going, but the back half is great. If you can only buy one Nick album I would recommend Sadie Mae, which has a more mature sound and better production quality. Also check out the great 'Got a New plan' cd. Looking for some fresh new blues that is fanatsic look no further. Keep an eye out for Nick, he is the real deal."
5,Beach Music Anthology Chairmen of the Board,Service was excellent. CD was sent within 1 week. The CD is a great compilation of the best of the Chairmen of the Board. It is great. Every fan of the late General Johnson should have this one in their collection.
3,a little disappointed,I was a little disappointed with this CD. I expected it to have more beach type music than it did.
4,A fiery mix of intense original jazz,"Cal Scott offers a fiery mix of intense original jazz. He is a double-threat performer on both Pat Martino-inspired guitar and smooth, soulful trumpet passages."
3,"Nice kettle, way too heavy","This kettle looks great, but it's way too heavy. I bought this as a gift for my mom and there's no way she'll be able to lift this empty, let alone with boiling water in it. Now I will have to spend a fortune to have it sent back."
1,Great Single Use Bag,Second time we openedthe bags the top tore off. No longer useable.Buy ziplock bags or go up to the more expensive water tight bags and boxes. I feel they are a waste of money.
3,T Double D unleashed!,Follow Trick Daddy on an unbelievable ride as he invites you behinds the scenes of the craziest moments during the recording of the Thug Holiday album. Look out for quest appearences by some of the industry's biggest artist.
1,Do not buy from ELECTRONICA DIRECT!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am a second UNHAPPY customer with scrued vacation, because camera came with NO BATTERY ( Battery pack is shown in the second image)! Why nowhere in the Detail section is not mention what "" BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED"", and what is no where to find them in USA ! It was a Christmas present for child, next day after Christmas, we left for vacation and were not able to use camera!!!!!!!!The seller ELECTRONICA DIRECT is totally ignoring me, I filled claim through amazon.com and waiting for oustcome"
3,Funny,"Moms Mabley steals the show. From the beginning to the end, this movie will keep you laughing. It is funny, heartwarming, and amazing! Of course, by todays' standard of moviemaking, this would be considered a flop, but considering the year in which it was produced and released, this is a delightful movie."
5,GREAT MOVIE!,"I am so glad I purchased this movie. It is Moms Mabley at her finest. I had never seen her acting and here she does a great job.If you love and miss Moms Mabley, here is a chance to see and hear her once again in a great role.She is definitely Amazing Grace!"
3,dragggggggggssssssssss,if it wasn't for the supporting actors this movie would've sucked. Ms mabley is a horrible actress.
2,Port & Company Vest,First size I ordered was too small and I exchanged them. Second ones didn't fit really well but I decided to keep them but I'm not particularly happy with them. They are not very well made.
4,Wonderful retrospective!!!,"I recently saw the Otis Redding exhibit at the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in Macon. This DVD offers full length performances from his concerts and tv appearances through his brilliant career. I especially enjoyed the interviews with Zelma Redding, his widow, and Steve Cropper. I was disappointed that the DVD lacked interview footage of Otis along with biographical information. Other than that, it's great entertainment and a good value. I strongly recommend the ""Stax/Volt Revue Live In Norway 1967"" DVD as a companion which features Otis in concert with Eddie Floyd, Arthur Conley, Sam & Dave, and Booker T. and the M.G.'s."
4,Great Historic Data,I have always been an Otis Redding fan. The videos and commentary were great and brought back a lot of memories. I was dancing all over the house with some songs and a lot of emotion with others. This is an excellent DVD to add to your collection for all of the OR fans.
4,THE LOVE MAN,THIS IS SUCH AN EXCITING DOCUMENTARY! IT HAS A GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN OTIS' PERFORMANCES AND COMMENTARIES FROM THOSE THAT WERE CLOSE TO HIM IN HIS LIFE AND CAREER. THE FOOTAGE OF THE GREAT ONE'S PERFORMANCES BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES FROM OVER 40 YEARS AGO & WHY I FELL IN LOVE WITH OTIS AS A YOUNGSTER. THE FILM WAS NOT TOO SHORT BUT IT WAS SO GOOD THAT IT LEFT ME HUNGERING FOR MORE OF OTIS. HOW SAD THAT HE WAS CUT OFF FROM US WHEN HE WAS: I GUESS GOD WANTED HIM FOR HIS HEAVENLY CHOIR.
5,The Big O,This is a great retrospective. Let's you into Otis' world and lets you see the effect he had on those around him and on Stax Records. I just wish the survivors of the Barkays were in on it. I would like to hear their storie.
5,Simply Excellent!,"Reelin' In The Years has done it again! While there have been several incarnations of Otis Redding's Monterey Pop performance available on video and the Ready! Steady Go! Special was briefly around during the Betamax days, this compilation unearths a trasure trove of rare and previously unseen TV appearances. The biggest surprises are 3 Songs performed on The Beat!!! show that are not on the Bear Family reissues (!!!) and a full color promo for ""Tramp"" showing Otis goofing around on his ranch and outside his offices in Memphis. It's unfortunate they couldn't include Otis' lip-sync of Respect from ""Murray The K"" but they do include it recorded live and in color from his last TV appearance. Memories by family and friends and add to the love. This would be a ""must-own"" at any price. The fact that Stax has made it so affordable should encourage you to pick up the Live Stax/Volt Tour and Respect Yourself DVDs as well. 11/10"
1,"CD: ""Dream to Remember: The Otis Redding Legacy""",This product will not play on any cd playing device. Product link not available.
4,Good overview of imaging techniques,"This book gives a clear, usable overview of many imaging techniques currently in use for medical imaging. It is not for laymen, as it delves into the mathematical basis for the techniques. However, for an engineer there is a satisying amount of detail with a concise overview."
5,Great Product!,"Love this, doesnt have an odor and anything with OPI on it - I believe is a great product to own."
5,I love it,I use nothing but OPI nail polish so I use this polish remover. It works great and doesn't hurt my nails.
2,Edgy,"These concertos sound as tortured as their composer, soon to enter a mental asylum. Storgards' choppy edgy phrasing is uncomfortable to listen to; however, I imagine even the best players today couldn't make these sows' ears into silk--hence the dearth of recordings."
4,J. Rhodes is my teacher.,"J. Rhodes or Coach Rhodes as she is known to us, her students is a very good writer and an amazing teacher. I think the book, The King Boy paints a perfect picture of life in a small southern town and shows some of the hardships along the way. This book is truly amazing as is Coach Rhodes,she has inspired many people in her career."
3,not nice to mess with mother nature,"the deadly deep is a quick and easy read. it is the type of story that roger corman would make into a b-movie. lots of action, lite dialogue and some t&a to spice things up. the story is about some dna testing done on killer whales (!). not a good idea. soon we have whales, bass, tuna, crabs and octopuses all attacking and killing people. the action in this thriller is brisk, plentiful and a bit silly. fishes pushing over boats will definately make your eyes roll. anyway, if you're into nature-gone-wrong, or books by peter benchley, you'll probably like this read. just don't read it close to the water!"
2,Wasted time!,"Creative Labs was the originator who brought both sound and CD-ROMs to the home computer, so I thought they would be a great brand to start creating CDs with. I was oh so wrong! I am a Windows 98 user with a Hewlett Packard computer and 64 MB of RAM, and with all of this I still had great difficulty in creating CDs. First off, if you want a CD Audio disc made, it puts 2 second gaps between the tracks ALWAYS! Making it non compatable with top CD making software like Easy CD Creator. Then, its also very difficult to even get it to burn a data CD without errors and the most aggrivating part of it is that half of the time it will not even recognize a CD is in the drive! Tech support is quite bad for the product as well, they send you documents to answer your question via email instead of live help."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This is a huge waste of money, and I did not even think that they still sold this product. I bought this about a year ago since I trusted Creative, but I guess I shouldn't have. First of all I would like to say I received 150 cds as a gift from different people all of the same brand. They would work fine on a friends burner but this burner said it did not even recognize that there was a cd in the burner...The only type of cd that would work was fujifilm. Now it does this for every cd and will not recognize ANY type of cd (blank, cds I made, nor software or music cds). It just makes this high pitch whistle. I am very disappointed"
1,Horrible - Don't Buy One!,Worst drive I've ever used. Stutters and stumbles whether reading or writing. Burns plenty of coasters. When it does record it won't read it's own discs. Often won't even read a pre-recorded disc. It's a piece of junk. I don't recommend it at all.
2,Shabby burner,It is not so bad on XP now but on 2000 it was a nightmare. It will only really work with Nero ...It's still slow and it staggers when playing games. Also your cd-roms are very hot when they get out!!
2,"Below average, better buy another brand","I purchased the product partly because of the low price. I could write a few CD's under Win 98 (sometimes the program just stopped running, and I had to turn off the computer, then turned on again to remove the disk--to throw it away). But I had a HD crash, and I switched to Win NT 4. Since then, I have had problems using Nero. It could not write on CDR, (honestly, very rarely it could write, but afterwards when the CD is read, it is really slow, or none at all). My tentative conclusion is that the software (Nero) is not quite compatible with Win NT4 (an update from .... I installed did not solve the problem). I plan to buy another brand-name product in the near future to replace the unused Blaster CDRW, in which the writing software is not Nero."
2,Save Your Money,"I purchased this 8432 model and found little support online from Creative. The software that comes with it is junk at best. Nero Buring. I tried to install Abtec software it doesn't support this model either. By the way Creative has made three models of the 8432. So I purchased a Plextor 10/12/32 that comes with the abtec software and it is GREAT. Buring copy's, copying files and backing up software, it is so easy to operate. By the way I am running Windows ME. Don't waste your money on this Model 8432. Spend the extra forty bucks and get something that will do the job for you and supports Abtec Buring software."
2,It works but nothing more.,"It works just fine with the Nero software which comes with it (Nero is good software), however the following software does not work with this CD-RW (EZ CD Creator, Music Match, MP3CD and I'm sure there are more.) So right now I rate it 4 stars since the Nero software can do everything I need to do, but it has been reduced to 2 star due to extremely poor, almost non-existing support for Creative Labs. My last Creative Labs Product."
4,Great characters.,I like the colorful scenery and am getting attached to the people. Plots aren't very complicated. But the writing is good.
3,Great material - Poor technical quality,"My review goes counter to Abraham's advice but there must, in my book, be a place for positive criticism.My question is, Jerry and Esther how can you let such poorly filmed material be released in your names? The camera work is out of focus more than it is in - and I don't just mean a little soft but really badly focussed, as if by amateurs who don't know how to use the equipment. One of the cameras on Esther is obviously on too long a lense to be of any use - it constantly flits in and out of focus and suffers from vibration; but even the stage cameras on the questioner are not immune from focus problems and they are not any distance away so they have no excuse.Please E&J; - you must have plenty of funds available to you to have your workshops properly filmed by professional crews...."
2,mis-representation,Missing parts and package had been previously opened; even though the product was sdvertised as 'new.
2,Not true to Wodehouse character,1. Characters not Wodehouse. Plots not of type in books. Jeeves portrayed as idiot.2. Second film no Bertie Wooster
3,ok for gift but...,"ok for gift but...the overall condition of the majorparts is good but it's the smaller things that i dislike about this item.one of the bell balls + tassle had broken off of the chime (the tassle also broken appart and in a messy knot). the chimed is held together by several flimsy puny key rings, which look as if they've been used prior to the chime. They don't even match color wise (chimes are broze-ish like in the photo, but the rings are silver... come on! some effort please!). it doesn't help that it came in a smashed box within a box now does iti'm not going to return it because it is a gift... and i don't have the time..."
4,Great cover to protect your tiny camera,"I have found that the DSC-T7 to be almost too small to handle, but with this water resistant case, it actually was just the right size to easily handle in an active environment. The case provides access to all the cameras functions. I gave my camera and this case the ultimate test- would it survive Burning Man? It managed perfectly and I got great pictures and movies with a camera that was small enough to hang around my neck without feeling to bulky. The only complaint is that the water resistant seal is very limited. I dropped the camera into the water and the shock of hitting the surface caused it to leak slightly."
2,Good looking but not a good cutter,"I bought some of these for cheap from Lee Valley. They're well fitted together and very solid feeling, but they're not good steak knives. The knives are dull and since they are cheap stamped stainless steel, they cannot be sharpened. The amount of serration is very awkward, too little to work as a serrated knife, but no longer useful as a flat edged knife. They're also big - maybe the right size for cutting porterhouses or a full rack of ribs, but too big otherwise.They make decent utility knives, and that's what I use them for. I paid $1.25 each and use them for transplanting plants and cutting cardboard. This knife has the right amount of serration for those tasks.For cheap steak knives, I'd suggest the 4 inch Forschner paring knives. They don't look as good but they stay very sharp for years and cuts effortless through any kind of meat."
5,For kids from 5 to 50,"This is a detailed book on every kind of animal (small lizards to elephants, lots of birds.) With a lot of pictures and selective paraphrasing from a few captions, it would entertain a four-year-old, yet there's enough detail a high school kid could use it for term papers. Great bargain. Big, beautiful, dense book."
4,Great book,"What an awesome, informative &educational book for my 6 y/o grandson to have for many years of learning. ANd I thoroughly enjoyed looking at it & learning so much."
5,Brilliant!,"How can we judge a film just because you can't understand the spoken language(yes English)? The setting or the circumstances of the event, never mind the part about the CD's additional features (I laughed at that one). Yet those who complain do so with so disparity missing the point the film so obviously portrays. This was a fantastic work of self-discovery but most of all love, and what it can do to a person's state of mind. It would be very inane of me to try and explain why, but the fill can do it on its own. If you are not afraid to admit the realities of life, then this film should be in the top shelf of your collection."
4,Borstal Boy,"This gem caught me by surprise, not having heard of it before.It always amazes me how English (Irish) movies have such fine acting...the ring of truth abounds in this feel-good love story.I watched again and again, each time tears abounding.Another surprise is the theme song written by Peter O'toole and performed by Hot House Flowers...Excellent and touching. Highly recommended for the open-minded viewer seeking a warm, unusual love story."
4,pretty good Irish film,"(i'm 13)this story is about a boy of about 16 who is in the IRA named Brandon Behan and gets caught smuggling guns and explosives to London and gets sent 2 Borstal correction center 4 youths or somethin like that. While in Borstal he encounters his inner demons and befrends a gay sailor. at first they r just friends cause ya kno....the guy's gay and got alot of heat from the other guys and needed a friend. But as time goes on Brandon's feelings for the boy become stronger(i 4got his name sorry) and he begins 2 discover homesexuality. but he also has passion for a girl...who is the daughter of the sort of ''warden'' of Borstal. but anyways i liked this movie and if you like romance, drama and a little Irish history then you'd like this"
2,More cliche's than one should handle,"What a pity. This film could have been brilliant, but the writers betrayed the books. Certainly, Hatosy's portrayal is excellent and underrated. But, the film company has made a great effort to present this as a gay film. Yes, there is some queer content, as the hero discovers his bisexual feelings for a gay sailor. But, like in the films and books of old, his love is doomed and the gay character must be punished with death. While this may actually have happened, the screenwriter and director could have focused on the positive instead of making bisexuality seem like a burden that robs one of all love.Additionally, there are many events that transpire that could be watched in any teen movie from the 1980s - the headmaster's daughter, the game that brings mates together, and so forth.What could have been a brilliant film that sought to understand bisexuality instead squelched understanding and went for sentimentality."
3,Borstal Boy,"Enjoyed the ""hsitory"" aspect of this story, recalling losses so many experienced in World War II. BUT HOW WE NEED SUBTITLES. Usually don't have a problem with English gay movies - or any British or Irish accent - but this one is really difficult to understand at times."
5,Good movie,"This was a great movie. The cover says it is heart-warming, and that is true. The love story was realistic, I believed it would happen like this. I I even felt like I was there at one point. Usually, Strand Releasing movies are horribly boring, and poorly done, but not this one."
2,Pice is good but quality is poor,Fits to the phone perfectly. But Swivel clip is not comfortable.I wont' recommend this product.
3,This is the second one..,I keep breaking these for some reason. Not sure if it's cheap plastic or what.
3,One problem,"The phone clip was great, and was very little money, but when I got them they did not fit my sony erricson phone, and my only other option was to go through all the trouble of returning it."
4,If only they fit...,Amazon Garage said these would fit my 1998 bmw 528i (e39) and yet upon trying to install I found myself with the wrong sized pads. Returned them and will be requesting a full refund since it was Amazon who claimed they would fit my car. My mechanic friend really likes this brand and highly recommended them but these pads simply did not fit.
4,Vintage Only,"This is a very good reference for vintage structures, but be aware that it mainly covers the vintage era (pre-1973) with only a few select items up to 1975 or so. Still looking for that perfect reference book for those collecting Barbies from 1973 on..."
3,interesting and attractive carpet catalogue,This book is a catalogue of an exhibition held the the Textile Museum (Washington) in 1975. The first part discusses the design and construction of early Caucasian carpets. This is followed by illustrations and annotations of the 37 rugs that were on display. These items are of a very high quality and the author Charles Grant Ellis was a distinguished carpet scholar and writer. The 16 full page color illustrations are very good considering the age of this publication. The balance of the photographs are in monotone; while giving an impression of the patterns of the rugs they are distinctly inferior by not being in color. I note that this collector's piece presently has a high asking price; I would shop around as I doubt if it is worth that much. Recommended for specialists in this area.
5,Reversing Diabetes,This is an excellent book for someone seeking a natural way to treat diabetes. The knowledge has helped me to control my diabetes.
4,another and another,"this book, well written as it is, is just another in the thousands of books ""curing"" a horrible disease.that being said, the best fight we can use against diabetes is to stop eating processed food, canned food and junk food.yeah, i bought two.....and they do make some sense."
3,Informative but don't misread the carb-focused part,"I found alot of the facts in this book very informative and interesting, especially the part about how the presence of insulin prevents the release of fat mobilizing(weight loss) hormones. I was determined after reading a good part of the book to start eating lots of low glycemic carbs and stop eating a high protein and fat and low carb diet. Well, I soon found myself starving with high blood sugars. (I started out high.) I found my blood sugar didn't take a negative slope unless I restricted my caloric intake to 1300 calories. (For an active 6'2"" guy that's starving.) I then read Syndrome X by Burkeson and it balanced and helped me better understand the facts in this book. This book is great for understanding how you became and stayed overweight, and the ins and outs of insulin resistance and diabetes. This is definitely a must read, just balance it with other literature."
5,Incredible Eye-Opener !!,"After being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, my doctor immediatley put me on oral medication, even PRIOR to seeing a diabetic specialist!. Was I given expanations ? NO! was I offered other alternatives? NO! My wife began to dig into this disease and began to notice that by weight control and diet, diabetes can be controlled. It was refreshing to read this book to confirm our beliefs. We now eat well and excercise, my diabetes in getting in control! NO Medication! Yes eating well and excercise are hard work, but I feel my Wife and Children are worth the improved health !!Best luck to all !! Don't give up !!"
5,IMPORTANT FOR ALL DIABETICS!,"When I was told about the book, Reversing Diabetes, I was in disbelief! Diabetes can be REVERSED?!? Dr. Whitaker's simple, straight-forward explanation taught me so much about the disease I had just been diagnosed with! I would strongly recommend following his suggestions regarding supplements and vitamins! I was one who never even took a daily vitamin! WOW!!! What a huge difference these supplements and vitamins make in the way I feel...and am able to control my diabetes! GREAT BOOK! Every diabetic should have this book close at hand!"
1,GOOD GRIEF!!!!!,"I know the medical association and the dietary associations follow suit, but advocating a ""low-fat, high fiber, hi carb"" diet is EXACTLY why we have sky-rocketing Diabetes.If you really want to find out how to deal with Diabetes, head to the book by a man that is NOW a Dr, with type 1, yes TYPE ONE diabetes, and he keeps it under control, and not this Charlatan that is supported by all our ""experts"" that ignore WHAT diabetes IS.Try Dr. Bernstein instead.He will talk reality to you."
3,reversing diabetes,I didn't like the advice in the book..also a bit hard to read. This didn't seem that interesting to me.
5,The Title Delivers As Promised,"As a newly diagnosed diabetic I was looking for just the solution the title offered - I wanted to reverse this insidious disease before it wrecked my life.Guess what, it did just that.I followed the regimen very closely and I do not take any oral medications much less insulin by injection.I had rather keep this mess at bay with diet, exersize and supplements.And they are all meticulously itemized in this great book."
5,It Works!,"I found the book to be informative on many things I hadn't known, including helping me understand the mechanism of diabetes itself. Clear, simple language made it a lot easier than I thought it would be.I followed the menus and recipes completely, which turned out to be somewhat difficult as i had never previously used so much fresh produce, and it takes longer to prepare than tossing something in the microwave or stopping in at a fast food place. I was never hungry, however, and my craving for sweets disappeared during the first couple of weeks.It has a great resource section.The single most important thing about the book? It worked for me."
4,Fact or fiction,As a diabetic I found the information interesting. The author was patting himself on his back abit to often. I had a hard time understanding his examples. It was like useing the word your defining as an example. Over all the book contained pertenant information.The book also offered good advice and warnings about the drugs and the food we eat.
1,amazon: ripoff extraordinary,"book was quoted to me at one price, billed at a higher price. i cancelled order but amazon shipped it any way.i couldn't understand return instructions so i wrote amazon twice. weeks have gone by with no response.i got in touch with dhl and they instructed me how to return book. good thing cause amazon couldn't be bothered.i returned the unopened package. the box was crushed so badly dhl couldn't scan the shipping label.haven't heard a word from amazon until this review solicitation.bottom line is don't do business with amazon they are a ripoff and are clueless as how to properly do business.thank you for you time"
3,Heavy Reading,"The first two thirds of this book contain everything known by Dr. Julian Whitaker (and it is a lot!) about diabetes -- the history, the research, previous attempts at control, effects of medicinal solutions. If you're a ""I must know"" type, then read, read, read. However, if you want to get to 'the program', skip directly to Chapter 13; ""How to Implement the Diet for Reversing Diabetes."" A friend who has successfully followed this program says that Dr. Whitaker's cookbook [ASIN:0446691410 Reversing Diabetes Cookbook: More Than 200 Delicious, Healthy Recipes]] is the better way to go. Wish I had started there!"
4,mechanics stethoscope,Always wanted to purchase one and it lived up to my expectations. Was able to isolate and repair a knocking sound coming out of my engine.
3,The Faith Of The Christian Church: An Introduction To Theology,"Bought it for someone else - didn't read it - got tired of the ""please review"" emails."
5,Get this DVD for cheaper...,"Okay, if you are like me and freaked out over this insane price than do what I did :) I went to ebay and got this whole season and season 4 only paying 77$ total.Pokemon is part of my childhood but this price is ridiculous, go to Ebay. That's the only time Ebay is better than amazon. Other than that Amazon rules ;)"
3,German expellee 's view,"My ancestors left Germany in the mid 1700's to settle in eastern parts of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Through wars, Mongol and Turkish attacks we hung on.In 1945 we were fleeing ahead of the Russian armies as they destroyed everything in their path, until meeting the American armies heading east. Many in our village were shot or hauled off to Siberia as slave labor. As a youngster, I experienced the poverty and lack of food millions of refugees suffered.Readers should be aware of the inherent bias of both Ambrose and Bischof as they are employees of the Eisenhower Center. In a subsequent book, CRIMES AND MERCIES, Drawing on newly released secret Soviet documents,Bacque refutes many of Bishop and Ambrose's objections.This is a must read as it completes the picture of the destruction and rebuild of Germany."
4,Another side of the events,I lived one mile from Pilot Grove and the stories I heard were different but interesting. This area has a rich history and it is good to here another side of the story.
5,Lovely Book,"If you have a soft spot in your heart for man's best friend and love to hunt, this book is a must-read. The relationship the author has with his dogs can only be understood by those that have experienced the same with their own dogs."
4,car cover,"Covercraft Ready-Fit Spunbond 100 Series Long Car Cover , Grayvery happy with product. Very easy to remove/put on. Saves the car exterior from many of the weather elements, tree sap, etc."
1,DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COVER!,"I would never recommend this cover to anyone. It is very cheaply made and of poor quality material. Within one month of putting it on our car, the squirrels had eaten huge holes in it and had shredded the entire top of the car part of the cover as well as other smaller parts of the cover."
3,Just got it - haven't opened box - have to laugh,"One side of the box shows 300 different cars but this company makes only FIVE sizes!I'm torn between opening the box and trying it on my 95 J30T and just returning it.I'm laughing because when I bought it on Amazon the website has a ""make sure it fits"" wizard.Even asked me if it's a J30 or a J30T (small spoiler in back is exterior difference).FIVE SIZES and your asking me if it's a J30 or J30T? - Please. I guess a car cover thatfits snuggly is going to cost mucho bucks. As one reviewer noted - You get what you pay for.I'll probably return it sight unseen but still chuckling on how I got kind of snookered.Shame on Amazon :-)P.S. If I open the box I will provide follow-up review."
5,Self study,I was already familiar with it. I Ordered it for reference and self study. Well written and easy to follow.
5,James Bond Rocks!,Bought my dad this for a gift. He loves James Bond. We are trying to get him all of these collections. We are getting closer. Great collections for a James Bond lover!
4,Beware those with parts of the first collection,"For those that purchased one of the box sets the first time they were issued, beware: MGM didn't re-release them. They conveniently shuffled the discs around so that if you bought Volume 1 of the old edition, buying volumes 2 and 3 of this edition will leave you missing some movies, and with duplicates of thunderball, live and let die and for your eyes only. Overall, the movies are great and have some good special features which are worth checking out. Just be warned that these new sets don't match up with the previously released ones."
3,MAN IN THE GOLDEN GUN AMD MOONRAKER BURDEN THIS COLLECTION,I love DR. NO and SPY WHO LOVED ME. BUT THE OTHER THREE BOND MOVIES IN THIS COLLECTION ARE JUST NOT VEY GOOD. MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN IS SIMPLY UNWATCHABLE ALONG WITH MOONRAKER. ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE ISN'T THAT BAD BUT ITS NOT GOOD! MY ADVICE IS STICK WITH VOLUME 1 AND 3 OF THE BOND SETS. BUY DR.NO AND SPY WHO LOVED ME SEPERATE TO AVOID TWO MAYBE THREE OF THE WORST BOND MOVIES EVER.
2,not enough quality,"The 2nd collection of James Bond movies was a gift to me. As my title suggests, I do not like movies in mono. They should have re-mastered or done anything they can to not present a movie on DVD in the year 2001 in mono. Rediculuous, IMHO.The movie Dr. No is one of the best Bonds so I have to give the movie pack some positive rating. Plus, DVD is better than VHS so that is a second star.For my money, I would not have spent so much money on 3 of 5 movies in mono. Just not what I'm about.Along the same lines, I bought T2 early on - and it was not remastered at that point for DVD and it sucks as well - even though we all know the content of T2 is among the best. If you can (and if they ever do), I suggest waiting for these to be remastered in 5.1."
2,The collection to miss,"The first James Bond Set include some great Bonds (Goldfinger, Goldeneye, Thunderball, License to Kill), it was a great buy, but this one, its not worth the plastic its wrapped in. I only wish that the two good ones in this set (The Spy Who Loved Me, Dr. No) were replaced with A View to a Kill and Octopussy, so that all of the bad Bond films were together in one set. That way anyone but the most diehard fan who wants all the films could pass on this set. Imagine how nice it would be if there were two sets with great Bonds, and another set with the bad ones. It would be great!"
3,Problems w/ Golden Gun & RCA,"Another great Bond set. But I have an RCA player and went through two different copies of Man with the Golden Gun so far with both not working. Sort of turns into little green boxes about an hour in to the movie. Also same problem with my PC DVD player. Contacted MGM/UA online tech support and they said that Golden Gun ""has problems with RCA players"" and that I need to update my PC DVD drivers. Can someone validate/invalidate this? Has this happened to anyone else at all?"
3,"The James Bond Collection Vol. 2, VHS","Not a bad collection of Bond material, however, this is a mix of various Bond movies with a variety of leading Bond actors. I recommend looking into the 1996 Collections that have the videos in chronological order and primarily by actor. JAMES BOND 007 Collector's Set, Vol. 1 includes all six Broccoli-produced Sean Connery Bond films, to include a 1995 documentary video. JAMES BOND 007 Collector's Set, Vol. 2 includes all seven Roger Moore films and Timothy Dalton's first film. Although these sets are out-of-print, they are still available as used and collector's sets through Amazon.com's Marketplace. If you're like most fans, you'd prefer to have the movies that include your own favorite ""leading-Bond-man""!"
5,Good Bond Set,"This outstanding set includes the films DR. NO, THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN, MOONRAKER, THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, and ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN is on its way to becoming a cult classic while you get George Lazenby's single performance as James Bond in the ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, already a cult classic. THE SPY WHO LOVED ME and MOONRAKER are Roger Moore's two epic Bond productions showing off Ken Adams' production designs for the last time in the series. Ken Adams' production designs were first seen in DR. NO and established the look of the Bond films for rest of the series. Sean Connery's performance in DR. NO remains one of the best to date."
3,Great work by MGM on the first set of DVDs,"Unfortunately, this batch contains the horrible turkey ""Moonraker,"" and the oddly dull ""Man With the Golden Gun."" The others are keepers, including the spectacular ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" which despite a somewhat drab performance by George Lazenby is perhaps the only Bond film with an involving personal story. The real bomb here though again is ""Moonraker."" It as an almost unwatchable piece of junk."
4,"Excellent Set, but the scalpers want your blood for this one","The studio has just re-released this James Bond set three so don't buy it from the scalpers here wanting two to three hundred plus dollars. Amazon will be selling the new re-release Set three as of November 17th. My advice to you is you can buy all three new re-released sets for under three hundred dollars. The set itself is great. Some of the best James Bond movies are in this set. The picture and sound quality are great and they include many extra features. You can get the new sets for under ninety dollars. If you bought the other sets and didn't get this one, do like me and donate the others to charity and buy the new sets. Makes me feel good about cheating the scalpers out of my money instead of them cheating me out it."
3,For collector's eyes only.,"Frankly, I was not that impressed by this box (the first box was top notch, however). In my opinion, MGM rushed this box (and TWINE) out of the door, at the expense of quality. TMWTGG refused to play the 2nd layer, but thank you, Amazon, for replacing it. The picture quality of the other movies is excellent, but none of the movies feature a 2nd audio commentary, as opposed to 6 of the 1st box. On the bright side, the movie that started it all is included, as well as Lazenby's only flic, which compensate for Moonraker. IMHO, you might as well get OHMSS or whichever movie you like best, and forget the rest, unless you're a die-hard JB fan."
1,Holy be-jesus...,"For all the positive reviews, am I the only one who noticed that the cheapest you can get one of this box set for amounts to over $25 a movie? Maybe its just because it the holiday season and due to the amount of shopping impressed upon me at this time of year, but it occurs to me that this is rather outrageous."
2,Nice Try; Don't Buy,"This book makes a valiant attempt to attract Christians by including NT teachings in it's primarily OT discussion about the Biblical Feasts. It's frequent use of scriptures is also commendable. Nevertheless, the author places heavy emphasis on observing the Biblical Feasts utilizing the teachings and traditions of Judaism. Sorry, am not interested."
3,DIY,"Pretty good film of doing it yourself. Worth checking it out for sure. If your looking for step by step instructions then look some place els. This film is about DOING IT, and not wasting time pondering."
4,"Stunning debut, a blend of Devo & something much darker","From the opening, with its samples from the film Zardoz, the enthusiasm & energy of this band are apparent. A unique blend of Devo, Magazine (UK New Wave) with elements of humour spilling through, the album only hints at the full exuberance of the band live. The only thing preventing me giving this five stars is their second album, 'The Great Eye Am', which contains their strongest material"
1,Funtainer leaks,"We bought this stainless steel bottle hoping to avoid plastic. However, we were disappointed because it leaks. When the bottle is turned upside down, the liquid comes out the straw on top. Even when the lid is closed, it evidently doesn't clamp down tightly on the straw so the liquid then spills into the lid -- then it leaks out of the closed lid and into my son's lunchbox."
1,TOMMY BOLINS ENERGY CD,"THIS DISC IS A MUST HAVE FOR THE DEDICATED TOMMY BOLIN FAN, IT IS AN OFFERING OF HIS EARLY WORK WITH HIS ""FAVORITE BAND"" ENERGY."
1,Waste of time,"I just don't understand what people see in Tommy Bolin. Wait! I've got it! Anyone who appreciates cliches, repetition, and unimaginative derivation has got to love Bolin.This album is waste of time, much like the rest of his output."
1,the worst audio u can get,i have to turn my t.v. all the way up to kind of hear anything. its terrible. disc 1 doesnt work in my dvd player but it works in my computer. totally ridiculous. do not buy. i love this show but i dont know what happened with the audio and manufacturing.
2,Light meal,"Guess I'm in the minority on this one. I found these ""dinners"" to be on the dull side. The celebrities, for the most part, seemed uninteresting and hilariously unaware of their egocentricity.The episodes vary considerably in quality, depending on the guests, as you might expect. I'd rent this first before forking over your cash."
3,Something missing,There was just something about this book. Braedan may have been just a little too perfect. I'm not sure. There just didn't seem to be enough conflict between the two. It just seemed too easy. I guess that I've come to expect a bit of a struggle.The villain was well written but I thought the last 1/4 of the book was just too dark. I hate when authors make you feel all sunshiny and bright for most of the book and then you are plunged into dark despair for the remainder. Too jolting.
3,Eh,"I enjoyed a different title by Mary McCall so I figured I'd try this. The book has a interesting enough start but gets pretty boring relatively quickly. I put the book down, remembered I downloaded it, tried to read it again, put it back down only to start and finish a completely different book. I want to say it is a good book but every time I try to read it I get bored and put it down. I think I will be a little more cautious when purchasing anymore titles from this author. I gave it three stars because I'm hoping at some point the book will pick up and I'll end up finishing it. The slow parts are torture."
5,great look at my family history,"this book is part of my family history!! my father's stepfather is the uncle of the author. The pictures allowed my family to see a side of my family right after my mom and dad were married. I very enjoyable tale, that was more fact than fiction. A side of my family I never thought I would ever get to see, let alone read about."
1,VERY UNSAFE LOCK,you remember the lock used on those 1980's Jansports or Lesportsac bags? the one that was the same for all ? was more safe than the one that came with this cash box. even I was able to open it with a clip. the size its ok but the safe is wrong.
4,"Low Price, and Works Well","I went looking for the cheapest cash box I could find, so when I ordered this one, I even anticipated it having a few problems. I've had it for a month now and there hasn't been a single issue, even when I carry it around everywhere. The lock key doesn;t look like it does much to keep it secure, but it actually works very well."
2,pretty cheap,"this cash box is cheaply made, I bought it by it size for my son, personally I wouldn't use it.The lock can be broken off with no tools at all."
3,Not great,"The lock is surprisingly difficult to use and it feels like I could pry it open with 2 fingers if I tried, but for it's price it isn't terrible."
3,You get what you pay for.,"It is just ok. It serves my purpose, but if you are looking for a solid secure box this definitely isn't it. The lock itself is cheap and would be super easy to break. The box is flimsy, and the top was slightly crooked. The price is cheap; the box is cheap. You get what you pay for."
3,Chintzy Keys,"I just received this cash box today. I was a little hesitant to buy because some of the reviews were bad, however this was the only cash box that I could buy with prime membership for two day shipping that fit my budget. The keys I got with the box are very chintzy and they really don't work. They don't fit well in the key hole so I will never be able to lock this box. Thankfully there is a latch that I can use to open and close it. I am not going to return the box it will serve my purpose, I'm using to keep my money that I get selling Avon separate from my personal money and also to look somewhat professional when I host my first avon party in a few weeks. Mostly I will only keep change and not many bills, and if I keep bills in it, it will not be for too long so the box is useful to fit my needs. However if you would like to buy a box that actually locks don't buy this one."
3,"Great, but....","This is a great cashbox, no doubt about it, but it is incredibly flimsy. I just use this to store some papers and business cards, but it feels so flimsy and cheap."
4,Good product for price,"Wasn't too sure how durable this item would be considering the price. After using it, it kept items in compartments neatly organized. The only thing is the latch. I find that if the box is too heavy and it isn't locked, it can have the potential to open up when being carried."
1,Terrible lock,this is the same kind of lock that is on a child's first diary totally unsecure.would not keep any thing in it unattended for to long
2,Poor and Cheap; Quality.,Not Worth the Money; Kids Toy. Would not put the Master name on it. Poor and Cheap; Quality. Would not buy this again. Needs better Description on item.
3,Good while it lasted,"box was used 1-2 mornings a week for 3 months and worked well while it lasted. Unfortunately, the latch simply is built heavy enough for regular use and it broke. Now have to buy a new box. Will find a heavier box to use."
5,It does what it says and quite good too!,"If you need a place to store money, coupons, keys or even important documents, this does the job. There's not much else to say except it's great for storage and the price makes it a better bargain than something else that does the same thing."
1,defective lock,"I purchased two of these. With one of them, the lock never worked. With the other, the lock would not unlock and I had important information that I had to get to. I called the company, Master Lock, and they had no suggestions for getting the items except with the key (duh!) or getting a lock smith (they are about $50/hour for a $12 item). I am returning both items since they are both defective. Not a good average."
1,Non-Functional,"I received the Cash Box in a timely manner. All seemed fine, until today, three days after I received it. The lid will not close on the Cash Box, therefor I can't lock anything. Which defeats the entire purpose of having a LOCKED cash box in the first place. I am extremely dissatisfied considering I help up my end, by paying for the box, and now, 3 days later it doesn't work."
5,It magically fills with money.,"Nope. Its just a metal box. Gave it to my daughter for xmas. She was less than surprised when she opened the gift. However now its one of her most used and useful items. Before, she would put her money anyway, in a drawer or just laying about. Now she has a place to put her cash and we both don't have to worry about her loosing it. Its a good inexpensive and useful stocking stuffer."
2,Its okay,The box is very thin metal and it says its liked by keys but they are very simple keys. someone could open it with a paperclip or screw driver. it also came with the edges of the box rusted. overall it seems like it would work well of small tasks but don't move it around too much.
3,Dissapointing Effort from a Great Singer,"I've been a Joan Osborne fan for years and think she usually brings new life to covers. But this disc falls flat. As soulful as her voice is, she adds nothing new (or that interesting) to most of these Motown (and pseudo-Motown) tunes. I still thnk she's great, but would have expected more from this disc. If you haven't heard much of her, go with ""Pretty Little Strangers."""
5,Her Best,"It is my opinion that this if Joan's best work. It is very soulful, and the sound is great. I would highly recommend this cd to anyone. I have played it over and over again. I wish that I could get it in SACD."
4,You can't go wrong.,"This intriguing mix cover songs and originals make this a very enjoyable collection, although the covers are not as varied as say Annie Lennox's Medusa but still engaging all the same. The tracks seem to pull you in more and more with each listen. ""Baby is a Butterfly"", ""Sarah Smile"" and ""Cream Dream"" were all particularly absorbing the first time through. The production is very good and clean. Her voice is as mesmerizing and sensual as always. You can't go wrong."
4,Fantastic voice and song list,"Most know Joan for her 90's hit ""If God Was One of Us."" She is far from those days. Most would be astounded to hear what Joan;s voice is capable of, as that song only trapped her into a simple octave throughout its verses.Here in ""Breakfast In Bed"", Joan takes the jazz practice of covering American classics and favorites in her dynamic, raspy alto voice. This is a great CD, my favorites include the live performances of ""Heatwave"" and ""What Becomes of a Broken Hearted"" with Motown's Funk Brothers; and classics ""Natural High"" and ""Sara Smile.""Check the song list, if you find any of your old favorites the GET THIS CD, you will definately not be disappointed. However ""What Becomes of a Broken Hearted"" is worth the $13 alone."
3,slightly disappointed,"I love Joan Osborne, but am slightly disappointed in this cd. There are probably 4 REALLY good songs and the remaining ones are so-so to not good. I wouldn't recommend this cd unless you think 4 songs are worth the price."
3,Not her best,"I love Joan Osborne, but was disappointed with this album. It doesn't have the edge that her other music has, and doesn't bring anything new to the songs like she did on How Sweet It Is."
3,Exactly as advertised,"As one reviewer noted, this release is somewhat monotone. Still, it's a relaxing and quality release from Joan that my wife really likes. Getting ""What Becomes of the Broken Hearted"" is a bonus.A couple of the originals are really excellent, stay in your head tunes. I'd say if your having Breakfast in Bed, it works. But it's not an all occasions, ""hey check this out"" kind of release."
3,Love story with complications,"Sophie plays a woman who is very cool emotionally, although smoldering with sensuality. The plot involves her settling for a rather bland husband, then later having an affair with a rugged, dangerous co-worker. Not nearly as unusual as her other Zulawski films, you will still benefit from a healthy appetite for foreign cinema to really enjoy this. I recommend this really if you're a fan of Sophie or Zulawski; if you want to see Sophie's charms in more accessible (though no less french) films, try Fanfan or La Fille de D'Artangan. Or if you don't speak french and sub-titles are not your thing, her one brilliant English-speaking role is in Firelight."
1,Does not fit,This site tells you that this part will fit a base model 1994 chevy s10 pickup 2 wheel drive 2.2L engine size but it does not.
1,Whatever happened to Donald Hinton?,"I am interested in reading this book, but it is out of print now. From the research I have done, this book was written in the late 1990's. It claimed to be co-written by Elvis. He claimed he would be making a comeback in 2002. It is now 2009 and no sign of a resurrection. I have also learned that Donald Hinton lost his medical license shortly after this book was released. He lost the license for over prescribing pain killers and covering up the evidence. I believe he has been granted the license again. It was suspended for 5 years. I would like to know whatever happened to Hinton and is he still claiming that he was contacted by Elvis, or does he admit this is a hoax? I also learned that Hinton was an Elvis fanatic and an Elvis impersonator prior to writing this book.Elvis would be 74 years old by now. Would the world want to see him as an old man, should he choose to reveal that he hoaxed his death?"
1,I called Dr Hintons former Medical Center,"I read the book. I live in Kansas City. I called the regional Medical Center wanting to talk to Dr. hinton. He ""no longer"" worked there. I ask if they had seen his patient ""Elvis"". By their response I could see its not true that Elvis is alive. The Dr. CANNOT offer any proof Elvis is alive. And by the way, was somebody then murdered and buried in Elvis's grave? Who would have comitted the murder? Elvis himself? This is all fiction and opinion. A fantasy book only."
1,Hmmm....,"Well what do you know. It's the year 2003, almost 2004 and no evidence whatsoever to support the idea that Elvis is alive. Elvis is dead, and so is this book."
3,Quick and simple,"I read this book after a friend mentioned it to me. Very interesting and definetely leaves you wondering, but I still have my doubts about Elvis being alive. The evidence is circumstantial and could be from anyone, really. I'm anxiously awaiting August 16, 2002 to roll around to see what happens. I wonder what the reprecussions will be if this Dr. made all this up or if its a hoax?"
1,Awful!,"One of the worst books I've ever read, about Elvis orotherwise! The writing is awful! It proves nothing!If I were stranded on a desert island with just this onebook, I'd throw it in the ocean!!!!The author doesn't explain anything, anyone could havewritten this book, I don't know whether Elvis is aliveor not, but believe me neither does this author!"
1,Associate of Dr Hinton,"It is hard to fathom how any man would stake his reputation and very livelihood on such flimsy evidence. I can share that Dr. Hinton is easily swayed, however, because I happen to know him personally. He is passive and naive. He cannot look others in the eye. He cannot write either. Save your money."
1,let him rest in peace!,Elvis Presley was a great man and the best perfomer i have ever known. I am an Elvis fan and always will be. I think we should keep his legend alive by playing his music and watching his movies.We also need to remember he brought rock 'n' roll into this world. Let us remember him how he was and the good times he brought into peoples lives. We need to let Elvis rest in peace. We could not imagine what this kind of publicity does to his daughter!
5,Kitten antics entice early readers,"Denise Fleming's illustrations make her books but her topics are always enjoyable for young children. I just stumbled across this book and can't believe I have missed it for the past 2 years. It is a precious book and a great gift for beginning readers. I have shared it with children ages 2-6 who enjoy the predictability. This book even stimulated me to write a cat song, to add to my collection of over 200 songs and fingerplays appropriate for young children."
3,Good but many short-comings,"First, the good: This drive has wonderful sound thanks to the dxr3 card. It also has beautiful image quality. The DXR3 card (hardware player) you can view the dvd at any resolution smoothly and flawlessly. Now, the bad...... Some movies lock up the OS entirely. Seems to disable my ability to use tv-out on my video card so i can't watch the movie on a tv. Very annoying thing when you spent extra $ to get tv-out vid card!"
1,Waste of money!!,"I regretfuly have bought three items from Creative Labs-two expensive sound cards and this DVD device, all of which have crashed and burned within three weeks of it being put into my computer.Needless to say, I won't be buying anything from this particular manufacturer again."
5,Page Turner,"Nikki Turner and Chunichi has blew my mind. This book is good from the beginning to the end and will keep your face in the book. I bought this book and was done within two days, and thats only because I had to work, otherwise I would have finished this book in matter of hours. If you dont know, Nikki Turner is the s?*%, I have not read not one bad book from her, she's hot."
2,Not at all what I expected,The book is not what I expected. It was written by 3 different aurthors. The first part could have been good if there was more detail.
2,What is this?,"Before I got my hands on this book I had already heard that it was not on point, so I decided to read the book myself...well try anyway. This book was horrible and not what I expected from such good authors, Vikki and Roy, I don't know the other one. Leave out all the designer clothes and stop with the played out sex-seens. I wish I could return this book and get my money back...I hope 'yalls next book is a %1000 better than this mess...I only gave it a 2 b/c I'm trying to be nice....it really doesn't deserve not one star!"
4,Good Book,"I am new to the Girls From da Hood series but this book kept me reading, i must order the rest of the series soon. The seller is great. I received my book earlier than expected, and I am happy:)"
3,GIRLS FROM THE HOOD,"ALL THE STORYS WE'RE VERY GOOD BUT I DONT REALLY LIKE SHORT STORY BOOKS.THEY ALL GOT GOOD THEN LEFT YOU AT THE END OF YOU'RE SEAT WONDERING WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!BUT I GUESS ITS KIND OF GOOD NOW I WANNA GO BUY ALL 3 BOOKS!(FIRST STORY WAS BEST I THINK):)THANKS, I LOVE READING THESE BOOK!!!!!"
4,Very Good,"Here are three very good short stories about bad girls from da hood and the men who love them. Unique, Nina and Anyeh are the three scandalous broads who rule each of these stories.All three stores were written well and each commanded my attention. If I had to pick one to become a full length novel it would be Roy Glen's Story. I felt his story could have gone on for at least another hundred and fifty pages.There is an erotic treat at the end of the book from author Carl Weber."
3,Not as bad as some of the reviews claimed to be!,I really could not put this book down. The first story by Nikki Turner was the best. The other two was good also. Then the little short story at the end was something that made you wanting more. Great job you guys!
3,You May Want To Borrow This One,"This book as not as good as I thought it would be. I think Nikki Turner's story, which was the first, was also the best. The editors must have known that also considering the book went downhill from her story. The stories were just a little far fetched even for ""hood stories"". If you just like the short story format I recommend ""A Dollar And A Dream"" and ""Around The Way Girls"" instead of this."
4,a girl from da hood,THIS BOOK WAS PRETTY GOOD ALTHOUG I WOULD HAVE TO REALY RATE EACH STORY SEPERATLY BUT I DONT HAVE MUCH TIME TO GO BACK. THIS BOOK IS ABOUT THREE WOMEN WHO ARE TRYING TO JUST SURVIVE SOME GET GREETY AND ANOTHER JUST WANTS TO GET OUT. NIKI KEEP IT GANGSTA AS USUAL AND IAM AWAITING THE NEXT BOOK THE GLAMROUS LIFE I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE WORTH WAITING FOR. ROYGLEEN/CHUNICHI YALL DID YOUR TANG TOO ON THIS BOOK CONGRATS TO ALL THREE OF YOU. NIKI WHEN WE GONNA GET THAT BOOK WITH YOU AND WHAIDA GIRL?
1,Button doesn't work..,"The doorbell I received would not work unless I twisted and pushed it several times. Since it is not lit, their is no indication that the doorbell has rang."
5,"Loved it! A ""Must Read!""","I started the book and finished it over the weekend. I wasn't expecting to want to read the book cover to cover, but I couldn't help it! I am buying this book for all my girlfriends for Christmas."
3,Orange Sol loosened caulk,Product was slower to work than I thought it would be. Probably no different than other citrus solvents.Biggest disappointment was the loss of about $10.00 worth of solvent which leaked from the defective bottle.
1,No better than goo be gone,"I had great hopes for this solution when I read the glowing reviews and the title ""Contract"" on the label. However, I was trying to get off paint (been on for years) from the hinges of an old Army trunk, valuable to me for sentimental purposes.This solution was my last resort, and it did not work as well as the five others I had tried. I finally ditched the trunk as I had spent too many hours trying to restore it and NOTHING worked, including this solvent."
1,Scary,This is sooo scary!! I guess this music is good if you happen to be under 10. Any older and there are some serious problems.
3,ds...eh...,Dream Street Live was probably my favourite movie back when i was obsessed but if ur a ds fan i really recommend it to u
1,holy mother of god!,"my lord people, can you really be serious? This is one of the worst dvd's by one of the worst bands of all time. Pretentious pop music is ruining our society's ability to develop a sense of individuality. These pre-pubescent kids don't even play instruments, and the lip-syncing is more than obvious. Everything about this is tacky and awful"
5,-------,The DVD is awesome. I looked all over for it at the mall and found it in the last row of DVD's and it was the last one!!!! I love D.S. and anybody else who does.. should get this!!!!P.S. I Love Jesse and Matt!!!
5,The best video ever!!!,"for all you dream street fans out there, this is a must have video! Their performance is awesome and they sing great.This a video that everyone should buy!!"
5,I'm a big fan!,"I've known Dream Stree ever since they were ""born."" They are my best friends, and when I saw this video with them I think I got closer and got to know them better than I already did. I watch this everyday with my baby brother, Jesse (my mom named him after Jesse!). He just started talking and can sing the song Sugar Rush. It's great to sit down and watch the video and sing along. I know all the dance moves from the video also. I think Claudia should come out with a video like Darens Dance Grooves!"
5,DREAM STREET RULES!!!!,"This is possibly one of the greatest DVD's in my entire DVD collection. All the dance moves are hot as well as the singers. It's so much fun to watch and Chris, Jesse, Greg, Frankie, and Matt are so talented. This DVD is a must for all Dream Street fans and even for non-Dream Street fans because once they see how hot and how talented the five guys of Dream Street are they will become fans. Once I got this DVD I grew to love the five boys from New York! It has fun behind-the-scene footage,so you kind of get to know the guys a little bit more.Dream Street rules and this DVD proves in all! I LOVE CHRIS AND JESSE!!!!!"
5,Jesse McCartney is my life<3 i'm in love.,"I'm a huge huge huge huge huge dream street fan. And i'm an even bigger JMac fan. I have his cd and everything and i own the dvd. i'm very pleased. It's great because jesse sings so great live and his voice just makes me melt. I also like greg alot but i like jesse more. The before the show is my favorite when they're getting ready and stuff. They sing a-ca-pella and it's so great. Claudia tells jesse to get back in line but he's so into it! if you haven't seen it you really should. and i also like after the show when jesse talks about someone trying to peg them during the show. and when they talk about jesse's love for peanut butter. oh jess, i would swim in a pool of peanut butter with you anyyy dayyy!! and when greg makes fun of the girl in the audience haha. Anyways you should really really really see it if you're a fan<3***Jesse's biggest fan=D!!=-*"
4,Less performance less mess,Got these pads for a 2004 xc90 T6. The pads installed just fine with no problems and they don't squeal. Used these with brand new Zimmerman rotors. The pads do produce less dust than non ceramic pads but compared to the OEM pads that were on there I don't think they have the same stopping power. They just feel a touch softer. There isn't enough difference to junk these and spend $150 on something ele but next time I do a brake job I'll probably go a different route. However I think most people get these pads due to their low dust. I rated them 4 stars because they are low dust but I think for me I'd rather wash the wheels more often in exchange for some more stopping power.
5,Moves that Break Ainkles,these Moves on this Dvd are truly wicked&Break your Ainkles just sight on seen.this One truly Captures Some of the baddest handlers around the Country the Ball-Handling Skills&Hops here are truly Wicked.
4,Barnyard of Fun,"My 3 y/o grandson has fun with this game (will be 4 in Oct. '08). His parents wanted him to have more games that would give him a chance to think and strategize. It's a little advanced right now, but he has fun learning. It's bright and colorful. The game combines his knowledge of colors and numbers/counting to advance all 4 of his characters across the barnyard before his opponent can. He's delighted if Grandma's cow, pig, turkey or duck has to start over. The only negative in the games durability is the playing pieces. They are cardboard animals that slide into plastic stands. Little hands can ruin these in a short time. I think that one piece colored, plastic animals would work better."
2,Confusing,I purchased this game to work with preschoolers. The pieces are not durable and the playing board is very confusing- too many colors and it's difficult to visualize how to get from one side of the board to the other so the kids can't understand the object of the game. They did enjoy using the animal pieces. That's why I gave the game 2 stars; otherwise I would have rated it lower. Save your money and buy Trouble with the pop up dice instead.
1,Hummingbird Feeder,"I recieved the product with a missing bead (decoration), I did not mind that as much as the fact every time I try to fill it, no matter how secure the fit is, it leaks all of the solution out. Although pretty, I would think twice before purchasing again."
1,Received Clear Feeder with missing parts,"Well I bought this hummingbird feeder for my Mom for Christmas. Even though the sticker on the box says alto blue feeder, I received a CLEAR square shaped feeder with missing pieces. The feeder came in a highly damaged box. Needless to say this feeder is being RETURNED."
5,Highly rated,"After doing lots of research, I decided to purchase this set of Wüsthof knives and am glad I did. I was concerned that the slicer and chef's knives might be short, but they are perfect! I actually like them better than my older longer knives because they are easier to control. I hadn't realized that my old knives were just a little too long for me all these years.I like the balance on the knives and the handles feel good in my hand. The way the blade and handle come together on the knives is nice and smooth and much easier to clean than my old knives. My fingers feel protected. The blades are nice and sharp.I am happy with my purchase!"
5,True Entertainment,"This FF game is the first ive played but after i played it for a long time, i tried the 2nd and 3rd on SNES and 7 on ps2 they were nothing compared to this one and here's why(In my opinion) this game is a very simple,complex,epic,adventure and hard all in one, the constant encounter's with enemy's like in the previous game's was addictive for me as well as the various monster's you encounter from common to rare is a blast, the effects the graphics are still eye popping even today the voice's and sound effect's were great, now onto grinding which is 90% of the time, is taken to another level with chain killing the same type of monster for some unique item's or just for fun and of course EXP, easy to handle in combat easy to play when you got the right flow, buy it and expect True Entertainment and the best RPG on the ps2."
4,For the Final Fantasy Fanatics...,"Over all, I am just not fond of this game. I couldn't get into the storyline and I HATE the new battle system. (What were they thinking?! It's insanely easy for the most part until you get to a boss. Then it becomes almost impossible to work with.)It does have one great thing going for it and that's the graphics. They are jaw-droppingly beautiful. Most of the cinematics look real (including faces and hair). The story is not all bad, but it is a bit generic. I just wasn't captivated by it. Not like some of the older games. (VI & VII to name two) It just didn't feel right.The special bonus DVD that comes with the Collector's Edition made up for my disappointment with the game. It's somewhat awkwardly put together, but I enjoyed hearing the history behind each game as well as seeing the concept art for each. :)It's definitely worth the purchase if you are a Final Fantasy Fanatic."
3,I thought the story could of been better. : ),"I thought the new combat system rocked and the graphics were stunning.I played this game till the end.Don't Hate, I thought story wise it could of been better.I loved 6,7,8,9,10, and x2. For there character development, graphics, plot,, music, and different settings.Overall it was not a Horrible game to play, but I tend to go back to the other ff games.Rent it or borrow it and see what ya think : )"
5,A Must Own,"My original copy of the Final Fantasy 12 i originally owned was leftat a friends house and never seen again. I pre-ordered it at game stopand I still remember picking it up. It came in a great steel book case which protected the gameand the extras disc. The extras discs had an awesome Final Fantasy retrospective. Thisis a game that shouldn't be passed up on by any true Final Fantasy fan, if you are a new fanor a seasoned veteran then definitely pick this game up. It is worth your time, and the graphics are amazing!"
4,Final Fantasy XII,"No doubt a great game for Square Enix once again. Although it strays from the usual path of Final Fantasy games, the changes make it a new experience that veteran Final Fantasy gamers must adapt to. Great story and plot. I was borrowing a friends and didn't want to give it back just yet, so i recently bought my own copy. This game is a great addition to the series, and pulls you in from the very beginning."
4,It's Final Fantasy without my favorite part...,"The great battle system. Final Fantasy games have always had intuitive, fun, battle systems (I know, I know, FF8 wasn't the best...) except this game. I guess you could say this game's battle system is intuitive, but it lacks greatly, in my opinion, when it comes to fun or engaging.Overall, the game is a good game. Story is good, characters are good, and of course, the graphics and movies are good. Check this installment out if you're a Final Fantasy fan or not, but don't be expecting the best of the series.The bonus features that come with this collector's edition are very nice. The featurettes of the past FF games are really cool, along with the rest of the features on the bonus disk."
5,Corso:simply brilliant,"Gregory Corso must have been sitting in an empty room, with nothing more to think of than the emotions controlling his mind. In this book of poetry, the reader will gain a new appreciation for his work. The Happy Birthday of Death is one of the most powerful, and intense collections of writing available."
2,just OK,"it's not bad, but nothing special. Looks very plain, the craftsmanship is just ok. Definitely not warm. Worth $12 i paid for it, but not much more.I'm keeping mine only because i always need extra throws to protect furniture from cat claws."
2,Still waiting to receive it/no word yet,I originally got the shoe ...WAY too big. Couldn't be returned to Amazon. So sent back to brick & mortor store. After one phone call and one email ... still haven't received the exchanged smaller size. Sure hope I'm just NOT OUT $50 bucks. I'll be very unhappy.
3,Good casual look,This shoe is nice looking but it is not as comfortable as some of the other Easy Spirit shoes I have.
4,Comfy,These are very comfortable shoes. Very lightweight. My only problem is that the top part that comes up toward the ankle is a little binding.
3,Nice Shoes But...,I had to return them because they made my hip hurt when I wore them around the house for a few minutes. Probably just my quirky hip. The shoes looked and felt good on my feet.
5,Comfy,"These shos go anywhere you do. Shoppng, the movies, yard work, they go with you. And they clean up with water, no scrubbing."
1,Not reliable,"Greetings. I bought this system and three additional phones to go with it. I think the design is outstanding, and it's a great set of features (being able to have only one base unit and simply add phones in other rooms) but unfortunately, the reliability isn't there. The LCD displays on two of the phones have crapped out, and now the phone that sits on the base unit keeps losing contact with the base during phones calls, despite the fact that I am only two feet away at my desk when using it. If everything worked as designed and the reliability was good, I'd be praising this phone to the sky, but as it stands now, I'd have to say, look for something else."
3,Wireless 802.11b/g interfere with 2.4 Cardless phones frequency,"My computer wireless network was dropping intermittantly after I bought this phone. 2.4 GHz cordless telephones operate at the same frequencies as 2.4 GHz 802.11b and 802.11g wireless LAN access points, network adapters, and other devices. First I didn't know this and I changed my router from 802.11b to 802.11g. Then changed my wireless cards to comply with it. Still having problem. Now it is time to go back to same old 900 Mhz phones."
5,love this phone!,"There is nothing like a great phone & this one is it! Because it 'speaks' the Caller ID info, this phone is helpful for people who need reading glasses. Granted, it doesn't always pronounce things correctly, but it is still very useful. I find myself not even getting up until I hear who it is -- this phone has saved me from rushing across the room on so many occassions. The second unit is a fantastic plus, which works at over 75 feet from the base. The base unit's speakerphone also works well. I'm yet to test the answering machine."
4,Panasonic KX-TG2357B 2.4 GHz,Awesome phone. My wife loves it. Very sleek. Speakerphone is extremely clear as well.
5,Great Phone,Its a great product. I have been using this phone for more than 2 years now and never faced any problem.Panasonic is the BEST in the wireless phone technology.
4,"Very Good, But Not Great","I've had this phone for one year now. The talking caller ID is awesome. I will never own another phone that doesn't have that feature. Everything works as it should, and it's a comfortable phone.The negatives are few, but noteworthy. In the last 2 months or so, the base unit has developed a situation where the charge cycles on and off. It's annoying because the phone beeps every time the charging begins, and it does this with no specific rhythm or pattern. Also, I recently installed a wireless video monitor system in my residence, with one camera in the basement, and another on the front porch. Since installing it, the phone reception has become poor at best."
1,keys failed,"ght this phone about a year ago & the keys stopped functioning after 8 months of use,- would not recommend this phone to anyone.."
2,Talking Caller ID did not work for me,I was excited on purchasing this phone with the Talking Caller ID feature. I programmed my phone numbers and it does not work! I called Panasonic customer service and the phone company and it still doesn't work - such a disappointment. The caller ID works just fine except the talking caller ID :(
2,NOT the best option.,"The phone has great features, and we use it in our office... but never before have so many clients ask us to repeat ourselves or annunciate our words because ""we sound far away"". Apparently these Panasonic phones last a good three months before people start having difficulty hearing you. Everyone in the office has to yell, and frankly it is getting annoying. We are getting rid of them and buying another brand.I don't know whether the other earlier posts are by actual customers or sales reps, but you will know what I mean in a few months."
2,ABOUT AS RELIABLE AS A BLIND SURGEON!,"OK, I'll admit it I've owned Panasonic 5.8 GHz phones for years so this is not my first one. They work great for about 12-18 mos and then the ""planned obsolescent"" time bomb goes off. The phone VERY often loses connectivity to the base which is 8 feet from the hand set. This means that I'll pick it up and the phone is dead. By now I've learned how to fix that which requires doing one OR more of the following: unplug the phone line, power it down for 10 seconds, remove the battery for ten seconds and with the application of each remedy, re-insert the phone into its cradle. It ain't the phone gang, it is the way they are made!! Not the worst product in the world but I hope I don't ever need to dial 911 on a day the phone loses connectivity with its base cause I'll be dead by them I get it to work again!"
3,"2 years after purchase, it's ok...","Reception is an issue - it has an all day every day added ""bonus"" of picking up a local AM radio station which is always playing behind every call. There is no option to change to a different signal so it's quite annoying. Also picks up static from my little space heater. Otherwise it's been a typical Panasonic phone (had 3 previous to this one). Main complaint is the difficulty in turning off the talking caller ID - have to know the secret procedure once you turn it on. Speaker phone feature on the handset is quite nice and it's survived being dropped several times."
2,Waste of time,"I bought this phone to replace an old sony 900 mhz and separate answering machine set up. I thought it would be nice to replace the two units with one.Bad move. Everything seemed fine with the panasonic unit at first-- i was impressed with all the nifty features-- but when I called myself (using my cell phone) the answering machine cut off after about 10 seconds and didn't register that a message had been left. I went online to the panasonic site and tried all the ""tips"" including setting the date/ time, setting the record time, using the default greeting, ""rebooting"" the machine several times, all to no avail. I even tried replacing the unit with a new one. Again, no luck.I'm back to my old Sony set up. It's old and ugly, but at least it works..."
1,Alert! - EXTREMELY POOR QUALITY KEYPAD - Steer clear,"This phone system would be pretty nice except for the EXTREMELY POOR QUALITY KEYPAD. Ours worked okay for about a year, then the keypad became unreliable and very difficult to use. Numbers have to be depressed several times (with a lot of pressure) to get them to enter (particularly 1, 2, and 3), then will frequently enter 2X when they finally take. I've sometimes found it impossible to dial a number because of the errors it introduces, particularly when trying to enter account numbers, etc. for automated services. If Panasonic were a decent company, they would have never allowed such garbage to be made and sold. Given our experience, I will never trust another Panasonic product and strongly suggest you buy from a different (quality) manufacturer."
5,Camo Watch Review,"Very ""trendy"" watch with leather wristband. Large easy to ready face + indiglo feature for night viewing. Reasonably priced. Slightly large for a ladie's wrist, but this lady still likes it."
5,Great buy,"Good quality comfortable shoe.I work 12hr shifts as a nurse and before getting these my feet and legs would ache after work.these shoes made a huge difference.I've gotten so many compliments from coworkers and patients families.Great buy, I used $20 off 2 pr shoes."
4,Cheap sneakers that don't look cheap,"I bought these for my girlfriend for $21 in November because she needed a new pair of athletic shoes. I wasn't expecting much for the money, so I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived and looked like they could have cost 3-4 times as much. It's a very simple shoes that nixes the frills of the flashier Megaride/Gigaride models of Adidas that use the A3 outsoles. Instead, this model has a lightweight Adiprene foam outsole that makes the shoe light overall. You could seriously balance the shoe on the tip of your index finger. My girlfriend says they're very comfortable as well, and I guess that's what really matters."
3,"Good protection, wont stay on the car","I never had a problem with the fabric. It did a nice job over the winter, even with heavy snow.But it high winds it will blow off. I added grommets and bungie cords to help hold it on. this works except under high winds."
3,Limited Outdoor Protection,"Fits great. Nice security availability. Good for bird droppings but other than that, not good for outdoor use. Allows rain to get to car and doesn't do much for dust either. Probably would work better indoors."
3,"Informative book, but check the accuracy before leaving home","This book appeared to answer all possible questions we had about a golfing pilgrimage to Ireland and Northern Ireland. The star ratings clearly demonstrate the quality of the courses and appear to be accurate, and it is set out in a format that makes organising a trip a simple task.The only pitfalls are the prices that appear in the book....Wait for the next edition to come out before purchasing this book...."
2,Look before you buy!,"My opinion of this tool started dropping when I saw the gold lettering on the spine was shoddily applied. Also, the conversion to ""large print"" was badly done(even though the book is physically huge). Study Bibles are a tough problem for layout because of the large amount of information which needs to be accomodated. The layout here was poorly chosen and produced very cramped and unattractive pages. I frankly found the ""chain references"" to be little more than what most reference Bibles contain in their center column references. If you're looking for a study Bible, look elsewhere than here!"
3,Eh.,"First i want to say, the gun they give you for this game when you buy it is a piece of junk. I don't want to be too harsh, but honestly, the thing blows. I bought another ' controller ' for this game to play 2 player. ( I got a laser gun.. it kinda hurts when it shines in your eyes.. ) This game is worth a buy for someone a fan of shooting, obviously. I enjoy the shooting mini-games they threw in this game.. even though there were only 2 or 3 of them. There is one that is a retro kinda game where you shoot little plates. That game can then be upgraded though to a newer 3D game where you shoot plates. Another one is just shooting a target. I am really good at it, if i do say so myself. But the thing about this game though, it's like playing an arcade game at home. And it really is some good fun. ( with two people. )"
1,It doesn't work.,"I tried Mavala Stop before this. Should have just stuck with Mavala Stop.Here's why it's no good:* There's no way to apply the cream. You have to just smear it on your nails, I guess with your fingers. Now you've got it all over your fingers. What if you want to eat finger food later? Not a problem, because...* It doesn't actually taste like anything. You're probably better off with ordinary hand lotion, which tastes about as mild. Basically, this stuff is ordinary hand lotion, but amazingly expensive.* Even if the above weren't true, it doesn't last. Every time you wash your hands, it's gone, much like, you know...hand lotion. Because...it IS hand lotion.This product is just 1.5 oz of hand lotion in 6 jars for $50. You can get 18 oz of hand lotion for like 3 bucks at your local store.Perhaps my shipment was bad, somehow, but...they gave me 6 jars, not 1, and all 6 are no good.Don't buy it! Check out Mavala Stop. It's on Amazon somewhere."
5,Very good,"I am a very sever nail biter, and I have tried MANY products to help me stop. But Control IT has helped be kick this habit! I never thought it would happen. The taste is so gross it is awesome! Thank you Control IT I would recommend it to ANYONE!"
3,Pleasant musical comedy,"This film takes the familiar Three Musketeers story and adds musical numbers and slapstick routines from the Ritz Brothers. It has a good cast both in the lead and minor roles, but it never reaches the heights in terms of entertainment. The songs are pleasant but undistinguished and this includes the opening song sung by Don Ameche and then reprised throughout the film at various times. The comedy routines from the Ritz Brothers are fairly amusing.The film looks quite handsome with its appealing lead players,costumes and sets. The film is not long at 72 minutes and it is a pleasant way to pass that time if you enjoy this genre, which I do."
3,not what I expected,I really did not care for the movie as I was not expecting a 3 stooges type of movie. But my hsuband enjoyed. it arrived in good shape and played well.
1,Carbon Fiber Razr Cover,I did not like the way it fit my phone. I have bought another cover since which fits much better. The cut outs for the viewing window and camera lenz do not match very well even thought the cover is snapped in place and can not be adjusted. The buttons on the side of the phone are difficult the actuate with the cover in place. Not a good buy at all.
1,UFC needs Vince McMahon to overseer their DVD releases,"I've been waiting for the release of 57 for over two years. Finally it's out, and whoopteedoo, I need to purchase 43 and 52 - which I already own - as well? Why would they do this?First, they make it exclusive to credit card orders through underpaid operators.Then, they advertise the Ultimate Iceman DVD, as containing Randy/Chuck 3. Well, that was false advertising taken to the nth degree. They just show you the last 5 seconds. Otherwise, they're just freeze frames.Now, they're forcing me to buy two DVD I already own... I wish the UFC would take a page out of the WWE's DVD department. They not only release their DVDs a few weeks after their PPVs, but they also don't edit/cut all the entrances, prefight/postfight interviews."
2,C'mon!! I already had'em!,"Why Dana White is feeling the need to beat up my wallet like it's in an MMA match is beyond me. I suppose if I didn't own every UFC I would be glad and this would be a deal but, since I do already have two copies of UFC 43 both in boxset and on its own, I really don't need another. They should have packaged this fight as a standalone as well. Besides, from a moronic standpoint I enjoy looking with pride down my dvd rack at all of my UFC's yellow/ bold print and numbers in sequential order! Yeah, I have issues but alas, you know I had to bend on buying this! The bonus material is kinda lame as is the packaging hence my 2 star rating but as far as the fight goes...great 5 stars to the class of Randy! Glad he's back after the loss and champion again! If you're new to MMA, buy it...buy everything!!! Check out Pride and WEC as well."
1,Horrible Treatment of Dedicated Fans,"Why on Earth would the UFC treat their dedicated fans like this? I too have collected all the Pride events and UFC events via DVD over the last few years. I want 57 only as I already spent good money on the other two UFC DVDs. Even on their website they don't offer 57 separately. It makes no sense. It's like saying, hey all you guys that love us and pay for our DVD events, if you want 57, you have to buy two duplicates you already own and waste your money. It really bugs me. If anyone knows where to get a UFC57 DVD. Please let me know. I'm not even going to buy from the UFC website anymore after this."
1,Cheezy marketing trick,Packaging this with two other UFCs is a cheap marketing trick :(Not happy with the UFC marketing department.
5,encyclopedia of creative cooking,"This is one of the best cookbooks I own. Easy to follow instructions, great ideas and a good read. If I need something special or just want to try something different, this is the cookbook I grab and go through until something hits my fancy and it has never let me down. I have owned my book since 1985 and still find something new each time I am on the search for something different."
4,Alot of Big Men can do weights but they cant do the BAR!,I liked this DVD. The guy who reviewed this before that seen Superman Pullups in gym class is on [drugs]. ... No one does this stuff in Gym class! Way beyond normal pullups. He either didnt do the workout just watched it. Or he's hating. No other options. This is a very good DVD. My only complaint and why it didnt get Five stars is they need to give more of a unified program that a beginner could do. Instead of flipping from playground to playground with a bunch of different people. Im looking forward to volume 2. Keep the first guy that demonstrated the pullups througout the video in the next one and you have a winner. He seemed to explain things the best.
3,Rap Lalaine,"This video basically covers all the calisthenics that you can do in an inner city playground. That, and the yo,yo,yo type ""flava"" of the commentators is what make this vido entertaining. I especially enjoyed the ""Hood Aerobics"" chapter. Seriously, there is one! In all seriousness, the video does show some very good bodyweight exercises. I don't personally care for all the stupidity, but there are some ideas in there. If you are serious about bodyweight exercises, I suggest that you look for a copy of the old Karl Gotch video that Matt Furey used to sell. As much as I dislike his current stuff, that video was remarkable and showed everything that could be done without weights. Buy this video for entertainment value or if the gangsta fantasy pushes you to workout."
4,Thugs Do Fitness!,"Thug Workout: Fitness from the Streets is not your customary workout video, in fact, at first glance, the brash language and in your face style would seem more ""Thug"" than actual ""Fitness"".But the operative word here is fitness, and these guys have developed some wickedly good routines that consist of various pull-ups, push-ups and dips. But what makes these common exercises different, is ""how"" they're executed ... some of which, most people won't be able to immediately perform. For those that can, you'll get a very challenging workout.The only draw backs are that the video tends to repeat certain exercises throughout and there is no lower body routine.But if you're looking for a new way to shake-up your workout or add something to an existing one, this will certainly supply you with some new and interesting material."
5,Work out like a man,"Thug work out is an awsome dvd, ive been workin out in school yards for bout a year now, this stuff works. Sick exercises, for the novice or the expert, this dvd will make u tougher"
4,For those fed up with the conventional Church's explainations,"Many years ago, my brother handed me this book. I looked at the title and then at the apple on the cover and immediately said, ""Of course!"" He simply said ""read it ..."". I did and my entire outlook on theology was changed forever. Don't be dissuaded by the Pharasees from our ""highly regarded"" seminaries - this is a book worth reading - if only to understand that there are plenty of alternative views on the scriptures - and that the conservative fundamentalists may not always have all the answers - or questions. I didn't agree with all that Elseth wrote - but I certainly was able to make up my own mind ..."
4,later gator yep,This was a ok story because bobby was suppose to buy teddy a turtle.But he got him an alligator his mom was mad so was he dad but teddy was really happy.The alligator made thare house smell realy bad.
4,Handy,This is a cheap and easy way to solve the where do I put the portable dvd player at for both the kids to watch. I am very pleased with how easy it is to install and take out. It's very sturdy.I Would recommend this item.
4,dvd player car holder,the product works for the dvd player I brought. It saves a lot of fuss. thanks
5,Love it!,"We bought this for our car trip to CA, from WA. We have two kids, ages 7 and 2. It worked great. We were able to set up the dvd player in no time and the kids were quiet!! Easy to install and take down. Great product."
4,DvdDr 70200 00 Portable DVD Player Car Mount,"Overall a good buy. A little wobbly but does the job. Durabilty is ok. the hook part already came off but can be gorilla glued, not a biggie."
3,Nice Alternative,This is a great item if it can be placed some where that the kids wont bump into it. It is not as durable as I thought it should be. Over all it is a great alternative to the bag that most portable systems come with. I love this idea just wish it was a little stronger. Oh and assembly was fairly easy.
1,Not very practical,"I bought this item hoping to use it on a long trip. The problem was that it couldn't hold the player level and steady between the two fron seats, especially if the front seats were adjusted and were different heights. It just didn't function well enough to watch movies."
5,Excellent product,"For the price, this product works perfectly! I highly recommend it and it works with every type of car. Not only are the arms expandable but it will swivel too."
2,Did it's job... but it's flimsy!,"I think that the idea was great. It has it's function... but it's really flimsy. The plastic connections are hollow, so it feels like it's going to snap easily! I think that they should go back to the drawing board and make it better. It's a buy because you have to, more than anything. For the price, it's okay. Overall, if there is something, anything in the market that may be an option - get that one instead!"
3,Works but not very stable.,"I bought this for our small SUV and I am using it with a netbook computer and not a DVD player, it is below the weight limit and at the screen size limit. It works but is not as stable as I would like, as long as you don't hit big bumps it should be OK."
1,Junk,"I bought this because it had relatively good reviews. I'm not sure if I got the only one that was junk, but this thing did not work for me. The hooks that attach to the headrest pulled out of the support bar causing the entire mount (along with a $250 dvd player) to crash to the ground. So everytime I've used the thing it has crashed to the ground after a several minutes of driving. I think we made it 15 minutes once. On top of that, when it does manage to work as intended without falling, the motion of the car causes the dvd play to rotate forward and backwards getting stuck at odd viewing angles. Might work okay on long flat stretch of highway like in Kansas or somewhere, but not ideal hills or turns. The idea is great but the flimsiness of the unit made in unusable for us. Very disappointed."
2,Grammy,"This was a neat idea, but it didn't work for my 2005 Honda Pilot! The headrests on my pilot do not move, so I was not able to hook the mount to my headrests. Another review said that he used bungee cords which I also implemented. It works fine with them, although it does wobble a little. It would have been nice to have know beforehand that the mount does not work for all vehicles."
3,It's not bad,But not great. It installs through the headrests so you have to keep both the driver and passenger seats at the same height while in use. We used it a few times but it got to where it just wasn't worth the trouble to install so the girls will generally prop the player on their legs.
2,I had to return this.,"I really wanted to love this. But when I installed it as the instructions said, it totally blocked the view in my rear view mirror. I could not see a thing. Maybe it's my car -Mazda5, but I think it's a hazard."
4,Simple and Easy,"This is a quick, easy solution to mounting a portable DVD player in your car. All 3 of my boys can watch a movie and there has been no fighting over who sits in the middle so I think the overall view is good for all seats. My only complaint would be the elastic strap in the back, I was unclear on where exactly it should go so I use it to secure the DVD player but then I can't close the player all the way while the strap is on. The other strap is velcro but it goes over the player so you would have to remove it to change DVDs so I don't use it. We have had zero problems and even drove it through the pot-holy streets of New Orleans (where we live) and it did great. Over all a great product."
3,Gets the job done,"Its a bit flimsy, but usable. Easy to install. It blocks view into the backseat when in use. I returned this item for one that mounts to the back of the headrest. Amazon.com made it VERY easy to return the item."
1,terrible product,"This was pretty much worthless, in my opinion. We have a 4 car sedan (Acura). When you place the DVD mount between the two front seats, the DVD screen basically blocks the entire rear view mirror, so you can't see a thing behind you when driving (except for the back of the DVD screen).Strangely, in all of the pictures, the two arms that extend (to latch onto the headrests of the front seats) look like they are in a stright line. This is also what the picture looks like on the box as well. However, these arms are really at about a 30 degree angle from the base. So, unless the front passenger seat is pushed way back (futher back than the driver seat), the DVD player screen is rotated so far that only the person in the back passenger seat has a direct view of the screen.Tried this in my car for about 60 seconds...and then returned it."
2,complitely blocking blind spot on your right,bought this one for a trip to NY. I was very disappointed because it blocked a blind spot on my right. Returning the item to Best Buy and looking for a better one.
4,Good Product,The mount works well. If I had any negative comments about this product it would be that it does shake a bit during driving. Worth the money though. Both kids could view and hear the dvd player great.
3,I Love you Deborah Iyall !,"Having been a huge fan of Romeo Void, when I heard about this cd, I smiled for weeks. I had the chance to see her at a local record store and then again at a club in San Francisco. Not only did she sound as good as ever, I got to meet her. She gave me a big hug. She is AWESOME! The music is a bit thin in spots but then again it's about the voice and the way she can make you feel the same emotions as she does.Welcome back to my playlist Deborah and please keep on singing and making music,it can only get better."
5,"Agent Emes, my kids' hero","Hi! We own the whole set, and let me tell you, the entire family can repeat, word for word, the scripts of the movies.And by 'my entire family' I mean myself, my husband, and all the kids, all the way down to my two year old.In fact, just the other day he quoted, to my utter delight, a full dialogue from ""The Fish Head."" He also knows, and can act out 'what Shimmy does in an earfquake.'Thank you for putting out such wholesome, enriching, entertaining, ect. entertainment.Only one problem - my husband's hat collection is now in a very sorry state.My message to you - buy these videos. You will not regret it.-A satisfied parent"
5,Value for money !,"I saw the speakers and thought, it'll be great for my home pc. When I got the package, my pc was with my sister so I thought, I'll connect it to my TV to see the quality of sound it can produce. I hook it up and disconnect the mini-hifi system that I had connected to the TV.My wife insist that we tried the speakers with the Jurassic Park movie, just to compare it's bass reproduction capabilities. Boy, It sounded much better than the mini-hifi system that was originally in it's place.After a few more movies and live concerts, I decided that the speakers should stay connected to the TV. The very same day, I went out to get another one, for my PC."
5,Awesome Sound System for your computer....,"This sound system is very capable of producing excellent quality sound on your computer. I have had no complaints with this system. It was easy to install, easy to hook up, and ready to go in around 10 minutes. Works great in unison with your current computer speakers if you would like. The wired remote control is great as I mounted it to my computer desk for easy control of the powerful subwoofer and satellites. It's a excellent system for a excellent price!..."
5,God for Us,"Excellent, theologically sound. Takes the Trinity from an Incarnational point of view. Stiff sledding in parts but stick with it."
4,A discussion of Trinitarian Beliefs and their conflicts through time.,"In a time when we do not hear much about The Trinity, this book opens up the complex arguments which have historically occurred on this subject. Her background is obviously Roman Catholic, but her viewpoint is convincingly objective. If you do not have a theological background in this subject matter, you will receive one reading this book."
4,mi amado mr. B,"Fun to read, you would have liked it had more pages. It definitively reminds me of the technique and 'desenfadado' way of writing of Bayly's."

4,"Simple return, fast refund!","This was my second time using TurboTax. This year I bought the Premier edition, and it was nice to have the Its Deductible software included. The return process is very user-friendly and I like being able to go back and review/edit previous sections. Also having my 2004 information already saved in last year's TurboTax made this year go much quicker because I didn't have to re-enter employer info, etc. I completed my return on a Sunday, e-filed, and had my state refund direct-deposited into my bank account by the following Thursday and the federal refund came a week later. I will definitely use TurboTax next year!"
5,Turbo Tax,"This is a great program, I used to get all the info together and give it to my tax preparer and pay him 6 times what Turbo Tax software cost me. Now have already saved money by doing my own on TT and it is very user friendly, and saves money enough to pay what I owe the IRS."
1,"Unable to import Quicken data, AWFUL tech support","I have used Quicken for a decade and TurboTax for most of the past few years, but I am seriously considering switching to MS Money and TaxCut. When trying to import my validated Quicken Premier H&B 2005 data into TurboTax Premier 2005 I invariably receive an error message and Quicken crashes. Spending hours on the phone with TurboTax's pleasant but unknowledgable ""tech support"" has been an exercise in futility. There is clearly a problem with the TT software, but the nice young people on the other end of the phone keep trying unsuccessfully to search their ""knowledge base"" for solutions and refuse to let me speak to anyone more senior and experienced or even give me info on where I can forward the error message to a programmer to look into it. Useless software and lousy tech support is a bad combination."
1,"Math results, guidance unreliable on trivial returns","Good: User interface is improved from prior versionsBad: The 'Tax owed' and cover sheet instructions were incorrectI started with a simple return, a filing for a dependent student with two part time jobs over the past year, and total income below the single dependent standard deduction. This should result in a refund of all federal taxes paid during the year, $18, on a simple 1040EZ filing.On completing the return, the 'Federal Tax Due' panel in the upper left of the main window says ""Federal Tax Due $271.""The printed cover sheet for the return says:""Your federal form 1040EZ shows a tax due of $18.""It goes on with instructions on how to make out and attach the check for taxes due.The actual 1040EZ shows an 18 dollar refund on line 11a, so I suppose we should give Intuit credit for that.So, that's +1 for showing a correct answer on one form, -18 for telling someone with a refund to write and attach a check, and -271 for style."
2,Problems with State form,"Although the federal form was a breeze and without errors, I had several problems with the NJ state form...definitely bugs. There seemed to be errors in logic too. Certain choices would not ""unclick"" when I went back and changed them...no matter how much I tried, and some pages did not logically flow from question to confirm. I had no problems last year. The online help chat was absurdly slow and they didn't seem to understand my problem. I will probably have to do the state form on paper manually.Also, the filing fees are higher this year. I may use HRBlock next year. Less hassle for not a lot more money."
5,Outstanding,"This product is easy to load and use. A great deal of information is provided, especially for people who use the 1040 long form and/or the small business schedule C.I do wish intuit would provide audit support as part of the price of the program instead of having to cough up another $40.00 for it."
1,Horrible product this year,"I used TurboTax Premier last year & was so happy with it that I told everyone to buy it this year. What a fool I was. This years program was a nightmare. I will never purchase it again. Every time I needed to go back to check something, I had to go backwards through each page until I reached the page I wanted. Then to go forward to where you originally were, you had to retrace all your steps a second or third or fourth time. It got to the point I quit going back to check. It took hours this year and I am still not confident the results were correct. I may take it to H&R Block just to see if I need to file an amend. Next year I will try a different product. ---One other thing, navigating the State portion was so difficult. There were hidden pages in something called ""quick zoom"" or some such thing. I could never figure out where I was. Thanks for the headache Turbotax."
1,worst program ever,"This was the most user unfriendly Turbotax I have ever used. The Schedule C imported misinformation, had to keep forcing in the correct info. And I just found out my State taxes were received showing I owed a completely different amount than what I had electronically filed. I have used this program for years, but after this, NEVER AGAIN!!! Let this be a warning to others."
1,Disappointing.,"Last year, I purchased and used Turbo Tax Premier for the first time, and it was unbelievably smooth. Not so this year - and be aware that you must purchase the new edition for each tax year: there are no updates from the manufacturer. In the previous year, I did both my and my daughter's returns with no problem. With the 2005 edition, after doing an initial run-through of my returns I was unable to transfer last year's info and start a new 2nd set - the default info would NOT change from the first set without deleting each item line-by-line. I took my paperwork to a tax accountant, and he found an additional $800 federal refund due to me, and that my state payment was $400 less than what TurboTax calculated it to be. A waste of $60 - do yourself a favor: go to H&R Block."
5,"Improved version: Quicker to do taxes, easier to skip through parts you don't need",I can't believe they hadn't organized Turbo Tax like this before. The sections of the 2006 version are indexed better so you can go to the parts that you need and skip sections that do not apply to you without going through the entire interview if you don't want to. This saved me TONS of time.
2,Very dissapointed,"Having purchased Turbo Tax every year since I can't remember when, I found that the current copy that I bought was incomplete. This necessitated connecting to the internet which is next to impossible to do from a third world country where I live. To make matters worse, after getting all of the downloads to make the program work, you can't buy the audit protection without again connecting to the internet. All in all, this years Turbo Tax was a train wreck for me. Next year, I will be looking into H & R Blockhead. And at what price, Turbo Tax 60.00 plus shipping, plus a temporary internet connection x 2 x $30.00. No more for me."
5,turbotax premier 2005,"works like advertised--have your info ready and it will prompt you thru the necessary forms, saving the caculations and determinations for behind the scenes processing. This leaves you with a concise, good-to-go tax return. If you ever manually processed more than a very simple return, you know exactly what I mean."
