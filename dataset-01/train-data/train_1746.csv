2,Surrealist film collapses in a mundane second half,"I was so looking forward to seeing this film. I agree with a previous review -- it starts off well, but collapses in the second half.Story begins with much surrealism and bizzareness (such as the low offices on the 7 1/2 floor -- wedged between the 7th and 8th floors). Some sharp witty lines. Cameron Diaz ""stretches"" and takes risks -- still beautiful in her brown contact lens, frizzy wig, and lisp.But the parts of this film are greater than the whole, and despite good scenes, the last half drags into a mundane politically correct story."
4,Extremely unlogical and scurill! Thats what we want!,"Talented Actors,a story with imagination and some great DVD-Features!!! A ""must"" for Collectors!!! ""John Cusack""finds a door in his office at 7 a half floor which swallow you for 15 minutes into ""John Malkovich""'s head! Soon he and his atractiv secretary ""Maxine"" doo a great business with that door! 200$ for one trip into Malkovich's body! Cameron Diaz playes the rolen of ""Lotti"" John Cusacks wife which fells in love with Maxine! She sleeps with her while she is Malkovich! A great scurril ""fantasy-love-story"" with great actors and a strange Soundtrack! A must See,2 Thumbs up!"
1,Time Will Tell,"One day people will wake up and see this film for what it is:a badly plotted, badly made, useless attempt at surrealism.See Mark Lowdon's review - he knows what he's talking about."
1,"Genius? No, just odd","This film received rave reviews for being ""original, innovative, unique."" As one can see from the reviews on this site, many viewers agreed with that assessment, but I don't. It just seemd bizarre, and not in a good way. Different can be very good, if it's interesting. When it has me looking at the clock wondering to myself, ""how much longer will this turkey last?"", then I know it simply didn't connect with me.Maybe I'm just too bleak to ""get it"" and I should stick with more conventional comedies like ""Big Lebowski."" Now, there's a great film!"
1,Over-rated,"It's not really THAT original when you look at more independent films, and even originality can't help a boring movie. Not really that funny or entertaining. It feels as if it is trying to hard."
2,Huh? Was that necessary. . .?,"I enjoy ""deep"" movies, but sometimes ""deep"" movies appear deep without truly being deep. This is one of those movies. It was at times thought provoking, but the so called twists and paradoxes, to me, had no deeper meaning other that to have them so people who professed to understand them could feel more intelligent than the rest of the population who did not. Maybe it is sour grapes, but to me if they had cut out some of the ""deeper"" idioms the movie would have sustained the true depth and thought provoking ideals it was looking for."
3,I shouldn't have....,"... purchased the DVD on the basis of the excellent reviews by Ebert and others. Actually the first time I've been burnt in this way though.This movie was very... well boring. The characters were uniformly miscast, although it didn't really matter. Almost anyone could have played any of the roles. The movie is also dark most of the time and so it makes it hard to recognize the actors. John Cusack with a pony tail and rim glasses?? What a waste! And the Cameron Diaz role really required a young Diane Keaton (whoever that might be these days). Maxine was well cast though and the role was useful to the plot.In spite of all the negatives above, I enjoyed the puppeteering scenes. Relevant to the story line, skillfully performed, and entertaining. The one bright spot to the movie.If you lean toward the unusual and chose Malkovich for this reason, you can do better. See Run Lola Run for example."
2,"Simply okay, but overrated","I found Being John Malkovich to be something of a let down when I saw it in the theatre. As a fan of John Malkovich and Spike Jones (C'mon, the video he did for Weezer's Buddy Holly was great!) I had good expectation for this movie. While there were a few amusing chuckles and the actors were all fine, I felt that over all it was lacking. Yes, I get the whole point about celebrity. But even so, I found it to be both flat and trying too hard to be cute, instead of simply being clever. All in all, too clever for its own good."
5,Incredible!!!,I had forgotten how good of a movie this is. This film is an example not just of Great actiing but incredibly original writing. Just see this film Because it is one of the funniest and Greatest films of all time.DONT MISS THIS ONE!!!!
2,It was,"...to put it mildly, just very ok. The story was very weird, which I did like, but the characters were all very unlikeable. Very much so. In fact it was so bad that I did not care one way or another about what was going to happen to these people. I felt the different subplots just made the movie longer and several of the jokes did get real old, real fast. I know that this movie is not for everyone. Some people will like it, others will hate it. I am sort of split. I liked parts, but on the whole it was a very dull movie. I would highly recommend renting this movie before you decide to buy it. It may save you lots of head aches in the future."
5,"Behold, a wolf among the sheep movies....","BJM is still a Fantastic movie; resting so comfortably in my top 25 films of all time! I call this review a wolf among sheep films because many films came out that year but this one stood out! The comedic timing is perfection and with some art house style. I love the concept and the execution. Despite all of the ways to watch movies either on premium cable networks, streaming etc. I will gladly pay to own the Blu-Ray copy as a demonstration of my love and support of this film!"
4,Very unusual and very clever,"Once in a while a movie comes along that really challenges the mind. It is a movie that differs from the usual formulas of filmmaking and develops its own genre. Such fine examples would be David Lynche's ""Lost Highway"" and David Fincher's ""The Game"". Spike Jonze's ""Being John Malcovich"" is the most unusual film I believe I have ever seen.John Cusak is a puppeteer who finds work on the 7 1/2 floor of a building. One day he finds a door that takes you inside the head of actor John Malcovich for 15 minutes before dumping you on the Jersey turnpike. From there it gets even more strange.There are good performances for this film even from Malcovich as himself. Watch for Charlie Sheen's humorous cameo in the film as well. The film tends to go a little long and it seemed like they used the last 30 minutes to throw as many oddites as they could in the last part of the film.But overall the film is great and should be viewed by those in search of a different film to watch."
5,Best movie of 1999,"this should have won best picture. the spike jonze interview is the funniest thing on the disc. just wait til' the end when he throws up! John Cusack, Jonze, Malkovich , and Kauffman are gods!"
2,Immensly Overrated,"I am a lover movies, and can appreciate even the worst of films. This happens to be one of the ones I appreciate, not love. The plot was creative, but not my taste. It was very corky and dumb, despite it's immense originality. Leaves me to the better question of: why not somebody more entertaining than John Malkovich?The one thing this film does right is cinematography. When you actually are John Malkovich, the camera work is brilliant, as well as the depth perception, sound, and lighting. Basically, what the film does is make a peice of crap LOOK really pretty. John Cusack and Catherine Keener had great performances, but John Malkovich and Cameron Diaz had mediocre performances at best. The film leaves you with nothing. You watch it and you go ""oh,"" there is no ""wow"" not ""OH MY!"" no ""I can't believe it."" You are left there completely apathetic and in utter disappointment.*Side note* If puppets creep you out as much as they do me, than don't watch this film."
2,This movie is ok at best,"Ok I rented this movie wanting to like this movie and buy it. I could just not get myself to like this movie or understand WHAT IS THE POINT OF ALL OF THIS? Cameron Diaz is my favoirte actress and I wanted this movie to be good for that reason alone but I am sorry this movie did not live up to the hype. At least I can say the movie got me thinking, and it was a little cool how they could control someone else's body sorry that is about it."
2,Not original/Mildly entertaining,"I know I'm in the minority here, but I think this film borrows heavily from the film ""All Of Me"" Remember that one? Steve Martin & Lilly Tomlin...She 'enters' his body and takes over. Anyway, the best thing about BJM was the puppeteer link, which had it's Spinal Tap moments...Otherwise, I'd rather watch John in a bad guy/humourous role such as Cyrus The Virus in ""Con Air"""
5,"Go ahead, open that metaphysical can of worms!","You cannot go wrong with this movie ( as long as you dont need to like the characters to enjoy a movie! All of the characters are dispicable and selfish, in one way or another.Kaufman weaves the details together like a master, one example is the ""Jewel thief"" movie misnomer that spreads though several characters and gets back to John himself.As for the humour, it is as funny and more intelligent than anything released in years."
5,Who writes this stuff?,"I already know Charlie Kaufmann wrote this, but still. I seriously think this is one of the only movies that I enjoyed enough to watch all of the credits. Great story, great cast, great soundtrack, great writing; you get the hint. Everything about this movie blew my mind.Craig... something or another works in a cramped (to say the least) office between the 7th and 8th floor of a big corporate office building. He is a puppeteer at heart, but to make ends meet he takes this job, and loves it! He works as a filing clerk, but two factors heighten the working experience. He is smitten with his co-worker (Katherine Keener), and he discovers a trap door that leads him into the mind of celebrity John Malkovich (John Malkovich)! Holy Wow!But what does a door into the brain of John Malkovich mean? Does Malkovich know? Is it a hallucination? Is it something else? Believe me, I really want to blurt it out, but I won't. See this movie, it's great."
2,"Great Idea, Witless Execution","There's a brilliant idea at the core of Being John Malkovich, and when I first saw this flick I expected to like it a LOT. Few movies have disappointed me so thoroughly. To begin with, there's absolutely no one to like here...John Cusack whines his way through his role and plays nothing more than his greasy, stringy hair; Cameron Diaz is little more than a doormat; and the much-touted Catherine Keener is all stiletto heels. Then too, there's Spike Jonze's direction -- off just a shnoop (to quote Chico)...IN EVERY SCENE. What should be funny is either thrown away or, more often, belabored beyond even a smile. What should be touching is handled with sledgehammer finesse. This is one movie I won't be watching a second, third or fourth time."
5,being J.M.,I loved this film. It was great and strange. I loved the 7 1/2 floor and all the characters. It's interesting seeing the changes people have as they be john for 15 mintues. People always want to see what it's like to be someone else and we finally get to see it happen.
4,"An Innocently Adventurous Modern Fairy Tale, it's a True One-of-a-Kind","Alternating between quirky, drab, conceptual and surreal, this fantasy what-if doesn't even march to the beat of any drummer in the classical sense. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz are unrecognizably pedestrian as a mismatched husband and wife at the end of their rope, both after the same thing in spite of one another. Their marriage, and the factors that lead to its quick, sad disintegration, may be the traditional center of the story, but along the way the plot jolts in so many wildly different directions that it's actually rendered secondary. Like a journey through the mind of a creative genius with serious ADD, it samples a dozen concepts strong enough to power their own film, then still finds a way to somehow marry them all into a single adventurous, mostly coherent, finale. Unclassifiable in the very best way, it's not something I could watch more than once every four or five years."
5,MAGICAL,"To call BEING JOHN MALKOVICH a work of genius seems inadequate. Kaufman's script is so strikingly original, and Spike Jonze's direction so adroit it restored my faith in Hollywood. The cast from John Cusack, Cameron Diaz ( in my favorite Diaz-role ), John Malkovich, Catherine Keener, and Orson Bean, are terrific.The only experience I can equate this movie to is my first bungey jump. You'll laugh, you may even cry, but you won't be bored by this film."
1,Weirdness for the sake of wierdness,This is possibly one of the most overrated films I have ever seen.I feel complete indifference to all the characters. The plot is a meandering shambles and the best thing in it is Charlie Sheen! How bad must a movie be if Charlie Sheen is the best thing in it!I can't even see the point it's trying to make. Is it a satire on the nature of celebrity or a surreal sci-fi movie?Either way it fails. If you want to track down surreal try Terry Gilliam. In fact the whole film would have worked much better as Gilliam/Python animation than a live action movie.If you want a satire on celebrity try DeNiro's 'King of Comedy.'On a final note the whole movie just looks terrible! The lighting is awful and I think I even saw a boom shadow in one shot.For old hippies and stupid people who think they're clever only.
2,So weird it was ordinary,"This movie was so hyped, so built up, and it's just so mediocre. It has a bizarre idea and turns itself into a mockery of the craft of abstract movie making. It's so pretentious and stuffy, I want to gag myself with a pipe-cleaner. I like malkovich as usual, he's a very formidable and demanding presence, but other than that the movie blew. I was bored and apathetic by the closing ten minutes. May Spike Jonze succeed with his follow up Adaption."
2,Who Wants to Be John Malkovich?,"Original? Yes! Entertaining? No! What turns out to be a great idea becomes a terrible movie. BEING JOHN MALKOVICH has a great premise,but the execution suffers from a dreary romance and some downbeat characters. The idea of going into that tunnel and ending up in the mind of a second rate actor, then being forced onto the New Jersey turnpike is funny the first time, but it doesn't go anywhere. The love triangles are not worth looking out for and the characters (especially Maxine/Catherine Keener - -who played the same kind of ""@#$%"" on an episode of SEINFELD) are not sympathetic. Also, Cameron Diaz looks awful. As usual,John Cusack plays the same character he always plays in most of his movies except in this film, he looks like a bum. The ESPN commercials using the idea were funnier. A movie to watch just one time and that's it!"
3,I Don't Even Know What to Think,"WOAH this movie is crazy. very hard to gather, but you just have to stick with it and say WHAAATTT? just about every 10 minutes. they should seriously check the mental stability of the guy that actually thought and wrote this insanity up. i gave 3 stars because i dont know weather to laugh or cry. buckle your seatbelts and ps- john malkovich was great in 'in mice of men' and 'in the line of fire'"
5,What would you see if you could enter your own mind?,"Malkovic?If you don't mind the exceedingly creepy idea of your wife leaving you for another woman whilst occupying the body of a man (John Malkovic to be precise) then this movie is for you.It's completely absurd, abstract and entertaining, if only for the fact that you will see Cameron Diaz at her absolute worst in terms of image (although quality acting).Certainly a very entertaining way to spend a couple of hours!The HD-DVD version isn't the best or worst transfer out there, it just is what it is, so if you like the movie, go and buy."
5,Great for OD PTs,"I had been looking for a book such as this for a long time. While the paramedic field guides are useful for a 1st year medic, they quickly loose their value once the new medic becomes proficent. However, the EMS Medication Field Guide is useful to quickly determine most every prescription a PT could have and it's general effects. It is a valuable tool for the OD PTs. I strongly recommend this book and have given it as a gift for a medic student."
2,Disappointed,"fuhgettaboutit. The best vintage Poundstone-Rudner-Tenuta-Degeneres tape is still the ""Women of the Night"" one (which seems to be out of print here, but I still see it in video stores). The one I would love to see on video is Paula at Harvard for the Hasty Pudding performance -- distributors, where are you?"
2,No Judy Tenuta,There was no appearance of Judy Tenuta on the copy I bought it was purely Paula. I bought it for Judy and was thoroughly disappointed.
4,nice hammer,"I just received my hammer today, great shipping and price. The head is a very good quality, the best i have seen on many reproductions. Made in china engraving on the metal side support isn't very large or noticeable to me. One thing though, the pins holding head to haft are not on very tight. Love the hammer, happy with the price. I've been looking for an all metal hammer, but so far everything I've found doesn't have a quality head like this one. Sharp pick and bottom pommel, would probably pierce armor... once. All in all a good find."
2,Fail,"I bought one of these from BudK. Looked sturdy enough, so I decided to try it out when I was demolishing my bathroom. It broke after about 5 hits vs my old fiberglass shower. If it's called a warhammer yet isn't sturdy enough to be used as a warhammer, then it's not a warhammer. It's a prop - an affectation. Like buying one of those base model Mustangs from back in the day that only had a sickly V6. Pointless. No offense to those who just wanted something to look at, but I have no enthusiasm for it."
5,Nice affordable laptop,"I have had it for 9 months, and it works great for me so far. The screen is bright and the sound quality is great. It is good for students or young professionals who do not want to spend too much on laptops. It works great for most games and word processing. I am currently looking for memory upgrades because it only came with 2x256=512m ram."
4,WHERE DID THESE UNUSUAL SEXUAL FANTASIES COME FROM?,"John MoneyVandalized Lovemaps:Paraphilic Outcomes of Seven Cases in Pediatric Sexology(Buffalo, NY: Prometheus Books, 1989) 224 pagesSummarizing his theory of lovemaps,Money reviews earlier theories of the causes of unusual sex-scripts,sorting out foolish ideas from insights that deserve more research.Most of this book consists of detailed case studiesof seven individuals with sexual birth-defects,exploring the sources of their unusual sex-scripts.This is a rather technical book,which adds few new elements to the theory of lovemaps or sex-scripts,but it has the virtue of being shorter than many others.Search the Internet for more books like this:""SEXOLOGY---SEX-SCRIPTS---BEST BOOKS"".James Leonard Park, author ofImprinted Sexual Fantasies:A New Key for Sexology."
4,Good for the price,"I got this for $35 for a pack of 24 boxes. Each box contains 2 pouches and each pouch makes two large (2 cup) serving of soup. So basically, if you half the pouches, you are paying for 96 (24 x 2 x 2) servings, which is not a bad deal at all. Compared to the Sun-Bird brand egg drop soup mix, it is a little harder to mix (harder to get the clumps out), and a little less flavorful in my opinion, but you get more than twice for the price (the cheapest I found Sun-Bird is 48 servings for $45). To help with the flavor, I stir in a little soy sauce, and chives. It tastes good.The instructions on the box are odd. It says to add noodles (I've never heard of adding noodles to egg drop soup), and then continue to simmer it after adding the egg, but you shouldn't need to do any more than just bring it to a boil, stir in the egg, turn off the heat and let it cool. The egg is done enough by then."
2,Ponderous and pointless,"It's a step up from pap like Saving Private Ryan, but that's pretty faint praise. The characters are cardboard archetypes of the sparest detail. The lengthy dialogues and monologues about life and war have a painfully awkward Holden Caulfield air about them, banalities dressed up in pretentious agonizing. If you enjoy this movie and are above the age of 15 then you have serious problems."
2,"OH COME ON, BETTER THAN ""SAVING PRIVATE RYAN""??","I have to admit, the cinematography was well done and the film was beautiful. But this aint no war film. There's about twenty minutes of war battles through the 2 hour and 50 min. film and it just drags on and on until I want to be shot myself. This is isn't war, it's a National Geographic Special on the Rainforest. Saving Private Ryan is better, and it was recognized with 5 Academy Awards. TTRL won none. It does reflect on the film because Oscars stand for film excellence, and Saving Private Ryan had it. The horrific battle scenes and excellent score by Mr. John Williams. The Bottom Line on the Thin Red Line: It's too pretty to make a great war film. And it is very boring. The script is average. This is basically the script: a day-by-day account of World War II. Go rent Spielberg's masterpiece, Saving Private Ryan"
4,"An existential, lyrical wonder.......","Discard expectations, convention, and all that war films have been in the past: this is a film, like ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""2001"", that avoids the limitations of narrative and character and instead, exists as a poem. Those looking for heroes, battle plans, and a ""grand message"" are bound to be bored and disappointed, but I accepted its intent from the very beginning and therefore had no problem settling in. Whenever a film strives for philosophical meditation, Americans go wild and run for the exits. Hey kids, that's OUR fault, not the director's."
5,Stunning,"This is a movie experience above the usual. I watched this movie and even though it was three hours and didn't have the greatness of ""Private Ryan"" in the war scenes, I loved this. It really made me think. What is war? What are we fighting against? It must be ourselves...Not to compare with Spielbergs (not as good) war-movie ""Saving Private Ryan"". If you can't stand the filosophical aspect, you shouldn't watch this at all."
5,A good movie,"The Thin Red Line's battle scenes were not as good as Saving Private Ryan's, but what makes this movie a must see is the expression of the soldier's mental and emotional well-being. The movie really shows how World War II effected the men of war emotionally and morally on the battle field and while on R and R."
2,A real snoozer! NOTHING Happens for long periods of time!,"I didn't expect to see a national Geographic nature film when I saw The Thin Red Line! Director/ Writer Terrence Malick butchered the James Jones Novel of the same title. What an abomination of a story! With all the hype and comparison this movie had with Saving Private Ryan -- I left the theatre thoroughly disappointed. Saving Private Ryan reigns supreme as the definative WW-II movie. The Thin Red Line has three things going for it -- excellent cinematography, well choreographed battle scenes (which don't happen very often in between all the poetic ramblings on why is there air etc etc), and an intense acting performance by Nick Nolte as Lt. Col Tall. That's it. Are you suffering from insomnia?? The Thin Red Line is your cure -- rush to get it when it comes out on video!"
3,Potential masterpeice. Needs editing.,"This film had great potential. The storyline and commentary on war was unique, deep, troubling, and strangly inspirational. Excellent cinematography as well.Unfortunatly it has about 3 or 4 too many endings. For the last half hour I wanted the movie to end. There needed to be some more tough editing decisions. My opinion is that it shouldn't have gone farther than when he was killed. Alot of the movie's power and potential are lost in the succesion of overbearing narration (including G. Cloonys speach) that makes up the last 15-30 minutes.COULD have been a masterpeice. But blew it. Still worth watching twice."
5,Not a chick flick,"Any one who served in the tropics knows how close to the mark this film is. No, you won't see mindless pap about email love lines or some dopey braindead stuff about what hollywood wants us to think gangsters are. This is the real stuff. Go see it or rent it."
1,BAD FLICK,"THIS MOVIE WAS JUST PLAIN BORING! FIRST OF ALL, THE BIG NAME STARS ARE ONLY IN IT FOR NO MORE THAN 1/2 HOUR (ESPECIALLY GEORGE CLOONEY)...AND THERE ARE NO BOMBS OR GUNFIRE FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR. IT SHOULD'VE BEEN RATED NB FOR NO BULLETS. IT WAS JUST PLAIN WACK...NOT EVEN A COMPARISON TO SAVING PRIVATE RYAN! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS BORING PIECE OF GARBAGE. ITS 3 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE YOU'LL NEVER GET BACK!"
1,Not very good; I almost turned it off.,"Too long, too many cameos, unrealistic action scenes, very little character development or interaction, marginally good acting and virtually no story line. I refuse to believe our soldiers of WWII were such pansies; if so, the war would have been lost. I want my money back!"
1,What can I say?,Bad and unfinished character development stuck out like a sore thumb. What happens to everyone? About half an hour of good scenes...the rest is pretty boring. Way too long for such little development.
3,Sometin' Kool review on Sometin' o.k.,"Almost every movie that I ever whatched I loved or Hated. This is dead center. It was to deep. He looks an a circle pattern on the floor and he thinks of his girl back home making me often times say ""What did I miss! "" It's action scenes are ok but just about everything else isn't worth it. -Sometin' Kool"
1,One star is too many,"I hated this movie, used the fast forward to get to some of the action scenes. If our soldiers were like these wusses in WWII the Japs would still be on Guadalcanal."
1,What??????,"The worst movie I have ever seen. I almost fell asleep. A waste of money and time.3 hours wasted of my life to a movie so bad that it stinks. People that gave this movie more then one Star, I am verry worried about you. VERRY WORRIED!!!!!!"
1,someone should have been fired,"The worst movie I think I have ever seen. And the first movie I saw people get up and leave. I would have, but I keep thinking something was going to happen. A waste of money and time. I should have ask for my money back. Those people that gave it four stars, I am worried about you."
3,A great film trying to get out,"There is a great film buried in this movie. I waited impatiently for the DVD release, hoping to be able to skip over the disjointed and dull dream/memory sequences that break up the narrative. Unfortunately, the chapters aren't set up to easily allow that.Another reviewer asked for a longer director's cut. Make mine shorter, keep it a war movie - with man shown juxtaposed with nature, life next to death, the eternal struggle going on, with all the brutality and futility intact, the dragging and frantic pacing mixed together through the combat scenes - but leave the wives and swing sets back home."
2,Not History,"This movie is not a war movie. It is not remotely related to history either. Guadalcanal was not like this as anyone who knows the people who fought there and the history. Since when did American troops in WW II carry pliers around to extract gold teeth from dying enemy soldiers? This depiction is just simple minded and pure excrement. Enemy soldiers all hugging around and teary eyed over war is hell? Can we spell Bushido? Mallick can't.Now, if you like touchy, feely, not the real world aesthetique, have at it. The scenery and photography is quite good."
3,Thin Red Lies,"I saw this movie and thought it wasn't well done. The movie is hard to follow. One major note to people whole love Gory movies, this one is not for you. No gory scenes at all. The sound track is alright and some of the special effects, but other then that its long and drawn out. if you're interested in a good gory movie look at HAMBURGER HILL or FULL METAL JACKET or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN."
1,thanks for wasting my time,This is so boring I've never seen. the director'd better learn about more history.
1,Not very realistic.,"As an ex-marine I did not know these types of characters. Obviously Malick was never in the service, or maybe just the navy. These actors could have been in the boyscouts on a picnic. Who stops to smell the roses in combat if your fighting on the ground. See ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Platoon"" or ""Paths of Glory"" for something closer to the truth."
1,Not one redeeming characteristic to be found... pathetic!,"I felt like I had been mugged after watching this film. My money was gone, and I got nothing but irritation and angst in return. It was far too long, the editing was awful, and it was like watching a bad PBS documentary with foul language thrown in. The attempts at artistic expression were laughable. This movie was just not entertaining at all. Save your money."
1,wot a long and boring slow film,this film has to be seen to be slow and stoping at every chance it can there is no story line to folow and the acting is very on the ham side
5,"Powerful! A beautiful, haunting masterpiece!","Beautiful, haunting, poetic, surreal, thought provoking. This movie goes much deeper than the typical war flick, delving into the minds of the soldiers on the frontline; their fears, thoughts and where they draw their inner strength, and the reality and brutality of war. Jim Caviezel's performance as Private Witt is outstanding; his eyes conveying everything without a word! I was thoroughly transfixed throughout the entire length of the movie. If you're only interested in shallow warmonger flicks of artificial bravado, look elsewhere (although it does have its share of violence) If you're interested in the reality and tragedy of war, stunning cinematography and the most ethereal soundtrack I've ever heard in a move, this will not disappoint!"
1,One of the worst movies I have seen,"This must have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Too long, too stupid. It was like pulling teeth."
5,The Thin Red Line,"Watched the movie, read the book, watched the movie when it came out on criterion. I consider both to be some of the very best examples of art perceiving truth about war."
4,A good anti-war film,"Make no mistake, this is an anti-war film done well. I didn't give it 5 stars because the last 1/4 of the film became too obvious and very overdone in preaching its message. Also, when Hollywood gives a war film 7 academy award nominations, it has to be an anti-war film. Duh!If you want an anti-war film, buy it. While I found it well done,I will never watch it again. You have to be an idiot to think war is not moronic; hence, why the need to be convinced. Anti-war films seem to be...you fill in the rest of the sentence."
4,"Criterion Blu-ray Warning for ""Zone 0"" Viewers","(This is a rather niche review, but hopefully it will help some people.)First off: the movie is great, among my favorites. Was very happy to see it available on blue-ray.Unfortunately, the Criterion blu-ray disc does not read on my machine.I live in the France, but most of my DVDs are from the US. So I got a DVD player that is ""Zone 0"" - and it can typically read both American (Zone 1) and European (Zone 2) discs. Not the case for the Criterion blu-ray Thin Red Line version. Does not read it.So if you happen to find yourself in this particular combination of circumstances - pass on this disc. I believe there is a Zone 2 version coming out in May 2011 anyway, so...whatever. Dang."
4,A very moving film,"I definitely liked this movie a lot, probably more so than Saving Private Ryan. Both films depict the horrors of war, and although SPR is infinitely more graphical about it, I felt that somehow The Thin Red Line drove the point home better than than SPR. The movie is not perfect ... at some points I wished it had been a bit less poignant ... I really thought that sometimes it just tried a bit too hard.Also, the few battle scenes that are in the film are not very realistic, I think. But don't that let that put you off an otherwise excellent movie with many beautiful pictures, flawless acting and not least a superb soundtrack. When you've sat through the whole movie and see the credits roll, you will KNOW that your time was not wasted."
2,ITS NOVEL MESSAGE: WAR IS HELL,"In this turkey, the wives at home are always beautiful and never fat and pimply.The soldiers are so morose that it's surprising that the Guadalcanal campaign was won.There is a droning over voice telling us how terrible things are.Give me break.The battles sequences, however, are well done."
1,If it wasn't supposed to be about war maybe....,"OK, there are those out there that want something deep, that's fine by me. HOWEVER, I don't think they should use such a tragic part of American history to glorify ideals that are forgotten in these situations. The soldier who shot a Japanese soldier was babbling something about murder, uh really? Bad things happan in war, bad things happan in life, people put bad things in different context, well keep it faithful to history folks. It's the least we could do for those we left behind on that small island in the middle of the Pacific! Ask anyone who was there and they'll tell you that you are not human in war, and you do unhuman things."
2,Don't Watch it,"There is only two words I can use to describe this movie: NOTHING HAPPENS. They simply just walk around the whole time. The first hour is the platoon walking around doing absolutely nothing. Then there's a good battle seen. Then, they do nothing again. After that there is a short fight seen, and then more of nothing. I can't understand why people would like a movie where people walk around. The only reason I give this a two, is because the few fight scenes are good."
2,Unrealistic emotions for men,"This movie deals with a very good subject and area of the Second World War in the South Pacific Islands, but the focus of the movie is on unrealistic emotions of soldiers. The ""men"" are acting out emotions that are more feminine than masculine. In real life situations, most men, especially when in a close nit group such as that created by men in combat, do not act so feminine. I see this in the native village scenes, the main character acts like he is on drugs. Movies like Platoon are far more realistic, this movie is too ""artistic"" and whimsical. I lost interest very early in the movie, and could not finish watching it."
1,unreadable,"Disk is unreadable in most DVD players I have tried. My most sturdy one got it up and playing after some time and it started skipping after 2 minutes, and never stopped."
1,awful,"Awful, boring, and pretentious. It boggles my mind that people like this film. Newsflash - the emperor has no clothes. One of the worst films I have ever seen - and no I am not a diehard action devotee"
1,thin red line,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Given the reviews, I expected to at least to enjoy this movie. What I didn't realize is that it is a film travelogue not set anywhere near Guadalcanal. There is a plot, and some acting, but mainly there are gorgeous shots of rainforest. Interspersed are philosophical narration, and flashbacks, which serve to make the movie even longer.The beginning and end of this movie are too far apart."
1,Why can't I give it 0 stars?,"There really isn't much to say about this movie. I'd just rather die a slow painful death than see this movie again. A week ago I went to COSTCO and there is a five dvd war set at a very good price but I refuse to buy it simply because this movie is part of the set. I'd rather pay more for the other movies individually than get this one for free. Thats just how bad this movie is.Finally, I'd just like to say that they should have (...) the lady who spends the whole movie on a swing. That would have earned this movie at least three more stars.In conclusion, go to the dentist and have a root canal because you'll enjoy that more than this movie."
1,One more vote for thumbs down,"Lots of ruminating over the evils of war and the fear of death set to brooding elevator music against a backdrop of promotional film from the South Pacific Tourism Bureau. One good scene, however: American soldiers charging into a Japanese-occupied hamlet. Absolutely gripping. I suppose the director's assistant was responsible for that one success. While the movie is not a total failure, it comes damn close. So save your time and money. The tragedy of this film is far more about missed artistic opportunities than it is about the Battle of Guadalcanal (of which we learn next to nothing from this movie, by the way). As is often the case, we are better off just reading the book."
1,The Thin Dead Line,"This was absolutely the worst movie that I have watched in recent history. I was so disappointed when I watched this movie, I must have had the wrong intentions: I expected to be entertained. Instead I was lulled into a sleepy, lobotomizing stupor. This movie took place in WWII so one would expect some sort of action right? Well the only highlight in this movie for me was when Sean Penn blew his [rear] off with his own grenade, and I only cheered because of the distast I have for Sean Penn! If you enjoy watching the fuzz on channel 1, then perhaps this movie is for you (they both have the same entertainment value). However I recommend you pass on this lemon."
3,still waiting for malick to grow up,"oh, how does one deal with director terrence malick? has there ever been a director so able to create magnificent visuals yet so incapable of framing even the most elementary narrative? i doubt any other director could have attempted to film james jones's sprawling novel set against guadalcanal, and no other director could have come so close while failing so miserably. sean penn is great. the look is great. moment after moment continue to haunt, but wasnt this what we were saying about ""days of heaven"" 20 years earlier?"
1,"Suck, suck suck","If it were possible to give a rating of no stars, then that still would not be sufficient. This is perhaps one of the worst movies ever made not because of what it is, but rather what it tries to be. I suppose someone should have informed the director when he returned from his 20 year hiatus that these days, war movies have action, characters who you can relate to, and an overall storyline. Every time I would get the tiniest bit interested in what was going on, there would be a flashback to Sometown, USA, and I had no idea where that was and I could only guess who the people were. I guess that I might not be the best person to criticize this because I walked out after almost two hours of total boredom, but then maybe that makes me the perfect critic. Bottom Line: If you value your time and/or money in any way, shape, or form, rent Saving Private Ryan and see what a real war movie should be."
1,The year's most disappointing film,"Malick's return to the screen should have been with some other project... ANY other project. Filled with beautiful images, this film offers very little else. With a staggering amount of historical and continuity errors, not to mention military decisions that would never have been seen on a WW2 battlefield, this film just doesn't stand up to the obvious ""Saving Private Ryan"" comparisons. I was just unmoved by the characters and did not care what happened to them. In the end, it's a movie about nothing, and that's sad because it does a great injustice to the veterans of the Pacific war. If you want a much better film about this battle, see ""Guadalcanal Diary"""
1,This movie cured my insomnia,"I have been experiencing long episodes of insomnia recently. I went to my Internist who recommended that I rent the Thin Red Line, get a glass of warm milk, and find a comfortable place to lie down. Needless to say, it worked! I was asleep within 10 minutes. I highly recommned this movie to help you sleep, Undoubtedly it is the most boring, sleep inducing story made. Those who interpret more into this were simply looking to fantasize something to interpret. Great sleep aid!"
2,Too loooooooonnnnnnnnnngggggggg,"I don't know how some of you people liked this movie. It was toooooooo long. Fairly boring. Some parts were good, but overall the movie wasn't that great. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a much better movie. I wouldn't recommend buying this movie. You should rent it instead and make sure you have a good 3 hours to be bored out of your mind."
2,Once Was Enough,"The Thin Red Line was very disappointing. It's not that good compared to a movie like Das Boot for example. The acting was fine, the battle scenes (of what little there were) were pretty good, and the cinematography was great, but everything else about this movie was quite bland. The movie should have been presented different. The voice-overs and dreamy sequences were irritating and the movie was too long and boring. Watch this at your own risk. Watch Das Boot instead; now that's a great movie."
5,A beautiful masterpiece,"I rarely give a 5/5 rating, and perhaps I would feel more inclined to give The Thin Red Line 4.5/5 just because of it's length, but it's a beautifully conceived exploration of the sorrow of war, of real people involved, and some of their eventual searching and discovery of God along the way. To find beauty within oneself in a time of such atrocity takes a skilful writer and director."
2,"Somehow, it did not engage me.","Somehow, it did not engage me. It might be because it did not focus to a few people.I prefer other WWII movies such as The longest day, Saving Private Ryan, U571, Midway."
2,not the greatest,"This movie has great locations to watch. But, the story seems to grab you! , then kinda just let you go wondering off watching the landscpape while being bored through some long confusing dream scenes or other things that really dont seem to add to the basic story. If there truley is a basic story of this movie."
4,"Not a superb movie, but still good.","If the movie were shorter, say within 2 hours, then it would be better. It just didn't need to be that long.The movie itself is good, senses are beautiful, but sometimes it can get boring, and unclear."
3,To be - or not to be?,"It all depeds what you are looking for. Personally I don't feel it's worth the money one is paying for a Fox presentation. On the other hand there one or two good action scenes with some good sound, but nothing to really blow your hair back! Special features - more for our money please....."
3,Beautiful-Looking DVD!,"THE THIN RED LINE * * * The first movie I've ever seen that I'd recommend solely for the cinematography. It's definitely not something you watch while while you're ironing or doing a crossword puzzle, since it doesn't give you a straight-forward story. The performances by Sean Penn and Jim Caveizel (""Frequency"") are very good, but the star cameos (John Travolta, George Clooney, Woody Harrelson, etc) are distracting."
1,Fhin Red Line,First of all the DVD shows pictures but has no sound and needs to be return for a replacement or a refund the DVD is defective[Thin Red Line]
1,Please rent this BEFORE you buy,"There obviously was a tremendous amount of effort that went into this film, unfortunately, too much on art and not enough on research. Please do our vets a favor and research the truth about Guadalcanal and the heroic job they did against the odds. I think anyone who believes the Imperial Army was victimized by the warmongering Americans really should read ""Rape of Nanking"" or at least talk to the men that actually fought the battles. Bottom line, war is a horrible waste of human life, but so is twisting history. PS, this movie drags out waaaaay too long. Thank you for your time."
1,"According to the people who like it, it's a bad movie . . .","The average customer review for this film here is 3-and-1/2 stars, which could only mean that the majority of reviewers actually like this film. This makes a mockery of many reviewers' claim that TRL is only appreciated by a small, intellectually superior minority. And by the twisted reasoning of these same people, who hold that a popular movie must be a bad movie, then TRL must indeed be pretty bad. And if it's true that the majority opinion about many films is often initially misguided, only to be changed and revised over subsequent years, then the passage of time will see The Thin Red Line recognized for the pretentious drivel that it is."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER,"I don't care anything about who this director is or was this movie was horrible. It had no plot, it made NO SENSE, I dont care what he was trying to say this movie was horrible and I should sue someone to get the 2hr. and 50min. of my life back."
1,What is the sound of one hand clapping?,"This movie is 20% half way decent war movie with outstanding combat scenes and 80% Woody Harrelson reading abstract pseudo-intellectual poetry in a southern drawl.if you found profound meaning in the title for this review, you'll love the movie. I only made it through 3/4 of the movie. After about a 20-minute stretch of 60s beatnick coffee house ramblings, I couldn't take it any more. I nearly stabbed myself in the knee with a fork to end the boredom."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","As a 24-year military veteran, this movie was a complete miss and bore for me. I couldn't wait for this slow paced movie to end! A weak storyline and none existent plot further plagued this attempt to personalize war. The overacting of Nolte and barely noticeable Penn do nothing to overcome the poor directing. I still can't grasp why some people give Penn so much credit for this and other performances. His acting skills are simplistic and unbelievable, unless the part includes a drunk or drug addict.My advice is to skip this movie and choose one of several better alternatives."
2,"Sorry, Too Much Meandering","I was in the mood for a war movie and rented this one mainly because Sean Penn and Nick Nolte are in it. To that effect, Nick Nolte provides the most interesting thing in this movie. I don't consider myself to have too short of an attention span but I definitely found my attention wondering way too many times during this movie; not a good sign. I like a fresh approach to a genre such as Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"". But that was a compelling movie that can be watched several times, unlike this film which I would not recomend to anyone."
1,Malick gets lost in his own artistic skills.,"I cannot deny that Terrance Malik is a master with the camera. The visual imagery in The Thin Red Line is remarkable, but as I watched this movie I had the sense that Malik was just being overtly self-indulgant. I have a feeling that if the studio would have let him, Malik would have added another three hours to a film I frankly stopped caring about after 20 minutes.What is the story of war if it isn't about the individuals who fight it? Malik tries to tell some deeply emotional stories, but in the end I didn't care about what happened to any of the characters because I lost any interest in them during Malik's mushy and unmoving narrative.I don't mind films with unconventional methods of storytelling, but in the end, The Thin Red Line played like a three hour Haiku. I think I understood what Malik was trying to do, I just think he failed miserably at it."
1,Psychodramic Babble!,"This was the most bizarre and boring movie I've ever seen. My wife was clinically dead halfway through this movie about philosophical World War Two grunts in the South Pacific. I've never heard so much psychobabble in my life. Through the entire movie these soldiers rambled on about everything from killing the enemy to cheating wives. I was expecting a therapist to jump out of the jungle and help these tortured souls.I have read some of the reviews and people loved it or hated it. Well I understood the story, got the point, and I thought it was a terrible movie. Weak plot, no character development, and the story moved at a tank-like pace. I hope Mr. Malick takes another 20 year coffee break."
1,Hint: Not a War Film? This Isn't a Film at All,"Ever since it's release I've been amazed at the critical reception and nods at the Academy Awards show. Best movie? Best Director?After watching it, you realize, if you were trying to get a WWII film fix, you sure as hell weren't going to get it here.It fails, even as an ""anti-war"" film. This film is so aimless, fractured and droning it's hard to pull any redeeming qualities out of it at all. What small qualities it does show are so short and few they're hard to spot.After the constant drooling by so many actors and film buffs of the return of Terrence Malick to directing, you'd think he'd pull a much more coherent, approachable movie out of his butt to make his debut. He's obviously way too self important for that.In the end, it looks as if the studio took all the money they saved from the stars' paycuts to be in the movie and used it to grease the palms of the Academy.If I could give it a negative star rating, I would."
3,"Bang Bang, Dum-de-dum, Bang - Fin.","An interesting movie in its own way. It doesn't actually have an end though. We basically follow a group of GIs, but one in particular as he ponders the weirdness of war, not coming to any real conclusion. Perhaps that's the ""message"" in the movie. The DVD does include a CD full of pacific islander music which is a nice bonus. This movie doesn't come close to the realism or emotion of ""Saving private Ryan"" but looks quite authentic nevertheless. PS. I didn't fight in WW2 so what do I know anyway."
3,"Great Visuals, Fair Movie","Let me first say that I didn't get this movie. It did nothing for me. I payed attention and watched it from start to finish and got nothing out of it. The sceens were cinematic and beautifully shot, but thats all I saw.People have been reviewing it like mad here saying how great it was and I just dont see that. It looked like an attempt to potray war in a different way then the norm and it didnt work for me.Will you like it? No idea, try it and post a review. I just want to say that it didn't do anything for me."
2,Most of it was boring,"This movie had some very good battle scenes in the middle, but the beginning and the end were almost unbearably dull. The viewer is forced to sit around and listen to the pseudo-philosophical monologue of some Southern soldier who was AWOL. After seeing Saving Private Ryan, this movie was a big let-down. I wanted to leave the theater thirty minutes before it ended."
2,War is bad. So is this movie.,"This movie had some great photography, but it still lacked much of the need plot to keep any viewer entertained. I was very confused with some of the stars in the movie. I couldnt quite grasp their roles. I did enjoy some of the movie, although it was long and lacked the needed war scenes to make it antiwar...Many of the famous stars have very small, not important roles."
4,"Great, Great...and wait for it....Great!","Thank God some people out there still remember that a movie should be meaningful and insightful, especially when it is about war, about experiences and intense emotions that the majority of us will never have to be subjected to. Some will think this movie long and tedious. Some would prefer to see flying limbs and bloodshed and be sparred the philosophical interludes. Well if you are in it for the violence then Saving Private Ryan is the movie for you...if you are in it for the insight, if you want to see a war movie that is beautiful but which at the same time doesn't glorify war, if you want to see a movie that has a point to put across, then the Thin Red Line was made for you."
2,Heavy going .......,"Don't go into this movie expecting another Saving Pvt Ryan ..... the two are worlds apart..... This movie is more of an attempt to get inside the soldiers heads as they invade and fight their way across Guatal Canal (sp).. I found myself squirming a lot during this movie ..... it's a good idea but - the movie seems to labour the point a lot. In some ways the movie reminded me of Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, i.e. the complete mania of war.... Other times, I felt I was watching Hamburger Hill or The Green Berets..... Nick Nolte does a great job of the Company Commander on his own private crusade..... Sean Penn is kind of a wishy washy character but he delivers a good performance.....My thoughts ? When you are absolutley out of options at the video store - check this one out. But, get lots of beer and pizza and take the phone off the hook..... your in for a long night."
2,Beatiful to Watch . . . But Much Less than was expected.,"I went into the theatre knowing that The Thin Red Line was going to be ""unconventional"" and ""different."" What it was was three hours of some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen, but not much beyond that. The collection of vigneittes did not hold together, and the character's were archetypes. Some might call their narrations ""deep"" or ""poetry"" but it is really shallow BS.And FYI, juxtaposing images of war and nature is not new, original, or any of the other adjectives used to describe the film. It is cliche and hackneyed.Another reviewer compared this movie to Apocolypse Now and 2001, two of my favorite films. This film is far from those two masterpieces. It is just Malick spitting out some ""art"" and people being spoonfed it and exiting thinking they are all smart because they got the message: WAR IS BAD."
5,The Thin Red Line?,"I walked into the theatre not knowing quite what to expect of the Second WWII film of 1998. I must admit my hopes were not high for my appreciation of the film. But when the first scene began, I knew I had never seen a film more beautiful. The Thin Red Line is a war movie unlike any other. It is deep, powerful, and emotionally stirring. It is not a movie to be compared to Saving Pivate Ryan. It is far greater, and far more touching. It is not a movie that will attract a great audience, for not many viewers, I fear, will be able to reach the depth of this Cinematic Masterpiece. Not many will have the patience for it, but instead will sit waiting for a rollarcoaster battle scene. The Thin Red Line does not present blood gushing action filled depiction of WWII. It depicts the war through the eyes of the characters, not the camera WARNING:THIS IS FILM IS NOT NORMAL HOLLYWOOD STYLE!!!:"
2,Yes and no.,"I though that this was a good movie on an artistic level, however I thought that it was too...poetic. I do not think that any movie that depicts the horrors of war should be 'poetic'.John Travolta and George Clooney were advertised 8th and 9th stars in the movie, yet neither one of them shows up for more than a minute. Nick Nolte had a typically strong performance as a fiery commander. Sean Penn was not used to the best of his ability and a scene where Woody Harrelson 'blows his butt off' is positively ludicrous. I can understand how it was nominated for best picture because it was artistic, but then again, so was the foreign film 'Life is Beautiful' <shudder>. It was the kind that the academy enjoys. Artsy Fartsy and caring nothing about the horrors of war. In my opinion, Saving Private Ryan was ten times the movie."
5,the other face of reality,"I was sad to read reviews that rated this unik movie 2 stars or so , sad that those people thus rating missed the point of the whole ( to my opinion).this movie is not another war but conveys one message which is expressed throghout that every part of reality we see is just another face of the great soul of all - GOD !!!if you try to look on every thing in this movie or for that matter on every thing around you as a beutifull and glory of the creation then the death of the bird (a thought conveyed in the movie ) is not suffering or ugly but something we cannot percieve which is the GLORY OF GODlook again and enjoy !!!"
2,What's the deal with this movie,"Thin red line is the most puzzling movie I've ever seen in some time. I found the movie moved at a slow pace and the meaning of the story was very confusing. Most of the movie me and my wife often asked "" what is the story about??? or "" do you understand this movie is about "". Later towards the end, I had to fast forward it, because I was fed up with the sloth-like pace of the movie.Only bright spots in the movie were the strong performances by Nick Nolte and Sean Penn."
1,"""DEEP THOUGHTS"" The Movie!","War as group therapy. Man, I've seen shell-shock, but this is the first time I experienced snore-shock! Get ""The Dirty Dozen"" instead and feel no guilt about it: it is as unbelievable as this one, and far more entertaining!"
4,MAKES YOU THINK,This movie is good in the fact that it makes you think.It answers questions that we usually don't think about. Questions such as: How does a person feel when they are taking a life? Is a C.O. willing to risk everything and everybody to win? Is every soldier a TO-THE-DEATH soldier?It is realistic in that it shows that everybody gets scared some time or the other.
1,Waste of Film and Your Time,"After about 30 minutes I knew it was a mistake. At 45 minutes I had to let it go. I rented it for $4.99 at Blockbuster. I could have bought some of those ""sea monkeys"" you see advertised in comic books with that money and got better entertainment. Remember when Sean Penn ""stormed the beaches"" of New Orleans with a shotgun after Katrina? THAT was more entertaining than this movie! This movie isn't about the meaninglessness of war so much as the meaninglessness of Hollywood preaching about it. Hollywood! Land of our nation's morals! Yeah, right. Save your money on this one. Better you should invest in 8-track cassettes."
2,"Good idea, horrible undertaking.","Watch this movie for the sound, picture, etc, but not the plot. There is no plot, just unsatisfying glipses into the minds of soldiers. True, it is an interesting attempt, but in the way it is executed the entertainment fails misersably."
1,War movie or National Geographic Special?,"One of the biggest movie dissapointments I have ever seen. Long, boring and stupid. Whats with all the alligators, natives, animals, bugs, etc? When I see a war movie I want some blood and guts. This stuff bored me into slumber. Especially disapointing since so many great actors are in the movie with a great director.I hate the voice over narration. Get Saving Private Ryan instead. This film has no likeable characters whatsoever. I am amazed so many critics like it. This reminds me of a boring National Geographic special with all the wildlife scenes. Also hate the flashback scenes. Avoid at all costs. Also way,way way too long"
1,Editor's Day Off?,"I guess Terrence Malik really has been away a long time. Maybe he didn't realize how many great actors he had assembled. Nolte would have had some academy award hardware coming his way had this dog not limped along for nearly 3 hours, when 2 hours, or 90 minutes should have done the trick. Malik could have taken a lesson from Curtis Hanson's work on LA Confidential. His guys took a novel and whittled it down to a movie screenplay that was manageable; while at the same time exploiting the talents of every actor hired. With 30 minutes left in ""Thin Red Line"" I was warming up the car ready to return it to the rental shop. It didn't have to be that way. It was fragmented. Too many stories going on at once. You just can't bring out the esoteric inner brainworkings of 20 characters in one movie the way you can in a novel. If I was Clooney, Harrelson, and a few others, I'm angry for ever getting involved."
2,And this was nominated for seven academy awards?????,"Do yourself a favor and save three hours of your time for something better, like walking aimlessly into a wall. I wouldn't have thought it would be possible to make a 'touchy-feely' war movie, but this is it.Almost every man from high command on down is portrayed as being mired in self doubt and looking for direction, not to mention scared, to the point of going off to hide under a large conch and babbling incoherently. Hey, you're soldiers stopping foreign aggression before it ends up at your doorstep, it's been done before, and with conviction and honor by our WWII veterans. I wonder how many days director Terrence Malick has spent in a foxhole to be such an expert on what combat soldiers go through? John Toll deserves praise for excellent cinematography, hence the stars."
2,DO ALL MARINES HAVE BLUE EYES?,"Overwrought dramatization of the Guadalcanal campaign. The marines all look like actors right out of acting school. There is a droning over voice saying anti war platitudes. Of course, all the women at home are beautiful with not a plump or pimply one among them.Sean Penn is at his worst here.However, there are some well done battle scenes."
1,One star from a mouth breather,"I could only give this a one star rating. I was hoping to find a war movie (surprise surprise) Gomer Pyle USMC was more warlike than this philosophical lovefest. It is true that there is a place for both genres in this world, but those that enjoy war movies are not going to enjoy this type of movie. I can sit down and enjoy a 3 hour movie that kills a couple of people (with boredom), but I don't want my war movies like that. I don't want my westerns like that, I don't want my action adventure movies like that. If Terrence wants to take off 20 more years to recover, be my guest. Keep you long winded opinions to yourself."
1,Save your money,There are good and great war movies out there. This is not one of them. A total waste of time and money.
5,The Thin Red Line,Eye opening. No Idea our troups had to fight that hard for that insigmificant piece of real estate. It really showed the horrors of war and how crazy brave our men were.God Bless Ourtroups!!!
1,Horrible.,"I wish I could've given this movie zero stars.This was the worst movie about war EVER! Just boring boring boring. I've seen some Simpsons episodes that give a more actual portrayal of combat. If you want a war movie, rent or buy Saving Private Ryan or Platoon.Don't get me wrong. I'm not just an action addict, I like intriguing dialogue and good photography, but when these things failed to get you into the movie, you had to rely on the action scenes, which were just plain bad.Don't waste your time with this piece of drivel."
1,You'll love it,"If you happen to be a pseudo-intellectual. Ignore the comments about ""getting"" it, there's nothing to ""get"". Any attempt at a thought provoking scene is usually thrown in where it isn't wanted, and the same images are thrown at you at least 12 times each throughout the film's 400 hours. Like that flashback to the guy's wife? Like it the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th times? And the historical inaccuracies are truly annoying. So unless you get some sort of twisted thrill in bragging that you've seen the nonexistant ""deeper meaning"" of a hackneyed film, avoid this piece of crud like the plague."
1,I would give it zero stars if I could.,"Anyone who has been in the military will look at this movie as a slanderous piece of garbage. Aside from the inaccurate technical aspects of the movie, it portrays the soldiers as a bunch of quaking cowards. The great majority of our soldiers were/are highly trained professionals who understand the risks of combat and will zealously carry out their missions with little or no whining and sniveling. Obviously this movie was made and hyped by the Hollywood bleeding liberal crowd."
1,Fast Forward,"Great cast, terribly misused in this 3 hour plus experiment in torture. After watching this through ff scan most of the time, I developed a newfound appreciation for Saving Private Ryan. That's the war film to watch. Even if it's not as great as they say, it's still better than this pretentious drivel."
2,Good movie-if it had been 30 minutes long,About an hour of fluff and fill and 30 minutes of the WW2 action that was advertised.
1,very disappointing,"I rented this movie, but was thoroughly disappointed at it's blasse, War is hell message that everyone has tried to do in the past 70 years. I am truly stunned at those who found profound meaning to this long, dull movie. It crossed the line and wasted my time. Those who found meaning here were either starved for something to do, or simply creating something in their minds that certainly didn't exist on screen. Bad movie."
1,A stinker!,This movie is the most overrated of the decade. Skip it and see Platoon instead. It tells the same story in a much more linear and compelling fashion.
1,Not worth your time,I saw Private Ryan and loved it - figured id love this too. Not even close. I had trouble staying awake and relating to the characters.
1,Worst Waste of Money Ever!,"I highly anticipated the release of this movie. I went expecting a different approach from Saving Private Ryan. I should preface this with a reader's knowledge that I love independent films, art films, and film noir. I feel that the movie overindulges in voiceovers and insults the viewer's intelligence by not allowing us to draw our own conclusions. The cinematography is excellent but wasted by the constant drone of narration. I understand the multiple images of man's invasion not only of a Japanese island, but also of nature itself - I did not need it rammed down my throat. I, and many audience members, applauded when the guy's wife left him. It is incomplete, and probably intentional. I understand that the movie is supposed to be loose, and stream of conscious (as the book) - however this movie never found a pulse or a semblence of life to me. I hope Malick remains in seclusion this time."
1,Too bad there aren't negative ratings,"This is the biggest waste of film stock (and a LOT of it) ever. While Saving Private Ryan is probably the best war film ever, this is without a doubt a contender for the worst.Suffering from incredibly poor direction from an overrated buffoon, this film fails on technical, as well as artistic levels. It probably has at least 20 minutes of closeups of leaves, and suffers from an all-star cast without a decent script (no fault of the original author) and a director that has less talent than he believes. All in all, a waste."
1,OK OK I'll try and be nice.,"Let me put it this way, I tried walking out of the theater 3 times if it wasn't for my friend, he was having a nice nap and I didn't want to wake him. People, this is the most boring movie ever made in the history movies. From the story, if u want to call it a story, to the music, to the acting, everything was bad, trust me I'm being nice with the word bad. What was the director thinking? I'll stop here because I have nothing good to say, if your going to spend the money spend it on something good, not this movie."
2,I have a 350 IQ,"Yes, I'm smarter than Marylin Vos Savant. Yet I was STILL bored by this movie. A reviewer below from Canada droned on about how he understands why people wouldn't like this movie, it's only for intellectuals who can truly appreciate poetry and beauty. Please. Yeah I know war contrasted with the beauty of nature blah blah. I admit, some of the cinematography was stunning, and the acting was exceptional. But I felt as if all this beauty and poetry was shoved down my throat, especially by the pointless narration. Maybe Malik's view of modern day movie goers is low with all the dumbed down action flicks they seem to enjoy and he felt he had to spell out the premise for people to ""get it"". If so, his movie suffered because of it. It was boring, to me anyway. So, I wouldn't insult anyones intelligence who liked this movie, nor would I for people who hated it. I ""got it""."
2,The Thin Red Line,"...Clearly the message of this film is that war is bad. It is? Are you kidding? ...The movie does look very nice, the scenery. It is very artistic. Though bad art it is still art. For that I give it a star. . . . Nick Nolte's performance was commendable. The best part of the film is when he is shouting at his troops to take the hill. . . . So two stars for this horrible film with one brief, great performance."
2,"Too many stars,Too little acting","After viewing ""SAVING PRIVATE RYAN"" and then veiwing this film, it made me wonder Why? Why did I spend my hard earned money on a movie that I could have slept through. The films' only redeeming quality is that there were a lot of stars, although they did not seem well connected. One of the reasons I go to a film is to see something with at least a little entertaining content. This film left me wanting to slit my wrists in depresion and the realization that I just spent 10 bucks and 2 hours that could have been better spent washing my car. In my opinion this is a definate pass!"
3,To Hell With Art...GIVE US CARNAGE!,"Okay, I can appreciate a director attempting to make a bold statement about war and it's effect on the human condition. But trigger time in battle should be a prerequisite. I'm not sure if the director has ever seen war first hand, but really, showing the audience a wounded bird flapping it's broken wings while Americans die in battle is asking a bit much on the part of we the audience.This movie performed poorly box office-wise in the states because Americans don't care about what is going through the mind of a soldier in war. They want to see the enemy die and die in mass quatitites - as it should be."
1,Avoid,This movie is the worst ever! I tried to go to sleep when I was in the theatre watching it. Do not buy it! I highly recommended AGAINST it!
1,Best 30 minute film I ever watched for three hours,"This film contains 30 minutes of entertainment trapped in three hours of confusing voice over, aimless photography, and almost incomprehensible pointless story line. It is probably the worst war movie ever made and may be in the top ten worst ever movies. Anybody contemplating purchasing this film should consider spending three hours clipping their toenails or perhaps arranging their paperclip collection. Both would be more entertaining."
2,Didn't care for subliminal messages,"Maybe I read too much into the movie, and I've only seen it once, but I didn't like the projected implication that the American's were being in any which way 'evil' for attacking the Japanese. Throughout the movie, they talk about how what we were doing was wrong and how war is wrong. As a soldier in the US Army, I hate war but I must say that this was one war America fought that we should have been fighting. The aggresion we faced needed to be oppressed and stopped before it reached our soils. Granted, our military is now a totally volunteer military, but I seriously doubt that even during WWII there were officers as inept as those shown in the movie. They portrayed the officers as being fearful leaders who would send their men off to their death without a thought. I found that highly offensive to the US military of today and days gone."
2,Soap Opera Dramatics,"If you are more philosophical by nature you will certainly enjoy this movie. But if your traits lean towards the analytical side, be advised, skip this movie.Militarly, this movie is so full of holes it distracted me from the supposed real message of the film.I was more involved with the mistakes made than with the struggle of man,war and nature.(Which in most war movies I always felt that it was implied that war created fear and anxieties).In reflection, I could see where this movie could stir a lot of emotion, but I get enough human drama in every day life that I don't want to watch it for entertainment."
5,EXCELLENT,"""THE THIN RED LINE"" es una, sino la mejor pelicula sobre la guerra que yo haya visto. Incluso me atrevo a decir que supera a ""SAVING PRIVATE RYAN"" porque nos muestra la batalla que cada uno de los soldados vive en su interior, ademas de dejar un importante mensaje. La musica, la fotografia, los protagonistas que a pesar de no ser estrellas no se dejan opacar por los cameos protagonizados por actores de la talla de John Travolta, George Clooney y Woody Harrelson. Definitivamente le doy 5 *****."
3,"A Nice Try... a good movie, but not a ""great"" movie.","The movie was great as far as Cinematography, Visual Metaphors and other artsy stuff (for all that I give it 5 Stars). But the plot was incoherent and drawn out. I understand the point they were trying to make, but it didn't ""draw me in"" in any way. In comparison, ""Apocalypse Now"" keeps me on the edge of my seat every time I watch it (granted it starts out slow, but it always slowly reels me in). To put it simply: I missed the first 20 minutes of this movie, so I thought maybe I missed something there and went back and watched it (it only confirmed how detached the movie left me). Like I said nice try, next time try coming up with an actual ""plot"" that is worthy of such a long film."
3,Good,"I liked it. Sure, it's flawed - Malick is wrestling with some big questions, sometimes clumsily, but at least he's trying. How many other movies coming out of major U.S. studios do that these days? The combat footage rivals that of ""Private Ryan"". It held my interest all the way though."
5,The Best,I am amazed that people are trashing this film. It is completely obvious that anyone who rates it with one star is just blaming the movie for their own incompetence and frustration. Just because it went way over your head doesn't mean it is a bad film. I will watch this with my children some day and hope that they too can question the nature of humanity as well as all living creatures who inhabit the Earth. I have thought about its message for days and I wish that more people in this country would use their minds instead of acting like brainless meatheads.
2,Disappointing - Too much fluff and retrospection.,"I was very disappointed in this film. I expected something akin to Saving Private Ryan and got ""I'm a broken-hearted deserter with a flawed conscience"". Too much emphasis on the ""kinder, gentler side of combat soldiers"" versus the real courage, anguish, and horror of war. Too sensitive to classify as a war movie and not enough focus on real soldiers. From my experienced point view, the combat scenes were overplayed, unrealistic, and totally overshadowed by Hollywood's poor attempt at collective left-wing conscience. Regret I spend the money to see it."
3,"Flawed, sometimes fascinating war film","Terence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" borrows only the title and general plot from James Jones' novel. The premise of the film is based on the works of William Faulkner, with characters defined by poetic, philosophical voice-overs that are meant to represent their subconscious thoughts. These musings are hit-or-miss; sometimes they seem profound, other times they're indecipherable. In any case, Malick's technique is an original approach to film-making, especially when applied to a war film."
5,"mesmerising, otherwordly, absolutely stunning.","Not just one of the best movies of the 90's, this is probably one of the best of all time. Well, it is by Terrence Mallick, after all - the man who made 'Badlands' and 'Days of Heaven', here reunited with Hans Zimmer, to bring us his third film in as many decades.This is next level film-making, hypnotic and beguiling - think Dead Man, Paris Texas, Koyanisquaatsi - set aside a couple of hours for this one, cause it takes its sweet time. But you will definitely see the world in a slightly different way, once you have experienced this.A critic once described the world as divided into two groups - those who had read Tolkein, and those who had yet to do so. The same argument could be made for those who have not yet seen a Terrence Mallick film - Thin Red Line is as good a place as any to start."
1,Worst WWII movie EVER!,"If you rewrote history and had all the marines sent to the Pacific as melancholy grad student poets and cynical narcissists, MAYBE you'd have this movie. It is beyond silly, it's truly insulting to the soldiers who gave everything for our freedom. Granted all soldiers go through their dark nights of the soul, and war sucks- but this movie is like a bad joke. Someone read the Cliffs notes of this battle and then made up everything else based on their own fantasy."
1,Don't Waste your time with this movie!,"This is one of the most boring, slow, piece of gibberish I have ever seen. I was hoping that it had just 1/10th of the greatness that Saving Private Ryan had. It wasn't even that close. I cannot imagine a more boring movie to watch, EVER! Watch Saving Private Ryan, or Platoon, Even the old series Combat is more interesting and realistic that this garbage!"
1,Worst ever!!,This is the only movie that I have ever got up and left the theater before it was over for. BORING BORING BORING....supposed to be about Guadalcanal during WW2 but most of the time it seems like the writer wanted to make a Vietnam film. This portrays the Americans as the aggressors and the poor Japanese as victims. The real problem with this film is the never ending flashback scenes...i cant even fully describe how much I hated this movie. Dont waste your money or your time on it!!
4,a stunning recreation of battle,"The Thin Red Line is in many ways a fine film which just falls short of greatness. In its portrayal of battle, it is as intense and brutal as any war film, and the action is plentiful and gripping. The slow pace at the start is effective in setting the mood, and heightening anticipation of what is to follow. While appreciating what the film is trying to achieve, the flashback sequences are still unnecessary and irritating, while some of the voice-overs are pointless. The appealing performance of Caviezel, however, makes the low-key ending one of the most moving in any film. Beautifully filmed and with a great soundtrack, the negatives aspects should not overshadow an otherwise superb film."
3,Thin Boring Line,"This movie is slow. I give it 3 stars because my grandfather fought at Guadalcanal. This movie is nothing like the book TTRL, which is a masterpiece. But this is so different! The first 30-45 mins. is crap! It's Not even in the book! But some of the battle scenes were o.k., but it ain't no Private Ryan. Nick Nolte was good in this movie. But the Woody Harrelson death scene was dumb. He pulls the pin...it explodes...yet all it does is blow his ""butt"" as he says, off. In reality...it would have wasted him! I think this movie could have been about 2 hrs. 2 1/2 at the most...but 3+ hrs...it isn't worth it. Wanna see a good film? See my favorite: SAVING PRIVATE RYAN!"
5,Watch this movie!,"Sublime, haunting, breathtaking, thoughtful and earth-shattering are some of the words that attempt to describe one of the best movies ever made. Four viewings was not enough absorb all that it offers -- I didn't want it to end (and am waiting for the director's uncut!). Do not expect to be spoon-fed heroic portrayals, clever dialogue and plot, and a firm conclusion. Do expect to be provoked, repulsed, shaken, and emotionally exhausted. Malick weaves characters' interior lives with their contradicting, often brutal, sometimes humane actions; the simplicity and naivite of their questions belie the burden of man's paradoxical nature. TRL seduced me with actor Jim Caviezel's powerful, hopeful presence and beauty; John Toll's outstanding cinematography; and Hans Zimmer's achingly moving soundtrack. The stunning location won a well-deserved starring role; its beauty, collapse and triumph capture the endurance of nature over man. This movie deserves your time and thought."
5,The Years Best Film,"In my humble oppinion this film is the best of the bunch this year. I also loved private ryan, but this is a more elequent, complex movie that is not for all tastes. In my oppinion, it is a work of genius. I was enthrawled with it all the way through. And like L.A. Confidential from last year, it is a shame that the thin red line didn't get the respect that it deserved. A terrific achievment!!!"
5,Thoughtful War Film,"I get so disgusted with movie watchers who just want to watch a film and not have a single thought process while doing so. For many who saw The Thin Red Line, they were disappointed (particularly because they were anticipating another Saving Private Ryan.) This film is not meant to be like other war films which reveal the gritty, fearful plights of soldiers. And when I saw The Thin Red Line I was overwhelmed by the originality and complexity of it.This film goes to the next level of war stories. Each soldier has a different story to tell. War is deeper than gun battles and bloodshed, and this film shows emotion and all aspects of men who were thrown into a chaotic, foreign, unknown world."
5,an extras perspective,"having had the oppurtunity to work on this masterpiece i can only say that terrence malick and john toll are both geniuses.to work with them was both a pleasure and honour.i have worked with both good and bad directors including john frankenheimer,bruce beresford,peter jackson,john woo and others and can only sat that terrence is amazing. as for the film itself i think that you can only make up your own mind.you either love it or hate it depending on your preferences but for all those who hate it all i can say is go back to your mass produced american crap.this might be an arty farty movie but it is among the best.how it did not win best cinematography and best soundtrack(losing both to SPR) just shows the mentality of the academy and how you have to spend money and suck up to people to win oscars.anyway it won most of the awards that matter.i just hope that terrence malick does another movie soom and that i have the priviledge of working with such a visionary director again."
2,national geographic meets new age gospel,"I like movies that make you think.I like to be intellectually stimulated. But this movie throws philosophical babble at the viewer a mile a minute.Whats worse,the phlosophical reveries make no sense. Basically,rent the quinessential war movie SAVING PRIVATE RYAN instead."
2,NIce try,"I feel perhaps a spat tastless in saying that this movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be because I saw Saving Private Ryan first. I felt the inner thoughts of the characters in The Thin Red Line were choppy, over acted, and down right boring. My grandfather and his brother, both of whom were WWII vets felt the movie was an absolute joke. Overall, I thought much the same. The only thing that saved the movie from being a total bust was the overall madness the movie presented. The confusing thoughts of the soldiers, the slow fustrating battle scenes, all of these gave the viewer the closest thing one could possibly get to of fighting in the Pacific in WWII. Saving Private Ryan is the best movie I have ever seen. Compairing it to the Thin Red Line is useless. No contest. The Thin Red Line, in my mind, joins Hamburger Hill in the over hyped, just another war movie barrel."
2,Very Over-Rated,"The beginning of this movie started off slow, with seemingly no point, then the characters finally started to interact and the action started, then the movie dropped off from there. The Thin Red Line could have accomplished everything in less than an hour instead of going on for almost three hours. No true plot, no flow, very little character interaction, showed little of the true horrors and fears of war, and did not deserve an academy award nomination. Many other war films made did a better job of showing the horror of war."
5,Best war movie ever made,"I saw this movie for the first time when I was 14. Coming out of the cinema I couldn't say I had understood a lot of it. However, one thing I COULD say was that it was definitely awesome. Now, at the age of 16, I've seen it for about 6 times and it has become one of my all time favourites. It's absolutely poetic, stylish and never hysteric, not even during the battle scenes. The score (OF COURSE not only the score) should have won the oscar (not goddamn ""Shakespeare in love""), the actors - especially Koteas and Caviezel, I think - are doing an outrageous job, and so does the rest of the crew, combining all to the best war movie ever made (in my opinion). Saving Private Ryan REALLY doesn't come close to this. ( I would have written more about it if my English was better...)"
5,POETRY PUT TO FILM,"This is probabley the best war movie ever made. Its' only competition is Apocolypse Now. It has one of the best casts ever assembled including John Travolta, Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, and Jim Caviezel(in one of the best breathrough performances ever). I can't understand how people could ever think that Saving Privat Ryan was a better movie since it was basically just a glorified action movie and The Thin Red Line is about as close to true art as movies get."
1,"Awful, simply awful","Having never written a review, I feel compelled to add my ""2 cents"" after renting the TRL yesterday. It was collosally slow. Sure, it is a ""deep"" movie, but it is so confusing and disjointed that it looses all but the most attentive. This movie was a C grade director's attempt to be profound. Instead, it was slow. I must admit, I had to fast forward through the slow parts, and I actaully spent 45 minutes seeing the movie from start to end. I missed nothing of the plot, and the beautiful visuals looked good also on fastforward. Not a movie worth renting."
1,the best movie ever made?,"The Thin red Line is the best evidence I have ever seen that foks looking fro meaning in ANYTHing can find meaning anywhere. The grand nature of this movie is that it is really a collage of random thoughts, and about 10 minutes of war scenes made to ride on the tail of Saving Private Ryan to attract an audience.This movie will never stand by itself, and absent the crowd that loved Saving Private Ryan and were duped into thinking this would be like it, it would have recieved snooring reviews on the opening weekend."
1,very confusing,"I don't know about any of you people but I totally could not understand this movie.Even the beggining was confusing. About a half an hour into the movie I kept thinking ""when is this movie going to be over!"" After Saving Private Ryan(which I loved to death)this movie was very dispointing."
1,This movie SUCKED!,"I HATED this movie!Admittedly, it was visually stunning, but that couldn't compensate for how mind numbingly dull it was. I think I was falling asleep within the first hour! If I had gone to see a travelogue of the South Pacific, I might have been happy, but I had gone to see a war movie. This was an ""art house"" film that got a big budget and some big name actors. A member of the audience summed it up best at the conclusion ""thank #%$ it's finally over!""Fine.What really chapped me about this movie is that it was the Ross Perot of the 1998 Oscar race. It didn't have a chance of winning, but took votes away from ""Saving Private Ryan"" allowing the saccharine sweet ""Shakespeare In Love"" to steal the Best Picture award from what is quite likely the best war movie ever made."
1,Yawn,"I'll keep it short (unlike this movie): It was boring. People in the theater were actually asleep, even when I left about 2/3 into the film. Remains one of only two movies I have ever walked out of. 1/5"
4,ignorance is bliss,I guess if you aren't intelligent enough to see sub-plot and psychological meaning you wouldn't like this movie. However if you are smarter than the average workaday grunt Thin Red Line marches over Private Ryan in most every way.
1,Is there too much money in the USA?,"The movie Thin Red Line has proven that the overall American economy is doing well in the USA! Why else would people be willing to throw perfectly good money away by paying to see this movie, if there wasn't an abundance of personal discretionary cash!. I liken Thin Red Line to a potent general anesthetic. On opening day, I actually heard someone snoring in the movie theatre, while a group of teens sitting next to me decided to do homework while watching this movie. On exiting, I heard a father tell his son that if he didn't clean his room, he would be forced to come back and watch this thing again. Cruel punishment no doubt. Overall folks, this was a very boring waste of a movie.( I can hear the Director saying ""got you"" all the way to the bank!)"
1,A Thin Red Line of truth,"I have watched this film three times. The 1st time in the theather with 10 friends. Only one liked it. In my opinion this movie is a slap in the face of OUR American Vets who were there!! Penn was the only person in the movie I liked. He tryed to save it but gave up. So many historical mess ups that this 1000 words can't describe, like fresh fruit for the soldiers?? NOT, only officers got fresh fruit. The soldier ate out of cans, Surrendering Jap Soldiers. Not many surrendered anywhere. Surrender was not in their code. Americans did not hang out with the Natives,ect. My advice don't waste the time with this movie. As a WW 2 Reenactor I am talking to many Vets and this movie is nothing about them or what they did. Maybe the next Hollywood movie on the Pacific Theather will be better, can't get any worse then Thin Red Line!!"
1,"Long, drawn out, and boring","If you think ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They"" was a good movie, you will love this one. If you are into long searing stares, deep cranial symbolism, long drawn out looks at dead and dying pigeons, consistent views of clouds and sky, then you will like this. Also, please understand that my idea of a movie with lots of depth and symbolism is Lethal Weapon III, then take my review into that context. Take out the extended extra looks at various scenes, cut this movie down to around 75 minutes, and it would not be bad. This one lasts around 7 hours, at least it will feel that way."
1,"A thin, Bad, Plot","I couldn't even watch the whole thing, I can't believe this got a four star rating, it's a terrible movie, I know SOOOOO many people who walked out of the theater on this one. It's a waste of your time and money to see this one! There's good scenery but trees and pygmies can only distract you for so long..."
1,"Boring, Dull, Stupid.....","In ""Saving Private Ryan"", the first scene is an american flag waving in the breeze, followed by a shot of a massive graveyard at Normandy. Immediatley after, we bear witness to one of the finest movie scenes ever, as the movie introduces you to the horror and despair of combat. In ""The thin red line"", the first scene is a crocodile, then some natives swimming, then 2 deserters talking with the natives. Need I say more???"
1,Absolutely Riveting....,"From the start, you know that this is one of the worst films ever made, and it's mesmerisingly bad. Gee, isn't it weird how Japanese with machine guns can't hit american targets but the Americans with single action rifles can sharpshoot them at a moments notice. And for some guys terrified at the thought of combat, they sure don't seem very concerned to me if they have the time to have poetic notions in the midst of battle. It's an insult to mention this film in the same sentance as ""Saving Private Ryan""."
1,A total waste and disservice to American serviceman,"Boring, dull, stereotypical stuff we expect from the Hollywood anti-war elitists. Made our American heroes look like a bunch of sniveling cowards. Save your money, your sanity and your patriotism and stay away from this total waste of time."
1,"Incredibly long, boring and historically incorrect","I think my title says it all. This one is in bad need of editing. The action is few and far between. I wonder if the director knows that the old ""I'm a traumatized soldier who has gone insane"" thing was done to death in the 80's? And Japanese soldiers who give up at the first hint of danger? Nothing could be farther from the truth about these guys. Ever heard of the code of Bushido? The Japanese soldiers were notorious for not surrendering. They would rather die than be taken alive. Many of the actors, such as George Clooney, have very small roles. There is one decent part of the film where an artillery observer calls in an artillery strike, but that's about it during this three hour monster. The other 178 minutes or so are so boring that you'll be lucky if you stay awake. A large cup of coffee is a must with this film."
1,The Thin Red Snoozer,"This movie is Boooooooooriiiiing! It doesn't even feel like you're watching a war movie. One reviewer described it as a ""National Geographic Special."" I'd have to agree with him. Plus, weren't we defending the island from the Japanese? In the movie the Americans are the invaders. If you want to see what combat against the Japanese was like, check out Windtalkers. It is a much more accurate depiction of war in the south pacific theatre."
5,Second Best Film of 1998,"This films success was destroyed by its hefty competiter Saving Private Ryan. The Thin Red Line was not as good as Speilbergs D-Day summer blockbuster but it still flowed with true emotion and drama. Ben Chaplin gave a magnificent job as a private who longed to return home to his wife. Also, Jim Chazriel displayed such emotion and sympathy to his role, you felt as if you were there with him. The movie is not as bloody as Private Ryan but still has a few scenes of gore. The Thin Red Line left you with a feeling that not all of the glory was at D-Day/Europe, but in the south pacific crisis too.Jon Sodini"
3,"Good, But VERY over-rated","this film is good, but very over-rated. it was just too long, and a story would have been nice."
2,Technical achievement with no point!,"If you loved ""Saving Private Ryan"" with it's solid non-revolving cast of characters you'll probablly hate ""The Thin Red Line"". Cameos of the big stars abound which adds little to the plot and more importantly detracts from heavily leaving the viewer (myself included) trying to figure just what they were doing in the movie to begin with and what was the point.The ""soldiers introspection"" into his before life vs. his present battle for self-preservation at all costs and the ""horrors of war"" theme are haphazzardly thrust into the movie at various points and are hard to follow most of the time.If you want to see Sean Penn and Geroge Clooney to name a few and or just need to see a ""different"" kind of WW-2 movie ... then you might give it a try ... but you've been warned!"
4,The Thin Red Line was a good depiction of war.,"This was a quality film. I enjoyed it from start to finish. However, The Thin Red Line was a little to artsy for my taste. I didn't really like all the flashbacks that the soldiers had of their life before the war. One example of this would be one soldiers wife swinging in slow motion on a swing. They kept showing this seen over and over. It was hard to tell who was having the flashback too, because a lot of the soldiers looked alike. This is the reason that I liked Saving Private Ryan better. It is kind of ironic that the plots of 1998's two war movies, Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line were opposite. In Saving Private Ryan, a bunch of men were dying to save one, and in The Thin Red Line one man died to save the a bunch of men. I would recommend this movie for everyone that is old enough to see it."
2,War is Hell...Again,"This just in: war is hell. This motif has been played out time and time again in films ranging from ""Apocalypse Now"" to ""Saving Private Ryan"" to ""Full Metal Jacket."" Do we really need another one? Even if we do, why waste so much talent doing it? Many of the best actors here: Travolta, Cusack, and Clooney to name a few, were relegated to almost characterless roles that could have been filled by the far less skillful thesbian. This film dragged considerably and could have made its points in an hour's less time. On the good side, the cinematography was excellent, the natural environment beautifully filmed, and not ALL the talent was wasted."
2,Crossing Over the 'Line',"A prolonged war picture about the battle for Guadalcanal Island, ""The Thin Red Line"" hits and misses. Terrence Malick's direction is correlative to nobody else. Characters come and go. Sean Penn thinks he knows a lot about life and death (substantial). Jim Caviezel is one with nature (habitat boy). Nick Nolte is an irate sergeant with really needs to calm down (his veins are full of merit). Woody Harrelson loses his hind end (twinge!). Elias Koteas doesn't like the sergeant (not good). George Clooney, John Travolta and John Cusack make appearances (why?). There are plenty of shots to make any cinematographer jealous. Good acting, but three hours of almost nothing will leave you empty. If you are willing to see how long you can last before you fall asleep, try it out. If you feel like meditating, watch this. If you feel like torturing somebody, watch this. If you feel like doing something fun, get a baseball bat and play Over the Line with a copy of this movie to smash."
2,A Disappointing Movie.,I went to see this movie at the theater when it was released several months ago. The Thin Red Line was very boring and just wasn't interesting. No doubt that the acting and cinematography were good--but that was it. Once was enough. Not recommended.
5,The best war movie ever made.,"This isn't your typical war movie. It isn't about the external war between the US and the Japanese. It isn't about the war for the island. It is the war of the soul. Penn, Caviezel, Koteas, and Nolte deliver performances that are beyond belief and the supporting cast is stock full of professionals.Now even though it is a psychological study more along the lines of The Red Badge of Courage it delivers some great action sequences as well. It just has more meat to the story than it's peer Saving Private Ryan. The characters aren't all american boys in the strictest sense but they are ""real"" people with real problems.It is not for those that are looking for a glorification of war however. Odds are that if Saving Private Ryan is your favorite war movie that this one will not be your cup of tea. It is more in the vein of Apocalypse Now and Platoon."
1,Awful - save your time and money (1 star is kind),"Don't waste you time on this film - it blows. Even big names like Travolta, Nolte, and Penn generate little interest. You'll fall asleep before you even catch a glimpse of Clooney. The script and the characters generate nothing to make you care if they live or die, you just want it to end. The flashback scenes to other times and places add nothing. This film should be banned for being torture to watch."
2,The long boring movie!,"This is one of the most boring war movies I've ever seen! I tried really hard to stay awake for the second half, but I just couldn't do it! I really love war movies, but this one just didn't hold my interest! A couple of parts were decent, but it's not worth seeing twice."
1,"Typical ""artsy"" war film that ignores all realities.","This movie is a typical modern war film, produced only to drive home an inaccurate and completely false account of a battle that cost too many real lives. Historically incorrect, this films worst sin is that it forces the ideology of todays elitists into a film about a battle that occurred during a time few of the men fighting had any of the doubts that the actors portray. Buy the movie if you want to feel good about how much you hate the military, but any other serious war film fans should stay away. And as a nod to the individuals that rated this as a glorious film and made disparaging remarks as to the intellectual capacity of those who dare think other than they, yes, we one stars do read. And some of us have lived war, not watched it."
1,Not worth a thin silver dime,"Nowhere, but in Hollywood, can so much be said in such an obtuse way. Director Malick manages to produce a war movie replete with inane absurdities superficially veiled in an attempt to appear ""deep"". This creation reflects the twisted liberal mind's confusion over the meaning of war and life. In the meantime, it manages to bore everybody watching it to death. Like an earlier reviewer here, I too observed some very bored movie goers during this movie. What a waste of time. To all reading this review, don't bother to see this movie. It is a joke."
1,Painful,"Perhaps I would have liked this movie more if I had either read the novel on which it is based or had seen the previous adaptation. As it was, I based my expectations on the trailer, and that proved to be a major mistake. The action sequences were good, but gory, and the gore didn't seem to have a point, such as was the case for the opening of ""Saving Private Ryan."" Some have described the movie as ""ethereal"" and ""moodily philosophical."" I found it to be overlong, disjointed, and unintelligible.To make matters worse, the DVD lacks worthwhile special features.Given the number of folks who seemed to have liked this movie, maybe it's a real hit-or-miss film. If so, I recommend you rent it first."
1,What do others see that I don't?,"After hearing all the hype about this movie, I went to see it in order to write a paper about it for a film class. I walked out, the first time in a very long time that I have walked out of a movie. I could not for the life of me comprehend what the critics saw in this movie, nor what AMPAS members saw in it that qualified it to be nominated for best picture. This is what happens when ego gets in the way of creativity. Meandering storylines that peter off into nothingness, characters that are indistinguishable from one another, and no clear concept of where the story is going. All the big names in this movie were wasted, only useful for the drawing power of their names on the marquee. Terence Malick should stay gone for another 20 years as far as I'm concerned. I am more convinced now than ever that Days of Heaven was just beginner's luck."
1,Most boring movie of ALL TIME,"This big bad 3 hour movie has about five minutes of combat action in it. During which, the Japanese soldiers act like a bunch of cowards who surrender (!?!?!?) at the first hint of danger. George Clooney and John Travolta are each only given about two minutes in this humongous film. Buy it if you are an insomniac looking for a cure."
1,Thin Red Whine,"Absolutely boring. This one makes my Top 10 ""Golden Turkey"" list. Pointless, boring, over naturalistic, hugely overly long art cinema, that starts nowhere with too many confusing characters and agonisingly terminates in a big ball of crap. The only effect it may have on an audience is to go to war after the film is over to get their money back. This is a dog where even the fleas fell asleep. Highly recommended if you suffer from insomnia."
1,One of the WORST movies ever.,"(I would have given this 0 stars, but you have to put at least 1) Simply put: This movie was long, confusing, boring.... and well, it just tried to be too ""artsy."" And the worst part is, when you think the movie is finally over, you get a whole hour more to suffer. I almost walked out on this movie, but I went on opening night, and I sure wasn't going waste my money. I kept thinking that maybe in the end I would at least get something out of it. Well, I was wrong. This movie was a waste of time."
2,Too many faces,"This movie has a great plot. But it doesn't have character actors, it doesn't have characters.You have Nick Nolte as Nick Nolte. George Clooney as George Clooney. The list goes on... and on... and on. Every big name actor portrays themselves, and because of it the movie is pretentious... a beautiful war story is hijacked by the actors. I haven't been this bored since the last time my roommate put in Scream... again."
1,"""DEEP THOUGHTS"" The Movie!","War as group therapy. Man, I've seen shell-shock, but this is the first time I experienced snore-shock! Get ""The Dirty Dozen"" instead and feel no guilt about it: it is as unbelievable as this one, and far more entertainig!"
3,WAR AND POETRY,"An all star cast and a great novel make ""The Thin Red Line"" the unique film it is. People have been comparing ""Saving Private Ryan"" to this film. WHY? Each film had it's own agenda! Ryan true was probably more realistic. While this film wanted to make a poetic statement.Everyone is saying the film wasn't REAL enough! ARE YOU BLIND! Can't you see that's not what they wanted to do with this film. There is a bad point though....the time element.I've noticed a lot of film are overdone! Maybe they feel if they make the movie long they have a epic masterpiece on their hands.What they don't realize is all they have IS A LONG MOVIE! And in many cases a BORING one! Around the two hour mark I was waiting for the film to end. I just couldn't take it anymore! I saw that Malick was getting over indulgent.The film was taking on more then it could handle. But still a film people should see."
3,each scene over-dranmatized more than the previous,"Although Nick Nolte plays the part of a self- centered commander with intense conviction, there are many holes not filled by this movie. thumbs down!"
3,Couldn't wait for the movie to end.,The story was too confusing. Many times I was uncertain which character was narrading. I kept waiting for a real storyline to develop. This never happened. I found the movie long and not very good at all.
1,What a waste of talent!,"I would be ashamed to list this on my resume of thespian achievements, and I predict that most of the ""marquee"" actors engaged will omit this film. This was a film weakly attempting to be deep, thoughtful and profound. Instead, it was long, redundant, predicatble, obtuse and very lost. It was almost a reflection of the director's personal dysfunction and confusion. If you think about it, where, but in Hollywood, can someone get paid so much to spew such debris onto the screen. The eager minions of art see this dribble as culture and chew on the bone of stupidity in seeing this movie as art. It is simply a long boring movie trying to make money by luring the Saving Private Ryan crowd. Dont be fooled, it is a waste!"
1,Half of the movie looks like Calvin Klein perfume commercial,"This movie is the worst war movie ever made... I never walked out of movie theater before but this movie almost made me. Half of the movie looks like early ninety's Calvin Klein perfume commercial.....in short, lots of style, NO SUBSTANCE. It is amazing to me that this movie received good reviews from film critics."
1,very disappointed,"I was totally disappointed with this movie. It's not even in the same class with ""Saving Private Ryan."" It's boring, historically inaccurate, and drags on way too long. Don't expect to learn anything about the real battle of Guadalcanal from this trash. The battle scenes are very routine and nothing special. From what I recall, historically, the Americans were on the defensive. However, in this movie they are attacking. This movie was soo boring that I couldn't even finish watching it. Don't waste your time with this movie unless you have insomnia."
1,Don't waste your money!,This is why one doesn't listen to critics. They loved it because of its artistic features. The scenery was nice the rest plain boring. You got better combat action in the television show Combat! I would only recommend this movie to insomniacs with a high threshold for pain.
4,Peace Be With You Always,"The Thin Red Line is a well-made movie, in this Hermit Crab's humble opinion. I saw this movie and the New World, which were both directed in the same style, where there's not a continuous flow to the story (I guess that's the way to say it). In my view this is a good thing, yet i think it may throw some viewers off. Also, its not exactly action-packed, and isn't really about war, but about the human soul (spirit). In fact, much like the New World, Mother Nature is the main character in this film, which i find delightful. Peace be with you always!"
3,could have been 2 good hours,"Too many slow scenes with men having ""Gladiator"" moments but way longer than Gladiator's. It almost feels like one of those liberal agenda movies with all the slow music and stuff. Good fighting scenes."
3,Interesting insight into the psychodrama of war,"I went into this movie thinking it was going to be similar to ""Saving Private Ryan"". This movie is NOTHING like SPR. Although filled with an impressive cast of actors, this movie left me wanting much more. The movie also jumps around quite a bit which became rather annoying. Although it was very interesting into the darker side of war, I was still left wondering what the director was trying to do. The most tragic scene in my eyes is when a soldier is asked for a divorce by his wife at home who has become lonely. I was honestly left sickened by this scence by this woman's betrayal. Very powerful. The special effects are okay, nothing like SPR, and it is much less graphic than SPR. On the whole I would say I was disappointed.Darin"
2,A Disappointing Film,"I had high hopes for this film with its inherently courageous material based upon the Guadalcanal campaign. However, the movie itself has a relentless boredom, much more like a Benneton commercial than a feature film. Malick, despite his Days of Heaven classic, lost touch with audiences and maybe even filmmaking over his 20 year absence. The art of conveying ideas and powerful visual metaphors within a story worked with David Lean. With Malick's work here, it's a whimsical, uncertain philosophical reference without meaning.Several actors like Jim Cavizel were good to watch but overall the movie meandered so much that, when it ended, I thought that they had left off a reel of film."
2,The Thin Red Line,"This movie seems to be purposely confusing. It has good action sequences but each one is followed by at least half an hour of senseless nature shots and absurd voice overs. It seems never to end, and if it had been cut down to an hour and a half it would have been a very good war movie. My advice, skip all the non-battle scenes."
1,MAJOR SNOOZER,"ONE OF THE THREE WORST MOVIES EVER MADE. IF THIS IS ART THAN WE SHOULD THROW ELEPHANT DUNG ON IT AND SHOWCASE IT AT THE MET. I'VE READ MANY ACCOUNTS CONVERNING THE PACIFIC FRONT IN WW2, GUADALCANAL IN PARTICULAR, AND THSI MOVIE DOES NOT DO IT JUSTICE."
2,Huge Disappointment,"This is an ""art film"" trying to pass itself off as a war movie.I'm not saying that all war movies have to look and sound the same...but it is nice when you can follow the bloody thing. Actors appear and disappear while we're treated to shots of just about every living thing on the islands. Snakes, birds, lizards. When I see more flora and fauna than Japanese soldiers during a World War II movie, I know I'm in trouble.The flashbacks of the guy with his wife got about as tedious as BJ Hunnicut whining about ""Peg and the kids"" during the last jumped-the-shark seasons of MASH.The voice-over narrations got so numerous and ponderous that I lost track of which character was talking at one point. ""Where did we lose the magic?"" Ugh.This was a big disappointment after the previous summer's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN."
1,easily the worst movie ever,I expected a movie along the lines of private ryan but then in the pacific theater. If you expect that don't buy it.This is easily the worst movie I ever saw. The storyline jumps up and down and it is impossible to capture what he is trying to state. This all is mixed with a lot of mumbo jumbo supposed to be poetry.There is something good about the movie as well however. Awesome shots of nature and a very clear depiction of what men in combat go trough psychologically. Further there are nice examples of equipment used in WW2 including Japanese stuff.I guess this is a nice example of taking creativity to far.If the movie would have been a bit more down to earth it might have been a nice b movie. Now it is nothing.
1,Worst movie EVER!!!,"Boring, boring, it drifts..... it flashs back..... drifts some more.... strange camer shots....more drifting.... is this a war movie or some strange acid trip?"
1,i dont know what to say,"what is this .. i wonder how do you people give this film any stars .. the guy's who did this masterpice where drunk .. what is this .. a lot of you crazy people who think that are prety smart and see things in the movie there owen way and talk about this secret message in the movie or what ever i think your making this up coz there is nothing in this movie .. its about some guys who where stoned and wanted to make a movie so they did this movie .. they where stoned i swear .. or they are crazy or from another plant or some thing like that .. 3 hours of my life have been gone .. i dont want this to happen to any of you .. go do some thing else dont see this movie coz i know a lot of people who did and after that they started to be real wierd and say starnge things ,thanks god i am still alive .."
4,Made Me THINK,"Before television, we relied on radio for entertainment. Without a visual medium we were forced to imagine and think. When television came along we essentially discarded our imaginations. The screen became our autopilot. Private Ryan and TRL are like television and radio: one takes you on a guided tour through a calculated story filled with well-defined characters. The other forces you to sort some things out. The red line on a war map distinguishes areas of conflict from those of peace. PVT Witt straddled the line throughout the movie, in death as well as life. The native that walked past the soldiers without fear had apparently learned to cross the line without fear. TRL is a great movie, but if you're looking to be entertained I'd recommend Private Ryan."
2,Never mistake a slow pace for profundity,"Never mind what chin-stroking ""intellectuals"" say about this overweight monstrosity of a film. The first order of any movie is to entertain and enlighten. This movie utterly fails in the first task, and succeeds only partly in the second. If you liked this then you'll love nature films. You'll also like watching molasses drip down and iceberg."
2,A Disaster,"When I went to the theaters to watch this movie. I invited my grandma who is a big fan of war movies and I also invited my two cousins. After seing Saving Private Ryan, I was expecting a film alot like it or even better. When the film started I almost fell asleep in the theater. Through the whole movie, my cousin wispered to me ""This movie S***S!"" I just keeped my mouth shut continued watching it. The plot was very dull and boring. I was begging for the movie to be over. The only thing that cought my attention was the battles scenes. By the time the movie was over. It was a big dissapointment, what a disaster for 20th-Century Fox. My folks reaction was even worse than mine! They said it was a joke. This movie is like a cartoon compared to Saving Private Ryan. This movie is so bad it is not even worth renting it on video. I do not recommend this at all!"
4,Awesome Video,This movie is one of the best movies hollywood has put out about World War two so far. I think that this movie might have used dramatics too much. But the rest of the movie and the actions did it for me. I would recommend this to any of those history buffs out there.
2,comprehensive summary of reviews,Since the site won't access any of the reviews past the last 10 I'll do a summary of all previous reviews. Either people loved this movie and believe it's the greatest movie ever or people thought it was the boringest movie ever. The people who love it spend a lot of bytes insulting the people who don't. That's about it.
4,"only malick could make this haunting, strange movie","it's not perfect, not for everyone, probably not a masterpiece, but only an artist with malick's eye for beautiful images and ear for poetry could make such an interesting and moving movie. only malick could give us soldiers who quote homer before the battle..."
4,Hi!! I'm a pseudo-intellectual liberal!,"I thought the movie was O.K. Yes, it has flaws. I could have done without most of voice-over ""thoughts"", and it's about 45 minutes too long. It should have ended shortly after the taking of the Japanese position. And a little more character development wouldn't have hurt either. But the battle scenes are intense, the cinematography is great, and the music very good. You really feel the terror of men going into battle, and the tragedy of young lives lost."
1,Can we please wait for the Blu-Ray?,"OK, I understand that this is a film that many people like (it has been out on DVD for a while, and there are plenty of reviews of its quality around--on DVD). When I come to this specific site, I know the film, what I don't know is what is the film like TECHNICALLY as a blu-ray. These reviews do not help with that goal. They just take up space at the ""front of the bus,"" so to speak. Can we hold off waxing about how good the blu-ray will be UNTIL we actually see what it is like? One star for the fan momentum, four stars for the film, and who knows how many stars for the blu-ray."
2,Way too long!,"This movie was obviously written by someone with little understanding of the military and history. There was an excessive amount of narrative and monologue that was not needed. There were too many side stories that never developed nor contributed to the plot. In fact, there is no congruent plot here. This film may seem star studded, but it is underwhelming at best! Worst of all, this movies is SLOOWWWWWW! The emphasis is needed here. There are way too many dramatic death scenes and not enough action. Also, there are way too many scenes of people just sitting around. I understand this is supposed to be a work of fiction, but this is an utter waste of time and does little to honor the true heroic actions of the men who fought and died during the battle for Guadalcanal. Introspective and poetic it might be, but underwhelming and not deserving of it higher ratings for sure! NO THANKS!"
1,"So bad, so boring","Take 10% pointless war film, and 90% self-indulgent film student material and you are left with one truly awful film that takes itself far too seriously."
1,Horrid,"One of the most disappointing films I've ever watched. The pacing is all wrong. Very dull. Ranks below the stinkers, ""Eye Of The Beholder"" and ""The End of Violence"" in my book."
5,Elevator Music El-Primo!,"If you remember vintage FM, shopping in K-Mart or the doctor's office in about 1978-1985 this will be a real soothing experience for the ear-drums. A style of music long forgotten, or if at all...scoffed at. I absolutely kicked back & smiled when I heard this, you can't beat the prices here on Amazon of this release, and if you like that good ol' elevator music sound, this IS IT!"
3,Claus Ogerman arranged this pop album,"Early work here by brilliant arranger Claus Ogerman -- he later arranged Stan Getz, Bill Evans, Antonio Carlos Jobim as well as classical albums. (He also recorded excellent Warner albums under his hame) Top NYC studio musicians and singers are the exclusive performers -- no ""soul"" here as often thought because it was on the Motown label. Ogerman, always the professional, makes these songs into an enjoyable listening experience."
1,Doesn't work * ZERO* stars,"Awful!! Returned for credit, and bought a bug 'zapper'. I used only 1 night, and the Lentek killed 5 mosquitos!"
1,Broken after 2-months of use - Zero stars - NOT recommeneded,"I've had this bug killer for two months, and it broke. The lights inside the trap no longer work ... after two months. The amazing fact is that it was only used intermittently during those two months. (...). I would NOT recommend that you buy this product or any Lentek product for that matter."
3,Readable Trek,"It's been a while since I last visited the 23rd century.All in all I've read about 150 Trek novels since my youth.Some good,some not so good.This latest offering seemed,upon reading other reviews,interesting.It turned out to be so.Whilst not a masterpiece of science fiction,it has the merit(s) of evocating our beloved universe to a fine degree.And as much as I love to read about Kirk and Spock,to have a Sulu (and Chekov,Uhura) centered novel was a welcome change.It's pacy,well written(for this kind of novel)and gives us a penetrating look at the much missed Tholians."
4,"Good Idea, Good Plot for Star Trek fiction","I'm no longer much of a fan of ""Star Trek"" yet this book did a fine job in keeping my interest. Authors Michael A. Martin and Andy Mangels have written one of the better ""Star Trek"" novels I've come across, providing the reader with an engrossing tale about Captain Hikaru Sulu and the crew of the USS Excelsior set approximately five years after Captain Kirk's death. The authors excel in their descriptions of Tholian culture and society. It's one of the most unique examinations of an enemy alien civilization I've come across in ""Star Trek"". Diehard ""Star Trek"" fans will surely enjoy this novel; the first in a series which covers Federation history from the time of Kirk's death to the launching of the USS Enterprise under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard."
4,Historical Florida,"The African American Heritage of Florida was very informative book, which covers the history of Florida from the British Crown to Civil right movement. Being native Floridian I was very naive and unaware of my state history. The collection scholarly essays reveal the true geo-political and social culture of the sunshine state, which is heavily submerged, in Eurocentric barbaric behavior of white supremacy. The same identical racial propaganda still imposes upon Florida African-American population.In my opinion race relating in Florida have not change because African-American population still faces high unemployment rate, police brutality, destitute schools, unfair housing and so on. In 2009, African-American population is not satisfied with the current racial illness which plagues are societies. Will America remain a nation of cowards or discussion legacy of racism inflicted on African-American people?"
4,Nothing Rough About It,"Not Pete's best, but still an essential album to own if you're even remotely interested in Pete Townshend or The Who. This album has two of my Top Ten Townshend Tunes, Keep Me Turning, and Heart To Hang Onto. The album would be worth it just for those two songs, but on top of that you get Misunderstood, and My Baby Gives It Away. And Street In The City is simply sublime. Get this album, you won't be disappointed."
2,Not as good as I thought,"I bought this for the first song on the Cd - My Baby Gives It Away, which is great with Charlie Watts drumming away, but that's about it! The rest of it just sort sounds bland and plain boring. I love Pete, and Mr. Lane, but I guess not enough to recommend this whole CD."
5,Its worth the $$,"This is either a truly underrated record or forgotten gem, whichever you want to choose. From the day it came out I thought it was great music by two significant talents, and I never understood why it did not acheive greater popularity. The alternating cuts, each taking his turn, really works, and I think this is the best work Townshend has ever done, outside of the Who, of course. As for Ronnie Lane, well of course I knew of him from the Faces & had heard some of his solo work, but I had bought the album (now I'm dating myself!) largely to hear Townshends' work. To my surprise, I thought Lane's work was stronger, and I still occasionally will hum songs like ""Annie"" while mindlessly walking around or doing something. This is really a damn fine album, and I recommend it to any fan of good introspectively-oriented music."
4,A laid back charmer,"Pete Townshend leads a groups of British rock superstars kicking back and having fun on this relaxed, occasionally country-ish album. Ronnie Lane is the most prominent collaberator, providing lead vocals on several songs as well as songwriting assistance. His deeper and more resonant voice is a good anedote for Townshend's more nasal warblings. Good songs abound, but the best are Townshend-Lane duet ""Heart to Hang Onto,"" ""Keep Me Turning,"" and the country ballad ""Annie."" An overlooked gem of an album."
5,"Now, this is what i'm talking about!",Absolutely essential to fans of rock or rock n roll. Highly recommended!!
1,how i got ripped,therreason ia am displeased is becouse i used a gift card to purchase and was short a couple dollars so they took the gift card and charged me 14 somethin also
4,Just two old friends,"Pete and Ronnie just getting together to rip one off. It works splendidly.Some nice charachter songs, few rockers, good mix of both their styles. Recommend it even if your not a Who completist."
4,Does the job,"If you're wiring your house, you might as well use CAT6 cabling and jacks so you can safely run a gigabit router. The cabling and jacks will undoubtedly outlast all your other computer hardware and software in terms of durability and usefulness, so you might as well not skimp if you're going to the effort of wiring your house (which isn't tough to do if you have access)."
1,More for the children (Ages 1-8) ...,"This animated movie is not at all as great as people say. It has poor animation, poor songs, poor voices, and so on. This is a good movie for young children because it's personality does resemble that of a Golden Book (young one's won't understand it anyway . . . it doesn't matter to them; they'll just look at the pictures). If you have trouble sleeping at night I would recommend this movie to you, or you could probably listen to the Incredible Machine Album while watching the middle of Mulan."
4,Martin Guitars an Illustrated History,"A well-written and surprisingly honest narrative about the bountiful and lean years of an American business icon of acoustic instruments. And it is not kind to certain members of the CF Martin clan(and justified in doing so), some of them who almost ran the company into the grounds of bankruptcy through neglect, mismanagement and lost direction. Fortunately others in the family held the light of promise and kept the company afloat by refocusing on what they've always done best--making flattop acoustic guitars. And to this day, the current President of the company has learned from the company's past to keep CF Martin on a successful road.There are also stories from famous musicians, most notably Steven Stills, who has some interesting things to share about his first Martins in his career.All in all the writing and well-done photographs make this book a worthwhile read."
1,Affair? NOT,"It really boggles my mind how you can make a movie about two women having an affair and not show them having the affair. They never even kissed once. They did show them lying naked next to each other ""sleeping"" but not how they got that way. What a disappoint and waste of money. Was this movie really made in 1997? Or 1897?"
4,B+,"Set in rural Sweden in the late 1800's, ""The Ox"" (original Swedish title ""Oxen"") is an insightful period film starring Stellan Skärsgard, Liv Ullman, and Max Von Sydow, and is directed by Sven Nykvist."
2,"More like ""The Mess"" - We waited for this!","Whoa! This is a big big let down. I also shelled out import dollars and couldn't have been more disappointed. it seems to me that they might be the laziest band on the planet, absolutely no production value what-so-ever! The songs are an experimental muddy affairs with NO passion, originality or execution. Gone are the catchy riffs , smart lyrics and in your face fun that was their self-titled debut. the best song on here is attributed to The Fall's Mark E. Smith, other than that there are few highlights. I gave this disc so many second chances, because I absolutely loved the first one. It now sits in a used bin barely worth the used price put on it. This new direction is a big time WRONG TURN."
3,"this new sound ""almost"" worked","wow. well. hum. i didn't see that one coming. a very weird follow up to much raved about debut. but at least they tried something different. the tongue & cheek thing really over takes this album :) check out the track How He Wrote Elastica Man. lol. what is up with that, huh. it's like a cheerleader chant. and then of course we have My Sex (sorry folks but i love that one). i like Nothing Stays the Same alot too. it sounds like a leftover track from the 80s. Miami Nice is a nice instrumental (sorry for the pun). and Da Da Da is pretty damn catchy. this is an interesting expertment from the band and there is some good tracks on here. sadly thou. there is also some crap. oh well it's a good idea but it's hit and miss. i think when it does hit it's very good thou. and you have to love that album cover :)"
2,virtually unlistenable,"This CD was really disappointing. I found it grating and unlistenable. Their other CD (can't remember the name) is much better, get that one if you feel the urge to buy something. If you already have that one and feel inclined to get this one, wait till the urge passes."
2,E-wackstica!,"I bought this album on import for mad dollars. and even though it was my parents money it was still one those purchases that make you feel guilty for spending too much money. i've been walking around and scratching my head for a week now wondering why i did it--i mean, i will never listen to this. maybe i got it so when my friends flip through my cd book they can say, ""ohh...how is that new elastica?"" and i'll lie and say ""oh it's pretty good actually."" I would be lying. This record is pee weak. it does have one hot cut--""generator"". scorching hot. but napster will solve that dilemma...off to used cd store to show them my cool new elastica cd!"
3,I tried to love this cd,"There was so much to look forward to on The Menace. Unfortunitely where Justine et Elastica delivered one of the best albums of the 1990's, they fall very much off the mark here. But is it a bad album? No there are certainly enough songs that are good and fun, but it is not the overall listening experience that their self titled debut was. A debut so good that invariably everyone will compare their second and only album to.But in Defence of Elastica, this is a different album with a different goal and a nearly soap operetic change in the band. Unfortunitely even taken as its own entity, without comparison to the first Elastica CD, The Menace is an average effort at best and perhaps a harbinger to the band's destruction shortly there after.Elastica is dead, long live Elastica."
2,NOT AT ALL WORTH THE WAIT,"After 5 years, it's hard to believe that this is the best that Elastica could come up with. I was anxious to order this because their debut was/is one of my favourite albums of all time. This CD really had no high points for me. All of the tracks that I could bring myself to listen to more than twice, were just so basic. This CD has none of the infectious pop stylings of their debut, so if you are looking for another ""Stutter"" or ""Connection"" forget it!"
3,"only bought it for one song, was good for two",I wanted a clean copy of Human. Miami Nice is ok for background music too however. The rest of the album is a letdown in my opinion.
2,Not as good as the first one...,"...so don't get your hopes up, cheese!An interesting, but ultimately disappointing second album. There are brief flashes of brilliance here and there, especially Mark E. Smith doing his thing on How He Wrote Elastica Man(-uh!), but overall this disc is a mishmash of half-baked ideas and throwaway tracks.Only really worth picking up if you already have the first album, the 6-track EP (because the EP has Smith on both HHWEM and KB), and the Radio One Sessions--and don't pay big import $$$! Look for it at your favorite used record shop at a bargain price."
2,This is a MAJOR disappointment!!!,"I remember loving Elastica's first album when it came out. The whole CD was great, but ""Stutter"" was especially a standout. Back then, Elastica had a sound that was reminiscent of classic British punk bands like the Buzzcocks.I've been ""out of the loop"", musically speaking, for quite some time now. I saw this CD on Amazon, and decided to give it a shot. I was concerned about the departure of guitarist Donna Matthews, but figured I'd give it a chance anyway. Well, all I can say is that DONNA MATTHEWS must have been to ELASTICA what MICK RONSON was to DAVID BOWIE! This album is totally WEAK. No songs, no guitars, no punk attitude--just cushy synths and little else.A REAL bummer.I seriously want to throw this CD against a wall..."
1,"Disappointing, Disappointing, Disappointing.","Disappointing, ugly, and underachieving. This CD is under 35 minutes which indicates that Elastica is out of ideas (even after 5 years from the last release). The synthesizer / keyboards instantly kill this one on arrival. Zero direction, a bad case of writers block, who knows where it went wrong? Who's idea was it to cover Trio's ""Da Da Da""? Haven't heard a clunker like this since Johnette Napolitano's ""Vowel Movement"" release. Too bad."
5,OK 2nd album but rare,Rare so rare second album from now now defunct punk band OK look OK and get it OK oki i
5,Super grip!,"Pro:+ Inexpensive... we bought two+ Effective, large suction cups, holds a surprising amount of weight once attached+ Easy to relocate, just lift the tabs on either end and it pops off+ Leaves no scratches or other permanent marks+ Big, beefy handle is easy to grabCon:- I could see the release tabs being problematic to lift to release the unit if you have arthritis in your hands- Personal pet peeve: the aqua color of the tabs is ugly... sorry if this is picky, but it is true- The light color on a white surface could be a con for those with bad eye sight... please offer other colors (e.g. black or yellow?)Bottom line: Highly recommended. Buy more than one."
3,Worked for awhile,"Then started falling off the tile.. not sure why, maybe I'm doing something wrong, but it worked fine for a month."
2,Not for long term use,It was great until it started to full the shower surround away from the wall. For long term use a more permanent solution should be found.
2,"Mommy's Helper Safer Grip 11.5"" 40524",The safer grip did not meet out expectations and it was returned. It became loose so one could never be certain that it was safe to grab. We eventually installed safety bars in our shower that were attached by screws to the studs behind the tiles.
3,maybe it's my shower type,"Like I have seen others write, I'm sure for MOST surfaces this is a great product. However for my particular shower surface it just won't stick at all. Might want to check and make sure your shower walls are ""oober-smooth""! I can't use this product at all ; ("
2,safety handle,"I have standard 3"" square shower tile. I have not been able make this grab at both ends due to grout lines. This is disappointing. One end will lock on very securely but if the other end is loose it's not really the safety product I had purchased it to be."
1,"Mommey's Helper Safer Grip 11.5 ""","This is a SAFETY product.. Therefore dimensioning should be the determining factor in the purchase of this and all like items.IE: The dia. of the suction cup, and the centerline dimension between the two suction cups.Note: The service with Amazon was outstanding..Thank you,Phil ForneyMommy's Helper Safer Grip 11.5"""
1,Does not suction well,"We have a wall with tile. You'd think this would be a no-brainer thing to operate, but I followed the manufacturer's instructions and tried and tried but it wouldn't suction and when it would, the suction broke off easily (dangerous!). I cleaned and scrubbed the tile, tried it wet, tried it dry and tried to push it in really hard, but nothing seemed to work. :("
5,really works,This product really did the job. It stayed on the wall once locked into place. Provided great support.
4,Shower Safety Assist Grip,"This safety assist grip works very well, just enough help to safely get in and out of the shower. The suction cups are very secure and don't loose their grip on the shower wall. The only thing I find negative about this product is that the hand grip area is slippery and hard to grasp when wet. A rougher surface would help to grasp the handle. You must dry your hands thoroughly before attempting to get out of the shower. I think for the price this is a good value and very much recommend it for those who need a little extra help getting in or out of the shower or tub."
4,Critical information,"Per the manufacturer, the suction cups on both size bars are 3.75"" in diameter.The distance between their centers is 8"" for the 11.5"" model and 12.75"" for the 17"" model.Because the suction cups require an airtight seal, the 11.5"" model won't work on 4"" tiled walls (one cup crosses grout) or textured surfaces. Also keep in mind that to use either handle on the rim of a tub, it's rim must be 4"" wide for the length of the specified length.Had this information been included in the product description, there would have been far fewer dissatisfied customers."
1,Returned It.,"I affixed this to my shower wall, and it felt great. Really strong. I was excited that it worked so well. The next morning, at 5am, before I even had a chance to use it, I was awoken by a loud bang. The source of the noise was this gripper simply falling off the shower wall and onto the floor of the shower. Less that 24 hours after it was affixed, and with no provocation whatsoever. How can I trust it to use even to balance myself if it falls off on it's own? So...it's going back. The search continues."
4,Get the job done,"My 77 year old father lives with me and he recently had a hip replacement. I wanted him to have something to hold onto when he gets in and out of the shower. So far this bar has worked great. My father is a very strong man, so I was afraid that he would pull the bar off, but once it is latched to the shower it stayed. The only thing I noticed is that it slowly slid down over the course of 3 weeks. I am not sure if it just slid or did it slide a little every time he pulled on the bar. But so far I think it works perfect. My dad physical therapist said he recommends these bars to his clients all the time. He also, said to make sure to check them sporadically, just in case."
5,"Very impressed with this product, highest recommendation","I have a MS disability and need a solid shower handgrip... I found it!! I am totally impressed with this product. On a smooth surface, it is rock solid. I have used it several weeks (has not come loose at all) & have never been so secure in the shower. I have showed this to others who can not believe the way it grabs. I have whole heartedly recommended this to my Support Group.I'd not expect any suction devise to hold on textures surfaces or over a grout line... common sense. Can't be beat for it's intended use."
4,Curl Up & Enjoy!,"Sheila Malory has her suspicions when her old friend Leonora dies suddenly from drinking contaminated water. Leonora's death benefits too many people at just the right time. Even Sheila benefits, if you can call it that, when she inherits all of Leonora's books and papers. Who has time for that when she has her own ""big event"" to prepare for? But Leonora's death seems too convenient and Sheila Malory can't help but investigate.Sheila Malory's adventures are always fun to read. Death by Water has a few flaws--clues turn up when conveniently needed and the ending didn't satisfy me--but you can't help but like Mrs. Malory.Also recommended--Dorothy Martin series by Jeanne Dams and the Aunt Dimity series by Nancy Atherton."
1,Not a good extra barrel case,"I bought this case for my combo shotgun and was very disappointed. The extra barrel sleeve seemed like a cheap afterthought. Despite that fact, I probably would've used it had it actually been large enough to accommodate the extra barrel and the shotgun. The length was not a problem, but the case could only be zipped shut with great effort because the case was too narrow. This item would be fine for just the shotgun but is a very poor design for the extra barrel."
1,Oh for my youth again,"I don't know what I was thinking about. I must have been the geek of all times to think that I used to think this was funny. I'm halfway through the movie and I can't take anymore. To think, in the 70s I thought this film was funny and I have been looking for it on video for at least 10 years. I wish I hadn't."
1,Huge Waste of Money & Time,"The only reason why I rated this item 1 star is because they would not let me rate it NEGATIVE 5 stars. Whoever wrote this was uncreative, struggling so desperately for a creative skit. It would almost stand to logic that the people who produced this waste of time and money actually owe me twice of what I paid for it; once for the cost of the dvd, and another for the time I spent watching it (my time is money)."
4,Tunnelvision - They don't make movies like this anymore.,"""Tunnelvision"" is a movie that pokes a lot of ""R"" rated fun at serious television programming. Perhaps the definitive film of it's kind. Even more so than it's predeccesor ""The Groove Tube"". And yes, it features some comedy stars that you would easily recognize today such as Howard Hessman, Laraine Newman and Richard Belzer to name a few. This movie is still one of my favorites from the '70's. Standout bits include a sit-com about a very disfunctional family called ""Ramone and Sonia"", featuring the above mentioned Miss Newman, and a ""commercial"" about an attractive woman who wants to look more butch. A nice little ""throw-away"" touch is the cool looking ""eyemouth"" station logo. Tunnelvision is an aquired taste, and repeated viewings may be nessesary to really appreciate this very obscure and even harder to find film. But give it a chance. It's only 70 minutes long. Watch and enjoy, you'll thank me for it."
2,Stay sick!!!,"OK so it's sick and dated.The most interesting thing about the movie IMHO is that the news anchor is none other than Ernie ""Ghoulardi"" Anderson.He was also the voice of ABC (Carol Burnett Show announcer and ""The LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE Boat"") and later AFV.Every once in a while Carol Burnett would introduce him in her audience as if everyone knew who he was. He was extremely close friends with Tim Conway.He tried to make it as an actor but could never remember more than a few lines, so they made him a news anchor and he used a teleprompter during filming.He was the father of Paul Thomas Anderson, who is now a famous movie director."
2,"I like yeech, but this is boring yeech.","I'm a big fan of ""Amazon Women on the Moon"" and ""Groove Tube"" , wanted more of the same, but I found this somewhere between pointless & obvious , did not find it funny, like SNL (Still No Laughs) not funny. At least Leno & Letterman occasionaly say something humourous. I'm cutting pasting this comment for similar old video."
1,The man sold me a coppied tape,"When I recieved the tape it looked OK. Genuine package, real pre-recorded cassett shell. When I played the tape , I discoverd it was a copy. A very poor quality Illegal COPY. Bad, very bad. Someone had taken the tape apart and replaced the genuine pre-recorded tape in side with the copied tape."
5,Amazing band with new sounds and new music......,"One Way Ride both on their CD and on stage rocks. With fresh lyrics and a fantastic new sound, this band will definitely be around for awhile. Check out this CD for cool lyrics with a fresh new style."
4,"Excellent Resource for Counsellors, Clients and Individuals","Self-Talk: Key to Personal Growth is an excellent resource for anyone, lay-person or professional. It gives clear advice on how to tackle negative self-talk in an accessible format."
3,"Good book, but it's pretty much identical to ""You Are What You Think""","David Stoop the same author of You are what you think wrote the same exact thing in this book except he ""added"" a few more chapters. There is nothing wrong with this book or the other one, but an author should never try to sell the same book with a different title. I was very disappointed when I saw that most of the chapters started the same way with the same stories and same examples. If I would have known it was pretty much the same book I would have not bothered purchasing it and if you want proof that it is indeed the same book read take advantage of the [look inside] feature on amazon and you'll see that it is. Other than the two books being the same I enjoyed my read that came mostly from the other book you are what you think. It was informative and had good biblical truth to it."
1,Still haven't received this item -,"I still have not received this item. It was shipped to the wrong address and after weeks of trying to get the situation corrected, I simply gave up. I don't recommend this seller."
1,For decoration only,"I honestly wanted to buy a nutcracker. To open nuts. This is strictly for show. The opening is hardly large enough to fit a small nut and any attempts to actually use it to open a nut results in the head popping off. I just think they should tell people this doesn't actually do what you think it does. It looks nice, but that's it."
3,A One Girl Group,"Although Carol Jackson is an individual, her album has the sound of the girl groups of the sixties. If you own and like any of the many girl group anthologies, you're going to like this CD."
4,An uneven crime thriller,"Burgess Meredith, of all people, directed this oddball thriller, which features Franchot Tone as an ice-cool (but quite deranged) criminal mastermind who secretly yearns to be caught, and taunts a Parisian detective, Inspector Maigret (Charles Laughton) into hounding him. The moodiness of the film's beginning is undercut by the implausibility and uneven direction of the cat-and-mouse machinations of the second half; Laughton's character loses steam and while Tone delivers some choice moments eye-bulging insanity, it's had to make heads or tails out of his overly-explicit taunts of Maigret's faltering investigation. Sort of a lesser version of ""The Third Man,"" with a resplendid mid-century Paris in place of a war-torn Vienna. Nice look at the inner workings of the Eiffel Tower as well... An interesting early adaptation of mystery novelist George Simenon's Maigret character, but ultimately a fairly shaky film."
1,A completely waste of money,"What I thought was going to be a clean/safe way to deter mosquitos turned out to be a complete waste of money. I trackeddown a mosquito that was sitting on my bathroom wall and tested the device out. With all 3 settings (the 2 male mosquitos and the dragonfly) on the loudest at around 6 inches from the mosquito, the thing wasn't even phased and sat there. I even tried to adjust the volume up and down thinking that the sound amplitude might have an effect. Again, the bugger was still parked on my wall. I'm going to return this thing ASAP and I'm also wondering what the previous reviewer was smoking giving this product a 5 star rating..."
1,Be sure to use lots of Backwoods Off with this product.,"If the frequencies on this product do indeed work it must attract mosquitoes because it does not repel them. As the previous writer said, A complete waste of money."
1,I was sent a different Shrek.... Not happy!,"So I can't write a review regarding this particular Shrek, the one I wanted! So this is my review on the one I got through Dhasset, was very misleading! :/"
5,Salsa Salsa Salsa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Salsa at its finest and best my solid advice to anyone thinking wether to purchase any cd by this true salsa band...just buy it you will not be dissapointed I promise you I stand behind 'El Grand Combo' 100%..this is SALSA in its purest form the sounds the standard of singing,the instruments the 'impro' everything is perfect.Thank You Puerto Rico for letting us share the sounds of this band with you.Salsa Salsa Salsa"
5,In my deck all the time. . . .,This CD somehow has not made it out of my CD deck since I bought it. It is very addicting makes you want to dance.
2,Too stiff,"It is an attractive case, but the phone did not easily fit in the case. The leather was too stiff and it just didn't work. I sent it back to Orion gadgets on October 25 and the charge is still not credited to my account despite one phone call."
2,Very disappointed.,Beautiful naked women who exhibit no passion whatsoever. Not one of Playboy's best.
1,Doesn't work,"There seemed to be less evidence of gophers in the beginning, but they are back as usual. I've been using it for three months."
1,"Sorry, it doesn't work","I have tried everything to get rid of moles: castor oil-based repellents, grubicides, balls of fishing line, smoke bombs, car exhaust and these sonic repellents. The fact is: the only effective way to control moles is to trap (ie. English scissors) or spear them. These MoleContro's do seem to annoy the critters into moving elsewhere, but the effect is only temporary (lasting about two weeks). Even this effect is difficult to determine because moles change their digging patterns over time and you can't tell if the repellents worked or if they had just gone somewhere else on their own. In any case, after two weeks, they burrow up to and around the repellents with impunity."
3,Not the color I expected,"Although I like the lamp and it still works in my family room, it was not the color that I saw on my screen. I thought the colors would be more tan and rust, however, they have much more green than I expected."
2,Warped,"The elements of this lamp are beautiful. Rich slate and the lamp is heavy.. The shade is picked... cheap, and very dark for the lamp. We are trying to get this in alignment, and will look for new shades. Really not worth the price."
2,A HOBBIT PARCHMENT JOURNAL,I couldn't tell this from the catalog but this is a Blank Book to be used as a journal. There are sketches of Tolkien characters and scenes on each page and a short poem on the back cover. I don't believe it actually is by JRR Tolkien.
1,People are funny,"but what can you say? The main reason I am reviewing this book is because there are people out there who will give five stars to anything with the name ""tolkien"" on it and that needs to be balanced out. The facts: 1)It is a BLANK BOOK and therefore is not truly written or edited by anyone. 2)It does not seem to have existed before the movie hype began, and therefore is in NO WAY related to an author who died almost thirty years ago. (That out of the way, it is a nice book as far as blank journals go.) If you have so much extra money that are you just blindly buying up every Tolkien-related item that the industry decides to sell, or just really want something else by Tolkien to read,try the little known ""Roverandom."""
1,Ugh! Ugh! - It stinks!!,"It's just as good as Pokemon: The animation is terrible, the ""stories"" are bad and the voice acting makes my ears bleed while making me nauseous at the same time.People, people, don't buythis...."
5,F@biolous ^_^!,"This video has awesome dialouge! I'll recommend this to SM fans! In fact, I'm one of them!!!! I've been watching SM when I was a 5 year old in Japan. I did not think it was violent at all! This video has ecellent music. I sure wish It was still on TV! SM ROCKS ^__^!!!!"
5,How I Love Thee...Let Me Count The Ways...,"Ah... Sailormoon S. Uncut, untouched, in Japanese... This is what I live for! Three full episodes of pure, unadulterated Moonie pleasure. I'm so glad that Pioneer is releasing a subbed version of my favorite show, unlike a certain company with the rights to the fisrt two seasons. **cough**ADV**cough** Cloverway & Optimum did a horrible thing to Sailormoon S (and SuperS) when they dubbed them. I was glad to see that the original music was there, and I adored Rini's new voice but, otherwise, the dub really stank. Ja ne, K_CC"
5,"Battle at Alcatraz, a desperate attempt to escape the Rock.","this book is in my view one of the most engaging books you could ever read.I say this for two reasons- first the mood of the book is such that it keeps you reading it over, secondly the account is actually written by someone who had first hand knowledge of Alcatraz.But i also liked it because of the depth........ all in all a good read for anyone[save children on account of the swearing]"
2,There are better versions written,"I was disappointed in this book. Ernie Lageson's dad has been dead since 1953, so I suspect that a lot of the conversations were recreated. What I really disliked was the frequent use of the ""F"" word throughout the book. It isn't necessary use it almost every time an inmate spoke. Also, why didn't Lageson ever say what towns and cities his parents lived in when they were in ND? Small things like that are nice to know."
4,Very good and captivating reading,"I read this book in three days. After making the tour in Alcatraz island. After entering the gift shop, I saw this book and bought it.Of course Lageson created a lot of dialogues in the book, basically all dialogues envolving Coy, Barnard, Cretzer, etc, mainly after they were trapped and encircled and knew their plan was doomed.But Lageson played fair, given a fast-reading description of events with sufficient details that make you enjoy the narrative the most, and not being bored by them. Also, there is a good foreword about the ivolved, inluding Warden Johnston.A very good book. I wonder why some great studio did not made a movie with this material. It's evrything there and the action occurred ina a fairly contained space. The adaptation to screenplay probably would not be the hardest."
1,What kind of crap are you all peddling.,"If i hear one more person compare these morons to the Deftones, or Chino i'm gonna puke blood. I bought this sorry exuse for a CD, because someone said, if you like the Deftones you will love Relitive Ash. They sure try there very best to grab onto the Deftones coat tails, but miss there goal entirely. All of you people should be ashamed of yourselves. The Deftones are like Gods, these posers are like retarded third grade kids without any cordination. There singer, music, and lyrics suck. I get the taste of vomit in my mouth everytime i remember that i spent money on this abomination."
1,i liked it better the 1st time when it was called deftones,pure and udder triteness. color by number nu metal. you got a little bit of korn here a little bit of deftones here. these guys make Staind appear to have something new and different going on. thats how bland this cd is.
4,Pretty Good CD,"I bought this thinking it was okay. After a couple listens, a figured it was PRETTY GOOD. Im still there. If these guys would have come out maybe 3 or 4 years ago i would have liked them more. But it still is a pretty good CD. The guitar seems to be more than a boring riff with downtuned guitar. Its a greatCD. I found myself liking the lyrics and vocals. Im glad i bought this. The standout tracks on this album are 1, 2,3,4, 5, 6, 10, and 11. If you like Deftones and stuff like that, you'll like this."
3,Faux Bartok,"For me, the Serly version of the concerto does Bartok few favors. The version by the composer's son and son-in-law improves things, but not much. The best completion -- something that actually raises the viola concerto to the level of other late Bartok, like the third piano concerto -- is by violist Csaba Erdelyi, recorded on Concordance CCD03. Unfortunately, due to awful copyright laws and to certain editors apparently afraid of competition, is not available in most of the world. Serly performed a service by keeping the score alive to the present day, but it misses the essence of Bartok's music. The Bartok-Neubauer completion doesn't essentially change that perception. The Erdelyi, however, actually makes you feel that Bartok is in the room, at least. The performance is okay, but it's of the wrong score (twice!)."
5,Great Performances,"This disc contains excellent recordings of""Two Pictures"" and the ""Viola Concerto"".I definitely prefer the version with Tibor Serly's orchestration.Though this concerto is not in the same league as Bartok's two brilliant violin concertos, I'd say the finale qualifies as a masterpiece.Bartok was dying when he composed the ""Viola Concerto"". It sounds as if his spirit were being called home to Transylvania."
3,Not for Bread,"This equipment is not sturdy, if you try to make bread, it makes noise as if it would come apart. Well, it just did. I was mixing bread with the hook at lowest speed, it was 1.5 lb mix, and it just broke and stopped. Use it for cake mix or whipped cream."
3,"Amusing, but not a must-have.","Jim Paul, The Rune Poem (Chronicle, 1996)Another translation of the Rune Poem, this one rather nicely illustrated, in a mass-market height hardback from Chronicle Books. Paul adds nothing to Rune Poem scholarship, nor does he shed new light, but I doubt that was the intention with this book; it seemed more aimed at exposing the poem to those who had never seen it before, while showing those who wanted to do further research the avenues with which to do so (he refers repeatedly to Maureen Halsall's critical study often in this text). Good if you're interested and don't already have a copy, and can usually be had cheap; if you already own a translation of the Rune Poem or any of the critical works on the subject, you can pass on this safely. ***"
4,"Big, Big Skillet","Plenty of room to cook multiple items. Wife loves the skillet. The only thing she doesn't like, it is a little heavy for her. The two handles make it easier to pick up and it is a well made product. Quick clean up after pan cools."
5,ITEMS RATED PRIMARILY ON QUALITY,"One item was defective, several were fine quality but didn't suit my application but rated them primarily on quality rather than suitibility."
2,BEWARE: THIS IS NOT A REMASTERED RECORDING!,"The songs and voice of Joan Baez are great but do not expect a HD CD that is remastered. In fact while playing the CD there is an on/off rumbling noise in the background that resembles a helicopter flying over the studio while this CD is being recorded! The seller should not advertise this CD as remastered when it is not. There is no word of that on the CD itself or CD case and my player does not show HD CD when the CD is loaded. I bought this CD because it said it is remastered, which would improve the sound quality significantly."
2,DISAPPOINTING PRODUCT,"was quite taken aback when i received this product and its size; short end of the story gave it away as a gift, just did not enjoy it enough to want to keep it. Very disappointing indead."
2,Cute movie for young ones.,"I saw this movie years back and it is so cute so I purchased for my daughter and she like it. Not for real young kids, young adults 17+."
4,Wish She Was MY Tutor!,"One of those great 80's type movies they just don't make anymore. No serious stuff here, just plain old good, sexy, fun. Ranks right up there with ""Hardbodies"" (#1, not the sequel). Caren Kaye was one of the most sexy beautiful women. Would love to see her today!"
3,more hs date memories,brings back memories of me and my gf at that time as we went to this film together and also cause she took French and Spanish in HS and in one way sort of took on the role of the Tutor to me even though i wasnt taking French but fond memories and lots of enjoyment and entertaining film
2,Dull but cute,"The main reason to watch this flick is if you have a thing for gay male porno star of yesteryear, Tom Steele. The leading guy looks just like him. You see a lot less of this guy, if you catch my drift, but it's cute and watchable in a nostalgia kind of way if you remember seeing it on cable 20 years ago."
3,So awful it was fun to watch,A time warp to every 1980's cliche ever found in a coming of age movie. The bad music. The random minutes of footage of an aerobics class focused on gyrating hips. The chase scene where a scooter somehow beats a Porsche. Easily the worst movie I've seen this year but I wouldn't have missed it.
3,BobHugh,"Matt Lattanzi was one lucky fellow. First this movie,and then marrying,and unfortunately divorcing Olivia Newton-John. Caren Kaye was a dream of all young men who ever needed help with their studies. With someone with a body like hers,it would be hard to concentrate on the books. Good repartee with the other actors. A fun movie."
5,A page turner,"It may not be the deepest novel out there, but if you've got some time for a book then I'd recommend this one. A great look at the insides of the techie-revolution. If you sometimes wonder why the best software or the best computer company don't make it, this is the explanation you've been looking for."
1,Insultingly stupid and extremely cheesy,"Bad characters, inane and obvious plot and zero writing style make this one of the worst books I've ever had the misfortune to read. If you have any interest in the world of business or silicon valley and the computer industry you should find this book laughable. And to make matters worse Po Bronson takes the kindergarten level theme and story so seriously it makes you doubt his credentials.I actually thought this might be a fun read as I was going through a similar situation as the lead character but just found this to be insulting me on every single page. I hope Amazon don't take it as a spoiler if I tell you the ending is unbelieveably stupid. In a word: Avoid."
3,"Enjoyable, but there are better similar books","Like some of the other reviewers, my enjoyment of this book was probably curtailed by my strong knowledge of the subject matter. Nonetheless, I found it fairly weak; I'd recommend that before you read this you try ""Microserfs"" by Douglas Coupland or ""Down in the Valley"" by William Schaffer, or even the (nonfiction) classic ""Soul of a New Machine"" by Tracy Kidder"
4,"Funny for Valley novices, hilarious for insiders","Bronson's satirical look at a Silicon Valley start-upmoves quickly, especially for those familiar with thetechnology biz. And those people are further rewardedby subtle (and not-so-subtle) digs at the sacred cowsthat roam the high-tech landscape. At times the narrativea tad hokey (the romantic storyline seems contrived), butBronson clearly knows his stuff. Entrepreneurs may gawkat some of his dead-on characterizations, especially theindustry vs. academia tensions skillfully rendered. Forthose unfamiliar with the Valley ""The First"" is a goodfirst look."
4,A Fun Read,"Great entertainment. Before you begin reading, a caveat. This book was written in 1997 so don't expect cutting edge insider views. Other reviewers wanted to see something highly technical and up to date, not going to happen.Here's what to expect: a delightful and amusing tale of what happens to a group of dedicated and somewhat naive High Techies after they get set adrift from their cushy,ivory tower jobs and find themselves navigating the seas of the real world (circa 1996). Enough character development to allow you to sympathize with Team Plaid.Are there stereotypes of engineers? You bet! Not depicted in a mean way, the iron men of high tech are portrayed as all too human. If you are not in the industry (or don't tend to be overly critical)and actually like to laugh out loud while you're reading you'll enjoy this novel!"
1,This book is a disappointment.,"The premise of this book is standard Po Bronson; he takes his shallow understanding of Silicon Valley life, and tries to over-glamourize and ""sexify"" it.The book makes a wan attempt at incorporating real elements of high-tech, but his lack of understanding of technology is bothersome enough to undermine any suspense of disbelief.His description of the engineers is drawn from 70's stereotypes, not the way engineers are today. He has too many anecdotes that have no purpose other than to simulate a true understanding of Valley culture.A real disappointment, and clearly an attempt to appeal to both the lowest common denominator, and movie executives."
3,"Catchy, but no payoff","This one starts off quite interestingly, but slowly declines into the realm of mediocre. Within the text are individually interesting nuggets of computer industry insight, but the book as a whole leaves something to be desired. An actual plot, perhaps.If this is your industry (it is mine), perhaps you'll find a hint of truth in this fictiontional account, but I didn't find the characters to be hugely realistic or engaging.The title is the book's high point."
2,"Stale, outdated, contrived","Po Bronson is no Michael Lewis. This book was not the penetrating, insightful look into Silicon Valley that I was expecting, but rather a rehashing of dated stereotypes along with a pretty transparent plot. Bronsons first novel, Bombardiers, was better, probably because he actually saw that industry from the inside, whereas this novel seems to be based on stuff he's picked up at coctail parties. Microserfs gave a much better look into the culture of geeks, though that book also had a weak plot."
3,"Good story, but too simple","Entertaining but ultimately not very satisfying story of Machiavellian power plays in Silicon Valley. The world Bronson paints here is interesting, but just too simplified."
2,Just Didn't Pass Muster,"Silicon Valley is one of the hottest topics right now and as with all new things, writers with a strong facility for language are not going to gravitate towards this subject just yet. Unfortunately, Bronson is not that person. While he has a passable writing style, I still don't get a sense of the society and environment he's trying to describe in this book. And he better watch out, since Michael Lewis is in his territory now and that man can string words together very well. Maybe, I'll wait until Wolfe gets an interest in SV."
5,This Rocks!,"Lion's Mane Mushrooms have quite literally given my brother his life back. They have been used in China for over 5,000 years according to articles we read. He has Parkinson's disease and has had it for approx 15 years. We were searching for anything that could help him, as his medicines weren't working. We came across these, and were sceptical, but we read that they help to rebuild neurons in the brain, so with nothing to lose, about 4 years ago I bought him a couple bottles, and on the first day, he was able to turn off his brain stimulator, and has been able to return to work as a respiratory therapist. He isn't on any drugs for Parkinson's disease now, and is able to function normally. He does continue to take them.Not everyone will have the same results, but we have several family members and friends who have tried them, and all say it has improved their memory at the very least. For the price its worth a try!"
1,Garbage Not Worth Seeing,"This movie is a strange combination of cultures. The action takes place in Spain, but the focus is on the Chinese community of Triads and Tigers (the Chinese Mafia). It poses the question, if you knew who had killed the person you loved most, what would you do about it?A woman who is half Chinese and half Spanish seeks her parents' killer and joins forces with an introverted young Spaniard whose history includes time spent wrongly incarcerated for raping another young woman.The Yellow Fountain is symbolic of where you go at death and meet those who preceded you.The plot is silly and thin. Suspend belief if you watch this. You are asked to believe the two of them (and some cousin) can confront all these high powered killers with one silly revolver.Not worth the effort to watch it."
4,Terrific film,"This is a low key thriller with an emphasis on plot and character development. The story and characters go in unexpected directions, with a heart wrenching conclusion. I'm glad I discovered this film, although I wish I could have seen it theatrically."
4,james Bond,its James Bond what more can be said. Story lines don't really matter. These things are simply entertaing. Sean Connery is James Bond. No one else can touch the role.
3,Cheaper at Target,"You can buy volumes 1& 2 at Target for $8 each. as far as the actual movies go, we'll they are awesome!"
1,Never got it,"I ordered this collection because it had Goldfinger in it, and some colleagues and myself were travleing down to Fl and staying at the Fountaine Bleu Hotel where that movie was made, and we all wanted to see it before we went on this trip. So when the collection came, it was the wrong one- it was collection volume 2 not 1- so I contacted the buyer and after three days of back and forth I finally got permission to send it back- but by then it was too late to have the correct volume reshipped to see it before our trip- so needless to say we still haven't seen the movie!"
5,997,This was a Christmas gift for a family member who requested the Bond series. However Sean Connery is #1 for James Bond.Great movies!
5,For my son,"He loved it, and it was a great value for 3 movies. Sean Connery is a classic to watch. Love a man with a British accent."
3,Flipper is a classic,"I thought Flipper was a good family movie. But, I am partial to dolphins. Good price on 4 movies in one set. Shiloh was very sad and there are parts in the movie that show him being abused by an unhappy adult. We stopped watching the movie because of this. It turned my stomach to see a dog being treated like this. I haven't watched Duma or the Amazing Panda. Our neighbors borrowed this movie set and their 8 year old liked all the movies."
5,Good quality,"Received it quickly (even faster than I had though), it was packaged well and everything works fine.. Great movies for kids"
1,Should have listened to the other reviewer... wrong item sent,"Just got the hat in the mail today and I'm not a happy customer. I got an LSU hat but not the one pictured. And since it's supposed to be a gift for someone who specifically wants the pictured hat, I'll be returning it. I recommend that you take a picture of the hats that you do have."
2,"Try, try again.",My first HTML book. Got me started but.... Poor organization. Had the feel of a superficial rework of a previous book. The examples on CD were particularly disappointing in their simplicity. Possibly OK for someone with no background in programming.
4,Wonder worker!!,"I was skeptical of this until I tried it. We had a regular mole interstate in our front yard. I planted this in the center of the yard and the moles have gone elsewhere. I've order two more to increase the coverage... but it does work wonders!!The only drawback in the design is the way the tip is secured. I pulled the stake out of the ground and the tip was left behind; in order to extract the tip, I had to dig it out (which was a messy proposition... at best)."
4,"Interesting take, too short","This is an interesting take on Chamberlain's impact on professional basketball and, through it, on wider society. It is well written and an interesting read, but I would have welcomed a deeper probe into one or the other of its agendas: Chamberlain the man; Chamberlain the icon; the role of both in civil rights and changing American society. Instead there is a little of each, but all left me wanting a bit more. What's here is good, and I certainly enjoyed it, but more depth would have served the game, the man and the reader better."
1,Superficial and poorly written,"Didn't this exact book come out about a year ago by the same author? Has it just been reprinted by another publisher with a different cover? I found this book really disappointing. The author's bio says she writes for Time Out, which would explain the style-- silly, attempting to be hipper than thou, ultimately poor writing. Who took on this author? Terrible."
2,Detroit 442,I love Deborah Harry. She is a genuinely interesting artist. The author relies too heavily on Deborah's own book Making Tracks. I could have saved my money and just reread Making Tracks.
5,Good bio,"Other reviewers have written about the book, I shall just say this is a decent book, and Blondie fans will like it."
1,Just wait,"I thought I needed the batteries right away to make the spray collar work......YOU DON'T. The collar comes with batteries. So, just wait and see if the collar is a good fit your dog and then get them when the batteries wear out."
2,Didn't last long,Each battery lasted less than a month. Quite inconvenient (and expensive) if you have to keep buying these every other month.
5,"GOOD DEAL, HALF THE PRICE OF PET STORES",GOT TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE BATTERY OF THIS KIND FOUND IN COMMERCIAL PET STORES.
1,Doesn't Work,I tried this one because it was much less expensive than other options. Problem is it doesn't function -- no spray.
2,I'm waiting for post-Episode III edition,"New edition of Guide to Characters is no doubt better than previous but still it has too many defects. Pictures are OK but what really annoys me is completely lack of key SW charactersboth from Prequels and Expanded Universe. It just looks like authors choose accidental heroes and forgot about others. NJO fan will be enraged that there's no real description of Tenel Ka, Zekk, Raynar Thul etc. Ancient Era fan will be enraged that great Nomi Sunrider is barely mentioned. KOTOR fan will quickly notice the absence of Bastila Shan and so on. Besides what sense is publishing (after 6 years) new edition of Character's Guide shortly before the premiere of final Star Wars film - Revenge of the Sith? After 2005 newer edition will be needed anyway and let's hope that this time it will live up to our expectations"
2,Needs to be updated and expanded,"I don't own this book, I just read through it at a local bookstore. I didn't buy it because there was just too much missing. Some major characters from the films and EU are omitted or receive only short (one paragraph) descriptions, while other minor characters get full 1-2 page entries.For example, mad clone Joruus C'Baoth gets one paragraph (nothing on the original Jorus), whereas Boss Nass and Sebulba from Ep I have full entries. Most of the Jedi Council from Eps I and II get one paragraph each in a collective entry, with a few omitted completely. The podrace competitors get about the same coverage as the Jedi Council, if not more. And a personal quibble, I would have liked to have seen an entry on Captain Tarpals. He's at least as important as Sebulba.Surely this will be revised to accommodate Ep III and Tartakovsky Clone Wars updates. Hopefully it will also include many expansions on older characters as well."
5,Mike Sutfin Is the best artist ever,I just want to state for the record that Mike Sutfin above all stood for freedom. Mike's artwork for the essential guide to charachters surpassed all expectations and left me wanting more. I have made a shrine to Mike Sutfin in my home and pray to it every night after the late night shift at Taco Bell. Someday I hope I can meet Mike and tell him how his illustrations changed my life. Onward.
4,Overall A Great Read,"The New Essential Guide To Characters was worth paying almost $40Cdn for. It gives the reader great insight into the character's life and personalities and allows you to get to know that character better. I really liked the pictures, they were colorful and well-drawn. The only drawback I have is the lack of certain charcters. For example, Elan from the New Jedi Order should have been included in this book, she was important to the Vong. Also I noticed that the two charcters shown in Star Wars Insider were not even in the book, except for Poggle the Lesser, who is only mentioned briefly in the appendices."
2,Good .... But not enough characters !!!,"For what it's worth, the hundred or so characters that were covered in the book (Mostly the New Jedi Order),were done in great depth and done nicely. I just thought there would be more second, third and background characters covered from the original George Lucas movie Trilogies. I would have preferred less and more condensed info about the main characters that were in the book and had more short synopsises about the other charecters such as Ree Yees, Weequay, Dorme', Sly Moore, General's Tagge & Rieeken .... etc like the author had in only the last two pages of the book. I was looking for more of a in depth dictionary/encyclopedia of a Star Wars book."
2,Not Good,The book is not clearly organized. Doesn't give enough examples. Their definitions are not clear. I would not recommend this book.
3,Good book - lot's of mistakes,"Most people taking a course like this use Rudin and this is a reasonable supplement but there is a good bit of errata that should be downloaded from the author's site. Pugh's ""Real Mathematical Analysis"" is an alternative."
3,Dense but clear and concise,"It takes a while to get through the explanations of the general topics, but they provide excellent examples in each section of the topics being discussed. The answers in the back of the book, however, are pretty bare boned and not entirely that useful for understanding what you did wrong."
2,Poorly written; to be avioded,"This book has been used as the text for an undergrad analysis class at Stanford for a number of years. It is overly verbose, poorly organized, and terribly written. The language is imprecise, and relies too much on intuition than solid reasoning. Furthermore, the proofs often lack elegance.A much better text is Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis. Concise and eleganty written. The language is precise, and the proofs are often full of beautiful and clever ideas."
2,Not So Hot.,"Unevenly written. Full of typos. Some sections, like the one describing types of matrices, are so incompetently worded as to defy complete comprehension, even with repeated readings. Although some of the coverage of topological material is good, overall the informal explanations don't really do much to supplement the rigorous proofs -- they're just sort of... verbose. Not recommended. (Instead, try ""Yet Another Introduction to Analysis"" by Victor Bryant, as a fine introduction to the subject.)"
1,Disappointed!,"I love the premise of this book but the stories felt very contrived, like the author was trying to tell a story that taught her values. I much preferred her winter solstice book of stories the Return of the Light. Those stories seemed authentic, unlike the stories in Storyteller' Goddess."
5,"Fun, enchanting, and magical!","This book is utterly fabulous! A wonderful selection of Goddess Myth stories from around the world that cross cultural and linguistic barriers.A wonderful gift to give yourself, a child, or any adult. Highly recommended."
4,three degrees of sheer excellence,"This particular female group are one of the best.Their voices are incredible!I only wish they had the original version of the song ""maybe"" on this CD.I have the original ""45"" Roulette recording 5:37(SR-42050)and although in great condition you can still hear the sound behind the music, which only a record makes,It's still a great song."
4,"Pearls have a nice sheen, a little small for me, Perfect for those with smaller ears.","The earrings are pretty, 14K gold cup holders have nice Akoya pearls at the front. Good sheen and lustre and a nice round shape. These are the size of petite peas and were a little small for my taste, as I usually wear very large stud earrings. These look tiny on my ears but were a little too big for my kid. So I may just gift them to someone else. By the way, Amazon's shipping is fast but it was blazing fast this time...I ordered these earrings on Feb 21st evening and they arrived Feb 22nd at 11:30 AM traveling from KY to GA. I was stunned!"
4,Pretty,These are very pretty earrings and nicer than I had expected. They look good with casual or dressy. They are comfortable to wear on my ears. All in all I would order more this size of something else or another color.
3,cute and sweet,"This was a gift, very sweet since I've been wearing plastic pearls for 2 years. They are small (6mm) so if you are looking for more of an impact, go larger. Both of mine are blemished, not badly, but not prestine as in the picture. Nice size/gift for a younger girl. Maybe someday I'll have AAA 8.5's, but for now these are fine."
1,Not happy at all,"I originally purchased a pair of pearls earlier this year off amazon for my girlfriend and they were perfect. Everything she could have asked for and more. Sadly, one of those pearl earrings fell out and she lost it. So I bought her another pair for Christmas. She had them in for the day and now her ear is having an allergic reaction to them. I don't know if it's true 14k gold or not because the first ones didn't do this to her. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UGKP8M/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 were the original ones I purchased in May. The only difference between the two are the color of the gold, size of the pearl, and quality of the pearl. I'm not happy that this caused her ear to get infected."
2,Poor packaging,They came in a paper box and black fake velvet bad. Really not gift worthy. Had to spend more money just to be able to give them to my niece for Christmas.
4,great for the price.,"For $19 dollars I was pleased with these earrings although I honestly don't know much about identifying the quality of pearls. I just received them so don't know if they will hold to the test of time without breaking, and they are somewhat blemished but as other reviewers mentioned you have to look closely to see the blemishes. They are a perfect size for my ears (I have thick earlobes, they might seem big if your earlobes are tiny) and they have a pretty shine to them. Do note that these are not pink as they appear in the picture. I think it is the lighting of the camera that seems to give them the pink hue. They are actually white."
3,"nice, and pretty, but back holder is too loose.","The pice is pretty nice. The earing itself is very pretty, the color is a little bit too yellow for me compare to the real picture. after 1 week wearing them, I lost one already. BTW, maybe it has something to do with that I love to wear turtleneck sweater. I feel so bad after I lost one."
1,Dangerous studs,The first time i wore these the pearl fell off and the shaft cut my ear! Only give these as a gift to someone you don't like!
2,The pearls do not match each other,These pearls do not match each other in size and color.The box and bag that contain the earrings look cheap.
3,"Okay, maybe even decent for the price","I bought these earrings for a great price, so I wasn't expecting top quality, but the packaging left quite a bit to be desired. I was giving them to my daughter for a birthday gift, and had to reuse an old earring box I had to wrap them. The cheap drawstring bag and the loose sheets of white foam make the earrings look extremely cheap. That being said, I was relatively pleased with the actual earrings themselves. If you're looking for a pair of cheap pearl earrings, these are a good buy."
2,So-so Pearl Studs...,"Ordered 3 pair of these earrings, to use as gifts. Out of a total of 6 earrings, 2 were not glued completely to the posts, at danger of falling off posts, but these pearls were good, very minor blemishes, almost flawless. Two were very severly blemished on the front, most visible part of the pearls, with many dents and bumps. Two had dark spots, swirls and blemishes, again on the front of the pearls. None were near as pristine as in the picture. The blemishes/dark areas were visible from across the room. The good thing is that the posts and backs were solid and secure. Also, Akoya pearls have a nice, lustrous sheen. Returned for refund, as I would not want to give these as a gift to someone I liked. With Amazon jewelry, it is real hit or miss. I'm glad they are good about returns. Thanks Amazon! Very disappointed."
5,Pearl earrings,"These earrings are beautiful. If you are looking for a simple pair of stud earrings, these are perfect."
2,Pretty But Not Well Made,"I was gifted these earrings for Christmas 2007. They were very beautiful and I wore them everyday. After 5 months one of the pearls broke off the post. They are nice looking, however they don't seem to be well made."
2,Beware! Much smaller than the size advertised,"These were ordered as a gift, so I spent some time deciding which size would look the best on the recipient. I ordered the 6.5-7.0 mm, but what I received was (according to Amazon's own scale and then measured with a metric ruler) was 5.5-6.0 mm. Two sizes smaller than what I ordered! While the pearls were very nice, I was disappointed with the small size and am returning the earrings."
5,very nice+++,I never got to see them sent them to my sister for her birthday 22. Well she loved them my mom said she has them on a lot. She said they are classy!!
2,not as in picture!,"Don't buy!! Looks pink in picture and bigger, turns out they were small and white, not what I wanted or expected at all."
2,Hornby comparisons? Please.,"Throughout this novel, it felt like this author was trying to ""do"" Nick Hornby. Come on - that's a recipe for disaster and very presumptuous.So much of the conversations between the men seemed unrealistic. Something tells me that most guys just do not talk about sex and love to that degree with each other.The ending was long-awaited and not very satisfactory. The most colorful, believable, likeable characters in the story were the minor ones - Sheila and Kostas.All in all, this book was just okay - not really recommended on any level."
2,"Nice Look, Bad Carafe, Hard To Read LED","When opening the coffee maker, I realized that part of the carafe handle is missing, after taking everything out of the box; I saw the piece of plastic on the bottom. The handle of this carafe is made up of 2 plastic pieces that are supposed to snap together, however they don&#65533;t, the outer handle keeps coming loose, so I had to resort to my super glue and glued the sucker in permanently. I have used this machine for about 5 times now and noticed that if you do not pour the water in VERY SLOWLY, it will overflow. Using Starbucks Whole Bean House Blend coffee, I noticed that the coffee tastes like it does in any other drip coffee maker and not close to the coffee served at my local Starbucks. The last disappointment about this coffee maker is that the LED clock/timer is extremely hard to read, you literally have to stare down at it to see it, even then, if you don&#65533;t have bright light nearby, you will have a hard time determine the time."
5,"Rich, full-bodied cup of brew","Rich, full-bodied, non-acidic cup of brew. Couldn't order it from the regular supplier and for a few weeks had to sample other brands in all price ranges, but none of them could stand up to Millstone's Colombian Supremo. The aroma when you open the bag will make you salivate while you wait for it to brew. A family favorite!"
4,Not a Musicologist,"If you love the piano, as I do, then this is a great CD to listen to. Beautiful music, sound is less than perfect, but performance top notch!"
1,"Noisy Rotors, Poor Customer Support","These rotors are super loud and product a ""buzzing"" sound when drive over 15mph. The buzzing sound goes away when the brakes are applied, but then you get a ""whirring"" sound. I only expect the whirring sound as stated in the product description, but not a buzzing sound when the brakes are not in use.It is so annoying that other drivers give me weird looks. I cannot recommend these rotors.Beware of the reviews on EBC's website! The review form is an e-mail form and they only post the 5-star reviews. That's why you won't see other reviews there."
1,Im very disappointed!!!,"Im very disappointed,,, because i put the EBC Rotors in my car and i used it only 20,000 miles and the disks were bent!!! i wrote a message to them and they didnt give me any answer!!! i had to change the rotors to my old ones!!!!"
5,FANTASTIC,I heard this CD at a friend's house recently and had to have it. Every track is great. At least 6 of my friends have bought it since they heard my copy.
4,Effortless Talent,"Smooth, smooth, smooth. I wanted a few songs from the CD. But, when I heard all of the songs, they were all lovely. Tyrell has a unique, timeless voice."
5,Steve Tyrell's Standard CD,"This CD is ""fantastic""! I love every song which is unusually. It is excellent for tap dancing which is how I use it."
4,Excellent CD.,"This is a very nice interpretation of several jazz classics. Steve Tyrell was featured in the ""Father of the Bride"" movies, and his voice and music is pure pleasure."
5,"""A New Standard"" for relaxation and entertainment.","I too, was in a Barnes & Nobles outlet in NYC when I heard this CD playing over the store's PA system. I went to the music section to find out who the artist was, and I've been playing this Steve Tyrell CD on a regular basis ever since. He's laid back, natural, and just plain fun to listen to. I'm hoping there are more CD's to follow. I'll be a buyer."
3,the New Standard,Great sounds. Would like to get for my mother but she's 81 and doesn't have a CD player. Only plays LP's and tapes. Too bad not available on tape.
5,What A Find!,I have to admit I had never heard of Steve Tyrell until I heard this CD playing one night in a music store. I bought it immediately and have loved it ever since!
5,"No need for a ""skip"" button here.","Steve Tyrell's blend of mild jazz classics is sure to please. My wife gave it to me for Christmas, and there isn't a single song I skipped. This is the kind of disk you put on and press the repeat button, then sit back and enjoy. No loud, annoying, experimental or elevator jazz sound here, just pure entertainment from a singer whose grasp of style and appreciation for a certain familiarity is refreshing. Tyrell doesn't distance himself from the classics, but rather wraps himself in them and clearly enjoys what he is doing. Another thing, the orshestration is superb. This is not one of the disks you put on and wait for the dreaded shrill. You won't find it here. I strongly recommend it for those people like me who throw out far too many disks that promise more than they deliver. Steve Tyrell's ""A new Standard"" is mild jazz, as it was meant to be: solid, confident and soulfull. A great buy!"
5,Romance Is Alive!,"Between the sexiness of the voice and the lyrics in the songs, I am feeling inspired to believe in good old fashioned love and romance.... The kind that gets ahold of you heart, mind and soul. This is music to fall in love with and to, I have played it for my boyfriend and others and can't find a single person who dosn't find it addictive and inspiring. It make me smile and sing. Dance and feel playfully happy. There should be another name for a cd like this...it's more than a cd, it's sex therapy!"
2,Beyond Overrated,"He sings out of tune, for God's sake - just hear him butcher ""I'll Be Seeing You"" - he's flat in several spots. And he has no ability to interpret a lyric whatsoever. Two stars for the tasteful backing. Did all the Sinatra and Tony Bennett and Mel Torme CDs vanish from the face of the earth? They didn't? Then why do we need this second-rate poseur?"
5,Tyrell's Album Hits Homerun!,"It is a rare treat when a singer comes along that has such a distinctive voice as does Steve Tyrell. His voice is rich, warm, and has just the right mix of raspiness and soul to make you feel comfortable with him right away. It has the same quality possessed by singers like Louie Prima and Ray Charles.The selection of songs is sublime and the assemblage of musicians is so perfect this album would be a 'must-buy' even without Tyrell's wonderful vocals."
5,We Want More!,"I was hooked when I heard Steve sing ""The Way You Look Tonight"" in Father of the Bride and bought this CD without hearing any other cuts. This is a great CD that I still play daily. Everything works here - the voice and arrangements. You won't be dissapointed!"
1,Not even close to the Jess I knew,"Sometimes it's better to let things lie. This finale was a mistake and an insult to what was a great teen series. The previous 1-800 books were quick, humorous, and eventful. This book panders to the broadest audience, layering on the romance thickly instead of focusing on an actual plot. What made the first four books great is that their author did not allow the romance between Jess and Rob to detract from the main plot. This book decided to go the Mia Thermopolis route and make Jess into a whiny, brainless girl who moans a lot about whether her boyfriend likes her or LIKE LIKES her.I recommend reading the first four and pretending this book doesn't exist. It was so boring, so trivial, I kept having to force myself to reread passages because I would find my mind wandering. The end is corny beyond belief and turned two of my favorite characters in teen literature into characters of a Made-for-TV Lifetime movie."
2,Amazing event. Unamazing author.,"Ms. Oldenbourg sets out in what I considered a catholic-apologist style, but one clearly leaning away from the 13th century Church. Her tale of the generations of Counts of Toulouse and thier various enemies: the Church, characterized by Pope Innocent III and Simon de Montfort, a brilliant tactician, and the French King (and later Regency) is less than gripping. The events should be read and discussed, for they are fascinating. But Ms. Oldenbourg throws out opinion after opinion, giving a full page of ""oh, woe!"" after a particularly gruesome murder by a bishop.If you are a schoolteacher, you will bore your students to death. If you absolutely love history, you can get through this book and learn a great deal; the sections describing the Catharist heresy (chapter 4?) and the beginnings of the Inquisition (chapter 11) were definitely informative.If you have to, read this book. If not, read something else."
3,power per USB slot,Basically a good product I would have like more juice per channel to power USB 2.5 inch external drives for lap tops.
2,Worked Fine For About A month,This hub worked fine and was easy to set up. Some how after about a month it quit working at all. Anything connected to it would not function. The only things I had attached to it was two Printers and a 2gb thumb drive. I just installed the replacement hub (different brand) so we will see if this goes south after about a month.
3,"Ordered it, got it","Nice unit. However, like most USB hubs, ports are too close together or low to desktop for some items to share adjacent ports."
5,Works Just Fine,"This USB hub replaces a USB 1.0 4-port hub on my desk. It was a no brainer to install, and it takes up little space on my small desk."
4,Effortless,"No problems. It does require plugging into an AC outlet, and it does take up a fair amount of space, but worked seamlessly."
5,Good Product,I've had this product about 6 wks and seems to be working fine. No complaints yet. Just plugged it in and went to work on the computer.
5,No fuss,"I use this at home on my netbook, which only has 3 usb ports. I didn't want to take up 2 of the ports with a usb powered hub, so I chose this one which is powered by an outlet. I just plugged everything in--printer, mouse, keyboard, and storage drive--and everything started working fine, no fuss."
3,It didn't work for me.,"I had to send it back because for me it didn't work. I thought it was my machine, but once I took the hub off I got rid of my problems."
4,It is a USB 2.0 hub...,"I cant give this a 5 star, because there is nothing that really distinguishes it from others.The thing that stinks about ALL USB 2.0 hubs (that I know of) is that once you connect a USB 1.1 device, all the 2.0 devices on the hub slow down to the 1.1 speed.Setup was easy, I like the basic box look, can get a little messy with 7 USB wires!"
2,Sucks for my use,"I wanted to use this as a USB charging station. It has enough power, but it only provides power to the output ports when it is connected to a PC, but I only have laptops and don't keep the laptop near where we charge everything. This flaw makes it suck, but aside from that it seems ok."
4,Works as Advertised,"I hate the fact that the computer industry lies about just about everything. To call this a 7 port switch is a really stretching the truth. Since I have to plug one end into a free USB port on my computer and the other into the 7 port USB block, I really get 6 ports.Otherwise it's a powered hub that does what a hub is suppose to do - give me more free USB ports."
2,Didn't work. Returned.,"I believe was bad luck. I have another of the same kind that works, which made me order the same type. I still need a USB hub..."
1,Piece of garbage...avoid!,"Please take my advice and avoid this hunk of plastic garbage. Had constant iPod connectivity problems, I even did an unnecessary restore on the iPod since I thought it was causing the sync problems; no, it was the D-Link hub. Data transfers painfully slow, lucky to get 2.0 mbps (yes, that's 2mb, not 200mb)would lose external drive connection during data transfers, horrible. Replaced it with thisPlugable USB 2.0 10 Port Hub (with Power Adapter)which so far is running beautifully, none of the issues I had before with this shoddy D-Link product, a company I will avoid forever...I was so angry with this device it prompted me to write my first Amazon review!"
1,junkij,"it glitches the chipset when its taxed on start up, fully taxed hub system will fail to start, might be funky bluescreen or just halt at bios, better off with another usb controller"
2,Petered out,"Suddenly stopped working--lights wouldn't light up, and my devices wouldn't connect. Not buying this one again."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"Plug the unit into your computer. Plug your iPad into the ""fast charging"" ports. iPad reports ""Not Charging.""This product DOES NOT work as advertised."
1,WARNING - Only Hi-Amp Charge when not hooked to Computer,"Really liked the idea of this product, just got it, and when you plug an ipad into it - it does not charge the iPad! It only does the ""Hi-Amp charge when the USB hub IS NOT plugged into a computer. Really it's pretty close to false advertising.So my search for a USB hub that does Hi-Amp charging AND works as a hub continues."
4,Running smoothly since 2010,"I bought this device to extend the amount of available USB ports on my MacBook Pro. I knew going into this that I wanted a powered USB hub because of the devices I'd be connecting and their power draw, and this one received the highest marks at the time. I'm pleased to say it's still running smoothly with one caveat - the power isn't sufficient to charge my tablet. This will be a problem for most USB hubs, powered or not, so I'm not going to dock more than one star. One other thing I thought they could have done better is with the aesthetics - it's classic D-Link which is classically bad."
5,D-Link DUB-H7 Review,Works as advertised - Everything was supplied and installed on Windows Vista 64 Bit Machine with no problems.
3,Good for USB 2.0; Bad for USB 1.1,"Pro: With the rebate, this is an excellent price for a USB 2.0 hub. I've had up to 6 USB 2.0 devices connected to it without any problems. I've had it for almost a year.Con: Does not work well with USB 1.1 devices. I connected a USB 1.1 scanner to the hub. For about one out of every 6 scans, the scanner will lock up and I have to reboot the PC to restart it. If I connect the USB 1.1 scanner through a USB 1.1 hub, then it locks up about once every 25 scans. In any case, ALL the USB devices slow down significantly when the USB 1.1 scanner was connected - It didn't matter whether or not I was using the scanner. My USB 1.1 printer also causes the slowdown. My solution was to wire my USB 1.1 hub directly to my PC and have it only drive my USB 1.1 devices.As a side note, disconnecting the USB 1.1 device while the PC was on did not improve the speed. The USB 1.1 device had to be disconnected before the PC is powered on to get maximum speed."
5,Top Notch hub for all those USB connections!,"I bought this because I was running out of USB ports on my computer tower. Plus I was constantly plugging and unplugging cords for my MP3 player and portable 2.5"" USB SATA drive.Now I just have all the cords plugged in to this unit, it has its own external power supply by the way, and I don't have to keep struggling the tower."
4,Very good,Very nice hub. Doesn't slip on my desk. Green LED indicators; 7 extension ports. Compact and sleek. All in all a very nice industrial design. With the price to match it. Installed well on my Windows XP. No issues with higher power consuming USB peripherals such as portable HDs. My only problem with the device is that it is 100-120V; 50-60Hz. I wish it was 100-240V instead.
2,"Worked Great, for a while....","I got this product in February of 2012. It worked great, until it decided to start hanging and resetting. I would be using a program stored on the drive, and poof, it would just stop working. It would be out less than a few seconds, but long enough to make anything plugged into it stop working. This included not only my 2 external drives, but also my wireless headset and my Bluetooth dongle.This is not just annoying, it shouldn't be happening to a hub that is only 8 months old.I will never buy another DLink item in my life. Now, as I look @ the photo of this hub, it isn't even the one I was shipped. It is the one I ordered, but the one i received isD-Link DUB-H7 USB 2.0 7-port Hubthis one."
5,It works,Plug in and go. Has the external power supply just incase you need that extra juice for your USB device.
1,Won't work with Tosh laptop..,"Bought a $500 Dell laptop from BB last month. Hooked up this H7. Connected 2 IPODs, Logitech wireless mouse,Garmin GPS, all work fine. (Ipods won't charge unless computer is on).Bought a $500 Tosh from BB last week Hooked up this H7. Same items worked intially, then not at all. Thought I got a bad 1, so I connected another I had planned to give to my mom, same story. Returning the Tosh laptop for a dell."
1,Below atrocious,"To this day - October 24, 2008 - the D-Link hubs (including this one) will revert all the ports of itself to USB 1.1 when even only a single USB 1.1 device is plugged into it. So your USB 2 speed is gone.It will not allow itself to be daisy-chained to an exact same model with any stability.The customer ""service"" department at D-Link is beneath contempt.Save your money and your aggravation."
1,It sucks,This product is terrible. The first one died within 3 weeks of arriving. The second was DOA. Don't waste your money.
1,Tasty Awesomeness In A Small Package!,"The rating stars didn't work in this rating. I give it 5 stars!!!!!!!!This little beauty is a work horse. I have a Mac and didn't need the supplied drivers for operation, but my husband used it on his PC and everything installed and worked PERFECTLY. It's fast, inobtrusive and is a lot of ""bang for the buck"". I'd highly recommend this product. For the price, it's priceless!"
2,Using a USB 1.1 port will affect device performance.,"Per the official product specification on D-Link's own website:""Using a USB 1.1 port will affect device performance.""So if you plug in a USB 1.1 device to this port, all your USB 2.0 devices will drop to the lower USB 1.1 speed."
1,won't power external hard drives,"this thing will work fine with flash/thumb drives, but I have 2 different kinds of hard drives (iomega, WD in a generic case), and it refuses to power either of them. Dreaded ""supply exceeded"" in both cases.WTF is the use of having a *powered* USB hub, if it doesn't provide enough juice to do the job?I got this thing free from a former job, am throwing it away. Not worth the price, even if it's free."
1,High hopes big problem,"I had hoped this would help me add all the USB2 items I have accumulated. Sometimes it recognizes peripherals and other times not. Just gave up and threw it in the trash, went back to my $10 USB1 hub for now."
1,Sent back 1 problem still here!,The problem is every time I restart the computer 2-3 items are not reconized by hub. Sometimes the Mouse or Keyboard or UPC backup. I have to unplug and replug each one to make work. What a pain.
2,Fast Charging will not work when attached to an Apple computer or an iphone!!!,"What they don't tell you is that you cannot use the main selling point--fast charge high current mode-- with an apple computer. Same with Linux. it only supports windows computers for that mode, On windows computers you have to install a driver that looks for ipads and only then activates high power mode. Thus effectively it is worthless except for ipads (not iphones) on widows computers. The only way you can use the high power mode is to detach it from the computer so that it's not a USB hub anymore, then the hogh power mode turns on. That is it's just an expensive wall charger not a USB hub, All this is documented in the instructions that come with it, but not in the marketing literature. They get 1 star for being deceptive.Update: there is now fine print at the bottom of the ad that says you have to turn off the computer to use fast charging mode. why is this big deal shoved into the fine print???"
3,"It works, but...","Bought this product primarily to be able to run mutiple external hard drives along with other hardware. Hooked HD's in and started transferring data. Incredibly slow. If you are thinking of purchasing for same reasons, don't. If you just want to hook up other less demanding hardware, it will work just fine."
5,D-Link DUB-H7 High Speed USB 2.0 7-Port Hub,"Works great with my Mac!I'm currently using 4 of the 7 ports and all function properly (printer, Ipod, external hard drive and another DVD/CD drive). Easy to install: plug in the device to one of your USB ports on the computer and the other in into the outlet or power strip. That's all that's required for a Mac! Then plug in your gadgets and you're all set.It's a relatively inexpensive way to increase your USB ports."
1,DO NOT USE WITH YOUR LEXAR MEDIA JUMPDRIVE,"I just purchased this item and it destroyed all the data on my LEXAR 2.0 256MB USB JumpDrive. Further more, D-Link was completely unhelpful, with customer serve reps who did not even understand what a USB-Hub (even though I gave them a part number) and kept asking me questions which referred to an Ethernet hub not a USB hub.I lost all of my dissertation data, let's just hope Lexar has better customer service than D-Link."
3,"Looks nice, doesn't fit the bill","Bought this hub because I work off my laptop. I was tired of having to plug my phone, iPad, mouse dongle and usb backup drive into my Mac every morning when I came to work. I wanted to just have one box with everything plugged into it and have a single cable to my computer. Then my iPhone and iPad would stay charged and my mouse would work without worrying about losing that little dongle.Doesn't charge iPads. -1 star. Except when the USB cable is unplugged from the back of the hub. -1 star. Dumbest thing I've ever seen. It's one thing to not charge at all. It's another to only charge sometimes. Why advertise fast charging ports for ""tablet computers"" if you can't use it as a hub and a charger at the same time! And I'm not exceeding the maximum amperage because the iPad is the only thing plugged in."
2,Powered USB hub,Very disappointed - I should have gone to the D-Link site to get detailed information. I purchased the unit hoping to both power and expand a Raspberry Pi - turns out that the 2 charging ports only supply 1.2A when the hub function is NOT used.
2,2 items 1 sku,"The hub itself works great.The problem arises from specifically picking the hub pictured because it matched where I needed to put it, but instead receiving the other hub listed on Amazon as the Dlink H4. It's hard to tell if the black one that looks like Apple TV is an older model with the same sku or a completely different model but either way the one pictured on my order is not the one that arrived. So buyer beware if you are looking for the black hub, you may receive the grey rectangle unit with 4 ports lined in the front."
5,This unit was my peripherals' salvation!,"I was wrestling for weeks with issues of simultaneous, effective activation of USB-connecting printer, headset, video cam, copier, etc.This unit cleared up all such glitches, immediately. Would be terrific if DOUBLE the price. About 20 bucks after the rebate is simple outstanding. As to the unit being ""flimsy"" and/or ""tippy:"" a simple loop of Gorilla-brand tape placed underneath renders the hub strong and stable, no matter how many cables are attached."
4,"What can I say, it's a USB Hub","Aren't a lot of expectations here, but it does the job, it's simple, clean and works with my Mac Book Pro without issues. Makes it easier for me to unplug this one USB to take the laptop on the road than the previous configuration. I'm happy with it, if you need one, get it."
1,Poorly Built,Had the unit 2 months before one port died. three months later the unit started producing power irregularities which meant the computer kept rejecting the ports. Two strikes but I'm out. Have to buy another unit. No more D-Link for me. I've had other gear from this company and find that they don't build stuff for the long-haul.
2,Very disappointed,"Purchased this for my 4 yr. old Dell laptop. The hub is not always recognized by my computer when I plug it into one of my two my USB slots. Also, contrary to some reviews, the included powercord IS NOT 220V capable. I'm in Europe and therefore can't plug it into an outlet without a converter."
5,D-Link QuickMedia DUB-H7 7-Port USB 2.0 Hub,"In a sturdy metal case that is typical of D-Link products the DUB-H7 7 port hub is a very sturdy, quality product. It has green lights on the front of the hub to tell you that is is working properly, but unlike the cheap plastic hub it replaced, the lights are not too bright or intrusive. Cables fit securely into the ports. Of course the hub works flawlessly."
2,DOES NOT CHARGE IPAD !,"It may trickle charge (very slowly), but it does not charge iPad as claimed. 1.2a is not enough to charge the iPad. Supposedly there is a software from D-link that makes this possible, but only for PC users. I don't know how software can change 1.2a to the necessary 2.0a. That sounds wrong.False advertising not appreciated."
2,Fast Charge Mode Sucks,"The whole reason I bought this USB hub was because it said it could charge an iPad while connected to the computer. NOT! It is an either/or thing. You have to disconnect it from the computer before it will enter ""Fast Charge Mode"", then it will charge the iPad, but you can't do both at the same time! LAME. Oh, if you have a PC, they have some utility that claims it will allow simultaneous connect and charge, but it only runs on a PC. I am really disappointed with how D-Link describes this product."
3,Does not work well with Lion,"A word of warning: This may work well with PCs but perhaps not with Macs running the latest version of Lion. It was OK with OS X 10.4 but it caused kernel panics in Lion (10.7). I had to buy a new hub that was compatible, a Tripp Lite U222-010-R USB 2.0 Hi-Speed Hub from Amazon. There is some blame attributable to the Apple software upgrade."
4,DUB-H7 7-port USB hub,"Works quite well, although not powerful enough to run my 3.5"" drive. All other peripherals work with it just fine."
5,D-Link Hub What you'd expect,"This hub is small, well constructed and works perfectly out of the box. Simple and effective."
4,Works very well with Mac Os X,Plugged it into an iMac and everything works seamlessly. Have not had any problems so far.
1,Does not work,"I just bought this to replace a 7-port Belkin USB hub which I've used for about four years with my MacBook Pro. That hub could generally power all my peripherals at once, within reason. It recently started completely flaking out, so I bought this as a replacement. Upon connecting, this piece of junk can't detect my keyboard, my Wacom tablet or any of my other peripherals. It doesn't have enough power to connect even a single Das Keyboard. I'm not even going to fiddle with this; it's just as bad as the old hub it's supposed to replace. I'm returning it immediately and buying a different hub. This is a big inconvenience for me. Now I have to find another hub that actually works, and in the meantime I have to settle for the two measly ports on my computer."
1,no continuity after computer sleep,I bought this item on amazon. After the computer sleeps - my devices which are plugged into this hub do not register - ie mouse & keyboard. If i unplug/replug the cables they will *usually* come back. If i un/replug the hub-to-computer line i may lose one device and get back another. Its a real mess and renders the thing an irritating little box. I had a similar problem 2 years ago with the same brand and i suppose im a glutton for punishment - i figured the problem could not possibly have migrated to a newer version of this device. Its crap - avoid!
4,USB Hub,"D-Link DUB-H7 High Speed USB 2.0 7-Port HubGreat product, customer service, and prompt shipping."
4,Works as Advertised,"I hate the fact that the computer industry lies about just about everything. To call this a 4 port switch is a really stretching the truth. Since I have to plug one end into a free USB port on my computer and the other into the 4 port USB block, I really get 3 ports.Otherwise it's a powered hub that does what a hub is suppose to do - give me more free USB ports."
1,The product is okay??? But. . .,"Update: I wanted to be fair to the D-link HUB and say it is really a great little device. It deserves at least a 4 and maybe even a 5? I spoke in anger and should have been more patient. ANTonline did a fair job and is not responsible once the item leaves their warehouses. The item is really a simple plug and play with a no brain`r to operate.Forgive my anger and buy one of these if you need it because it works great. . . P.CassidyI ordered this on the 18th from a seller less than 600miles from my home. This should have arrived on Monday the 21st it is now the 23rd and it still has not arrived. If one pays for a timely delivery it should be provided. I honestly think the hub will be a fine item and just wanted to warn everyone to avoid purchasing from ""Slow as Ants online"" if you expect a timely delivery to your household."
1,Don't Buy....,Terrible product...customer service rude and unhelpful...waste of money...THIS COMPANY MAKES BAD PRODUCTS ...TOTAL RIIIIIIIIIIIIP OFF!
1,didn't order dlink and canceled order for audio? unit,i caanceled my order due to untimely delivery.
1,Try a USB 2.0 Hub from Targus Instead,"Tends to run hot. Frequently freezes. My two Targus mini-hubs (one an earlier 1.1, the other a 2.0 -- bought after the demise of the two D-Links) are ultra-compact, don't seem to want a power supply,& have worked very well on four PCs laptop & desktop, 98SE, XP Home, and XP Pro. Frankly, I'm amazed. Usually, anytime I add ANYthing to the home PCs, I get catcalls and complaints from the peanut gallery -- despite my very professional demeanor. Neither Targus was even noticed. Okay, the, to me, irritating, but otherwise real cool blue lights on the first, got oohs & aahs. No complaints, though."
4,hurray,"it works, there are a lot of ports, but it has a cheap construction. Eh, not everything can be made of platinum. Wish it would have been cheaper, but it is already cheaper than when I bought it."
1,dont buy,"i became so frustrated with this thing losing connection and the constant beeping of my computer i threw it away. get the cyberpower 7 port that one has never failed.CyberPower CPH720P USB Hub, 7-Port, USB 2.0, 480Mbps, 1.1/2.0 Compatible, PC/MAC PlugNPlay - Lifetime Warranty"
2,Great brand. Not so great hub.,"D-Link makes great products. Unfortunately this is not one of them. Or maybe I'm just the unlucky consumer whose external hard drive, ipod, web cam, and usb tv tuner are not compatible with this hub.This hub is great for connecting my mouse and my printer (which is off most of the time). But it drops connections with my external hard drive (don't even ask about booting up with my external plugged into this thing) it will not allow my ipod to connect, nor will it get a signal with my usb tv tuner, or allow any sort of normal frame rate on my webcam (i'm getting about 1 frame every 5 seconds).Maybe I got a defective unit. I'm definately returning this."
1,Didn't work properly - had to return.,"This product was terrible. The ports kept going out, which is frustrating when trying to print. I eventually complained to the seller and they told me to use the AC plug. Still didn't work, so returned it. You get what you pay for, I suppose!"
4,So far so good,"I am really tired of USB hubs shoting or burning out. I purchased two of these because the user reviews were very positive. Out of the box the build seems more sturdy than the ones I've seen short out (Staples and Best Buy offer under these types of hubs under their own label and have a lifespan measured in minutes!).One of the two purchased manages a bank consiusting of a scanner, postal scale, a postage thermal printer, and several external hard drives. The other manages a bank of 4 printers, and some duplication equipment. So far both are operating fine without any indication of failure."
2,What a misleading description,The fast charging ports cannot be used when computer is connected to the hub. So no iPad charging and synchronizing at the same time. Why would someone design such a hub?
2,It only worked in certain situation for me.,I returned this product mainly because it kept on losing connections to all the devices connected to it when my PC is in energy saving mode. I have to reconnect couple of time a day which was not convenient.
2,Not so hot.,"This thing does its job sometimes, but for laptop users that are constantly disconnecting, reconnecting, going into sleep mode, etc, it often gets confused. I found myself constantly unplugging and plugging devices back in to get them to be recognized, because this hub seemed to lose the connection. I now have a small travel usb hub that doesn't even require a power adapter and works perfect! Maybe I'll use this hub for a desktop or something that doesn't need to be constantly disconnected and re-connected."
3,USB mouse periodically freezes,"I have a laptop without PS/2 ports so I needed a USB hub to connect an external keyboard (MS Natural Elite) and mouse (MS Optical Wheel Mouse). Unfortunately, the mouse freezes for a complete second during high CPU times (about every ~1-10 minutes). I bought a much smaller SIIG USB 2.0 mobile/notebook hub (not the ""mini hub"" one which is bigger), and it doesn't have these problems. With the SIIG, you don't have to use the AC adapter, unlike the D-Link."
2,disappointing...,"This is my first usb hub.One of my devices, a linksys usb200ha, works fine when plugged directly into a usb port on the pc. When I attempt to plug this device into the dlink hub the port ""overloads"" and shuts itself off. My other devices seem to work ok with the hub: a usb powered 100mb zip drive, and a LiteOn DVD/CDRW."
1,Compatibility Issues Galore,"I previously attempted to use this device with my Mac Pro. I run the machine with Windows XP and Mac OS X Tiger.With Tiger, the machine refuses to sleep when the hub is plugged into my Aluminum Cinema Display. Simply unplug the D-Link hub, and the machine happily goes to sleep.With Windows XP, the machine does not recognize my Microsoft Ergo Keyboard 4000 until I disconnect the keyboard from the hub, then reconnect it. Ironically, the keyboard works fine under OS X when connected to the D-Link Hub.I guess I got what I paid for. A piece of junk 7 port hub for under $30. I have reverted back to using my 2x4 Port ""hockey puck"" style Belkin USB 2.0 Hubs. No problems with those."
1,Nothing but problems,"I bought this item specifically because it was Mac Compatible and capable of charging the iPad and iPhone...or so I thought. I have had nothing but issues with it since I got it. Sometimes my iPhone charges, but not consistently. Today I got the error message ""Charging not supported with this device"" even though I had been charging the phone the last couple of weeks the same way. My iPad doesn't give me an error message, but it just won't charge. Yes, I am even using the special slots created for Mac devices. Very disappointed."
3,Nice connectivity. Poor charging ability.,"I ordered this hub to give much needed connectivity to my Mac mini, while leaving 30-pin and Lightning iPhone cables plugged in all the time. But, the ""high-power"" ports will not charge the original iPad. Maybe I need to unplug all the other USB ports? Don't know, not trying it.Nice connectivity. Poor charging ability."
4,Two features worth noting,"I think the other reviews largely get it right. Two things I haven't seen in them, however: first, the plug on the power cord is in the shape of a wide black monolith, so, like bulky a/c adaptors... Second, the included documentation says that the hub will revert to a USB 1.1 hub FOR ALL DEVICES if you have any USB 1 device connected. It says that to get USB 2.0 throughput, you must disconnect all USB 1.0 or 1.1 devices from the hub first. That's worth knowing.Finally, if you buy the hub, I suggest going to Windows Update and downloading the optional USB 2.0 fix for WinXP SP 1."
2,2 high speed charging port issue,"In order to get full charging power from the high speed charging ports, the DUB-H7 must be disconnected from your pc disabling all of the 5 non-high speed charging ports. With the DUB-H7 connected to the pc, the 2 charging ports operate but at a lower charge rate. Apparently there is a D-Link app available app that resolves this issue for an iPad or iPhone but not for a Nexus android device."
4,less clutter,"there is less clutter on my desk. cords are not all over. smaller than expected, which is good. works beautifully. delivery outstanding."
1,Worse than useless,"I own one of these. Every day or two, it will flake out, requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in in order for the computer to recognize any connected devices. Furthermore, whenever I try to use my USB scanner, the scanning application crashes in mid-scan. None of this happens if I use my old Linksys 4-port hub. Guess this goes into my drawer of broken electronics. I'm buying a Linksys 7-port hub instead."
1,Doesn't work for me,"I bought four of these, all at the same time and all from the same vendor. Perhaps it's a lot problem, but they are all junk. They are constantly dropping connection and I have to unplug the hub and plug it back in to get the devices that are plugged into it to be recognized again. I've used these hubs on XP, XP 64-bit, and Vista and they drop connections on all. These are all different brands of computers and in two different physical locations so I know it's not my computer. Cables To Go 7 Port USB 2.0 Hub that I replaced them with has had no problems with dropping connections."
2,Problems while using with iMac,"I have had this 7-port hub for a couple of months now and am using it with an iMac. Its performance has been erratic. I had all my peripherals plugged to it - printer, camera, keyboard-mouse and my iPod sync cable.It worked fine for a couple of weeks. Then the keyboard-mouse started failing to detect on startup. Unplugging and replugging would solve the problem but it was not worth the trouble for every time. Then the iPod refused to sync through the hub. So now I am back to using the ports on my computer.So I'm not happy with the product. Either I got a bad piece or Mac users should stay away from this USB Hub.I'm unhappy because I was a believer in D-Link. I have a D-Link wireless router that has been working flawlessly for over 2 years now.Follow Up: I contacted customer service and they sent me a replacement that has been working well since..... so I guess I just had a bad part.. nothing to do with computer compatibility."
1,Couldn't get ports 4 and 7 to work properly for USB Mass Storage,Either I got a dud or the product is poorly designed. I couldn't get ports 4 and 7 to work properly for USB Mass Storage devices. Ended up returning this and adding PCI-USB interfaces to my desktop instead.
1,This hub is not reliable,"I bought this hub so that I could easily connect and disconnect my various USB devices when coming and going with my laptop. Unfortunately, every time I come back to my desk and plug in the hub, there are always a few, seemingly random, devices that are not recognized. I have to unplug the device from the hub, wait a couple seconds, and then plug it back in again. What a pain! Unfortunately there aren't many hubs on the market with so many ports, and I don't know if any of the others perform better."
2,good while it lasts,"I started using this hub in January, 2009. It installed fine on a Vista system and handled the transition to Windows7 well. Then it died abruptly in May of 2010. I ordered a replacement, which died with no warning October, 2010. Both hubs worked so well as to be invisible right up to the moment they gave up. I think I'll try another brand this time."
2,Stopped working after 6 months of constant use,"It was good while it lasted - really good, in fact. All 7 hubs were in use, with no issue about speed. Then one day, my computer (windows 7 desktop) didn't recognize my scanner and my wireless keyboard and mouse became unresponsive. I diagnosed the problem after realizing it couldn't see my USB key either. All in all, a disappointing experience."
2,Doesn't work well with Windows 7,"I purchased two of these H7 hubs - one is connected to a new HP Pavilion laptop running Windows 7 and the other is connected to an iMac. The unit connected to the iMac works great - everything you plug into it connects perfectly. But the unit hooked up to the HP doesn't work as well. I can't plug usb memory drives into it - half the time they aren't recognized. My scanner doesn't work either when connected through this hub. All these devices work fine when they are plugged directly into the HP's usb ports and they even work when connected to a cheap $5 self-powered mini usb hub. I don't know if the problem lies in the H7 hub itself or Windows 7. I have other gripes about Windows 7, but those are for another review."
2,Unreliable,"I have had reliability issues with the product since its arrival. Regardless of how many items I have plugged in (2-4), most times when I boot my computer either the mouse or the keyboard was not picked up. If I unplug that device and plug it back it, it works fine. I called DLink and they said they would not replace it unless it had similar issues with another computer. It did. However, considering the cost (to me) to send the item back, this was not worth it, given that they could not guarantee that the next one would work. I pushed DLink to reimburse me for the shipping if they found that my device was in fact defective, but they refused. I will buy other brands in the future."
5,Perfect fit!,"This hub works perfectly to facilitate the high transfer rates of USB2 between my external HDs...priced right, too."
4,How long will it last?,"I have been using this D-Link hub for about six months. The power light started flickering after about three months and now doesn't light at all. The hub works great, but I wonder how long it will last."
5,Works perfectly out of the box.,"There is not much to say, It's a hub, powered by an external AC, small, compact, and functions perfectly out of the box."
4,USB hub keeps you upright,This is a good thing.Nobody has to rummage around behind the computer to plug in an iPod or camera.If you leave it plugged in it will even charge things while the computer is off.Works transparently.I like it.Edit:I am told in the comments that mystatement that it charges stuff when the computer is asleep are wrong.The commenter is probably correct on that. I don't know what I saw.At any rate this is still a very good hub.
4,usb hub,I am using this hub to connect a printer and scanner to a windors xp notebook. It works just fine. Was easy to set up. No Problems
4,Solid unit,"I bought this to replace a 4-port, USB 1.0 hub. Seems like a solid unit, Windows 7 has had no problems detecting or working with any devices I have plugged into it so far."
3,Good hub but problems...,I have used other d-link equipment in the past and have had good luck. Bought this to connect 2 National Instruments USB-6008 DAQ modules to my laptop. Everything seemed to connect well and I was clad this came with the power supply. The problem came when I ran the modules and kept locking up windows (XP Pro) to the point of requiring a reboot. The problem was very repeatable and I finally traced it to this hub after swapping it out for another simple USB hub (from Dynex) that worked well. Probably fine for most applications but definately NOT with NI USB hardware!
2,Problems with external Hard Drives,"Every time I connect an external hard drive to the hub it seems to shut down or crash. Sometimes that doesn't happen but the hard drive is not recognized by the computer (WIN 7 64bits). I've tried with several drives. It's always the same. The drives work perfectly when connected directly to the computer. However, it does work well with ""small"", less power hungry devices like pendrives, bluetooth dongles and others."
5,D-Link DUB-H7 High Speed USB 2.0 7-Port Hub,"This 7-port hub is exactly what I wanted. A plus feature of the D-Link DUB-H7, not mentioned in the ad, is that it is powered externally."
4,D-Link DUB-H7 USB 7 Port Hub,"D-Link DUB-H7 High Speed USB 2.0 7-Port HubPowered Hub, easy installation,it works as advertised with Mac OS X.Very reliable."
4,"Good item, fulfill the specs.","the product fits the bill: a lot of USB ports, a very light constructions, external power supply and A-to-B cable.The power supply does not come rated for 220V, onli 100-120V, and that is a problem if you travel."
2,"It's not heavy, it's my USB port","What did I want? A USB port that the USB CABLES (OR ITS OWN POWER SOURCE) WOULD NOT PULL OFF MY DESK.What did I get? Better... but no cigar.While not yanked off my desk like those ridiculous ovoid models that need to be adhered to your desk--which I don't want to do, to you?--still not heavy enough.It looked substantial. It looked like it laughed at the cables, so hungry to pull it to the floor.It's not. It barely sits there.I don't need a brick--lead, gold or otherwise, but I do need more than this thing.PLEASE SOMEONE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY make a USB port that has some heft."
4,"Works, but some drawbacks","It does work, but some drawbacks. For example, my printer gets an error message when I reboot if it is plugged into it. My Pocket PC will work in it fine, as will my camera and other devices, but if I update my pocket PC rom, have to plug it directly into the computer USB.So, it is a great hub with great speeds, just be aware that despite what most advertise, not everything works well in a USB hub, choose wisely."
5,Does the Job!,"I am very happy with this unit. Works great, easy to install, looks great. D-Link has a winner here for a good price!"
5,works just fine to expand your usb connections,"requires a/c plug in, then plugs into 1 usb 2.0 jack, and expands it into 7 usb 2.0 jacks. so, you get 6 more plugs. comes with necessary wires to plug into your desktop and a/c outlet. just plug your other stuff into the 7 open usb ports. it would be nice if amazon shows a typical installation, so you get an idea where to put this equipment in relation to other stuff. anyway, it works just fine. no problems after many years of use."
1,Awful Hub,I've had this hub for 2 months and for the last 2 weeks it has been randomly disconnecting and reconnecting the devices plugged into it. Then yesterday I discovered that only 4 of the seven ports were actually working. Up until then I only had 3 devices plugged in but I plugged in a flash drive yesterday and found that a couple ports didn't work at all and when I tried to copy files off it using two of the ports that I thought had been working they would disconnect in mid copy. Then today I couldn't print anything because the printer was too busy disconnecting/reconnecting and I couldn't use my web cam for the same reason. I finally got so frustrated that I went out and bought a Belkin and am tossing this in the trash. Worst USB hub I've ever owned; stay away from this one.
1,All of sudden keyboard doesn't work.....,"I had this product for over 2 weeks. I have a brand new computer wth Windows 7 and three times I had issues with either the mouse not working or the keyboard stop working.In addition, the power cord in the back of the unit falls out, I had to tape it down. In summary, this product is junk like most of the USB hubs out there, a lot of folks have problems with them (if not now, later they will)--- I'm going back to manually move out USB jacks when i need them. The quality is not there for these products yet, i mean they charge $15-$30 for this stuff, your not getting reliablity! They either burn out and/or disconnect periodically. I rather pay $100 for a commerical grade product, get it over with and not have the headaches."
4,Easy Setup & Excellent Value,"As is the case with most, with the proliferation of devices, I was in need of expanding my USB capacity. The D-LINK DUB-H7 provided excellent value and was extremely easy to setup - if you consider connecting the device to your system setup (-:. One watchout that I think has been covered in several reviews: As long as you connect 2.0 devices into the HUB, you will enjoy 2.0 speeds. Connecting 1.1 devices will limit the throughput of the unit(as it will with any HUB). This is clearly stated in the technical documentation provided.I have owned this unit for almost three months and haven't experienced any reliability issues. I would definitely recommend it.Good luck with your purchase."
5,D-Link is tops,"I had been using a Belkin F5U021 4-Port hub. My computer was constantly reporting Low USB power, I'd have to unplug something to get something else working. Since I replaced it with the D-link. No more Low USB messages; No more un-plugging.As a matter of fact I had previously replaced my LinkSys router (which I had to reset from time to time) with a D-Link. I've never had to reset the D-Link.Obviously, D-Link makes very good products.I highly recommend D-Link products."
2,Worked fine at the start....,"It worked fine at the start but within a week individual ports ceased to function (so far 2). Although I have populated all the ports most are not in constant use (Camera, GPS, Palm PDA, SD-reader). Seems like this should be able to handle all of this. Amazon replaced it but I'm still worried that the new one wont be any better."
3,Ports are loose,"Title says it all. At least on my 4 port unit. From the start the ports were loose, and you have to move the cable to make a connection even when plugged all the way in. When it works, it works good, other than the port connection."
3,Nice product but not perfect,"I have been using this with a MacBook Pro to expand on its lack of USB ports.I have connected keyboards, mice, mass storage devices, and several different iOS devices. It has worked flawlessly to connect and power any USB device I have thrown at it.The one problem I have with it is that it creates noticeable electrical interference. What do I mean by ""noticeable""? When I have my headphones plugged into the MacBook while the hub is plugged in, I can hear annoying electrical noise. If I connect USB devices directly to my laptop, I don't hear the noise.Annoying problem, but otherwise a good product which I use to organize a budget ""docking station"" for my laptop.A couple other things I wished this product would do, but it doesn't:- USB 3.0 support- Charge my USB-powered devices without a computer attached"
5,Still going strong years later,This product has been around for years for a good reason. It's helping run items on my arcade machine and has been running strong for more than 3 years
1,UNBELIEVABLE JUNK,"ZERO STARS!STAY FAR, FAR AWAY!THIS ITEM IS SUSPECT!1 - POWER DROPS. Whenever I wake my system, I see that an external HD has been ""disconnected unsafely.""2 - My Phone and Tablet refuse to be powered off it: I get a nice ""NOT CHARGING"" indicator.3 - *NEW* *NEW* *NEW* This POS refuses to power an external Blu-Ray drive. (I thought it was bad disks, a bad drive (worse)--until I realized I'd moved the connection...YOU BET I WAS RELIEVED!)CAN ANYONE RECOMMEND AN ACTUAL WORKING PRODUCT AVAILABLE--INSTEAD OF THIS PIECE OF JUNK?!"
4,Works well,Does just what it is supposed to do...no complaints. The price is right and I am well satisfied in all ways.
1,I also have the freezing problem,When connecting my Logitech Quikcam 4000 and my Logitech USB mouse through this HUB trouble is ahead.After starting a camera application (e.g. Yahoo Messenger) the mouse starts acting erratic and after a few seconds freezes completely. Disabling the camera application does not unfreeze the mouse.I checked with D-Link and they have no similar complaints on file so I am returning this Item to Amazon.com for a refund. and go with the advise of getting another hub.
5,Good Product,"We bought this powered hub for a desktop because some of our devices were not being recognized as USB 2.0 and we finally tracked the problem down to a power issue.The D-Link was immediately recognized by Windows XP. Further, TWO devices, that previously registered individually as USB 1 when connected directly to a USB port, were immediately shown as USB 2 when both were simultaneously connected to the hub.The price was right as is the performance. We recommend it."
1,I'm a little upset,"I really don't know why, but last night the keyboard and mouse that were plugged into the H7 quit working, then the computer flashed up a message that a USB port had been turned off because it was drawing too much power, the pilot lamp on the H7 started blinking, shut off, and then came back on. The burned electronics smell from my keyboard said something bad had happened, and sure enough, the hub and everything connected to it - except the PC, thankfully - are toast.Fortunately, nothing really expensive was killed, but it ticks me off that a device would damage other components as it failed. Stuff breaks - that's life - it just shouldn't be a murder-suicide."
2,Rumors are true: Does not properly power devices,"This hub does not power devices when the my computer is off or in sleep mode. As a matter of fact, if I leave my phone (a BlackBerry Storm) plugged into the hub, and walk away for an extended period of time, the battery on my phone will be drained as a result of being connected to the hub while the computer went into sleep mode. This is a deal-breaker for me, and I will be replacing it with a different hub.So although I feel misled by the specs, I'll give it at least two stars, since it does function well as a non-powered hub."
1,Must Change Plugs Every Time You Turn Computer On.,The hub I got requires me to re-plug my usb cords in to a different position every time I turn the computer on or my devices won't work. D-Link customer service is an even worse joke. After waiting on hold for over 30 minutes (twice) I was disconnected. As I didn't use this right away it was too late to return. Money totally wasted. A piece of garbage.
3,D Link DUB-H7,"I have several of these items and they are really a great USB hub. One thing, however, the newer power units take up three spaces on my power strips. Terrible design and I will not buy them again because of this."
2,"ok for basic usb, but doesn't power usb drives","If all you want to do is to connect basic usb devices that don't need power, then this works fine, I've had one for years, and it's worked without problems, except read below.However, if you have a device that needs power, such as a usb hard drive, then this will not do it for you: the drive will likely ""squeak"" at you, without connecting to your computer. Since I am able to charge some devices with this, my conclusion is that the power provided at the ports doesn't meet specs required for the higher-power devices such as disk drives. (I'm not an expert on USB specs, but you can do your research if this is important to you.) I'm going to have to throw this one away and replace it.Note: I have a similar device I bought from another online merchant (monoprice) which works perfectly for all the applications. And it was actually a bit cheaper.So I recommend against buying this model. Why not get an item that will do everything, at no extra cost?"
5,"I've owned this usb hub for years, it's been a great run","This little guy has served it's purpose for me for many years now, finally one of the ports died and I decided to upgrade.But, a device that has lasted as long as this one and is still kicking deserves some points - if I can get the same life out of the replacement hub, it's a win!"
4,Great so far.... but the lights are annoying,This is a pretty great product. I got it to replaced a burned out belkin hub. Its just unfortunate that they had to put LEDs on it. I taped them over. Don't they realize that people keep computers in their bedrooms?
1,Smoked my Flash... Farewell Hub,"I had been using this hub for about 9 months without problems and then one day I started getting an error on port 7. Unfortunately, it smoked my flash drive (goodbye data). Then, a few days later, the whole D-Link unit got really hot so I assume the voltage regulator has now completely failed. At this point I do not dare fate by plugging anything else into the unit so ... into the trash it goes... :("
3,Slow,"I bought this because I use plenty of USB devices and my computer only had 4 ports. I find that whatever I plug into it, run very slow and its best not to run two items simultaniously. I would not do this again."
2,Hangs my Mac on every boot,I love the solid design (all ports on one side) and performance of this hub but my Intel iMac will hang on every boot if I do not disconnect this hub. I had to replace it.
5,Works Great,Plugged it in and it worked right away. No drivers to install or any setup required. Lighted ports on the units face are a wonderful feature. Would buy this again and highly recommend it.
2,Unreliable,"This device works at first, then the various USB components mysteriously stop working every few days. Once you troubleshoot your system, and determine that the problem is your brand new USB hub, you can reset the thing by unplugging it from the power supply and USB cord, and then plugging it back in. Then everything will again work fine for a few days.This is quite inconvenient, and has happened to my mouse, keyboard, printer, and scanner. I have yet to find a USB device that will work reliably with this thing.Although it may be possible that I have a defective unit, I suspect that the problems I have had are due to the design of this unit.I also bought this (cheaper) unit:Belkin USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra Mini Hub F5U407I have not encountered similar issues with the cheaper (four port) unit. So decide for yourself."
2,fine while it lasted,"Have one of these hooked up to my Airport Extreme router so its single USB port can accomodate a printer and a hard drive. Worked great until the other day, when I realized only one of the little indicator lights was on -- all the ports but one are now dead. Tried disconnecting/reconnecting and no dice. I've been using one of the larger D-Link 7 port hubs separately and it's always worked fine, so I bought this one to supplement it. Maybe I got a bad one, but I'm still out 20 bucks for a dead hub I got to use for maybe a year and a half."
5,Couldn't be any better!,Plug in it and you're up and running with 7 USB ports. What more is there to say - working great!
5,Absolutely love it,"After reading several reviews and receiving a recommendation for this hub, I decided to purchase it. The price is great too. I was actually surprised by the size and weight. It is unbelievably small and light and can fit just about anywhere. I've been using it for some time now and works wonderfully. People claim that theirs winds up braking/malfunctioning after a while, mine hasn't yet but I will say that if it were to brake/malfunction, I will most likely buy another one, which I highly doubt will happen."
4,D-Link Hub,"I love the hub, but it is so small, even with velcro tape, it is hard to keep it tied down. The weight of the USB cables keeps twisting it loose and it falls over. But a good product!"
3,Has problems when multiple device is in used,"This device works great when there's not much going on, but once in awhile it gets into a state that none of the connected devices can be detected. I would then have to unplug the USB hub and replug it back in. You tend to see a lot more issues when multiple devices connected are active. I had to move my USB mouse and keyboard off it because losing them became too frequent."
5,Great product,"I especially appreciate all seven ports neatly lined up in front, greatly simplifies cable management."
4,Works as expected,D-Link DUB-H7 High Speed USB 2.0 7-Port Hub ww.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008VFAF/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleJust be sure to connect to computer and let driver initialize before connecting any devices.
2,Won't transfer data to External drive,"Works for everything EXCEPT data transfer.I tried 3 times to backup my files, but got Data Error.My old ""cheap Chinese"" hub works fine every time."
2,Not for Macs,Incompatible with the new MacBook Pro. My Apple keyboard will not always work when plugged into this hub. I have to remove and reinsert it into my Mac. It's a nuisance.
5,Heavenly!!!,I produce music and i require all of the ports for my equipment. This product helps my work flow tremendously.
4,Nice hub,"This hub is great, although I do wish it was weighted a bit more so it would not pull easily off of my desk."
3,D-Link QuickMedia DUB-H7 7-Port USB 2.0 Hub,"The Good:- It works.- Design: Placing the ports in a row on their edge, is a real space saver.- Design: Power and cable to PC plug in ones side, connections to peripherals plug into the other.The Not So Good:- Every port is lit even when there is nothing plugged into it. On a previous USB hub I had (that this replaced) the ports only lit when there was a connection. I think this is more sensible and usefull.- Owner's manual says you must use the external power supply. When I first connected it to the PC I hadn't yet connected the power supply and it worked! If I run out of outlets I may try that again, but I keep it powered by the power supply as documented anyhow to avoid any possible problems."
5,Great hub that actually works!,D-Link's 7-port hub works perfectly -- you plug it into a USB port and it's ready to roll. It's that simple.
5,Great little hub!,"I got this hub to deal with the overflow of USB 2.0 devices I have been accumulating. It came promptly, the rebate was great, and it is working beautifully! I really recommend it!"
4,worked as advertised,"Well, this is a simple USB 2.0 hub. Everything worked as advertised. I had a problem when plugging the AC unit into a socket that already has another power adaptor from Compusa. It made my Compusa adaptor whine."
5,Great,"Great USB Hub- I use this item specifically for connecting GoFlight and CH Products simulator gear for my full size Learjet 45 simulator. It has worked flawlessly, and it's nice and small too.Wise purchase here!"
5,Great Hub,"I saw this hub at a friend's house and he loves it! Now I can see why!! The hub comes with a slimline power supplies that doesn't block other plugs on the strip and it works great!I've got 3 iPods, USB speakers and a screen calibration device on it so far and I've never experienced any problems (so far)."
4,USB Hub does the job for laptop expansion,"I have not put this product to any extensive tests. I use it when my laptop is on my desk so that I only have one USB plug to plug in and out. My printer, trackball, and camera are all plugged into the Hub. I can plug the Hub into the laptop, and all the devices auto connect up just fine."
4,D-Link DUB-H7,"This USB device is an extention of the USB ports on the back of your computer and it has the added convienience of more ports where you want them. The DUB-H7 is very easy to install so anyone can do it and works very well, I would definately recommend this product to any one interested in connecting an additional high speed USB port to thier computer"
5,Usb Hub,"Works great...just plug and play. Now my magic jack, printer, and mouse all work at the same time."
3,Basic Hub!,"As the title explains, It's just a basic hub, where you plug your USB devices and work.I don't see the point of the lights, they just stay on all the time, whether a device is connected or not, if one of your devices stop working, you don't really know which is the cable that belongs to it, unless you labeled each and every one of them, I have a couple of hubs that show which port is failing, lights are turned on on working devices only, if a connected device stops working then its light will turn off, I thought this Dlink hub would work the same way.The USB cable that comes with it is useless, maybe I had bad luck on that one, I had to get another one."
2,NOT QUITE UP TO SNUFF,"I purchased this about 2 months ago. I though that I would be able to plug everything into this. Wrong"" If you put to many large items, scanner, printers etc. it will over load the usb port. Not worth worth me getting rid of my 2 4-port usb."
3,"Powered Hub but, not enough power for large items","I replaced an old USB hub with this new one expecting MORE power with the new 2.0 hubs. I was not able to run my USB Scanner from this new HUB. It is only useful for small items like Mice, Keyboards and MP3 players. It is not a bad product just don't expect to run everything you buy for it."
3,7 port USB HUB,Seems to work alright using 4 or less of the 7 links. Problems using all 7. Would have been better off buying a 4 unit.
3,OK but not the answer,"I was a bit disappointed, the USB 2.0 works but drains so much feed through that it is not necessarily effective - at least not on my Mac G5. Maybe works wonderful on PCs but for me - it didn't cut it for the mac. D-Link is a great company and is a highly recommended supplier. This product just didn't offer the solution I was looking for."
3,Beware of D-Link Rebate Policies,"The USB hub is fine...it is a USB hub, so how great or bad can it be? It works with all of my devices and it's small...like every other USB hub I have ever bought.However, D-Link did not honor my rebate. Unlike the other poster who got a phone number to call, I only got a card in the mail with an address stating that I need to resubmit. I sent them a letter explaining that Amazon is not excluded on their form (some retailers are) and showing them a printout of the Amazon page with a link to the rebate form.It has been about 1 month since I did that and they have not replied. I am not keeping my hopes up about that $10."
1,Wouldn't even run the keyboard...,"I'm baffled, too. I don't know why a powered hub won't run my MacAlly iceKey keyboard, or my Canon S600 printer, or the brand new CanoScan LiDE60 scanner I had bought to use it with, but it looks as if I'm back to square one. All of the above items worked as soon as I plugged them straight into my MacMini's USB ports. Everything lights up I've plugged and unplugged the hub, and each time I get the ""low power"" warning, even for the keyboard. A hub like this is supposed to be plug and play, especially on a Mac. Something is wrong, somewhere. I've wasted an evening trying to get it to work. I'm out UPS 2Day shipping, but I'm sending it back."
2,Did not work as advertised with my iMac,"This is a nice, small, inexpensive hub with clear instructions. Unfortunately, it does not seem to work with Macs as advertised. When I tried to use it with my iMac G5, it would not work with powered USB devices (hp laser printer, powerwave, and ipod). My camera's download cable worked OK, but I didn't buy the hub just to plug one device in. I found a web page online that suggested other Mac users have had this problem with the hub. But neither the D-Link web site nor the Apple web site included any information about the problem I had."
2,Failed after 1 year,Mine won't work all the time with higher current devices like a scanner and external USB Hard Drive. I worked with these devices previously. I do have the external power plug connected to the hub.
1,Not suitable for all USB drives,"I purchased this item to connect several external USB 2.0 hard drives (Iomega, Western Digital and Western Digital Passport). It did not work well with some of the drives for no apparent reason. It is very likely that this hub is underpowered.It works well with external DVD burner (Sony), USB trackball and mouse.If you are looking for a universal USB hub, make sure it can provide enough power for external drives."
2,Practically useless,"Purchased so that I could plug my keyboard, mouse, and external harddrive into my laptop. Works wonderfully powering the drive, which would not power itself off the computers built in hub, but has major intermittent keyboard/mouse issues. I'm using a Microsoft Natural Ergo 4000 and a Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer - neither have given me problems plugged directly into the computer or other computers, but plugged in to this hub I get mouse dropouts (even the laser light blinks out) and repeated key presses (every 1-30min, the last key I pressed will get typed a dozen times). This makes it incredibly frustrating when typing, and removes the value in the device. I've since plugged the keyboard/mouse directly into the computer and just have the harddrive on the hub - just as much of a pain as it was before when I have to plug/unplug everything to move."
4,Decent Charging Hub,"This is a decent hub for use as a charger for USB-powered devices. Two of the ports provide 1.2 amps of power and are iDevice-compatible. The other ports don't provide as much power, but work fine for my cell phone and (non-iPad) tablet. The remaining ports would not power an iPad, iPhone 4, or iPod Touch devices I own, so if all your charging needs are Apple-generated, I would steer clear.If the remaining five ports charged Apple devices and the two ""Fast charge"" ports put out the standard 2 amps for fast charging of USB devices, this would easily be a five-star device."
1,Not enough power for iPad,"This hub doesn't provide enough power to charge an iPad unless it is in ""high power"" mode, and the only way put it in high power if it is connected to a Mac is to unplug it. Not very usefull"
5,Great product,A few USB ports burnt out on my computer and this comes in handy. Def a great product. BUY IT NOW
1,Not enough power,"I have a multitude of accessories for my computer including a scanner, printer, memory card reader and an ipod. The hub only works with accessories that have their own power sources. If I plug in any of the accessories without their own power sources (like the ipod or keyboard) I get a low USB power notice and cannot communicate with the attatched accessory. Even though this hub has its own power supply, it only alots a certain amount of power to each port, thereby decreasing the amount of power each accessory can use. I would not recommend this product and would return it if I could."
1,Do not buy if you plan to use with a mac,"I purchased this USB HUB to replace an older D-Link hub connected to my iMac that does not supply enough juice to charge my iPad. I received the D-Link DUB-H7 today, and after reading the manual, I connected it. I connected my iPad next but noticed it was not charging as expected. I looked at the manual closer and found that in order to charge an ipad, I can either disconnect the HUB from my mac, or shut my computer off completely. This is completely unacceptable and a major hassle. I will be returning this HUB and looking for another one that meets my needs.D-Link DUB-H7 High Speed USB 2.0 7-Port Hub"
1,The external power seems to light the (useless) lights only and not power the extra ports,"I've used this for over a year and never suspected until reading here that all my troubles seem to be because the external power hook-up is to power the always on useless green lights, and not to supply extra power to the ports. If this is true, then no wonder my external drives would sometimes disconnect at random, or my iPad would not charge reliably. Ugh, if only I'd known earlier. Why would they make something like that except into fooling you it's something it's not. Very disappointed! Oh well, I'll miss the Christmas tree effect of the useless green lights at nite, but not my external hard drives going off line at random."
4,"My favorite USB hub, but not as a USB charger!","I own two of these USB hubs and have recommended them to others. But right now, I'm a bit disappointed, because I primarily want to charge USB devices with no computer attached to the hub, and this hub won't do that, even with the AC adapter plugged in. Still, if you want a convenient powered USB hub with lots of ports, and you mostly want to connect devices to your computer, this is the hub I'd recommend!"
1,Compatibiliy and Reliability problems,"The upper limit on my D-Link 7-port hub seems to be four devices regardless of whether they are self powered. Some devices don't work properly in one port, but do in another, even if they are the only devices plugged into the hub. Furthermore, some devices seem to collide through the hub. For example, only two of my USB drives will run concurrently. Worse, I've seen data corruption when a drive is plugged into four of the seven ports; I thought a La Cie USB hard drive was defective until I plugged it directly into the PC. The center three ports seem to blank out occasionally, but recover after a reboot.I'm on Amazon now looking for a more reliable replacement. My experience with D-Link products has been more miss than hit.One final nit is the power connector jack is a right angle type and is a bit loose. I had to improvise a strain relief with tape."
5,Supports 5+ External HDs where others failed,"Unlike my previous Belkin High-Speed USB 2.0 7-Port Hub which would support only 3 external HDs, this DLink hub flawlessly supports 5+ HD.Highly recommended"
2,Not so good,"I have used the D-Link DUB-H7 USB 7-port Hub for a little over a year. Previously I used their combination USB and Firewire for almost ten years without a single problem so I didn't hesitate to entrust D-Link for a full USB hub. 6 months in, one of the plastic widgets that held the USB plug in place fell out; without it, the plug hole is useless. A few weeks ago, another plastic widget fell out. Now I have only 5 usable holes (outlets). Now, lately I have to unplug the powered hub to get it restarted. Time for a new USB hub, but it won't be a D-Link."
5,good produst,"It is working great, I will give it a 10,m but it does not comply to the european WIT standarts and Mongolian ttt20 specs."
3,LImited Power....,"This is a great product, but it has very limited in power. I noticed that if I connected too many high powered devices (such as hard drives) everything slows down. Sometimes I lose lower to my external hard drives. If I use this product for USB keys, keyboard, or just charging, then its okay. I'm not sure how many volts each port carries, but its not enough to use with multiple hard drives."
1,Don't Buy !!!,"The worst. The digital control malfunctioned and Krups has said, without reviewing it, that it is not repairable! I now have a $90.00 toaster that is no better than one used by my grandmother in the 1920's. How a major corporation like Krups can be so irresponsible is beyond me. Buy American! If you can find it!"
5,My ferrets love it.,"My ferrets love this food, and it is one of the few foods I've found that seems to actually reduce the odor one often generally associates with ferrets. Sadly, it seems to be becoming harder and harder to find, which is why I started buying it through Amazon."
5,Hippo does not dissapoint!,"What a unique an excellent book ""Hippo"" is! If you have ever heard James Ryle in person, he speaks like he writes, in an amusing, simple yet profound manner. That is exactly how he comes across in this book. He tackles a very, very difficult subject with story, witt, and lots of scripture (that is very appreciated). Most of the contents of this book came as a fresh breeze of new insight. How very much we as Christians need to allow God to be God in our lives and speak to us how He sees fit! This is what this book addresses and succeeds at relaying. That's why I highly recommend this book to you if you are looking for fresh insight to having a one-on-one relationhip with God. For, God does speak today, in a variety of ways! What is He saying to you?"
5,Hippo in the Garden,A book that bears rereading from time to time. Always fresh no matter how many times you do. Informative and thought provoking.
2,does not work very well.,Too loud and does not work very well. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Never really warms up the small bathroom we have it in.
3,Not well made but it works.,I needed to replace a heater like this in a rental house. They are not well made so they last two to three years before giving problems. The original one that was made in the US lasted 15 or 20 years. The last two have lasted no more than three years each.
4,Replace that old flush mount heater in your bathroom,It was not easy to replace the 30 year old broken one in my bathroom but that is probably related more to my lack of electrician skills than the design of the device. It works as well or better than the one it replaced.
3,"Works for a few years, then dies","We've owned our home for 9 years and I just ordered my 3rd replacement of this same heater. It works great for 2 years, heating our 150 square foot bathroom. Then the insulators start breaking and it begins to rattle. When the insulators break, the safety thermostat shuts it down after a few minutes and so it doesn't warm the bathroom. I use two-stage epoxy to hold the insulators in place and give it another year, but then it's time for a new one. They're cheap and easy to replace, but don't go thinking it's a lifetime investment."
2,Mine had a design flaw,"The 154 model I bought did not have sufficient space between the heat plate and the cap, which caused a lack of airflow which then caused it to over-heat just after a few minutes of operation. The old one it replaced had about a 3/4"" stand-off that allowed ample flow. If yours is restricted too, you may need to add something behind the plate screws to increase the separation between the two plates. I did that and it now moves air similar to the old one. If it wasn't for that, this one works just like the old one, which lasted 24 years."
2,Not a favorite,Heater works ok but these tend to go out after a short time period (less than a year) in our case. The price isnt bad but not a reliable heating source for long periods of time. Not recommended for anything bigger than a very small bathroom.
2,Fishing and Hunting magazine,I thought this would be about the great Colorado outdoors that I could use for an upcoming 1 month Colorado vacation. It is primarily a hunting and fishing magazine. I am a photographer.
1,Short Time Use Only,"Battery Life dropped of sharply after c. 8 months. When I contacted Customer Service my RMA request was declined on the basis of the Mfg. date. My purchase date did not seem to be a factor. Customer Svc would not even issue a case number. My 4 yr old OEM battery outperforms the 1.03 yr old BTI by 200+%.The representative was courteous but, I never felt he was there to give the customer service.--Gotta go I'm now running on reserve power (honest)--"
1,Terrible,I dont really know what to say. I was expecting a lot more from amazon. The case was flimsy and the cover was obviously printed out from the computer. When I opened it the disc was cracked in half. I'm very disappointed
1,Pay Attention!!! It wont play on your machine!,"Yes, It was my fault. I was in a hurry, tired and nearing XMAS and I didnt pay attention to the red letter statement saying this DVD would not play on regular player, it has some other world region requirement to play. Anyway, Maybe if I post this negative review someone else wont make the same mistake I did."
3,Hello,Overall the movie chances are was kinda stupid but it had a good idea I guess hello hello hello hello hello
1,Blank VHS Tape,"I was very disappointed when I played this video tape. I tried to give this a no-star rating, but the site wouldn't let me, which is why I'm giving it a rating of ""1."" I love this movie and previously owned it on VHS. I loaned my copy to a friend who never returned it. I then ordered a new VHS copy through Amazon, since it was very inexpensive. Since I've seen the movie numerous times, I didn't open the tape when I first received it. In fact, I waited about a year before I decided to watch it. When I put the tape into my VCR, it was completely blank - no movie at all! However, since a year had passed, I figured it was too late to do anything about it. Lesson learned....always open the product and use it immediately after purchasing!"
3,Delightful!,"I was a fan of Downey's before this film, but this is the one what made me totally fall in love with him. He was so sweet, sincere and believable in this film. He's a versatile and excellent actor, possibly one of the best of his generation!"
5,Favorite Movie Ever,"I love this movie, it is the best movie ever. I like it so much I have become obssesed with it. I'm dying ot buy it but I don't find it anywhere because it's too old. Robert Downey Jr looks so cute in that movie I could just eat him up. I desperately need this movie in my stock. I'm totally in love with it. I've been asking my sister to get for me and she can't find it anywhere! That is so rude! I think they should sell more of the movie in shopping stores, I least they would make a lot of monw\ey with me trying to buy that movie! Well, Bye!"
4,A bit on the technical side,"This book seems to have a great deal of information. Unfortunately it leans a bit more on the technical side than I expected or hoped for. Given the cost of this book, I'm hoping I can find some useful information in it. Had I been able to look through this book before buying it, I may have given it some careful consideration beforeplopping down the money.With the info in his book, it would be a good deal at half the cost, but at $70+ its a bit over priced.I'm not saying its a bad book. Its just too expensive. I've bought other specialized books that were just asgood and I didn't pay more than $35 for them.My recommendation on this would be to get a look at it before you buy it."
5,A Dark Halo: Catalyst,This CD is one of the best I own. I like every song on the CD and I would recommend it to anyone who likes hard rock/metal music. Especially if you were ever a fan of Pantera.
5,Its a service manual,Got this for much less than Fleabay wanted. Does what it should which is provides much needed tech info. These bikes are very complicated and this breaks them doen to easier sections.
1,I'm In You? Is This guy kidding?,"I'm not sure how to give praise for an album full of pop love tunes which is called ""I'm in you"" The late great Frank Zappa had much to say on this subject, and like Frank I have to say to the women of the world, if you think having a man say ""I'm in you"" is romantic, then this album must be for you. I think, despite the serious delivery Mr. frampton gives, that he must be kidding when he says ""I'm in you, I'm in you, I'm in you"" or else he's totally weird."
3,I'm Somewhere in the Middle,"This is one of the albums which have been placed in the 'too-hard' basket for too long. Following up the super-albums of the 70's was something which most artists felt overwhelming. Look at 'Rumours' or 'Hotel California', both subsequent releases were deemed not-as-good as the previous, causing enormous friction within Fleetwood Mac and Eagles respectively.I can only guess that Frampton headed for the middle ground and put together 'I'm in You' useing much the same fomula as his realeases from the early 70's .. material which included his trademark 'guitar-speak' and other influences including the work of the band Little Feat.With this in mind, 'Im in You' is a friendly MOR album, aimed squarely at the Top 40 charts (it went to Billboard's #2 in July 1977). One of his last charting albums, this 1977 release deserves more discussion so I will welcome anyone with further ideas."
1,Too stoned...,"I too saw Frampton live several times, as a warm up act, and had purchased Frampton's Camel, Wind of Change, Something's Happening etc. He had talent and he was basically a nice guy who worked very hard at every performance to give a good show. Then he hit the BIG time with FCA. The pressure was on him to put out a HUGE album, to capitalize on his new notoriety, and fast. What we got was this album. An album that sounds like every bad album made from the 70's cocaine/marijuana drug era. You can find where this happened to artists and bands over and over. Sometimes they just OD and die. Peter, instead, killed his new found fame. And fast."
1,Bad,"I remember looking forward to Frampton's follow up to Comes Alive back in 1977, but after seeing the cover of the album in the record store being too embarrassed to buy it. Pretty boy in sissy cloths - I didn't want to be caught with that. After hearing it later, I was glad I never got it. It was definitely a love song album for teen girls. Love songs heavy with strings and synths. This album ( and the Sgt Pepper movie) was a real career killer for Frampton which is a shame because he did much better later. He is still playing well and has put out some really good albums in the last few years. Still rockin. But I'm in You is bad."
1,"PETER ""MANILOW"" FRAMPTON","Uau, one must have real courage to buy an album with this kind of cover art and still says that Frampton is a rocker.... What a shame, coming after his hit FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE...."
2,Not so hot,"Following on the heels of great success for Frampton, this album was a letdown. ""Tried to Love"" is OK, and ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours"" was written by a better musican, but the rest is not so great. The title cut reeks of mediocrity. Don't Put Your Heart on the Line for this one."
2,Not his best,"I am surprised by many of the reviews rating this a 4 or 5 star album! It does have some good songs, but NOTHING that is great, and a few stinkers. I'm in You , the title cut is a good ballad. Two of the other songs that are good were not even written by Frampton (Road Runner and Signed, Sealed, Delivered) The other good cut is called "" You Don't Have to Worry"". Also lacking is Frampton's guitar playing. It certainly wasn't the same quality as ""Camel"" or ""Something Happening""...He had just gotten really big, and it seems that someone advised him to to do something different than what got him to the top. If you like frampton, get it....If you are trying him on for size, try something else!"
3,Chord Diagrams too small to read - and set up for Gutiars,"The six-string chord diagrams are too small to read. They are playable with a Ukulele however; they are depicted with six strings and labeled with the corresponding guitar chord key names not the ukulele chord key names. This means you will be learning the wrong names for the chords with this book.The lyrics are excellent. The music when played sounds right.I would be happier if there were two books, one for guitar players and one for ukulele players. I am now back on the hunt for a IZ Song Collection written for Ukulele players. Overall I am not satisfied with this edition of the song book."
5,Braddah IZ,"Dakine IZ songbook with fifteen of his hits from various albums. This book, the guitar/ukulele edition, is to the point, just the music, no introductions, although it does have several photos and a table of contents, listing which album each song is from. It assumes that the owner is familiar with Braddah IZ's work and expects a buyer also familiar with reading music. The finger placement charts are a little small, albeit the chord is also listed above the chart allowing the changes to be made with ease. I would have liked this song book to come with a cd of the music alone, that would have been ono kine. But as is, a good book with classic songs. Mahalo."
5,A small update to comments,"I agree with the majority of what is being said here with one exception, that concerning Guitar vs Ukulele chords being supplied. For those who may not realize it a couple of points:1. The chord diagrams supplied are actually for the Baritone Ukulele. Look closer and notice that there are two strings in the diagram not used (The E and A strings which are the difference for the Baritone Ukulele.2. Capo at fret 5 of a guitar or baritone ukulele results in the Standard ""C"" (G-C-E-A) tuning I believe.In short, what you need for the most part is provided for you with a little insight from you."
3,IZ: The song book collection,A little expensive but good for lyrics. Near useless for exclusive ukelele players as entire is for guitar with capo at 5th fret.
2,"Love IZ but the book is NOT really for ukulele, misleading title","The book has the chords and tabs for several popular IZ songs, but ALL the chord diagrams and tab diagrams are for guitar. And while yes you could just look at the letter and play the G chord or F chord on an Ukulele, the tab diagrams do not help for finger picking on ukulele."
4,"Informative, fun, amusing",I previewed this book in a store so I knew what I was getting - did not disappoint. It's a good gift for a young man (or woman) so he or she can be comfortable with civility and avoid embarrassing gaffs.
5,Great book,"Love this book series on etiquette, great gift for teenagers, young men, or any age male. Very easy to read, great for coffee table reading."
2,if you buy this book,If you buy this book it is not necessary to buy any of the other in the series. They each say the same thing.
2,This is written for someone who does not understand American Culture,I bought this book thinking it would be a helpful book of manners. It is very simplistic and approaches manners as if the reader has no sense of American culture. I would suggest this book for someone from another country trying to understand the basics of manners in America. I would not recommend this book for someone who is just trying to improve on common knowledge.
2,"sent me the wrong book, but let me keep it, with full refund","They sent me the wrong book, but gave me a full refund promptly, and let me keep the item."
3,"Entertaining, light read + some good advice","If you often say the wrong thing or struggle with awkward moments (I do), this may be a good choice for you. You will find no discussion of table manners, proper attire, or other mannerly concerns. This book is all about conversation. A reasonable person will know most of the material here, but I am very confident that you will find 5 to 10 suggestions that you can use to navigate awkward situations. That makes it worth the price."
3,Not Durable,"We received this as a gift. After less than a year of occasional use, a tip broke off. We had to throw the fork away. Also, it could not be placed in the dishwasher. I would not purchase this item again."
3,"Ok, but that's all","The one problem I have with this, (other than I found it a lot cheaper in local stores) is the shape and thickness of the tines. One should be able to use this fork for turning, etc as well as checking temperature. The thickness of the tines makes this a very chancy operation."
1,bad product,Same problem as already reported. One Tip broke off after taking it out of the hamburger that was on the grill
5,Great product,"Great quality leather, tight fit and a definite improvement to any car. Great for covering up nicks, or front end dents."
4,Joan Baez again,"This is still reasonably early Joan Baez. Her voice is strong and clear, the songs have a real folk quality. This is an ""enjoyment"" album. I am not belittling the compilation when I describe it as a great album for playing in the car. The miles just roll by."
4,Another excellent book.,"The aircraft of the aces series has been an excellent begining source of information. I beleive that there are better books covering each thing in more deapth. But as an introduction to each topic I have found none better. This book is on the nightfighters of the German Luftwaffe. Covering the aircraft briefly, but the focus of this series is the men who flew them. From it's humble beginings to the nightfighter force becoming a much needed group. If you have an interest in this area then this book is a good place to start. Great photos and colour plates of aircraft and pilots. A very good read."
4,"Very Best of War is good, but may be over kill","I have always like War, however, I am not a diehard or really knowledgeable fan. This collection was a bit more War than I really needed. Perhaps with a bit more listening, many of the more obscure songs will grow on me. If you are that diehard or very knowledgeable fan, perhaps it IS for you."
5,Bridge the generaion gap.,"There are few groups my daughter and I both share an interest in, (35yr age difference) this is one of them...she's been singing ""Low Rider"" word for word since she was 4, to the amazement of my co-workers at the tire company I worked at. This CD covers all the best hits, not just one or two like most."
1,songs are cut off,"My favorite songs from War are ""Smile Happy"" ,""City, Country, City"", and ""Four Cornered Room.""I listened to the first two and realized that they have been cut considerably. I bought this CD to hear those 3 songs but since they are much, much shorter than the originals. I want my money back. I never would have purchased a CD where the songs are just samples of the originals. What's the point?"
2,This process is about getting gouged!,"Anyone going through the process of getting an internship placement knows that one gets gouged financially. Too bad that Dr. Megargee has to join in. The really useful information in this book could be condensed into a small booklet. Instead, the authors (and likely the publisher) have added tons of ""fluff"" (common sense information) to make this a ""book"" for which they can charge full price. I reluctantly recommend this book for the 10 or so pages that ARE helpful."
3,"Beautifully presented, but not very detailed","This is a very nicely presented book. It is a conveniently sized hardcover with attractive dust cover, and has excellent pictures. It can even be used as a coffee table book.With regard to the content, there are some very good ideas, but firstly, some of the items required are not easy to get, and secondly, the more complicated projects do not have enough detail in the instructions.I also found that some of the projects don't look that good if you take away the fancy settings and lighting effects used for the photographs.Not a bad book, but it's more for show than function"
2,Lovely photography but few details and some odd ideas,"The best thing about this book is the photography, which is lovely. What is being photographed ranges from the mundane to the odd, and the ideas rarely said ""Christmas!"" to me. For instance, for the white decorating scheme the author suggests tying string around a white rock and putting it on the napkin in your placesetting. The author gives few details on how to achieve the looks she writes about. I was very disappointed."
2,Nothing new here,"This is an ok Christmas decorating book, but I learned nothing new. Has some nice ideas, but certainlynot a wow-er."
1,Krups sandwich maker way too small!,This sandwich machine is way too small. Cannot handle most bread slice sizes and ingredients ooz out of machine while cooking. This cooker only works if you use SMALL bread and very little filling. Definitely a waste of money.
2,THE FIRST DISAPPOINTMENT FROM CRITERION...,"Until now, Criterion has been recognized as the undisputed leader in film resoration for transfer to DVD. With PYGMALION, they make a very disappointing stumble. The package states that this is a ""gorgeous new transfer, with digitally restored image and sound"". I'm sure this is what they intended, but the product does not reflect either restored image or sound. It is, on the whole a good print, though not at all up to the normal Criterion quality. It is - in places - terrible. And the sound is all over the map. Yes, it can be heard, but because of a poor audio mix, one has to raise and lower the volume with almost every scene. Criterion remains by far the best distributor of DVDs, but they should be told by their consumers that in this case, the product is plainly not deserving of the Criterion name."
5,Get the Essential Art House edition instead of this one,"I won't dwell on the wonderful qualities of this adaptation of Shaw's most famous theater piece. I won't tell you how superb the actors are. I won't insist that this film is a must for your collection. I'll simply recommend that you purchase the Essential Art House DVD rather than paying a premium for this edition, which virtually the same disc. There are no extras on either, and spending up to twice as much for a brief essay on an insert is simply not reasonable."
3,Pygmalion,"This review is for the AAE release (NOT the Criterion Collection). The film itself is great - I understand why some questioned the need or desirability of turning this into a musical (although I loved My Fair Lady also).My beef with this particular DVD is that it is NOT indexed by chapters of any kind (you must watch the film from start to end or you lose your place) and the transfer is not so good. Since I haven't seen the Criterion version, I can't compare the image quality. I surely HOPE it's better."
4,A great film that begs for restoration,"I have loved this film for years, but why hasn't anyone begun the task of restoring this fine, old flick? Leslie Howard is great as Dr. Higgins and Wendy Hiller is the very best Eliza (with apologies to the legendary Audrey Hepburn)."
5,quality product/ quick delivery,This product is pretty good 4 the price. i weigh 192 bls & i can pull myself up with it. quick delivery
3,A much needed release - but who forgot the texts?,"Monteverdi lovers will be delighted to see this disc appear, and sure enough Vartolo and his three soloists deliver good performances of the complete set of 18 scherzi, published 1607 - the same year as Orfeo.Naxos deserves thanks for releasing this repertoire but somebody seems to have blundered; the brief introductory note (by Vartolo?) ends ""...will be apparent from the texts, given later in this booklet."" But no sign of texts whatsoever. Same is true of the Canzonette volume 8.553316 released at the same time.If you want to see Naxos at their best consider instead the selected Lamenti (3 volumes to date) which Vartolo has been recording since February 1995. These contain full texts, English translations and rarely heard music by Monteverdi's contemporaries."
2,They don't sound like they're having fun,"I fell in love with Monteverdi's -Scherzi Musicali- after finding a sprightly favourite record of this work with the Boston Camerata.Bought this one in hopes of replacing that aging vinyl. It is no match for it. The tempo here is too often sluggish. Some more instrumental colours would be nice here, too: pieces like -I bei legami- beg for recorders or flutes added to the mix. Instead, all of the ritornelli are played on violins, and towards the middle of the programme it begins to drag.This is essentially simple early Baroque music, written for amateur musicians to have fun with. There doesn't seem to be much life here, unfortunately."
4,Good information,This book was good information for the general questions that you might have about hummingbirds. It definately could have gone into more detail. The book is not very long so they did use what space they had well.
1,Don't waste your money.,"This book is written as if you had a degree in animal or plant science. It is small enough they should have shipped it in an envelope, but to get more than they asked for the price of the book. They send it in a box the size of a cell phone box so they can charge you $3.95 for S&H. I am very disappointed with the purchase."
2,Very tiny book,"I had purchased this as a gift, so I did not read it. An earlier customer had rated the pictures in it as incredible, but I was very disappointed. For the price I was expecting a much larger book, or at least better quality. I would have paid 2 or 3 dollars for this, at most. It's pamphlet thin."
5,Wonderful book,"I love this book because I learned things I normally wouldn't ever had know about these amazing lil' creatures. From one thing I learned, I'll have my feeders up now, year round. Needing the fuel for energy. If anyone is a bird lover or just love learning new things, this is a good book for that."
1,not worth the money,I purchased this tape anticipating more of Paula Poundstones great stand up material and was disappointed. This is a tape of two shows with a brief monologe at the beginning followed by alot of lame guests and skits. Not worth the money even though it was cheap. Wait for her stand-up routines on TV if you are a true fan.
4,Pretty Funny,"If you are a fan of Paula Poundstone, especially her way of audience interaction, I would recomend this tape. I personally think that she is hilarious, and one of my favorite things is to listen to her talk to the audience. This tape has plenty of Paula Poundstone talking to normal people, and her own great style of humor.I wish the show would have survived. I think had there been celebrity guests, instead of common people, it would have been better received. I could have done without the musical guests, but overall I think this is a highly enjoyable tape."
2,Hardly ever used it,"Cute bouncer. Looked nice in the corner of the playroom. Hardly ever used it, though, because it bored my daughter stiff. To be fair, she liked listening to the various sounds, as long as we didn't make her do it while sitting in the bouncer.Also, the bar quickly became deformed (it popped off one side and wouldn't stay back on). I ended up detaching the rabbit and bears from the bar and giving them to my daughter to play with and then stored the chair itself in our basement.We had much more luck with the Fisher Price Soothing Motions Glider. One of my daughter's favorite things to do in her pre-sitting up days was to lie back in that chair and rock back and forth while listening to music. Sometimes we'd even get a nap out of it."
4,A latin music surprise!,"Well I bought this greatest hits recognizing that I just heard three songs, but all the songs are wonderful."
3,One problem,"I have been satisfied with my first Timex Expedition for some time, until by my own carelessness, it became damaged. I then decided to replace it with another Expedition watch. I selected this one but in the first week, the ""crystal"" had become scratched. Upon further research, I found the Expedition line uses different types of lenses on various models. I used the first watch daily for about two years, without a single mark on the lens. I suggest you carefully check the specifications for this product."
1,From the House Of Pain,"Regardless of its excellent features, the buttons on this watch are tiny. Don't let the photo fool you - those four protrusions are just big knobs that house four pinhead-sized buttons that take great force to push, and are VERY painful to use. Why nobody seems to mention this problem in their reviews of this watch is a mystery to me. I have read some reviews of other timex watches, even ones with large buttons, that complain of this problem. One reviewer said of the Timex Expedition Trail Series watch ""maybe one is supposed to put the watch in a vise and then use a screwdriver to push the buttons."" And that watch has very large buttons.My fingers are not particularly sensitive and I have a very high tolerance for pain, so I can only figure everyone else is using thimbles or something to set their watches.No more Timex for me - back to Casio."
4,Nice basic do-it-all watch. Good price.,"This is a nice, basic do-it-all watch. Easy to read. I like the low profile on my wrist. I wish it where less ""mechanical"" looking, but I guess there are always other options. It's not too big or too small. Good price."
3,Huge but seems to work good.,"This item seems to work just great, but I didn't expect it to be so HUGE. It's a least a foot long and takes up a lot of space in the drawer... just not quite sure why it needs to be so big... Works totally great though, would have rated it about a 3.5 just based on it's unexpected size (probably my own fault)."
4,Better safe...,"Good product is improved from its older, smaller version. Works especially well when you really aren't sure if the meat is done."
1,hate it,I hate this thing I dont know when the meat is done because I dont know what temperature to take it off the fire mine only shows temperature the one I had before showed rare med and well done and I could understand that maybe if I had a chart that showed what the temperatures meant I would like this reddi chek
4,Trusty Thermometer -- kinda cheeky,"This thermometer has been very accurate for the wide variety of uses to which I've subjected it so far. This includes not only meats (we're talking steak, hotdogs, salmon, chicken, any kind of meat) but leftovers I microwaved (curiosity) water for proofing yeast (I never followed that part of the recipe before) and even bathwater (again, curiosity.)I gave this thermometer 4 stars instead of 5 because it is very sensitive. Or maybe it is afraid of the dark. You see, I keep it in a drawer. It really, *really* seems to like being used because every time I open that drawer something bumps against it and I hear the little chirp of my thermometer turning on.Also, one time I heard a very quiet high-pitched sound and it was the thermometer which was on. I had trouble figuring it out at first, but the sound was so persistent that I finally figured it out. So now I am paranoid when I open the drawer and hear the chirp, that it will stay on and make that noise again."
4,Quick & Accurate,"I got this instant-read thermometer primarily to check internal temp of artisinal breads, but it soon replaced my meat thermometer. It is so quick and, in side-by-side test with my trusty old dial thermometer, it was very accurate. My only issue with it is that it sometimes - not always - wants to read the room temperature for an extended time. That means that I have to remove the battery when storing it in order to save battery life. Minor inconvenience, but it would rate five stars otherwise."
2,Maverick Pro Thermometer - Lukewarm,"Much larger than picture led me to believe, a bit bulky. Tip is too large to be fast responding. Meat is consistently overcooked."
2,Not Pleased,"As pointed out in some of the other reviews, this thermometer has a very large copper tip that makes it difficult to check the doneness of thin cuts of meat. Also, I used the thermometer to check the doneness of some baked chicken breasts. It worked fine, but when eating the chicken at the point where the probe entered the meat, I detected a distinct metallic taste. (This was after washing the tip thoroughly with soap before use.) Although I like the digital temperature readout of this product, as far as I'm concerned, it's DONE. I have since purchased a different thermometer with a stainless-steel tip, and am very happy with it."
4,A delightful addition to my ever-expanding library,"of obscure folk groups. While I do not give this collection the five stars rendered by all of the other reviewers of this title, it is still a wonderful assemblage of both traditional and contemporary folk music, and offers the listener an opportunity to experience the pure and powerful sound of a young Cass Elliot. The voices of her two partners, Tim Rose and Jim Hendricks, are passable as compared with other folk groups of the time, but it is Elliot's lovely strains that ultimately carry the trio.I purchased this title from Amazon.com more out of curiosity than out of an old memory of having ever heard the group. I simply wanted to hear what Mama Cass had to offer prior to the inception of The Mamas And The Papas; and I am not disappointed that I did.If you're interested in pursuing the overall history of the '60s folk revival, the liner notes are extremely informational, and are worth the price of the CD alone."
4,They are all there.,"Back in the late 1960s, I discovered the two albums by the Big Three in the cut-out bins of the old Arlen's stores. As a big fan of folk music, and of the Mamas and Papas, the decision to buy the albums was easy. I wasn't prepared for how much I actually loved them. The voices blend beautifully in excellent harmony. Anyone who is a fan of Cass Elliott will have to add this CD to their collection. My old albums on FM are all mono, so hearing these songs in great stereo was also a treat, and all the songs on those two LPs are included on this excellent sounding CD. I will be playing this one a lot."
5,A must read -- for everyone,"If you want the unbiased truth about cannabis (marijuana) compiled from reputable sources without alterior motives, this is the book to buy.A committee of Canadian Senators spent two years going over existing research and interviewing hundreds of experts in every aspect of the subject, coming to the conclusion that cannabis should be legalized and regulated much like alcohol.This book is an easy to read abridged version (aprox 200 pages) of the original 600+ page report (which is available online in .PDF format).While researchers should acquire the original report, I recommend that anyone at all interested should purchase the abridged version, and maybe also buy one for a friend.A very enlightening read."
2,Empty,"I had to work to finish this book since I wasn't interested in the main character at all. Her circumstances were too unique for anyone to relate to and she was completely cynical and detached from everything.The girl was disengaged and STILL managed to make snarky remarks about people and places. Wow, THAT makes me want to like her.I've been depressed so I can say that other depressed people aren't that interesting. What we're looking for is the spark between people - if that doesn't exist, what's the point? There isn't one, this book seem to say.Well thank God it ended and ended the way it did.I'm a guy, by the way (if that makes any difference)."
3,It was O.K.,"I'm not understanding why this book is getting the rave reviews it is. ""Red Panda"" has a lot of unanswered questions, alot of plot holes, and not a ton of substance. Stella, to me, is not a fully developed charachter; I never understood her motivations. I'm tired of chick lit too, but this book is not the answer to it. The author is good, hopefully her next book she will be better. I just cannot rave about this book...too bland and dry for my liking. It is an easy read, so that's why I gave the book three stars. I got through it in a few days, and it was an O.K. book."
1,Kill Me Now,"I was half way through this book when I realized how much it was draining and depressing me. There are no redeeming qualities in any of the characters; they all seem to be disassociated, inept or flawed in some way. This bright young girl has NO ONE that she can count on to help her and it's awful and sad. The only thing I got out of this book was that it made me glad that 1) I am no longer a teenager and 2) I don't HAVE any teenagers. Is this how they really are nowadays?? I knew that I would be upset with the ending since she would either not kill herself or kill herself. I couldn't bear to read anymore, so I skipped to the ending and yes, I was upset. This is an awful book."
2,Only passable,"It's a difficult thing to spend 280 pages inside a character's head and still find them dull, but that's the experience of this book. In the hands of a better writer, this attempted revision of Catcher might have been good, maybe even in the hands of this writer five years from now it will be good, but as it stands, I was underwhelmed.The characterization is sketchy, the observations unilluminative, and the point missing. There are better examples of this story out there, and I found myself resentful that I had forced myself to finish the entire thing."
4,great book,"This book is very difficult to describe. Because it's in journal format, Stella's mind wanders in several directions and she writes it all down. It's hard to keep up with what's actually going in the story. I had to stop and re-read serveral pages. I'm actually going to re-read the whole book just in case I missed something.On the plus side, the character development is superb. You can actually feel what Stella is feeling. You understand her reactions and her sarcastic comments. She is troubled and slowly the author takes you deeper and deeper into her troubled mind.You will find yourself asking ""what is she (Stella) talking about?"" You have to think about it hard in order for it to make sense."
5,not for everyone,"but hey, what is?I just finished this book an hour ago. The last time I read a book was 3 years ago, but that was only for my English class. I've attempted to read various books since then, but have gotten bored with all of them before getting to the third chapter.""Like the Red Panda"" was EXACTLY what I needed at this time in my life.I recommend it to anyone who has ever thought about suicide (not neccessarily as something to do, just something to think about) and those of us who are humored and at the same time bothered daily by the transparency of this world and the people in it.I thoroughly enjoyed this book in every way. The structure was easy to understand but not boring, and the detailed character description affected me the most.Anyway, this is my first book review and it probably didn't say much, but this is a smart book and smart people will enjoy it. :)"
4,More than just chewing gum for the eyes.,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, which may have to do with the fact that I easily related to the novel's main character, Stella. Not necessarily in her suicidal tendencies, but more in her innate way of examining and picking up on the subtle nuances of the people and things around her. Hyper-observant and constantly finding irony in everyday life, her character was an intriguing one for me.However, I can see where some readers may have become bored and uninterested with her character, as she is truly unique and may not speak to those who cannot relate to her situation. Alienated from the absurdities of high school, suburbia, and humanity itself, she finds herself without passion for anything, though she hints at wanting to feel passion.This book is not for everyone, but I recommend it to those who want to see through the eyes of a character not often recognized in literature."
4,Celebration,This is a good CD. I acutally purchased it for one songe but as I listened there are others that I enjoy.
3,"Good Quality, Too thick for normal pillowcases","I am having a real difficult time adjusting to this pillow. I've slept strictly on down pillows for years but this is the first time I tried a gusseted pillow. It seem that the extra thickness results in a pillow that is too big for a normal pillow case. This makes it hard to get the pillow in the case but, more importantly, makes the pillow puff up to where it's like a foot high and way too firm. It hurts my neck to lay on it.I looked for oversized pillow cases but I could only ones that are longer (not wider). If I sleep on it with NO pillow case it seems fine but that's not a real good option. My wife finally decided to buy some bed sheets and make some oversized pillow cases. Unfortunately, she went too cheap on the sheets so they are rougher than a normal pillow case. I just can't win with this one.All the same, I gave it three stars because it seems to be quality made."
1,BOOTY,"I know this jaycat. His first Silent Cries was the tightest, but this album is a bunch of crap. This should have never come out"
5,Krups Theraml Carafe,"I thought the hype from Consumer's Reports was just that. After buying and using for these several weeks I can tell you it is the best coffee maker my wife and I ever owned. No more burned taste, or if one or the other sleeps late the coffee is still as fresh as when brewed. Spend a little extra and get the Rolls Royce of coffemakers (Krups)."
1,It's a leaker!,"After my old Krups bit the dust after 10 years of perfect service, I ordered and received my new Krups model 229. I followed the directions to run water through without coffee to remove possible sediment from the factory. I filled the machine to the 8 cup mark and and water leaked from the bottom of the machine all over the counter. I tried again, this time in the sink, and the same thing happened. I immediately re-packed the machine and sent it back. It is a nice looking machine and would try it again once all the flaws are fixed."
3,Good Coffee Maker For Small/Mild Batches,"I like good quality, strong coffee. I generally drink either Peet's or Starbucks' stronger blends. This Krups model is marked in five 5oz. cups. The standard for regular (strong) coffee is one two-tablespoon scoop per cup. For a seven-cup batch, that means seven fulls scoops of coffee.In my experience, the basket design and the ""Aroma Control"" feature of this machine are such that, with a large volume of coffee grounds, the machine does not do a good job of extraction, and the result is less flavor in the final result.I also agree with the comments of some others regarding the plastic tab/metal catch design of the basket closure. If the plastic tab fails or is not fully engaged, the liquid in the basket will not flow into the thermos and can backup and overflow the basket.This is a quality machine, but it needs some improvements for those of us who like strong coffee and who also occasionally like to make large (six-plus) batches of it."
1,I usually only buy Krups...but this was terrible,"I had thought I had gotten a really good deal on this in the department store at the time I purchased this, but it was nothing but trouble...Pieces kept falling off, and when a part detached that I couldnt get back on, we realized that it actually worked better without it. It lasted aout 4 months, at which point the coffee wasn't dripping down into the carafe and began overflowing.....We have the Krups Cappuccino maker and we have had Krups coffeemakers in the past,and always swore by them but I would never buy this model again"
1,Don't buy it,Water backs up in the filter basket and doesn't drain into the carafe. Resulting coffee is not worth the trouble of cleaning up the mess.
2,Has problems-buy something else,"I've owned and used this machine for over a year. Sometimes the coffee is really good but sometimes it comes out really weak. If you don't set the carafe in just right, the pause-and-serve feature stops the coffee from flowing into the carafe and it overflows the filter instead. The result is coffee all over the counter, floor, etc. It has ruined my wood floor!!! I am always careful when I put the carafe in, but it happened anyway. Last night I brewed a pot of coffee and it came out tasting terrible. I'm done with this coffee maker, buying a new one today..maybe the braun."
1,Worst Coffee Maker for All The Hype,"I am an absolute cofee connouiser, and after 30 years of cofee making and coffee drinking, this is the WORST COFFEE MAKER I have ever owned. I had a nice Braun FlavorSelect maker in which you could adjust the temperature of the heat plate to keep coffee warm. But the Braun carafes kept breaking, so thought I'd try something new.Thought this thermal model would keep it warm. NOT!!! Awful coffee maker for the high price. Sure it looks nice (I was taken in by the steel finish), but in every other aspect it [is not good]. No water filter, coffee is cold (even when i pre-heat the carafe with hot water). And finally, after 1 month, the carafe handle came unlodged and the screw is rattling inside the outer shell of the carafe.I just bought the Cuisinart steel model, and it is great. Hot coffee, retro good looks, so many nice features, and a great carafe..."
2,"Good idea, poorly executed","A thermal carafe is a nice idea because it keeps the coffee hot without scorching it. But...(1) As others have reported, the handle does indeed come loose over time (about six months) and there seems to be no way to fix it. This is just inexcusable.(2) The timer feature would be a lot more useful if the clock did not reset itself randomly. It seems to be highly sensitive to power spikes, which cause the time *and* the programmed start time to reset. Too often this makes the coffeemaker start itself in the middle of the night instead of the morning, so you get a pot of 8-hour old coffee the next day.(3) The coffee drains through a complicated lid that you cannot really clean. I doubt the carafe will last much longer (the handle seems about ready to fall off completely) but if it did, accumulated gunk inside the lid would get pretty nasty over time."
3,Krups AromaControl Coffee Maker,"It looks beautiful but falls way short of my expectations. Carafe handle loosened within 2 months, am now awaiting a back order of carafes from Krups. Sometimes the coffee does not empty into the carafe even though lid is on correctly. Difficult to pour, many times the coffee spills around the mug."
3,"Sleek Machine, Good Brew but Overrated","The machine is aesthetically pleasing, the coffee brews in minutes as touted. BUT, the coffee is not brewed as hot as it should be, and the carafe does NOT keep the coffee hot. Within an hour, the coffee is lukewarm. You can do better for less money."
4,Good Coffee Maker,"I have one of these at home. It works very well. I can set it up to make coffee at night and it is ready for me in the morning. Two little things I don't like are the caraffe and the brewer. First, you need to turn the caraffe for it to pour where as my other one you did not. Second, it is a little difficult to remove the caraffe from the brewer. Overall this is a very good coffee maker. You will be glad you bought it."
2,Krups 229 A Big Disapointment!,"This Krups is terrible! I thought this would be a great coffee maker given it's price ... I have owned this for 2 weeks, so far my ...special (Mr Coffee) in my opinion, makes better hotter coffee,and with less mess. This 229 model looks nice but,it does not have a removable water resevoir, the fill area is small and hard to fill without spilling. The carafe spills when pouring due to no pour spout,and you cannot pour a even steady stream. And the worst thing is, this machine does not produce HOT coffee."
2,Carafe exploded,"We've had this coffeemaker for about 10 months now and so far it has worked reasonably well. I have to admit that the coffee is not as hot as I would like it though, when brewed. However what is more upsetting is that the carafe exploded on me today after it had been washed. We are very careful with the carafe and always handwash and take good care of it. Is there a replacement carafe? Can Krups replace this?Regards,Kavitha"
2,Almost a keeper.,"One the plus side, this is a beautiful machine. It's fit andfinish are exceptional. I will return it to the dealer becausethe finished coffee, though good, is not nearly hot enough and the pouring lip has no contour to aid in pouring."
1,"Great coffee, shoddy materials and poor design","This product makes great coffee but it's made of flimsy plastic, the base of which isn't strong enough to support the top-heavy machine. The simple action of placing and removing the thermal carafe strains the flimsy base; let the base rest on the cord, resulting in less-than-solid footing for the machine, and the base is guaranteed to crack in short order. Its good looks don't last long, either, because the materials are so desperately inferior. I've owned Krups coffeemakers for more than 20 years, but they've lost a loyal customer. I wouldn't buy another one these for $29.95 ... or any other price. This is junk!"
3,Flunks on Several Counts,"I plan to return my Krups Thermal CM. Problems for me:1. too tall, will not fit under standard kitchen cabinets .. about 0.5 inches too tall!2. No Spout. The carafe pours too wide and in bunches, will miss your cup if not careful. Why not a spout!!3. No base heater. Carafe may keep warm, but a base heater would help.4. Plastic is cheap and top fits poorly."
2,Leaks water all over my counter top,"I will never buy a Krups product again. Especially considering the money I paid for it. You evidently don't get what you pay for anymore. When I pour water into the unit, 1/4 of it leaks from under the unit onto my countertop, down the cabinet and all over my floor. When I called Krups, they said it would be 3-4 months because of the backlog of repairs (not surprising).The basket needs to be cleaned often or it backs up and doesn't drip through to the pot."
4,Trouble with Switch,"I love my Krups Coffee Maker, the coffee stays fresh for hours, stays warm for a long period of time. My only complaint is that the start button is wearing out already. Is doesn't always brew, which causes frustration. It takes multiple times of me going back and pushing the switch to finally get it to brew. Other than that one mechanical problem, I do love the coffee it brews!"
1,Poor Quality Carafe,The handle on the carafe loosens very quickly and becomes impossible to tighten. I have purchased 3 additional carafes and ALL of them have had the same problem. Krups does not warrant the carafe.
1,Reservoir leaks on the counter...bad design,"Brought it home from the store and in great excitement took it from the box and prepared it for first use. Poured in the cold water, and the water immediately ran out of the bottom all over the counter. As it is a 60 mile drive back to the retailer I disassembled the device looking for a loose tube connection or something fixable. Nope, it is a design problem. The bottom of the reservoir has two molded sockets that accept screws from the base assembly. The reservoir bottom is so thin that the assembly technician tightining the screw on the right hand side fractured the bottom of the reservoir. The plastic is so thin that I expect a leak via this mechanism would happen frequently. I imagine this is the source of all the mystery leaking reported in earlier reviews. Can make no comment on the taste of the coffee as mine was dead on arrival. Now to figure out how to exchange the thing without a 120 mile round trip."
2,It's not great,"I am disappointed in this product. I have a hard time pouring with out spilling coffee. It has a ""wide pour"" I frequently spill. The carafe just does not keep the coffee warm for any amount of time. I had an old inexpensive carafe(I really wanted to to get rid of it) the old one kept coffe hot-warm for a day or two. Why can't this do the same...I am generally disappointed with this, and feel I definately paid way too much for it."
2,Not happy with the Krups Aroma Control Coffeemaker,"I agree with the many other reviewers who negatively reviewed this item. The coffee does not stay hot unless you charge the carafe with hot water and remove it immediately from the brewer when finished, both of which are too much to do just to make coffee. As with others, I have to microwave coffee that isn't immediately poured into a cup when brewing is finished. The coffee is weak because of the poor design of the basket, which causes hot water to flow through the middle and not seep in the coffee toward the edges. Finally, the automatic shutoff stopped working 14 months after purchase. I shipped the brewer to Krups in New Jersey several weeks ago to repair under an extended warranty and still don't have it back. The next time this thing breaks, I am going to trash it and buy another brand."
5,Great coffee maker,I have two Krups Aroma Control makers and love them both. I have 4 total carafes and one of them has a broken handle after 5 years. If anyone that still has the pot that is not using the machine and wants to sell just the handle let me know. If the price is right I will take two just in case I need another one in 5 years! Thanks
1,"Breaks Quickly, Don't Buy","I can't urge you enough not to buy this coffee maker. The ""steeping feature"" in the filter basket fails after about two months, forcing you to physically dismantle the basket each time (with hot coffee) to get the machine to eject the coffee. Krups does NOT make good on its warranty, instead making excuses why the filter basket doesn't work. I had been a happy Krups customer for the last twenty years, but I will be no longer."
2,Horrible Handle,"I have purchased two (2) of these coffee pots, love the sleek stainless style of the coffee pot. However, BOTH handles on the pots began getting loose and I'm afraid it will break altogether.I feel for the money spent they are not worth it. Or is there a way to fix them and what causes this? Thank You."
2,Disappointed in Krups 10 cup Aroma Control,After having spent a lot of money on this coffeemaker I am thoroughly unhappy with it. The swing out basket is difficult to pull out and is constructed of very [inexpensive] plastic. I am afraid if I tug at it too hard it will break. The lid on the carafe doesn't twist on easily. Sometimes I have to do it several times before it's on securely and evenly. Pouring from the carafe is messy at times since there is no lip for this function. I also have to run hot water into the carafe for a while before brewing so that the coffee will be hotter. My old Mr. Coffee for a lot less money made better coffee.
2,Krupp 10 Cup coffee maker,We bought this coffeemaker and had it about a month. If you don't remove the pot from the maker after it is done brewing it gets cold fairly quickly. The top collects old coffee and is hard to clean as the coffee runs through the screw on top. The top also pours coffee pourly. For $... coffee maker I would expect the design to be better. We are sending ours back now because the timer/on-off switch stopped working.
4,Good speakers,"Nice and compact. Well designed for portability. Fills up a room well however is not very loud at its highest volume. Distortion lowers the speakers ability to allow high volumes however still quite good. Very good little speaker and ever charge the ipod. Not to mention, has a remote, and runs on ac chord or battery powered. RECOMENDED"
5,Looks Great! Sounds Great! Loads of Features!,"I bought this for my office based on reviews from iLounge. I love it! Not only does it look cool, it's very compact and streamlined with a nice sound. The remote does stuff that you wouldn't expect like scrolling through albums, playlists, repeat, shuffle, plus the standard volume and play/pause and previous/next. It folds flat for travel or storage and have a very small footprint. The sound has a nice range and sounds bigger than it is. I have a Bose SoundDock at home and although this product isn't as robust in sound quality, it has way more features for a fraction of the cost. If I didn't already have a Bose SoundDock at home, I would have been satisfied with the iStation7 at home and at the office."
1,"Good idea, poor quality","I purchased this to listen to in an office setting, and was dissatisfied after an hour of use. I tested the iStation7 at every volume level, and literally every 5 minutes the iStation7 would stop playing; the system was still on, and the iPod continued to play, there was just no sound. I would have to manually pause the iPod and then press play for the the sound to resume. The look of it is nice, and the remote control helps, but constantly having to pause and replay the iPod for the system to work for five minutes is completely unacceptable."
5,Lovely music by a superb Spanish mezzo,"This collection is pretty much the same as the collection of zarzuela arias on the Ensayo recording Zarzuela Recital: Teresa Berganza. It's fascinating and beautiful. Try it or the other recording to experience the magic of zarzuela, the Spanish cousin of Viennese operetta.See my review there."
5,Fabulous reading!,"Essential in understanding the 17th century in Antigua Guatemala, this is great reading. Written by a Dominican monk, it takes us back in time to colonial times!"
2,Kay Lenz!!!!...,"PRISONERS OF THE LOST UNIVERSE is pretty goofy. Kay Lenz is a TV personality who goes to the home of a scientist for an interview. On the way there, she runs a poor guy named Dan (Richard Hatch) off the road. They part company and Kay gets to the house, where the scientist has invented a gateway to a parrallel universe in his lab (!!). You can guess the rest, as Kay, the scientist, and Dan all accidentally exit this universe and enter the wonky one! John Saxon is a sadistic warlord named Kleel who wants total domination. Anyway, there are bug-eyed natives, a caveman, a green dude, and lots of Ms. Lenz running around in peril! If it weren't for her, I'd have fallen asleep sooner than I did. If you enjoy huge gobs of cheese, then this is worth a peek..."
3,wow !,IF YOUR IN TO D&D FANTACY ADVENTURE YOU WILL LOVE THIS ! HAVING SEEN IT IN ITS ENTIRETY BACK IN THE 80'S WHEN IT AIRED I CAN TELL YOU THAT SOME HAS BEEN EDITED OUT BUT THAY DID'NT HURT THE STORY LINE AT ALL. AND WHAT A STORY !FAST PACED LOT'S OF ACTION AND VERMIN RIGHT OUT OF THE D&D MONSTER MANUAL ! A MUST SEE FOR DUNGON MASTER'S AND PLAYERS ALIKE !
5,"Great to work with, will buy again","Received drum and it was defective. They shipped another drum to replace it and emailed a shipping tag. They were great to work with and were prompt in shipping. When called on the defective drum the person was effecient, friendly, and prompt in getting a shipping tag emailed for sending back. I highly recommend this company for their products because they stand behind it and know your needs are great so they ship according to your needs."
2,Call Me Stupid,"I am not sure how well this product, the drum, works. It came in a generic box with no instructions. I saw one tab that said remove. I did not see the second one. I put the drum in my machine and Voila the whole MFC Printer went boom and subsequently damaged the gears on my HP 2840 toner cartridge carrier. The toner cartridges no longer connect with the machine (I have adjusted the carrier but the gears are stripped and so the carrier keeps popping out of place). This was an expensive lesson as I am now looking to use the drum in a replacement. Really dumb is doing the same thing twice and expecting a different result."
1,Horrible quality after less than 1 ream of paper!,"Had been buying HP branded fuser/drums for past 4 years with my printer and never had an issue, tried this aftermarket alternative because it was 1/6th the price of HP brand. What a mistake! Printer didnt like it when installed but got it to be fine. Seemed to print ""ok"" at the beginning but images not crisp, text even a bit fuzzy then after less than a ream of paper (500 sheets) it started putting a line down left of center on the page. After using it less than 6 weeks went and ordered a genuine HP drum for $185 and it prints great again. I $32 experiment gone wrong with the Eagle Brand Toner!"
4,it works,"the reviews were mixed on this product, but for the price I decided to try it. It is compatible and it works but it prints really light."
1,2nd resurection,"I am very disappointed that I can't get the 2nd resurection on cd. Will it ever become a cd? My mother use to play that album all the time when I was a little girl, and I loved it. I never heard of them before that. I was so happy to see a review about it. Now I guess I'll have to go find that old album of hers and tape it. That is, if the record player still works. LOL"
4,Nice little gadget,"I bought this for my Sharp Zaurus. Works great; doesn't need a driver installed; doesn't block the stylus or the headphone jack; gives pretty decent performance. Only real problem is a bug in the standard, not the device: WEP is about as effective as hanging a ""please do not steal"" sign on the Hope Diamond before leaving it on a bench in Central Park. If you're going to set up any kind of wireless LAN, get yourself a VPN--I'm running PPP over SSH, and I'm fairly confident nobody's going to break into my LAN or hijack my external link."
2,Doesn't Work with Netgear Wireless Router,"I purchased this CF Wi-Fi card for my Dell Axim X5 400Mhz and was unable to get it to connect to my Netgear router. I tried the drivers that came with the disk and could not get it to work. I then downloaded the updated drivers from D-Link and still could not get it to connect. Spoke with Level 3 support from D-Link and they said to try exchanging the Compact Flash card for a new one. Amazon did this for me without hesitation and had a new D-Link CF card to me within 2 days. Unfortunately, the new card would still not connect. I then purchased the Ambicom CF Wireless Card. It installed and worked perfectly immediately. Unless you have a D-Link Wi-Fi router, you should consider purchasing with caution."
3,good for handheld pc only at this time,"I love this unit, good quality and better reception than the dcf-650w. The unit works in my compaq ipaq with the 650 drivers so you can get signal strength by downloading these. The only problem and the reason why I returned it and stayed with the 650 with the dcf-654 cf-pc adapter is there are no drivers for my windows 2000 laptop."
4,Power Pop Excellence,"I too had trouble pigeonholing the style at the time it was released, but now I know that it fits comfortably in the Power Pop genre, with a large debt to ELO as mentioned by another reviewer. It's not innovative, but Stephen Crumbacher sure knew how to write the hooks and wrap them up in thick layers of keyboardy goodness."
5,Great Episodes,"Just have to say that all the episodes are wonderful in Tenchi Universe. It is my favorite series because of it's so hilarious. Even though these are filler episodes, they can tell you about some of the characters."
5,vga male to male,it is a vga male to male it works great . i used it with my computer converter box to hook up to tv . it works great . it has 2 screews to atach it to what ever or you can take them all the way out i had to to get it to plug in to my computer to converter elemenating the wires to it . the only down on it is the plug that goes in make one object upside down with my box it didnt matter . i wouldnt find even the wired kind where i live so i had to order it and this was a great price . thanking about ordering more for back up .
4,Very funny!,"A light hearted movie with a moral.......... "" don't judge a book by it's cover "". John Candy was perfect as "" Uncle Buck ""."
4,Every family has an Uncle Buck don't they?,"This is funny stuff. I've heard some critics bag this because of it's shallow silliness but that's what gives Candy his laughs.John Candy belongs in movies like this. ""Summer Rental"" and ""The great Outdoors"" are others where his comedy rocks. I think directors know Candy's talents shine where family issues with kids are involved. Uncle Buck is John Candy's best film. I love his no shockers bouncing car with an on time BANG upon stopping.Heartfelt moments melded with great laughs make this essential to all Candy fans"
4,Wonderful Movie :),I got My DVD in the mail today and just as I remember the movie is great. It was used so a little finger prints was on the disc but washed off easily and plays good :) love it!!!!
5,"Ever hear of a ritual killing? Ah, heh heh heh heh heh","John Candy at his best,This is a classic comedy great for the family.Bug, hatchet, bowling, 1981 Ford LTD scene, uptight in-laws, the jealous fiancé, a death in the family brings everyone together, or possibly rips them apart.Bug: Ever hear of a tune-up? Hee hee hee hee hee.Buck: Ah, heh heh heh. Ever hear of a ritual killing? Ah, heh heh heh heh hehBug: I don't get it.Buck: You gnaw on her face in public like that again and you'll be one. Ah, heh heh heh heh!"
4,An almost perfect classic!,"I would have given it 5 stars because it is a true must have classic, but it loses a star because I'm sick of Blu rays with no surround sound, only 1 or 2 channels is crap for high def releases (Yes both National Lampoons Vacations come to mind) even though it is 2.0 HD it sounds OK just not quite 5 stars."
2,Uncle Buck,Uncle Buck is a funny movie but it has way too much drama and bad language! I enjoy a good clean movie!
3,gerat john candy movie,what about uncle buck? One of the later comedies with John Candy. Family fun classic and a comedy.
5,Love Candy,And John Candy too. Who doesn't love John Candy. So sad that he is gone. He is great in this movie as Uncle Buck. This is a funny movie with a nice story for parents and kids alike. Buy it you'll enjoy it. Can't miss.
4,The importance of being an uncle,"This movie seems frivolous on the surface, but I consider it a very significant statement about how important the role of an uncle (or aunt) in the life of a child can be. It is an object lesson, both for parents and uncles/aunts on the influence of extended family for good or ill. It also happens to star one of my all-time favorite performers, the late John Candy, in one the hilarious and heart-tugging roles for which I think he is best remembered.The only reason I gave this film 4 stars instead of 5 is because of what i consider excessive use of profanity. Some of it is actually appropriate and even clever in the way it's handled with the younger children. But a lot of it is just annoying and makes the writers seem unimaginative.Still, I highly recommend this film."
4,A Great Family Comedy,"Not as funny as Planes, Trains and Automobiles, but our kids love this comedy. It is a must have for your John Candy collection."
5,Uncle Buck,"My order of the DVD ""Uncle Buck"" was my first order through Amazon.com and I was very satisfied with the order. The DVD was in perfect condition, and it was delivered promptly. I actually received it in the mail sooner than I expected."
3,"A solid return for John Candy after two stale efforts; Who's Harry Crumb?, and Speed Zone...",Somewhat inspiring and hilarious mostlystory of older batchelor bro. who has towatch his younger bros. kids after wife'sfather has heart attach. See Mac Culkinin here before Home Alone. Gaby Hoffmanalmost steals the show!
4,"""Who are you?... I'm your Uncle Buck!""","One of Candy's two best roles - the other was in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" and both of these John Hughes films have a similar bittersweet tone.The film lacks the more emotionally touching elements of PTA but has plenty of one-liners and slapstick to keep it bubbling along. One funny example - Candy: ""I stopped smoking cigarettes. I'm on a five year plan. I go first to cigars, then a pipe, then chewing tobacco, then that nicotine gum."" The hostility against the older nieces boyfriend is a bit excessive for the young audience the movie was designed for, but there are many elements they should love - Buck's pancake breakfasts, his steaming car and the modern clothes washing techniques. What works for adults in this film is the casual approach with which clever lines are dispensed - ""The dog drinks water?..Good, I've been leaving the toilet seats up."" Well-cast, with a nice cameo from ""Roseanne's"" Laurie Metcalf as the tarty neighbour."
4,"""Great John Candy Film!""","John Candy and Amy Madigan star in this 1989 John Hughes comedy.A man is asked to watch is nieces and nephew during a family crisis.This is a great film and one of my favorites with John. This dvd hasdecent picture and sound, but no extras. I recommend this."
5,Classic Candy!,"I have always loved John Candy's movies, but this one was by far his best work. Just a total campy, goofy, feel-good movie that you can watch over and over. My 5 year old daughter thinks he's the coolest!"
5,Love this movie,I love this move - John Candy is perfect with these kids. Fun to watch anytime you have a few hours.
2,John Hughes's worst film.,"Uncle Buck starring John Candy is boring, flat, and unfunny. I find it hard to believe that the late John Hughes wrote this depressing '80s flick. Macaulay Culkin is pretty good in this, he would later star in the Home Alone movies also written by Hughes. Uncle Buck tries to be a light-hearted comedy/drama but I can't seem to find anything special about this stinker. Candy's acting is awesome but even his delightful face can't save this silly farce. Stick to The Breakfast Club or National Lampoon's Vacation if you want a flawless Hughes movie."
2,Ridiculous Comedy That is Not Family Friendly,"This movie is way over the top in stupidy. Sure there are a few laughable moments, but for the most part things are ridiculous. Which makes for a very unfunny movie altogether. Our family didn't even watch it to the end - and we love comedies. Why is it that huge, overweight men in movies always have a svelte girlfriend? Shouldn't the girlfriend be a ""plus size"" as well? That's right - the majority of men don't like big. I forgot.If you like listening to little kids use vulgarity every other sentance, then this is the movie for you and your family. If watching a 15 year old girl get laid is your kind of entertainment, then this is the show for you and your family.In today's world with the current rating system, this movie would get a PG-13 rating at best. R wouldn't be too far behind.To his credit however, ""Uncle Buck"" makes everything right in a family that was wrong."
2,Fun Family Movie,"The movie is fine, but...............There is no mention in the description that this is a widescreen format. I use full screen. When I contacted amazon to find if it was available in full screen, the response was send it back if you don't want it. I kept it, but was not happy with customer service."
1,Silly and Stupid,"Family movies are supposed to be fun. This movie is far from it. I never liked John Candy movies, or what I saw of them. This is the stupidest of them all. With a goofy plot, a stupid script, and horrible acting, this is a movie I wish I missed. True, it has some heart, some wit, but it's all washed away in a garble of trashy scenes, mixed up dialogue, and foolish one-liners. Not only that,the music is horrible. John Candy says something creepy, and suddenly there is this creepy sounding mesh of music--noise--that makes me want to cover my ears. It would be better off with no music--in fact, it would be better off if it didn't exist."
4,Good but no commentary,"Uncle Buck is a great movie and it looks great in Blu-Ray, but its short on special features. No commentary!"
5,Good old fashioned fun and morals!!,Uncle Buck. John Candy. Family fun and entertainment that doesn't contain profanity with every other word. How fantastic!! Loved it way back when and appreciate it even more now!!
3,not Candy's best flick but funny in some parts,"This movie wasn't exactly what I thought it would be but John Candy did just as good as Spaceballs. It's not as funny as Planes,Trains,& Automobiles but see it at least once."
4,Uncle Buck(1989)****JOHN CANDY IS THE MAN!!,"Ahh, the great comedy ""Uncle Buck"", staring the great John Candy.This a great comedy for the family. When Buck's brother in Chicago suddenly calls him to watch out for there kids while they are away because his wife's father has been having some heart problems, he kindly accepts(even though the family is not crazy about him in the first place becaus he is a slob and an embarasment).When he gets there, he has to deal with these three kids who where alot crazier than he had planned.But he most trouble he has is with the oldest, who completely hates him. But in end the they gain a mutual respect for each other, and Buck is now respected by the family. DEFINETLY SEE THIS MOVIEGood scene:1 When Buck makes giant pancakes and toast for his nephews birthday2 When Buck completely shuts down his neices principle"
4,Great family movie,Uncle Buck has become a family favorite in our house. John Candy is terrific and Jean Louisa Kelly gives a great performance as a sullen teenager unhappy with her folks and their decision to move to a new town. This is a definite movie to own and watch with your children. My only complaint is that the audio is only two tracks (vs 5.1). It would've received 5 stars otherwise.
4,Silly but hilarious.,"This is classic John Candy before the mush. Uncle Buck has the rare mixture of warmth and edge to it. He is the ultimate lovable loser, who enjoys his life. Macully Caulkin is a riot much like watching Home Alone for the first time. The Q&A between Caulkin and Candy is hilarious as anyone with kids can attest to. The antagonistic relationship with the oldest daughter and her ""boyfriend"" is a great. Uncle Buck is recommended for any night where light-hearted silliness is needed."
4,I just love Uncle Buck!,"Of all the movies John Candy made, this is my all-time favorite!! By the time the movie was finished, I found myself so wishing I had an Uncle Buck of my very own! John Candy is so super as Uncle Buck, and so totally priceless! I re-watch this movie whenever I just want to have fun witnessing how poor, hapless Uncle Buck manages to win the hearts of his nieces and nephew, through just being his wonderful, lovable--and, very protective of them--self! This is truly a great heart-warmer of a movie!"
5,Uncle Buck,"Uncle Buck is a great movie, a comedy which shouldn't be missed. Even if there are some sad moments, they're cheered up with some comedy. Parents: the characters cuss a lot so take caution while your young kids are watching it."
3,Rita has style,"Rita Rudner makes you feel like she is just too ladylike for comedy...but she pulls it off! Joy Behar was o.k. but not as good as Rita. Worth buying just to see how Joy got that job on ""The View""!"
5,Works great with pfSense 2,"I decided to turn an old laptop into a router using pfSense since I needed IPSec VPN capabilities for work and I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a new router with this capability. Like most laptops, it only has one Ethernet port, so I decided to buy an adapter to add another port. After plugging in the adapter and installing pfSense 1.2.3, for some reason I could only get 50mbps down even though I could get 100 up. I upgraded to pfSense version 2-RC3 and it seemed to use a new driver for the adapter and now I can get the full 100 up and down. So overall I'm very pleased that it worked for what I wanted, and I'm glad the latest pfSense had a good driver for the adapter that allows me to use it at full speed."
1,DUB-E100 REVIEW,"The unit shipped to me did not function with the software loaded on the disc included. After many hours with tech support they concluded it was non-functional. I kept getting a hardware problem notice every time I connected it to 2 computers I have, both gave the same identical error using windows xp business edition. After much delay I finally got an rma number from their support department but they only refunded about half of the money they charged me. I recommend staying away from this company, their products are junk that don't work and they do not back them up with a total refund of expenses paid including shipping costs both ways."
3,Included Mac Drivers Didn't Work,"I purchased this because the built-in ethernet port on an older iMac failed. I was surprised when it arrived because the CD said it had Macintosh drivers that *should* have worked with the iMac in questions (hardware, software, etc. met the requirements). However, the device would not connect to the Internet, although the computer saw the device. I installed the free drivers from http://www.sustworks.com/ and then it worked instantly. The hardware itself seems to be working fine, but I lost an hour of my life trying to make D-Link's drivers work.Bottom Line: Buy one for your Mac if you need it (price and h/w specs are good), but just use the free driver and ignore the D-Link CD."
1,RUN AWAY!,"This item is terrible. I bought 2 for my Axiom--really hard to put in--too tight--that should have been my first clue. I charged them and used them. My Axiom has died repeatedly, losing recently stored info that I neglected to back up to my SD card. I'll check the battery power at night and be good to go at 70-90%, get up in the morning and it's dead. Don't waste your money. I tried to give it zero stars, but the system wouldn't accept less than 1."
2,misled,"advertised as 4 oz when received bottle only 1 oz, when I called company they stated it didn't come in 4 oz bottle, false advertising"
2,Special Golden Estrus,"With the Rut right around the corrner I started shopping for scents in early October buying several items via Amazon.Unfortunatly I purchased a 4 ounce Spray Bottle of Special Golden Estrus plus a 4 Pack of key wicks. Long story short, I was shipped the bottle of Special Golden Estrus but no key wicks so much for trying to get this accoplished all online this year."
2,pro and con,"To make my review useful, I have to say I was a teaching assistant using this book for one semester with 50+ students. I read the book from cover to cover (multiple times), solved most of the questions at the end of each chapter, graded the students' solutions, and much more.I have to say, this book is a failure.pro: the book is small, easy to read (but I doubt you can easily understand)con: too many typo! I picked one hundred, at last, I gave up.The presentation is not clear.I recommend ""Elements of the Theory of Computation (2nd Edition)by Harry R. Lewis (Author), Christos H. Papadimitriou (Author)"" as the introductionary book. However, if your instructor picked this book, sorry, you have to buy it. :p"
2,Not for beginners,"the only thing that is good about this book is that its small. Thats it. Price is super high like its made of gold. Honestly, I found it very hard. I read chapter 1 for several times and I couldn't understand the last part of it. Anyone who reads this book has to have someone to help, eg. Teacher or a T.A. The authors just assume that we have previous knowledge about everything. Material is not well explained. It would be much better to google any topic to get a better explaination with examples."
3,nice good and solid,the book was alright...i could have used a few more visual examples and the title of the book is really funny. i had a great teacher so the book's shortcomings were not as noticeable and did not effect the learning process. but overall a pretty good book.
1,One dollar per mosquito,"After twice sending the unit back to the factory, the unit worked for two weeks and again would not turn on. I tried all the suggestions made by the factory. The following year I opened the unit and tried to see what was wrong. I found totally frozen fan bearings. I suppose that the cartriges to repel mosquitoes are corrosive and corroded the bearings. To end my agonies with the unit, I took it to the garbage dump. The unit is cheaply made and therefore unreliable. When it worked, it worked well. I believe it cost me about one dollar per killed mosquito."
3,Works so far,"Caught hundreds of mosquitos in one night, looks like moths are in there too. Maybe they are after the light inside?My yard seems to be better to be in, but still getting bitten guess next few weeks will tell.I paid 1200 for Commercial Pro Mosquito Magnet 2 years ago and it is in the dump now. Biophysics did not stand by there product. So gave this much cheaper option a try. Deep Woods OFF is still my best defense."
1,Does not work!!,"I picked up this unit hoping that it would do the job in my backyard, all that it has picked up is a few ""flying insects"" nothing else. Unless I am missing something, do not waste your money."
1,Flowtron Galaxie didn't work for us!,"We set up the system according to the instructions. We live in MA and our backyard has woods so we set it there and sat on the deck about 50 feet away. The first night it was not very humid and although there were some mosquitos around us, they weren't biting and assumed it was because of the Flowtron. The 2nd time we used it on a far more humid night, we tried to sit on the deck to eat and the mosquitos were swarming and biting us to the point that it was impossible to eat out there and we went inside. The mosquito trap had only about a dozen mosquitos in it from the 2 nights combined. Needless to say, we sent it back for a refund."
4,It does work,"I ran this thing all year long here in Southern California. Its effect was fantastic. I had no nat problem anymore, although I hardly ever found any insects in the trap. This year it does not work. Why? The attractant needs to be replaced and the light bulbs. You find the attractant on the internet, but so far I am unable to identify replacement bulbs."
1,This product does not work,"Don't waste your money, This product does not work. I wish I read the reviews before I bought it."
1,not impressed,I bought this unit for 2 reasons. 1) we have alot of black flies and biting bugs out here in the country 2) It was on clearance for $45. So far in a week it has caught maybe 10 bugs. I stood next to it with black flies swarming all around my head and nothing! I will try it in different locations to see if that improves it's effectiveness. But all in all I'm not impressed. Just glad I didn't pay $180 for it.

2,Even Andy C couldn't save this one,"Being a big fan of Andy C, I quickly snagged this album up after listening to his previous Nightlife albums, and Drum and Bass Arena album for a million times over. I figured, Andy C had to share the decks with Hype, but it couldn't be all that bad, could it? I was wrong here. There's simply too many tracks in which Hype has a cheap sound effect played over the track of some guy blasting out, ""Dj Hype"" or, ""Hype in the Mix"", etc. Way too much shameless self-promotion and not enough emphasis on the music itself.The track selections are okay, but they dont' always flow together well at all. It definitely comes across as 2 djs on two different objectives on 1 album. I'd pass it up, if I didn't already buy it."
4,Red Shelton - Pantomine Skits,"Excellent for beginning drama classes to help them with the history of acting and pantomiming. My students were not excited when the DVD first began and was in black and white, but by the end of the first pantomime, they were hooked. It really did get them excited to start learning the process. My friends my age have found it an interesting trip down memory lane."
5,the enjoyment of horses,i really enjoyed these old movies and i think the entire family will as well. there seems to be a wholesomeness and sincerity about these movies that holds ones' attention. thanks
3,Great Movies/damaged disk,"These four movies are wonderful movies, all time favorites of mine. I was disappointed that one of the disks was damaged, and I had to pay to get it repaired (my favorite out of all four). It is too much of a hassel to pay to have the movie returned and have another one shipped."
3,Great Movies!,"I had to limit the rating on this item to 3 stars as the DVD I received only had 2 movies, not all 4. I always play the DVD to make sure there are no defects or glitches and this DVD had Black Beauty and Seabiscuit on it. National Velvet and Int'l Velvet were not on it. I very much enjoyed Black Beauty and Seabiscuit as they are movies I've seen on TV less frequently than the ""Velvet"" movies. If all 4 movies were on the DVD I'm sure it would be great! I highly recommend these movies for families!"
1,Don't buy this item!,I received this DVD collection and none of the movies that were supposed to be in the collection were on the DVD. Two completely different movies were on the DVD.
2,disapointed,one of the dvds Classic Horse Favorites{ this was a problem because there was 4 movies on it ) was defective and our horse camp only ran for a week so we did not invest the time in returning dvd .
3,Bought this for one movie,"I bought this DVD for only one movie on the DVD. I have been looking for ""International Velvet"" on DVD for years and haven't been able to find it as I have the first ""Velvet"" movie and wanted the second. This was the only way to get it. I actually watched all four movies in succession and loved every one of them. It's good family fun with a bit of suspense thrown in. I actually enjoyed the whole thing, and though I usually like to buy my movies separately I enjoyed this group of movies immensely."
5,Classic Horse Favorites; 4 Film Favorites,"I LOVE International Velvet. This is the real reason I bought the DVD, but now I have 3 other GREAT movies. I appreciate the fact that they are all 'family friendly'!!"
4,"Great Movies, Great Buy",All the classic horse movies - all together - really wonderful - they do not make great movies like these anymore. You will not be disappointed.
3,"A good value release, without Extras.","What you see is what you get! 4 films, no special extras, but 4 old favourites at a reasonable price. Highly recommended to those who just want to watch the 4 films without any bells and whistles. A good choice of movies for the horse lover."
5,A Fun and Easy Read,"Do you ever look around a room in your house and think: I never liked this room; it's too ___________ (fill in the blank!). That's how I was, but I was never sure what to do about it. This book is wonderful for helping you discover the styles and atmosphere you want your room to have and then how to create it.I love how the author emphasizes that your home should be decorated with what makes YOU happy, not what the latest trend is. She has a very straightforward approach for helping you come up with your design. Her many examples of past clients' ""problems"" and their solutions makes the book fun to read as well as informative. Her book never gets bogged down in technical jargon.I highly recommend this book. My husband and I used this process in one of our rooms and we love the result; it's one of our favorite rooms in the house. We are now eagerly working on another one!"
5,"Wow, and wow again!","A decorating book with no pictures? What? There are a few sketches here and there, but the whole point of this book is finding out who you are, and what makes you happy. She has some great, incredibly informative activities (buy a little notebook and do them all. They are wonderful.) I've been pretty confident about my design style and what I like, but this book added so much understanding to my taste.I just moved to a new house and am starting completely from scratch in decorating. I've been so grateful to have my binder and notebook with me to remind me what I like and what makes my heart sing.This book is too deep and thought-provoking to just be about ""decorating"". I've recommended it to everyone I know.No matter what your style, this book will help you!"
1,Highly overrated!!!,"I bought this book on the review of others. Holy cow! What a mistake! I could not even get throught the first chapter. I was absolutely bored. First of all, I do appreciate the authors idea of decorating for the client and not for yourself. All too often decorators and designers do what they would like to see in your home and not particularly what works with your tastes or lifestyle. That part she nailed. The exercises to get to that however are far and away too time consuming and frankly uninteresting. Now part of the reason people hire decorators/designers is because they haven't got a clue as to what they're doing and are in need of ""guidance"". The idea behind this book is good, I just wish the author used a different approach in conveying her message."
2,not all i'd hoped,"With all the good things I heard about this cd i expected it to be MUCH better than it is. I thought a few tracks were worth listening to, Vaporize, for instance. On the whole though I thought the music was repetative, the singing pretty typical and the lyrics like so many others I heard before. I will keep it in my collection for the few songs I like but I won't be listening too it very much. I was disappointed. I have heard good things about the band Failure as well, and was going to check them out, but now I am hesitating. There are cds I have that got worse reviews that I find more inspiring than Year of the Rabbit."
2,Not so fast,"Overall this is a decent CD, but it's nothing spectacular. The songs just come off somewhat bland and corporate, not noteworthy at all, and this is coming from someone who likes Linkin Park and Cold. I was expecting a little more uniqueness from this and at least some excitement, but it sounds like they're just going for the big bucks and making mediocre radio-friendly rock. Save your money."
4,Year of the Rabbit,"I enjoyed this record. Year of the Rabbit is a new band with members who have actual music history, so you know they're not a bunch of fakes riding the new rock trend. But continuing on, Year of the Rabbit is excellent. Their first single, Rabbit Hole, is my favorite. Check them out."
3,So So Effort,"I liked the first third of the album, but after a certain point it all started to sound the same to me. Reminded me of some of the more average moments of Failure. I listened to it strait through this morning, so perhaps it works best in small doses. Make sure you give it a listen before you buy."
5,Awesome!,"If you're a Ken Andrews fan like myself, then you've already got this one, and you also already know that it's an amazing record. Ken really knows how to write a song, and how to produce a record. He's put together an awesome line-up: Jeff Garber (National Skyline, Castor) on lead guitar, Tim Dow (Shiner) in drums, and Solomon Snyder (Cupcakes) on bass. Here me now, and believe me when you buy this album: This is a sonic experience like no other. Check it out!-----NighteyesZX-----"
4,Great product,"The pump is pumping as I write and while it is much louder than the sump pump under my house...it is transfering water from 4 feet under ground out to the street 100 feet away. Primes quickly once you fill the pump via a bolt hole in the top. I tried to draw the water up from my inground tank using a contractor grade hose, but the hose was getting squeezed almost shut from the pumps suction. I went to the hardware store and got 3/4"" PVC and that works great...much better flow. Great product and it would have received 5 stars, but it is a bit louder than I expected...not a problem though since I will only run it 2 hours a couple times a month in the winter."
4,Powerfull pump,"I use this pump to empty an above gound pool. I purchased a sturdy 15' hose for the intake and have had no problems. Like another reviewer noted, I had to buy an adapter for a few bucks to connect the filter onto the input hose end. I connect the output to my sprinkler system and get as much or more power then from the normal water supply. (after 30 minutes the sprinklers stopped, turned out their filters were plugged. Since then I've tied a screen around the intake filter to catch the small derbis and all it well). The only complain I have is that rust comes out of the output side for a few seconds each time I use it. The cast iron must be rusting internally. This may mean nothing or may cause a problem in the long term. For what it's worth, I now empty the pump when I'm finished and spray WD40 thru the input/output holes. Overall, I'm very staisfied with this product."
3,Inner Housing RUSTED,"I received this item very quickly, I hooked it up and was real impressed by the pressure. I ran water through it to test it and see how much pressure it had, I was very impressed with the pressure so I drained it and after about 2 days hooked it up to piping and ran water thru it and it had RUSTED badly inside. We had to breakdown all the piping and clean the piping and pump thoroughly. My suggestion is after using clean it COMPLETELY. A friend of my husband owed him a favor so he powder coated it inside and out, otherwise it would have cost about $50.00. Next time I'll get a cast aluminum vs cast iron. After powder coating I'm very satisfied, great price and pressure."
3,Short tern use,Works realy good until bearings wear out.Using to increase water pressure from irrigation source for lawn sprinkling. I used it about 40 hours last year and about the same this year. It started making bearing noises the last 20 hours and finally slowed down and started smoking from heat.This was a discounted refurbished model.
4,Good Pump,"Heavy duty build, and pumps a lot of water once it gets going, similar to the flow you would see with an outdoor faucet turned all the way up. Only negative things I can think of, and they are minor, it comes with a strainer to keep leaves and other debris from getting sucked into pump, but it did not appear to have a connector to hook this up without buying an adapter? Also, would be nice to have an on/off switch. Kept having to unplug it with wet hands. Would give it a 5 rating but I want to see that it lasts past 2 or 3 uses."
2,It worked while it worked,This pump worked as described over a total of 4 hours of intermittent pumping. Then the motor overheated. To be fair I had hooked it up to an extension cord shortly before it overheated. It was a 14 gauge cord. Which I thought would be large enough.
4,Really powerful pump,I use this to occasionally pump out of a sump in my basement. Its a heavy pump for this purpose and provides a lot of pressure. You could drain a pool with this pump!
3,Meh,"I paid $100 for this pump and it worked well for some time. After a two months of running it intermittently for 5 hours a day, it died. Never called and tried to send it back so I don't know if they would have repaired or replaced it."
4,Wayne PC4 Water Pump,"Bought this pump based on the reviews I had read to drain water that had gotten contaminated with some brown mulch dye out of a water feature on my property. Pump worked as advertised and drained about 300 gallons within a half hour. Only issue I had was with the plastic debris blocker. It has a male end meant to fit the female side of a standard garden hose. I was unable to get the other (male) end of hose to connect solidly to the pump. A male-male connector is supplied (to convert the female connection to a male connection), but that obviously doesn't help with a standard hose. Bottom line - if you want a tight connection to the pump, you have to forego using the debris blocker unless you also buy a seperate female-female connector."
1,Avoid this product and it's terrible support,"Couldn't get this to work properly with XP despite 15 hours effort & 23 contacts with 'support' representatives, over 3 weeks. They got me to try everything except buy a dongle from another company, which I should have done after the first hour. The support was terrible throughout. Even the '3rd line' representatives knew nothing & had to keep emailing 'Taiwan' who made useful suggestions like ""try a parallel install of Windows XP""."
1,No Driver For Win 7,"After already having a bad history with D-Link i decided to give them one more go. I purchased this product and installing the drivers, a window tell me that this software is incompatible with Windows 7. No worries, thinking that the drivers on the disk were outdated i went to d-links website to find out that they have no drivers for win 7, Windows 7 has been out for a little over a year now and they still have no drivers? They have truly proven to me how worthless their consumer products are. they have no support for anything unless your a corporate business dumping thousands into d-link."
1,DID NOT WORK,"Item worked for only intermittently, signal would go in and out, finally just stopped working. Horrible item"
3,Don't buy if you use Windows 7,There are no drivers or software for windows 7. When you install the D-Link BT software you are directed to a Toshiba laptop web site by MS helper program. There is no support to be implemented by D-Link for Windows 7 use.
1,Not As Pictured,"If you came here to buy the specific USB Bluetooth Adapter that the Apple website recommends then I am here to warn you. If your computer runs Mac OS X 10.3.9 like mine then do NOT buy this. Amazon ships an updated version of the adapter that only runs OS X 10.4.3 or later. Even though the specs say on the page something different, they will ship you a NEWER version that will not work with a 10.3.9. I went to Wal-Mart and bought a $20 adapter from IOGear and it works fine for me and was cheaper. This product could work if your computer is running a later version of Mac OS. Just do not go by the description on this page. It is not what you will get."
5,Does what it says it does.,"I use it for my wireless mac keyboard and mouse, and it's worked perfectly fine for 3 weeks. No complaints!"
1,Junk,"Device driver would not install. Simply hangs. Second, this is an OEM of a Toshiba bluetooth adapter. I cannot stand OEM'd products such as this because the support is terrible. Returning the product.Also bought a d-link usb 2.0 hub that locked the computer every time I plugged it in to a known good port, using a known good cable.Probably won't ever buy d-link again."
3,No A2DP.,"This maybe a good BlueTooth (BT) dongle, but possibly does not allow the new BT A2DP profile for stereo audio. I realized this only after ordering it, and had to return."
2,unreliable mess.,"I've used this on and off, always issues and now Blutooh devices canot be found on my PC, even though the drivers are installed and the dongle lights up.This is a mess and better off using something more reliable."
5,works with Vista x64,"Switched to Vista 64-bit, but part of the problem with that is that some devices no longer worked via usb due to a lack of drivers - my palm for example and my cell phone. Bluetooth seemed to be my only workaround for it but that meant finding a bluetooth adapter that works with Vista x64. I got this adapater, plugged it in and hoped for the best. Vista installed it without a hitch. My palm and cell phone have had no issues working with it. Plus that's two less usb cables I need to keep around."
3,didn't work on 1 of my computers,"This item did not work on my HP laptop. It did work on my wife's Toshiba laptop. Worked well (when it worked). Could have been an issue with my laptop (my usb ports are usb 1.1 not 2.0 - wouldn't think that would matter, but who knows)."
2,It would not install until I found an alternate driver,"I got this because it was reported to be one of the only PC bluetooth adapters to link well to a Prius for phone book transfers, but is has been a pain. I previously had a belkin bluetooth key and it was pretty good but the car would not talk with it. This one would not either after jumping though hoops to make it install. Just a dissapointment."
4,Works great - On a Mac,"This item works exactly as promised. On a Mac at least, but then almost everything does. I don't think it's appropriate for Windows users to fault this product for the shortcomings of their OS. With Mac OS X, I plugged the adapter in, and viola!, it worked. I was iSynching with my T68 within seconds. When that was done, I set up Salling Clicker and was using my phone to remotely control iTunes. Not a problem, not ever. There is nothing wrong with this product, and I own several. The only gripe I have is that it seems a bit pricey, but it works so effortlessly that I guess it's worth it."
1,Not working properly with Apple wireless mouse and keyboard,"I am using the DBT-120 ver B3 to operate the wireless Apple keyboard and mouse. If my computer goes into the sleep mode, I cannot wake it up by typing on the keyboard and I have to use the power key on the Apple monitor. When the computer does eventually wake up, it takes a good 2-3 min before the mouse would work. Apple tech support says that they have seen this problem and went through a few solutions but none worked and I was asked to talk to D-link. The D-link tech supports told me that their software stops running when the computer goes to sleep and that is why my keyboard and mouse do not work, and there is no solution to that. Thus, if you plan to use D-link when the computer goes to sleep, it won't work. I am sticking with my wired keyboard and mouse now."
3,"Adequate, but could be better.","I purchased this product to use with the new Apple Wireless Keyboard & Mouse that I received. I have a Quicksilver G4, kinda old, so I needed to add the bluetooth capability to make the peripherals work. I read many positive and negative reviews for this product but ultimately, I bought it because that's explicitly what Apple recommended.It works just fine when connected. The only problems I have come with the computer being in sleep mode. I can no longer wake up the machine using the mouse of keyboard like I could with the connected keyboard & mouse. So it's a little frustrating to have to touch the screen every time instead of simply jiggling the mouse or hitting a key. I don't know if this is a universal problem with bluetooth or it's just my system, but either way it bugs the crap out of me."
1,I'm disappointed,"I bought my D-link Bluetooth 4 months ago and I had only used it two times when it was damage, I can't understand why it stop working suddenly if I used it right, so I'm writing you just for asking about how can you help me to change it by another one in good conditions.Thank youMerry Christmas"
4,Works under Linux and Mac OS X,"I have two of these, both are ver. B4. One I use on my Mac OS X machine, which runs 10.4. I applied the applicable firmware update (see Apple KB No. 120276) so that I could use my bluetooth headset with it on my macintosh. Both of my bluetooth headsets work well on the mac with this adapter.The other one I got for my laptop, which runs gentoo linux and windows. The Dlink works flawlessly on the 2.6.19 kernel (works under 2.6.20 as well) with the standard btsco/btsco-kernel setup.Oddly enough, the most trouble I had with this device was under windows xp. I tried using the drivers that came on the install CD, but for some reason, I could not get sound/audio to work when using Skype. I tried with two different headsets, so I know it's not a headset issue (plus both headsets worked fine with Skype on the mac and linux). Not sure what's going on here, but it looks like the drivers that come with the dongle aren't very good."
1,"Junk, junk, junk","The current version is trash on an XP. Read my lips. 2 hours with tech support, long codes to enter, and is still dont work.Blow this off and buy some good wine instead."
3,Does not pass windows logo,"The problem is its drivers are not digially signed.Well mine dbt-120 is version b4. Although it didnt require any security code but to make it work as per instructions is a task.The problem is everytime u plug in the device, windows loads default drivers and the dlink software didnt detect the device as the drivers r overridden by xp. So to make it work u have to go to device manager and update the drivers from CD Rom.Talked to customer to drivers of other versions.I am going to return it back and would look for something that is fully compatible with win xp"
1,Security Key issue,"I tried to upgrade to the latest drivers and now the DBT-120 is not operational. The drivers for the DBT-120 (revision B3) require a security key that is not provided. I contacted Dlink and they say they cannot give me a security key. Instead they suggest I go to a website and enter my information and the DB (MAC address) of the device. Unfortunately, the website says that my DB # is incorrect (it is not) and returns an error. Dlink will replace the DBT-120 as long as I pay for shipping. That's nuts. Their software broke their device and they want me to pay for shipping to replace their product. After hours on waiting on hold and talking to tech support level 1, 2 and 3, I refuse to purchase another Dlink product ever again."
4,"Easy Setup. Flawless with my Win2K , WinXP & my T616","Suprisingly easy setup with this ""tiny usb plug"" DBT-120. Within 5 minutes (one reboot) and I have my SonyEricsson T616 connect to My Win2K computer and work. (And about same time spent on connecting to my WinXP at home.). With a easy to use interface, transferring files (pictures & midi) from my PC to my T616 is a snap. I would like my T616 support FAX function and that would be perfect but unfortunately T616 doesn't ........ Perhaps my Next or Next Next phone will capable of doing that ........ The package of DBT-120 is tiny and easy to carry. One drawback is D-Link does not provide any carrying case. You ""MAY"" accidentally lose it after you unplug it from your computer."
2,Way too difficult to install,"I bought the D-Link DBT-120 with a Motorola HS820 Headset to use with Skype. The combination works well - but only after many hours struggling with the D-Link software installation. Eventually discovered that the software in the box doesn't come close to working and must be replaced by a new version available online. D-link customer support was a complete waste of time requiring negitiation of a tedious voice response system, a discussion with an individual who collects more information about the caller than the problem followed by a seemingly infinite wait for an product specialist."
1,Does not work with Windows XP SP2,"Spent over 4 hours attempting to get this thing to work, Downloaded the latest drivers, installed them according to directions, it didn't work. Found a not in their support saying that if SP1 is installed you must do something different, did it, then got a ""invalid registration key"" message, but had never been prompted for a registration key. found a message online support for this problem spent over 1 hour completely eradicating the drivers from my machine (per d-links' instructions) including several things from the command line, and setting new environment variables, and using a Windows tool that I'd never seen before. and installed the ""latest"" drivers per instructions, but the same thing happened. Took it back and got the Linksys USBBT adapter (it actually works)."
1,BUYER BEWARE,I followed the instructions that came with this device exactly. The last step said to open My Bluetooth Places. I did that and nothing happened. After researching this I find out that I need a security code. I emailed D-LINK and two different people responded with different answers (not good). One says to go and follow 7 pages of instructions. I do that and it doesn't work. The other says to go to a web site to get a security code. This has been a NIGHTMARE!Multiple calls to tech support later and this device is still not working.If you're looking for a bluetooth adapter that works right out of the box stay away from this one.
1,"Worked with Win2000, but not XP","I've used the DB-120 for about 1 yr with my win2000 laptop. I set it up in about 10 minutes and had it working with my phone almost immediately. Easy.Recently, I moved off of that laptop and migrated everything to a brand new Win XP desktop. After working several hrs this afternoon with the drivers from the Duh-Link site, I've given up trying to get it to work. It is very frustrating, because I've been using it for so long and I know I can follow the instructions. It is going on ebay and I'm replacing it with something that's ready to be used in XP.My advice, if you want to try this with XP, it may work or it may not...just know that you are gambling. Save yourself the trouble and go get something else that is more stable."
1,"Adapter works, Drivers don't",The bluetooth adapter works fine with the generic XP SP2 drivers. The drivers that come on the cd with the adapter do not install properly and are't even needed if you have SP2. I didn't find this out until I found the info on the internet. Dlink Tech support was not aware of this. If you buy this product don't install the drivers from the cd. It's ironic I bought dLink because I didn't want to go though driver hell.
1,They need to pull it from the market,"No one with average or moderate computer skills will be able to implement their updated drivers. I noted each step I took and thought ""what would Mom and Pop do here?"". After going into DOS prompt (you're done, Mom) I updated the new drivers (they're zipped, Mom)and found that setup.exe would not initiate. Stop. This is where you realize the manufacturer is bogus and order Linksys or somebody dependable. Don't buy it or just take the loss and move on."
1,Difficult to install.,After downloading the software and attempting to use this product I kept getting an error message stating I did not have the proper liscense. I had to go to the FAQ page to get the instructions. The adaptor finally worked after about 45 minutes of downloading current drivers etc. I bought a similiar product from the local Walmart store for a couple dollars less. No problems whatsoever with the installation. I would not recommend the DBT-120 Bluetooth Adapter.
1,No 64-bit drivers!!!,It is absolutely unbelievable that there are no drivers for Windows XP x64.What decade does D-link think we are in?
3,not vista friendly,neither the cd that it comes with nor the d-link website has vista drivers. you either have to use bluesoliel 6 on a trial version and have data transfer limited or purchase it.
3,Word of caution for Mac users,"It's not a big thing, but the version of this adapter that is shipped now does not look like the one pictured and is a newer version (C1) that does not allow a wireless keyboard or mouse to wake a sleeping Mac even with a download of the firmware upgrade available through Apple online support. Older versions of this adapter (such as B2) will allow the waking function with the firmware upgrade. I have an iMac G5 running OS X 5.0.1 (Leopard). I received the adapter yesterday and its install was very easy, basically plug-and-play. It works perfectly with my wireless keyboard and mouse once computer is awakened using old wired mouse."
3,Close but no cigar,Had to return the item for credit as I could not get Bluetooth to work with my HP laptop and T-Mobile MDA phone. Went through the support routine with all levels at D-Link and they also had no joy! Bummer - had to go retail for a Kensington unit that worked first time - go figure.Amazon was great and had no problem with return.
1,Bluetooth failure,"I was unable to get the adapter to work on my desk top computer. My cell phone has Bluetooth. My first attempt to follow the download directions was unsuccessful; my fault. I tryed to remove all of the software, but gave up after several efforts. My two calls to D-link were long, with the emphasis on my removing the software and trying again (in other words, nothing I did not already know). Eventually, the tech guy said he would have to consult with his supervisor and that I should call back. I have given up, I now email the photos to myself from my cell phone."
1,Latest version C1 does not work with Mac,"I got this adapter so I could use it with my new bluetooth phone. Unfortunately, they sent me the newest version of the adapter, C1, and it does not currently work with OS X version 10.4.8 or earlier. Bluetooth Updater 1.5 will not fix this also. The new version has different graphics, which is orange on black. Earlier A and B versions have the white on green graphic, and will work with Mac OS X."
1,"Buy something else instead, this adapter is very bad","This device requires you to ""register"" your adapter to receive a ""security code"" before you can install the driver. If you lose the code, you have to go to a third-part site to re-register the driver and get a new code...that is unless the website refuses to issue a new one because the adapter you own is ""already registered.""Save yourself the trouble and get a different BT adapter that doesn't make you jump through these hoops."
1,Piece of Junk,"Don't waste your time and money on this piece of junk! I tried to install the software 5 times...because I couldn't get it to work. I called customer service...after waiting for more than 30 minutes for them to answer the call, they couldn't get it to work either. The customer service person, then said that there was one more thing we could try...and the call was disconnected. I called back and waited for more than an hour...before hanging up in disgust. The bottom line? A piece of junk, with non-existant customer support!"
1,"Mac users, note your OS X number.","This item could be 5 starts, could be none, no way for me to tell since the product I was sent is a different version than what is listed here. Like a previous purchaser who has Mac OS X 10.3.9 like I do, Specs here say you need 10.2 or higher, but the actual package that was sent says you need 10.4.3 or higher. It also says you require a 1.1 USB, but the package title is 2.0 USB. I don't know if that matters. Color is orange, not blue."
1,WRONG SPECS FOR MAC - NEEDS OSX - 10.4.3 OR HIGHER,"I checked the specs prior to ordering, and this should have worked - said it needed Mac OS 10.2 or higher. I have 10.3.9. Got exactly what I ordered, however the specs on the package state Mac OS 10.4.3 or higher required. Will not work on my system. What a waste of time."
3,DBT-120-GRAY-Version 1.2,"The model received was the correct but the dongle that is displayed by the vendor is not the same that I received (gray dongle-BlueCore2-Ext), and this is a Bluetooth Version 1.2 :("
1,"D-Link DBT-120 Bluetooth USB Adapter, PC","Not very user friendly, and does not work with the devise that it advertised to work with."
4,No problems,No problems loading and works fine. I would given it 5 stars if it wasn't made in China. I use it for file transfer to my phone from my computer. No complaints.
2,Nice when it works,"I received this item as a gift. The main use was to provide bluetooth functionality to my IBM T30 so that I could keep my T68i contact and calendar synchronized.Installation was a pain. Reading the manual first is essential. However, when I finally did get it working it worked well, really well! This happy state of affairs lasted for about three weeks. At that time it would occasionally turn itself off. I'd have to pull it out of the USB port and re-insert it to get the device going again. Eventually (a couple of weeks later) it just stopped working.It took about 3 days and 2.5h of phone calls to finally get a human on the D-Link helpline, and not a very friendly one at that. The device was returned to D-Link (at my cost) for replacement (at their cost). They received it on 15 October 2003. It is now 5 November and I am still waiting for the replacement to ship.Great device when it works. Bad when it doesn't. Awful if you need D-Link service."
3,"Good piece of hardware, weak software",If you don't mind fiddling with software installs then this is a good bluetooth adapter to choose. It's the smallest that I could find and the range is great: My computer upstairs has no trouble connecting to my phone downstairs.Overall I give this product 3 stars because the software seems flakey. One one of my Win2K computers the install said that it completed but when I rebooted it complained about not finding BtBalloon.dll. I searched the install files and found a file called BBalloon.dll. So I copied it to \WINNT\system32 and renamed it BtBalloon.dll and it was happy. On another computer the software just stopped working and I had to reinstall.As others have said download the latest drivers from the DLink web site and don't use the ones on the CD.I use this device to connect to my Sony Ericsson T616
2,No Bluetooth Headset support for OS X,Works well with sync for cell for both PC and Mac. Wanted to use Skype with MAC laptop. Bummer no headset support.
5,great product for the money,"With both rebates, this adapter costs less than $20. Installed easily and runs fine on winxp. Make sure you pull down the latest drivers from the d-link website and you should be fine.Mike"
1,Flimsy and fragile,"I bought this to work with my Macintosh. I needed a wireless USB adapter to work with my wireless keyboard and mouse. Since this was the least expensive unit, I bought it. I installed it with no trouble, and it performed well. After owning it for a couple weeks, I was moving my computer around and bumped the adapter against my desk. The two halves of the outer plastic casing popped off and the metal connector bent slightly. I popped the case back together and straighted it out, but it no longer worked. Since I thought it was my fault, I bought another one. I had only owned the second one a couple days, when I bumped the adapter with my foot while crossing my legs. Guess what? The same thing happened. This time I don't think it's my fault. The price is good and the performance is okay, but the construction is flimsy."
1,"Put this item on your ""Do Not Buy"" List","Yesterday I received my D-Link DBT-120 Bluetooth adapter and spent 2 hours trying to get it installed and talking to my Bluetooth Nokia cell phone. The CD installation disc did not work as I have Windows Vista. Next I downloaded new Windows Vista compatible software from Toshiba. After two attempts, it finally installed and it found my Nokia cell phone. But no matter what I did, it refused to connect my PC to my cell phone. Just a ""connection failed"" message and no further help. If you have Windows Vista, put this item on your ""Do Not Buy"" List. Oh yes, I contacted D-Link before purchasing it, and they said it is Windows Vista compatible.I finally installed Nokia software and got the system to work. But for what one must go through to get Bluetooth to work, it's not worth the effort!I strongly recommend that one should purchase a hardwire connector for use in connecting a PC to a cell phone."
5,"works great on PC's, and even better on Mac's","I have a PC and this uetoth adapter works great, its easy and quick to transfer files to and from my computer. My brother, who has a Mac, has this same adapter, but the software for macs alows him to browse his phone from his computer, and has alot more options for how to transfer files. I would recomend this for anyone, its pretty simple to use andhas worked perfectly for me."
1,30 Day Evaluation Period,"I purchased this device for my new pc with windows 7 running on it. The device worked great and i was able to connect my phone to my pc and transfer files back and forth. Then i noticed the evaluation period on the device manager. when the evaluation period ended the device became useless with very poor technical support (All they do is ask questions unrelated to the device then put you on hold forever and transfer you to another associate when you mention the device manager is going to expire). Eventually after being left on hold for an half hour i gave up and hung up the phone. If i knew the device would stop working i would have returned it, but since it expired after the return item date, i guess i will have to eat the $19.99 i paid for the device. Because of this I give the device a rating of 1 star. if i could i would give it a negative ten star rating because of this."
2,Terrible installation for Windows XP,"Trying to install this product in Windows XP was terrible, XP wanted to use the generic drivers for the product since the generic ones were digitally sign and didn't want to use the ones that were actually for this hardware, I had to go in a tell it specifically what drivers to use before i could continue to follow the instructions provided with the Bluetooth adapter.D-Link fails to have any new drivers on their site that have passed the compatibility tests for Windows XP, so you're stuck with using the ones that haven't been proven to be stable.However, once I had successfully installed the product it seemed to work more or less correctly, except every so often my regular internet connection would die, because XP would start trying to get the internet over the Bluetooth for unknown reasons."
1,Terrible Cust Service & Unusable Product,"D-Link's customer service is the worst I've ever encountered. I got the DBT-120 to use with my Nokia 6230 and my Windows XP computer, went to D-Link's site to download the newest driver and thought I'd be up and running in about 10 minutes. The software requires a 32 character security code which I couldn't find, so after some initial looking around online, called tech support. Bottom line, I wasted several hours trying to get a code so I could finish the software installation. No one at D-Link was able to look up or create this code for me.Save yourself some time and frustration and look elsewhere."
5,Works great with my WindowsXP and Ti68 phone,"I was surprised to read of all the issues that other Windows users had. Maybe I didn't have any problems because I'm using WindowsXP, but everything installed just fine. Maybe I'm just better at following instructions :). I bought it mostly so that I could synch my Sony Ericsson Ti68 with Outlook (Calendar, Contacts, Tasks). Bluetooth is much more reliable than the Infrared connection method that my phone also supports.This device automatically detects when I'm near my computer with my phone and starts syncronizing automatically.The USB extension cord is very thin (think microphone cable) and it allows me to quickly connect this adapter without crawling under my desk to find the USB ports (why do most PC companies continue to put these on the back?).Overall, I can't recommend this highly enough. It's great price is just a bonus."
1,"Small device, big headache.","I'm always up for a challenge to get things working, however, for the life of me, I could not get this little sucker up and running right w/ Win2k. It appeared that the CD software version was incorrect w/ the device version (version B4, BTW). I just kept getting ""Security code invalid"" errors. I checked D-Link's support website; the FAQ was horribly bland and the ""updated"" driver did not work as well (it seemed my CD software version was the same as the downloadable updated version). I searched Google w/ no help.Horrible, horrible, horrible. Fire the QA dept!I returned it today and bought the Belkin F8T001 and things couldn't be any simpler. I was up and running in under 5 minutes (the software installation and reboot took the most time)."
1,Bad Times,Installed everything including driver from D-link website and didn't work. I don't think it works well with XP. Computer didn't recognize it. Called tech support (and you know how long that takes)and eventually they told me to just return it. I have to give it a 1 because it didn't even work. Tried on 2 different computers. Now I'm scared to buy any Bluetooth USB adapters thats are cheap but I don't want to pay a lot.
1,DON'T BUY IF YOU ARE RUNNING XP SP2,"Bought it, DBT-120 REV B41. Installed drivers from CD, they don't work.2. Called D-Link Tech Support, they had me download REV B4 drivers from the web, they don't work.3. Called D-Link Tech Support, was told to download and install REV B3 drivers, they don't work.4. Called D-Link Tech Support, case was elevated to Level 2, was told drivers don't work on XP SP2, they are looking into it, my best bet was to return it."
3,"Vista and Toshiba stack great, no A2DP though!","This product works great with my Logitech Bluetooth mouse. I didn't even install any software- my Laptop came with Windows Vista and Toshiba ""Bluetooth Stack""-I plugged it in and didn't need to install any drivers. It found my mouse right away. I can unplug it and plug it back in, and it immediately is configured, no messing around with waiting for it to find the device again, etc...The only Cons are that this DOES NOT SUPPORT A2DP audio streaming. (Per an email from their tech support I finally got back today.) I wanted to get some headphones to listen to my laptop but all the headphone reviews say that if you don't have A2DP then it will sound ""tinny"". (so minus 2 Stars!)And I wish I'd gotten a PCMCIA adapter so I don't worry about busting this dongle-type device off.Otherwise it works just as it should and I'm pretty happy with it- I just need to 'upgrade' to a newer one I guess.."
1,Support is awful,This item will not work with vista the support they offer has no idea of what you are talking about don't seem to know the product or care and frankly are rather rude. I feel item should not be sold with the new portable printer as not compatible.
5,No complaints,I got this piece of hardware to interface my Razr V3 with my computer. For that purpose it works flawlessly. Once I got the Razr and my computer talking I decided to see if my iPaq would interface with my computer. Setting up activesync was a snap. This piece of hardware is small enough to fit into any of the USB ports I have even with other peripherals plugged in. I would highly recommend this product.
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH MACS,"The problem is that the DLink has to work with USB 2.0 and if your Mac has usb 2.0, it probably has the built-in bluetooth already. Their ""help"" department couldn't answer that simple question, I had to research it myself. It is advertised as being Mac Compatible, but only if you have USB 2.0. Suck feast!"
1,pure disappointment,"my rating is strictly based on the dealer, not the item itself. i know i waited way too long to post a comment, but i am very busy. i never received my bluetooth adapter. i ordered it on 10/10/2008. i would not be surprised in the slightest if they cannot do anything about it now. it's my own fault for failing to post this review earlier. but i did however, try to email them about a week past the arrival date and i did not get ANY response back. not even an automated one!ps: i was never reimbursed. i still had to pay $20 (plus tax/shipping) for a product i NEVER received."
5,D-Link Bluetooth adapter,"Works GREAT right ou tof the box! I own an Apple G4 running Tiger and had no problems at all. Just opened the box, plugged into my USB port and I was getting a signal instantly. OS X has all the bluetooth software pre-installed...Couldn't have been easier!!"
2,Embarrassing Customer Support - does not support iMac sleep,"Just received this device and installed it - works well when my iMac DUO is running but will not wake the computer from sleep. Option box for Bluetooth is grayed out. Seems simple enough until you try to get help from DLINK. After minutes on hold, I was transferred overseas to an apathetic agent with broken English who had little to no experience with MAC Tiger. Read me FAQ's and then told me Apple had to change their program settings to work with their adapter. If this wasn't good enough - then return the product. Sorry attempt at support - won't be considering DLINK for any future equipment needs."
5,Does what it should,This was easy to connect and it worked fine for me with the default Windows XP drivers.
5,D-Link DBT -120 Bluetooth USB Adapter,"Using on an HP notebook with XP Home edition OS. Installation of drivers/software was quick, very easy setup. Product works very well, don't need to stay close to the antenna for this to work. I previously used a USB wireless mouse, had to be within 2 ft to expect reliability. Now using a Logitec optical Bluetooth enabled mouse,I can use the mouse at a convenient distance often using the arm of a chair or my leg as a mouse surface when no flat surface is available. No drop outs experienced. Highly recommend this product for short range Bluetooth devices."
5,Quick and Easy,"I own a first generation Mac mini (Power PC), so it didn't come with bluetooth. I've been using D-Link Bluetooth Adapter DBT-120 for a month now and it works perfectly with both my Palm TX and Motorola K1. The Macintosh OS X 10.4.3 has built-in Bluetooth support for a true plug and play experience, so I didn't have to do a thing to get it working. However, it's a whole different story for Windows PC users, they have to install additional software provided on a CD-Rom."
1,Does not work with Lego Mindstorms,"The older version may have worked, but this version as of 1-09 does not. The software is a disaster. It is not even certified for windows XP SP2. I spent hours working on this to no avail."
5,Super easy to set up,"Love this!Got the package, plugged it into my PC, ran the set up software, plugged it into my printer and now I have blue-tooth enabled printing! (for my cell, mac laptop, etc.)Great functionality for the price."
1,recommend against purchase: unusable drivers on Win2000 and XP 64bit,"I bought 2 of these, and found myself returning them both. I found that they do not support Windows 2000, nor do they support Windows XP 64-bit. Neither was of any practical use to me."
3,"Price is reasonable, quality not so good","The price is reasonable, I got this at about 20 bucks. The performance is normal."
2,"works some of the time with Macs,/windows","This is the particular bluetooth adapter that Apple recommends. And it works about just as well with Macs as it does with PC's, which in my case is not so well. I have motorola phones that work seamlessly with my mini-macs with built in bluetooth, but the same phones using the same software do not work well at all using the external DBT-120 adapter on a G5/Thinkpad/whitebox PC, in fact I returned it due to its poor performance. It may be the motorola phones are a bit tricky, but there is no point in having an adapter that doesn't work for its intended purpose."
1,worse product I've ever bought on amazon,Do _not_ buy this DBT-120 if you use windows XP. You will regret it.app. rev. B4.
2,"Hard to install, old drivers, but works once installed","I purchased this to use my Treo 650 (Cingular) for email and internet access for my laptop. The installation was a complete nightmare, the drivers are old and the the documentation on the website seems complete, but the connector still does not install right when following them. It all stems from windows XP installing drivers without allowing the device drivers that come with the adapter to be loaded.Once I did get it installed, it works great, no problems.I would probably get the Belken USB Bluetooth adapter. If you are using it for the same reason I am, Cingular even has install instructions on its site to set up the wireless functionality."
2,"Ought to call it ""Weak Link"" - failed after 3 months","Yeah, I bought one. And it worked. Flawlessly... for a while.Used it from June to August, and then it died.Why? I don't know. I plugged it in once and left it, but one day, the bluetooth mouse and keyboard would not respond.I brought it back to the Apple store where I bought it, and they replaced it. I didn't have my receipt or any packaging, but Apple gave me no hassle at all. They didn't even ASK for the receipt. Cool. They exchanged it on the spot. Now I'm on i-link number 2. I hope this one lasts longer than 3 months.I give it two stars because it works well, and if you buy from an Apple store, you can apparently get a new one if it fails."
1,not compatible with Windows vista,it does not say anywhere on the documentation of the item that it is not Windows vista compatible. I tried to look for drivers and there are none to speak of. Unfortunately I wasn't able to return this item because my housekeeper accidentally threw it away. If you don't have vista I'm sure it works fine.
1,Not worth the time or money,"DLink's DBT 120 (version C) isn't worth the frustration - have installed, uninstalled and repeated so many times, and the foolish thing still isn't working.An exercise in futility... don't buy it!!"
3,Not the best out there,"As a tea drinker, an electric kettle is indispensible. This was purchased after my ancient Philips model died and at the time no other Philips was available (now there is one on this site that I would recommend). This KRUPS looks fashionable and is made in France (not China), but is less than convenient. The lid is not hinged and must be removed with a push button to fill. The built in filter is then free to fall out if you empty the kettle. It is quiet when boiling and doesn't steam, but you must push and hold down a button to open the spout. It is slower to boil than my old Philips. Form before function; something I've experienced with other KRUPS products, and I shan't do it again."
2,Bad base receptacle design,"While very convenient to use, this kettle has one major flaw: the design of the electrical receptacle in the base. We have had this unit for a little over a year and with heavy use (boiling water 4-5 times a day) the receptacle pins wore out and bent. It's in a non-working and probably dangerous state. Needless to say the 1-year warranty is over and replacing the base will cost more than half of the new unit. I guess this is called ""planned obsolescence"". Avoid this unit and look for other brands (We are looking at Braun and Hamilton Beach)."
2,Krups Electric Kettle,"I had high hopes for this kettle and it worked very well for most of the first 6 months of ownership. Then it began to automatically cut out before it had come to a boil, and I had to wait for the thermostat to click before I could give it another try. It took numerous attempts to get it to actually boil. As any tea connoisseur knows, it is essential to make tea on a rolling boil, and overboiled or water repeatedly boiled water flattens the taste. If you don't actually require the water to boil, this can be an excellent kettle."
1,Leaks after a year!,"My Krups 859-70 is now useless. After less than a year of very light use, it leaks water continuously and floods the counter top. I have to boil then empty! Complete rubbish, compared to some great kettles I used to own back in England."
2,Great BUT !!!,"As others have stated, this is a great product. But after a year it has developed a split in the water gauge, and hot water leakes so we can only boil if less than 7.5 cups. I have written to Krups but no answer. Twice I have burnt my hand with the water leaking out."
5,Best tea I've ever had,"After trying many tea makers, I decided that the ""old fashioned"" way of making tea was best for me. Not long after, my mother found the Krups and bought it for me. I fell in love instantly! The water was just perfect - not underheated nor overboiled - just the way I like it. I've had the tea kettle for more than a year now and it continues to work flawlessly. If you decide on this tea kettle, I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I have."
5,5+ years old and going stong,"We purchased two of these for making tea and instant coffee at the office. They have been working fine for more than 5 years.I have had no problem with the filter falling out (not a single time). I have not had any problem with either machine failing to work. They work quickly every time they are turned on. I now use one at home to heat chicken or vegetable stock when making risotto or couscous because it is faster than using the stove. I also like that it is safer than using a teakettle or pan protecting curious little fingers.I do have one caveat for others. If you fill the pot right to the top (beyond capacity), when you press the button to retract the lip to pour the water, the steam that escapes is very hot on your thumb. However, I think this is more an operator error than a design flaw.Overall, I highly recommend this product for its speed, usefulness and for lasting 5 years with regular use."
2,Two years is totally accurate!,"I purchased mine three years ago and have battled getting it to work for over a year. I finally just thew it away. Initially it worked great, but after two years things it didn't heat every time I placed it on the base. Eventually I had to prop it up to reach a certain angle before it would engage."
2,Can burn you,"I was dissappointed with the quality of this product. After about 6 months use the automatic swith-off feature started to fail and the kettle would end up boiling dry. This did not appear danngerous, since the outer casing did not overheat. However while the kettle continued to boil I found that a lot of steam escaped around the handle, necessitating the use of an oven glove to pick the kettle up. The kettle was also relatively slow to boil, compared with others I was able to buy back in the UK."
5,My husband thinks this was the best Christmas present ever!,"Okay, so the spout filter thingy falls out if you dump out the water, and you do have to hold down a button to pour the water, but we have had the kettle for about three years and it works great! He makes tea every morning (he hates my flavored coffees) and I make herbal tea every evening. No rusting, no malfunctions. It heats quickly and to a full boil. This is the first product review I have ever written and I only did it because I had such a different experience from the other reviewers. We LOVE this and would buy another in a heartbeat."
5,Makes me want to sing...,"Not really, but it does make me want to look up more information on the Blue Hearts. The plot is simple - a member of a girl band hurts her finger before the school's festival. And two of the members have a fight, causing one of them to leave the band. Now the remaining girls need to train a new singer only days before the gig. They recruit a Korean exchange student who can barely speak the language.The themes that run throughout the film are more complex than the plot. Friendship, memories, love, the end of one era of one's life and the start of a new one.Besides the culture tips and the Blue Hearts audio FAQ, there isn't much in the way of extras and that was a tad disappointing. VIZ did such a good job with Train Man and Kamikaze Girls.But still worth getting for those who love Japanese culture, Japanese music or a good movie."
5,One warning,"The only warning I would give for any non-Japanese or Korean speaker purchasing this DVD is that the subtitles do not distinguish when the Son character is speaking Korean rather than Japanese. There are, I believe, five scenes when she does use Korean. One can, with effort, identify most of them for she speaks then with confidence only seen otherwise perhaps as she masters the Japanese songs. Without knowledge of the switch in languages the viewer may find the interaction between her and the others confusing."
1,Unbelievably dull,"The only people who could honestly say that they related to this static, dull and poorly written film are Japanese girls who've recently graduated high school. And I lived and taught in Japan...the distributors stooped so low as to say on the cover that the film had been ENTERED into several film festivals, but no mention of winning anything. How low will these people go?"
5,Into My Soul - Kirk Whalum,"Excellent delivery time. Product condition was excellent.Also, Amazon has the greatest collection of Jazz and Smooth Jazz in the country !"
2,Service Great!....music not so great.....,I received my cd in record time and in great condition....Into My Soulbut was not impressed by the music. Kirk Whalum has done much better. This cd left something to be desired.
1,There's one born every minute...,"My dog plays better jazz. Try something real like Sonny Rollins, Horace Silver, Charles Mingus, Dizzy and The Bird, Dave Brubeck or John Coltrane. That stuff is jazz. This stuff is no better then Muzac. I'd call it easy listening."
5,Excellent for beginners and former students,"I think the book is excellent for beginners; it is much better than the books I used when first learning Latin in high school. However, the course is also excellent for those who want to refresh their Latin. By using the running vocabulary as mandatory instead of optional and reviewing the grammar points, a former Latin student can quickly regain his/her proficiency in the language. In addition to covering major aspects of grammar such as the subjunctive, use of deponent and defective verbs, and future passive participles, there is increased focus on the reasons why cases (not just the ablative) are used in the ways they are. The text is engaging and slowly increases in difficulty, and best of all, unlike most Latin courses, the vocabulary is not merely setting you up to read De Bello Gallico, perhaps the most boring book ever written in Latin."
1,Hard to configure rules and policies,"I am a very technically proficient person, and I find this device difficult to configure.If you want this device for just a simple firewall to keep the bad guys out, it is fine. You can plug it in and it works out of the box. (Personally, I would rather buy a $39 router instead)If you want to allow certain access to specific computers on the inside LAN, use something other than this device. It is difficult to figure out, and the tech support is weak on D-Link's site for this model."
1,Junk,"This vpn firewall is still on D-Link's website. A discontinued product. And good riddance, this is a piece of junk. Compared to DFL-200 and 700 the 300 is a joke. Do not even buy one used, you will regret the hassle. Trust me, I work with this stuff every day, all day, I allowed myself to be snookered on this one, you don't have to."
2,An interesting pamphlet.,"Not really a book, more like a pamphlet. About the length and depth of a magazine article, excluding the repetition. Not well focused on Mr Wilkins either, but an easy quick read, and interesting."
5,3D Review by a 3D Connoisseur,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.There are about 70 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. Another 30 around 25%. At 8:00 minutes a tri-blade throwing knife reaches 40% and at 64:00 minutes, a large blood spatter drop exceeds 50%. Too many OOS effects to pick my favorites.*** A MUST SEE 3D - STATE OF THE ART AT ITS FINEST ****** Almost Continuous Action - Blood, Guts, Gore and Horror ***MY 3D RATING = EXCELLENT (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.Click on `See all my reviews' for the lowdown on other 3Ds"
5,Awesome. Watched it 2 times in a row.,"First, I went to watch this movie in a theater, also in 3D. I love 3D in general. Although this movie contains one part where it makes me dizzy; in the very beginning the camera pans out to space while rotating, and then goes back down to Earth. As many times as I watched it, it always makes me dizzy. I liked the story, although I have to admit I got it from watching this movie the 2nd time. My favorite part is the fight in the showers with abnormally huge ""Silent Hill Pyramid Guy"" ripoff Zombie. I always wondered, where have they found such a huge actor. It could be CGI though. This movie is full of really cool visual effects. So far it's one of the Best 3D effects of a Blu-ray on our Passive LG Display. Love Mila and Ali too."
1,What a let down,"As a long time fan of both the games and the movies, I was anxious to see the new movie after the ending of the last Resident Evil movie. I was sorely disappointed with all aspects of this movie. The plot was quick to make major changes in the beginning then shifted to a slow moving plot throughout the middle, and finished with the worst ending of the series that I have seen. It was done to completely set up for another trivial sequel. Although the plot makes Alice ""human"" again, she seemingly is able to do her same ""kick butt"" moves and heroine action. Again, a let down for me."
4,"Great movie, but meant for 3D","I loved the movie! I've been following the Resident Evil movies since the first one came out. I've loved them all, and this one is no exception. The plot was good, the effects were stellar, as always, and the acting was superb. My only complaint about the movie was that because it was shot for 3D, the action sequences rely heavily on the 3D aspect of the film, and without the 3D, the action sequences are detracted from by it. I don't like 3D; that's just my personal opinion, and I think that the action sequences in this movie suffer because there are parts of them that are obviously made for 3D, and without the 3D aspect, they seem to lack somewhat in punch compared to the others."
2,Just an unrealistic shoot 'em up with no little plot exploration and character development,"Fight scenes are more unbelievable than a Steven Segal film. Characters are left undeveloped, serving simply as people to fire bullets as zombies. Plot is predictable. Essentially, it feels like a video game--but it's supposed to be a movie."
4,Great in 3D,"The special effects are great in this movie, if you have a 3D TV I would definitely recommend this, very entertaining and visually stunning!"
4,get it in 3d,great 3d movie with all the cheesy special effects. decent movie not in 3d. but if you are reading this you probably are reading reviews for some funny comments. so big bada boom oops wrong milla movie
2,bitter sweet,"I received this dvd real fast, just in time for the release of the new movie. I enjoyed it until I saw they stole scenes from Matrix at the end of the movie, it was very dissapointing seeing that they run out of creativity. Oh well.It is enjoyable."
4,not bad,"Not as good as the others, however, I found it just as entertaining. Plot was pretty easy to figure out. Not bad for some mindless entertainment."
3,Watched It And Waiting For The Next,"I've finally watched the latest Resident Evil film. It wasn't great, but it had some pretty awesome 3D effects. Besides that, there are only two other factors that make this movie worth watching.1. Milla Jovovich kicks ass.2. The film score is dynamite.Personally, I feel that the movie wasn't all that great because of the way the characters appeared. Their portrays are completely different from the game. Plus the new characters didn't have much of a role. Nevertheless, I love watching the heroine Alice fight. She's the only thing that make these films worth watching. Its without a doubt action-packed, but my overall rating for this film is 3 1/2 stars. When it was over, the ending definitely left one word in mind, ""sequel"". Hope the next film is just as good."
5,Lived up to the first!,This resident evil finally brought the character development that was needed the story keeps your interest and added a lot to the story.... Definitely satisfying and a great addition to the saga...
3,Average,Well I wasn't expecting much of this one and the movie is what it is an action zombie movie that once you see it you will forget it
3,Alice is back and she brought some friends,"While the fourth live action Resident Evil movie was done in 3D, but it only sucks that I do not own a 3D TV to make watching it at home in any way like that. As for the movie itself I think it's on par like that of Apocalypse, and little better than that of Extinction. Anyone that has played Resident Evil 5, will recognize some things that were taken from that game including one of the main baddies of the whole Resident Evil franchise that finally gets more screen time in this movie. The story itself picks up where Extinction left off at and exploring some of the things that they weren't able to do in that movie, though the writing was good, though it felt like it could've been a tad better to me anyways. The action was great to me and couldn't have been any better and the acting was solid from some to most of the actors I think. Overall I give this film 3 stars out of 5."
3,Maybe better with 3D effect,"Take two cups of the Matrix, one cup 28 Days Later, a teaspoon of Knight and Day and one cup Resident Evil series and you have this latest installment of Resident Evil: Afterlife. Worth my $1.99 rental, story has good action but lacked depth, has a couple of how did that happen scenes, left me feeling incomplete. Liked the male eye candy."
3,"Average, pretty much the same stuff","I watched the Trilogy and thought this would be a nice addition. It's pretty much the same exact thing, nothing really new. Graphics are a little better and I get to watch it on my 13 foot dvd screen so that is cool, but there is nothing really new with this one. Still worth a watch I guess.Edit:I'm writing this edit after I saw the end. The end was pretty good, just like in the other movies. Again, it hints that there's gonna be a sequel to this one. I am kind of suprised that they made this many Resident Evil movies. I know they made a ton of the games, but I didn't think the movies were as popular as the games. Nonetheless, I still think the Trilogy shines way more than this movie does. I think this one was cool because it was in 3-d and it would have been really scary to watch some of the parts in 3-d as you know which parts they were. Either way the movie is evil like the other ones. I still like the Trilogy best."
3,;0),"It's not bad the beginning took a while, I think the series is dwindling a bit the action are less and less and this set of cast was ok. I think they should quit while they are ahead now. It's still watchable and a good movie to watch but not the best."
2,This movie is not good...,"I cannot believe that such a great video game franchise and existing story frame work cannot receive a decent film. This movie is as cheesy and dumb as the rest of the Resident Evil films, complete with poor acting, a lame and inconsistent storyline, terrible characters, ridiculous effects and just plain stupidity. I am amazed that they still produce these movies and that after so many attempts, it is impossible to make a decent one. Please stop making such ridiculous movies...all your doing is killing a great franchise....don't waste your time on this film."
1,Awful,"I can't believe I paid money for this. There was no character development, no plot etc. It's pretty bad that they actually had a budget to make this movie, the effects weren't even that great as there was no substance behind them. Don't waste your money on this."
3,Average but enjoyable,"Pros:+ Zombies are cool+ ExplosionsCons:- Explosions are far more important than plot or actingOverall it's just what you would expect from an RE movie. I personally like them but the mindless violence and mediocre CGI isn't for everyone. If you like the other ones, you will probably like this as well. It's nothing new."
3,Weakest of the series? - movie review only,I thought the 1st one was okay to pretty good.The 2nd one uped the action & weirdness very well.The 3rd one had me very interested from beginning to end.This one didn't have much except regular zombies for the most part which was disappointing. The beginning sequence was a neat way to capitolize on the end of the 3rd movie. I really wish it had ended about 3 minutes before it did. The cliff-hanger was not needed in my opinion nor do I hope they make another one to resolve it. I think the series should pretty much end here but somehow I doubt it will.Worth a rental not a purchase in my book.
5,"I'm a huge Resident Evil movie fan, so yeah...","I must say that I pay attention at the beginning of the movie and at the end of the movie, but during the part in the middle (from her first being in that two-seat monoplane until they get to the ship) I usually tend to multitask and not pay much attention to it."
4,Not the best of the series--and not the worst,"RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE looks wonderful on Blu-Ray--sounds great too. Unfortunately, the film lacks some of the verve and heft of the earlier films. Mila Jovovich and Ali Larter are good--but the film seems tired--as if there's nowhere new to go in the series. Don't get me wrong, it's still fun--it's just not quite as much fun as the earlier films in the series."
1,Took forever to ship from Amazon,I ordered this item at least a week before release and Amazon did not ship it until a week after it was released.Resident Evil: Afterlife [Blu-ray 3D]
1,the worst movie I have ever seen,"I am a HUGE Resident Evil fan but these movies are getting worse and worse. I cant believe someone produced this piece of garbage. Half way through I was so bored. The story is lame and hardly plausible even by zombie standards. No cool weapons or fights, no sex, no fear. Even if I was 13 I would think this movie sucked. It deserves zero stars for this abortion of a movie."
3,End of the Franchise,"This is not an awful movie.........the blu ray version is quite lovely.........but I think this should be the last in the series....it lacks originality, and the characterizations are now somewhat tired. As the actors go through their paces, I found myself less drawn into the drama than I was on the first three films. It is a reasonable action adventure, well shot, reasonably well paced...just sort of tired. Those of us who love the franchise may be somewhat disappointed, but still should buy this movie...if only for closure."
2,NOT ENOUGH ZOMBIES,"I love the RE series, but for me this one sucked. There was not enough zombie action, just slow motion stunts. No real action like in the other movies. I was bored and really disappointed"
3,I expected more,"movie is not good, but sound of this blu ray is amazing in my home theather. blu ray content is varied, but i was expected more..It has languajes and subtitles in english, french, portuguese and spanish."
2,"More like Matrix, Less like Resident Evil","OK so, yeah the storyline isn't all that mind blowing, but the effects usually are. I really enjoyed the first 3 installments but this was a HUGE disappointment. The writers/directors/producers made this film more for 3D than for the RE fans. This movie reminds me so much of The Matrix it was hard to find RE in it. Other than Alice, a few characters from the last installment and some zombies it bore little resemblance. I like Alice and some of the others coming back from the last installment but it's about time to delv into what Umbrella is and how this all began. Not sure I'll rush out to buy a next installment if there is one....Very disappointed........."
3,Uhmmm...not worth the 10 bucks and the headache that the 3D glasses gave me,"I loved the scenery, special effects and the fight scenes but the acting was abysmal. Everyone including Milla Jovovich, delivered their lines like they were reading the instructions off the back of a pregnancy test box. Some parts were unintentionally hilarious and ridiculous as well. Another thing that killed me was that they tried to inject characters from the video game(Chris & Claire Redfield) as if they are trying to be true to the source material. You already hacked up the original plot of the video game so why try to redeem yourselves with this mediocre mess now. All in all, it was decent enough to sit through but not as EPIC as it wants you to believe. If you just have to watch this, go at the matinée price or try like hell to get some free passes. 2.5 stars for me but would have been 3 if the acting wasn't so horrid."
3,3D Makes this just okay.,"I wish they had not made this is 3D. I have the Bluray non 3D version. There was so much attention paid to having a 3D effect it took away from what probably could have been much better seens. The story itself isn't they best of the series, but it's good. I only gave it 3 stars because of the 3D. I've seen other 3D movies that looked great in 3D, this just isn't one of them."
3,There's Always an Afterlife in this Series!,"The director who started it all returns for the 4th film in the cool series based on the video game.Paul Anderson directs a fun and action-filled film here. Definitely one of his best. Never boring, I have to say that.But the ending kinda pissed me off. Yeah, a couple of these movies ends with somewhat of a cliffhanger - but not like this one did!Worth the watch. And I hope the next one is bigger and better - both in action and in storyline and characterization."
3,Not good but not bad,"This was my first 3D movie. It was awesome to watch. There was plenty of action fromstart to finish. Milla and Al are hot. Wentworth Miller had an interesting role, I guess it will be fully developed in Resident Evil 5. Not enough Boris kudjoe, he had a great presence. Where is this film or series of films leading to? Very confusing at times"
3,Resident Evil,Resident Evil : Afterlife was pretty good movie I just can't wait for the New Resident Evil movie Resident Evil : Retribution which is the 4th Resident Evil Sequel.
2,slick action but not filling enough. depressing after first 8 minutes,I've never played the RE video games but watched this out of simple curiosity. The first 8 minutes was completely riveting and stylish. But after Alice left Tokyo the plot and cinematography bored me to death.I just kept waiting for something to really happen but was sorely disappointed. The ending was a let-down and I can't recommend this at all.
2,big resident evil fan. . . .,"But this sucked. Too much matrix-like movements the zombie mouths opened like in AVP --the aliens that breeded with predator, and basically boring story line. I didn't enjoy this as much as the previous movies."
4,If You Like Zombie Movies,"If you like zombie movies (as I do), then you will enjoy this movie. I am a fan of the Resident Evil movie franchise so I may be a little biased, but if your a looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie then this is for you. There are lots of things getting shot and getting blown up, especially in the opening scene. There are some returning characters from previous Resident Evil movies. My only minor beef with this movie is that it blatantly rips off the Matrix both with costumes and fighting moves. If you are looking for quality cinema that will be appearing on TCM for generations to come, this is not for you. If you just want to watch a fun movie with zombies and be entertained for a while, this is a good choice."
2,Good 3D but Boring,I got this 3D movie for more live action 3D options. Story line is a bore but the live action made it worth adding to my 3D collection. Recommended for the 3D but with reservations.
2,Review,"This movie was decent. I'm not a movie critic... but I would have to give it a 5/10. I really loved Resident evil 1 and 2. The 3rd one was just ok. If you're wanting to see it for milla jovovich, then it's worth it. She did a great job along with ali larter. The over-all movie plot had a bunch of kinks... renting it would have been a better choice."
4,More zombies.,"Initially I noticed that this movie got poor to fair reviews so I rented it first. This movie kept my attention from the beginning to the end. I was dissapointed that their was no clarification on the crab-thing on Clair's chest, and where were/are the rest of the kids from the previous movie. Unfortunately, Clair had amnesia and was no help in explaining a thing. I thought this was going to be the last one but they left the ending open. I hope they follow up with another one. Overall, not a bad movie. Seemed like the dead are getting smarter. ???"
2,Please Stop Making These,"It's got action, and that's about it. Stupid plot, ridiculous and unrealistic action scenes, and boring characters. Maybe instead of spending money on pushing the limits with 3D and more over-top-action they should just hire a decent writer."
2,Must watched the 3D version...,"I watched the movie in 3D when it was in cinema & I really enjoying it. After watching back the movie in Blu-ray (2D)... the movie is kind of suck. Resident Evil Afterlife is made for 3D... only in that medium I believe you'll enjoy this movie. Some of the moments look really awkward in 2D.However, in term of Blu-ray transfer... its AWESOME... the picture & audio quality are superb."
2,Not worth it,"I love the Resident Evil francise: The movies, the games, the story, everything. This movie was not very good. First of all, it went by so quickly that when the credits come up, you're left confused. The main climax to the story didn't seem so big so it makes you think there should've been more to the story. Definately not worth the purchase. If you feel like you need to see it, rent it. Sorry. I was really excited about seeing this, and it was nothing."
2,Not Good,This movie pretty much sucked like the rest of them... I love how they've taken a great survival horror game and made corny glammy action chick movies out of it (sarcastically speaking of course)... One thing that cracks me up is that it's a zombie apocalypse but everybody is well groomed and clean and all the girls have great perfectly brushed hair and make up looking all pretty and stuff... The resident evil movies could've been good but they ended up pretty much being a joke...
5,Great movie!,"Although it isn't as great as the previous ones, it's a great addition to the series. Milla Jovovoich is great and I couldn't picture anyone else in this part."
3,disappointed,Made a decent action movie that's not as good as the previous movies. It started well but just didn't feel like it followed through. The ending made it feel like the movie is just a stepping stone in the series. The movie only had one purpose that happens in the beginning of the movie.
5,The BEST 3D I have seen yet,"This 3D movie is outstanding! The special effects are unreal. I have seen all of the Resident Evil movies and this is by far the best quality. Typically, the movies are rather dark and take place underground but Afterlife features breathtaking scenes in Alaska. I was mesmerized!"
4,"Great 3D show piece,Great movie...But Kinda short","One of the top 5 or maybe top 3 3D Blurays to show off excellent 3D effects,it defiantly is a good 3D tv/3D BR player show piece. Its just a bit on the short side as it leaves you wanting more... If you can get it 4 a good price(I payed $25) I highly recommended it."
3,The Fourth Time Is Not The Charm,"Resident Evil: Afterlife is arguably the weakest in the series. Yes, it has action. And yes, it has zombies. But it has hardly any actual zombie action. Most of the action in this one is between humans. Bad guys vs. good guys. There's only about five minutes of zombie action in the whole movie, and it's awesome while it lasts. Unfortunately, it doesn't last very long. It's as if Paul W.S. Anderson didn't want to make a horror movie this time around, but a shallow action movie that rips off The Matrix series. There's also a lot of boring dialogue. Let's hope that if there's another Resident Evil film, that it has a lot of zombie mayhem."
1,Terrible movie,"I'm not going to say much cause theirs not much to say. But I will tell you that the live action RE movies went really downhill after apacolypse. Their's really no plot in this movie, just pointless mess. The acting sucks and they did a really good job screwing the live action series. Please don't buy this trash."
4,fan of the resident evil movies,i like this one as much as the rest. only thing is the plot was to short but still a great conclusion of the last.
2,Sad,I think extinction was the last good resident evil movie. This one they played into the 3D too much. It just feels really cheesy. As much as I love Milla Jovovich I think this is the last resident evil I'll buy. They just feel so cheesy now.
5,I arrived in excellent condition as quickly and everything has to be thanks,I think he deserves it for the reason that I get when expected and as we saw in the pictures and works as expected
1,JUST HORRIBLE,"I used to think you couldn't mess up a zombie movie. I was sooo wrong. This movie was actually hard to watch. Thank God it's over. The acting was so bad that at times I thought it was some sort of satire or parody. The story line was so ridiculous that I found myself spontaneously shouting, ""Oh, come on!"" frequently throughout the movie. I took me two days to watch. At the halfway point I had to rest as my senses were violated to the point of nausea."
2,No thanks.,"Cheesy, cheesy, cheesy. And I say that as a RE fan and a Milla Jovovich fan. Too bad, such potential."
2,I'm surprised they weren't fighting Shark-jumping zombies...,"I just watched it last night, and thought this was one of the cheesiest films I've seen in ages. Its obvious that 3D doesn't add much to a lame film..."
3,RE: Afterlife,This was a typical Resident Evil movie with predictable creatures and a typical cliff-hanging end.I think the could have done better.
4,Great Movie,Love the video games and was very exciting when the movies started to come out. The movies only follow the video game in some aspects but they are all still a good watch.
5,Action Packed,"Fabulous movie, I love this series adn so does my husband. Has alot of new graphics in ti but it makes sense and you never get tired of the series. Everyone should get in on this action."
5,thanks,thank you it completed my collection at the time. i will cherish this as i am a movie lover again thanks
2,ok 3D effects. ok story,"watched this Resident Evil: Afterlife on blu-ray 3D on my 3D TV. I think the 3D effect on this movie is ok and not as good as I expected (read some reviews saying how wonderful the 3D effects this movie offers before I decided to purchase this blu-ray). Another reason why I am disappoineted is probably because I watched ""Open Season"" blu-ray 3D the night before I watch the Resident Evil: Afterlife blu-ray 3D. ""Open Season"" has far better 3D effects. I know I am not supposed to compare an animated 3D movie to a filmed 3D movie but I can't help it as ""Open Season"" really has wonderful 3D effects."
4,resident evil afterlife.,"many have dofferent views about this movie franchise, but i must say its one of the well made parts of this series. milla kicks major zombie butt n this film just like the rest. worth a buy, or at least a rent."
3,Resident Evil: Afterlife,Not as good as some of the preceding ones but one that definitely fits with all the rest and continues the adventure.
4,Boris!.(K) .... ladies know that's allllll that needs to be said!....,"Um um um....go see it if for nothing else...the... ""Eye Candy"" (BK)....smile....Besides that....it's a really good movie, me and my son (18) went and had a good time..."
4,Resident Evil Afterlife,Great Movie. We downloaded it onto our kindle and watched it on our long plain ride. We liked this one and the one before.
5,"Wow! I love it so much, great in 3D","I really loved this movie when not in 3D and now that it is, it's even better. I'm just missing one out of the whole set. Watch out for those antique 3D movies out there, they come with glasses in a box and it doesn't work on your TV and the seller doesn't tell you."
5,Is it really over?,"Milla Jovovich does another excellent job in the role of ""Alice"". Are the humans ever going to get the upper hand? Will the Umbrella corporation and the zombies for that matter, ever be destroyed? Watch the movie if you do not already know!"
3,Resident Evil 3D review,"Decent horror movie , but, the 3D effects make this movie a must for showing off your 3D television.Your friends will want a 3D TV after they watch this movie on your TV..A must have for your 3D movie collection..."
3,The first one is still the best,"I am a huge fan of everything Resident Evil, but this movie was lacking. The first Resident Evil movie grabbed you and didn't let go. It was fresh and had plenty of action. This movie had a kick butt opening sequence and faded off from there. It was like the writer had a great idea for a movie (the beginning sequence) and then had writers block after that. I thought it was ok, but if you are not a fan of the series, I would just rent it."
1,Epic excrement,Utter garbage. Incomprehensible deus ex machina thrown about meaningless action sequences and CGI effects that seem like a bad high-school-video-club-Matrix-wannabe. If you don't regret spending money on this movie you deserve euthanasia.
2,disappointed,"It became obvious to me shortly into this movie that it is finally time to call a halt to the resident evil and move on to the afterlife. It has become such a bore that I had to struggle to remain awake during the running of it.I wish there was something more positive to say, but for me, it is a dud."
1,Bad Dvd,I don't think I will be buying anything from this group again And I would like to know what kind of quality control this group has because my dvd has a cut in it and the dvd skips through out the entire movie and I understand I bought this movie used but I also paid for one day shipping the dvd did get here fast but whats the point of owning a dvd that does this I plan on making a call tomorrow
2,Rent it for a dollar but don't buy this Matrix-wannabe,"Yes, this has plenty of action and special effects. Yes, there are attractive women (though you know the most attractive new character is going to get bumped off quickly, and she does). Yes, you know the big weasel is going to outlive most 'good guys' until he receives his final justice. So, no big surprises, and not a lot of sense, either. We know nothing nor care anything for these 'video game' characters (unlike, say, movies like ""Aliens"" or ""Road Warrior""). Instead of creating some difficulty and drama for our heroine, the movie decides that the now ""human"" Alice can still swing from tall buildings, shoot her way out of millions of zombies, and vanquish a 12-foot tall mutant Executioner. What's the point?The only good news for our future is that any females who survive a zombie apocalypse will apparently have a plentiful stock of eye liner, lip gloss, hair products and push-up bras."
2,Oh well...,"I thought it took too long to get interesting. I think that Resident Evil Extinction has been the best of the series so far. Some of it is starting to seem a little far fetched. I know I'm splitting hairs but I find it hard to believe they flew a helicopter from Las Vegas to Alaska without refueling. I love the series and I'll definately buy it on Blu-Ray when it comes out. You know there's going to be another installment from the way this one ended. Guys, take your time and don't rush it out, a little waiting never killed anyone."
4,"This was my ""Alien 3""","I love this franchise. The movies are action packed, fun and infinitely re-watchable. I feel the same about the ""Aliens"" franchise. As great as these franchises are, they both have one thing in common; one installment that is good but not great and doesn't really do anything except ride the coattails of the other installments. For me, ""Afterlife"" was that installment just as Aliens 3 was in that franchise. It was fun but it just seemed to be the first part of a whole. It's as if the movie they wanted to make was to long, so they chopped it in half with that big monsterous zombie axe and released it as a stand alone installment. I gave it a four because it is almost awsome. One thing I hated was the Matrix copycat scenes. Resident Evil is good enough that they don't need to copy someone elses decade old idea.Note: I did not see it in 3D so take that into account when reading my review."
3,Not the best one of the series but if you're a fan you have to watch it.,"Not the best one of the RE series, but if you're a fan you have to watch it. It's fun power chick entertainment. Don't expect more than that and you'll enjoy it for what it is; just get your popcorn, darken the room, and watch the sci-horror zombie fun unfold."
1,Horrific. Cheesey. Bad.,Poor acting and not even in a satirical way. Shallow plot with little to draw you in. Save your money and time.
5,Kevin Kicks,"I saw this years ago when it showed on HBO, it rocked. He does the BEST impressions and makes timely comedy about current events. Buy this tape and unless you have no sense of humor you will love it! Blake Clark was great too! Let's just say I was looking for a DVD when I found this tape and I WISH I could pay more to get a DVD but it wasn't available!"
5,Great information,"This is a well written book full of great information for women, as well as men regarding the hormones in our body and how they affect us. From fertility to menopause, Dr. Greene has laid out a comprehensive plan on eating, natural hormone replacement and exercise. He documents symptoms and case histories of out-of-balance hormones as well as the part they play in mental and brain functions. I would recommend every woman read this book."
5,more help than I had a right to expect,"This book is an excellent first step on the path of healing; that is the path of forgiveness. CT Coyle is an expert in the field of forgiveness therapy, and lays out a path to healing in these pages. It is still (nearly ten years after it was published) the best book I have found on the subject."
4,Award-Winning Afghans,I spent so much time trying to track down a pattern for cathederal rose afghan on the cover it just wasn't funny. I ended up finding a second-hand copy on Amazon. Some lovely patterns in it. Well worth it.
4,What??,"I've had this book for 7 years, and I never reviewed it? hard to believe. A must for the occasional repairman, so you can take it apart without a hammer and crowbar (not usually a good idea). I think I used this to find out how to rewire the electric door locks. They were unlocking themselves at odd times, like in the middle of the night. Not good. Turns out one of the transistors in the control module was flakey, so I just wired that lock over to another transistor (each door has its own). The transistor can handle two locks easy, it's been fine ever since (more than 6 years now). (You watch, now I've written this, it'll burn out tomorrow.)"
5,Enjoyable debut,"Don't confuse Innosense with that ""other"" girl group the Spice Girls. These new girls on the block show that with tight harmony, great beats and some style, they can take the world by storm.Standout tracks on the album include the haunting ""Rain Rain"", the Diane Warren penned tracked ""You Didn't Have to Hurt Me"" and ""A Hundred Oceans"", the old school R&B flavored ""A Real Good Man"" and the funky rap/chant vibe of ""Ride"". The album is a mix of today's ""pop"" sound, with a twist. They can take it from the mellow ""So Together"" to the cyberspace themed ""www.fan-ta-see"" without missing a beat. I was most impressed with the harmonies and arrangements within the songs, that's where they shine. I would reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a great pop/dance album. (and check out www.innosensemusic.com for clips of all the songs)"
5,Innosense rock!,"wow! i love this cd.innosense rock.their 1st album has 'say no more'(the 1st single),plus other great songs like 'beep beep','so together','rain rain','looking for a real good man',and 'www.fanstay'.but my fave is the next single 'this is it'.i love innosense and can't wait to see them in their mall tour this fall!"
5,this cd rox!!,"its finally here! ive waited so long for this cd and let me just say, it totally rox!!! go innosense, go innosense, go! you guys, if u love pop-r&b type stuff like nsync, u need to get this. innosense is like the female nsync!! support the girls and get the cd!"
5,WOW...an AWESOME girl group!!,"this cd is AWESOME..the songs make you feel good!! SOme of the best are: ""RAIN RAIN"" ""Ride"" is a fast paced awesoem song!! All the song sare good!! This one of the best albums this year so far!!"
3,Way over priced,"Had I known better, I probably wouldn't have payed over $20.00 for a lamp like this. I'm almost certain it was made in China as I believe all Kichler lamps are. Very cheaply made."
5,Love being able to watch these classic cartoons again.,"I just love the old classic Scooby Doo shows, and my daughters do too. I'd much rather watch these with them, then a lot of the poorly made cartoons out there now."
2,Not what expected,"Not the ""old"" Scooby Doo we expected...research before you purchase. Not a fan of the later Scooby Doo.that is why the lower review."
5,Great Show,Daughter loves scooby doo and she watchs this all the time! Easy to get to and easy to start so she can watch it. I would recommend this to my friendsOr to anyone you likes scooby doo!
2,This is not Scooby Doo Where are you?,"This is not the Scooby Doo Where are you series. This is the Scooby Doo show, which is a blanket for the series that ran from 76-78 as apposed to the original that ran from 69-70. The Scooby Doo Show that is contained here includes The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour, Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics, and Scooby's All-Stars. Which are in a different format than the original show.THis will either piss you off as it did me or you won't mind it."
1,wrong years,scooby doo season 1 i grew up with scooby doo it started in 1969 not 1976 as stated here. glenn beckett this is not season 1
3,Life is so Good.....my opinion of it,"Well, i was never really good at writing reviews on reading material, but i must say this book is a rather facinating piece of literature. It defiantly notes major social and econimic issuses very well as told by the author. I thought it was a pretty good book overall, and i reccomend it to anyone wondering what it must have been like to live throughout the century and witeness and be a part of all of the experiences of the 20th century."
2,Doesn't live up to its potential,"This book had such an interesting premise - the life of someone who lived through the entire 20th century. And the opening chapter is a riveting story of observing a lynching. But from there the book tends to be a mundane list of places George lives. How about some theme to tie it together? Also large pieces of time are just missing. OK, but could have been a lot better."
1,Wrong book,"I purchased this book as a gift for my bother-in-law. My sister is working with him on his reading. This was to encourage him but it turns out that they received the wrong book. Unfortunately, it is a little difficult for them to get the book back to me to return for a refund. I'm just out the cost of the book. I do not recommend purchasing used books from the third party vendors.I can't say I hate the book but I hate the service."
4,Great Book / Excellent condition,This book is great for all ages.My 8 year and 14 year old have read it along with me. Great book for the entire family.
4,A winner,"What a fine book this is about an extraordinarily decent man who worked hard all his life and never lost his positive outlook about the world and human life despite the challenges of poverty and racism. George Dawson, a 103-year-old slave's grandson, lived through the entire 20th century and at the age of 98 enthusiastically took on the task of learning how to read. The book's title, Life Is So Good, sums up his philosophy of life. This is the kind of book that makes one feel there is still some hope for the human race."
5,"wonderful, humbling book","This is a beautiful book, with a beautiful message. It was a gift to my husband on Father's Day from our daughter. We're all enjoying it. This author is an amazing man, a testament to the human spirit."
5,The most interesting book Iv'e ever read!,When my teacher said that we were going to read a book outloud I thought oh no another baby book! but when I heard the first chapter I couldn't wait to read the rest it was so exciting and to know that this really happened it was like taking a trip to a virtual tour through history! Maybe it isn't the best book ever. Maybe the fact that my PE teacher is the author inched me to think it was great I love it! When I heard that Gorege Dawson was coming to our school I was thrilled I even got to shake Goerge Dawsons hand! This book is probably the best book I've ever read! It's true.
5,A must read,"I absolutely loved this book. I read it in two days and it made me sob and laugh out loud. It's an intriguing perspective on the last century as told by someone who couldn't read until age 98. Mr. Dawson experienced injustice and hardship but never lost his positive and kind spirit - it's a great lesson. This book is a jewel and a great gift for Christmas. It should be required reading for high school students, in my opinion.Mr. Dawson, I wish I could meet you. Your book should be in Oprah's book club. Thank goodness Mr. Glaubman thought your life was worth sharing.Buy this book!!!!"
3,"Dawson awesome, Glaubman needs work","George Dawson had a remarkable memory. At over 100, he remembered minute details about his young life that added interest to his storytelling. I would have loved to listen to him just talk. The lower rating on the book is simply because of Glaubman and his inability to get out of Dawson's way. The irritations that nearly made me put down the book were all him. I understand that you are trying to mimic Mr. Dawson's voice, but when he says, ""I would've"", you should not spell it ""would of"". Every ""would of"", ""could of"", and ""should of"" distracted me. His grammar errors weren't limited to this. On page 201 when George credits his parenting success to common sense and love to, I wanted to scream. Love to? Love to what? Oh, you mean ""love too"". I'll bet George, reading at a 3rd grade level might HAVE even caught that one."
4,Inspiring.,"Similar to a Studs Terkel, only this whole book is by a 101-year-old African-American man, who learned to read at 98 (the book is co-authored and polished by Richard Glaubman, but it's Dawson's voice). Dawson's simple optimism is inspiring, especially in our cynical day and age. Demonstrates that whether a person's situation is good or bad depends more on his attitude than his actual environment. It's also inspiring to hear from someone who lived to see so much change. So often we ignore the voices of the elderly when it's those voices that have the most wisdom to offer."
5,Remarkable story,"A remarkable story about a remarkable man. People asked him how he lived so long. Their questions generally were about his diet. That wasn't his 'secret' to a long and happy life; his secret was his incredible ability to forgive. His father told him as a boy that he didn't have the right to judge another and never did he. What kind of person could live by his father's wise words? Only a wise man. George Dawson had every reason by today's sorry standards to be bitter, yet he never used the word 'racist', never blamed the white man, never demanded reparations or even asked for a hand out. He was, in a word, a success."
5,Life is So Good,This is a wonderful story of a simple but great man who was black and lived for over 100 years. There are many simple lessons to learn from him. It is told from the perspective of a poor black man who has dignity and there is absolutely no whining in this book. He never stopped learning and learned to read when he was 98. Although he was poor all of his life he has a lot of gratitude for the basics. Here is a poor man who had a rich life; likely having to do with his general positive attitude. This book is a good read and quite heartwarming.
3,A Great Read,"This is a book worth reading especially if you can't read yourself. While I was reading, a thought comes to mind of how great it would be to see Morgan Freeman as this guy. I know this is a great book and might be great as a movie too someday with Morgan Freeman as the star. You never know it might be great?"
2,"JUST SOMETHING """"FUNNY"""" ABOUT IT!!!","This was just an okay book. This guy lived longer thanI will ever see, that's for sure!!! But, the book itself, , , toughto read. Badly written?? Could be. Redundant?? Could be.Confusing?? Could be. I had a hard time finishing it."
5,A Joy to Read,"This book enlightened me and really got to me, much more than I expected. I was delighted to read about the life of a 102-year old african american man from the south, as I am a 30-something white woman from MT. He has a lot to teach us, and a lot to remind us of and has a way of doing so that makes us thankful for what we have. George Dawson is a gem and I am pleased that someone took the time to put his story on paper. What a great book!"
4,Inspiring,"The story of this elderlly gentleman touched my heart and is a great pass-along read. When you think you've had a tough day, read the first few pages and know what challenge and grace really mean. Wonderful, uplifting."
5,Don't HIt my Mommy,"the book is exceptional, easy to read. A good manual for people working with victims of domestic violence. a must have."
1,Laughable,"Well it would be laughable if it weren't for all the women who will read this book, and accept anything in the book as fact. What utter nonsense."
2,just ok,"I ordered 4 Batman animated videos - I found even the sound to be rather ""dark"" - not what expected. not very good animation in my estimation. doubt they will be watched twice by my grandsons."
1,CAN'T BELIEVE THESE REVIEWS !!!!,"I can't believe the greta reviews this album is getting. Listen, I'ma huge Priest / Rob Halford. I admit I felt chills into my spine when I bought RESSURECTION and heard Halford singing and screaming in top notch form after such a long time !! But this is an album you enjoy only once, the first or second time you listen to it. Then, it becomes clear how the songs here loose their appela fastly, you realize the album is boring, flat, the guitars are uninspired, the lyrics so silly (not even in Judas the lyurics were so silly!!!), the overall sound seems ""mass-produced"", with no feel or heart. And people came to me saying this is ""THE BEST METAL ALBUM OF 2001...?"""""" Are you joking guys. Please, learn to observe the difference between the admiration for a singer from the quality of his work !!!!"
3,OVERATED,"The reviewer called ""speed-racer"" must be joking. To say that this is the best metal album of 2000 ! I agree that Halford is singing very well. But compare this album with ""PAINKILLER"" ?!!! I thin this is a little bit too much for my taste. The sound is very flat ( typical Roy Z production , the songs are good, but ther's not one moment of real brilliance and inspiration by the duo of guitar players. It's formulatic album, produced by the same team that brought Bruce Dickinson back with amazing albuns. Of course it's better than the avergae garbage we've got nowadays. But I tell you: this no five stars album at all !!"
3,Just plain average,"I read the reviews and thought lets get this. I just do not see why people are getting worked up about this, and I cannot see the Judas Priest album comparisons people are making. To me this album sounds very like a couple of early UDO albums I have which I would love to offload to somebody, semi-fast and not particulary memorable, just compotent and average. In my opinion the two stand out Priest albums are British Steel and Screaming espicially considering when they were recorded. Painkiller is mentioned alot, this album is not a patch on it, to me this is UDO with Rob on the vocals. Finally, wishing for Rob to return to Priest and looking forward to buying the Halford live album, sounds good on the download some good Priest and Fight stuff on it. Lastly the first Fight album is a good album to buy."
5,Halford has done it again.,"This is one of the best metal albums in the last few years. Halford rips the ears apart with his hellbound sound. His new band is fantastic. There is no compromise on this cd, Halford puts the pedal to the metal and does not give an inch. Kudos on having Mr. Dickinson over for some guest vocals, what an added bonus for the metal crowd. Thank you for this wonderful album, I can't wait until the next effort."
4,A very good metal album,This album reminds me of CHemical Wedding with Bruce Dickinson in his solo career. IT has the same production by the same guy Roy Z. The vocals are amazing and for another time Halford prooves what a superb singer heis. If you like Judas Priest is a must as its an album that you will hear for many times .
4,Halford rules!,"I love Judas Priest but I've got disappointed with their ""Angel of Retribution"". If you also feel like this, you'd rather get this wonderful album instead. After some dangerous experiences in a projet called 'Two', the Metalgod presented us the metalfans with the miracle of 'RESURRECTION'. And there's another miracle in this album: the meeting of two gods: Halford and Mr. Dickinson Maiden singing together in the sixth track!! If you like traditional heavy metal, you've got almost everything here. Straight lyrics, riot, revenge, excellent musicians... That's a modern 2000 album that makes you go back in the 80's and remember the golden age of NWOBHM. The only thing I didn't like in this album was #7 song: the ridiculous 'Cyberworld'.Top3: Resurrection (01), Night Fall (04), The One You Love To Hate (06)."
4,Some really awesome stuff,"I had known about this album when it came out, but I wasn't interested at first. The previous Halford post Priest things didn't do anything for me - The Two project and something else. Then I caught Halford on the Iron Maiden tour 2000 and - oh man! It was awesome! The man still has his pipes - it's totally amazing. I went and checked out this CD a day or so after the show, and I should have gotten it sooner!There's some really awesome tunes on here - it's not the same musicianship as Judas Priest was (hence my 4 stars instead of 5), but it's by far the best thing he's released since Priest. If you were (or still are) a big Priest fan, you should check this out.My favorite track is ""Made in Hell"". Some great riffs there, and some great Halford vocals as usual!"
5,Resurrection Make Me Whole!,"What can I say? One of the all-time greatest CDs ever released. Rob Halford, the Metal God, forms his own very heavy, very powerful band. I have rarely heard such good music in my life. From the very beginning to the very end, this is a lot of walloping music. The title seems to make sense. When everybody though he was a washed-up old geezer, he springs back with the best album he has ever sung on! Some of the songs are kinda bizarre, like when he calls the Internet ""A Trojan horse that eats your mind"" in Cyber World, but nonetheless great. This is a must-have CD for anyone who calls themselves a headbanger."
5,metal god returns,It didn't take long to see if Halford still had it. The first track shows his voice is still the best in the metal world. 12 songs on this album with no real bad ones. A couple towards the end the lyrics are a little weak. Silent Screams is a classic reminiscant of (Beyond the Realms of Death) without the great solo. Rob hits many of his classic high notes thoughout the album and double up vocals are well mixed. Guitar work solid throughout the entire album. Next best thing to Glenn and KK. You may want to buy the import album for the two extra tracks. I've heard them and there both good.
4,Back to Bread and Butter,"This is Halford at his best. Unabashedly proud heavy metal. All the ingredients we love Mr.H for are here - Screaming guitars, Bombastic bass, Combustible drumming, good hooks, and of course ""THE SCREAM""."
5,I agree with the other reviewers,If you have never read Dave Barry this is a wonderful place to start. The guy is hilarious and while I can respect say Dennis Leary it is nice to read a guy who can be funny without swearing every 5th word.Highlights of this book includeDave Barry goes to ChinaDave Barry checks out GracelandDave Barry's list of the worst song everOverall-If you want to laugh get this now
1,"yeap, borring as hell I am not making this up also.","I learn from my experience if only a handful of people rated 5 stars don't believe it. I only read 15% of this book, and it is really really borring. I didn't laugh one bit. This book say if I am not laughing than I don't have humor. That's a lame excuse for a boring book. If this is really 5 stars, I can write a 10 stars book for people to laugh at intelligent and witty jokes, not stupid unlaughable joke like this book. But, Amazon is way cool, 5 stars bookstore. I have bought quite a few books (> 50) at Amazon, and I will continue to buy it. Recommend: I did laugh with for better or for worst by Lynn Johnston. Clean and witty whole some family jokes. Judy Carter is also very funny. These two ladies are way cool !"
4,Unique sense of humor and easy reading,This is an incredibly funny writer who is able to dramatise everyday events into a comical prose. Dave Barry had me laughing out loud in public places with some of the essays in this book. The only thing I would say is that this is one of those books that you can't read cover to cover...you need to take a break now and then before jumping back in.
3,Other Books,"A collection of amusing anecdotes from the American writer, humorist and columnist Dave Barry. He finds all sorts of weird, crazy, stupid and funny stuff that people do, say or come up with all across the United States of America, and puts them into print.Dave doesn't mind a drop of the droll, Dave doesn't."
3,I`d like to have more crime time,"Hellow everybodyI like this book because, the story is very real. But if i could, I would bring more excitement into this story. Perhaps a kidnapping from Mark.I have watched the film and I have read the short version of the story.I realised that there are some differences between book and film. An example is Reggie Love. in the film she is a young women and in the Book she is a 52 years old Lady.But at the end it was nice to read the client and I recommmend the book to all persons around this Planet."
3,"little boy, big troubles","at school i read the short version of ""the client"" .i like the books from john grisham very much because i like thrilling crimes.john grisham writes very simple and its easy to understand his stories."" the client"" is very typical for john grisham . there is always a case, a lawyer and the fbi. when you read all his books, they became boring. in ""the client"" i like reggie love. she is a very powerful lady in a heavy men-world.she says what she thinks and she doesn`t lie anytime to mark.mark is a very clever boy. i find too clever for his age."
4,Grisham has done it again!!!!!!,"....where does he come up with these great stories???? Mark Sway is a kid I can relate to. His character is so believeable, I even thought of kids from my youth. The characters are well developed and strong. Even the weak characters have a certain strength to them. If you enjoy anything that has to do with crime and justice,you'll love this. The story flows and has no unnecessary obstacles. INTERESTING!!!"
4,The Client Review,"I usually finish books fairly quickly, however, this one took me a little longer than expected. I felt it had a hot start, slowed down quite a bit, then ramped up again toward the end. I really enjoyed all the minute details Grisham includes...for me, it added a lot more reality to the story.The single most intriguing part of this story was learning allllll about Mark Sway. I found it amazing that Grisham could develop a character so well and expose so many different sides of him. He made it easy to visualize a story like this happening.. and made it easy to WANT to peer inside the mind of Mark."
4,Great book!!!,"I don't normally write reviews, but this is one of the best book I have read. I couldn't put it down!"
1,One of the worst novels from Grisham,"The problem with Grisham is that his novels are either very strong or very weak. I've read 10 or so, and the rule has never failed. This is one of the lousy ones, right from the outset. The whole thing is unloaded on you like a ton of bricks, in a clumsy and forced manner. The situations, the characters, the conversations have no credibility whatsoever. I cannot believe that such drivel comes from the same writer whose magical pen produced classic thrillers and political suspense novels. The stylish writing and the typical wit you've come to expect from Grisham are just not there."
5,The Client,This is another of John Grisham's books that I couldn't put down. I ordered the Kindle version and am extremely impressed by the ease of ordering and using Kindle.
2,can someone explain whats so great?,"I read this book and at first I was interested as to what he was going to do, but as it dragged on it got a little dull. The reason it got such a low rating was b/c the entire book is building up to a climax but there is no surprise at the end. Couldnt he be a bit more creative than just saying that Mark goes with the FBI? What about all those threats that the Mafia will kill him anyways? I mean that was the WHOLE book! SHEESH!"
1,"wrong genre, Grisham","Come on, now. A kid goes into shock for the entire length of the novel,just because he saw his big brother in a precarios situation? What kind of stuff is this kid made of? Does he wet his pants whenhe gets a bad report card? This and many other elements of The Client are the makings of a great fairy tale. but not serious fiction. The only reason I stayed with this one was to see if Cinderella and Snow White would make appearances."
1,You'll be mad if you read this book,"Caveat: I'm not a huge Grisham fan, so I'm sure some bias has slipped in here. But I think this book is just awful. While his other books are at least entertaining, this thing dies quickly after a semi-decent premise. The biggest problem is that there's only about 50 pages worth of story, and a writer with his minimal powers of description can't get away with hundreds of pages of fluff. Don't read this book--read Presumed Innocent instead."
1,Horribly boring.The only one laughing is Mr. Grisham...all the way to the bank!,"I'm three quarters through this. It's been a trial (pardon the pun) just getting this far. It's so unbelievable. An 11 yr old who can out smart FBI officials? Sure. A lawyer out just 4 yrs, with balls of steel? OOOOkayyy! Just give your readers a break John...this is dreadful! I enjoyed The Partner(except the ending of course- that hurt), and I also liked reading The Runaway Jury (lots of fun there), but this is just slow, painful and I think before the end I'm going to have to get myself a stiff drink...anything to help me wade through these last few chapters."
2,The Client fails to inspire,"The Client's story is a new twist on the contemporary thriller. The main protagonists are an 11 year old child with the wisdom of a cantankerous old man and a 52 year old female attorney who fights dirty to help society's most disadvantaged.A good, but uninspiring read with a lousy finish. Do they get the body? You will never know?"
