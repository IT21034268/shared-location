5,Thick Bottom,"Well made workhorse, I had some reservations about ordering this skillet, but it has been great having a very large skillet that I can easily cook an entire meal in. Very good quality for the price, I got it for $49.99 on sale here on Amazon. It has a nice thick clad bottom that spreads the heat well, even though it's 14"" across. The vent mechanism is poorly designed, but does work, that's the only critisism I have for this skillet/steamer."
5,perfect steamer!!!!,This steamer cooks food so evenly because it so large. I was so tired of cramming all my vegetables into my small steamer and expecting them to cook evenly. It even has a vent on the lid that you can open or close so that you don't have to keep letting the steam escape when you cook broccoli. This is the answer that I've been looking for after all the wasted money on other steamers. Highly recommended!!
3,Hard Easy,I Love David Boreneaz but I was disapointed with this one.The language was over the top for me.I don't recomend buying this one.
4,The Hard Easy,I enjoyed the movie it kept my attention through out the movie and I enjoy watching David Boreanaz.
3,A violent mess of nonsense,"The killing is so nonchalant in this HBO production that it makes the whole thing unbelievable. The plot is a silly concoction involving in two unrelated groups of crooks who decide to rob a diamond store, only they all show up at once. Numerous twists and turns later, everyone but two are dead. Which two? Well, wait and see."
5,The Hard Easy,I enjoyed this movie. Great to see David Boroneaz doing such a fine job he is always very believable in whatever part he plays and he should go far given the right breaks.
3,Rain hat,Hat was rain proof but the brim was not stiff enough to stay open in 20 mph wind. It would fold and catch on the hat so with wind and rain the had was not fully functional. Needed se way to keep the brim fully open to shield from the rain
4,Quality Rain Hat,"Very soft. Very comfortable. Good price. You can fold it up to pack, or stick it in your pocket if the rain stops. A must for fishermen, or anyone who may find themselves out in an unexpected rain."
5,"Dry, light & packable","Runs true to size, is light, packable and totally waterproof. My husband uses it for golf and I can't tell you how much it saved him at Bandon Dunes in Oregon."
3,A Decent Rain Hat,"Pros:Light weightCan be rolled up and stored in a bag or small placeWill keep your head warmCons:Low quality for the priceOverpriced by $15It may make your head sweat when it's warm outsideIt doesn't look like the crisp and well formed hat in the photosThe low quality and relative high price contribute to the 3 star rating. I still like the hat, but I don't love it. I wish I owned a version of this hat before they down graded its quality."
5,Great Hat.,"Bought this one to replace the same hat that I let someone borrow and they LOST! I had had the previous hat for over 10 years. Hiking, camping, cold or hot, great all weather hat."
5,Bought it again,"I lost my previous hat (kaki colour) on my last outing trip and now I have excuse to get new colour hat. It really shed off rain when I was on the trek in Nepal and keep you dry.For int'l shipping, it better to order individually. It packed in a box for 2 hats which doesn't required to do so, it can easily fill into a courier bag where it could have save up the shipping cost."
5,Great rain hat,"This works great for keeping the rain off when walking or working outdoors. Nice wide brim, snap up if needed, warm for cooler weather. I removed the chin strap as mine was snug enough without it."
3,"Still a good performer, but has dropped in quality","This is my second Seattle Sombrero. My first one I used extensively, as I do work in the field for my job in the Pacific Northwest. It always did what I asked of it; keep my head dry in all weather conditions. Unfortunately that Sombrero was stolen from my car, and since I found it so useful I had to replace it. My replacement is similar is most respects, but I noticed that these are now made in China, instead of made in the USA. Stitching accuracy is noticeably down from my previous hat, and the internal fit adjustment band was cut far too long. While my previous hat was a high quality garment that stood the test of time, I have doubts about my new one. While I have not experienced any catastrophic failures of my new Sombrero, I do not think that the level of quality now matches the price charged for these hats."
2,OVER PRICED for what you get.,It's a nice hat for moderate rain but it is really flimsy and way overpriced for what you get. If you want a real rain hat I suggest Grundens souwester. These things are awesome and well constructed. Best price I found was from LHS Marine in Washington state. The size runs a little small so I would get the next size up for comfort.
4,Rainproof,"I live in an area of the country that rains 5 months a year. The hat does as stated and is rainproof. The brim is large enough to keep the rain from your neck. The company backs it's construction for life, very cool. The only bone to pick is the fact that is you are a person like me and give off a lot of heat and moisture, the material does not perform as well as stated. Very small fact as comparred to the quality of the hat."
5,rain hat is great,I love the rain hat. I love the choice of colors it came in. It is comfortable to wear and really serves its purpose of protecting me from the rain. No more umbrellas for me.
5,Rain Hat,"Product arrived in prefect condition and on time. Great rain hat. I use this for hiking, walking, and for work."
1,not much of a hat,"I found this hat to be poorly made and rather ill fitting. Being rather misshapen, it barely resembles the photo. It has almost no weight or substance to it which might very well be considered to be a plus by some but in my experience you must keep the drawstring under your chin at all times if you don't want it to blow off of your head in the lightest of winds."
5,love this hat,"this is the second one of these hats i have owned, my original which i picked up way back in the early 90's has gone missing (grrr.. i loved that hat!!) thank OR, they still make'em! sweet hat and i look so good wearing it ;) oh, yeah, and its quite good at it intended job as a rain sombrero! ci ci."
5,Frighteningly Poignant,"I found Dr. Brugger's view of capital punishment and the Catholic view to be persuasive and articulate. I now consider the concept of capital punishment to be the greatest waste in humanity, perhaps only outdone by wrapping your Forest Green Porsce 911 around a tree.Dr. Bruggers views should act as a beacon to us all."
3,Good research--disconnected conclusion,"Sadly, all this excellent digging into Patristic thought culminated in simple maralizing about capital punishment. Citing the US Conference of Catholic Bishops should be a red flag to anyone interested in scholarship instead of policy. The talented author here found what the patres said but one must suspect that he did not penetrate their thought. The Holy Father knew intimately the thought of the earliest christians as well as the philosophy that surrounded them when he wrote about capital punishment. This book gets the information but not the sense of what led John Paul II to restrict the need for what today is considered drastic punishment."
5,Alain Chamfort,"Très bon disque qui nous replonge dans les débuts d'Alain Chamfort. L'album contient 4 cd, donc vraiment l'intégral des années 1966 à 1978."
2,"Quality of product is good, story sucks.","The quality of the actual book construction is quite good for a paperback book. That's the best thing I can say for this book. If you like really wordy authors that take about 10 pages to say what most would convey in 1 paragraph then this is your book! By the tme I concluded the 4 page description of the trees on the island, I had forgotten what Hearn was describing in the first place."
3,Watch the shipping charge,"Good product, fair price for a pair of gloves. Double the price when you have to pay the over inflated shipping price."
3,Great if not used for language,"I was a little disappointed by this one because I bought it mainly because it said ""French"", and I was disappointed because I thought the whole thing would be in the 3 languages referred to, when actually it is only 1 part where you can learn the translation of some words from English to French (or Spanish)I would think it is ok if English is your primary language, but bein French, and living in the United States, we wanted something completly in French to help our son immerse in French as much as he is immersed in the English languageOverall I think it's a great little educational DVD, just wasnot what I was looking for but it mght be great for you ;-)"
5,The G-man speaks:,"This is the very first American release by this artist and I cannot say enough wonderful things about his debut presentation.A former ladyfriend decided to appropriate my original copy and I felt fortunate to replace recently. (Thank you, Amazon!)The music is absolutely fanatastic as it shares his Japanase Heritage with his exceptional musical skills. The music is wide and varied but is a joy to listen to anytime. A wonderful example of this is ""A Warm and Sunny Sunday Morning"" as it providesa wonderfully up-tempo matched with equally wonderful vocals. Other tracks include both lyrical wonderment as well as very interesting instrumentals utilzing ancient Japanese intruments. I can compare it to the music played at your local Beni Hana's only; like your dinner, it is worth the price of the meal just to listen to this artist. Arrigato!"
4,"Mama, trains, trucks, prison, and getting drunk...","All of the songs on this CD are really good with the exception of this version of ""you never even called me by my name"" where DAC sounds a little stoned (or more than normal) and it misses the vinegar of the one on Outlaw."
2,Disappointing,"This CD is, in a word, disappointing. I bought it hoping to hear DAC sing some of his best with the same heart and grit that I remember from his old vinyl versions from the late '70s. Instead, what I got was something that sounded less like the Outlaw I remembered and more like what I hear from my kids' favorite singer, Raffi. Don't get me wrong, DAC does a good job; but his heart and soul appear to have gone as smooth as the Tennessee Whiskey he croons about. It's almost like he has sung these songs so many times that he is tired of cranking it up and just wants to lay back and relax. My advice: If you are going to buy DAC for the sake of old times, you'd better pick one of his older compilations."
4,Unexpected,"I bought this CD 2nd hand to hopefully find the extnded version of ""The Ride"" (where he rambles on about Nashville being filled with competition these days). Instead, much to my delight, I found this treasure trove of songs. None of these songs are studio recordings as originally released; they are all either recorded especially for this compilation or are out-takes and covers. The band is playing real tight but it is as if someone sat DAC down with a songbook and he went through it song by song. I really enjoyed the Merle Haggard covers. His take on Garth Brooks' song is masterful. Buy this CD if for no other reason than to have a unique version of his hits that none of your friends will likely posess."
1,Be Cautious,"Unfortunately this pillow was a waste of money for me. I had two issues which made it unusable:First, the smell never entirely dissipated and caused allergy problems for my husband. They claim that these are hypo-allergenic, but this was not the case for us.Second, this actually CAUSED me to develop neck pain. I've used cheaper foam pillows in the past with no problem, but something about this one wreaked havoc on my neck. I stopped using the pillow after about a month and the pain was gone in a week!This was an extremely disappointing experience, made even more so by Tempur-Pedic's refusal to accept returns and lack of concern with the issues caused."
3,You get what you pay for.,This is a cheap chair but it was cheap to buy. It's not quite as nice as the picture but it's function serves it's purpose and it works fine.
5,Nice spare chair for the patio,"I am very happy with this chair. I ordered three to keep handy on my smallish patio. I am going to keep them folded and ready to go off to the side so that I can keep most of the patio nice and open, but when we have larger groups for dinner, I can quickly make room for everyone. I am back to order the matching table."
1,Unnecessary,"The majority of hamsters do not need to be brushed. Long haired Syrians are one of the exceptions to this rule, but using a soft bristled toothbrush is just as good of an option. It's also a safer option for small children, as they are much less likely to hurt the hamster with a small toothbrush than a large brush bigger than the creature itself."
1,Never got it . . .,"I purchased to waterproof case for my new iPod Classic a couple months ago, and it never came. I was really excited to get it, and I kept tracking it. When it still didn't come I decided to stop checking every second in hopes it would come soon, but I forgot about it. So I just remembered it today, and thought I would ask about it. I got it cheaper because I got it from a different seller than amazon, but I got it through amazon. I don't remember who the seller was that I got it from and when I check my order status, it doesn't show up unless I search for it. After searching for it, if I click on a link, it will go to a different order I placed. I suppose this doesn't really count as an idem review, but i need to know how to contact the seller if it doesn't say who i got it from. Thanks:)"
3,Design Flaw,"I bought this strap for my sister's violin case...I deducted 2 stars because the design is stupid. Although you can adjust the length of the strap, you can only adjust it on ONE side. This creates a problem because now the shoulder padded section is not centered. They should of made the shoulder pad movable (like I've seen on some messenger bags). So if you want the shoulder pad to be centered just don't adjust the length. I kind of wished the shoulder pad had more cushion. If it wasn't for the design flaw this would of been a pretty good strap. This strap seems more comfortable than some of the other straps I've seen in local music stores."
4,All around good book,"If anyone ever reads this, and hope somebody will, this was a good book. It's a little slow at first and i'm not sure what the begining has to do with the rest of the story, but I still enjoyed it. It was just a good, short book for anyone's reading pleasure."
2,Principels,Definitely not written for the layman. It seems to be written more for seminary students or those already well educated in Lutheranism.
5,"Wonderful, inspirational book, no matter what your faith!","I recently became a fan of Fulton Sheen after seeing an old broadcast from the 1960's. This book only enhanced my warm feelings toward this witty and hilarious archbishop.If you have never read anything by, or even heard of this man, I would definitely recommend this as a first reading. It's short, but the message within these lines speak volumes."
4,Keys to hapiness,"This is the type of book that will draw you back time after time. We all have doubts at some time in our life. Bishop Sheen helps to identify the reasons for some of our unhappiness and then outlines methods to overcome our barriers. It is simplistic in it's content and short in length. Everything he says seems to fit. Then again, his college degree was in philosophy. When you combine that with the spirituality gained in studying for the priesthood, you have a powerful tool to help with the everyday ups and downs. Once again, a religious base is necessary to really benefit but even people with no religious tradition can be helped."
1,NO Workout included,"If you are looking for a workout routine, skip this DVD as it is absolutely worthless. This was not even a good instructional video. This looked more like a video introduction/sales pitch for the book. There are no workout routines, no instructions for jump rope technique, just repeated video clips of someone jumping rope and repeated request that you ""see my book"" for complete instructions. The only good thing is that Amazon allowed me to return this."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this video looking for a workout. It was more instructional, I did learn a couple of things. But, if you are looking for a workout to follow, this is not it."
5,Rediscovered the Jump Rope,"I hadn't jumped rope since I was a kid, when some friends told me it was a great toning workout. I browsed videos on these workouts and picked out this one, and I have been very satisfied. The results I've gotten so far are what you could expect for only a few minutes a day, but it's definitely been adding up."
2,Not Windows 7 Compatible,This software is not very compatible with any operating system. First thing I had to do is delete my current version of QuickTime. Then I deleted the Disney software and re-installed it. I tried installing on my Windows 7 laptop it wouldn't work so I finally installed it 2X on my desktop with XP. It's great learning software it just needs to be more compatible to and not bug up.
4,Core Rules 2.0 Expansion is GREAT!,"When I purchased the original Core Rules 2.0, I was sorely disappointed that you could not create custom classes. The wait for the expansion was worth it! The program gives users the flexibility to create virtually any character class they can think of, and it is dynamic enough to allow users to enter their favorite published classes as well. For Dungeon Masters who have created their own world, the expansion is an invaluable tool. The most disappointing feature is that the manual is very limited and gives you very little useful information; however, if you spend some time digging around in the on-line help files, you will be well served. I'd love to give this product five stars, but there are a few quirks/bugs/etc. remaining - once those are worked out, this product will most certainly be a five star product."
2,Holes,"There are major holes in this software if your doing any of the TSR campaign setting. It doesn't cover gods and the kits can be a pain to fit in. The software has limits on how well things are linked up. If your running ""Plane Scape"" or ""Ravenloft"" don't waist your time here. You can add the races and classes for these settings but the time it would take you to add these races isn't worth the effort. Crack the books open.With that said here are the good parts. You can make new monsters, races and classes. You can do some mapping and you have all the core books. I don't know about a lot of you but I'm not looking forward to 3rd edition. This product gives you the core books on disk so if you want to play 2nd edition you have them forever. We all know how well the TSR books are made. Any one remember ""Unearthed Arcana"" I do."
3,A great value but where are the pictures?!!?,"A great value, when you consider that in the ""good old days"" us non-cyber DM's had to buy all of those books in their hard-copy versions (expensive!!). BUT...... now I love the pictures of all the monsters, but there are no other illustrations--none! As far as the decorative one in the Player's Handbook or DM Guide, who cares, but let's say, for instance, that you are perusing the arms and armor guide, and want to see what a ""Glaive-guisarme"" looks like (???). There's the description in the text, but no picture! The book had the picture--I know, 'cause I own it! So.... that's my only criticism. Otherwise, a fantastic DM's aid!"
4,Excelent Material again but stills full of bugs,"Evermore and TSR bring us again excelent material for our games. But it stills full of bugs. Ok, you can fix it with a patch, but is that what are you paying for?. Oh! Graphics! remember when we open a Players handbook and saw all those beautiful arts? Well, no more with Core Rules. They should improve this.Nuevamente Evermore y TSR nos traen excelente material para nuestros juegos. Pero sigue lleno de bugs. Ok, se puede arreglar con un patch pero ¿es eso por lo que estamos pagando? Ah! Graficos! ¿se acuerdan cuando abríamos un Manual del Jugador y veíamos esas hermosas ilustarciones?, Bueno, eso se acabó con Core Rules. Deberían mejorar eso"
2,"Worth it if it was free, otherwise don't bother.","While the addition of ""true"" kits and customizable classes was great, and the addition of HTML books was a much needed improvement; All of this *SHOULD* have been a part of the original CR2, this expansion was nothing more than the money grubbing TRS and WotC trying to bilk us of our money!"
3,A great compilation-only the books in it aren't too useful..,"If you hate yourself for not being able to afford all the AD&D books, this CD does a good job at calming you down. Now sit and think - are half of those books as good as they should have been when they were printed the first time?"
4,"a3 Night Runners, A Big Hit!","Altough the a3 Night Runner is not well publicised, it is a very good product, and stands up to all standards. It is very easy to run in and looks great. My Pair of Night Runners Lasted for 7 Months, you should for sure look into buying this product. Hats of to Adidas for making such a great shoe."
3,Good reading,"I thought this was a very good work due to the fact it emphasises balance and the importance of full and dark moon rituals. Before reading this,I only did full moon rituals. Now I have incorporated her wisdom into my own practice. As a result, I do have a better sense of balance. Im giving it 4 stars because I feel it is slightly repetitive from the last book."
3,quite impressed,"I actually read this book *before* reading Green Witchcraft I (couldn't face another beginners-guide-to) and was quite impressed. As a Witch working very much in the folk tradition, and often with the deities often thought of as ""darker"", it was a good find, particularly the sections on the Goddess and God. However, the latter part of the book seemed rather jumbled. It contained a lot of good ideas, but could probably ahve been put together better."
5,The title says it all,This Book is a detailed description to understand the light (White magic) aspects of Magic and the (Black magic) Dark aspects of Paganism. In order to accurately understand what your doing and why or if you need to seek out balance and understanding of both sides. Read this!
5,Some great performances,"I can't get over how good PJ's voice sounds on this DVD . She sounds better live on some of these then the studio versions did . If I had a minor complaint , it would be that I personally would have liked to seen more complete versions of some of the songs & not just the bits & pieces offered . But really , if you're a fan already , you know you'll love this ."
2,Disappointed...,"I love PJ Harvey and have been listening to her for about 12 years now, I was SO excited when this DVD came out...what a disappointment.The live footage isn't very high quality, some of it almost looks like it was filmed with a camera phone!??!...the interviews are alright, but all in all I don't think there was as much thought put into this as there should have been considering how great it finally was to have some PJH to play on the TV!"
4,Nice puzzle,My son loves this puzzle and it keeps him busy for quite some time. It is pretty thick compared to other puzzles we own and has a lot of pieces.overall a good puzzle for the price.
5,Easier than searching department stores,"Convenient, quick delivery. Hard to find 100-piece puzzles, and this one was less expensive than other M & D puzzles by almost $3.00."
4,Shark Puzzle,I bought this puzzle to play with my grandson - he loves it. I will definitely buy more Melissa and Doug puzzles.
1,52 pieces in a 100 piece puzzle,"I gave this puzzle to my nephew. As my niece, nephew and I were trying to put this together and got no where after a long time, I counted, there were only 52 pieces included, almost half the pieces were missing. I don't know where the problem occurred, melissa and doug, amazon, I don't know..... but it was a waste of money."
5,Love Melissa and Doug!,This is a great puzzle. My son loves sharks and the ocean so he really enjoyed doing this puzzle. It is a great puzzle to do with your child as it is a little more challenging for my 6 year old.
3,It took a very long time to come.,"It took a very long time to come, though this may have been due to an extraordinary amount of snow this winter."
4,New Perspective on British Slavery,"Many books and movies focus on what slaves in America had to go through, but this book allows us to look at the experience of a slave who came to America to visit, but whose primary experiences of slavery were in Britain. Since the British abolished slavery decades before the U.S. did, people tend to forget that they were part of this terrible aspect of history too! Good for broadening your understanding."
3,ok book,"Not much to say. Sometimes fascinating, often times tedious and annoying... don't just read it for readings sake. Vassa... or is it Equiano will surprise you in the end.And he might not even be the true author!"
4,"An early English novel, with a twist.","This book has less to do with slavery and more to do with the quest for middle-class status in England. For comparison, one should also read ""ROBINSON CRUSOE"" by Daniel Defoe and ""PAMELA"" by Samuel Richardson."
5,Necessary for those grieving,"CS Lewis' book truly explores the ""tough"" issues of grief -- the questions of suffering, why God would inflict death on a good person, and the nature of God. These are questions that many people have when they lose a loved one. This book travels that path...and helps."
5,A Powerful Exploration of Grief,This book explores the tough questions on grief with candor and humanity. It confronts the tough issues surrounding loss and provides an approach to going forward. Worth reading more than once.
4,A Grief Observed,I read years ago the Screwtape Letters which was very informative and great regarding the works of Satan in our lives and so true. This book has many pearls of wisdom and insight and very relevant regarding processes we go through when losing someone we love.
5,Wonderful!,This is the best book ever written to comfort surviving partners after the death of a spouse.Dr S E NeilClinical and Family Psychologist
4,a grief observed,"the book was helpful on grief. to watch someone go through grief, i knew i was not alone."
4,Helpful for working through grief,I recently gave this to my grandmother after my grandfather passed away. It really helped her work through her grief as well as her anger at G-d.
2,Very disappointed,"Not too much was insightful or original in this book. It seems like the same old trite cliches that have been used before to describe death. I t deals with the ordinary issues of death: Pain, suffering and how to cope with those issues as well as coping with your own mortality. Grief, sadness, heartache and coping. I found this book awfully unoriginal, dreadfully boring and quite unengaging and unappealing. Giving this book two stars is only because the writing was superb. The author articulates emotion so vividly and well. Very realistic. Every emotion was described in detail. I almost felt like it were happening to me, but it was too unrealistic, which was disappointing. Relating to this book is hard however. An interesting, but unnecessary read."
5,An insight into emotional trauma by someone who is there.,"A Grief Observed is probably one of the most emotionally gratifying books I have ever read. Famed apologist C.S. Lewis lays bare the heartache, anger, and guilt that come with and after the sorrow of an immense loss and anyone who takes the journey with him will learn much about this brief yet eternal path we all must walk at one time or another. An essential in any library, highest recommendation."
1,a Grief Observed by CS Lewis,"For CS Lewis fans I will be slaughtered by this review. I absolutely love ""The Chronicles of Narnia"". Every single thing about it. Recently my son was killed in a tragic accident and searching for some type of comfort I ordered this book. I read this book, I read it very slow to make sure nothing was missed. This book rambled on, with meaningless sentences, very complicated hard to read pages and at the end of it, I had learned nothing except he truly loved his wife and she suffered until the end of her life, and it is his thoughts of her after her death. There was not one single thing I could apply to my own life or use as something to comfort others. The bottom line for me is 1} I would not read it again 2} I would not buy it as a gift for someone enduring grief. sincerely, r. jeansonne"
3,God is Good???,"A Christain apologist trys to reconcile suffering with the idea that ""God is Good"". It doesn't quite do it for me."
4,Interesting Perspective,"The language of the day makes this little book a bit cumbersome to read. However many of the points made in it were ones that mirror my own experience as I walk through the grief process of losing my husband and soul mate. I thought the preface gave interesting information about the author and his relationship with ""H"". The used price for this book made it a good purchase for me. I am not sure I would buy it new unless I wanted it for a permanent library. I am on my second read of it and I have found that to be beneficial for me, as I am picking up new insights. I'd recommend this if you are grieving and you like to read or if you are studying the author. If reading is not your thing I would probably bypass it because of the writing style."
4,Grief,"C.S. Lewis was a wonderful ""deep"" writer. This book gives you a look into the pain of a love one passing away and how you question during very hard times, ""where is God in all this mess"". Although there is so much that runs through your thoughts and emotions, there is a calm to the storm if you keep seeking God through it all as I observed through the grief journal of C.S. Lewis."
5,A Grief Observed,"C. S. Lewis takes the reader through the emotions and rathioalizations he expierences following the death of his wife. His journey was not an easy one. I, too, have suffered the loss of a spouse and in so many ways I could identify with Lewis' stuggle. It was comforting and helpful to me to read of another's struggle with grief and how he coped with confilcting emtions and thoughts."
4,Real Insight Into the Grief Struggle,"I felt like I was reading C.S. Lewis' unedited stream of consciousness, which is why I loved the book on one level but it was also hard to sort through at times. Lewis is vulnerable about his questions and struggles; he wrestles openly with God. It is a gift to read a prolific Christian writer journey openly through his hardship."
4,Interesting Glimpse at Lewis the person,"First of all, I should note that I read an older edition of the book without the forward.Some reviewers have noted that the book helped them through grief while others felt otherwise. I will leave those opinions to be discussed by those who have had more experience with them and will consentrate on the book's revelation of Lewis as a person.""A Grief Observed"" is at times a powerful and emotional look into C.S. Lewis's grief after the loss of his wife to cancer. Lewis had seen suffering before, he had lived through the Western Front in WWI, but Gresham's death may have been the greatest blow of his life. His journal captures some of his reconsiderations of faith, inner sorrow, and finally a return to faith. Overall a concise and interesting personal story of dealing with grief."
5,A masterful look at the world of self and speculation.,"As the other reviewers stated, this has more in the way of home truths and comfort than most books I have come across.I already knew Lewis, from reading the 'CHRONICLES OF NARNIA' as a small boy.It exudes the same, glowing kind of warmth you get when you sit down at an open fire, after trekking in from some cold and far away, emotional place.I recommened this to anyone who needs reminding who they are and why they're here."
3,A Grief Observed,"Excellent character study, but it is poorly written. Understanding the author is difficult but well worth the effort"
3,jjbrent,"Though I am a fan of CS Lewis, I found his meditation at times unnecessarily abstract, at others repetitive or self-indulgent."
2,Goju Ryu 03:Essence of Karate,"Higaonna greatly underachieves with this tape which has the potential to be a valuable addition to the martial artists video library. It is, however, sadly incomplete. The impression is little effort went into this production which simply shows the master punching and kicking at his student, who theatrically flails around. There is no explanation of any of the keypoints of execution of the techniques. I would say the tape is ""interesting"" but the customer absolutely is not getting value for the money. Not recommended."
3,not as good as i expected,"i was expecting alot from this tape because i am teaching myself karate. the production was ok, but the moves wern't effective enough and i didn't see the key points for the punches. the both of them were tired; it was like they shot the film in two hours with no brakes.But no doubt they show almost all the strikes and punches and the way they are used. in total, it is a good tape but it is not worth the price."
3,i liked it more than the child,"i loved this book - but, it doesn't hold our child's interest now - i put it away and will show it to him in a few months again."
5,abstract delight in the farmyard,"I love this book--it's beautiful. This book is a delightful romp through the farmyard, with goose leading the way across the pages as she chases a butterfly, causing the ruckus with all the animals. The abstract artwork truly appeals to adults and, therefore, may be too difficult for very young children to comprehend: the pigs in the muck, the kittens in the hayloft, the pigeons in the rafters all might be a little tough for a baby to distinguish. But a parent rereading the book several times in a row will appreciate seeing Fleming's gorgeous art each time. My nine-month-old son reacts to the colors with glee and my imitations of the animals with laughter--this is definitely one of his favorites. I highly recommend this book."
4,Love the system,"We have 3 dogs. Our 13 yo shepherd/collie mix has had the same collars for many years and it's still great. We adopted 2 large mixes this summer and at 8 months, they've broken one of the plastic clasps, so after 2 months we already have to replace the red collar part. Other than that, we've been very pleased with the ability to adjust the strength of the correction to suit the dog's personality and all 3 dogs stay in the yard now. We are even able to let the puppies out without a collar - we rotate the remaining good collar back and forth between them until we can get the other fixed. Take the time to train them to the collar the right way and you shouldn't have any problems. They know the beep and the flags and they understand what they mean. Trauma free, stress free, and free to run in the space we have."
5,Perfect.,Product arrived within time described. It was new and in original package. Nice to have saved almost $30 dollars. The price savings over PETCO and PETSMART makes this a no - brainer!
5,Beat store prices,Wonderfull item. Purchasing this on Amazon.com saved me almost $50.00 from the price given to me at a store. Item came with an extra long collar which is great to adjust the width for the commodity of my dog. If in the future I have purchase the same item I am definatley buying from Amazon..Great quality..
5,collars,Items were as described and the most reasonable price I have seen! Recommend to future buyers! Easy to do business with!
4,works well,"This purchase was an addition collar to go with an existing box. They work very well. The beep lets the dog know when they get close to the perimeter, so they do not usually get shocked more than once. Only downside...batteries do not last too long."
3,x,"Is very effective in what is does, very simple device that anyone can make, but is grossly over-priced. I would think the manufacturers would consider their customers by getting the pricing to a more reasonable level..., but what do I know.."
3,To expensive,This is way to expensive! Yes it works GREAT and it does exactly as its suppose. It keeps my dog from taking off or going after other animals but to much money.
5,Go Wireless,"No wire to put in the ground! This product works great. It takes a little adjusting and with two people (one inside and one out) it is a snap. We have a golden and she did not need much correction. Prior to the collar she would run after cars, now she knows her boundries and is safe.Highly recommend!"
5,Great Collar-Greater Price!,"We own several acres, and putting a fence structure around our property is not an option. The PetSafe Radio Collars are the perfect option to keep our pets on our property. Used with the radio base, the collar warns the dogs before getting too close to the ""boundary"" signal. The only problem is that only one collar comes with the radio base. Having more than one dog means you must purchase additional collars.Purchasing new collars can be expensive. Our local pet store wanted $40 more than the price I purchased here!My collar arrived very quickly, and in perfect condition. It worked beautifully with our radio fence, and I can rest peacefully knowing all my dogs are safe and sound, and not roaming our neighborhood."
3,confused,"I know 2 people with this system and they love it. One moved home and I was lucky enough to have my dog put on her system. Both people's batteries always have lasted 3 months, mine 1 week. This resulted in a dog missing for 2 days, when found was hurt, and then a trip to the vet. My dog is back in the pen. Both people I know who have this system think it's great and it has always worked perfect for them. Maybe my collar came with a cheap brand of battery that should have been replaced immediately."
3,We loved this until..,"We have had this unit for over 2 years and it did a wonderful job training our dog to remain in our yard. Recently though, the base unit failed and our dog was repeatedly shocked and traumatized. My wife was bitten as she struggled to get the collar off. Not good. The company was responsive and replaced the base unit and power cord. Everything was good until the collar went off by itself recently. Fortunately, it wasnt on the dog. I had just removed it in the house less than 20 feet from the base unit. It beeped and zapped by itself. I can't really trust this system anymore. Customer support said to not use it in the house, and that wireless devices could interfere with it. Not a good answer."
1,Very disappointed!,"We spent the money to get collars for our golden retrievers that kept wanting to leave our yard and go to the creek for a dip and they don't work! Our dogs just go past the point and keep on going. Doesn't seem to bother them much. We thought this was a great idea so we could save $4000 on a fence, well it looks as tho we may have to spend it after all!"
5,Your dog will not stray!,This is an effective device to allow your dog(s) freedom while providing them with a large safe area.We can leave both dogs outside for hours on end if we need to run errands. :-)It is well made and durable.
5,great upgrade from older versions,"We bought this wireless system a few years ago to control our enormous, willful dogs who jump our 4.5 foot fence like it's not there. However, the original collars were not very compatible with the aluminum siding on our house, and would shock the dogs randomly while they were within the allowed area. These new collars are a great upgrade on the technology. They have not gone off once when they shouldn't. Our wireless system now works exactly how it's supposed to; no burying wires or worrying about what happens if/when we move to a new house. This is also such a great thing to take on vacation. The dogs get to run around without us having to worry about them getting lost in a strange area. Love this product."
5,Collar really works,Works great. Be careful to start on the lower settings or else your pet may have a bad experience and not leave the house for fear of being zapped!!
1,Not good for dogs,"My dog got shocked once during training, on the lightest setting, and was terrified of us for weeks as a result. For almost a year after that experience she would avoid anything red - the color of the flags we used to do the training. She's a rescue dog, so there was likely some excess baggage from previous owners, but this experience set our training and progress back months. Do yourself and your dog a favor and never, ever buy these things, especially if your dog is even remotely sensitive or nuerotic. I quickly returned it and that process was a nightmare in itself...not Amazon's fault. I'd give this zero stars if it were an option."
5,Sweet!,I got exactly what I needed for a great deal! Product was shipped fast and accurately.. Thanks so much!
1,does not work,"said it would work with invisible fence, but does not. I thought it was compatible but does not even beep. Waste of time and then to late for a refund."
1,collar doesn't last,We put this collar on a cocker spaniel and six months later it is broken. The black box is gone because it broke off of the collar.
4,Pretty good.,"I have two dogs, this has worked on them great. Although, my little dog did figure out that if he was out of range for 15 seconds the shocks would stop. He would endure the shocking and then roam free....smart little turd."
4,Works great,"Have a 2 1/2 year old beagle who was always getting out of the fenced in yard. This works great. I can have him outside without worrying about him leaving the yard. Downside is the batteries do go fast sometimes without much notice. Also, does anyone know of a collar that would work with the wireless system that also has a bark control? As I said I have a beagle who loves to bark as much as he likes to run."
2,Unit works fine - Poor design/craftmanship,"The unit works just fine, however only two week after having it on our Great Dane, we came home to find the collar was still on our Dane, but the unit was not. Due to heavy snows we did not find it till 3 weeks later....laying out in the yard. The probes were missing...must not have been secured in the unit very well. It was a high price to pay for Now we have a nonfunctional unit and a collar."
4,very quick delivery,"Unit works nicely with my transmitter, but I would suggest getting the unit for ""stubborn"" dogs if you have a dog with a lot of hair (golden retriever) or just plain stubborn!"
4,Work great-cheaply made,"As most dog owners know, dogs are distructive which is why I'm so suprise how cheaply these are made and how many parts they have. There is a tiny cover over part of the electronic collar that my dogs have managed to lose. Without it it is not longer waterproof. The collar it self is nylon that my black lab puppy has no problem chewing off the other dogs. My sister has this same system and she poked holes for the receiver into a stronger collar. The system works but like everything else these days the quality could be better. If you have smaller or medium sized dogs that don't wrestle and play together none of these issues will probably concern you. PetSafe does have a replacement parts kit to buy the tiny cover so I must not be the only one that has lost them. This kit is hard to find...I'm sure most retailers would prefer you buy a new collar than fix your old one."
5,Short and Full of Information,"Galbraith's book is short and to the point. The book is ideal for someone that would like to learn about speculative bubbles without having to spend a lot of time reading through a larger book. With some dry humor he starts off with The Tulip Mania in Holland and ends with the 1987 crash on Wall Street. Galbraith has a unusual writing style, but does a good job of showing the common characteristic of all bubbles. I cannot over emphasize that this small book will show you the fatal flaws of bubble dynamics and their aftermath,in which the authorities and public search for scapegoat's and reason's for the bubble popping. Any reason will do as long as it is external of the market and the public remains blameless. Galbraith makes this point several times. A easy to read book that will be good for quick and future reference."
3,Engaging but superficial glance at financial euphoria,"This short, engagingly written book is a welcome antidote to the unfortunate and even dangerous stock market euphoria of recent years. Galbraith, as usual, is accurate and fair. The only problem with the book is that is that it never dives below the surface. Galbraith, like many left-wing critics of capitalism, has a keen eye for interesting facts, but he has little if any theoretical sense of the basic economic principles involved in market euphorias. It is gross credit excess that is fueling the current stock market bubble. The obverse side of credit is debt, and that is precisely where the problem rises. As credit expands, debt expands with it, especially bad debt. Eventually, the bad debt leads to a crisis; if a sizeable amount of debt cancellation occurs, you get deflation and a crisis of epic proportions."
4,"A short, concise review of history with a message.","Galbraith makes the case that we are somewhat doomed to endure frequent market collapses. A dose of reality, especially timely these days."
4,Ok,"Lets say the first review on this page is stupid, for one, Slapstick is not emo, they are Punk-Ska. And you can't get this cd anymore because it is out of print. So the only way you can get it is from being used or a friend. I gave this cd 4 stars because it gets old after a while but still the same great Slapstick music.Check out my other reviews"
1,Man In The Middle,"The message in this song is outstanding. However, I disliked the CD because the quartet group that really introduced this song to the public is the ""Sons Of The Soul Revivers"". Although never recorded by them, its pretty well known throughout the quartet community that the song is the Sons song. It is a heavily requested song at all of the Sons concerts who do a much better rendition.Listeners should check out the Sons latest CD entitled ""Help Me Lift His Holy Name"""
2,The beginning of a low period for Lou,"Lou's first Arista album was an unfortunate harbinger of things to come. This was probably the dumbest album Lou Reed ever wrote; the lyrics are abysmal and the music is bland.It's just impossibly stupid. Not stupid in an entertaining way, like Iggy Pop or the Ramones; stupid, as in continuing to wear your polyester leisure suit to public functions and thinking you actually look good in it.""Temporary Thing"" is the only song on here that's any good; to be honest, it's the only song on here that I remember. Lou's done a lot better than this. In all his time on Arista he would only turn out one certifiably good record, and that was ""Street Hassle."" This isn't as awful as ""The Bells"" or ""Growing Up In Public,"" but it's not much better."
3,a diamond in the rough,"to all my fellow Lou Reed snobs...yup, some of these songs do bite the big one, no disagreement whatsoeverhowever...there are some very good tracks on this LP...and some excellent musicianship -my personal ""diamonds' to check out, again...in no particular order:-vicious circle-temporary thing-chooser and the chosen one-senselessly cruel-follow the leader-rock and roll heart"
5,Exercise on a mini trampoline,For me this is a great way to lose weight. I am 71 and can exercise at my speed. It is great.
2,The Smart Bounce - Beyond Basics,The exercise routines are ok. The reason I am giving only 2 stars is because the CD itself is not a good quality. I even returned the other one unopened.
5,Grip like CRAZY .!!,"Best nails I have found to hold OSB on wall panels. No need too use 2 3/8 "" nails when 2"" does the trick, and cheaper too.."
4,Before its time,"I loved this book when I first read it many years ago, inspired by a positive review in the Toronto Star. What if we as a civilization decided that instead of spending tens of thousands of dollars on caring for people once they got old, we decided on a specific age that people would no longer be allowed to live? What if a group of young people decided on what that age would be? What would happen once the young people who made that decision started to reach ""the fixed period""?"
3,interesting idea but too long for the idea,"Interesting idea, and some humorous moments, but overall this book has far too many words for its story."
5,This book is excellent for first year medical students.,My good friend gave me this book in P.A. school and it has helped me so much with basic things like anatomy. Recommended. A+
3,Great for preclinical years,"This book would have been great in the first 3 years or so but has really limited use for the final (clinically orientated) years due to its focus on early material (anatomy, biochem etc). I'd love to see a clinical version of the same...."
4,"good book, late delivery",perfect copy of the book. i'd first ordered on kindle and the type was too inconsistent to read. the paperback arrived to late for the read aloud book group. still i am pleased to have this copy.
4,"New and Selected Poems, Vol. 1, by Mary Oliver","This book arrived on time and in new condition--an excellent buy for a small price. I like the poems very much. Occasionally, a poem strikes me as a bit too self-conscious. But Oliver's metaphors are imaginative, and I think that all in all she is the best poetic interpreter of the positive aspects of nature that we have here in America."
3,It's a youth helmet!,I needed an adult helmet and I looked over the information before buying this helmet and couldn't find anything indicating it was a youth helmet. Sure enough when it came it was a youth helmet. Darn.
3,"Good Boxing book, but lacking...","This book is a good, but not great or perfect Boxing book. It gives some decent (although mostly known) stories about the Boxing Heavyweight Lineal Champions until the 70s, but nothing that you should probably be going out of your way for. If you have cash hanging around, worth to pick up a copy, but otherwise, not really."
1,Love them at $7.99 - won't buy them here for $3 more!,"I am in my 5th year of diaper-buying & have found these truly to be the best diapers. HOWEVER, there is no reason for me to buy them at Amazon when I can use coupons at Rite Aid (which has basically the same retail) and pay much less."
2,Tricky pricing make it easier to go to the store...,"Three months ago when I began ordering diapers online, Amazon charged only $7.49 for a package. That same package is now $10.49. I can pick up diapers in the grocery store for $9.99--there is no longer enough of an incentive, even with free shipping (which takes f-o-r-e-v-e-r!) to order these diapers online. But as far as diapers go these are my favorite ones. They are absorbent and fit snugly on both of my children. I like them better than Huggies because each time I changed my son, there would be little beads from the diaper's liner clinging to his skin. I tried Huggies again with my daughter, but they just aren't as good a fit at the Pampers."
1,THREE DOLLAR INCREASE,I have been buying diapers on Amazon for several months and all of a sudden in the last couple weeks they increased the price by THREE DOLLARS! No longer is this the best solution to buy diapers. Go to Target -- They are cheaper there and take the pampers $1 off coupon that is in the paper almost weekly. BOOO on AMAZON for a ridiculous price increase. The grocery store even has a better price than this! The diapers are the best ones out there.
4,An inspiration to buck the trend,"After recently realising that a small, traditional boat can have many advantages over today's 'dream boat', it was a delight to discover others that share the experience. As I learn about the capabilities of my 18' gaff yawl, this book provides inspiration for fit-out, handling, rigging and, above all, the immense capabilities of a variety of well-designed small craft. By following the example of these writers, you'll be sailing sooner, more often and have more fun."
5,It's not the size that counts,"Wonderful book, about mostly ""trailer sailing"" boats, pack full of great information about the negatives and positives of the different small boats.I used this book to find the boat I wanted and would work for me."
5,Honestly the very best over-the-counter manual toothbrush!,"If you are like me, and do not have the greatest teeth, then this product is for you! It is easy on mygums. My teeth are cleaned thoroughly without having to scrub. Just use the toothbrush gently. Since I have been using this brand, I have not had any problems at the dentist in over 15 years. Thanks to Amazon, I discovered that this toothbrush even existed. My own dentist had been giving me a different brand, so I told him about this brand."
1,"Too ""sugary sweet"" for me.","I purchased this book for my 12 year old son and I to read, and we laughed so hard, we both were in tears. I'm a diabetic, and felt it necessary to check my blood sugar after reading how-it was SO sickeningly sweet! It seems to be lost in a time warp, far more apropos to the 1950's, rather than 2012, when I purchased it. We are Christians, and that was one of the book's selling points. Now that I have read it, I couldn't give it away-that's how bad it is. As an RN, I've dealt with very intimate issues with strangers; I wouldn't subject any of them to this drivel.I HIGHLY recommend ""The Boy's Body Book."" I'm sure there must be similar material for girls."
2,Don't know how I missed...,I don't know how I missed that this was a religious book. So not appropriate for my family. Glad I didn't have to pay for it.
1,Not What I expected,I purchase this Ryofu Housen figure and had to return it back the same day that it arrived for a full refund. The cause: Ryofu's head was missing large amounts of pain. Ryofu's hair directly above the left eye to be exact. The defect was obvious that it would take any one a second to realized the imperfection. Also the original packing that enclosed Ryofu was also damaged. The only thing that arrived in mint condition was the USPS box that was used to ship Ryofu. Very sad.
3,Bad timing,"Originally released in 1981, in the U.S. by Passport/Jem Records. Rick Wakeman, at the time, also released an album called '1984', based on the George Orwell book. Neither made much waves. As far as the content on this one, it's OK, but doesn't adapt to the story very well."
1,I still haven't finished it.,"I am a huge fan of romance novels, especially if they are set in Scotland, but this is one book I think I will never finish. The very first chapter turned me off of this author forever. If I ever do get bored enough to pick it up again, it will be for a laugh. I'm sorry, but there is a particular sentence towards the front of the book that is so stupid, I was embarrassed for the author. I bought the book because my two favorite authors didn't have any new books out so I decided to try something new. I wish I had saved my money. I don't usually give bad reviews, but....I had to do this."
3,3.5 Stars - Pretty Good,"While I would agree with other reviewers that this is not Virginia Henley's best work, it is still a nice read. The plot is a little loose, but it moves along nicely, and the secondary characters in particular are well drawn. Heath and Raven seem a bit too willing to give each other up, but I chalk this up to dramatic necessity, thought I wish that the author had used something more believable and more consistent with her characters' temperaments.One thing Henley excels at is her excellent descriptive ability when it comes to time and place, and for that reason alone, I would recommend this book."
4,Surprisingly lively,I liked this story a great deal and plan to keep the hardcover copy I bought as part of my collection. It wasn't overly dramatic but at the same time it made you sit up and think. I enjoyed how the heroine became part of what she had been brought into and the way she overcame things. Henley is very clever at weaving a story and I hope to read more of her books in the future. My hat off to you !
3,Disappointed,"Actually, I would give this book 2 1/2 stars if I could because it was only half as good as it should have been. I am surprised that the same author who wrote ""Enslaved"" which was one of the best books I've ever read could have possible written this piece of fluff. This is a great author or I never would have spent the money on the hardcover, but when I do buy the hardcover, I expect the book to be above the average. This one was not. There was no substance. The book never really took hold and got going. Even the antagonism between the hero and heroine was limp. I never got the point. Try harder next time Virginia. I am a great fan of your and have read ALL of your books, but you let me down this time."
3,Not Worth The Wait,I am usually a big fan of Virginia Henley's work. I'm afraid that this book did not live up to her previous work. The main characters were interesting - but the plot was very thin. I kept waiting for more to happen. Some of the plot lines were just dropped with no explanation. I will admit that I finished the book 3 days after it arrived - but it just didn't match the last two - A Woman of Passion and The Marriage Prize.
2,Wrong wrong wrong,"The language used in this book was just so wrong for the time period, as well as some of the plot twists (why is it okay for a proper English lady in the 1500s to travel by herself through the forest in the dark while her brother travels on?), it was extremely distracting. I thought I was going to go crazy if I heard about Raven exploring her ""sexual"" self again. Raven was a total twit, Heath was definitely hot, and I have no clue what attracted him to her. Oh, and the ending? Completely unbelievable. Two stars for Heath, and that's about it."
4,Very Good!,What are you guys crazy? How could you leave such bad reviews? This is a very good book. I read it about a month or two ago and I still have a clear picture in my head.
1,A great disappointment,"I have tried to read Ms. Henleys' work before and it isn't my cup of tea, as they say. Border Hostage was the last I will try. I found the sex scenes lewd and too graphic and the characters shallow. As an owner of two mares I particularly didn't like the lead in pages to the story. Perhaps people don't mind reading a detailed account of the mating between a stallion and mare which at first gives you the impression that it is two people and not horses, but I didn't like how it came across. I wouldn't recommend this book and it's the last of Ms. Henleys' I will buy."
1,Not good,"I did not care for these characters. The dialogue was so blah that they didn't feel real at all. The secondary characters were more alive than the hero and heroine. In fact, I think that the secondary characters took up more of the plot than Heath and Raven. It was almost as though Virginia Henley was plotting out her next sequel and couldn't decide on which characters she should write about. Too many to keep track of. Through more than 1/2 of the book Raven and Heath weren't even together. Even when you thought they were it might have all been a dream. When they were actually together it was so wooden and boring that there was absolutely no chemistry. I'm sure they deserved each other though. At least they believed that there was a connection. All the magic and earth healing got to be sooooo old. Yuck."
3,Disappointing,"There are other Virginia Henley titles that are much better than this one. The plot was very loose, and the main female character, Raven, was extremely unlikeable. She really seemed like a twit - she frittered around never doing anything that you'd expect her to do after she learned something more about her supposed-to-be fiance (Dacre) or Heathe. Even in the end, when she accompanies Margaret across the border Raven seems confused and unclear about what she's doing. Raven is a space cadet who ends up with Heathe in the end - who knows how."
3,"Although entertaining, very weak plot","I am a huge fan of Virginia Henley and have read all of herbooks. I was disappointed in this latest novel; it seems the plot was somewhat thin and quickly devised. I enjoy her characters and historical accuracy, but this was not one of herbest works. I still think she is the best romantic fiction writer and will continue to look forward to her next release."
1,Didn't like,I could not get through this book. The dialogue was horrible!!! I read at least one book a week and this was the worst book I've come across in a while.
3,Not sure of results,I got this for my husband who broke his back. We are still listening to it every night as he goes to sleep. Cannot say if it has helped any...
3,Somewhat disappointed,"This book came with high recommendations and expectations but for me the book failed to live up to them. The characters are inventive and memorable but their treatment falls short and the stories repeatedly end on a dissatisfying note. I agree with the Amazon review that her characters' promise and development seems to stall out of some kind of self conscious regard for academic critique and conflict, etc. (I'm not an academic, but you can feel their eyes on the text.) I wish she'd just let it rip. I also think the writing suffers from a lack of a clear voice; the voice often seem contrived and forced and in some instances just competely derails the story. The good part is the characters themselves, who are memorable despite their author's too-often shallow treatment."
4,This toothbrush has a wider handle and fits ...,"This toothbrush has a wider handle and fits my hands better by giving me a better grip. The bristles are wider (the front bristles being longer), and therefore, it allows me to clean behind my teeth better and to reach and clean my teeth better at the very back. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this toothbrush to my family and friends."
4,Ooh.. shiney sword.,"It was fair in craftsmanship. The blad was slightly crooked, but that was the only thing I could find wrong with it. The carving in the sheath was beautiful, and my boyfriend loved his gift."
4,"Decent sword, fair warning:","Ok, the sword's appearance is pretty nice, it didn't dissapoint in that area.I suppose I'm not a blind swordsman, so I can't really complain, but it's about as sharp as a butter knife, possibly a little more dull.The sword fits in the scabbard well enough, but when sheathing it gets stuck at the end, and you have to force it just the right way, and it's not as clean as I'd like it to be.All petty nitpicking aside, it's a nice show piece, maybe with a little sharpening I could become a blind samurai!"
3,Should've taken the gold and run,"The first half of this novel was good. After their plane crashes on a deserted Pacific island, the strong, silent hero and the feisty, independent heroine clash initially and then succumb to the romantic setting and fall in love. Unfortunately, she doesn't tell him she's in love, and he tells her but she's not buying it. The second half of the novel is filled with subplots (stolen gold, pregnancy, a bitter divorce, etc) that are more distracting and annoying than interesting. And everything falls into place a little too neatly at the end. This was my first Heather Graham novel; I'm not sure if I'll try another."
5,Stranded,I wish that men in real life could compare to Heather Graham's men. I have never met one. I would love to be stranded on an island with someone like Kyle. The book was great. Heather Graham's books are always good and very hard to put down.
5,Outstanding book,"This book contains outstanding descriptions and illustrations. Because of the price of the latest edition, I bought the previous edition for the class. There was sufficiently little difference between the two consecutive editions that I was able to easily keep up in class and made a high 'A'."
1,stolen credit card info,The product arrived on time and in perfect condition. I was thrilled that is until I got a phone call from my bank putting a hold on my account for suspicious charges. This was my first time to use my debit card online with an international company and all of a sudden I was having international charges. They charged a hotel rooom at trumph towers and 2 hotel rooms in Aruba. Maybe this was just a coincidence but I doubt it. Be extremely careful when buying books online for so cheap. I was so excited when I found out I could buy this $200 book onlline for $0.01 but maybe they only wanted a penny because they were just gonna make other charges without my consent!!!!! I will not do business with this company ever again!
1,microbiology workbook braum,"HAVE NEVER RECIEVED THIS BOOK AFTER 4 WEEKS, HAVE CONTACTED SELLAR AND AFTER ALMOST 2 WEEKS NO ANSWERS AND NO TRACKING FROM USPS?????? WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR SCHOOL AS YOU NEVER RECEIVED SHEILA SMITH"
4,Need more time,Seems like it will be useful in research but I will need more time to evaluate completely. Happy that I could get a copy here.
3,Significant work.,"This is a significant work highlighting the development of 'local theology'. My impatience with it is that it is written deductively, with theorems presented. Why is it, I wonder, that an essentially inductive approach to theology must be turned into a deductive experience for the reader? A useful book for graduate students and libraries; undergraduates and M.Div.s could give it a pass."
4,Nice read,"I enjoyed the book. Facts and time sequences hung together through the whole story, the characters were believable, results of the time travel experience were reasonable, and the flow of the story and the character's interactions moved logically.There were no 'Oh come on!' moments, suspension of belief was minimal and slight (once past the initial time travel premise - acceptable), with just enough plot twists to keep the story moving. I enjoyed the book."
1,Good plot.....but.,"The plot for this story line was cute once you figure it out in the end but it's a long boring read to get there. This story needed much work and editing long before being published. How did it happen? If the author actually got money for this, I'm going to try my hand at it, it couldn't be worse!"
5,Spirit of Place,"If you are interested in the environment which generated the powerful West Coast Native art, the artist, Emily Carr, conjures it up in this original book. Her travels to their coastal villages are translated into these atmospheric essays."
3,"Good, but not her best","While I think the stories in this book are important, they do not represent Carr's best. Many are repetitive. The value of the book lies in the portraits she paints of the changes to the tribes in and around British Columbia. I would recommend this to those interested in indigenous populations. I feel her other writings are better to learn about her art and way of thinking."
2,autism cd,"This is a wonderful gesture by a mom of a son with autism and most of the lyrics are beautiful. However, it does not sound like a professional CD and her voice is very hard to listen to. I was somewhat disappointed as it is not a very professional nor good quality CD."
1,Don't bother buying this CD you will return it!,This is the worst music I have ever heard!This lady not only can not sing but the wordsto the songs are just plain bizzare!
4,Balanced Skating,"This video is really balanced between technical and go big. There wasn't much from the Toy Team, but there were alot of others. The editing is awesome, it just goes with the music. I would give it 5 stars but there is alot of weird stuff in between the skating, even though that can be cool."
1,Salty Shiit,"After watching this lame, boring skateboard video, I decided to go home and wack-off to elf porn."
3,this video is tight.,"its nice, but not as good as the new philadelphiaexperiment video. lots of philly stars to watch skate like kalis and the toymachine crew. see it now@!"
4,Good introduction to Buddhist meditation,"This book should meet a variety of needs. It covers classical meditation, touches on Zen meditation and has selections from the ""Vimuttimagga"". There are commentaries on meditation manuals. The book also offers interpretations of the nature of Zen training and the practice of mindful awareness by two young priest, accomplished in the Buddhist traditions of Southeast and East Asia."
4,Instant AutoCAD: Architectural Desktop 2.0,"Excellent introduction to Architectural Desktop. Contains all the info needed to start creating buildings. Does not have the all the details necessary to fully use all the tools in the program, but hits the high points. It is important that the reader have a basic understanding of AutoCAD before using this book--the book does not teach AutoCAD basics--only covers Arch DT specifics. Good exercises written into the book to help with the learning process."
5,excellent product,"Received this product and it was very easy to hookup. The directions are skimpy, but I did not need them to use the product. It took about five minutes to have it up and running. I have hooked to it blu-ray player, hd dvd player, direct tv, and onkyo receiver. Some said it did not come with the hdmi cable but there was one in the package. The only thing I wished it had was an off and on control on the remote, but I just plan on leaving it on. The red lights are a little bright. To fix that I took the box it came in and made a front cover cutting a notch for the ir. Since the box is black and unit is black, in the stereo cabinet you can not tell that it is covered. Just and added note I also used the box to put a small cover for the direct dvr blue circle which is also a little bright. The direct dvr is also black. The remote works flawlessly. I am very pleased with the unit."
2,Not all connects,I was very excited about receiving this item. Unfortunately it did not work with my computer to tv. I would constantly have to play with the different switch locations before I could get a picture and even then it would not have sound so I would switch again. However with my other connections it worked fine. And yes when I hooked my hdmi directly from computer to tv it worked fine. So not all connects.Devaine
1,Not a quality product,"This product does not work with my HD cable box nor with my HD-DVD player. It does work with my Xbox 360, but 1 out of 3 isn't enough."
4,"Great product, but you will need welding goggles.. read on..","The product is great! I use it to manage my Cable box and Xbox 360. The box is completely intuitive and switch by itself to the appropriate devise. I don't even think I've used the remote once. The price is great and the quality is also very good. No problems for my 3 months of ownership.I'm not sure why people are knocking the documents?? Its a switch, there isn't a lot of confusion to which port to use is there or where to put the power. I didn't even look at it.Cons: The indicator lights on the front of the box and nearly blinding. I'm not sure why they made them some bright, but I have to put something in front of them so I can watch TV."
1,Doesn't work with laptop,"I purchased this to share 1 HDMI input on the TV with a PS3 and Toshiba laptop with HDMI output.The PS3 works great through the device, but the laptop doesn't recognize that an HDMI device is plugged in, so it does not work for me. I understand that this is a common issue with all similar devices. I don't know if the fault actually lies with the switch or the laptop, but either way, it doesn't work for me."
4,Good product,"Everything works fine, i just wish that i can turn on/off from the remote control. Very annoying when the rest is wireless."
1,5 port HDMI switch,"This was a real disappiontment. Three ports were not working. I sent the item back and asked for a credit only, not another switch."
2,"HEAVY, SOLID, AND FULL OF GLITCHES","I had to run the PS3 through the 5th port but all components(DVD, Dish SAT,and PS3) during use will indiscriminately go on the blink.The only way to get a picture back is to either power the TV off then on.Or you switch to another port."
4,A good product with a few limitations,"Like other reviewers, I found this to be good switch, but I've found a few limitations. I discovered that when I attached my Sony Blu-ray player to my Sony Bravia KDL-V40 monitor through this switch, I could only get a picture on inputs 4 or 5 (the screen remained blank on inputs 1, 2 or 3, but the Blu-ray player did indicate that it had an HDMI link). I had no problems getting a picture when attaching my Toshiba HD-A2 HD-DVD player on any input. I then moved both players and the switch to my Panasonic PT-AE900U projector. I had no problems getting a picture on all five inputs with either player. I don't have a Sony Playstation, so I can't do any tests with one, but it may be somewhat finicky like my Blu-ray player.In summary, some combinations of players and monitors may not work on all inputs through this switch. In my case, this isn't a problem, I only had two devices to hook up. Others may not find that limitation acceptable."
4,NOTE - ONLY PORT #5 will work with Apple TV,thanks to the other reviews for turning me on to this possibility. I was frustrated out of my mind before figuring that out. Now I am VERY HAPPY with this switcher - great for the price!!
3,"Unfortunately, the product did not work with my setup","Although, I am sure this is a good product, it did not work with my Plasma TV (Panasonic TH-50PX75U). I suspect that is because the Panny is a new product. I shipped the product back to the seller, and am expecting a refund, which, because I am dealing with Amazon, will be shortly forthcoming."
1,Bad experience.,Seller did not deliver the product as it showed in Amazon. It was totally different with no name on it. I contacted seller and eventually they refunded my money. Of course I have to lose $8.52 on return the product.
1,Bad Experience,"Hi,Maybe my luck with this product, I bought this in Feb 2009 and now its not working, I would not recommend this to anybody"
5,The Book of Daniel,The Best explanation and Exposition of the Book of Daniel I have read. At last I feel I am beginning to understand Daniel's Book.
5,Great book,"I think this was a very easy read. Parents who have children with special needs or who are challenging should benefit from reading this book. I think if parents want more specific information about particular diagnoses they would need to look to another source. This would be a good book to start with. I feel there was good, positive advice given.Isabelle ZehnderFounder and PresidentCoalition Against Institutionalized Child Abuse (CAICA)www.caica.org"
3,good but kind of slow; for faster stuff check out chumps...,"I came from school one day and was happy to find my order from asain man records had come. among the things i had ordered was mu330's cd press. so i popped it into my trusty cd player and started listening. i was dissapointed to find that most of the songs were pretty slow. having heard MU330's newer cd ""chumps on parade"" i thought press would be just as fast. sadly it isn't. of press' 12 songs (10 if you got the old one) the best songs are ""hoosier love"", ""stuff"", and ""kong"". kong is a new song on the cd, if you get the old press then you will not get ""kong"" or ""fist fulla nuts""."
4,NOT THE BEST BUT GOOD,"A YEAR A GO I STUMBLED ON MU330'S THIRD RELEASE ON ASIAN MAN RECORDS CRAB RANGOON AND FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS AND NINE MONTHS LATER I ORDERED PRESS AND CHUMPS ON PARADE FROM MIKE PARK AND FRIENDS UP IN MONTE SERENO,CA. WHEN I RECIEVED THESE TWO CD'S I LOVED THEM BUT CRAB RANGOON IS STILL THE BEST."
5,FANTASTIC!!,"I took all 3 of my children (8 through almost 13) to see this movie - it was wonderful! Save the few bad words, which my children giggled at, it was very moving, made me cry, made me laugh, and made me hope! I have taught school in the area where Akeelah lived, and the hopelessness at her school is not unreal. It's very prevalant, and for her to make something of herself was very inspiring. All 3 of my children enjoyed the movie, also."
5,Akeelah and the Bee,This movie should have received an Oscar. The acting is superb. The LA setting is convincing. The message is for every kid that ever tried hard. A must see for middle & high schoolers everywhere.
5,Love this movie,I watched this movie when if first came out on DVD and I loved it. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. The acting is superb and the story is memorable and amusing.
5,Just Fantastic!,"This is one of the best movies of the year. Have tissue ready, this one will make you cry."
5,Akeelah & the Bee,"Excellent DVD, would highly recommend. Loved Keke Palmer and I can't believe she was only 11 when she did the movie. Wonderful heartfelt family movie."
3,Language,"This is a great movie, a great story, and very motivational. And Keke Palmer is adorable -- adorable! -- in this film.I would caution young families about this movie: there is language in the beginning 1/2 hour that may not be right for your family. We heard ""tear your black a** up"" and ""where the h*ll have you been? (from the mother to the daughter)"" and at least 3 other not-family-friendly phrases.Once the spelling begins, the bad language stops. And I really like the movie and think it's great. But I'm surprised the language didn't merit a PG-13 rating."
2,Not for Small Children,"Usually when a movie is rated PG, I preview it before I let my 7 and 9 year old daughters watch it, but unfortunately, I didn't do that with this one. If I had previewed it, I wouldn't have allowed my children to watch it. Yes, the rating says there is ""adult language"" in the movie, but with PG, that usually means just one or two words. That isn't what it meant with this one. There was foul language throughout the movie and not just from adults. Even the kids were cursing throughout the movie. Personally, if I was going to make a movie for families, I wouldn't have had so much foul language in it. It was not necessary for the advancement of the plot.On a positive note, this was a good story with a great (though predictable) ending, but if you don't like your kids' minds and ears being filled with ALOT of senseless cursing, don't let them see it or at least preview it first."
3,Conscientious,"The last time I had to spell for my life, 'conscientious' was the word that I missed. Never will I forget it. It's mostly because of my own sentiments for Spelling Bees that I won't forget this film. It was well done, although formulaic in character development and plot. The writing, likewise, was nothing stellar, but I would imagine that if I was 11 years old I would think it was fantastic. Keke Palmer was wonderful, and I hope to see her again out in the world."
4,Akeelah does the bee,I like this movie. I really like it when they have the big spelling bee. And I like it when her white friend stalled for her when she had to go talk to her not very happy Mom. Good movie
5,Delightful and Inspiring,"Akeelah doesn't think being smart is very cool. She's bored with most of her school work, has problems at home, and just wants to fit in with other kids. But when she sees a girl on television win a championship spelling bee, Akeelah can't think of anything else. Meanwhile, her single mother has struggles of her own trying to feed her family and hold things together while also mourning the loss of her murdered husband. Akeelah wonders if all the hard work is worth it, but soon finds that there are many people in her family and community who believe in her, giving her the courage to stand up and 'shine'. A coming-of-age story you won't want to miss.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
5,Akeelah and the Bee,"quick delivery, good movie, nothing broken, ripped, or scratched, perfect condition, will buy from again."
4,akeelah and the bee,"My grandaughters loved this movie. They identified with Akeelah's struggle to confront her ""willingness to shine""- very common with teens. I recommend young teens and parents to see this movie along with a cup of cocoa and a chat afterwards."
4,A very enjoyable story,"Great script, great actors and a warm ""feel good"" story. Enjoyed it very much and have encouraged all my friends to view it as well. Very enjoyable.I am sure I will watch it frequently over the coming years. A very good buy.Gary"
4,Very Uplifting.,"This is not the type of film I would typically see, let alone enjoy. It is a bit formulaic and predictable. But I must admit to being enchanted by the wonderfully uplifting story about a young African American girl who realizes her dream of winning the National Spelling Bee. One reason I enjoyed it so much is that it presented a hopeful view of an inner city charcter who, despite the odds, accomplishes a seemingly impossible goal. I also liked the fact that Akeelah is a three-dimensional character as are the many people of her South Central neighborhood who cheer her on. The film resonates with a deep humanity that reveals the common need to dream that we all share, regardless of our race or socio-economic status. See this film if you're ever in need of feeling good on a bad day."
4,Worth the Money,I re-watched this movie a few weeks ago and forgot how entertaining and educational it was. It's not Oscar material but it's fun. Good story line and if you're not careful you just my learn something. Can you use the word in sentence? Can you give me the definition? Can you give me the word origin? Can you use it in a song? Funny stuff.
3,Bee Minus,"As a spelling bee participant and sometime champion as both a child and an adult, I wanted to like this fictionalized account of an inner-city girl's quest for the National Spelling Bee championship more than I did. The young actress who played Akeelah was wonderful, but the story was too manipulative in an effort to create extra drama. Comparison to the wonderful documentary ""Spellbound"" was also too big a challenge."
1,Too much cusing for a family movie.,I would have enjoyed this movie much more if I hadn't had to remind my children that the curse words used in this movie were not appropriate. I was shocked at the frequency of the four letter words used in this PG movie. Who cares that the story line was to be inspiring??? I was too busy explaining to my boys that we do not approve of the language used in this movie.I do not care that this movie was set to depict a rough family life...that could have been done without the language. I thought this was a family movie. We had to stop the movie half way into it to explain to our 8 year old boys why this movie is not acceptable. We chose to watch the rest of the movie without the kids to decide if we were going to allow them to see the rest.Bottom line.....this is not an appropriate movie for 8 year olds. I am so disappointed in this movie for this reason.
3,A Bit Overdone,"Typical Hollywood ""feel-good"" film using by-the-book feel-good film formula. Even still, I'd like to think there is a sap inside each and everyone of us who yearns for this type of emotional candy.The actress who plays Akeelah plays her part well, but I couldn't help sort of rooting against her by the end because I felt like I was being tricked by the filmakers, lured into shedding tears over this near perfect girl. The Indian kid who she was up against seemed more real, I kinda wanted him to burst her bubble.Anyways, this is well done for an all-out Hollywood tear jerker meant to make you root for Akeelah all the way. If you're okay with over-dramatized fluff, then this'll have you in Kleenex heaven."
5,From another time.,"Basically, if you ever liked New Order, the Pet Shop Boys, the first Electronic album or any of their followers you'll love this single. Tennant assumes lead vocals for the whole song (he had previously halfed them with Bernard on 'The Patience of a Saint'). Excellent melodies and minimal harmonies make this an excellent song, the remixes aren't bad either, especially the 808-state remix. A memorable ode to all things Manchester (and Factory) in the 1980's, its hard to believe this came out in the age of Nirvana and Suede, but its still excellent. Highly recommended."
3,Booooorrrrrriiiiinnnnnggggggg,"I read a lot of history books, I like ones that even most people would find dull, but this is the abosolute worst. It gives an eccelent account of US history in the time period of the Articles of Confederation, and could be used as a refference, but DO NOT attempt to sit down and read this cover to cover as I did. Jensens writing style is unbearable."
3,Less than Jake RULES,Less than jake brings a hip new sound of ska to the table. The really rule! Johny Quest thinks were sell outs is one of my favorite songs ever. Even if you don't buy the CD you need to download the song it kicks like a monkey.
4,Great release from the best ska band,"This album has a bunch of awesome songs and a handful of mediocre as well... it has ska anthems and if you don't own this album you are not a true LTJ fan. This is mandatory its not optional. Liquor Store, My Very Own Flag, Johnny Quest, Shotgun, Throw The Brick, Jen, and 3 Quartz Drunk are classics but there is not a single bad song on the album (actually I don't think I've ever heard a BAD LTJ song) Like another reviewer said this album is not as polished as later works and that is why i DONT like it as much... buy Losing Streak first but any LTJ album is going to be worth the money."
3,eh,"ehh itspretty good but, i couldnt find very many good melodys. if u want some good really catchy tunes get Hello rockview and or greased and or losing streak etc etc etc"
1,Buy pez core first,I have been a fan of ltj for 6 years and I love this cd. I still listen to it on a regular basis. It is dirtier than their newer albums. If you are a fan of their newer stuff you may not like this album. This was the first ltj album i bought and i believe it is thier best.
3,"it's pretty good, but....","you know that song ""johnny quest thinks were selouts"" i think its extremly funny that they are making fun of people who think they are sellouts (that was in 1995) but 11 (8 when anthem came out) years later, they really are a sellout band. nice going LTJ. this is an okay album, but Losers, rockview, and Boundaries are way better. (Borders and boundaries is where they started to sell out, but they were still good)"
2,1st full length LTJ release isn't quite as good as i hoped,"Less Than Jake's Asian Man records release, ""Pezcore"", is an ok CD. It lacks a different variety of styles, and all songs basically sound the same. However, ""Liquor Store"", ""One Last Cigarette"", and ""Where The Hell is Mike Sinkovich"" are all great songs, and deserve to be recognized."
5,Great,Love this movie! It was very easy to purchase and use. I did it all at school for my classroom.
5,Good Family Movie,"Holes, based on the best-selling and award-winning children's book by Louis Sachar, is a clean, wholesome adventure that is sure to please every movie-lover in your family.Fans of the book will appreciate the effort made to keep the movie true to the book. They did a great job with this, perhaps because the author is also the screenwriter.The story is easy to follow even for the youngest in your family (my four year old daughter loved it). The story is simple, yet exciting and captivating enough for the older crowd.I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking to add a good family picture to your movie collection."
5,when i saw this movie..i was diggin it!! I LOVE KHLEO(ZERO),"this is the best movie of the year..by far!!!this film is for all ages no matter what! this movie is soo excellent i saw it 6 times in the theater and i am planning on buying it 2 times when it comes out on SEPTEMBER 23!!! i cant wait 88 more days!! i thought that everyone did a wonderful job on acting and filming. i thought that ZERO(KHLEO THOMAS) was the best actor in the movie! he is sooo inoccent in the movie...and he is sooo SEXY! i love him to death....this movie is a very injoyable film and has a lot of emmotions in it...like some parts of the movie you cry and some parts you laugh and smile. i cried when zero finally saw his mom again..after seraching for her with private investagators. its soo cute and sad when hes hugging her and says""i love you!!"" i wish he could say that to me! i gave this movie 5 stars..if you havent seen this movie..you better go to the theater now...or wait till it comes out on video and dvd!..."
3,Disney does karma,"lighthearted, funny, absorbing movie about the twisting fate of two kids. it is as if Disney wanted to teach the doctrine of karma for dummies. you know the idea that ""what goes around, comes around"". flashbacks back about 100 years relate the unbelievable, maze-like tales of two families, one is the stanley yelnats 1-4 and the other a fortune teller who curses the family.the story is involved enough to let us guess the routes karma will take while laughing at the improbability of the whole thing. so its a kid's movie with a point, not badly done, you cheer with the audience at all the right times and hiss the villain.so all is well with the world, Disney teaches karma for dummies and we all cheer the winners. cool."
3,Doesnt follow the book but oh well.,"Holes wasnt too bad. Although it doesnt follow the book.In the movie Stanley was skinny. In the book it says he is FAT! oh well. It left you wondering, but still an O.K. movie 3 stars."
3,Ok movie,"The movie was ok, it wasn't wow or anything, but it is a good movie to watch when you're bored. I thought the book was much better though."
5,"Oh, Wow. Amazing.","This movie is the best movie ever!!! It has suspense, action, drama, and comedy. The cast of actors was great. I highly recommend this to anybody. To make a long story short, it's about a boy (Shia LaBeouf) who gets sent to a juvenile detention center to dig holes. They dig because the Warden (Siqourney Weaver) is looking for the treasure of a long-dead outlaw. I give this movie two thumbs up as the best movie ever."
5,LOVED IT,The movie was great. Played all the way through with no problems. Packaging was good and received fast.
5,This movie is the best eva!?!??!,"Holes is the best movie eva, and i would know since i saw it 5 times!! I especially like the portrayal that Khleo Thomas did as Zero... Every actor did there part to bring this epic film to life... every scene leaves u wanting more, as it bounces through different time periods helping to piece together the real truth and some untold explanations..."
3,Holes: the movie,"Almost 50% of all kids nowadays read the book ""Holes"" in school. Finally, this movie is out. It follows precisely the original story, so it can be interesting to compare the two.The story is about a young boy, Stanley Yelnats (what's peculiar about that name), who gets sent to boot camp. He gets put there because he is accused of a crime he didn't commit. He is then forced to dig a hole 5 feet wide and 5 feet deep for every day for a year. Soon, you realise that the digging is for a treasure, not for no reason.The movie is well done, but very slow paced. All the colors all also the same dirt color, which takes a bit out of the movie in the long run. If you've read the book, then I suggest this movie, otherwise, read the book first."
5,Summer Camp Fun,"Ever been to summer camp? Stop wondering. This film will tell you all you ever wanted to know and alot you didn't. The sun, the sand, the wildlife and the warden?Stanley Yelnats gets railroaded into a summer camp program and meets his destiny. This is great fun for all the family."
4,Very Entertaining,Watched it with our Granddaughter. Good clean entertainment with a worthwhile storyline. A little silly but Good wins over evil.
5,great movie,This movie is great...we watched it in my classroom and then came home and watched it with my kids....they loved it
5,Holes,This movie was perfect and received in time for my 4th grade grandson to share with his class. They had just finished reading the book.
1,Sucked,"Weak characters. Retarded plot. Who are the people giving this 5 stars?? Have you ever seen a good movie? FYI, this is not one of them."
4,Pretty Good!,"""Holes"" is not just your run-of-the-mill film adapted from a kids' book. It is a fascinating story filled with twists that keep the audience wondering what they will find out next. For those who love the book, they can appreciate that the screenplay was also written by the author. Newcomer Shia LaBeouf has much potential (if only he can stay away from movies like ""Dumb and Dumberer""), and I hope to see him develop his talents. Not-so-good performances by Sigourney Weaver and Jon Voigt, however. Regardless, it's great movie for the family, but also fun to just watch by yourself. Enjoy!"
1,bad product/damaged,the case from the cd was broken!! for me trying to do a gift to my sister it did not worked i had to buy another movie from a local retailer...the ompany that sold me the produt didnt do anything to solve my problem. they pretty much say u paid so u keep it... it makes it look like all they want is just say without caring about what the customer says..
4,Excellent film,I am a teacher and my students are reading the book during silent reading and we are watching the movie as a reward. It is a pretty faithful adaption of a very good book. I would recommend it.
5,Near Perfect Adaptation of Great Book,The movie version of HOLES is wonderful and very close to the popular and well written book for children/young adults. This is not surprising since Louis Sachar who wrote the novel also wrote the screenplay. The movie is well cast except Shea Labeuf does not look much like the Stanley described in the book as the novel's Stanley has a weight problem at the book's start while Labeuf is always about normal size. There are a couple of flashbacks in the book but they are handled without confusion to any viewer who is paying attention or is over age seven. And like in the book all the plot lines are tied up very neatly by the end.
5,HOLES IS THE BEST!,"This movie was so exciting and funny that if i could rate it more that 5 stars i would! I recomend anyone that hasn't seen it, that they should give it a try before they judge it."
4,Fun movie,"This is a great story done really well. The only reason I gave it four stars was because it was a bit confusing, with all its skipping to different side stories. My mom was confused when she was watching it. Other people have told me, though, that they didn't think it was confusing."
5,Could anyone not like this?,".THIS is the kind of family entertainment I wish I'd had as a child. It doesn't talk down to children with cardboard characters, and consequently neither children nor parents are bored by it. Every piece of the story fits well: there is no filler, and the screenplay has a constant forward momentum, thanks to the mystery of the various narrative lines which weave together. It's more complex than most children's movies, which may help explain its popularity. (A teacher I know tells me that some teachers use the book Holes as a carrot for the children to behave: we won't read from Holes today unless everyone behaves, and it works.)The actors are all really great, not just the adults (who really put a lot of effort into it: Jon Voight is hilarious as Mr. Sir), but also the kids in the camp. It's really really well done. Don't delay, buy it today!"
1,"Good book,Bad movie","What a mess,so much hype for one stupid movie based on Louis Sachar's better book.the movie is terrible it stars the most annoying kid actor Shia LeBeouf as Stanley Yelnats being accused of stealing shoes and sent to a camp where he and other juveniles dig holes for punishment.the owners of Camp Green Lake are so cruel.Jon Voight and Sigourney Weaver in their worst roles ever are really badly mis-cast.the plot is confusing and the kids at this camp are losers.one of the worst movies ever.it's down there with Batman and Robin,The Matrix 1 and 2,Isthar,Gigli,Amazon Women on the Moon,Baby Geniuses,Mary Shelley's Frankenstein{1994},Godzilla{1998},Crash{David Cronenberg's},Jason X,Adventures of Pluto Nash,Dreamcatcher,Daredevil,Scary Movie 1 and 2,and Not another teen movie.all the worst movies ever,so far."
1,A waste of money,Why anybody found this movie funny is beyond me. I would rather do homework(and I'm a grad student) than watch this piece of garbage. Anybody who doesn't fall asleep during this two hour debacle should be given an award.
5,Holes is a great family movie!,Our family likes to watch this movie every single year. It is a clean movie with lots of good humor.
5,THIS MOVIE RULEZ!!!!:),the book and movie are great. the movie had great flashbacks extremely true to the book. i read the book 9 times and saw the movie twice. READ THE BOOK CAN DIE HAPPY AND SEE THE MOVIE. THEN YOU CAN DIE HAPPY.
4,Cute but could be confusing...,If you are not familar with the book or if you found the book to be confusing you may find this movie a bit confusing. The plot is great and can be funny when not being serious and trying to get across a moral. This movie is worth watching and even buying.**It is a good family movie and something you can watch with them.**
4,excellent!!,"At first, I didn't see where this movie was going, but soon I loved it!! Kids will enjoy it. It's a true adventure story with flashbacks from the past about Kissing Kate..(something or other) and it truly unique!!"
4,Holes,"Holes is about a boy named Stanely who went to a criminal delinquent camp. He got sent to this camp because of his no good rottenpistealing great great grandfather. He had bad luck and he passed it on to his Stanley's grandpa,father, and himself. So one day he was coming from school and Bam!!! He got hit in the head by a shoe.The cops were looking for that shoe. So they acussed Stanley for stealing the shoes. So they sent him to a camp. At camp Green Lake, he was forced to dig holes."
5,HATER OF COMPS,"I usually despise compilations, but this one is very very good. All the artists are new to me, except for Nate Ruth, and all the artists are worthwhile in their respective genres. It's short and to the point, which I adore, and it's diverse enough to hold the attention throughout. Wish more comps were like this one."
5,Great!,"I stumbled across Arielle Dombasle on eMusic a while back while looking for a good version of ""Sway"". I liked her sound and the fact that she did both the English version and the Spanish original, ""Qien Sera"" in the same performance. I looked around and found some other favorite popular classics by her and I liked them all.The real question in my mind was why did I like her? At this time, I'd never seen her, only heard her. Objectively, I had to admit that her voice, while good, wasn't the greatest. Yet there was something about her that I really liked.The answer came when I saw her video of ""Rhum and Coca-Cola"" on YouTube. It was great, and the reason was clear. Here was a woman who was having fun! Her affection for the music, combined with an apparent natural playfulness, came through whether you could see her or not.I now have both of her recent CD's (this one and ""Amor Amor"") and, although I recognize she is an acquired taste, can recommend them highly"
5,Motivational!,"I am enjoying this read and so many wonderful ideas to ponder as I go through a few chapters at a time. I have read Mr. Bailes other book,""Hidden Power for Human Problems"" which remains one of my all time favorites. This book is very good as well and has given me more genuinely positive things to consider as I constantly try to improve the quality of my thinking and my life in general."
3,Leaks the same as other diapers,"Haven't noticed an improvement in leak protection versus other brands. They seem about the same really. What I did notice is that these diapers are not as soft on the legs as Pampers or Huggies Supreme (by far the softest, but also most expensive). If you don't normally have a lot of problems with leaks I'd say Luvs will work fine for you."
2,Horrible!,"If you like diapers that leak, then you will love Luvs! These diapers absorb wetness, but every time my daughter had a dirty diaper, she'd leak and I would have to change her clothes! I only let that happen a few times and then switched to Pampers instead, which is worth the money and time saved changing her clothes every morning!"
5,The Whole CD Is Anointed,Every song on this album is anointed and will find you in your spirit as you listen to them. So go ahead and purchase this album and be blessed in your spirit.
5,He Never Lost The Fight.,"I love the whole album,so uplifting and makes you feel good all over and keeps your mind on the heavenly father.it is dynamic I thank GOD for the Williams Sisters the whole album is a Blessing."
4,"Good, but Avallone has written better","I have read all of the Ed Noon mysteries and I think this one will be far down on the list. It's good, but not as good and the others. But, it is also cheap when you buy it for a Kindle."
2,most tests were not accurate,one of the flirting (body language) tests was good.Try Kokology...it can be more insightful.
1,Nice for entertainment...,I can only recommend this book to the ones who look for tones of tiny tests (like the ones provided in sunday magazines) for entertainment.
3,Book is simply fun,"Don't rely to heavily on the quizzes that are printed in the book. They are simply just for fun, but at times can be very accurate."
1,Not what I expected,The tests were very similar and easy to manipulate if you wanted to. Boring. I wasted my money.
3,Review what?,"I find it rather amusing that the auto system of Amazon is asking me to review this book in mid November, that was ordered in August and is yet to arrive. Does the reviewing robot not know what the delivery robot is doing?The three-star nuetral signifies potential, if I ever get it that might change!"
2,"Loud, louder and very loud, if you like it that way!","This record is performed in a very large space--and it sounds it. It is a trial to listen to all its contents in one sitting. There seems to be an obvious attempt (perhaps a self-conscious effort) to re-create the ""original"" sound of Biber's time. Although the content is interesting, I found it tiring listening probably due to the recording technique and in part to McCreech's approach---raw."
1,"good performance, dreadful recording","If you buy this recording, you'd better love the performance because the engineering is truly dreadful. It really is the most poorly engineered classical recording I've heard in the past 20 years. It completely lacks in clarity and intelligibility. It's as if they recorded with a single microphone, in a hallway, around the corner. The balance is poor between instruments and the organ. Perhaps if you were standing outside the church doors it might sound like this. Other than that, what's not to like?"
1,ANOTHER EXAMPLE,"Yes,here goes another example of eurotrash and lack of respect for the composer's and librettist's creation.The word pathetic cannot encompass the loathing that I feel for this production.A gigant like EMI should be ashamed to record such garbage! I bought the DVD on a hunch,looking for a new production of this extremely beautiful opera,knowing only the severalaudio recordings and the b/w film with Rudolf Schock and Isabele Straussconducted by Hans Zanotelli,which remains up to date the only video recording of the piece showing the time period and what the librettist wrote.As soon as I watched I returned to the record store and wanted my money back,not being though rewarded for the aggravation....A new video of this wonderful opera is still due.Hope a good stage director comes up with a good production shortly!"
4,Works great!,"Everything works great and it's simple to operate. The only surprise is that the alarm is not very loud and will not repeat if you do not stop it because you were in a noisy environment. The previous watch I owned with all these features (Timex) had a loud alarm. And it repeated if you did not respond and turn it off. The alarm at the end of the countdown timer is very short and will not repeat either. It should at least have an option to choose a louder alarm or repeat for those who expect to have noisier environments or have some hearing loss. The xBlack is a neat look with the dark (reversed) display, but it is somewhat harder to read unless there is a decent ambient light. The backlight is therefore quite necessary more often.Otherwise the functions work extremely well and its non-metal case is much lighter to wear than similar watches. If the alarm issues were met, I'd give it 5 stars."
4,A great watch...but the aluminium is perfect,"I've bought this one and works perfectly, but I've changed it for a X-Lander with Aluminium case, wich one is perfect."
1,Do yourself a favor..,"... and buy a GPS instead. I agree with previous reviewer (Dave57), I WOULD NEVER BUY A SUUNTO AGAIN. Worst than Dave, I simply got caught in heavy rain during a hike and my Vector was full of water, couldn't even tell the time. I send it to Suunto Finland for repair and they say that it leaked from the housing and ""kindly"" offered a repair for 140 Euros."
1,shocking,"I had a Suunto for 10 months. The face scratched VERY easily which was disappointing. However the worst thing is after swimming in a pool that I could stand up in the watch FILLED with water and died. On returning to Suunto they refused to fix it under warrantee because swimming is not covered ! They say the forces created by swimming are to much for this watch and it was never designed for this purpose, despite the sales literature saying it is water proof to 100m. I WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER SUUNTO PRODUCT. Whatsmore the shop I bought it from say they have lots returned for the same reason and non of them were fixed under warranty either. It is also very difficult to use and you cannot hear the alarm at all."
3,Get the old style ...,"I've had a VECTOR for more than 5 years, GREAT TOOL, but it finally slipped away to lost-watch land. I bought a new one and was very sad to send it back. You see, I could see the old black letters on a white face just fine, even in bright sunshine. The new improved model has faint green letters on a black background -- much harder to see while hiking or sailing, especially when wearing polarized sunglasses. The graphics on the new model are also much harder to discern --for example, the indicator for degrees F or degrees C is tiny (granted that is probably an issue only during set-up). The good folk at Suunto have still not addressed the problem of accidentally uncalibrating the barometric sensor -- that's a problem if you hit the buttons while running -- and the manual still doesn't help you get out of the mess in the field. It was a great product for backcountry activity, now it's mostly for show. Look for the old version and buy a new battery ..."
5,Great Watch,"In my opinion, for the price this is the best hiking watch around. I have been hiking and use all of the watch functions, as far as I can tell they are accurate, except the temperature when it is on my wrist, so I take it off for 15 to 20 minutes as it has been suggested and it is more in line with the temperatures in my area. I hike in 100 degree temps, and a bit higher."
5,AWESOME,"This watch has everything needed to do anything. I, being a skier, bought this watch to find my way back to base camp after a long day of skiing. The watch a) new the altitude of the base camp b) the compass guided me on a specifc heading without flaw <and> c) it held up to the harshest conditions that France had to offer. Anyone who needs direction in the wilderness, MUST have this watch."
1,"Suunto Vector, Complete Letdown!","Honestly, for me, the watch is a disappointment. I should have paid more for a better model from a different company.Cheap construction and a bad sensor for the temp. They should put a crystal in the face, or atleast some higher quality material. I have had it for a month and it is already a mess.I have always had my eye on a Suunto and when I finally bought one it turned out to be a waste of money!"
5,Definitely worth the money,"My husband loves his new watch! The price was much lower than retail, fast delivery, would buy from this seller again."
1,Too Complicated to Use,"I am pretty technical, but this watch is very very difficult to use. I just wanted to check my altitude for skiing, and even when I figure it out, I have to read the manual the next time I ski"
1,mailing,"Since its been a month and the store has yet to send me the watch its a little hard to rate a non existent item. Im sure the watch is awesome, but the store sucks. Dont buy from it"
1,Techno watch that is not backlight,Incredible that a manufacturer can produce a watch that is not backlight. That means at night the watch is not illuminated hence the watch can not be read. It requires you to push a button for 2 seconds and then the watch will illuminate for a whole five seconds before it goes dark again. I thought they invented this technology in the 80's. The watch was a pain in the ass to use at night and almost worthless and I ended up sending it back.
4,Fun Watch!!,I gave this watch to my fiance & he has really enjoyed tracking our altitude gain on bike rides. I've appreciated knowing the temperature. Can't wait for ski season!
2,Quit working after seven months,"I bought this watch approx the end of May last year. At the first of January the numbers would fade away when I pressed the light button. I assumed the battery was going bad and replaced it. The problem was that I was home on leave, my last day. I returned to Afghanistan and the watch started to zero out. I would wear it for a few hours and the time would go to zero and flash. It will no longer keep time. I have not abused the watch as the price I paid for it is a little steep and I would not take the chance on destroying it.When I looked online to return the watch, I found that I have to send it to the nearest service center with the receipt for purchase. I am in Afghanistan, this is not an easy option for me. I loved the watch when it was working, but now it just sits in a footlocker. Way too much money for gear that you cant use!"
2,This Watch Functions Okay But Dies an Early Death,"The watch generally works okay for backpacking and higher altitude hiking (my uses) until it fails. One quirk: The ones I have had always understate the altitude by 100-200 feet after climbing more than a few thousand feet. The error compounds above 10,000 feet even if you adjust the master settings. That I am on watch number five over a 12 years period is the problem: these watches fail sooner rather than later. The plactic that holds the crystal in place will crack and leak under normal use. The watch will get permanently stuck in a setting. The electronics will just go nuts until they fail entirely. Since I have found no better watch brand than Suunto I rely on my Garmin GPS more and more these days. When the one I have dies (and the case is cracking!),that is it."
4,War,"Rousseau was wrong about the noble savage. Savage, yes. Noble.... well, not so much. This book is an anthropological work on war and violence in pre-history. People who pine for the simple life of ages past should read it. In ages past, you're chances of dying by violence were quite a bit better than they are now. Also interesting ... perhaps most interesting... is the account at the beginning of the book of how a preconceived notion can blind a reasonable person to the evidence right before his (or her) eyes)."
3,The story is pretty simple,"It doesn't require a book to tell this story. An article would more than suffice. That given, the book is well written and convincing with lots of detail to back up the author's thesis."
2,Doubts about the author's intentions,"It was too descriptive for my expectations. (methods of war, motives, details etc.) and didn't concentrate more on the anthropological aspects. Are we destined to eternal hostility embedded in our animal origin or is it possible to cure it by civilisation and reason ? I didn't finish the book to find out what the author wanted to say."
2,He's wrong,"Recent archaeological data in SA shows clearly that war did NOT start civilisation. That myth has offically been dispelled, itself! So, although on the one hand, it's right to not talk about altruistic primitive people, it is also WRONG to suggest that it has been the only constant. HISTORY almost never jives with ARCHAEOLOGY, and we don't care about his letters, we, as archaeologist, care about the actual DATA."
2,"Not the best, but still fun to watch.","In the first episode we meet a seeker of the Grail, a man who believes to be cursed and a creature that hides in a Vorlon suit. The attempt to introduce the Grail lore to the series is not a successful one, but the episode has a few good moments, most of them around a hideous mind absorbing creature.""Eyes"" was a complete disappointment. Sinclair is facing court martial, but the plot is much too thin."
4,A Great Portrayal of Domestic Abuse and It's Vicious Cycle,"As a Domestic Violence Specialist I found this book to be like a snapshot of a day of advocates, counselors and the victims' life in a center or shelter. The characters were so realistic and you could relate to each peron's personality. The title accurately states how most victims, survivors, and batterers feel about this epidemic in our community. It's ""Nobody Business"" yet almost everyone knows someone or is experiencing a domestically violent relationship. Although it is a Fiction writing, it can be used to teach others how the staff and volunteers can get caught up in this cycle, too! A good read!!! You can easily finish this book within a couple of days or one good marathon night of reading. So buy it as a gift for some one or treat yourself. Then snuggle up to Ms. Simmon's book about functional and dysfunctional relationships and expect to be intrigued!"
5,One of the Best Ska-Punk Albums There is.,"IT just doesn't get much better than this. Every single song on this cd is upbeat, fun, loud, exciting, and darn catchy. Alll the songs have the perfect mix of punk and ska. Just enough punk and just enough ska. I love it. It's also perfect party music to jam too. I really enjoyed this album."
2,I have to disagree.,"I guess if you don't really care about sound quality then this is a good album. Seriously, there is a lot to be desired when it comes to this. It is the album that I own that is the worst mastered, by far. This isn't important to some people, I guess? Aside from that, they're not a bad Ska-Punk band, although they sound an awful lot like Less Than Jake. Also, the song ""Alternative Radio"" is sort of contradicting...aren't they somewhat alternative?"
4,Get-It,"Ok lets start off that Slapstick released this album after they broke-up. Because they became more popular after they broke-up with the full length LookIt! No longer is LookIt! still avalible to buy, all of the songs on that cd are on this one with a few more new songs on it also. I Gave it 4 stars because I got lookIt! then got this album and it just was boring. But the new songs are good, and if you don't have LookIt! then get this now! You will love Slapstick, good Punk-Ska. And if you really like them, buy the Slapstick movie where they played their last show ever, even after they broke up!Check out my other reviews"
5,Like This Calculator,"My aunt bought me this for x-mas last year. It is okay. When I need it for ath and wanna make sure I look good for my crush I look in the mirror and solve the problem. I like this item alot. I think you should buy this item. Make your kid solve math problems, look cute and have fun."
5,So Put-Together,"This CD is so incredibly listenable. It's so interesting and refined. I can listen to it over and over. I also have volumes 1 and 2, and this is my favorite. Totally awesome.It is fairly up-tempo."
3,"""Grown folks Hip-Hop""","Trip-hop, (""old-skool, hip-hop without fowl lyrics,"") blended with mushroomy jazz notes. If love both yet never heard the two together you are in for a treat. He is a master at what he does. In my opinion, 2 was the best, then 1 then 3."
3,"was he a hero, or did he leave his fmaily behind",I had to read kaffir boy for school. after reading the back i was very intriged. i liked the beginning. the second section was good and the last disappointed me. at first i thought of him as a deprived boy who wanted a better life. then when he started to befriend whites and used them to his advantage i no longer liked him. the book oopened my eyes to apartheid. he did i very good job at descirbing life for him. but he was not a nice person. that made me sad for the human race. i think it is a good book to read for the sake of reading it but please do not base your desicions agauint his.
1,E-X-T-R-A-O-R-D-I-N-A-R-Y!!!,"I read Kaffir Boy, which was a seemingly long time ago, however, it still remains glued into my head. The main character of the book `Kaffir Boy' is Mark Mathabane, who was also the author of the magnificent book. The book portrays the life of an ordinary black boy living in the hatred filled streets of South Africa. The racism described is so well portrayed that it is almost painful; the author (Mark Mathabane) paints a crystal clear picture of what it was like to live at that time, with racism chasing you down. Thanks, Mark Mathabane, for giving me a great book to read!"
4,a fight from school over this book,"I'm in 10th grade. our teacher is having us read this. Then some of the parents found out about the ""sexual activities"" for food. They flipped. Now i would have thought being parent they would be mature about this. it is a book of the past and and our teacher said when we read it we want to try to prevent past from repeating itself. Althought it has some pretty discriminating and discusting parts it is a good book. We must not forget, this happened here. on this earth on which we live on. what happenes to one person(s) can gradualy effect others and still grow. This was a life that had suffered all this, he knows the feeling of it. It's not an experence we want to know of, but the life of this child growing up help others realze, this stuff can go around on this earth all the time and anytime."
5,An example for all of us.,"I could not believe such story could exist, I was shocked every moment I read this book and what is even more intense is that its his own autobiography. The hardships this man had to endure in order to make it into the land we live on, the land we sometimes take for granted. This is a true example of hard work overcoming all obstacles, I would really recommend this book to all young teenagers, it is in a way inspirational for many of us that help us keep going."
5,"""Must-read"" for everyone",Mark Mathabane takes the reader inside his life and helps you to truly feel as he feels. Every member of the human family should experience this book.
5,Great book all round.,This was the first book/thing I read that gave the viewpoint of a South African boy growing into manhood. Great depiction of feelings and description of the circumstances the author went through. Well written.
3,Kaffir Boy: The Balls in his court,"Kerry O'Callaghan... Kaffir Boy by Mark Mathabane was truly an eye-opening novel. The author tells his story about being a young black boy in Apartheid, South Africa, and how they used to think, no matter what, dreams would never be successful for the blacks living there. Mark's father then got a new job, which led Mark to go to school, where he succeeded and started to play tennis. Kaffir boy was an amazing novel that led me to understand things that i had never known before. Hearing about the horrible circumstances that happen every day to Black people, even in their own country, where they should feel safe and at home, but in almost all cases, dont. I would reccomend this book, because I feel that people need to understand whats going on, or what did go on in the world that they live in."
4,Suprisingly Good Book,"When this book was first passed out in my language arts class, I was expecting another boring BLAH classic-type book. I started reading and I couldn't put it down. Mark (Johannas) Mathabane describes his life in apartheid South Africa so well that you feel his pain. I had no idea what apartheid was or how bad South Africa was until I read this book. It is not your usual autobiography, either. Its more like a story. Flows really well and doesn't let you put it down."
4,REQUEST: Kaffir Boy,"My apologies, as this is not a review. I met a South African in the plane from London to Oslo. He told me about the book. I happen to have read about Mark Matabane in the Mail and Guardian; but never bothered to check his works out, as I promised myself to. After watching a CNN programme on 20000623, I felt that I have done myself a disservice by not following up on the matter. Would you be kind enough to provide me with Mark's website address.I work for the South African Embassy in Oslo. I have been thinking of hosting a South African Book Fair...maybe I can include Mark, depending on his availablity and logistics. The plans are still at an infancy stage at the moment.Your assistance will be appreciated. My apologies again.Thivhilaeli Eric wa ha MAKATU 23 A Hoffsjef Lovenskiolds Vei Oslo, Norway"
2,Overwritten and Overrated,"I'm stumped. This memoir is considered a classic, yet there are platoons of unsung memoirs out of Africa that are far superior. Granted,Mathabane wrote this when he was barely out of high school. But still. The writing is laborious and, worse, many of the scenes, particularly those from his very early childhood, feel embellished. A different shade of James Frey? That said, the book gives a sobering, stark picture of Apartheid-era township life in all its horrors and occasional joys."
2,kaffir boy- sick and disgusting for students,"Kaffir Boy was about a boy living under the apartheid laws of South Africa. These laws prevented blacks from doing anything in their community. They had no freedoms, and no hope for jobs to make money to live their lives. Mark Mathebane was the young boy in this book. He talked about his life and how horrible it was. This book was extremely graphic and sick minded for high school students. He gave every detail about how he lived and how he survived. One section of the book that comes to mind is where Mark is getting raped by a man. He gave every single detail that made me want to throw up. In another part of the book, a man made him step in a bucket full of human feases, which is flat out disgusting. This book is horrible in the fact that he or she reading it will have a stomach ache from the gross facts. Not suited for High School students!!"
2,Too graphic and violent for me to recommend,"This was assigned summer reading for my 9th grader and fortunately, I read it first! I do not feel that such graphic desciptions of sex and violence are necessary to portray the circumstances in which Mathabane grew up. I found it a pity, actually, because the story is inspiring yet I could not get past the grapics in the first section. Needless to say, our 9th grader did NOT read this book. As important as it is to educate about the horrors in this world, I firmly believe that if youngsters are given this much graphic exposure we are perpetrating the crime upon their souls. Why can't writers find a way to express themselves in a higher more noble fashion? Then their important stories could be read by all. I can't believe that not one review mentioned this problem!"
1,I found this book very offending,I was rescently assigned this book to read for my Humanities class. When I came upon the part with the young boys being used as sex toys I refused to read anymore. I think that this kind of material is inappropriate for school and should not required to read. I would have given this book no stars but this was not an option.
5,Honest,"This book is one not really like others, first of all, the writer is honest about the things he put in, and he was able to give us a view on what life was like for him. His struggle paid off for him, only because he believed in himself, and loved his family. Great book. I only read it, because of a class project, but I never thought I would like it."
3,Inside Alexandra,"Mark Mathabane spent the first eighteen years of his life living in conditions of unbelievable hardship under the South African apartheid system. Crowded with his family into a squalid dwelling in the township of Alexandra, he spent his childhood battling cold, rats and hunger and with raw sewage pooling just outside the family home. As he grew older and understood the bitter injustice under which his family and community lived, he became motivated to succeed both academically and to improve his increasing tennis skills; always dreaming of winning a tennis scholarship to an American university. He experienced at first hand the draconian pass laws, the institutionalised obstructiveness of petty officials and the fear felt by the black population for the state police and neighbourhood spies.There are graphic accounts of the township riots and the death of so many children which make this a harrowing, though essential, read for anyone interested in the history of the twentieth century."
3,The Full Picture,"This book really is well-researched and contains a wealth of historical information as well as practical travel tips. But it was written by a Hare Krishna devotee and anyone buying it should anticipate an emphasis which reflects this orientation. There are vast sections on Vaisnava temples and saints and less thorough treatment of sages and sites reflecting other persuasions. Thus, you get 37 pages on Vrindaban and Mathura and only 11 on Varanasi. You get elaborate details on ISKCON and its founder Prabhupada and no mention at all of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda or Ramana Maharshi. In short, it lacks balance. But if you are primarily interested in Vaisnavism, it's a great resource."
3,Well..........,"[...]. The book is very comprehensive, and highly recommended for any 'first timer' planning to visit India. Where to stay, what to look out for, etc."
2,"ANDRE DE TOTH, OPUS 30","Bought this 1982 VHS of the film with washed-out colors. Steve Reeves is a bit monolithic but well tanned, Valérie Lagrange's acting abilities should be discussed elsewhere and Panamanian coasts look a lot like the coasts of the Mediterranean sea. Chelo Alonso's dance is however superb. A DVD, sorry, a VHS intended for those of us who were kids in the 60's."
2,MORGAN THE PIRATE,OLD MOVIE. IT WAS FINE. BUT AFTER IT WAS DONE. MY VCR NEVER WORKED PROPERLY AGAIN. I WILL NEVER BUY A USED VHS CASSETTE ONLINE AGAIN
2,Not so Good,"These weights are adjustable by adding and removing sand bags, however the sand bags are not sturdy and tear easily. Also, the sand actually looks like dirt to me and not sand at all. Valeo was great when dealing with customer service. They sent me a brand new set of weights, no questions asked, after I sent them an e-mail and pictures of the sand bags. I hope the replacement holds up better than the originals did."
4,Well-made product,"I bought these to add some additional calorie burning to my brisk walks. At first I was not happy with how bulky they are, but after using them several times, I'm content now. They do the job, and I can add weight if I need to (starting out with 2 lbs per ankle). The velcro is high quality, once you have these fastened on, they ain't going no-where! I bought these to replace some old ankle weights where the buckle was digging into my ankles, no matter how I tried to adjust them (Whiteley ankle weights). These Valeos are great, no digging into my ankle bones while walking, as long as I take a little care in how I put them on initially, but even if I don't, they stay pretty comfy for an hour's walk. They are bulky, but after reading reviews on other similar (less-bulky, nicer looking ankle weights) products about velcro not staying fastened and other issues, I'm happy with these."
4,satisfied,I am very happy with these ankle weights. They fit very securely and seem to be very well built. I use them alot and have had no trouble with them at all.
5,muy bueno,"muy buen producto, la entrega fue a tiempo y sin contrariedades, excelente servicio, el articulo lleno todas mis expectativas, es tal como esta en la foto."
4,Good,I thought the Valeo ankle and Wrist weights are very affordable and great to use when you're trying to exercise. They were on time and i couldn't sa anything else except for thanks and keep up the good work.
3,Not good for wrists,This item is advertised as ankle/wrist weights - they are way too big for wrist weights but as ankle weights they are great.
2,Not what I expected,"The product is ok. It's not great. It's a little bulky to have on your ankles, and is way too bulky for the wrists. The sandbags are difficult to take out and put back into the slots. It would probably work better if you were a bigger person. It's too big and b ulky for me. I'm 5'2"" and under 100 lbs."
4,Excellent Product,I am very happy with this product.Able to adjust to either leg which is great since I have recently had surgery and it helps to augment the physical therapy. I highly recommend this product.
3,Not Exactly What I was Expecting,"I wanted ankle weights to wear during workouts. These weights are so bulky around my ankles, I can't walk or run normally. They are fine for leg lifts and stationary exercises."
2,Much bulkier than expected.,"I find these difficult to use because they are so bulky. I ordered the 20 lb combined. I wish the pictures had shown the product on a person so you could see how massive these are. I like the concept of adjustable weight, but I really don't use these because of the size."
1,Made in China piece of crap,"I've had these ankle weights for 3 weeks, and they plastic lining has already broken and is spilling sand."
3,shipping,"currently on deployment, i got these in less than 2 weeks...just short of a guy on a jet ski meeting the ship in the middle the ocean with the package....very pleased with shipping"
1,Clunky things,"These are heavy, clunky things that are hard to put on. The velcroe strips make this ripping noise, and it's really awkward to make them snug and secure on your ankles. I didn't like them from day one and ended up giving them away. Forget this product."
4,good for walking,"Really, this is a great product for walking, or cleaning, or just being around the house...But don't run with these since they don't stay in place. I like mine, and use them in spurts."
5,What more do you need?,"These weights are easy to use, well-padded, adjustable in 2 pound increments, and should fit limbs of all sizes. Why pay more?"
5,"easy, flexible, great workout!","I got the valeo 10 pound adjustable ankle weights about 6 weeks ago and love them! First of all, it's always useful to be able to adjust the weight to your particular exercise. I find it really easy and quick to exchange the weights several times. They also fit me really well (I'm a woman but rel. big ankles I guess). I use them for different exercises in the house and would NOT recommend to wear these weights on a run, walk or for long times during the day! It is extremely unhealthy for your knees, hips, and evey the spine! Weights like these are supposed to be used for relatively slow exercises in the house only. I've already build up some nice muscles and toned my legs, bum, and abdomen."
3,Average,Product as advertisedI found the 2 velcro straps not to be practicalThe weights I use at my health club are easier to attachOne large strap would be more convenient
3,Too bulky!,"I went to the store fully intending on buying these. I saw the good reviews and was super excited. When I got to the store they had them out on display and I decided to try them on. They are way too bulky! I'm not small either. I'm average sized and these were just too big and uncomfortable. I tried to walk around in them but it was too hard as they kept hitting each other. The material that they are made of isn't soft so they felt abrasive when I was walking around. On a positive note, they have a large velcro strap that will accommodate any sized ankle. They are adjustable and the little sand bags (that's what they look like) are removable so you can add or remove weight to your liking. However, I decided to skip these and went with a pair of Gold's Gym ankle weights."
4,Pretty good for the price,"I've been multi-tasking with these to get a little upper-body strength training in during spinning. They are pretty comfortable on the wrists, but you really have to pull the straps tight to keep them from slipping up and down (I have pretty slender wrists, so someone with bigger forearms probably won't have this issue). I'm a little confused by the double D-ring closure system, which makes it hard to get the straps adjusted, but I'm sure I'll figure out how to use them properly at some point. I do like that the weight packets are evenly distributed along the length of the holder, so that when they do sllip during exercise it doesn't throw off the movement. I'd buy these again."
3,Valeo 10 LB adjustable weights,Bought these to do my physical therapy exercises. Work fine and I like that they are adjustable. They are just annoying to take weights out of and put back in. They are also annoying to put on and get a strong grip if you have small ankles.
2,If you can handle the uncomfortable feeling then the price is ok,I bought these for my son who complained that they were very uncomfortable on his ankles. He doubles up on socks to try to add padding. He wears them none the less and is over all happy enough with the product but if you ask me they should focus on comfort a little more. I would not personally recommend them.
3,Bags of 'sand',"I don't like these for the reason that the 'weights' are plastic bags filled with 'sand'. I did get mine, removed some weight and of course, ONE bag had a small hole....I was leaking sand in the living room. I thought it simple to fix myself, but realized later, I should have just sent back. So if considering this type of product, it may be wise to spend a little more and go to a Chiropractor or Physical Therapist and see if they can order a pair with metal weights."
4,Well constructed but bulky,Well constructed - will last many years - but are bulky and hurt my ankles when I run with them. I think they must be made for walking. Good for wrists. Overall I'm satisfied.
3,Adjustable Weights,These weights are well built and look as if they will last forever. The problem I have with them is that they are a bit difficult to strap on and remove because of the length of the velcro straps.
1,Terrible,"These are terrible...once you take the ""weight"" out of the pocket, it's virtually impossible to put it back in...the strap broke after i used it twice, and the actual removable weight leaks some disgusting black stuff that got all over my floor...not recommended at all!"
3,ankle weight slips during use.,It's impossible to keep it from slipping around on your ankle no matter how tightly you pull the velcro strap. It could have been designed better.
4,good product,"no complaints except the title says 10 lbs, thats both weights together, not ten pounds each!"
4,Quick Review,"Notes:-Won't work on wrists at all-After awhile of usage, it started leaking grains of some type of metalOther than that, it's a cheap and good bye"
3,New style of post-production,"A cynical way to describe this CD would be ""lurching beat with trumpet & saxophone squalling"". Sex Mob sometimes works for me, like on the CD ""Solid Sender"", and sometimes leaves me a little cool, like on ""Dime Grind Palace"". Sexotica leaves me a little on the cool side, though some tracks are definitely hot. This CD was made a little differently. The band, with Mike Dillon on tabla, recording their parts live, and then handed the tapes (or files) to Good & Evil. The music was then re-mixed, and additional sounds were added. For the most part, the Good & Evil additions are kept in the background, and don't distract from trumpet, sax, bass & percussion. If the band is raising a ruckus, there will other ruckus-making sounds added. That's how it was made, but I think it's a three star CD simply because not enough of the songs are strong enough."
1,Bungle In The Jungle,"Nothing chaps me more than squandering $20 on musical dribble, and that's just what I did when I purchased ""Sexotica."" I was still dizzy from Steven Bernstein's ""Diaspora Soul"" (which is truly phenomenal) and, knowing nothing about Sex Mob, decided to drop 20 on the LP. Big mistake. I need to learn to read the editorial content more closely. In this case, Amazon described it as ""playful, mysterious, and seductive."" Apparently, my mind quit there and didn't digest the rest of the sentence: ""yet it's anything but easy listening."" That's an understatement. There is a flash or two of brilliance on the LP, but overall it's like waiting for a fireworks show and getting a single bottle rocket instead."
3,"Private Parts 2, A treat for Phillips fans","Ant left Genesis to go solo and up until Private Parts and Pieces 2, I wondered why. Though the album is wrought with an irritating abundance of acoustic work, there are some rather ambitious electric works as well. I found it to be a little thick but overall a step in the right direction. A little more of the heavy rock stuff would not have hurt this album as Phillips is really an amazing guitarist."
2,Water gets into the placemat easily,Everyone raves about how easy this is to clean and how durable it is. The truth is that the seal separates from the paper inside within a few washes and then the placemat becomes fairly useless. Liked the dinosaur concept; too bad its not well made. Also they should invent these things with suction cups on the bottom so the kid can't sweep it off the table so easily!
1,Boring,"Limp tried to get the crowd pumped up but it seems like they all just wanted to see koRn and none of the other bands. Orgy was one of the boring ones too. Ice Cube was trying to get all the people in to it but didn't seem to have enough crisma. To me Rammstein was great, lots of stage presence like when they did ""BÜCK Dich"" or Bend Over. koRn likes to talk about themselves alot and the road to being famous...."
3,Fun for a while,"I borrowed this from a friend of mine, mainly because I wanted to see Rammstein, and I was somewhat happy with what I got, and somewhat not happy. I'm no fan of Limp Bizkit, hip-hop's not my bag, and Korn had disappointed me enough allready, so what I got was a mixed bag. I have no idea what lurks in the minds of the members of Rammstein (and I don't wanna know), but I am still a fan of theirs, and they played damn good live. I fast forwarded through Limp's set and Ice Cube's, Orgy's set was ok, and Korn's was pretty good, I just wish they would have played more of their old material. It's a pretty good concert/party video, but if you want the ultimate music home video, get any of Pantera's videos or their DVD."
4,It was ok,"It was alright, every part was good except that german band, I forget the name! They ruined the whole thing!"
1,Very bad DVD,"This is one of the worst dvds. The performances are bad and the quality is bad. I like Korn, Ice Cube and especially Rammstein, but there are better dvds featuring these artists than this one. And by the way Rammstein rules, watch their concerts on the ""live aus Berlin"" and ""lichtspielhaus"" dvds and you will see how a live performance has to look like.-> this family values 98 dvd is crap"
5,Family Values rocks the music video world!,"If you like Korn, Limp bizkit, Orgy, or Ice Cube you have to get this video. It has great interviews, sound and an all around great video. The lighting, pictures and screams of fans make you feel as if you where there. A must buy!"
4,"If u missed family values in 98', here's your chance.","This dvd has oustanding footage from the greatest tour in history. Behind the scenes shots and interviews with the bands. For example, you'll see: -Nathan Davis's birthday party (Jonathon Davis's son) -Orgy dressing Korn up like themselves -Interviews with all the artists -A few women getting ""more comfortable"" in Ramstein's dressing room, if you know what I mean -And finally you'll see tons of songs performed live for the Family Values crowd of 98'.A small word of caution for the people youngsters in the house, there are some shots of naked body parts so be careful when ordering for your household. I encourage everyone to purchase this dvd, it really is worth every cent you pay. And what better way to get it cheaper here on Amazon than at the store...? Order it now, you wont regret it."
3,crazy video,rammstein is nasty in this movie. if you have young kids i suggest you dont let them buy/watch this because its very vulgar. i like the other bands like limpbizkit and orgy. the cd to this (sold seperately) is pretty awesome too. in my opinion rammsteins stage show ruined the film.
5,GREAT DVD,"To start off this Dvd does not have full sets by any of the bands. I knew this so I wasnt disapointed. Also note that this dvd is mainly revolving around Korn, seeing as Korn started this tour ,headlined it and was released by their label. Ok, so It really captures the vibe of the whole thing. I think it is an awesome dvd, there is some funny stuff on this also. The best performance was Korn, then Rammstein, then Ice Cube ,then Limp Bizkit. I was really excited to watch this and it was worth the money."
4,family values rock!,"I thought the video was awsome! I have been a big KORN fan since i can remember, and i just thought the video totally kicked. The bands had the crowd pumped and kept them rocking the whole time!"
3,It wuz ok!,"This movie was ok.........it was mostly concert performances and was not nearly as good as Who, The, Now. Buy it if you must, but I sugest you buy who, then, now for KoRn. If your looking for Limb Bizkit, ORGY, Ice Cube, or Rammstein, buy this."
5,Great preformances from all of the bands.,The Family Values video was just as good as seeing the show in concert back October. Every group preformed just as well as they did Halloween night.
3,Worth Watching Not Buying,"This is one to rent. Rammstein's live performance was spectacular. It's hard to outshine them in that area. When Till whiped out his fake dick and hosed down the audience.... I hope that freaked some people out who'd never heard of the band. Crazy kinky psycho Germans. Good stuff.Korn was good too. I loved the All in the Family performance. Definately worth seeing. If you like more than 2 or 3 of the bands, maybe you'd find it worth buying. Like previous reviewers said, there are better DVDs out there for each band. Rammstein fans should definately check out Live Aus Berlin."
1,RAMMSTEIN FANS read this review,"If you're a Korn or Limp Bizket fan, good for you, buy this DVD. You'll love it. If you're a Rammstein fan, think twice. Do you have Live Aus Berlin on DVD and VHS? If not, spend your money on that first. The Live Aus Berlin DVD has an interview, multi-camera, the music video for ""Stripped"" and many others. But the only way you'll see ""Buck Dich"" is to get the uncensored VHS. Family Values has ""Buck Dich"" and ""Du Hast"" but it is bady filmed (with terrible sound quality) and the audience is just annoying. There is barely any backstage footage... no interviews, no commentary ... I'll keep my copy just because I keep anything that Rammstein is in, but if you have no interest in seeing Till kiss a member of Orgy and hear the correct pronunciation of Flake's name... don't bother."
4,better than I though,"With Ice cube being on here I was very IF'y about buying this, Im glad though I did now, there is still mroe than enough other stuff on here, even if you bypass the gangsta' rap! Deffinitly add it to your ROCK collection. This was the video that actually got be fully into rammstein! get their DVD, If you can get past the language barrier, then you will be hooked!"
5,brian HEad Welch is the best koRn is great!!,I think all of the bands are ausome that were on this tour!!! LiMp bizkits cool too!!And the should get 100 stars not just 5!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Black Pearl Case works well,Fits snug and does not increase size of phone at all. Definitely happy with purchase. Only downside is that the cover prtects the keys fully but in doing so hides the glow in the dark feature of the keys. Not a big issue once the keys are memorized and it keeps dirt etc from getting into them.
3,curious george,"My 10-month old daughter does not find them interesting.. i'm going to wait until she's a little older. i'm sticking with books like brown bear, brown bear, twinkle twinkle little star."
5,I love george he's DA BOMB,"Curious George is the best childrens book I have ever read and I belive you should keep making Curious George books.I Love Him. I have got 5 George stuffed animals on 2 are yellow 1 big 1 small, 2 red one both big, and i've got a red 1 it's about 6 inches tall."
5,"My 3 year old grandaughter ""reads' it every day!",My son got this book for his little girl at the library. He renewed it as many times as allowed and she cried when he explained she couldn't keep it any longer. Grandma found it on Amazon and when I gave it to her she was so excited she clapped her hands and hugged it tight! She Loves it! Who knew an old monkey from Africa could make a little girl so Happy?
5,A Lovely Classic,"My kids love this lovely classic and everyday they beg me to read with them.Especially when I read about how Curious George learned the alphabets in a different way,Wow! That's great. I would like to recommend this book for kids who are in pre-K to Grade 3. Thanks for this book. I really love it. You won't find a great book like this Curious George in Southern California."
5,A very beautiful book,This was a present for a five year old boy who loves watching George on PBS and the book is lovely.
5,Memories of old and new,"I absolutely loved Curious George when I was a child. It is so thrilling to watch that same excitement in my 3 y.o. daughter. She practically begs me to read her a story from the book every night. During the day, she loves to flip through the book looking for her favorite pictures. It's not often that children enjoy the same things that delighted their parents as children. I am so happy to able to share these stories with her!"
5,George stays in your mind forever !,"I loved George so much when I was little, even before I could read. My mom bought me one and she ended up buying all the other Georgefs books. Mine were written all Japanese, George's books are everywhere in the world and famous. I am 36 year-old (!) now, I still can remember some of the stories I read and adorable drawings of the books. I think this book even had an influence my ""personality development"" as a child. Good influences such as: be independent, be curious, be creative, be bold, be unique, be humorous, be even a little rebellious, be lovable. Very good chilren's book."
3,Board pages a bit flimsy,"These stories are great. We love Curious George. However, the board books in the box set have thinner and flimsier cardboard pages than the singly-sold board books. They bend easily in my toddler boy's hands (who isn't gentle with books), so I'm saving them for later when he's older."
5,My 3-year old daughter can't sleep without Curious George!,"Every night, my 3-year old daughter has to have the first Curious George story read to her. We've read all the other ones, but the first one is her favorite. It's gotten to the point that I've memorized all the words -- which is exactly my point: I love each and every one of them. Curious George is still every bit as wonderful the hundredth time through! A minor warning: characters in the books, including Curious George, do smoke, which does worry the father in me just a bit. All in all, though, it doesn't get much better than these classics."
1,bad digital presentation,"This review is for the digital version only. I would be happy if it just showed the page as it appears in the print version. Instead the print version page fills slightly more than half the screen and the text is repeated again on the bottom of the screen. We love the digital Dr. Seuss on our ipad. This version is the exact opposite of that, nothing added and the pictures are tiny. Need an option to remove redundant text bar. Pass on the digital edition until they can get this right."
2,Not as good as the new stories,I have purchased several curious george books for my children. These early stories do not have much direction and are not as well written as ones today. I did not read them as a child. My unbias opinion is to skip it.
2,Huge disappointment,"The publisher would do much better offering a pure scan of the original. The eBook format does NOTHING but duplicate the text and images into a jumbled mess.I would have given it 1 star, except for the fact that we love the original material.Shame on Houghton Mifflin for destroying a classic. More evidence that less publisher and more author is just better."
5,Great for Little Ones,"These books were a gift for my 15-month old nephew and he loves them! The entire family knows the books by heart he has us read them so often. And since we're still working on not tearing paper pages out of books, the hard pages make it a lot easier to finish the stories."
5,All our favorites in one beautiful book.,"It's so nice to have all the classic Curious George stories in one, big, beautiful hardcover book. Curious George tales are timeless. This collection would certainly make a nice baby shower gift.Our daughters love when I read these stories, they never tire of them."
5,We love it!,"It's a beautiful book, we just got it in the mail and have already read 2 of the stories in it! the fact that it comes with an audio CD of the stories is also great, my youngest loves listening to it on her cd player, i hear giggling as i write this because George is getting into mischief :)This book is a GREAT buy!!"
3,"""That sailor's eating the phone"" and other peculiar content","My two year-old has just met Curious George. She has never seen anyone smoke a pipe, so she asked ""Why that silly sailor eating the phone?"". She's in no danger of taking up smoking, so I'm not fussed about that content. It is the fact that George's curiosity gets him stuffed into a sack and abducted by the man in the yellow hat, who becomes a father figure to George, that most disturbs me. Am I the only one who is made uneasy by this occurence? Here is the man in the yellow hat, eventually presented as George's friend, but he proves himself first to be a tricky person."
3,Dull and strange,"I read a couple of these to my daughter, and they are ok. But one really struck me as uncomfortably strange - ""George goes to the moon"". It is about curious george taking part in experiments in space - and how much fun he has doing so.I looked for another in the series say ""curious george and the polio vaccine"" or ""curious george volunteers to visit the vivisectionists"" or even ""curious george and the bush meat trade"".I understand why we need to experiment on animals. But there is something wrong in us pretending to kids that it's fun for the animal."
4,Excellent books - though a little out-of-date context wise,"My child loves this collection and so do we. The only issue we found is that the book has a few pictures with people smoking a pipe. Obviously a book written in today's day and age wouldn't have such references. It is funny how the baby sort of picked up on the pictures with some character smoking (eg. George Takes a Job). However, the books are still entertaining and so well illustrated."
2,Better to get the full length stories,"My 2 1/2 year old son doesn't really get into these; instead, he really likes when we read him the full length stories. I don't recommend this set - go with the books and save your money."
5,a classic still!!!!,I brought this book for my 3 year old son. It has become the go-to bedtime story book.This is just like the curious george that I remember as a child. The illustrations are colorful and the info on the authors complete with photos were a plus for me. I recommend this for everybody.
2,Too heavy for kids to hold,"This book is great in that it has all of the Curious George stories in one place. Unfortunately, that makes it incredibly heavy and hard to hold with a squirming kid on your lap.I'd buy a set of the individual books, even at a higher price.On the upside, my daughter loves the George stories and wants them read to her nightly before sleep. We've had to learn how to read portions of each book to keep her interested and awake."
4,Books,"Nice little set of board books. Sturdy for little ones. They were very small and had their own holder but was disappointed when I saw that they weren't full size books. My fault, as I assume I missed that in the description."
5,Aztec Camera,I've loved him for years. This order was to replace my damaged one. I definitely recommend this CD.
1,The worst phone ever!,"This is the worst phone. It kept falling off my desk, it never hung up, and it only worked for a minute. My mom even threw it away! She never throws any electronics away! My whole family got annoyed! I VERY STRONGLY RECCOMEND THAT YOU DO NOT, I REPEAT: DO NOT BUY THIS TOY! I would rate it -900000000 but they didn't have that number which is why I gave it one star, unless they did have -900000000 as a rating number. I HATE THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! }:{"
2,PRETTY BUT NOT SENSIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!,"Thought it would be a cute toy for a little girls room yet WORK AS A NORMAL PHONE!!! I mean, it was not free! The phone is too small, makes lots of horrible squealing sounds and FALLS all the time; cord is too heavy. Pretty, but not worth the money because she does NOT want to use it!"
1,BUY A REAL PHONE INSTEAD,"Well, there's not much good I can say about this phone. First, the phone receiver is so tiny that only a very small child could hold it to their ear and still be able to talk into the mouth piece. Second, the phone is so oddly shaped....lip-shaped...that it is IMPOSSIBLE to prop the phone on your shoulder and talk. It slides off your shoulder. It is EXTREMELY uncomfortable to hold because of the shape of the receiver. It is like holding a lip-shaped rock to your head. If you move the receiver the slightest while talking, the sound is GREATLY EXAGGERATED and is heard in the receiver. The phone turns over VERY easily. If you pull on the phone cord while talking, the phone WILL turn over. In all, if your child wants a Bratz phone, check out the other Bratz phone model. I haven't seen it, but it at least looks like a more comfortable phone to use."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!,I got this phone 4 christmas and the head peice is to small and it always falls and the cord is too heavy so think its cool its a night mare gone worse!!!!
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"I bought this phone for my 8 year old and she loved it...UNTIL we plugged it in, the handset wont stay on the base good therefore the phone wont stay hung up. The sound on it is very scratchy, and now she has to keep it in her room unplugged until she wants to use it, so we dont miss other phone calls. 100% JUNK!"
2,Do not buy unless you want your phone of the hook the whole time,"I got this toy for christmas. i set it up a couple days later and it worked perfectly.i called some family just in case.Then when ever i was done using it, it wouldnt stay on the bottom lip. I finally found out that every time i woke up it was of the hook. Ive had it ever since and was never able to use it.C.G."
1,So HARD to talk on.,"I bought this phone as a Christmas gift for my daughter and I was so disappointed. She, nor I could even talk on it becuase of it's odd shape! You can't hear the other person talking because of it and they can't hear you! It just felt so awkward. Plus, it's like trying to put a puzzle piece together when your trying to hang it up. Do Not Purchase!"
4,Meticulously researched photo study of Gettysburg,An excellent and suprisingly absorbing photo record of the Gettysburg battlefield. Frassanito using exacting research and the bloodhound qualities of a detective precisely places and orients the famous Civil War photos of Gettyburg. In the biggest coup of the study he finds that some of the most renown photos were actually made around the Rose Farm and not McPherson's Wood. As the title indicates this book does seem to draw the reader back to the instant in time frozen by the camera way back in 1863-66. Coming across this book by pure chance it was with suprised pleasure that I read and studied the poinant photos.
4,Great behind-the-scenes look,"This is a great book for a peek behind the scenes of the show... in 1990. The tryout process has changed a bit, with the online testing taking the place of sending in a postcard and hoping to be invited to a test, but I can't imagine too much has changed in the production process (especially the strict segregation of clue writers and contestants).The meat of this book is the 10 or so actual games printed in the book, though it's unfortunate that the answer pages (well, technically, the ""question page"", am I right?) are not marked in such a way that you can easily avoid accidentally spoiling your playing along. As another reviewer has mentioned, given the fact that this book is now 22+ years old, some of the clues are dated, but they seem to have done a good job of choosing clues that have stood the test of time.All in all, this book and the Jeopardy! DVD are great gifts for the fan or aspiring contestant."
3,"Good book, somewhat dated.","Not a bad jeopardy book. Since it is 15 years old, the questions can be a bit dated sometimes."
5,Detailed Study,"I really cannot add much to the glowing reviews of this book, but I can subtract from them by stating that Elting is very much on Napoleon's side in his examination of the Grande Armee. This is no great crime, especially in light of the predominantly British viewpoint of Napoleon found in most English volumes, but it does mean that one will need to look elsewhere for a truly objective work. That aside, this book does give the best structural overview I have seen of Napoleon's army (without diagrams and illustrations)"
3,"Good, but not without mistakes","Elting certainly knows a lot about Napoleon's armies, but this work is far from flawless. The author can tell you what a certain corporal's function and pay was, but he mis-states facts concerning some battles and regiments. While many readers may think that this book is the best on the subject of Napoleon's armies, it cannot come close to Alain Pigeard's masterful work, L'Armee Napoleonienne 1804-1815."
3,Generalization,"The problem with thick books that try to capture large subjects is that they must generalize and leave out a lot of data, and here there is no difference. If you are looking of a general overview of the Grande Armee during more then two decades of the French First Republic and Empire, this book will inform. However it is not meant to provide or be a definitive statement on any of the topics discussed in the chapters. Its a guide, rather then a scholarly work. This is particularly true where armies other then French are discussed, or where equal space has been given to its largest corps, the Infantry or Cavalry.Other works dealing with specific areas should be consulted after readin this work."
4,Not the typical Napoleon biography,"Swords Around a Throne is not your typical Napoleon book. Elting concentrates on topics which MAY rate a sentence or paragraph in other biographies. Elting concentrates on the different divisions of the Grand Armée including uniforms, in-depth looks at his marshals and the navy instead of regurgitating the different battles he fought. Swords Around a Throne is a good change of pace to the other biographies of Napoleon as it provides a different aspect to the Napoleonic Wars and his empire. Well worth the time to read."
1,NOT compact head. AVOID,"This item is false. It says in the title that it is COMPACT HEAD, so I ordered 10, as compact head toothbrushes are hard to find. Shipping is very expensive. When I received the toothbrushes, they were NOT compact head, instead they are standard head. I cannot use these toothbrushes. Because this is a MARKETPLACE seller, I have to pay the return shipping if I return them, making these the most expensive toothbrushes ever. American RX is a very unreliable company. I would avoid doing business with them. A deceitful Amazon page"
5,I'm on cloud 9,"I absolutely love these shoes! They are so comfortable. If I had more gray in my wardrobe I would definitely wear these shoes everyday! I use them to walk in or run in! I have 2 additional pairs that I bought before buying these ones. I definitely recommend these shoes if you like comfort! For the price I paid, they were a steal!"
1,Not for beginners....,"I was hoping that this book would help me in making the type of spread sheets I need for my job as a teacher. If anything, this book confused me even more about EXCEL. It did not answer one question I had. I plan on donating this book to my local library. It will get more use there."
5,Excellent tip and explained in plain english,The learning starts at the very beginning. It's full of very usefull example.
5,A Must Have Book,"This is by far the best book I have referenced on Excel. Tutorials are excellent and easy to follow. Mr. Excel has always made learning Excel easy and informative. I really enjoy watching his TV segments on Call for Help. If you must have one book to help you learn and understand Excel, then this, without a doubt, is the book for you. Get it, you won't be sorry!"
5,Real Help for Real Problems,"Bill Jelen has really outdone himself this time! If you are looking for a resource that solves hundreds of real-life Excel problems in a step-by-step format, this is the book for you. By laying out each scenario from start to finish--from problem to solution--this book allows you to immediately zero in on just the material you need at any given moment. And chances are that whatever problematic situation you're in, Bill has it covered. Comprehensive, enjoyable to read, and easy to understand, this is a book you'll definitely want to keep at your fingertips."
5,Amazing Book easy to learn Excel from the Best,Bill really explains things in this book in plain english and makes it easy to understand. Bill is easy to get in contact with as well for any extra questions and even let some of us sample the book before it was released. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn Excel!
5,Love those Dobes!,"I hadn't seen these movies in a very long time. It was fun to see them again, this time with grandkids. I love to watch those beautiful dogs! These are good movies for kids, who will find the dogs quite remarkable and entertaining, and will see that crime does not pay. Although there was initially a problem with my order, the seller was REALLY GREAT and made the order good ASAP so I have NO complaints, only PRAISE!"
5,Double the Dobermans Double the Fun,These two movies are great fun to watch and see how movies were back in the 70s and 80s. This movie is hard to find and DVD and it is nice to have 2 of the 3 movies in one box. Just wish they had a booklet inside about the movie.
5,Love it,I first saw this movie when I was a kid. I wanted to share it with my kids. They love it as much as I do!!!
3,Ripe for a Disney remake,"There are scenes I love: some of the dog training, one dog helping another, dogs recovering the loot, the English bulldog, gasoline at ~37 cents a gallon, the final ending. And scenes I don't like that are very disturbing: dogs attacking/biting people, dogs and children being whipped with leash. Although the doberman breed was unfairly characterized, it was ultimately shown that the breed is not as described. The dobermans, the boy, the dobermans, the English bulldog, the dobermans, I would watch it again, and again just to see my favorite scenes if I could remove the violent ones I find so objectionable. The story lines have great potential for, as I say in the review title, a 'Disney' movie. These movies are not for children, but they could have been."
4,Whack or Wacky?,"Kuenstler Treu is one-half of the Berlin electronica duo DAUERFISCH. Having done a few 12-inches and a full-length on the Harvest/EMI label that barely reached the US, the good Kuenstler Treu (German for ""artist true"") uses found parts on MY SKETCHBOOK OF WHACK, breathing new life into these musical cliches to create a stylish new pop-monster. Favorite tracks are ""Who's Your Boogie Beau,"" ""Poara Nuestros Creativos"" (featuring samples from a Spanish spoken word self-help record), and the Zappaesque ""Low on Sugar."" If you like Tipsy, Dipstick or DJ Me DJ You, then Kuenstler Treu is your man..."
2,"I did buy second hand, but was literally worn out","I had to buy this book because my son wanted it so bad... (He now knows how to surf the amazon.. so problem..)Book is good, but never again going to be second hand.. Book was so worn out that the cover paper tore off on the first day."
5,It's really pretty and sporty at the same time,"I purchased the ember colored one, and it's a great natural fall color. Its sturdy and soft, so I plan to keep warm and stylish. I think the thumb holes are strange, but they don't detract enough for me to care."
5,Waited for years!,"Horton Foote's trilogy was produced for PBS years ago. It was called ""The Story of a Marriage."" The first in the series has now been released as ""Courtship,"" the second is on ""Valentine's Day"", and the last is ""1918"". Horton Foote who is one of America's greatest writers paints a wonderfully accurate portrait of the slow pace of Texas life in the early part of the 20th century. What might seem slow pacing to those used to action-packed drama, is really Foote's beautifully sparce but meaningful language. This was a time when gentility mattered above all else. As was the case in small southern towns, the odd and eccentric were protected and cared for by the town, while hopefully kept out of sight. Foote embraces the damaged and the frail, weaving their lives along with those of the main characters, to portray a quiet tale of compassion, love and strength of character. The characters will stay with you forever."
3,a title for my review,"i didn't think it was as good as the first 'misfits of ska'. it's still not a bad ska comp, by any means. if you like ska, you'll like this cd."
5,NO STINK,This is a refill to the ultimate kitty waste removal system. It is similiar to a diaper genie where you just put the waste in there turn it and it does not smell in the box. This is great . Now I only have to empty the locker every few weeks.
4,long lasting,"Like I mentioned in the actual Litter Locker review, these cartridges do last for a while so you don't have to purchase these too often."
5,essential equipment,essential to keep your cat odors locked away. I panic if I run out of replacement filters because that means I'm back to the daily grind of scooping into grocery bags and then making the trek to the dumpster.
4,not bad,"I was intrigued by the concept of Eno and Moby getting together (and this was in 1992 when they did this..Moby's ""Go!"" was still a major club hit,and I was spinning it at clubs then, but very few people knew who he was otherwise) to do some work, and in some places (""Fractal Zoom"" is the only track, but mixed and whatnot a dozen or so ways, Mody involved on more than 1/2 of them) it works out nicely.Ultimately, the 2 could have spent more time together, perhaps helping Eno get a better basic track made from which to base these remixes.For Eno fans and Moby fans, this cd is certainly a curio, but not as groundbreaking as it could have been..I would love to see them try to do this project again, now that Moby is supersaturating the AOM charts- maybe it will help Eno gain a new fan base who can respect his music."
5,Eno's take on minimalism,"I didn't know what to expect with this cd. Eno tries everything! I have always loved his catchy hooks, infectious rhythms and thought-provoking (or mind-numbing) lyrics.This cd is not ambient music, and it is not some form of heady satirical/lyrical rock. What it comes closest to is his take on minimalism, as apparently repetitive patterns are laid out, but slowly transform in different ways (not so repetitive after all!). It isn't dance music exactly, since it isn't that intense -- but it isn't entirely vacuous either. In my opinion, it's a welcome in-between: music to drift in and out of, while doing something else. I can sink into it at moments, or let it go on without me. It sparks my imagination without dominating my thoughts, and that's just what I was hoping for when I bought it."
2,= so-so (bought it in 1992),"This is a single - one song spread across remixes (how fractal!) While this CD is not necessarily irritating in any way, it IS rather bland. Instead of discovering some wonderful piece of groundbreaking bizarre ""FRACTAL"" music, I ended up with a mediocre, familiar-sounding, semi-dancey single. (Don't expect eno ambience). I sold it."
4,"""STUDIO SET""","Marcos Witt Is Primarily Known For His Live Recordings But Here, He Brings Us A Complete Studio Set Showing He Can Sing (Opposite What Others Might State).Amoung The Notables: He Starts Off With ""Tu Gracia Me Sostiene"" (Pop/Rock) Stating God's Grace Sustains Us; ""Me Asombra Tu Amor"" (Pop) Which Is My Absolute Favorite & ""La Fuerza De Tu Amor"" (Rock Ballad).The Ballads ""El Ha Sido Fiel"",""Te Mire A Los Ojos"" & ""Es Por Ti"" All Speak Of God's Love & Faithfulness And The Reason We Are. They Show Witt's Passionate Side.Definately One To Have If Your A Witt Fan or Fan 2 B."
3,Good shoes but doesn't fit true to its size,I liked the shoes and it looks very good with good material. The work is nicely done for the shoes. Good shoes for the money with a caveat.The shoes doesn't fit true to its size and to me that's a defect. All of my shoes are 9M but I had to re-order 9.5M for this shoes. Please consider 0.5 size more than your normal shoe sizes.
4,Sturdy,Very good quality item. I'm very satisfied with this purchase. I also saw same model on Clarks shop. It's little narrow for my duck feet. Choose wide fit if you have the same problem I do.
1,Might as well wear iron,"These are most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn. I understand that there is a break in period for leather, but you can't possibly wear these enough times to ever break them in (if they ever do). I feel like I have two boards strapped to my feet. They pinch in the heel and leave blisters within a few hours. The manufacturer may want to condition, rub 'em or whatever to make these a bit softer before they sell them."
4,Nice shoes!!,"Pros:- Shoes look shiny and beautiful. Very elegant, too. Having seen them on a Bostonian store, I knew the way they would look, so no dissapointment (nor surprise) there.- After four three weeks of use, they are still holding up good, with no visible crevices or lines. Hopefully, that will last for long!Cons:- Pricy."
2,RIP OFF,"LUVS diapers are GREAT, never had an accident and my baby;s sensitive bum is not bothered by them at all. But for 35$ this is a huuuuuge rip off, you can buy the she pack at walmart for 6$"
5,Great diapers!,"I was really doubtful to try these diapers because of all the bad reviews. I usually use pampers but they are really exspensive so I decided to try a box of Luvs! They come from the same company. Well, it's been a week that my twins have been using these diapers and I haven't come across a leak yet. So far so good. I guess every baby is different. My twins can't use Huggies. For them it leaks! You just have to try different diapers until you find the best one for your baby. I find Luvs to be great on my babies. They are also such a good price."
3,some useful tips...,"I bought the lonely planet travel photography guide a few years ago and absolutely loved it! I learned a lot of the basics and really improved my ""photo taking"" skills. Therefore I was very excited when i found out about the publication of this book. However this people photography guide was disappointing. It provides some useful tips on taking photographs of people but the photos inside the book are not particularly inspiring. Some are good but many are just so-so. (whether one likes a photo or not is very subjective, in my view, but the photos inside this book are really not that exciting. may be i was expecting more from an expert in the field)"
5,Gotta love them shows about prison,"After hearing everyone from radio, tv, the net say that this is a ""Must Watch,"" I decided to get the DVDs and go on one of them viewing marathons again.So I did and I'm glad I bought and watched Season 1. I'm always intrigued by anything that has to do with prison, especially ones where someone is trying to break out like Shawshank Redemption. You know they're going to escape, but ""how"" they're going to escape is the fun part. This show isn't only about prison, it has to do with corruption and conspiracy in the government.All in all, it is a ""Must Watch."" Now I'm hooked on Season Two."
4,Fantastic,I got hooked from the beginning and each episode left you hanging. There was a lot of intrigue to keep your interest. I recommend it highly.
4,"Pretty Good, But...","I thought this show was one of the most gripping, maybe even the most tense thing I can remember watching on TV, perhaps ever. I am not going to elaborate too much on what happens, but it is very exciting, the actors do a great job in their roles and the writing is outstanding. Just a few negatives though. Fully realizing this is not reality but fiction, I really hope most prison guards are not this evil and conversely not that ignorant of such a big scale breakout(relatively speaking). There were many times when I rooted solely for the bad guys because the guards were so vile and mean(beatings, extortion, killing an inmates cat for no good reason). The warden was pretty fair, but those guards. Check this out, because the positives far outdistance the negatives here."
5,"GOOD, or BAD?","This has to be the best show I have ever watched in my entire life. Reading peoples 1 and 2 star reviews made me realize how critical people have to be. I think if your looking for a show that can keep your attention and keep you guessing, this is where you want to begin. Season 1 of Prison Break was FANTASTIC!"
5,AMAZING TV SHOW / AWESOME TRANSFER !!!,"I saw it on TV while ago... but had nothing to do with this spectacular sound and video. Crystal clear, very good sound, plus deleted scenes and bonus material. A must have on every private colection."
5,Superb!,"This is the best TV series yet! It is done so well that you feel as though you're watching an extended movie...a great movie at that. The performances are topnotch, the suspense palpable."
5,great series,"I have loved watching Prison Break, it is hands down one of the best TV series I've seen. Captivating, thought provoking and the actors were incredible. I highly recommend it."
5,Gripping,"This show was recommended by a friend. We bought the set to watch on the way to and from Hawaii. We were hooked, we would have finished it both ways but our DVD player ran out of batteries! I highly recommend this set. Can't wait for Season 2 to come out on DVD!"
5,Prisonliscious - no show has ever made prison more appealing!,"Brilliant! So good in fact, that I had to watch it all again straight away. Compelling viewing, beautifully shot and enacted, with just enough light relief to allow breathing to continue when the suspense makes you hold your breath. The only bad thing about it, was that it ended. I eagerly await Season 2 with baited breath!"
5,Great Show!,"We've watched the whole series of ""24"" and ""Burn Notice"" and now we're on this and love it! Can't wait for next season!"
5,Totally addicting,"I decided to start watching Prison Break because I wanted an Amazon Instant show I could get into and a friend recommended it to me. It is fantastic. It's so hard to only watch one episode at a time because each episode ends with a cliffhanger. The plot takes twists and turns that you wouldn't expect, keeping you on your toes. There are a few plot holes along the way, but it's easy to overlook them because the show is so compelling."
5,Awesome,Prison Break Rules! I got so hooked I couldn't stop watching it. I can't wait till Season 2 comes out.
5,Mykrodotz,PHENOMONAL!! Surely one of the best shows ever created. This show is put together so well it will have you begging for more! A must-see!!!
4,good but not outstanding,"In the beginning of the season the story is very exciting, but the closer the season final comes the story gets more and more long-winded. Nevertheless Prisonbreak is a good buy for people who like tv series like 24."
3,Be careful! Package is wrong!!,"Japanese and French are included in the back of the package.However, it is random at all.Only English enters the voice.Naturally, there are not Japanese subtitles either."
5,What a Great DRAMA!,This is one of the greatest Drama's that I have ever watched. It is one of those movies that keeps you coming back for more. You can't wait to pop the next DVD in when the first one finishes. You will get hooked on this Drama! I recommand it 100%!
4,Oz + 24 = Prison Break,This is one of the show that you cant stop yourself from watching itepisode after the otherits the cool story in HBO Ozand the action in 24but this by far better than 24
2,Prison Break Season 1,"I rented the first season after watching Deadwood and Rome Seasons 1-2. Prison Break was truly a disappointment. After suffering through the first 10 episodes I couldn't take any more. Here is where I felt Prison Break falls short; it's just not believable, the acting and characters are average. I couldn't take it!"
2,not happy,i got the product on time. the plastic holding the dvds in place were broken and the dvds were flying everywhere in the case. luckily all the dvds worked.
5,series,This was also a christmas gift and my niece loved it.I really dont understand why a young girl would want this series but she did
5,Unique and Brilliant,This is by far one of the most unique and brilliant shows to come along in a very long time. The cast is amazing. What would seem like a simple concept is developed in an elaborate and creative way. The story draws the viewer in to the point that you CANNOT turn away. The characters are dynamic and engaging in every aspect. This is a series that could go the distance as one of the finest EVER.
5,"Prison Break, one of the greatest shows...","If you never watched Prison Break or 24, ur seriously missing out on some of the greatest shows ever..."
3,Ok,"All dics came with no scratches but there was no case for all the discs to go into. So I have 6 dvd cases floating around seperatley. Wish it came with a ""box"" for the set to go into for tidiness."
5,Pure genius from everyone involved,"I can't get enough of this show. Watch the pilot episode, you will be hooked! Pure genius from everyone involved!"
5,Great Run,I thought it was so good to be able to watch at my own convenience what happened the first season.
2,"4 seasons, really?","I just couldn't watch all the way through. The acting is okay, cinematography is very good, but the story line is just so far fetched. Most of what is put forth in this script is just implausible. Unbelievable. I can enjoy an adventure but it has to be something close to reality.What irks me is a program like this makes it through four seasons while so many other much better programs are cut after the first season."
4,Received as stated,This product was received and met all expectations. The seller said it would be shipped 'like new'. It was sent in perfect condition. The only thing it was missing was the factory plastic wrap. The discs played perfectly and order was received before the expected shipping date.
5,VERY INSPIRATIONAL. WILL KEEP YOU IN TUNE WITH GOD.,"FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LOVE TO SAY, THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF THE BEST IN GOSPEL MUSIC. THE SONG ""RIDE WITH JESUS"" MAKES YOU STOP AND THINK ABOUT YOUR HOLY WALK WITH GOD.ONLY IF YOU'RE WALKING RIGHT, WILL YOU BE ABLE TO RIDE WITH JESUS WHEN HE RETURNS. AFTER EVALUATING YOURSELF WITH HIM AND FEEL YOU'RE NOT WITH HIM TOTALLY, THEN THE SONG ""ONE MORE CHANCE"" IS VERY FITTING. THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST ON THE CHART. IF YOU WANT TO MEDITATE ON GOD WITH SOME MOTIVATING, GOOD GOSPEL MUSIC, THEN THIS IS THE ALBUM YOU NEED!!!!!!!!"
2,No thanks...,"These are definitely not my thing. The chocolate and toffee flavor is WAY too strong; if I'd have wanted hot cocoa I would have ordered it! However, if you're a big fan of gas-station cappuccinos - these may appeal to you?"
1,"no flavor, nice smell","VERY weak, in fact it was the last hope I had for my machine, which I am selling next week in a yard sale. It was the color of tea. Very bad."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A nasty dystopia that is definitely a little bit closer today.A completely stratified society has the whole bread and circuses thing going, with all sorts of deadly reality tv type entertainments to keep people occupied.A young man of the underclass has a very sick child, and in order to get money to make her well, decides to try and enter one of these game shows.He ends up in the lethal Running Man game, that no-one has ever come out of alive, and has to find a way."
4,What a difference from the movie!!,"I held off reading this book, foolishly thinking that I already knew the story because I had seen the movie years ago... boy was I wrong!If you're avoiding this book because you saw the movie, buy it and read it. It is completely different than the movie. The only thing common between the two is the Running Man game and it is set in the future. It is much more of a social commentary than an action movie, so don't wait..."
3,If you're not a Stephen King fan....,"Not supernatural at all, but briefly psychological, like a number of his books. I believe all Bachman books explored the human spirit to some degree, and this one offers the concept of love over life, and of course, pride. The world he sets is very gray, but his writing style has always been light. An easy read, one designed for the non-King fans."
3,"Watch out for the spolier in ""The Importance of Being Bachman"" intro","I am only leaving this review for one purpose, to warn you about a spoiler in the intro. Don't worry I am not going to spoil it for you to. In the intro by King called The Importance of Being Bachman, he quite literally tells you the ending. It took a lot of the fun out of the book, and I just wanted to let others know that the spoiler was in there."
4,Pending Cenorship?,I read this book when I was a young teen and I like it still as a good indication of Stephen King's still developing talent when it was written. I only hope that this work doesn't share the same fate following 09/11/01 that The Rage did following Columbine.
3,Great initial plot.. frustrating ending,Loved the book all the way through to the last chapter. Could not put it down but the lat chapters just ruined it for me. Really irritating
5,Fantastic!,"I am a dedicated S.K. reader, and i have read probably 25 or so of his countless books. I have to say that the books by ""Richard Bachman"" may be his best works. 'The Running Man' is very gripping, and i read it on a plane ride from NY to AZ. I started at takeoff and finished during the descent- and I have to say that it was one of the few S.K. books that I was sad to have end. It was well thought out, and it made me want to kneel down before the good lord and pray that this isn't what the future holds.All in all, if you just starting to read Stephen King, this is the one to start out with. It's not as far-fetched as some of his other books, and it will make you want to read more and more.Buy it. Read it. You won't regret it."
5,"A great plot, combined with humor, and tremendous excitement","Well, short, but effective. That is what Stephen King chose in one of his thrillers, the Running Man. The theme of the story, is so creative and exciting ; that it takes you to believe everything Ben Richards says (The main character). Simply, the book if not one of the best, the best I have ever read. I myself, I am a 13 year old kid who loved the book. I understood it too. I plan to read a lot more of these books...."
5,I ran through the pages at a mile a minute.,"This novel kept me reading. It was the first of many Stephen King books that I have read, and as a freshmen to the KING genre, that I now realize goes far beyond just being horror, it delivered to me one thing I did not expect, namely action. With this action came a series of characters that were as likable as they were realistic. The only thing for which I deducted a point was the movie for which it was based. If you have seen the movie don't think for a minute that it shares anything with the book except a name"
4,Great Book,"This book is about Ben Richards. In the year 2025 he goes on a game show called ""The Running Man"" because he needs the reward money to pay for his daughter's medical bills. On ""The Running Man"" they send people out on the streets and hunt them down. If the people survive for a month they get 1 billion dollars. There was one part of this book that I really liked, the ending. It was perfect, it was the only way to bring ""The Running Man""(as in the TV show) to justice."
1,Did not like it,"The Running Man may have a plausible future, it may have a realistic character, and it does have suspense. But I didn't like it one bit. It is not a book you can enjoy. If you have to check it out, go to your local library instead."
4,"DON'T read ""The Importance of Being Bachman"" until AFTER the book!","For a prolific writer like Stephen King, he sure knows how to utterly destroy a book before the first page of the story was read! Like an ignorant fool, I read through the intro part of the book and already knew how this book would end! Yes, it is an excellent read, but no matter how engrossed I was in the book, I already knew the ending... sort of takes away from the story! So if you get this, just go straight to the actual story, you will not be disappointed!"
4,a prophetic journey,"In 1982 Stephen king wrote the running man; a science fiction action adventure set in 2020 or so. The portrait he painted of the future in this novel is remarkably acurate in our world today, 14 years shy of the running man's. King prophecized a number of things including, reality television with cruel overtones, media influence over gov't, the use of airplanes as weapons, and air pollution. This was a thoroughly enjoyable read that was far superior to and much different than the movie."
4,Great,I read this book as it was recommended to me by a friend as it was similar to The Hunger Games. Great read.
5,Love it!,I could not put this book down. I had to know how it was going to end. Another well written book by Stephen King/Richard Bachman. It definitely has the Bachman feel to it. It is not a happily ever after ending but the main character gets his justice in the end!
5,"Quick read, Action Packed Fun!","This book reads amazingly fast. It is very different then the Movie. It took about 2 days reading to finish this book and I will remeber the characters for a long time. This book is not as political as I would like but it still is a good anti-government book.Fun read, very exciting and very nice ending."
4,Worthwhile Read,"This is the weakest of the original four Bachman books (Rage, The Long Walk, Roadwork, and The Running Man), but it is still a good, worthwhile read. The premise: a game show that very few contestants ever win, and the rest pay with their lives. But this time the contestant is very determined to brake what the network has decided is his destiny. In a race for his own survival he finds himself taking things over the edge, and eventually ""taking up his complaint"" with the very president of the telivision company in a very unfriendly way. An action packed story similar in message and theme as The Long Walk, this story will keep you reading until the end. I certainly give it my recomendation."
4,Ray Bradbury already wrote this,"The Running Man is an interesting glance into the development of a wonderful author. Stephen King's style here is, at times, too direct. Towards the end, the protagonist rambles off an elaborate metaphor - with a gun shot wound - that interprets all of the symbols in the book.Clearly inspired by Fahrenheit 451 (Free Vee, a fear of ""police dogs,"" a government disdain for books and more), this novel might earn more stars if Bradbury hadn't told the story with greater maturity.Nevertheless, King contributes his usual vivid writing style and I didn't put the book down until it was finished. If you're looking for a book with this plot, read Fahrenheit first. If you're looking for an introduction to Stephen King at his best, try ""The Stand."" Once you've done both of those, this book will be a light diversion, and not an unpleasant one."
2,This has a higher rating than Roadwork? Really?,"Of the Bachman Books, this is by far the worst story. It boggles the mind that this book has a higher rating than Roadwork (which is great, 5 stars, see my review). The Running Man had promise. It's the story of a dreary future world where those who have no other choice due to poverty, illness, etc. are driven to compete on gameshow for the chance to get out of their terrible situation, but where ultimately no one ever wins. And if you don't win, you die. Even though the basic idea has been done many times before it still has the potential to be a great story. But potential is all it has. I had a hard time finishing this book and by the end I really didn't care what happened to anyone. I just wanted it over. Nothing really captured my attention. I felt the story dragged on. I typically love the Bachman Books, but this one was terrible. If you must read this story, buy a copy of the Bachman Books and get 4 novels. Don't buy this one on it's own."
4,Good book EXCEPT FOR THE SPOILER,"Another well-written book by King. I have one main criticism. DON'T READ the introductory section ""The Importance of Being Bachman"" until you finish the novel. King writes the MOTHER of all spoilers there. And it's not just a vague reference to one of many events in the novel. It's SPECIFIC information about THE ENDING. Why King would have done this is completely baffling, but he clearly was giving no thought to his readers."
4,Fast Paced!!,"Don't start this book if you want to do anything for a couple of hours. It is extremely fast paced and dark. For King, it's a little more future-tech scary than it is mystical, and I liked that about it. Super gory, not to be read before bedtime (what Stephen King book is, unless you like nightmares??)."
4,Did Stephen King have a crystal ball?,"A world where we're hooked on reality TV, caring more about the outcome of a game show than an election. Watching people do wretched things to themselves and others (hello Fear Factor, Wipe Out and Cops), while environmental problems start affecting people. Treating the poor as slightly less than human...did Stephen King have a crystal ball in the 1980s when he wrote The Running Man?Granted, this book is much more extreme, but it's a real wake-up call about what society can become.A good read. Recommended. And nothing like the movie!"
4,"Decent, yet rough.","Not knowing that Nightfreak was going to be part of the US version of Magic and Medicine, I bought the import.As far as the album is concerned, it's nowhere near as produced as the Debut or Magic and Medicine. If it had been, though...A lot of different styles of music, so you don't get bored there. The best songs of the album are(in no order):Grey Harpoon, Venom Cable, Migraine, Precious Eyes, and Lovers Paradise. Grey Harpoon is great now, but if slightly more produced, it would awesome. Some songs however, just don't make it for me.(i.e. I Forgot my Name, and Auntie's OPeration). Overall not too bad. Can't wait for the next album!"
5,Sturdy and Big,High quality cot. Sturdy and stable. There is no squeeking when you lie on it. Nothing wobbles.I ordered the Lux version so it's roomy.Self-inflating mattress takes about 30 minutes to self inflate. Mattress fits inside a sleeve of the cot.The entire unit folds up into a space-saving log-shaped bundle that's light enough for a person to carry.I have two now in my lab for when someone has to stay late to work.
3,a little sway,"Nice quality. I already had a smaller size Slumberjack that I liked, so I thought I would go a little bigger. Plenty of room and comfortable, but it does sway a little along the long axis (head-feet direction). This makes me worry about long term leg stability/support."
2,too big a pain to put together,This thing was absolutely ridiculous to put together. We managed to put the first end in just fine but we did about everything we could think of to get the other end in. (There were no instructions.) By bracing our feet on the frame and pulling the rod we managed to get the third corner in and about 30 minutes later with my mom sitting on the corner and me pulling with all my strength we got the last corner. We're not using this for camping but for another temporary bed while my grandmother recoups. I would have returned this if we were using it outdoors because there is no way I'm taking this thing apart again. It slept well but I wouldn't buy it again.
2,enormous and hard to assemble,"This cot is very ruggedly constructed and so big, it is suited for only the largest tents. It has a useful carrier into which it fits easily. HOWEVER, the cross-struts at each end were impossible to connect to the frame, even with two men trying, and there were no instructions that might have helped us. We gave up after half an hour of wrestling with it and it is now looking for a new owner. Too bad, as it looks like a very solid and comfortable cot."
1,Won't Last,"When I first used this cot it seemed excellent. The frame is very sturdy and the cot was comfortable. If I had written a review at that point I would have given it 5 stars. But the second trip I took the cover burst like a balloon. Really, I could feel it give a little, and by the time I could get off it there was a 4 foot long rip. It was then I started looking closely at the material of the cover - it is some rubberized material with a few threads in it - not a real canvas. And it has zero rip-stop capability. I tried to sew it but it was like trying to sew a balloon - it just doesn't work. The Slumberjack people say they will give me a new cover, but they never seem to have one in stock to send (for 4 months?). Only get this cot if you plan on using it once! My previous cot lasted 8 years."
3,Large enough but wobbly,"I was really looking forward to my new cot for camping. The size was perfect. 2 things though were not so perfect. One, the end braces were too hard for me to attach, I needed help (it was difficult for him too). And two, when it was all set up we found that it wobbled back and forth (head to toe). I sent it back the next day, and recieved a refund quickly from Amazon. I bought the Outfitter XL Cot for a few dollars more, from Cabela's (also a Slumberjack product) and I am very happy with it. Good quality products other than the wobble."
3,Too hard to set up,"I bought this cot and am taking it back b/c I will be camping with just my daughter and I apparently don't have the muscle to attach the head and foot bars. My husband and I together couldn't do it while setting it up in the living room. It was comfortable and large enough for my daugter and myself (she sleeps practically on me), so that would have been great. It was very heavy and awkward to unfold."
4,one of the best,"pros: solid, sturdy, compact, comfortablecons: need some muscle to put it together**, pretty heavyso...i picked up this cot and it's probably one of the best one's i've ever slept on. very comfortable, easy to setup but you need to use some muscle to attach the support bars (but i'm not sure if it's because i need to break in the material.)i couldn't find any information about folding so, here's my review. it folds up to about half of it's size and is about 5-6 inches in depth and width.overall, great product"
4,Nice and big cot,"This cot is great to use with a twin size inflatable air mattress. I used it during a recent Christmas visit to a family get-together, and was glad I had it. It requires a bit of ""muscle"" to set it up, but once it's up, you're ready for a good night's sleep.I recommend this cot for using with an inflatable mattress and where there is plenty of space for a cot."
2,Hard to set up and it stinks!,Very difficult to get the wide bars on their pegs each time and the odor does not go away. After a year it broke. Nebo sports outfitter XXL cot is much better.
1,they made me give it one star,"one star was really being generous to this object de merde, unfortunately one star is the lowest rating I could give, and by the looks of it everyone else feels the same way, apart from the Irish guy, but then who ever listens to the Irish for advice?"
1,Well they are better than they used to be,"They used to be the worst band in town, now they are just the most mediocre band in the county."
1,gobshite,"The Crocketts are a bleeding awful band, I have seen 14 year olds with a better idea of how to make a decent contribution to modern music, and the 14 year olds i'm talking about are Hanson."
1,I am glad others finally share my long held view,"I have seen these shag sacks many times and in many clubs in London, they are the most pathetic effort of a band I have ever witnessed, only really liked by people who have no time to listen to music, and get there judgement in musical taste from the NME."
2,Not what I expected,"I am an electrical engineer and was looking for an insight into INS. From what I had read, I had the impression that this book would be at a level I could understand with relative ease - not the case. I have now purchased an alternative.This is what happens when you only have a limited review capability before purchasing."
3,There's a fundamental error in Chapter 2,"I thought that a time varying matrix diffeq, xdot = A(t)x, had an integrating factor iff the time-varying system matrix A(t) commuted with int(A(s): 0 -> t) for all t. Then the solution isx(t) = exp(int(A(s);0->t)x(0)For the rotation R, Omega clearly does not commute with its integral in this way. Is the closed form solution still valid? I don't know! It's obviously valid for small delta_t = t(k+1) - t(k), since then the relevant matrices are approximately constant."
2,There are fundamental mistakes in the book,"Page 45 equation 2.60 is wrong. I write in latex form for those who read the book carefully.In the book it is given\dot{\bf{R}}_{b2a}(t) = - \Omega \bf{R}_{b2a}(t)which is fine. But then it concludes that\bf{R}_{b2a}(t) = exp(-\int_{t0}^t \Omega dt) \bf{R}_{b2a}(t_0)which is wrong because $\Omega$ is a function of time.This mistake is propagated.I have used the book but I corrected the mistakes.Response to critic of this review (for the benefit of readers): The first thing you learn in linear system theory is thatif\[\dot{\bf x}(t) = A(t) {\bf x}(t)\] then\[{\bf x}(t) \ne e^{A(t)} {\bf x}_0\] unless $A(t)$ is constant,which both the authors and the critic are not paying attention to."
5,Travel Godsend!,These disposable ice packs were a godsend! I had a low back injury and needed to travel for 4 - 6 hours by air and was concerned about pain. The size and ease of use for these was wonderful. TSA did not have any problem with these being carried on - I just had to show them to them at security. They are small enough that I could be discreet about using them. I also used them during my trip as I was out of town for a week. It was great to use at the hotel in the room and at the pool. Excellent price as the local drug store charges $5 for a pack of 2 similar type items. These priced out at $1.67 each including the S&H.
3,fine,Good for when you have no ice handy. Just need to store in a hard case or box so they don't get activated before you need them.
4,My old favorite Springtime in Noisy Village,"This book is wonderful- very real, warm healthy children pictured doing things kids do- enjoying the out of doors and getting into stuff."
3,"ok, not great","While the weights are fine, the velcro is a bit on the short side and it makes it difficult to fasten both weights to one ankle at the same time. Have not had this problem with other weights, so I would have to say the velcro is a bit too short."
2,awkward,I bought these weights to go on my wrists so I could build up strength. I have a hard time wearing them because they fit very awkwardly. They don't adjust tight enough to fit my wrists (I'm a woman) so they eventually slip off. They are kind of long so it makes it difficult to wear them while doing other things. What attracted me to these weights was the adjustable weight (5-10 lbs.) but after you take a weight out of its pocket it is a real pain to get back in.
3,Wish they were more adjustable...,"Not bad, I suppose, but I was hoping to be able to wear them above boots, and their sizing range only barely allows them to fit around an average male ankle, so a low-calf position is right out."
3,like it somewhat,I like that you can change the weight by taking out the weight packets.What I didn't like was it doesn't seem to stay on your ankles well if you want to walk around with it on.If you doing leg lifts it works.
5,Good product,"As always, excellent product which I use all the time. Would definitely consider recommending it to my friends and family."
3,You get what you pay for,"The weights are mediocre, made of nylon and plastic bags filled with sand. I bought them to make part of my work out but now I'm afraid they will fall apart. They are not good for use while moving, jogging, walking because they shift and pull on your ankle."
3,Works Well But Not Enough Weight,"The two 2-1/2 lb ankle weights are good for arms, but too light for ankle weights. I would recommend the two 5 lbs weights instead. Please note that when you buy the 5 lb weight, your buying a set of 2x2.5 lbs weights. These are bulky items and wouldn't recommend them for women. The velcro straps are heavy duty and I don't think they'll fall apart."
3,They're ok...,"I am a larger boned woman (7 inch wrists), and I find that these weights don't fit snuggly on my wrists (or ankles) at all. They do slide around. But, the velcro is secure, so I don't feel like they will come off. If you are a smaller boned person, I would imagine that these weights would be uncomfortable. A small girl will probably find that these will slide right off her hands. My hands are larger, so I would not have that problem. I will keep these, but I think that weighted gloves are a better option."
4,Easily adjustable,"I bought these weights for a couple of reasons. First they are easily adjustable, more adjustable than any other wrist weights I was able to find. If you flatten the soft weights out and put them in on a level surface they go in easier. Second, the velcro strap holds the weights in place pretty well. My wrists are average sized for a woman. On smaller wrists the weights would slip. I have had these weights for about 2 months now and have used them for my aerobics, circuit training and walking routines. I like having my hands free to handle various equipment. I think they are a good buy."
3,Good product,"The product was good and seemed new but there was only one problem. The box that it came it look kind of bent and folded. Anyways, I use this on morning run and it feels good. It's big but it makes you stronger."
2,Misleading Description?,It would seem to me that 5 pound ankle weights means two 5 pound weights which is what I wanted. What they meant is two 2 1/2 pound weights. The quality seems fine but since I already have 2 lb. weights I have little use for them.
1,disappointing,"I got this book because I was exploring whether or not I was going to come back into the church. I was looking for some guidance around the changes that have occurred. The author continuously makes the assumption that the reader has already decided to come back and is enthusiastically ready to begin. This was frustrating to me as I was not in that category. It is also quite judgemental on a lot of levels, making a lot of assumptions about people that are quite disrespectful and not very catholic (excuse the pun). On the whole, while I learned a bit about some of the changes in the church while I've been gone, mostly this book convinced me that coming back would be the wrong choice for me at this time. So, I guess, in some ways, it was helpful after all."
1,Such a disappointment,"This book is so far to the left that it falls off the table. It is short on Catholic Church doctrine and strong on the extreme liberal opinions and even herecy.I would highly recomend ""Surprised by Truth: 11 Converts Give the Biblical and Historical Reasons for Becoming Catholic"" by Patrick Madrid."
5,"An important book, buy it while you can.","Having been written right after the war, by a non-German, this book serves as an important first-hand look at Germany and the dismal quality of life there in the months and year after the war. It also does not hesitate to illustrate how the allies (American, British, and Russian) performed absolutely beastly acts upon the German citizenry. War is war, and nobody escaped WWII with clean hands - they just don't make a lot of movies and documentaries about what the atrocities committed by the allies, because as it is in all wars, the victor gets to write the history books. This is an important book, buy it before it's banned for telling the truth."
1,Revisionist Historical Rubbish,"There are more balanced and nuanced views of this horrific period.....do yourself a favor and avoid this tome to somehow suggest the ""Germans suffered more than most""......and for a war they started. What next? an appeal to give the Volk back their lost Sudetenland homes, and Breslau....memo to humanity....dont start sadistic wars and dont expect to be treated with kindness when the war is lost. This author serves no useful purpose, alas."
2,Mixed bag - some interesting quotes and aspects - some ideological rubbish,"This book is truly a mixed bag. On the one hand it is very frank at exposing several important and serious aspects of the terrible revenge against German civilians during and especially after the war. But at the same time the author mixes some historical facts with ideological statements that are nothing but rubbish. It may be partly related to the style of writing back then (the work was initially published in 1947). But still, this way of exploiting the fate of these civilians for ideological purposes is repugnant and disrespectful. Therefore, I recommend rather reading e.g. ""A terrible revenge"" by Alfred De Zayas, ""After the Reich"" by Giles MacDonogh, or maybe even ""Crimes and mercies"" by James Bacque. These releases are more pragmatic and put down the facts, yet do not abuse history for idiotic ideologies."
3,It is ok!!,It is ok. It is not very big or loud. But my son asked for a tlaking alligator for christmas and this worked out very well.
5,CROCs RULE!,I DIDNT GET THIS CROC BUT GOT A BIGGER ONE & IT HAD ANIMAL PLANET TAGSON IT THAT I CAN REMEMBER & IT MADE REAL CROC SOUNDS! ANYWHO I WILL SAYCROCs IN GENERAL ARE HARDER TO FIND THAN A BEAR OR A DOG & ANY OF THESESTUFFED CROCS ARE MADE AWESUM (IVE SEEN THEM ALL) & ARE BIG FAVORITES ATOUR HOUSE! LUV-EM! THE FAKE STUFFED TEETH ARE PRICELESS!
3,confuse,this is a very twisted book and the author has to have twisted mind to write it. i never knew who i was reading about blain or doc or allen. it was just a little too crazy for me
1,awful 101,"I purchased the beige cover version of the book, and it was so awful to read the chapters kept repeating themselves,misspelled words,words running into each other,synonms,run-on words,different versions of the same chapters,previous chapters that was already read in other chapters,paragraphs that kept repeating the whole page,etc.... try to find the copy of the blue/black book maybe that is better!! I will never buy a book from this author again."
3,A Great Story! Unrevised Edition,"I've just finished reading ""Obsession 101"" (Unrevised Copy). The plot was very well written, I enjoyed it very much! My only qualms with the book, were the lack of character development and tying of loose ends. For example, what became of Her sister and the impending divorce? What became of her other sister and her upcoming birth of tiwns? Etc. What became of Juanita?I agree with the previous posts about the run on sentences and such. At times it was hard to follow due to this, but nevertheless the story was very much well written, those errors aside. I enjoyed the twist at the end, I definitely did not see that coming!I look forward to reading more books from this author!"
4,UrbanWritten Reviews- Obsession 101,"I simply loved this book, Rashawn Ams' character pulled me in. I thought the story was very suspenseful. I was really surprised by the ending, but on and poppin, Michelle McGriff's has great style."
4,Fascination read,"This book, which is a continuation of Michelle McGriff's prior book For Love's Sake, is a fascinating read. It keeps you on edge the entire book and be prepared for many surprises and twists and turns. It has an air of the realistic. I found this book thrilling."
4,Great intensity in the story!,"Michelle McGriff is a natural storyteller. She creates a world full of passion and intensity that draws you in right from the beginning. Her stories are complete, but you will still find yourself asking for more. Obsession 101 gives you a heroine you can believe in. There are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing throughout the book, and you will still be thrown for a loop at the end. Terry Hooper"
4,An underexposed but very talented artist who deserved better.,"Mike James Kirkland is one of R&B's great unknowns. This 1973 release includes the gorgeous ballads ""You Put It On My Mind"" and the title track as well as an interesting remake of Carol King's ""It's Too Late"". Kirkland's vocal style and delivery bear strong resemblances to Martvin Gaye's but he was a fine artist in his own right. Had he been better promoted he just may have become an R&B superstar."
5,Best skacore out there,"This rocks. Its like opivy with horns, and a little more hardcore. If you like opivy, rancid, voodoo glowskulls, big d and the kids table or streetlight manifesto, get this. It will blow you away."
4,Great skacore!,"I'm not a very big skacore fan, but I absolutely love Link 80. This CD stands out from my collection of mostly ska/poppunk. This whole CD is great, The vocals are amazing, Nick had such a great voice, he can go from like hardcorish shouting to sorta soft singing. ""Nowhere Fast"" is probably my favorite song on this CD, but the whole thing is great, buy it! Also get ""Killing Katie"", It's a bit less hardcore, more ska, but anything Link 80 is amazing. RIP Nick."
4,"warm, nice looking boot",I have been wearing these around the house for 2 days to test the comfort and fit. They are very comfortable and cute too! They are a bit stiff out of the box but I have been able to bend and stoop better than I would have thought when I first put them on. They are also surprisingly lightweight for warm winter boots. They are true to my size 9 womens foot. The only negative I can come up with is that the shaft is big and the laces don't help in tightening them up. I do have small legs though and I do not tuck my pants into them either. If you have bigger calves or want to tuck in your jeans or snowpants you'll be fine. My jeans fit over the top just fine. I would wear a long sock to keep them from rubbing my legs.
5,Fantastic!!,"I've had these boots for 2 years now and they are the best footwear purchase I have ever made! I just spent a slushy few days in the NY snow and my feet were warm and dry the whole time, I wear them with thick wool socks and they are totally comfortable"
2,"Nice concept, message, etc but don't like DiMeo Riot so far.","I LOVE every Riot album I've heard that doesn't have Mike DiMeo. Someone please let me know, what's good DiMeo Riot album that is instrumentally comparable to other non-DiMeo Riot albums? Riot albums with G.Speranza, R.Forrester, and T.Moore are FAR superior to anything I've heard so from from the F.DiMeo Riot. Nothing unique about his voice. This album has a few killer lead guitar parts but that's about. I've heard ""Through The Storm"", ""Sons of Society""..... boring. The only Riot albums I have NOT heard are the rest of the F.DiMeo albums and I'm not really sure I want to go there."
3,Student Review,Used it to pass entrance test at Jr. college to get into A&P w/o taking BIO 101. Used chapters 1-25. I passed!
1,DO NOT BUY FROM Abe Books,"I bought this book from Abe Books through Amazon, they said the book was new! I got the book, it was used and the code to gain online access which is part of the book had been removed ( probably from the previous user from this NOT NEW book, so I send them an email and here is what I say how they respond,Me:I bought this through you on Amazon, it said the condition is new, its missing its online registration code for my online class. I am going to make an online review if this is not sorted out ASAP. I need that code right now.Abe Books:Hello,Thank you for contacting AbeBooks Customer Support. I'm sorry to hear that you are having issues with your Amazon order. Unfortunately, we can not assist you with this order as it was not purchases through the Abebooks website. Please contact Amazon directly for further assistance. Thank you for your time.Sincerely,Rosalyn M.AbeBooks Customer Support"
2,unimpressive recording of a great piece,"Bad italian, poor intonation.Really nothing more to say.I haven't heard other recordings of these operas, but the singers on this recording are very sloppy."
1,Caution!! This is not an audio CD!,The rating should really be no stars at all! The CD was not what I had expected.I wish I had seen I J Wylie's comments about this title. It is not the audio CD. Those who see this title should beware as the CD can't be returned to Amazon as you need to remove the plastic wrapping in order to listen to the CDs.
4,A Great Workout,"I just started the SBD five days ago and purchased this dvd to compliment it. I haven't fully tested the dvd, but Phase 1 exercise is great. It was only 15 minutes but boy I definately felt it in my body especially the core region. I'm thinking this is really going to help me transform my body in the long run."
2,Not if you have arthritis,"I rented this from the library before purchasing it to see if it was for me. I only have about 25 pounds to lose and have arthritis, especially in my knees. I understand the concept of interval training and for this purpose, it is really good. I was annoyed though, that the person on the back right, Lisa, was suppose to be the ""modifier"" for those who are not able to do the workout so easily at first. Most DVD's (like Leslie Sansone), the modifier person, really does tone the moves down. I found that throughout the dvd, she did the work out at full-tilt, almost more intense than the instructor/lead. At one point, they had these side lunges with the knees and she was doing them full spread and deep (impossible for me). The only thing modified was that she did not move her arms. The arms for most people are not the problem! I think I will stick with my Leslie Sansone dvd's and save my money."
3,Excellent Workout,The South Beach Super Changed Workout is excellent especially when coupled with the South Beach Diet! You only get out of it what you put in it!
5,Tough workout but EASY for beginners to build up to!,"I could not be more impressed with this video. It starts with the simplest moves, and works its way up to difficult ones. No matter what level you are, you WILL get a tough workout and break a major sweat! The instructor is very cool, not annoying in any way. Easy to follow. Easy to maintain and keep up with it because it's not an hour long."
3,alright but....,"The workout is alright. I did get a sweat going after 6 minutes of the first 20 minute segment. What I did realize while doing it was you could get the same type of workout by reading a workout magazine's excerpt. It wasn't unique.The good thing was that my kids found it easy to do with me so if you are looking for a workout to do along side a 3 year old and a 1 year old, this one might work for you for the first 20 minute segment."
5,The South Beach Diet Workout,I am loving the workout -- it is a total workout but as strenuous as you want it to be. The 15 minutes increments are great too.
5,"Pulling back, changing slightly","The band pulls back from their epic sound on the last album, and strip the soundback a little. Much less intensity, much easier to lisetn to. These songs are still brilliant; the lyric focus has changed from cosmic to much more personal. After doing his solo career, Hammil no doubt shifted to the much more personal themes of his solo albums. Sleepwalkers is one of the best tracks the band ever did. Not a huge change in sound, but enough of a change to be interesting. The band always had a very focused, very individual song, but they found lots of interesting ways to change it up."
4,"Excellent, But No Pawn Hearts or H to He","An excellent album, but I simply don't find it as memorable as Pawn Hearts or H to He. Even with two bonus tracks, it feels short, and neither Sleepwalkers nor The Undercover Man really seemed to grab my attention. Scorched Earth is easily the best track, with Arrow coming in second.Nothing on the album is bad per se (though parts of A Louse if Not a Home grate on my ears after a while) but it simply doesn't quite measure up to earlier VDGG masterpeices"
2,Greatness glitch,"2 1/2For every intriguing compositional step forward, there is a pompously bloated one back."
3,Fun gift idea for the true texan or wanna be texan!,Catchy cover and fun as a christmas gift for a texas family or friend. One that will get a chuckle.
1,"""It doesn't work""","In my case, it was a total waste of money....""It doesn't work"" After numerous calls to Command support and sending unit back for bench chk, problem was not rectified with no solution from manufacture...It will not auto switch to fax when online, which is the main reason for purchase.""Doesn't work as advertised"" It went into the garbage."
1,check return policy and refund befor purchase,"I order New and I got used with no plastick rap I trayed one see if it will work but unfortunatly did not so I trayed to contac the seller wit no luck , until I contact Amazon and then tehy answer back. I dont know if Ishould use Amazon again"
5,fax switch,"Once I figured out how to get the unit to work..trial & error, despite handbook, it was a breeze.Unfortunately the support tel# & the iternet address is no longer in service. I'm not sure of the company."
2,Not So Commanding,"Biggest issue is that while we're talking on the phone and another call comes in, the device interrupts the ongoing call with an overly loud busy signal. The call isn't ended but it's very difficult to continue a conversation. Also had a problem answering calls from phones not directly connected to the device. The device did not detect that the phone had been answered and routed the call to the answering machine."
4,A beautiful book,I was drawn to the illustrations of this book and was delighted when I discovered a story told in the form of a traditional folk tale. The story speaks to the perserverance that is sometimes takes to truly find the answers that you seek. Beautifully told and illustrated.
3,Alfie may not be for me.,"This album is okay. I don't want to sway anyone away from it. I suppose that I may not be a fan of the band, but they are not terrible. Make your own jugement. I would not recommend it to anyone."
4,One Fine Day is one fine movie!,"One Fine Day is a sweet romantic comedy starring George Clooney (Syriana) and Michelle Pfeiffer (I Am Sam), and directed by Michael Hoffman (A Midsummer Night's Dream).The movie takes place in one very outrageous day in New York City, hence the title, as newspaper columnist Jack Taylor, played by Clooney, and architect Melanie Parker, played by Pfeiffer, miss their kids' field trip at school, blame each other, exchange kids so that they can each follow up on their day's work, and end up falling in love.One Fine Day is one fine movie. It's charming, funny, and it can be enjoyed by men and women alike.RecommendedB+"
3,No HOOK. Zzzzzzzz,"My wife and I really wanted to like this movie. We've enjoyed many movies of this style and like both of the stars but we were only able to gut it out for 30 minutes and then bailed. I can count on one hand the number of times that we've done that in the last 40 years. I think it deserved 2.5 stars but since we only watched 30 minutes I rounded up. Why didn't it work? All the humor seemed predictable, overly contrived and annouying. But, I hope Clooney tries this type of story again because he's proven he can do more than just action movies."
4,Well Done.,"Simple story, same old ending... butCloony and Pfeifer matches good, Scenes are brief and proper.Frankly, I liked songs better than the movie."
3,A BIT BORING............,"WHEN THIS FILM FINISHED,I WAS LEFT WONDERING WHAT HAD ACTUALLY HAPPENED,I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION - NOT MUCH.THAT SAID IT IS ENJOYABLE TO WATCH IF YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF HOURS TO SPARE.THE SETTING IS NEW YORK, MICHELLE PFEIFFER AND GEORGE CLOONEY WHO ARE BOTH PARENTS,GET STUCK WITH THIER KIDS FOR THE DAY.SINCE THEY HAVE TO WORK,THEY BOTH DEPEND ON EACH OTHER TO TAKE IT IN TURN TO LOOK AFTER EACH OTHERS CHILDREN.NICE FILM,FAMILY FILM,AND A DISSAPOINTING ENDING."
1,Stereotypes from beginning to end!,"George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer star as one dimensional characters that are living stereotypes of all that is wrong with the opposite sex. Each character constantly makes assumtions about the other character based on stereotypes and neither are dissapointed. If I ever stepped in a puddle as shallow as either of these two characters I won't even get dew on my shoes! Don't get me wrong, with the premise it could have been a cute love story, but the writer must of been paid per word and not for quality. Even though I sometimes enjoy mediocre romatic stories, this was painful to watch and I pitty the actors for being in a movie with such transparent characters."
1,Absolutely awful movie,"I absolutely hated this movie by the time it finished.I think it is those awful kids that need to be told exactly howthings stand in the real world, instead of being told time andtime again ""Its not your fault."" And the poor kitten.By the time the movie ended I would have thought with all thatrunning round, its poor little brain would have been scrambledor it definately would have thrown up all over that awfulchilds chest. I hope people DO NOT take this as an exampleof how to look after a live animal...I know where I will be putting this movie!!"
4,Surprisingly Good....and this from a film snob.,"I must admit that I enjoyed this movie far more than I expected to. I gave it a shot because it is a (female) friend of mine's favorite movie and I have come to seriously enjoy Clooney's movies, and as far as romantic comedies go this is one of the best I've seen in recent years. There are certain parts that seem silly and forced (like the Clooney subplot mentioned in the amazon.com review), but Clooney and Pfeiffer pull off their characters with enough charm and realism that any problems you may have with the logic of the story can be forgiven. If you and your girlfriend/wife are looking for something you will both enjoy then this movie will fit the bill."
5,Kids are the best matchmakers,Clooney and Pfieffer have great chemistry and energy in this romantic comedy of single parents who find love the second time around. It's like a potential step-siblings version of The Parent Trap when the little boy and girl scheme to get their respective parent a date. A positive message on how second chances can happen if you have the eyes and optimism of a child.
5,A romantic film...,"A wonderful film with two wonderful actors starring in it, Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney. These two caracters build a relationship after a hard beginning. Lots of fun and romance."
4,"Dreamy, almost too perfect, but funny and entertaining.","I enjoyed this movie. Characters were believable but almost too much so. Two very attractive actors mix well. Ended up really pulling for them to get together and they did. For Michelle fans, like myself, very nice. She is real people, even in her undies, if you know what I mean! Recommended to lovers of all ages."
3,One Fine Day...One Forgettable Movie,"Decent film for romance buffs, ONE FINE DAY delivers on the leads of George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman and Catwoman?). Not much here except the character of Michelle Pfeiffer's son Sammy Parker (Alex D. Linz) seemed to be at the brunt of all the mishaps during the course of the film and to this reveiwer,ruined the whole film for me. If the creator's had toned down the kid's bratty behavior, it would have been a more enjoyable film experience."
2,meh.,"I watched this, and it was just okay; I didn't fall in love with it, but I also didn't want my two hours back. They do an adequate job. Biggest criticism? this continues the trope of they hate each other....so they must secretly want each other. Having tried to dissuade men who took my utter contempt for my not being able to recognise my true feelings (usually utter loathing), I would like to see this romantic convention fall by the wayside."
4,Breezy plotline. Good acting,"George Clooney is not so much an actor as a personality but it's a winning personality and one that you know Michelle Pfeiffer will fall for by the end of the movie. Getting there is a fun little rollercoaster ride as both characters must deal with their conflicting schedules, jobs and children throughout one of the busiest days of their life.This movie is mostly a love story between the director and New York City, especially the breathless lifestyle (kind of hard to believe that either character will have any time for each other AFTER the movie is over, but who cares?)Sweet, unpretentious fun. This movie makes a nice gift and something that you can watch when you are feeling bored or depressed."
2,BLU-RAY ONLY REVIEW!,"I purchased a blu-ray upgrade of this movie (not from Amazon, past the return deadline unfortunately.) I could only play it on one of my two players. A friend tried it, and it would not play on either of her players! Since it did play on one player out of four, I suspect it is not just a problem with the individual disk. Hence this heads up review. It was pretty grainy also, even allowing for the gray day they were having."
5,The melding of geography and history,"This book is so unique,I don't know how to describe it.Great stories,great pictures,great maps,like only the Brits can do it.We modern Americans have no idea how much smuggling was a part of our heritage in this country and the history of England.This book brings it all home.It's just so sad it is so rare and hard to find.It should be re-issued.Smuggling was the 17th,18th and 19th century version of fudging on those nice people at the IRS-or in the case of the UK-the sweethearts at Inland Revenue."
5,Very pleased,"I bought this set when it was a gold box deal for $49.99. Even though the description was a little confusing, I took the risk, and now I'm so glad I did. I thought I might clarify some things to dispel any lingering apprehension others may have. First, the set contains 53 pieces: 8 salad forks, dinner forks, dinner knives, and dinner spoons; 16 teaspoons (really helpful if you eat cereal, ice cream, or yogurt on a daily basis!); 1 sugar spoon; 1 butter knife; 2 serving spoons (1 slotted, 1 not); and a serving fork. Also, the description mentions a ""pinstripe"" that isn't really apparent in the pictures. In person, the majority of the piece is shiny, but the handle has 3 stripes of the brushed nickel effect--very classy looking. Lastly, if, like me, you're ignorant about stainless, 18/10 means that each piece is 18% chrome (for maximum corrosion resistance) and 10% nickel (for a silver-like lustre)."
3,Six Pieces Were Not Up To Quality,Just got a set and had to send back six pieces. Two of the knives had small rust spots on the handle. The chrome on a teaspoon was messed up. Four of the Salad Forks were damaged with small drill scratches or imperfections.I'm totally not picky but they were too messed up to keep. Had to call Oneida and spend another $5.00 and a trip to the post office to mail them the damaged pieces. Hopefully I'll get replacements sometime soon.Great deal... but the quality isn't very good.
4,great deal,Very happy with the quality of this set. I really like the striped pattern and the weight of each piece.
5,"Great product, well worth the money.","This silverware set is great. All of the pieces came and were in great condition, very sturdy. You can even scoop hard ice cream without fear of bending the spoon. The photo really doesn't show the pinstripe design, but it looks very elegant. Overall, it's a beautiful set that's a steal at the price."
5,Excellent value!,An extremely good value set (particularly if you get it on discount for about $30-$40). Each piece feels heavy and the design is very smart. An excellent buy!
3,HAMISH HAS BEEN BETTER!!!!!!,"Tommy Jarret, a drug addict is found dead. The police say it was an overdose. Hamish does not think so. He sets out to prove it. Then for most of the book, this murder is not even thought about. Hamish gets involved with drug dealers and gets to act the part of a drug lord. His supposed to be wife is another detective, of course they end up in bed together. Hamish even wanders into a shop and a girl they takes him home with her and they end up in bed. Wish Beaton would write like she did in the earlier books. She used to me able to make me see the villege, the countryside and the people in my mind. But, not any more. The book does have a surprise ending which is fairly good. Hope the writing gets back like it was."
3,Disappointing,"I may be giving up MC Beaton after her last two books, Death of an Addict and The Wizard of Evesham. After reading The Wizard of Evesham, I had great hopes that my beloved Hamish series would not take the same nose dive but alas it did. I still love the characters and the setting but the plot?! Obviously the reason for the murder was to have Hamish and company have the adventure in Amsterdam, but Ms. Beaton simply dropped the ball on a satisfying ending. Let's hope she gets out of her slump with both the MacBeth and Raisin series to once again delight her fans."
4,Hammish Macbeth,I first enjoyed the series that played on BBCAmerica and wanted to see how it compared to the novels in which it was based. I was pleasently surprised. The series doesn't follow the novels exactly but there are elements fans can recognize. This one in particular can be seen adapted into the television production. I liked comparing the two.
3,Typical but Fun,Has all the ususal features of this series which comforting to Haimish Macbeth lovers even though the plot is weaker than some..
4,"Strange ending, but still fantastic","Always a fan of the Hamish Macbeth series. This one had a strange, muddled ending, with a side story romance. Strange. Not bad, but not as compelling, plot-wise, as some of the others.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."
2,Where were Lugs and Sonsie?,"I'm not reading the Hamish Macbeth series in order, but, I did read 'Death of a Scriptwriter' before this one. It's been returned to the library so I can't check, but, I believe Lugs and Sonsie, Hamish's dog and cat, are written about in the book. If I am wrong, please, correct me. I read 'Death of an Addict' wondering the whole time where Hamish's pets were. That took away from my enjoyment of this series. This one was off to me in other ways, too. Hamish looking for a wife and willing to settle for the cold police woman or even the Dutch girl? He barely knows either of them. The book just touched on characters, the girl renting the chalet, or plotlines, the religious cult and the husband and wife running it.I see this one was written in 1999 so I won't worry the author became like Lilian Jackson Braun and 'The Cat Who..."" series and just phoned it in or had it ghostwritten to terrible results later in that series."
3,Just OK,"This was a disappointing title for M.C. Beaton, an author I usually love. Hamish acted uncharacteristically, and there was no sign of Priscilla. At least a 'walk-on' would have been nice. I am such a Beaton fan and never thought I'd come across one that I'd give away. But this one is not a keeper."
2,Not of High Quality,"This is the second Hamish McBeth book I have read, and it is a disappointment. It lacks the folksy charm of the first. The plotting is weak, and the situations absurd. I suppost if you want a simple, easy weekend read this would do. If I had a cottage, that is where I would put this lightweight piece of nonesense."
2,Very disappointing effort!,"Having read all of the Hamish McBeth series, I was eagerly looking forward to the latest installment. I have deep suspicions it was written by someone other than M. C. Beaton, as the charm of Scottish village life was almost completely absent from the book. The way I picture Hamish, I could never mistake him for the head of an international drug cartel even disguised in an Armani suit. Ms. Beaton's work started to change, for me, a couple of books ago when she killed off Towser, Hamish's dog. He was an imaginary dog - he could have lived forever. She needs to return to the formula that got her here. As they always told us in English class, write based on what you know."
3,drug addict,"Actually I did not enjoy this book as much as the rest of the Hamis MacBeth I have read. It seemed out of his baliwick to go undercover as a drug dealer, adopt foul language, get tricked into going with a prostitute, no matter how young and seemingly innocent she was, and hang with the really rotten underground type. None of those things are the Hamish MacBeth I have become accustomed to. But then I have never enjoyed books or movies involving drug use.I like the kindly but firm, look the other way when it isn't harmful, PC MacBeth, who loves the people under his watch, and does everything he can to help them all. I wish he was real."
3,Only Okay,"Although Hamish is brighter than he appears, the idea of him posing as a drug kingpin just doesn't work. And the dialogue is weak in the extreme. It is extremely rare when a television series is better than the books but the BBC series of Hamish Macbeth is. This is a very light series anyway, but this story was one of the weakest."
1,I didn't really like this toothbrush. I usually ...,"I didn't really like this toothbrush. I usually get a medium toothbrush in my usual brand, but medium was much too harsh in the Oral-B. I also thought the angle made it awkward to use. I wouldn't recommend this toothbrush in medium, but maybe the soft bristles would be better."
3,"I was pleased with this toothbrush. However, I ...","I was pleased with this toothbrush. However, I was just as happy with my old one. I usually buy Oral-B toothbrushes, but not any one particular kind. I'd buy this if it happened to be on sale."
5,I enjoyed using my Oral-B toothbrush very much. ...,"I enjoyed using my Oral-B toothbrush very much. It was a bit firmer than I usually buy, but I really liked the way the head had sort of a pointed end that I could use to get behind my back teeth, and even under my bridges (now I'm showing my age!). I'd recommend this to anyone."
3,Just What I Expected,"I bought this necklace just to have a cheap necklace to wear everyday. The color was darker than expected, but the length was great. Unfortunately, two of the pearls fell off after a few weeks of wear. I glued them back in place, though, and they have stayed on since."
4,Cross Pendant,"The pendant was nice, color online looked more turquoise but it was a darker blue. Still nice pendant for a good price."
1,Save your money if you're studying for the MCSE,"With much preparation and study, I passed NT server and Enterprise with Minasi supplemented Sybex. While they aren't perfect, they will prepare you for the test. I doubt if this book will. It reads like a college text requiring instructor amplification. I could live with the monotonous writing style but soon tired of correcting errors (I couldn't find an errata on the net). For me, the content was inconsistent. At times like a quick review to get everybody on the same page and elsewhere very, very terse. Example, subnetting gets 10 pages here (and not covered very well). The Cram (a summary!) gives it 16 and does a fair job. This book has only 376 pages while the Cram has 426!! No answers to chapter questions. Too much detail in places and none where we'll be tested. Take your wife to dinner with the money you save, she's tired of your studying all the time anyway."
1,MCSE Guide to TCP/IP on MS Windows NT 4.0 w/CD-ROM,"A ""Terrible"" book. I've been reading tech books for years and have never seen anything like it. How Microsoft endorsed this book is beyond me! It tells you how to use NT Help, the desktop, and Find Files (absolute filler - no relevance), but little if any description on ""Subnetting"" (and everything else). How embarrassing. Save your time and don't get tennis elbow from launching it across the room."
1,Tough first book..,"I was forced to buy this book for a class. As a newbie to TCP/IP networks it seemed a little sparse and did not really teach me to much about TCP/IP networking. I was very disapointed in the fact that after this class, I was still no farther along in my understanding of subneting. Thankfully the price of hardware bottomed out, and I was able to get a copy of Win NT to practice with, or I might not know how to subnet to this day. It would be an ""OK"" book for someone just starting out, if they could get it at a reasonable price. This book would not get you through the testing that is going on these days."
5,Favortie Jersey!,GT is my Alma Mater. Had to have it. Perfect fit. Really like to color scheme and graphic design. Would like to see to have one with an angry Buzz on the back.
5,"Cakes,Chickens,and Culprits Galore!!","Love Among the Walnuts is an enchanting read which teaches you the importance of family, respecting differences,and how to save your comatose parents and pet chicken from being further harmed by your greedy, criminal uncles. Take all of this, spin them up and add a hint of eccentricity and you get Love Among the Walnuts. 2 Thumbs UP!!!"
5,The Best Book I Have Read EVER,This book was amazing. I found it very hard to put down and consumed every word in one day. I have read some really good books but this was the best. It was so fun. Each sentence brought another suprise. How each character found something they loved more than life itself. And it was so easy to read. It is a book I will read again and force it all my friends.
1,cheap and bad toy,It was broken in 5 minutes after open the package. It is very cheaply made. It is not money's worth.
4,Hours of fun,"Very well received Christmas gift for a 5 yr old boy. Spent a good hour in the yard playing with it with his 6 yr old female friend. Both had a blast. We had to get it off the roof a few times. Flies well, just stand back because it hit someone in the face. Thought it might break with the enthusiasm, but it's still going strong. Helped the kids get out some energy and spend some good time outside."
1,poor quality,"1 of my son's 4th birthday gifts. This is built with cheap foam pieces... 4, and a plastic blade. It flies well, and it is easy to use. Unfortunately, it lasted a sum total of 10 flights before it was reduced to its 5 component parts. No durability whatsoever. I was able to use scotch tape to reassemble it, and it still works; but, it is total and utter junk. It's comparable to a cheap balsa wood propeller plane sold in a tourist junk toy shop."
5,Teaching Mrs.Tingle!-The Best!,"I saw teaching Mrs.Tingle with my friend and I expected it to be kinda scary but when I saw it, it was SOOOO FUNNY! It was one of the best movies I have ever seen! Sure, unexpected things happen during the movie, but nothing to scary. Trust me it's a comedy! Go and see it!"
2,Spoke too soon,I wrote my review after I rec'd my unopened DVD movie. I noticed the problem when I opened the DVD. The circle holder the DVD sits on was broken so basically the DVD was bouncing around inside it's unopened box. It's a minor defect but I wish it was not broken. I played the movie and that was ok. So I guess that's all.
3,OK But Not Stellar,"This movie is almost completely forgettable; it's also almost completely predictable. The SUPER EVIL Mrs. Tingle is a bit amusing, but not really worth the price of admission. Good acting (I should say overacting) by some cast members keep it from being a D, but you should feel free to miss it."
2,Helen Mirren Teaches Acting,"This isn't a dreadful film, merely insipid. The plot is deeply flawed and implausible. It tries to be a number of genres and fails at each. It fails as a comedy, as a suspense thriller and as a horror movie. It almost succeeds as science fiction. The direction is uninspired and Katie Holmes, cute cherub face that she is, should be modeling teen clothing, not acting. The only thing that keeps this movie from being a 1 out of 10 is Helen Mirren. Her performance is fabulously nefarious and is (almost) worth suffering through the rest of it. Her ability to transmute from imperious to faux sympathetic to deviously manipulate and control her prey shows masterful range. Other than Marissa Coughlin's delightful Exorcist rendition, Mirren is the only reason to see this movie. A solid 3/10."
4,Entertaining and you gotta love Helen Mirren!,"I see that there are quite a few negative reviews on this film referencing the acting and plot. I really don't understand how in depth the plot has to be in order t be entertaining. Mrs. Tingle is an hateful woman that is jealous of students that may have a future away from the small town. She didn't get out of the town and she doesn't want anyone else to. All of the students fear her and most of the faculty steer clear of her whenever they can. I just love the segments with Mrs. Mirren. Unfortunately, I hadn't really heard of her prior to this film, but her acting abilities on this film intrigued me so that I had to check out her other films. She is sensational.While the other actors in the film are great, it is certainly Mrs. Mirren that steals the show. I bought the dvd and while it is not a movie that I pull out too often, whenever i do watch it I am always entertained and looking forward to seeing Ms. Tingle in action. Definitely worth checking out."
5,Teaching Mrs. Tingle,"I am very satisfied with this purchase. It came in very quickly, and very high quality.I am always very happy with all Amazon purchases!"
4,Mrs. Tingle,"It was suppose to be called Killing Mrs. Tingle, but this title sounds way better and more fun. I always thought it was a horror movie, but when i finally watched it, i saw it was a comedy as well. It's a good film. Helen Mirren plays a evil teacher really well and Marisa Coughlan was my fav. student of the main three. A crossbow is the only weapon in the movie and i like all the dialouge. It has some funny moments and some good suspense."
3,very good at being bad,Helen Mirren does her job very well here:I found myself wishing she were dead several times.Sometimes the people who should be looking out for you are are actually looking to do you in for their own little bitter reasons?It is a good teen movie of a situationthat gets out of control.
1,"Stupid, stupid, stupid","To people who have said that the only reason this movie got trashed by critics is because they are adults and don't understand teens I have to disagree. First off, I am teen and I thought this movie was incredibly stupid, unfunny, and annoying. It had a ridiculous plot--give me a break they had to tie up the teacher otherwise Katie Holmes wouldn't go to college. Not to mention it was ridiculous that the kids were such clay in Tingle's hands ands would do anything Tingle wanted even though she was tied up. Tingle only had to talk for a few minutes about BS and the kids would get all depressed and do stupid things even if it would totally hurt their friends. I could forgive all this for the movie if it was funny, but it wasn't. Also the redhead was a very annoying, stupid, and feeble-willed character. The only upside to the movie: Katie Holmes is hot."
1,NOT GOOD,"First of all, how in the world can anyone call this a comedy? It shows some lady that gets pleasure out of making honest students' lives a living hell.Three kids cheat and she turns them into the office. They don't know what to do, so they just raid her house, shoot her with a dart, and hold her captive at her own home. Really bad. I don't want to write anything more about this."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A braindead movie that doesn't bother making its imbecilic plot even slightly plausible (how does Mrs. Tingle go to the bathroom?), Teaching Mrs. Tingle should be thanked for virtually ending the career of Kevin Williamson and never mentioned otherwise"
3,Pretty Good Teen Flick,"Any fan of Kevin Williamson or Katie Holmes will like this one. The movie is about a smart teen, Leann(Katie Holmes), who desperately needs to get a scholarship because her mom is a waitress and can't afford to pay for college. Later on,when Leann's strict history teacher, Mrs.Tingle(Helen Mirren), accuses Leann of cheating on a test, Leann and her friends hold Mrs.Tingle captive in her own house. This movie is a good source of light entertainment, but it is very predictable. It's ok to see once or twice."
1,1 star for Katie,"What category does this movie fit in to, other than a stupid teenage chick flick? It might be a horror movie but it was anything but scary. It could be a comedy but it was not at all funny. So we can conclude that the only category that this un-realistic film fits into is ""flop"". The only good part of this movie was Katie Holmes. She was way too good for the movie."
4,Oh this is a great funny movie! Katie was fabulous!,"Oh my goodness! I didn't expect this to be as good as it was. Mrs. Tingle was fabulous, cruel, scared the hell out of me. Katie was incredible as always, making you believe she was the character and she made you feel for her. Her best friend was HILARIOUS, gotta love her, she made me laugh so hard and the guy was GORGEOUS and he and Katie performed one of the sexiest love scenes I may have ever seen. I loved this. Made me laugh like crazy. Everyone in it was fabulous. So many famous actors, I couldn't believe how many people I recognized. See it!"
1,Dumb. Boring. Waste of your 90 minutes,"I rented this film thinking it would be a slick action/suspense. However, the only suspense was guessing how much was left. Having only about 2 ""action"" scenes, 'Teaching Mrs. Tingle' is a dumb, OK-the-first-time-around movie that leaves the viewer priasing the LORD for the end. The first ""action"" scene runs only about 2 minutes. The second, about 4 minutes. A lot of cheesy scenes and corny lines make 'T.M.T.' a boring and nonentertaining film. I recommend it 2 no one."
2,Disapointing,"Like many who were expecting something full of plot and suspence, I rented this video from the store thinking that it would be a good movie. It had to be one of the disapointing movies I've seen. A very unconvincing, shallow plot. Very unbelievable. I mean would things really get to that extreme in such a situation? The strict, mean teacher was portrayed well in the movie, but the drastic degree the students took to get what they wanted. They break into her house and nearly kill her with an arrow. Oh yeah they're really going to college now. I kept waiting and waiting for this movie to end, it seemed that it kept going and going but when it was done, I felt that was the biggest waste of time I ever spent. Don't make the same mistake."
1,The worst movie I've seen this year,"Rubbish, total rubbish is what this movie is. At first it reminded me of 'Jawbreaker', however Jawbreaker is a much better movie. 'Teaching Mrs Tingle' has so many flaws it's embarrassing. Why Helen Mirren would want to do a movie like this when she is well known for only doing quality productions is beyond me. What a way to spoil your career."
3,GRADE: C+,"Helen Mirren is a remarkable actress and it is to her credit that TEACHING MRS. TINGLE works at all. Writer/director Kevin Williamson, fresh off his DAWSON CREEK and SCREAM successes, decided to try something a little different than another teen slasher movie. However, the movie's lack of focus: is it supposed to be funny? scary?, only hurts the overall effect. Katie Holmes shows promise in her role as the nice girl mistakenly accused of stealing a history exam, and Barry Watson (BOGEYMAN) is charmingly handsome as the hunk she and her best friend desire. But it is Mirren's deliciously evil turn as the teacher from hell that holds the film together. The ending is unsatisfying in its abruptness; maybe Williamson should stick with more ""horrifying"" films."
3,Worth watching when there is nothing else to watch.,"It really isn't as bad as most teachers and preachers made it out to be. However, if it was not for Helen Mirren this movie would be worthless. I was surprised that she acceted a role like this, but she did a fantastic job as Mrs. Tingle. All in all--nothing to get shook up about. But watch Helen Mirren portray Mrs. Tingle that part is fantastic."
2,"ABSURD, BUT SOME TIMES IS FUNNY !","The MRs. HIngle from the tittle is totally ansurd; there isn't a teacher like that. But Mirren plays it with conciction, and the result is a good comedy, with dierctor Kevin WIlliamson not dropping one once of blood. It's good to watch eating popcorn, nothing more. About the teen actors, the one who plays Holmes'friend is the best!"
3,Dissappointing Overall,"I expected this movie to be much better, considering it came from the masermind behind ""Scream"", ""I know what you did last summer, and ""The Faculty"". It was a good movie and funny too, but I expected more. There were no real surprises in the plot, and Williamson borrowed heavily from the book, ""Killing Mr. Griffin"" by Louis Duncan(the film's original title was Killing Mrs. Tingle). The movie was very enjoyable overall, however, and had some great performances, especially by Marisa Coughlan, who did a terrific impression of Linda Blair from ""The Exorcist"".... It was an ok time passer, but could have been better. I think the film could have worked better as a thriller..."
5,Oh My GOD!,"This was the most amazing movie I have seen in a long time. It was funny, it was scary, it had everything. The suspense was great, and it kept you guessing until the end. I was a little annoyed at what happened to Trudy. She almost got what she deserved. This is definately on my to buy list. I can't wait for it to come out on video."
2,Teaching Mrs. Tingle,"I did not like this movie much at all. It was not boring, it was just so stupid. The one good thing about the movie is that Mrs. Tingle represents every teacher that you despised, and on that level I liked this movie. On every other level the film failed miserabley."
2,What?,"What were they thinking for the end of this movie, One of my best friends said the movie was supposed to be even blacker comedy, but those stupid kids in colorado went and killed a bunch of people and then got the Cinema blamed so they changed it a bit and to me makes no sense at the end."
2,Very Disappointing!,"I had waited so long for this movie to come out, and then when it did, it completely failed to live up to my expectations. I suppose the acting wasn't too bad; I was mostly diasppointed by the boring plot and sophomoric vocabulary used. Did they intend on making the characters as boring and juvenile as possible, because they certainly did. I would not want to see this movie again."
1,This is not a hilarious comedy,"I rented this DVD because the cover said it was a ""hilarious comedy."" If you just look at the concept of the movie (i.e., unfair teacher gets tied up while her bungling students try to get her to listen to them), then I suppose it's funny. However, there was very little about this movie that was funny. It should have been labeled a thriller. Helen Mirren, as Mrs. Tingle, is just as frightening as any masked ax murderer, and she does on several occasions try to kill one of the teenagers. My children and I were very disappointed--not in the acting ability of the actors (they did a fine job), but in the film being represented as something that it wasn't. It is not a comedy by any stretch of the imagination. Huge disappointment!!"
5,Such descriptive words!,"So many things make this a fantastic book. The author's choice of words --risky, bloodthirsty, shaking with fear, hesitantly -- is perfect for my children's expanding vocabulary. Also wonderful is her reference to ""The Three Billy Goats Gruff"" as a source of inspiration for Joe. Joe and the monster both love reading. Joe uses exclamation points in his letters because he wants his words to be shouted. The pictures are expressive and colorful too.My two year old son loves this book. He hated to return it to the library! We finally bought him his own copy."
5,Great book to help with nighttime terrors,"Both of my daughters and I loved this book. What a wonderful, original way of dealing with the problem of monsters under the bed. As a parent, I too tried giving my children ""monster spray"" to get rid of monsters but just like the boy in this book, my children felt that since I first said there was no such thing as monster and then gave them spray to get rid of the monsters - how could they be sure the spray would actually work.The idea of the letters was excellent and I loved when the monster accuses the little boy of being mean because he ate monster cookies - well every letter was just hilarous and the end was great too.I highly recommend this book."
4,No Ordinary Film,"A killer bisexual, a corpulent gay thief, a pregnant rocker whose weakness is gay and bisexual men, a Vietnamese-American teen who fancies dresses and a Latino teen coming to grips with his homosexuality are just some of the players in this whimsical, ""Melrose Place""-like soaper/spoof. Underneath the placid faade of twentysomething Kevin's rambling L.A. house, sexual confusion reigns supreme among his unusually [amorous] group of boarders. Newly single, Kevin finds solace (and a bit more) in the (...) embraces of several of his roommates. Adding to Kevin's confusion is the revelation that roomie Wendy is pregnant and the father is his ex."
2,DVD cover a bit deceiving,"This was certainly not the greatest movie, but despite my feelings on it, I did want to just point out that I found the fact that these three guys on the cover do NOT appear in the film at all to be a bit strange....anyone else think this was weird?"
2,Too Many subplots,"This is one of the lousiest acted gay films I've seen in a long time. It's so bad, the DVD comes with an optional ""humorous commentary"" track that plays with the movie. The acting seems stiff. It's deffinately a movie to laugh at, not with... It's only saving grace is the love story between Vince and Ramone. Although the acting is no different than the rest of the story, there are some moments that are pretty cool..."
1,Bad Copy of Shallow Grave,"There's a wonderful little Scottish movie called Shallow Grave floating around (on DVD even, and it's quite fascinating); this movie is Shallow Grave gone bad. The plot's very much the same, but the acting here -- if you can call it acting -- is infinitely worse, and too many of the characters are not very interesting and simply unlikable. There's also nothing memorable about the filmmaking itself -- it's very inconsistent, a hodgepodge of styles that never come together in a true directorial vision. In fact, sometimes it seems all director/screenwriter Witkins is interested in are his actors pretty bodies."
1,waste of money and time,"In short...I couldn't find a single aspect of this movie that would be worth even ""1 star""... should I have the rating ""minus 5"" for sure it would apply. The plot is completely senseless and the actors (my God) should do anything else but perform. If anyone feels like buyng this movie please let me know it... I will be very glad to get rid of it."
1,the acting is the only thing that was stiff,"this movie sounded like a cool idea. apparently the idea was cool, but what came out of it wasn't. the acting is bad, the characters are stiff. you don't get enough to know the characters. andy is cute and has a nice body, but the plot sucked!"
2,"Bad acting, terrible script, nice love story","The poeple in the movie - sorry, can't really call them actors - are cute. And the love story between Ramon and Vince is ok (Ramon is ok, to be honest). But apart from that this movie has no saving grace. A bad script... is served by nightmare directing and editing. As for the music, well er... makes you think that the acting wasn't so bad after all... music is worse."
3,Title is misleading,"This is a pretty good book for finding interesting off-the-beaten-path places, but the title is very misleading. To me, ""Northern California"" means San Francisco to the Oregon state line. In fact, all of the tours are clustered around San Francisco or Sacramento. There's nothing north of Stewart's Point, which leaves a gap of almost two hundred miles to the Oregon state line. If the title had been more accurate, I probably would not have bought the book, since I was most interested in areas north of San Francisco."
1,Don't Buy It,"This book is so old it's more like a history book than a guide book. I don't think the Bay Area looks like this anymore. Fortunately, I'm a historical buff and a big fan of old photographs, so I enjoy looking it over."
2,Poorly researched,"I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it is well-written, and I certainly enjoyed Cowan's earlier book on shamanism. However, I am a student of the life of Desiderius Erasmus and I bought the book to examine Cowan's evidence on Erasmus' purported homosexuality. I was deeply disappointed to discover that Cowan's research on this matter was skimpy. It appears to be little more than a recitation of some earlier, equally poorly researched works. Cowan does not include some important material from the readily available Collected Works of Erasmus. Either he never bothered to do this small bit of primary research, or he deliberately suppressed some of the information to be found there. I suspect the former, because there is also some supporting information in CWE Volume 1 that he never cited.I suppose I could recommend this book to a gay man with serious self-esteem problems, but for most people, the factual errors in this book deter me from recommending it."
2,Virtually nothing for 71-73 mustangs,"Contrary to the online ""Book Description"", this book has virtually no reference to 71' to 73' Mustangs. In fact, I could only find two meager references to 71' to 73's - one sentence near the back of the book about the design change from 1970, and a few lines stating total production figures. Anyone looking for a book on 71' to 73' Mustangs will be very disappionted with this book."
4,"An EXCELLENT Reference, even if dated","This book, in the 70's, was probably a restricted text. It is an excellent insight into the flavors of explosives, methods and means by which ne'er-do-well's created Improvised Explosive Devices, and how the thin blue line rendered them safe. **VERY** specific methods of access and rendering safe procedures are shown in great detail, including photographs. While methodology and tools have advanced, it is still nonetheless an EXCELLENT reference for those interested in the secretive art of Bomb Disposal.If you find this sort of text fascinating, go buy Tom Brodies' book. Even better."
4,1984 22 foot Star Craft Islander,Excellet manual. Saved me time and money. I have been able to complete most of my repairs and maintenance myself with this book. This manual has also been borrowed by many of my friends as they worked on their boats. Super book!
2,More detailed information needed,"The first thing that I needed this book for was to replace a broken belt. The belt is in a difficult place to get at in the engine. This book does not even address HOW or The STEPS to replace this belt. I was dissapointed; however, the rest of the information in the book looks helful should I need to use it in the future."
1,1964 TO 1980 NOT 1964 TO 1991,I wanted a manual that would cover my 1987 FOUR WINNS 16 foot boat. What I got was a manual that only covered 1964 to 1980 not 1964 to 1991 that was shown in the picture. I would suggest that the ad be corrected not the miss leading one.
4,Saved A Few Dollars,"This book did help me to change a water pump in the lower unit successfully. It waseasy to follow once I idenitified which motor my boat had. Make sure you payclose attention to the order you remove parts. The pictures are clear, howeverthey don't always show every small detail, especially when replacing washers, orbolts. I saved over $200 dollars on one repair by purchasing the book. Lookingforward to saving a few more dollars when something else goes wrong."
2,Mercruiser Stern Drives 1964 - 1991 (Seloc Marine Tune-Up and Repair Manuals),"I ordered this manual to assist me in the restoration of a 1970 boat with Mercruiser I/O thinking it would be much like a Mercruiser Manual I once owned. Much of the information I need such as location and operation of switches is not there. Other things such as the inner transom plate layout are absent as well. The photos are also very poor quality reproductions, many so dark you can't see the object in question. This manual may be okay for general information, but if you are attempting a rebuild and not totally used to knowing exactly what everything looks like, where it is placed and how it functions you will need another good source of information."
4,modern snowboarding,good all around video..never gets uninteresting.... my question is when is anybody gonna come out with a video longer then 40 min??
3,laredo,"It is an easy read, good brain candy although the plot is a little predictable. I would buy it again."
2,Triple is not nearly enough...,"Thin plot, thinly developed characters, not the author's best. The Pillars of the Earth, Eye of the Needle, and Dangerous Fortune stand out as by far his best. Triple is interesting, but not nearly the suspense, drama or richly developed characters of Follett's best... not worth a read in my opinion."
4,Readable format,"Dumas is a challenge, especially his old Roman stories that assume a prior knowledge of Roman gods and places. It's good story-telling, though. The book format is readable and doesn't distract me very much."
4,Works of Alexandre Dumas (Illustrated),"Dumas is a very interesting author. Most of these books I'd not known about, but am glad that they are available on Kindle.You must realize that this man lived in a totally different world, and many references are obscure and not available in either dictionary. Also, that at this time extensive verbiage was used. However, the stories are by and large, extremely interesting in themselves and also shed light on the politics of that time. In many ways that has not changed and you will find many parallels in our own time.I have certainly enjoyed re-reading my favorites, such as the 3 Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo. However, this is certainly an extensive book and will take many days to finish the entire volume.There are a couple of problems in the Count: continuity is not very reliable in certain parts - missing or misplaced pages, and misspellings (not as intrusive and the former). I have not read the entire volume but look forward to doing so."
2,A british crime movie that tried too hard to be Snatch-like. I couldn't get into it. Not that interesting. I say C-,"After stealing a getaway car with a local crime boss in the trunk, Mickey (Gregory) is thrust into a world of human trafficking and ruthless killing. When the crime boss Don Barber is let go by Mickey he suddenly realizes that Mickey is a man he wants on his payroll. Mickey is tasked with trying to find out who attacked Don and to extract revenge. Since ""Snatch"" came out it seems like everyone is trying to make the next one, or be the next Guy Ritchie. Since ""Snatch"" I think that ""Layer Cake"" is the only one that can be compared to it. This movie is very violent and bloody, that's where the similarities end. I just really couldn't get in to this one. Some parts were pretty good, but they were few and far between. It didn't hold my attention. I give it a C-.Would I watch again? - Nope"
1,Disappointed in case,"Purchased this case for a Buffet student clarinet. While I realize that the instrument should fit snuggly, the case would not close without stressing it. Clasps needed to be forced into alignment to close, hinges looked extremely week and would break with one hard inpact in the band truck. The store was great with the return, so I would purchase from them again....the case just did not meet any of my expectations and was very cheaply made."
1,Piece of Junk!!,This clarinet case is a piece of junk. The clarinet will not even fit properly in the case and the hinges are falling apart right after we opened it out of the box.
3,"complete metalsmith, proplus edition",12/16/10: Just about 6 months late in reviewing. Received the book without the CD. It seems there are quite a few buyers who did not receive the CD......why? Found the hard cover with the spirals difficult to use. The author had added current information for PMC clay and this may have crowded the inside pages. If they would enlarge the hard cover and give more clearance for the pages there would be room to turn the pages without tearing. Perhaps the book should be in two volumes with room to expand in each volume.
3,"Complete Metalsmith, ProPlus Edition","The book is a Phenomenal wealth of knowledge. The cd that comes with it sucks and is not formatted to play on any remotely newish media player... very disappointing. I actually ordered this item twice because I thought perhaps I just received a faulty CD the first go around. Not the case, same issue with my second order. Super bummed, you should just buy the spiral bound paperback edition of the Complete Metalsmith for less $ and skip the ProPlus Edition because the interactive cd that comes with it doesn't even work."
1,Don't waste the time or money!,"I ordered the ProPlus Edition (book & cd) and received only the book. I returned it for an exchange of what I had originally ordered. Again I received the ProPlus Edition WITHOUT the cd. Unfortunately I needed it for a class. I lost time, but more importantly, trust in Amazon. To top it off, when I received a credit to my credit card for the original purchase, I was credited for a $10 book I had also ordered at the same time, NOT the $42 of the ProPlus Edition. So... I had to contact Amazon again for the full refund. Buy this product somewhere else if you need the disc included. Otherwise, the $19 version of the Pro Edition seems worth it..."
4,Good book,So far this book has been informative. We will have a better feel for how practical it is when the pool opens this summer.
2,At Best OK Book,"First, this is not a complete guide to teach infant/child to swim. This is author's experience/experiments with his Institute for Human Potential... I may play with the baby, but not to teach swimming as infant. For real training, wait until the baby is potty-trained and is ready to learn. 3-4 year-old is a perfect time.The actual swim teaching is short. It does not even touch floating devices; no easy breaststroke crawling. Find a better book."
3,Baby Swim,Ya ok book but really didn't need it just took baby to the pool and she did great ............
5,It works!! It's easy and fun!,My sister told me about this book and was using it with her 9mos old. Her baby was doing great....I decided to get the book and give it a try. I used my bathtub primarily because in WA it's cold. But every technique I tried worked like a charm. My kids got used to the water and trusted it and me. I had to pick up the book and put it down a few times but we just picked up where we left off. We had a great time still do because of the trust and things we learned practicing. The confidence my kids and I both recieved from the experience I wouldn't trade!
3,okay,I was really excited about this book but it didn't quite give me the guidance to help teach my baby to swim as easily as I had hoped.
4,Cleans very thoroughly -- even places normal floss ...,"Cleans very thoroughly -- even places normal floss doesn't. Difficult to use in tight spaces, however. Excellent product for general use."
2,I'd recommend this product only to people who ...,"I'd recommend this product only to people who have dental appliances. It's NOT a good floss for regular teeth. It has a thick part for flossing around things like braces and bridges, and a thin part that's SUPPOSED to be like normal floss. It isn't. It's too thick and not waxed enough, so it doesn't easily glide between teeth. But again, for people with dental appliances, it probably works really well."
1,Oral-B Not A Super Floss,The Oral-B super floss was impossible to insert between some of my bridges. Apparently the spacing between my teeth is too narrow. Now I am using the Crest Glide Threader Floss which works great. Just hope I can continue to buy the Threader Floss from Crest.
3,The dental floss worked just fine. I've had ...,The dental floss worked just fine. I've had problems with other brands that would shred while using them. I used to constantly have to refresh my piece of floss. That didn't happen with this product. I'd certainly buy it again.
4,"I really liked the foam type floss, it ...","I really liked the foam type floss, it makes it much more comfortable by my gums and the stiffened end helps to get under my braces. Great product."
2,"Flossing is hard, and unfortunately, this product doesn't ...","Flossing is hard, and unfortunately, this product doesn't make it any easier. First, the floss sections are too short. After wrapping each end around two fingers on each hand I had only about eight inches left. Second, it broke pretty easily. I needed to use three or four to get through all my teeth. Last, the wider section is a good idea, but when you pull on both ends of the floss (which you have to do to get it through your teeth) it disappears!"
5,Very well-made Thriller,"I've watched many Michael Caine movies and this certainly is one of his better films, my second favorite (with ""Hannah and her Sisters"" being my favorite Michael Caine film).The plot is very captivating, the actors very well cast and the locations are marvellous, especially the scenes filmed inside the windmill.I would rate ""Hannah and her Sisters"" with 6 stars, this one definitely 5 stars, but ""Alfie"" only 2 stars although it's very popular, but just not my cup of tea."
1,What a joke....,"This is probably the worst camera I ever had! Not only was the screen dominantly an orange and red hue but it says it has a microphone...and it doesn't. Just trying to play the videos themselves is a very hard chore! In fact, I wasn't able to play them at all! I could only take pictures but a not a real video. I'm returning this item and I am going to find a better one than this!"
4,mike park's new band,"The Bruce Lee band is the awesome combination of Less than Jake and Skankin' Pickle vocalist (and ska/punk legend) Mike Park! They play catchy ska/punk reminiscent of older Less than Jake, but are unmistakably the product of Mike Park's song writing skills. Most of the songs are ligh-hearted and funny, with a few exceptions (""Brother, brother,"" ""Standing up for Justice."") Basically, if you're a fan of Skankin' Pickle or Less than Jake, then you should definitly buy this. Oh yeah, and there's a ton of hidden stuff too (Less than Jake's cover of the Gilligan theme song and more!)"
5,"Jim ""Bruce Lee"" Park skanks Asian style","One of the pride & joys of my CD collection... this is some of the best ska you can buy. Jim Park, of Skankin' Pickle and the Chinkees, gets together with friends from Less Than Jake and skanks Asian style. Humorous songs like Hongulmamotaya which is Korean for 'I can't speak Korean' and the song Don't Sit Next To Me Just Because I'm Asian are great... plus there's a cover of They Might Be Giants 'She's An Angel'. Also contains bonus tracks... it's a great album!"
3,ska rules,"Bruce lee band is a kicks ska band.This is the kind of music people should listen too instead RAP!!!!! why should you , becaus. rap isnt any good ska rules and thats the bottom line."
2,A rather pointless CD,"""Bruce Lee Band"" has released likely the album that gave AMR (Asian Man Records) a bump in their money-making business. You could mailorder different CD's, and the others are much better. The songs on here are not very good. Lyrics wander off in different directions."
1,Hasta la vista,"As an alternative, please consider buying Andres Segovia's Gymnopedies or Gnossiemes by Satie. I heard Segovia was Esteban's mentor. I'm sure the skill was transferred, but there's no accounting for taste. The 2 solo guitar pieces on the album are superb, but the others are crowded by flute, drum and violin accompaniments. Esteban's talent is undeniable, but overproduction is a killer. Sorry, sir, but Esteban, as a viola soloist, I must speak my mind! Thank you for your contribution to the collective."
2,dissapointment,"Like you, I have seen the infomercials, and can appreciate the fact that Esteban is a musician, and I can appreciate the energy required to write, perform, and record music.That being said, I found this CD to be sterile and ""canned"". No emotion, it sounds like a formula is being followed: get a Spanish groove going, fill it in with a bunch of layers of other instruments. Did I mention the other instruments? At times the guitar almost disappears, lost in the mix.With all due respect, with references on other reviews to ""flamenco"" and ""master of the guitar"", you really need to get out there a bit and broaden your listening. This CD would be perfect for background in a dentist office or elevator.All in all, very lightweight music."
1,You can't be serious??!!,"I cannot believe that anyone who really understands (plays) classical guitar could think this guy is anything but a fraud. He is not a good player, he misses notes (his band hides many of his mistakes), and his guitars that he sells are junk. Do you really think this guy ""studied"" with Segovia? Give me a break! His Johnny Cash rip-off look, and his chord fingerings should give him away to anyone who plays. Do you really think that Andres Segovia taught him to finger a first position G Major like that? Sure he did! He gives classical guitar purists/virtuosos like Parkening and Williams a bad name."
2,Would not buy again,"I like his music but this CD sounds like something played in elevators, you know the brand name. Glad I didn't pay much for it."
3,Slightly disapointed,I was a little disapointed. When I listen to guitar music . . .I am generally turned off to hear any fingers sliding acroo the strings. The Masters of guitar minimize this occurance.
2,Switch quality,I've had my Streamlight for the past 15 years. I don't know what the issue is with their switches but I've had to replace 4 of them. The current switch needing replacement has been in the light for just about a year. It frequently sticks in the open position requiring me to fidget with it for a few minutes before finally getting it to turn off. Very frustrating! In addition to this flashlight I also own a MagCharger. I've owned this light for about the same number of years as the Streamlight. The only part I've had to replace on the MagCharger is the lightbulb. A far more reliable product in my opinion.This will be the last switch I replace on the Streamlight. If this switch fails it will be time to ditch this light and purchase a second MagCharger.
5,Amazing. Stunningly amazing.,"As a longtime Moyet fan, I was a bit leery of this disc being able to capture the essence of her live performance quality.Wow.From the first track until the end, all one can think is that this is the greatest vocalist of our times. Her control and pitch are beyond perfect, and the way that she delivers is...beyond description. Her songwriting skills are just as equally as perfect. Only once in a great while does such great talent emerge, and we are all blessed to be living during one of those such times. Holiday, Fitzgerald? May I introduce to you, Moyet.Thanks Alison...you done good."
3,More inspiring stuff,"I did not know about this book at all and was happy to read it thanks to it being republished by Tuchy Palmieri and Healing-habits.com.This book, as the ones previous to it, are about the rebirth of the human spirit. In Children of the Second Birth, we found more inspiring stories about being able to change yourself, your life, your way of thinking in order to be happier and feel more fulfilled. There is a very pronounced religious slant to this book and this may put off many readers, however, I have found that looking at it from a point of view of spirituality instead of full fledge religious preaching helped me see the good in the message in this book.This book is about finding oneself through spirituality and/or religion."
4,Sims Seasons for Mac,"I bought this game for my fiance, and she loves it. It offers expanded furniture, kitchen things, and clothing as well as changing seasons and 6 new careers. I would recommend this game to anyone who uses a mac and likes The Sims 2."
4,Great Product,"I ordered this game thinking I would have to send it back, for I have had bad luck with Amazon in the past. But my Sims 2 game works fine. The downloading process was a little confusing, but the outcome is great. The game plays wonderful. I would definitely buy from this guy again."
3,Few steps off,"Worth finding if 70's blues-prog is your thing, JG, unlike many artists around that time and style that should remain obscured, still holds some fiery grit as well as charmingly arranged covers."
3,Good footage and history of WWII but noisy disks,I enjoyed learning more about the history of Word War 2 but something was wrong with all the disks that were in the set. They worked but had a vibrating sound when they were spinning. Once the sound on my system was turned up I could not hear the vibrating sound but it was still there. I tried it on a different DVD player and it did the same thing so it was not my player. I was surprised that this problem was on all of the disks
2,Shipment?,I ordered this item quite some time back. It has not shipped and still has same estimated arrival date. I really hope it gets here in time for Christmas!! This is my 4th or 5th year with a prime membership and have shopped Amazon for years. This item is prime and was in stock at time of purchase but is now temp. out of stock. Wish I knew one way or the other so I could receive this item or order something else by Christmas.
4,What became of the Disciples.,"This review is for the book authored by George Jowett,pictured in this listing.Mr.Jowett gives some interesting information about Joseph of Arimethea.He tells who he was,beyond being Mary's uncle.The ""Bethany Group"" was with Joseph of Arimethea when he went to Britain.This book covers the Disciples as well as Mary,James the just,Paul,and Peter. Where they traveled and their martyrdom.Aristobulus and after him,Paul traveled to Britain.This is also a detailed history of Britain and the subject of the ""Lost Sheep"".There is also a helpful index in the back of the book.This is a good book on the subject of the Disciples and what became of them."
5,Fun forgotten country hits,"Best remembered for the early '60s smash, ""Don't Let Me Cross Over,"" the husband and wife team of Carl and Pearl Butler snuck into Nashville at a time when their brand of straightforward hard country singing shouldn't have gotten the time of day, amid all the goopy pop crossovers of the time... Yet, there they were, hitting the charts regularly with their rough, wonderful vocals and dopey songwriting -- plain old hicks with strong country backbeat. Like many of the best old hard country artists, there's very little of their material available in print today. This disc only has ten songs on it, but they're all pretty good, including such winners as ""She Didn't come Home"" and the moralistic ""Temptation Keeps Twisting Her Arm.."" Worth checking out!"
1,Don't like the way it was written,This book had so much potential to be very good but it just fell flat in every way. I'm sorry.
5,WILL THE WORLD EVER KNOW ABOUT THE AMAZING VOCAL TALENTS OF DIANE SCHUUR???,"This 1988 project finds Diane in the company of: Tom Scott, Richard Tee, Steve Gadd, Lenny Pickett, and The Edwin Hawkins Singers just to name a few. As usaul there is a wide variety of songs to pick from. The Key Tracks: ""Talkin' 'Bout You"",""Funny"", ""Something Real"". To really hear Dianne Schuur at her singin' (Sangin') best, listen to the track ""Nothing In The World"" and I don't think I'll need to do anymore convincing."
2,listened to audio version,"I listened to this while exercising at the gym.The first CD on the formation of the universe was rather dull.The second, on the development of physical science was very dull and I found myself fast forwarding at times.The third CD on dinosaurs and mass extinctions and the earths structure was ok.I did not find this to be worth continuing and deleted it.This was one of the least interesting history/science audio books I have listened to. The subject matter selected was not interesting. There is no reason to recommend this over any other similar book. I'm not faulting the text or analysis in terms of accuracy, just saying it was not enjoyable to listen to."
4,A workable intro to Ken Wilber,"Although I've never been a fan of the question and answer format, this is a utilitarian introduction to the stunning work of Ken Wilber. Without a doubt, Wilber is synthesizing a legitimate holistic worldview from a melange of seemingly disparate philosophies. I was somewhat dismayed to find his book categorized as ""New Age"" in leading bookstores. Wilber is the genuine article, however, and should be ""shelved"" next to Whitehead and his peers in philosophy"
4,I'd like the book more if he was a succussful mom,"Geez, this is a nice start, but being able to conceive, carry, birth, raise and release healthy happy kids requires much more than the basics, trust me! But i agree, he seems to have the beat, time to dance."
3,Ken Wilber,"I've not read this book and I've never read anything by Ken Wilber beyond what he has to say of Alex Grey, but come on! Just look at the man! Those glasses! He must know SOMETHING of importance."
2,Recycled 60s,"When he talks about stuff I know he is so far off, misconstruing and mistating, that it makes me doubt his discussion of areas I know less about. This is basically untestable philosophy, which you may like of not. But it is way far from new, as any of us old 60s folks can recall. To paraphrase an old article in psychology: what's true isn't new, and what's new isn't true. Read some neuropsych instead."
2,A book that befuddles,"He seeks out a lot of important ground and introduces you to it in his own evangelistic way, inextricably mixing in his many confusions. The innocent who reads this book first will probably struggle to unlearn it for decades."
1,A brief mystery of nothing,"This book is clearly not a scholarly work, in my opinion. This is not a history book. The contents of the book are, in my opinion, pseudo-intellectual babble. I feel dumber for having read as much of the book as I did before throwing it into the trash. You have been warned."
1,Dissappointment,"I was looking forward to reading Ken Wilbur's book, expecting a logical, ""scientific"" explanation for many questions which I had. Instead, what I read was a series of ""spiritual musings"", an author who likes to hear himself write, sententeces full of words, signifying nothing. The form in which the book is written, a question and answer interview, is a good one but it still did not help in clarifying Mr. Wilbur's point of view. Indeed, it is difficult to say what Mr. Wilbur is trying to say although he uses a great many words to say it."
1,Nothing new here-old wine in new bottles,"Look beneath the buzzwords and you find a patriarchal and repressive philosophy of life.Wilber claims our major problems are simply the growing pains of evolution.His answer is become like a Zen monk and transcend the world to live in pure spirit.He ignores the class nature of society and deliberate exploitation and alienation of people by others in the pursuit of power and profit.He criticises feminists and ecologists for not having complete answers, but at least they are concerned about the state of the world.He has nothing new to say.For example,Qabalah and hermetic thought(""As it is above, so it is below"") go a lot deeper into things than he does.We need individual and social action to create a better world, not the old hat Eastern navel gazing which he offers in this book.I recommend that Ken read ""Voices of the First Day"" by Robert Lawlor for some real insights into the state of things."
4,not bad,"I have just finished reading reader's comments and I find it interesting that Ken's biggest detractors on this page have spelled his last name wrong. Not only that, but their spelling in general leaves something to be desired. To be sure what is presented here is no great revelation for any serious student of philosophy- it has been written a thousand times before. But he must be commended on his unique and entertaining way of getting the point across. There is definitely something to be said about his fluency and the clarity of his thoughts. Here is a true scholar. I feel sorry for the readers not able to appreciate the truth and the beauty contained here."
5,A fun trip of discovery to humankind,"Ken Wilber has indeed presented a genuine masterpiece. The infinite spirit of who, what and why are touched but not overdosed. He clearly has enjoyed writting this and if God were to write a review..it might read ""Your getting close Ken! Well Done"""
5,What Philosophy Was Meant To Be,"Cautiously, this book absorbs a great deal of knowledge and synthesizes it with considerable alacrity, acuity, conciseness, and coherence. The book will be attractive to a large number of readers who are looking for an ""integrative"" approach to knowledge. As one with a philosophical bent, I appreciated the inclusion of Whitehead's Process Reality and Bergson's Creative Evolution, which have largely been abandoned by collegiate, philosophical departments. Einstein and Darwin are also included. Science, philosophy, wisdom, psychology, and spiritualism are all integrated into a nice coherent system.My only reservations are linguistic, which often is hokey, and tone, which is often authoratative rather than heuristic."
2,Could be more informed,"I'd like to see Mr. Wilbur wrap his brilliant mind around more current information instead of western centric notions displayed in Cartesian format with an overlay of Buddhist meditation without the essence of spirituality.There is simply too much misinformation about societal developments, particularly in the Americas to take this work too much to heart.In the end, it was just more of the same dribble just presented with a little more clarity.'I was keenly disappointed."
4,The Pete Townshend Big Band?,"That's actually what I called this recording, when I learned the Who would tour, but with Townshend's current band, Deep End.Needless to say, the band rocked its way through ""Tommy"" and a number of old hits, and it must have been a hell of a show to see (I sadly missed the Foxboro, MA show in '89).The lineup was different this time for a number of reasons: Townshend was suffering from tinnitus and so Steve Bolton was hired to handle lead guitar (which I thought was good, but a bit more flash than Townshend's). There were the backup singers, extra percussion, extra this and that, and it made for a fuller sound. I rather liked the band doing ""Tommy"" on this, rather than the all-star lineup you see in the video.All around, a good solid performance, though perhaps not what purists would like to have heard."
1,PAINFULL TO READ,"YOU'VE HEARD THE TERM `HOT AIR'. IN THE DICTIONARY THIS BOOK IS REFERED AS A PERFECT EXAMPLE. THE AUTHOR IS A SNOB, AND THAT COMES THROUGH IN EVERY OTHER WORD. I DIDN'T SEE ANY DATES, SO IT WAS WORTHLESS TO ME. IF YOU DON'T NEED DATES OR FACTS THIS IS YOUR BOOK!"
4,Idiot Flesh is a unique and intriguing band (,"The Nothing Show (according to me) was perhaps the best album I've heard from Idiot Flesh. I was not too thrilled when I heard Fancy. It was too negative and morbid to be anywhere as good as the Nothing Show. The band however, was fairly unique and intriguing and had quite possibly a completely different sound from other bands I've heard. Overall, Idiot Flesh rules! It' a shame they broke up though."
3,"""Doo-Bop Song"" instrumental","What's worthwhile about this disc is the instrumental version of ""The Doo-Bop Song"" (Edit Without Rap). I like this song, but I don't like the rapping, so I had to get the version without rapping.Beware that the ""instrumental version"" on this disc does not have Miles Davis's trumpet playing. The ""edit without rap"" is the good version.The Doo-Bop producer Easy Mo Bee went on to produce Biggie, Tupac, and others.This disc is worth it if you can find a cheap copy and you want to hear ""Doo-Bop Song"" without the lackluster rapping."
4,I used it to cut out pretzel strips,"I tried all kinds of ways to roll the pencil size dough strings for pretzels. By hand, impossible, with a spaghetti tube on the meat grinder of my Kitchen Aid stand mixer, what a mess. Then it occurred to me to roll out a long strip of dough and use this from the drawer. If I'd run it over the dough twice, I could have created pencil sized strips, but I ran it once and made street vendor size pretzel strips. They were beautiful pretzels and so very easy. I didn't roll the crinkles out but could have easily. I just wanted to see what they did with the crinkles. Most faded away with the rise and during baking. I'm no longer dreading making pretzels again."
3,Not as strong as I had hoped,"When pressing down on the dough, the ends of the pasta bike pop out. It is easy to use and adjust for different sizes, but the wheels ARE plastic."
3,Cutter Makes the Cut,"This pasta cutter offers some versatility in size of cuts however, the design that makes it easy to change sizes also makes it easy for the arm to pop of while in use. The trick is to find the right amount of pressure - enough to cut the dough but not so much as to pop the arm. It would have been nice of the design included a wing-nut or something on the outside of the arm to keep it in place during use. The device does however make beautiful, even cuts of pasta."
3,pasta cutter,"I give it there stars because ,it dose not cut through good , when you press harder the roller part falls off . Other wise it makes a really nice design. ,wide or narrow ."
1,The Conditions for A Coma,"I would call this ""The Conditions for A Coma."" The greatest utility I have ever found for this book was placing it on my nightstand, with George Bush's ""A Charge to Keep."" Seven minutes has been the record.With more than fifteen years in training, I have not used the book as it was intended. If you have a college professor who makes you read this, I advise you to swear out a complaint as soon as possible.Buy this at your peril. All the speed or caffeine in the world will not get you through this."
5,VERY GOOD CD!,This CD is one of the best of modern/contemporary music I have ever purchased. I love it!So relaxing So calm So wonderful
4,"The uest is a great GPS, just five years old","GPS, QUEST STREET NAVIGATOR, POCKET (0100030600)The Quest is a great GPS, a little older technology but very good. I sed mine for 3000-5000 mile road trips with 4X4 trails along the way. Over 10,000 miles of routes so far and never missed a turn.... Ron"
1,not a happy customer,"I am not very happy with this, according to the direcions, and the web sight, the gamins Quest should find addresses, and points of interrest like hotels, resturants ect. but it does not, almost like it it missing some of the programming. I tried to get help online, but none is availible. I would probebly like it for off road use, but for turn by turn in a car, it just sucks."
1,This thing is JUNK,"Maps really aren't detailed enough to use. It just gives you the general idea of where in the area you are. It does not compare favorable with any other GPS I have seen. This product has been disscontinued by Garmin and now after all the money I have spent, I know why. Don't buy it unless all you want to know is what city you are in."
4,A Book for Dragon Lovers,"This is a wonderful two-part invention: On one level it's a whimsical romp of a detective story pairing two of the most unlikely but loveable detectives. On another level it's a dark brooding piece with brief, insightful philosophical ponderings from the dragon's point of view asking deep questions of `what does it mean to be a dragon?' and `why search for the horde?' The main character, Eppy, is part MacGuyver, part Fox Mulder, and part Mr. Mxyzptlk. He is a draconologist who comes to the Windy City to investigate robberies at art museums, and has a theory his family and the police don't particularly fancy. He embarks on a journey that is fast-paced and fascinating, providing an overall enjoyable read dragon lovers don't want to miss. As a note of trivia, Anne McCaffrey fans will get a kick out of the prologue and epilogue in which she herself is a character in the novel playing a pivotal role in getting things rolling."
5,What amazing talent,"A pity the talented group does'nt exist anymore. Surely a must have for any serious 'Flame' fan or 'The Flames' as we know them in the country of their birth, South Africa. Not so sure that the quality of the sound recording does the group proud. I've been fortunate in seeing the group perform live in South Africa on more than one occasion and they sure reigned supreme in their heyday. I bought the LP with the same title years ago and was struck by the group's resemblance to the now exctinct 'Fab Four' at the time. Blondie Chaplin, most successful member of the group is still performing with the 'Stones' on their recent tour. Need I say more??? Go buy the cd you won't be sorry!"
4,"Good, but There's an Alternative...","This product is great for beginning game developers. I would say 90% of the activities that one carries out in this softwared are ""Drag-n-Drop"". There are plenty of tutorials that are easy to follow.However, if you are an experienced game designer, or are totally enthusiastic toward game design/development, then you might prefer investigating a less expensive alternative, yet one that may prove to be more flexible... ""Game Maker"".The ""Game Maker"" software follows the same drag-n-drop philosopy, but also incorporates the use of a scripting language if you find the need for this. The basic software is free with unlimited use. In addition, upgrading to the Pro edition, from the free, is only $20.00! You might want to give this software a try before you purchase TGF, at $50+ dollars."
5,Classic in Devotion,"Fosdick's classic devotional meditation on the human character of Jesus of Nazareth. Twelve weeks of daily scripture/comment/prayer, with a longer comment on the weekly theme at the end of the week. The following dimensions of Jesus' character make up the weekly themes: Joy, Magnanimity, Indignation, Loyalty to His Cause, Power of Endurance, Sincerity, Self-Restraint, Fearlessness, Affection, Scale of Values, Spirit, The Measure of the Stature of the Fullness of Christ."
3,Foam mat!,"I bought this Foam mat to make exercising on my carpet floor more comfortable. Overall, it is a nice thick mat and works great for exercise. The mat is a little narrow for me so I'd suggest getting a 4-foot wide mat if you are a regular sized person. Like the other reviewers have pointed out, it doesn't completely unroll flat but it is flat enough and there is a slight odor that goes away after a while."
5,Serves its purpose and easy to clean,"Not much to say. It serves its purpose. It attracts dust a bit (when you lay it on dust), but with damped paper towel, or just your hands wiping off would do.Not much to say, but it's working as advertised. The foam is thick enough when you lay on it too."
3,Nice product,The pruduct is good but is kind of weak and not that good for chunches it's more for joga and streching inatead
5,Perfect,"This turned out to be a great buy for me. I began doing P90X, and this mat makes it so much easier to do the ab training and other floor exercises. It fits my needs perfectly. Mine doesn't roll up like others have said and I have jumped and stretched on it without it ripping. perhaps other exercises can cause this but I have not had that issue at all. The $15 or so bucks I spent on it was well worth the money!!!!"
4,great exercise mat,"Great quality mat for the price! good size and very good thickness. I really like the velcro straps to keep it rolled up when not in use. Shipped quickly, too."
4,good for the price,"The fitness center at work does not have mats, so I wanted one I could keep under my desk. It rolls up nicely with velcro and the only thing that would make it better would be if it had a handle. It's thick enough to provide padding, but doesn't take up much room. When it's unrolled, it tends to roll back up, but if you put the flattest part by your feet, it's very useable."
3,OK but smells and overpriced,"As other reviewers have said, this mat has a strong smell. When I first opened the box, it was overpowering. I figured it was from being packed in a box in the heat, but weeks later, it still smells like burning rubber. If the smell is from poor-grade latex in the rubber, as I suspect it is, it will likely get stronger. Maybe I got a mat that was kicking around for a while, and the rubber is starting to degrade already?For the quality, $19 is overpriced. I recently saw a better quality Everlast mat at my local discount department store for about the same price. Other online retailers are selling this same mat for $10.Lastly, another reviwer said this mat is 1"" thick, and it's not--closer to 1/2"". It is very soft though.These things said, it's a good enough mat at a not-so-great price."
1,Just a simple foam mat,This mat is nothing but a camping mat with straps attached. You can pick one up at any porting goods store for $10.00
1,Damaged after one minute!,"I was sorely disappointed by this product. Two things:1) Horrible quality. I unwrapped the mat, did a plank for one minute, and...voila. My elbows had ripped through the surface of the mat. Did a few pushups, and my hands also left permanent impressions. I weigh 145 lbs, and my hands and elbows are smooth as a baby's bottom, I promise. I have a picture, and I'll try to get it uploaded.2) Smells like oil. I live in a single in a college dorm, and this mat stinks up my entire room. I have to air out my room constantly so I don't feel overwhelmed.Bottom line: if you're looking to buy a mat for any type of exercise besides stretching, I highly recommend you stay away from this product."
4,Its OK.,"This is pretty good,really foamy,doubled sided(ribbed and plain),easy storage straps.Really good for doing sit ups/etc...The only con is that it folds up on the sides sometimes,other than that,a great buy."
3,Good for Price,"I need a thicker foam mat for my Physique 57 workout videos, and it generally serves it's purpose. However, it doesn't lay out flat which can be a bit annoying."
5,It's great!,"This mat is great for doing crunches on a very hard floor because it is thick. It is not made to do cardio on - in my opinion, but for isometric exercises it is great! The one edge doesn't roll all the way down, but I just flip the mat over and use the other side and it flattens it enough for me. I love that it is easy to store because it rolls up and has velcro."
4,buy it if,great mat for general exercise. thick and supportive. not great for yoga because single leg balance poses are much more difficult on a thick foam surface.
5,Exactly what I needed,"Bought this for when I can't make it to the gym. After looking around at different mats and reading reviews like, ""this one is too thin,"" and ""this one is too short,"" I settled on this and it's perfect. People complain about the end curling up but it doesn't affect anything you do on the mat - either you are tall enough to have your head or feet weighing the curled part down so it's flat, or you are short enough that you don't even reach it. I'm 6'2"" and this mat is actually long enough for me (something I couldn't even find at the gym). Definitely recommended."
5,MORE THAN WORTH THE PRICE,"I purchased this mat over a year ago to go along with my p90x workouts. Perfect mat, this mat is even better then the mats they have at my gym (La Fitness). Soft and comfy, doesn't slide (I use on carpet thought), and durable. I wipe it down after I finish my workout and when its dried (rather quickly), I roll it up. Its convenient because it has the straps to keep it rolled up. It is still more than worth the price and I believe I got it for even cheaper at the time of my purchase."
2,Noisy,This mat squeaks and makes a lot of noise when you're using it . It distracts me from my workout.
4,Stinky Mat,I love this product. I have a slight tailbone issue and found it hard to do floor exercises without pain. I purchased this mat because it was of thicker dimension.This would have been a five star purchase however the mat itself stinks. The smell is not intolerable however it's enough to be distracting.Overall great purchase for prime price.
3,Good but plastic-y in the hot,"This mat is well priced and does the job, as far as exercise mats go. However, hot weather causes it to stink up a room with rubber fumes. So have a think before you purchase it."
4,Saves lower back,This mat is great for any exercise or stretching that has you on your back or sitted position. Wouldn't use it for any movement exercise a running in place etc.
4,"Good mat, but smells","Good exercise mat, but it has a very strong rubber smell. My apartment isn't big, so the place reeked of rubber for a while."
4,Confy,"I really like the mat; its confy and think for my knee @ my yoga. However, the edges stay folded after you release to start yoga. I wish it was just like the regular yoga mats"
4,Simple and good.,"Not very fancy, but serves the purpose. Easy to roll and store. Comfortable to use."
3,Valeo Foam Mat,"I normally order the Valeo Foam Mats from Amazon and always have been pleased with the shipment and they way the mats are packed. But this time, I have to say I'm disappointed. The mats are normally encased in plastic but this time, no plastic to protect the mats and therefore the ends of the mats were all flipped up, bent and creased. Not acceptable. Please bring back the plastic covering to protect the mats from damage."
2,Average product...go for something better,Not a great product. The mat curls up at one end and this makes it a bit uncomfortable to use.
2,It's ok,"I had high hopes for this product. However, it is quite too long and it has a squishy texture that is hard to keep your balance on when it comes to leg lifts."
1,Got mine used....... mat has stretch marks on it,"This mat is alright. It is really bad for yoga because it stretches a lot and you can fall. For the mat itself, 3 stars.But one star for the distributor. When my mat arrived, there were noticeable friction marks on the mat where you can see that someone previously rubbed on them and stretched them out. It makes me kind of queasy to use a mat after thinking someone has already drenched their sweat on it. I would try to return this, but I have yet to find a box big enough to fit the mat."
4,good pad.,"I have a bit of experience with this pad since having purchased it. First, judging from other reviews, I stored it under my bed for a couple of weeks while not using it for ab work. The smell of the foam goes away for the most part. So the ""strong chemical smell"" people complained about does fade until its really not that noticeable. I Also used this pad for camping out in southern Utah for a few nights. I had a car nearby, so I wasn't using it for a back backing pad. It would have been too bulky for that purpose. In any case. Good pad. I would recommend it."
3,Nice but not for a hard workout,"I bought this mat to use with myP90X Workout DVDs. I wanted to use it as:- yoga mat,- padding for jumping jacks/running/lounges,- ab workIt is ideal for ab work - it has a great thickness and the foam gives very good padding. But for the rest, it's not so good. For yoga, whenever I'm in a position that requires to stretch and press against the floor (like downward dog, for instance), the mat stretches with me, which is very frustrating. And it may be dangerous.When I jump on it, it tends to move just a tiny bit, and the foam rubbing against the floor makes an awful, loud noise.Plus, I used it while wearing my cross-training shoes, and my foot touched the mat while bringing a leg forward in a plank. It ripped it.I would give it 2 1/2 stars, but it's not an option. It's a nice enough mat, but you need to use it for static stuff only, and probably not wear shoes with a substantial sole."
4,decent for the price,"Good solid exercise mat. I use it mainly to stretch and do ab work. Only annoyance is that since it rolls up, it tends to stay rolled at the very end, instead of being laid out flat. But it's not really an issue for me, because I don't stretch my body the entire length of the mat."
2,Thin and doesn't stay flat,"I bought this mostly for situps. The foam isn't thick enough to satisfactorily deaden the impact with the floor. The mat will also not stay flat easily. It stays flat enough with body weight on it, but the ends still curl. When not on the mat, it buckles in the middle."
2,Can't really recommend this...,"Ok, this is a big thick cushy foamy mat... It's very comfortable as a result...However, that thick cushion makes balancing in yoga poses even more difficult for the balance impaired. And more importantly, the material the made is made from is fort of a rubbery foam with little texture thus if you sweat, especially if you sweat a lot, it will give you no traction. None...As both balance and traction are critical for yoga, I would not recommend this as a yoga mat... perhaps as a situp mat..."
5,Great Exercise Mat!,Great exercise mat for the money. It's super comfortable even on hardwood floors. Rolls up really easily for convenient storage. Great buy all in all!
2,"Sticky, weird smell, recoils","I bought this mat for general home workout use, and used it once at a hot yoga studio.The ridges in the material cause it to keep its shape when you keep it rolled up, but unless you own a home (I don't) you generally don't have the space to keep it rolled out all the time. It sticks to my gym shoes and my hands, and the smell when you first get it is pretty strong. It was a nightmare trying to clean the sweat off of it from the hot yoga session too (I probably should have brought a beach towel for the top though)If you're looking for a mat to keep rolled out all the time and for weightlifting it works but for other purposes it's not quite right."
4,A good mat.,Bought this for use for a pilates class. It serves the purpose and has held up. Very comfortable. Easy to clean. Highly recommended!
3,Missing pieces!,My son received this for Christmas only to find that it was impossible to put together! It is missing pieces to finsih it. It made for a sad toy for a little boy. I will try to contact the company and see if they come through with the missing pieces and update when I get a response. Knowing what I know right now... I wouldn't recommend.
4,Follow-up EP to 17 Reasons,This is a great-follow up EP to 17 Reasons and is the last Link 80 release featuring the late great Nick Traina. Recommended.
3,Boring?? If this movie bores you.....,"...then you have some serious problems. Dead Doll is a very disturbing film about an loopy artist who kills his wacky girlfriend then preserves her body with some chemicals so he can keep her around. Even more disturbing is that the cadaver gets stolen by one sicko then another, to be defiled again and again; ending in madness and murder.I guess the director/writer was trying to make a statement, in a very shocking and sometimes humourous way, about obsession and beauty and how some people get messed up by these concepts. The pacing of the film could be better along with its production values but it did not bore me."
4,Intelligent Horror,"This movie is a parody of all the sex and violence Hollywood pumps out. Dark humor points a finger at the souless worshipping and selling of ""Barbie doll"" beauty in this culture.Dead Doll's symbolism depicts crimes against women.Crimes perpetrated by men driven mad with self loathing. Men [and one woman] too weak to control the animal side of their natures.Dead Doll makes it's points with intensity!"
1,Think twice before purchasing this film.,"It has always been my policy not to throw books or movies away; rather retain them for later use or to give away. This movie has challenged my policy. It was a truly horrible movie with no redeeming values. Even as a dark horror, it lacked substance. The Internet Movie Database lists this move has a comedy/horror, but I did not see any comedic value to the film."
1,very bad,"the movie is a bore because none of the characters are even remotely likeable. there is nothing in this movie to draw a viewer into it. clearly, the writers and director never took a writing course of any sort. the characters in this movie are one dimensional, and very dislikeable. all characters should have some kind of complexity or fullness. the movie characters are mean spirited and nothing more. their dialogue and acting are for shock only. only it doesn't work. in the back cover, they describe the female as seducing others and luring them to their deaths. wow, someone has no idea what the word seduction means. there is nothing seductive or erotic in this film. nudity alone doesn't make a flick seductive or erotic. minimal special features. would like to have heard a commentary on how this thing got the distribution it did. skip this over-priced mess. or wait until there are a ton of used copies, which seems to be piling up now."
3,Change is Continuous,"The production is of high quality and worth the purchase. The tape offers two versions of Suparinpei. One done substantially more slowly than the other one, other than the speed, there is no real difference. I did not find the performance of the kata as dynamic as Higaonna Sensei has performed them on other tapes.Higaonna Sensei performs the kata a little differently on these tapes than he did in the Panther videos, but all things change, and he is certainly qualified to change what ever he desires. Personally, I found the Japanese Production of Higaonna Sensei performing all of the kata (1979-Reproduction also offered by Tsunami), and the performances on the Panther Videos significantly more dynamic than on this tape. If you are a Goju Ryu practitioner, this tape is still a worthy addition to your library."
2,If this is green.....,"This is an average shirt. I definitely would not call it ""Stonewash Green"". It is more like light ""sort of dingy green""."
4,Great shirts,"A little thicker and warmer than I expected. Surprisingly nice quality. You might want to buy a size larger than usual though, because they do run a little small. For instance, the large fits me like a medium usually would."
2,Not so good,"Upon the first where it is excellent. Once you start washing it though, expect trouble. It does not stand up well to washing it all. In my wash on gentle cycle, with gentle detergent, in the most gentle fashion. I would say find a different product."
2,OK,"I got a large (I wear a medium) just because it's cotton and I figure it might shrink. Well, it did shrink -- much more than I expected. Probably next time I would get an ex-large, just because I like them roomy, expecially for exercise."
4,nice,These are a great set I really like them the ONLY complaint that I would have would be that they need to be a tad longer. Other than that they have been great and I use the often
4,Sort of short on length but good quality,"These bands are a bit short (4 ft?), as I like them longer to use for my shoulders by anchoring them under my foot. However, there is a noticeable difference in the resistance of the 3 colors (yellow, weaker; red, middle; blue,heavier), so I appreciate that. The bands seem of a good quality, and the price was pretty reasonable. I used the blue and red ones for a short workout already, and could feel the difference between them and the old ones for sure. All in all, worth the money."
5,prompt!,Arrived promptly and was exactly what I ordered. I like that they are quite long and have different strengths - perfect for my workouts! Thx!
4,Valeo stretch bands,"These bands are good, but I think a little short. The blue band gives quite a bit of resistance and is a good resistance workout. The red is a good medium band and the yellow is pretty mild resistance. I am just starting working with the bands and have seen a difference in my body, but again, they are a little short (and I am a short 5'1"") so you have to really pull them tight to work legs. This is ok for the yellow band, but the blue one is pretty strong and pulling it tight can get difficult. Overall, they are pretty good and the price is right so I am happy."
2,exercise bands,"These 4' Valeo bands are too short for most exercises, I was not able to do most of the exercises in my Denise Austin book. 5.5' to 6' is a better length"
4,Valeo Stretch Bands,"I use Linda Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds exercise program and she uses stretch bands. I was disappointed that these were so short! They're usable, but just barely. Oh well. If I lose the weight I hope to lose, they should be about right in length sometime next year."
2,These are not looped/connected at the ends,"They would be so much more useful if they were looped instead of just a straight band. I had to tie knots in them for most exercises. They are also kind of cheap and don't offer as much resistance as I would have liked, they are very thin. You get what you pay for..."
3,"Great Resistances, but not long enough.","I bought these bands to use with a workout video and figured the three different resistances would be perfect for when I was using different muscles. However, the bands are not long enough to do most of the workouts I wanted to use them for. Great for one arm resistance training at a time, but they're hard to use for both arms and can't really be used for overhead exercises."
4,Great product,"I have no complaints about these except, when you use them your hands smell like rubber, even after repeated washing."
2,Horrible unless you're under 5 ft.,Forget these unless you are petite. Many exercises require the bands to to wrap around a foot or knee and come up to both hands. These are so short that the tasks are impossible to complete with them.You'll want bands that are about 6 or even 6.5 feet. Scott Pilates makes them and a few others but you'll have to read the descriptions to be sure. Avoid being attracted to the cheap price. By virtue of you having to buy the correct kind later they are very expensive.
3,not what i expected,"I liked the product, but it wasn't what i expected.The bands were too short and therefore made my workouts very hard."
5,Great for hanging ferns on deck rail!,I was looking to create a natural privacy screen from our neighbors and this hook was perfect to hang large ferns. They have been through two long seasons and are still good. I had to put a little WD-40 to loosen one part up but this it to be expected. Heavy duty and perfect for what I needed.
2,Picture didn't match,"I ordered this with the excitement of a 10 year old on Christmas- I've been desperately looking for the Where in The World is Carmen Sandiego that I played when I was a litle girl. I ordered this one because the picture of the item showed the version I've been looking for-the 1996 version, however, when I got the CD, I got the 2001 version, which is A) not the one I want, and B) not the one in the picture. I wish they would've specified to me that they were going to send me the 2001 version instead of having me order it thinking that I was purchasing the 1996 version (which again, is the version pictured). The only good thing about my experience is that I got the shipment really fast-about 3 days after I placed the order."
3,Not the same as I remember,"My children love to play this game. However, if you, like me, used to play this game as a child and loved it, you may be a little disappointed. It is not the same game. But it is a ""new and improved"" game. Still, like I said the kids like it. It is a little more difficult finding the clues then I remember."
2,Not quite what I expected from DK,"We have other ""Eyewitness"" books which we enjoy very much. This one is a disappointment. The writing was less inspired, the research less extensive, even the illustrations seemed lackluster. I don't know what happened when they produced this book, but it just isn't what I have come to expect from DK."
3,It Was O.K.,"Having found the King Arthur and Dracula's in this series good, this Robin Hood showcases mideival life very well. I liked it."
5,Hillage at his best.,"This is one of Steve Hillage's finest solo moments. This brilliantly executed live disc allows him to shed some of his studio overindulgences and cut loose with some inspired, innovative and skillful playing. The backing band is more than up to the task. Strong compositions. Fine addition to your progressive rock collection. Highly recommended...Simon"
5,Phenomenal Collaboration...,"Gary Burton is arguably the greatest vibraphonist ever. Where others (Hampton, Jackson) have been great stylists, Burton revolutionized the way the instrument is played. His collaborations with Corea and Metheny have set duet standards, and this reunion album reminds us how creatively powerful Burton and Metheny are together. Having just heard them together again at the Ravinia Festival in Chicago on June 15th 2006 I can testify that their musical potency and dialogue is only getting stronger. I have my fingers crossed for a ""Re-reunion"" album!"
4,Interesting One-Off,"Pat Metheny played with vibist Gary Burton as a young guy from Berklee, and this reunion pairs them on a program of pleasant improvisations. It sounds a lot like a mid-career Pat Metheny album, which is to say pretty good, indeed."
4,"great band, great compostitions","Although there is nothing ""out"" about this release, the coherency and interplay between these supremely gifted muscicians more than makes up for any lack of avant approaches. To be honest there is something simple and beautiful to these compositions- a few by the great Vince Mendoza - that brings you into an inviting musical space. There is planty of flash and flair in the solos but they all seem to fit perectly within the setting. Even Pat's ""clams"" sound good. Recommended."
3,It's good enough...,"It's got the TnA, the gore and the really weird twist at the end you never see coming, so it gets 3 stars. But in my opinion there are far better movies from Thailand (mainly Shutter and Alone)."
3,Same formula...Hot ladies!,The positive about this film is the ladies are absolutely gorgeous and the gore is nice. The downfall is it is your typical long haired scorned female out for revenge. Decent film but very cliche.
1,SICK NURSES is sickeningly BORING & STUPID,"Asian horror-it is extremely rare you will find anything good. I find most of them are cheap imitations of THE RING, or THE GRUDGE-with the long hair and creepy girl. This is no exception-you have creepy girl with long black hair. Sounds familiar? The acting is downright stupid, and I have an extremely difficult time keeping my attention on this piece of trash. On the plus side there are a few nice gorey scenes, but, well, that's about it. Stupid idiotic acting, a very disjointed plot (typical of a lot of new Asian horror)-hard to understand, and BORING. A few nice gory scenes do not make a good movie. UNLESS you like young semi-nude asian girls squealing (rediculous screaming-which is obviously very silly and fake due to BAD ACTING), even a scene where a girlie is bulemic and you get to (oh joy) look at her vomit-then by all means get this movie. But I was NOT looking for an asian flick. HORROR THIS MOVIE IS *NOT*."
1,Not worth your money,"Save yourself time and money and don't buy this book! This book was given to me recently at a conference. Several of the phrases used in this book are taken from other education books. Also, I met some of the staff from the author's school district that she has recently left. She believed in this book so much that she didn't even share it with her staff in Texas."
1,"Boring, trite and just plain wrong","The authors clearly do not understand the concept of statistical significance which is critical for decision making. In one examples the authors indicate a school has a problem based on the test scores from a minority group of four. A big no-no!The most asked question in school districts- Since my standardized test scores went from 1435 last year to 1400 this year, do I have a problem? - is not addressed."
3,"Cool idea, but not for all kids","I got this for my daughter when I couldn't find her regular toothpaste she liked. Thought the BubbleMint would be interesting, and it actually has an interesting smell, but my daughter was not to excited about it. She normally loves breashing her teeth, lost some interest while using this, but was happy to brush her teeth once she went back to her original toothpaste. It might be good at cavity protection, but only if you can get your kids to use it. Although BubbleMint might sound good in theory, but the actual taste is not there."
2,Very misleading title,"If you step into the Java universe bubble, then ""Java Collections"" means the standard core API with the same name. This book does not cover the standard classes and interfaces that form the Java Collections API, and this is a real shame. I don't like books that feature highly misleading titles, because it hints at a lack of accuracy of the book's content."
5,Excellent Sub-Woofer,I have had this sub-woofer for almost 8 years now and it still performs as good as the day I first got it and it's been played at extremely high levels lots of times. It is one tough sub. It sounds great with both movies and music. It cranks out nice crisp/clean bass and is not boomy like a lot of other subs out there. The cabinet is built like a brick and it very strong and solid. I can't remember how many times my kids have sat on it and used it as a chair over the years. Hehe... I know this review is long over due but I happened to come across this on the net and decided to write a simple review. Bottom line is this sub rocks!
4,The Muppet Show - The Complete Third Season,The Muppet Show - The Complete Third SeasonThis was a marvelous collection of the third season of The Muppet Show. Many bright stars of the time are on here. The only thing I wish would be added - maybe to the next couple of seasons is that there would be a brief biography of the guest. Sometimes I don't know who they are or what they were famous for and the show only shows a brief look at their talents - many times expanding out of their known talents. It's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It's one of the things that I liked about the first season with the pop up trivia.
5,still fun after all these years,"My husband is a big Muppets fan, and when he found out Season Three was out on DVD, he didn't even ask.. he just ordered it. sure, some of the guests stars we are like: Huh? whozzat? but all in all, it's a great romp overall."
5,A great season of a classic show,"I am a longtime Muppets fan, and season three is when the show really hit its stride. If showstopping musical numbers, humor equal parts pun-derful and absurd, and an affectionate ribbing of show business are your things, you can't miss The Muppet Show Season Three. Episode highlights for me included the gorgeous voice of Pearl Bailey, the hilarious Gilda Radner, the surprisingly game Alice Cooper, and Roy Rogers with Dale Evans."
5,The Muppet Show - Season 3,"Who wouldn't love this? Great gift.It is so silly to require a certain amount of words for these comments, isn't it?"
5,Love this!,"This is a wonderful purchase. Season three just keeps things rolling on The Muppets. The characters are developing so well,not to mention the show as a whole. You will definitely notice new camera angles and parts of the theater you have not yet seen. The guests are as top notch stars as you could get in those days. I have truly enjoyed watching these first three seasons as an adult and I am amazed at how much I can remember. This is still one of my favorite programs. Oh yeah, my kids like it too!Its a good thing you can't wear out a DVD! I cannot wait for season four!"
4,The Muppet Show the third season,This version is one of the best. I really liked the choice of guest stars and the creative use of old and new songs for them to perform ! Great!
2,unexpected adult language in some of the jokes for my kids,"We ordered this for my 4 yrs old who loves Swedish Chef thinking it would be a great gift. Overall it has been, but there has been some adult language in some of the jokes that is not appropriate for children."
4,missing just one key thing,"there might not be commentaries but at least put in the muppet morsels again. the past two seasons on dvd have had everything you want except for the morsels. there's alot of guests i still don't know anything about or even more muppets, jokes and gags i wanna more about. bring this feature back and these dvds get nothing but 5 stars."
1,Don't Buy This Book!!!,"This book doesn't have MOST of the evangelical college luminaries in it....Wheaton, Biola, Multnomiah, Pensacola, Liberty, ORU, Moody, New St. Andrews...I am really glad I got it out of the library otherwise I would be REALLY mad!"
4,Carson is an inspired guide,"Carson is an inspired guide through the tangled and fragmentary corpus of Greek lyric love poetry. She has a whirlwind mind and a gift for pithy expression, though once in a while she slips into a kind of gauzy equivocating that weakens her arguments. Still, this idiosyncratic take on ancient eros has moments of great insight and deserves the attention of classical scholars and non-specialists who are interested in the topic."
5,Anne Carson's Best Book,"This is a delightful book that analyzes love [desire] through classical literature. It is an academic treatise, poetical prose, and philosophy all at the same time. Carson's close reading and her wit make Eros the Bittersweet a must read."
2,The color bleeds,I was disapointed that the navy color bled onto the white of the blanket. The blanket material itself seems very good quality and it is oversized so it goes into a swaddle easily...however it doesn't stay swaddled very well. The only swaddle that has worked for us (and we have tried many) is the kiddopotamus swaddle with velcro...that one worked great.
4,wonderful mobile,"i received this mobile as a gift and i love it!! Our daughter falls asleep every night watching all the pictures, all of which can be changed with replacement pictures, that come with the mobile. I especially love the music and the remote control that you can use to start the music, which is great when you're in another room!! This was a great gift!"
1,don't waste your money!,"We registered for two of these mobiles for our twins. We recieved both of them. Upon putting them together, we realized that the mobile can't operate without the pieces hitting the bar that holds it to the crib! How annoying! We returned them both."
3,Just plain nice,"For a fast read, of good Christian fiction, you can't beat Grace Livingston Hill, and on Kindle $1.99 great price.As a follower of Christ it is so great to have fiction to read that inspires you. Romance is hard to come by sometimes, and she always delivers, OK so it's 1920, girls are girls, boys are boys, and love is love.It's just simple, clean and good, and in these hard times we are experiencing, it's a nice reminder that we are not the first generation to experience hard times. Enjoy, and be inspired."
1,SLOW and PONDEROUS!,Too slow and boring though the plot was a good one. Would not recommend this one though I have enjoyed many of her other books.
5,the witness fascinating,"This book is awesome. When you first start reading you don't want to put it down.It's fast pace and thought provoking.The first time i started reading it made me question what was going on. So kept reading and it became more intriging and i had to read more. You get to the point you don't want to put it down, because you do loose yourself in the characters and their message."
1,The Witness,I did not enjoy this book. I never finished it. I could not get into it at all.The writing did not suit my taste. I read about 3 books per week and this is one of the only books I did not complete reading.
3,easy read,I like Christian fiction and have enjoyed several books by this author. Some of it is too predictable and not as much depth as I would like
5,Living life and enjoying the trip,In the journey of life one has many opportunities to make a difference. This book is a great story of a person who looks beyond the outer trappings and finds the greatest satisfaction of all.
2,my opinion of The Witness,This is just not my cup of tea. The style to me is dark and mysterious...but kind of boring. The drama seems a little unrealistic to me also. Maybe it just doesn't fit my personality and literary interest. Sorry.....
5,Loved the book,It was a great book. The author kept your attention. I liked the weaving of your faith intertwined into the entire book.
2,The Witness,Cannot not rate this book until I read it. I am in process of reading another book. I will read it as soon as I can and will rate it then
5,Awesome,"Never did I think I could tolerate a fully instrumental CD more than once or twice, but I was proven wrong. Of course, being a Michael McDonald fan, I'm a little biased in saying that ""Minute by Minute"" is the most well done track on the CD. Others I'd give honorable mention to are ""Nite Crawler"" which you can definitely enjoy while cruising, and also the remake of ""Tequila"" which Larry excellently made his own. This collection showed to me that Larry Carlton is absolutely quality jazz entertainment."
3,File Under Metal? NOT!,The back cover of cd said File Under Metal?This is mostly a hard Rock to melodic Rock cd.The first few songs are great speed metal type music. Then the songs drop tempo into Rock.And that is how I would file it...I love the singer Bernhard vocals.This German melodic Hard Rock Band is tight and this is like there 8th or so album so they know what they are doing.Most of the songs although good are to slow for me.Anyway it may be worth the price for the first few songs for a Metal head. It was for me.
4,Duck Dunn Good,"A good compilation of the playing style of Duck Dunn. Good selection of songs, decent recording. The separation of the bass to the left channel makes it easy to hear the bass parts. The lack of Tab might be considered a drawback, but I found it good exercise reading music. Muscians not being able to read, or at least know the notes on the bass staff is the real drawback. If someone has an interest in the Stax sound then this is a good way to find out."
4,It's a good start.,"The transcriptions in this book provide a good start to learning the material. They are not completely accurate, so if you want to play it the way Duck did, you still have to listen carefully and make some modifications to what's in this book. The inaccuracy exists in both note choice and in the sense of time written into the notation. Duck syncopates a lot, and the notation doesn't really reflect what he's actually doing. The book and CDs are a good start, but you still have to listen carefully to the original recordings."
3,"a little pricey, but not bad","-no tab is a little disappointing - considering these days its pretty standard to have both.-the book is a plastic spiral bound - so its not very durable - another reason it should be about $10 if not $15 less.-i've found a few mistakes in the transcriptions.-the discs are okay, but the bass is not all that prominent - and is somewhat drowned out by the other instruments (with that said, i am fully aware that this is the burden a bassist usually faces when trying to figure out basslines - but this book is supposed to be to about bass - i dont need the accompanying drums, guitar etc.- i just want to concentrate on the bass).-i have bought/studied from a lot of playalong bass guides - this one is nothing special.-the reason its worth getting is simply that there are no other books (that i'm aware of) transcribing the works of Duck Dunn.to sum up:-overpriced-not tabbed-not very durable-no other book like it (hopefully not for long)"
2,Better than nothing but not nearly the treatment these albums deserve,"BEWARE: THIS ENTIRE SET IS TAKEN FROM NOISY VINYL, even the tracks from Golden Down and Places I Have Never Been, which were both previously released on much better CDs. In fact, there was a bonus track on the Razor & Tie reissue of Golden Down that is missing from this collection. Sadly, the aforementioned discs are both out of print, so this may be your only option, and the first album has not been on CD before (which is why I purchased this). Still, if you can find the other releases, they are infinitely better quality. If you can't, this is better than nothing, just not what these fantastic and criminally under-appreciated albums deserve. Also know that Nile continues to release consistently excellent material beyond these three albums. I wholeheartedly recommend his post-Columbia output, especially Beautiful Wreck of the World (1999) and Streets of New York (2006)."
5,Advice that really works,"Face it, all of us academics would like to think that someday a muse will descend upon us and infuse us with the capability to write the great work in our field without self-doubt, procrastination, etc. Boice shows empirical evidence that demonstrates these hopes are in vain (which is no big surprise to anyone), but even better, he provides the solution: writing is like physical exercise--the more you do it, the easier and more pleasant it becomes--if you write a little bit every day, even if you think it's pointless, at the end of a six month period, you will have 150 pages of writing to edit. It makes sense and it works. He even talks about reasons that people want to resist this truth, and how to trick yourself out of your writer's block. Grad students especially should benefit from the strategies he suggests."
5,It's Great,"i love this album.Its really good.But my besrs are maria la del barrio,rosalinda,tu y yo..."
1,where is the cero star????,"This compilation is stupid. Maria La del Barrio? Rosalinda? Accion y Reaccion? Toda la felicidad? these songs are very stupid i'd rather prefer Amandote, Gracias a Dios, Sangre, Amarilo Azul. Please don't buy this album it's just waste of money. Please wait until EMI release a good Thalia's compilation because this album was released to forget about Thalia's crossover failed."
1,"mal, mal, mal","deberian de darle un buen jalón de orejas a quien escojió que canciones poner en este cd, cuando alguien compra un cd de grandes exitos, eso es precisamente lo que espera escuchar, no las jaladas que vienen aqui. ami me gusta la musica que interpreta thalia y pienso que dejaron fuera muuuchas canciones buenas, y eso está mal. el otro dia ví en una tienda un disco de exitos de gloria trevi (si, lo admito. me gusta gloria trevi) y era exactamente lo que queria. 3 cd's, dos con TODOS sus exitos y otro con remixes, a solo 100 pesos,era original hee, por supuesto lo compré =D, pero en cambio cuando ví el tracklist de este, dije ""ni de broma""les voy a decir las que hubieran puesto en el (o los) discos:amandotevengo de cañalovegracias a dios (aunque es cover, pero buen cover)fantasia....amarillo azul...uyy no me acuerdo ahorita : | pero hay muchas masno compren el disco, no tiren su dinero"
1,horrible alignment makes this tool unusable,"I just bought a pair of these and will be returning them because of a two millimeter misalignment at the ends of these pliers where the tips go. Two millimeters doesn't sound like much, but when you consider this tool is supposed to grab retaining rings as small as 1/4"", you realize these things are useless. Cheap pop rivets used for the hinge and handles add to the rickety cheapness of this product. The package says ""Made in USA"". What a sham(e).I exchanged them for the more expensive (by $10) but more solidly constructed KD 3151 Medium Convertible Replaceable Tip Retaining Ring Pliers. While not perfectly machined (these ain't Snap-On or Mac), I was able to remove the small 1/4"" external snap ring that I needed to."
5,Tennesseans in the Civil War - Part I,"This is an awsome account of the Military Histories of the Union and Confederate Armies in Tennessee and also includes information on other State's Armies,both USA ans CSA, as they were combined for different encounters.. This has got to be a MUST for anyone researching anything concerning the Civil War, as so much history of the War includes the Armies of Tennessee, which fought in battles and encounters in other States and includes soldiers enlisted from other states.. and see Part 2 as well."
2,Swurv away!,"I've had my Swurv5 now for 2 years and when I first got it, I loved it. Its very small, light weight and the fact that it doubles as a USB drive makes music transfer really easy (just plug in to USB port, computer recognizes it as another hard drive, and drop in your music). The reason I only give it 2 stars is for 3 reasons. 1.) It uses a proprietary cable. I lost it and could not find it anywhere, including on the support web site iclickdigital. 2.) The slider control is now broken on my unit after using it to navigate from folder to folder. I've been pretty light on the touch so to see that it is broken now is very discouraging. 3.) The support for this device is virtually non-existent. There are some chat rooms on iclick's website but no one could tell me where I could get a replacement cable. The bottom line is although out of the box, this is a great player, there are cheaper, more sturdy, and better supported mp3 players out there."
3,ok for the money,this player plays good but controls are hard to use it takes time to get use to them
1,"Cheap, Poor Customer Service, Faulty Software","First of all this is made of such cheap plastic it's ridiculous. Second it says on the box it works with Windows 98 but the driver files don't show up on 98 SE. Then their customer service is terrible. I've e-mailed 6 times in the past 3 days and haven't recieved any usefull help. They just ask me over and over what version of Windows I'm running.I had this rush shipped so I would have it for vacation. Well, I leave tomorrow and the darn thing still doesn't work."
1,Red Fish is a better title for this,Give this book to your children if you would like them to grow up as communist homosexuals.
1,My 2 cents,"The Rainbow Fish.If you find this book ""educational"" and ""enriching"" good for you. Buy it, frame it, give it to the poor for all I care. But what if this garbage is fed to your child in school? You might argue that this is not about socialism (although it is). The book plants a seed that social acceptance is important and linked to individual happiness. In order to be liked and accepted you have to share whatever the commune happened to want today. Read it to your kid if you like the message. Don't indoctrinate mine. Public schools exist on taxpayers funds. ALL taxpayers, not just bleeding heart liberals and parasites. I know our teachers can't be objective. I hope they can be neutral."
1,Brilliant! A Clever Segway For Indoctrination,"Author Marcus Pfister couldn't have written a more clever segway for the indoctrination for socialistic / communistic attributes for today's children.In a nutshell, the Rainbow Fish had more than other fish. The others were jealous and wanted what the rainbow fish had, shiny scales. They would constantly ask Rainbow for some of his scales, but he wouldn't opine. So, the fish alienated him.He grew concerned that no one would talk to him, so he sought the advice of an octopus, a creature in this book that I would equate with any modern US democratic party politician.The octopus says if you give each other fish each a shiny scale of yours, they'll like you and you'll be happy and have friends again (wealth redistribution). Rainbow does this, and the other fish hang out with him, and Rainbow's happy, so the book claims.I will never read this book to my daughter again, and this book now serves as a bottom liner for my bathroom trash can."
2,rainbow fish big book,"the story itself is fabulous for sharing and being a good friend. However, there is a typo on one of the pages where rainbow is spelled rainboe..... was going to use this for a lesson plan but cant now."
4,Beautiful pictures in this book.,Children like this book. The pictures are great. I think the story could use some work but all in all it is for children and they like this book.
1,Socialism Primer for Children,"This is a beautifully illustrated children's book that communicates socialist ideaology. The author equates individualism with possessive selfishness and promotes collectivism as the correct morality. He depicts the fish's scales as possessions that other fish are entitled to (ie...redistribution of wealth). Of course youngsters won't be able to identify the world view, but they'll be expected to internalize the social/political values modeled in this book."
1,weak story,"I know a lot of people rave about this book, but I can't figure out why. The moral of the story, sharing, is obvious, but the way it is explained leaves a lot to be desired. It isn't very creative or imaginative. I've tried reading this book to my son several times and he's just not interested."
1,The Soviet Rainbow Fish,"This book is about how you should sell yourself to get friends. It's about how everyone else deserves what you have. It's about how buying your friends is OK. It's pretty to look at, but morally bankrupt. If you read this book to your kids, make up your own words."
1,I had no idea Marx wrote children's books.,"A perfect gift for the burgeoning little red-diaper baby in your commune. I would have given more stars if it had been printed on post-consumer recycled paper in North Korea, Cuba or Vermont. It's never too early to teach the value of the collective over the individual. It's equally imperative to teach hatred of the those who have more than you."
1,not for children,Socialist propaganda. I would hate for my child to think or feel this way toward another or be treated this way by another.
2,sets bad examples for kids,"Pfister adds gold foil to the pages of Rainbow Fish for the fish scales. They seem to be gimmicky efforts to evoke feelings in order to enhance a weak story. The children who read the Pfister book are meant to become envious over the glitter of the gold foil as were the other fishes. Furthermore, the book is also quite steeped in the dreaded didactics. The octopus directly instructs the Rainbow Fish in ""correct"" behavior. Why should the Rainbow fish give up pieces of his body that protect him, to these other fish just so they will leave him alone? Some might be inclined to call this a Marxist philosophy incorrectly, but for the fact that the other little fish had no ""need"" for the Rainbow Fish's body parts. They simply wanted them. The worst human emotions should not be evoked in children's literature--at least not held out for modeling. Children should certainly not be encouraged to model conformity, greed, and buying friendship."
1,Being liked is more important than being your unique self.,"This story doesn't teach sharing; it teaches of giving away your unique identity, conforming to fit in and be liked by those who are nothing but greedy little beggars who withhold friendship from those who don't conform to their demands. Is this the ocean or is it my high school from 20 years hence? Children are better to be told stories about liking themselves rather than stories of doing whatever it takes to be liked by others.It's doubtful the two sides will agree on this book, but I suggest that before buying this it, take a moment to read it and determine the message for yourself.A better story about sharing is Donna Jakob's My New Sandbox."
1,"Appalling, I will never read this to my kids.","I received this book as a gift. Thankfully, I read it to my 3 month old twins so they really couldn't understand it. The moral of this book goes against everything we teach our kids about being themselves and making friends. What this book tells kids is that if you give others ""your most valuable possessions"" they will be your friends, and that everyone should look the same. I was dumbfounded when I read this book. All the other fish (that looked the same) shunned the fish that was different because it wouldn't give the other fish it's shinny scales. The idea of the fish taking off pieces of his flesh and body to make friends and discontinue to be exiled is disturbing. These are not the morals I want to teach my kids. I will never read The Rainbow Fish to my kids again."
1,Karl Marx would be proud,"Someone gave my daughter this book, and after one reading I tossed it. As many other reviewers have pointed out, the book begins with a premise which could serve to teach many valuable lessons. The protagonist is more beautiful than all the other fish, and is prideful because of his beauty. Rather than creating a story where the fish must deal with his pride, the author instead points to the fish's beauty as the source of his problem. In order to win acceptance with the other fish, he removes his beautiful scales and gives them to the other fish to buy their affection. If the author wants us all to be socialists, he should begin by giving his book away for free (hopefully, he won't. The last thing we need is greater circulation of claptrap such as this)."
1,The Worst Children's Book I've Ever Read,"I'm so glad I read this book before making the mistake of reading it to my children. Basically what it says is that if you're different, epecially if you have some gift that others envy, that you have to diminish yourself if you are to have any friends. What a pathetic message to send your children."
1,I won't be your friend,"This book has a terrible message. No one wants to be the Rainbow Fish's friend because he won't give them his shiney scales. Eventually Rainbow Fish gives all his scales away and everyone is his friend. So let me get this right, if I have something you want and I won't give it to you then you won't be my friend. Nice pictures, bad message."
1,this book teaches that being beautiful is wrong,"This book is so beautiful on the outside it's a pity that the words are so incredibly hurtful and wrong. The story is about a fish who is covered with beautiful scales. Another fish comes up and asks to be given one of the scales and the beautiful fish says no, after which none of the other fish will play with it. The fish is advised by someone ""wise"" to give away its beautiful scales so that the other fish will like it. It follows that advise and gives every other fish a scale so that by the end of the book the page is filled with a bunch of pathetic looking fish that all have one shiny scale and everyone is supposedly happy. For me this is a terrible moral! It's wrong to be prettier or smarter or more talented in some way? You should try to make yourself less pretty or dumber or ignore your talents so other people won't be jealous? It's OK to demand other people give you things that you covet? Yuk!"
1,Awful lesson to teach children,"After reading the reviews, I know that I am not the only one that believes this is a horrible book. This book teaches children that being different is a horrible thing to be. Shame on the publishers for publishing this book!"
2,Book with a Smell to It.,"Kids love the graphics. But the message -- you can ONLY be happy if you give up what is uniquely yours -- and the subtle doctrine - the ""common everybody"" WANTS what you HAVE -- leaves one feeling funny. Sharing is definitely to be teached but the message in Rainbow Fish is weird."
1,at first it looked good but later it [was bad],"This book made me think of these:In some group of ""friends"", you must follow what the whole group thinks. If you have a good reason but think differently from the group, well, they think you are disloyal to the group and they will kick you out. This group also tries to do things just because it has ten, twenty, or more group members, and exert power on other persons or small groups. To me, this kind of group stinks, and this book depicts a group similar to such a group and glorifies it.Extension to this story:The rainbow fish lost his scale one day, and he missed the scale so much. So he asked other fish, whether any one of them doesn't want the scale and will give it to him. Some fish say, ""I am very busy lately"". Some fish say, ""It is YOUR problem, not mine"". Some fish say, ""The scale is mine now and I am not giving it back. Get a lawyer. Don¡t disturb me or I will call the police""."
4,It's a classic picture book made into a board book.,"When I ordered this, I didn't realize it was going to be a board book! Opps! I suppose I should have read the product details a bit better. Oh well. Either way, however, it's a lovely story with nice pictures. I'm glad I bought it. :-)"
5,Beautiful and Enjoyable - Sharing is Important,The effects of the shiny foil used on the pages makes this book beautiful. The story of the Rainbow fish is one of making friends by sharing. In sharing special things we can be happy not just make others happy.
5,Delightfully illustrated to hold even a two year old's attention.,Thoughtfully & lovingly written to teach little ones about real friendship.
2,RAINBOW FISH,"THE BOOK IS A FAMILY FAVORITE, BUT I WISH THIS ONE DIDN'T HAVE THE MARKINGS IN IT..HARD TO CLEAN UP. OTHERWISE THE BINDING AND PAGES WERE IN GOOD SHAPE"
5,WONDERFUL BOOK GIVES PLEASURE TO ALL,THIS IS A LOVELY BOOK WHICH GIVE PLEASURE TO ALL WHO READ IT.BEAUTIFUL COLOURS
5,Wonderful Kids Book! :D,This is one of my favorite kids books. People who think it was socialist propaganda are shallow thinkers. This book is about in general sharing for happiness of others. When someone needs a hand or perhaps sharing a joke with others brings happiness to everyone. The overall message to children is to help others and spread joy otherwise selfishness will lead to loneliness. You can still have a capitalist system and help others. It's no different from getting Christmas presents for others and receiving them back. If everyone was helping each other out then we wouldn't have as many problems today. The illustrations are beautifully drawn and there's shiny scales which even adults love. This book is super awesome and I'm sad some people don't know how to enjoy things as I'm against socialism myself and found it to be a wonderful book.
1,The Fascist Fish,"When my daughter was born, we were given this book as a gift. The first time I read it to her, I closed it half way through and still shudder when I think of the message in this story - not to mention how many kids are getting this message. I have been told, time and time again, that this is a book about sharing, but I don't find that message at all. Instead, I see a uniquely beautiful fish who has a hard time making friends because he is different. So he starts giving away the very thing that makes him both unique and beautiful, his rainbow scales. Soon, everyone has his scales. Not only did he give away the essence of himself, but he created a world where, in order to get along, everyone is exaclty the same. Although the illustrations are beautiful, the subtle messages that we need to be the same in order to get along and that it is o.k. to change who you are to make friends are not messages I want my daughter to hear!"
1,"Be wary... Why ""bribe"" others into being your friend?","I agree that we don't need to flaunt the best things about ourselves, but I am upset that this book (and The Giving Tree) teaches children that they should give up the very things that make them special in order to have friends. If the other characters wouldn't be friends with Rainbow Fish simply because Rainbow Fish wouldn't give a piece of himself to them, then why should he want them as friends? What did they offer? Certainly not friendship! Talk about judging others! I like the story's attempt, but for a child, I think it backfires into a poor lesson!"
4,Colorful Illustrations are great,"My daughter is only 4-months old and doesn't have much of an attention span but she does enjoy this book more for just chewing on. She looks at the pictures and will listen to me read it beginning to end. I was surprised, but it is a hit! I'll be glad when she is old enough to understand the story too because it does teach a good lesson and is very cute."
3,Description mis-leading,"The story of the Rainbow Fish is charming and worth reading to your children.My issue is with the product description from Amazon.It stated this was a hard cover edition.When I received it, it was a board book.My purchase was for a five year old, who was a little insulted at being given a board book.Same great story either way, true, but a different reading experience."
2,Like a heavy handed Ayn Rand straw man,"This is a book about a fish who becomes a social outcast by refusing to give away his possessions who then redeems himself by giving away his possessions (the rainbow scales) until he has only one left, thus making everyone accept him.The message is so blatant and heavy handed that it could have been written by a one-dimensional villain from an Ayn Rand novel.Certainly a good book could be written about the isolation of thinking yourself better than everyone else, but that book could have been written without a political message of wealth redistribution."
3,Calm Down People,"Calm down people. This book isn't anything that deserves this much discussion. It's an average quality children's book; in the story and in the illustrations. The illustrations are nothing more than a marketing gimmick to get the attention of children and parents as they pass by the shelves at the bookstore. You take away the sparkle and the illustrations become forgettable. The story is predictable and cliche', but it does appeal to children. It's a very simple story about sharing. It won't turn your child into a communist or a socialist, and it won't make them lose their individuality. The author isn't attempting to brainwash your children. He's a capitalist that figured out a way to sell books because he noticed that small children like sparkly things."
2,this book is overrated,"I didn't think the illustrations were that great. All the sea life presented has a bland sameness about it and the colors are limited to a cold blue palette.More important,I think the lesson presented in this book is shallow and one-sided. Yes, the Rainbow Fish is vain and selfish but the behavior of the other fish is never questioned and therefore assumed to be correct. Why, for instance, does the little fish deserve a shiny scale? When he doesn't receive one he immediately tells the other fish and they all shun the Rainbow Fish. Apparently, the only way for the Rainbow Fish to regain their friendship is to ""buy"" it with his beautiful scales.I would have much rather seen the Rainbow fish do something heroic and perhaps lose or dull his scales in the process. Then the other fish could seek his friendship based on the Rainbow Fish's heroic character."
2,"Nice to look at, but a shallow message","When I first read this book, my husband and I were both disappointed -- is it about a vain little fish who learns that he can buy friends? That potential fishy friends will keep coming back for more snottiness as long as you have something they want -- or as long as you're beautiful? Quite frankly, I think the Rainbow Fish was the ugliest fish in the sea . . .Whatever happened to themes like ""never judge a book by its cover"" and friendship will come when kindness comes from within, when you are accepting of another's inadequacies as well as their excellence, or when you are honest and build trust by caring and sharing?"
3,I wish I still liked it!,"Rainbow Fish has been widely criticized for having a bad message. Well, I don't think the librarian an my school knew this because she read it frequently. I remember this book fondly and even have a framed pic of Rainbow Fish on my wall. But now that I reread it, I totally agree. This book shouldn't be read to young, impressionable children(K-2). Rainbow Fish gave all but one of his shiny scales to the other fish. Think about it parents. What if your child did that with his/her lunch money? Or lunch, for that matter?I really like the illustrations and can see why this book was popular, I just wish it had lived up to my memories. Maybe a parent could turn the books message around by saying that Rainbow Fish acted without much thought.R"
1,Don't be fooled,"At first glance I thought this would be a great book about sharing and mutual respect. Boy was I wrong! A little blue fish demands one of the rainbow fish's shiny scales and when he refuses, all of the fish shun him. It is only after he gives away all but one of his unique scales that the other fish befriend him. I think that's a horrible message! After reading this to my child we talked about the outcome and I told him that the blue fish was very mean and that you should love and care for someone just the way they are, and that envy, for shiny scales or otherwise, is destructive. After that lesson we threw the book away. It's a horrible story for children disguised in a very attractive package. Stay away!"
3,Nice but overpriced,Loved this book as a kid and I got it for my own. It is a very lovely book but it was much more expensive than I wished it would be.
5,Sharing is caring,"This book has pretty illustrations. Some of the fish scales are shiny which makes it fun to look at for kids from 4months to 4years (my kids' ages). A story about sharing our good fortune with others because it helps everyone, even ourselves."
1,Great for the young communist and socialist.,"If you are anti-individual, don't believe in personal property, and yearn to raise an aspiring communist or socialist, then this book is for you."
4,"Awesome book, very colorful","A beautiful book that illustrates how the beautiful rainbow fish, knew how beautiful he was from his sparkling rainbow scales and he learns to share his beauty with others. He makes friends by giving some of the other fish some of his rainbow scales. He is no longer the only fish with beautiful rainbow scales, but he now has many friends. Pretty pictures & drawings."
4,This book is good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I liked the part when he gives his colours to the other fish.
4,The Rainbow Fish,This stroy is about a fish who had glittery scales. All the other fish wanted to be like him so they would invite him to play with them. Rainbow fish was self centered and always said no. Once a little blue fish said if he could have a scale and Rainbow fish said no! All the other fish grew angry with them and didn't spoke to him. Rainbow fish was worried and went to ask advice to the Wise Octopus. The octopus said to be kind to others and not to be selfish. So he went back kome and gave the little blue fish a scale. The blue fish was so happy he couldn't wait to show of his glittery blue scale. Soon after all the fish wanted to have glittery scales. Rainbow fish gave everyone a scale and they all lived happly ever after as friends.I think this is a great book for children because it teaches them a lesson. The lesson is to be sharing and you will have many friends. Just like rainbow fish did.
1,Pure communist propoganda,"If you want your child to live in a Vietcong collective farm, this is the book for you. A fishy book. The Rainbow fish should have told them, ""you will have to pry my scales out of my cold..."" Well maybe not in a kids book ;)"
2,"Pretty, but not a good message","This book is pretty. ""Beautifully illustrated?"" Eh, maybe. But it's definitely one of those hidden message stories. Hiding under what appears to be just sharing, are a lot of themes I don't want to teach my child. The first time I read it, I knew I didn't like it much. Definitely seemed like buying friends or something like that, that just didn't settle well. I thought the other fish were the mean ones and forced the Rainbow fish into it. That didn't seem right. But the first time my husband read it, he LOST HIS MIND calling it socialist propaganda. Do I feel that strongly? No, but I believe his argument has definite credence to it. There are plenty of other books that teach sharing in a better way."
1,Round yourself down to be like others,"Someone gave us this book as a gift, I never would have purchased it myself for my kids or any kids. To echo what others have already said, it's about a fish with shiny scales who tears off her very skin so that she can buy the friendship of a bunch of mooching losers. I read it to my kids verbatim only once, but after that made up an alternate ending in which Rainbow Fish refuses to give her scales away. Rainbow Fish is lonely for a while but eventually encounters other fish with shiny scales like herself and lives happily among them, while the other fish who tried to beg her scales away from her end up being caught by fishermen and eaten.Read your kids Aesop's fables like The Ant and The Grasshopper instead."
3,Do I Have to Be Like Everyone Else to Have Friends?,"I am teaching this story to my first and second grade theatre students as it is part of the curriculum. But I am so bothered by its message I am finding it tough to do. It reminds me of the Kurt Vonnegut story in which the ballerina had to wear weights on her ankles so she wouldn't be better than everyone else and soar above them and the great athlete had to somehow lesson herself to keep all things equal. Why can't the Rainbow Fish be utterly beautiful and still have friends? Why must she lessen her beauty to be happy? We all have gifts that make us unique and wonderful. She should be applauded and learn how to appreciate everyone else's gifts as equal to her own instead of destroying what she is and has. I am teaching the ""sharing"" lesson and it just bugs me to do it. We should share but we don't have to share what makes us unique."
1,"Good Lord, this is a bad book. I can't believe it was published.","I totally agree with the negative reviews. My daughter sometimes asks me to read it to her and I must remember to get rid of it. I just use it as a tool to teach values that were not intended by the author.Allow me to add to the list of negatives by the other reviewers. For example, the blue fish should be detached and simply admire the shiny scales. It's rude to ask to have one of them. My daughter is four and I asked her if it's polite to tell her friend Emma that you like her stickers (yes). Is it polite to ask her to give you one of her stickers (no)? More important is not to backbite. The blue fish should not have gone to the other fish to tell them the rainbow fish wouldn't give away one of his scales. His backbiting caused all the other fish to shun the rainbow fish. The rainbow fish gave away his scales in order to have friends, not for the intrinsic ""goodness"" of the act. This book is just atrocious."
1,A Grotesque,"It is unclear how this managed to get published in the first place, but the message of self-mutilation for the sake of appeasement and egalitarianism is appalling, not appealing. It entered my house as a gift and, I am happy to say, quickly became the topic of an ongoing ""twisted moral interpretation"" contest among my children, all of whom categorically rejected the story in turn. On first exposure to the story, my latest two year old closed the book and forcefully discarded it shortly before the end.I await with some anticipation their exposure to Das Kapital, Mein Kampf, and Mao's Little Red Book."
1,Out of My Library,"Synopsis: The Rainbow Fish has lots of shiny scales. All the other fish won't play with the rainbow fish. Then the wise octopus says give away your scales. As soon as the rainbow fish gives away his scales, the other fish play with him. The end.Analysis:1. I do understand that this is *supposed* to be about sharing, but I think that pulling parts of yourself off and giving them away is not a good idea2. It seems rather socialist to me--everyone simply must have a shiny scale whether or not they have the capacity to grow their own shiny scales or not.3. Why should anyone have to pay people to be their friend???I don't think I like this book at all. The lessons it seems to be teaching are questionable to me."
2,Too Long for a Toddler,"I have a one year old and this book is too long with their short attention span, but she likes to play with it."
5,the story is as dazzling as the illustrations,"Rainbow Fish is a classic in the making. The pictures captivate the attention and imagination of even very small children. The story is both thought provoking and sensitive. We discovered that by reading about the problems of a selfish little fish, we were able to limit bouts of selfishness around our home by using the comparison. This tenderly written, almost magical story allows the readers and listeners to see both sides of the problem and feel both sympathy and empathy. the illustrations are so beautiful with soothing colour blends and textures that is as worthwhile to read as it is to just look at"
2,Rainbow Fish,This is a great story but I really expected the book to be a little bigger. I thought I was buying the hardcover but I ended up with a very small board book.
1,Just awful!,"The author depicts the beautiful Rainbow Fish as constantly and impolitely snubbing the other fish until they no longer want to play with him. Thus, he shares his scales with all the other fish so that he's no longer special and they all look alike. What?! This is not good.The message should have been that however you look, you should be humble and kind to others, not that you should rid yourself of (or share) all that makes you special and unique. Rainbow Fish should have kept his gorgeous scales and learned some manners. This is a bizarre and disturbing book whose popularity baffles me."
1,"A Horrible, Horrible Lesson","This book must be properly framed for a child, otherwise they will take away the lesson that fitting in is much more important than finding out what it is that makes us all different and unique. The book reads just fine up until the rainbow fish is told (mandated, nearly) to share with everyone the very thing that makes it unique - hence, to dillute itself and bend to the whims of others.I would have preferred to see the authors take a harder line against this, but I suppose that it's fitting in this day and age to teach our children that fitting in is #1, and realizing what makes you different, or special, or unique, is secondary and expendible.A real shame."
2,It's Rather Rotten,"I was gratified to see the trillions of lousy reviews for this book on Amazon. Still, I thought I'd throw in my shimmering scale too! And for those who think the book is some sort of insidious left-wing plot -- sorry, I'm as progressive as they come, and I hate the lousy thing too.The book's ""Give up what makes you special and bribe your way to friendship"" message has been adequately dissed in other reviews, but even leaving that aside, this just isn't a very good book. The text is insipid and the illustrations (once you look past the very lovely hologram foil effects) are weakly executed. If it had no ""message"" at all, this would still be a mediocre book, with no wit, originality, or compelling characters to recommend it. Two stars for the pretty kid-attracting fishy scales -- I would give it 1 1/2 if allowed."
2,Entitlement Fish,"This book was given as a gift to my infant daughter, who loves the illustrations. Once she is able to read, however, I think I'll put this book where she can't find it. This book claims to be about sharing, but it is really about buying friends - friends that feel entitled to have what is yours. The Rainbow Fish in the story is vain because of his beautiful scales. The other fish don't like him because he won't give them his scales. The way the Rainbow Fish makes friends is to give his scales away - there is never any mention of ""sharing."" I think this book sends an awful message about entitlement and jealousy, and the only thing that makes this book worth a look is for the illustrations."
1,A beautiful book with a very dangerous lesson,"This is a beautifully illustrated book which, on the surface, is a lesson about sharing. When you think about it a little more carefully there's another lesson: Conformity is more important than Independence. By the hero's sacrifice of the essence of what makes him special, we are also taught that mediocrity is to be valued above excellence. I think that it is neither wise nor desirable to teach our children to lower their expectations and do anything necessary to fit in with the crowd."
4,Two Fins Up,"The book The Rainbow Fish is a great book to own. This book is about a very colorful fish that had shiny scales. All of the other fish wanted one of the Rainbow Fish' scales, so they said that they would be the Rainbow Fish' friend if he were to give them a scale. Since the Rainbow fish had no friends he gave all of his scales away except for one. Then he looked like everyone else and he was very happy."
2,Terrible Message,"Someone just gave this book to my 19-month-old. Art-wise, it's a beautiful book. But I was just appalled by the ending. Sharing is great - but the rainbow fish should have given a FEW scales away, not all (except one). I will not read this book to my daughter."
1,Poorly Thought Out for an American,"Pros: colorful, easy read for beginning readersCons: gives the reader the belief that you must give away what makes you special in order to make friends.I personally don't want those friends, nor do I want my children to have them."
1,too small and came dirty.,"I love the story but the book is way too small for the price I paid and came dirty, I usually buy books used and looks worn but not dirty."
4,The Rainbow Fish,Everything is fine. It arrived on time and my grand daughter loves it! I don't know what else to say.
3,DVD will not play in US,"The seller marked this DVD as region ""unknown"". It clearly states on the DVD cover that it is region 2,3,4,5. Great DVD, but had to play it on my computer rather than on TV."
4,Same- Old Balls -Rock,"To explain Rhino Bucket, think AC/DC meets Ted Nugent meets Dangerous Toys.And it's all Texas style- crunch your balls metal.Good to have these guys back.Another great effort. If you like that simple,heavy, sleazy rock then this is it.You must be able to get over the AC/DC similarities to enjoy though. Bon's not with us anymore (R.I.P.) and AC/DC has not released an inspired cd in a long time.It sounds like a cd Bon would have loved to sing on.Always a few very funny/sarcastic lyrics.I won't bore you with specifics of each track.All are solid, grab it and chug down some brews."
2,and then it got old,"the title of this album says it all, a huge letdown after the first three releases"
3,Fun little band,If you like ska you'll like this. If you don't you wont. The concept of japenese ska is really cool . But overall this cd is just ok
5,"Fun for car rides, quiet time for kids and adults","My kids 4 love to listen to books on CD in their bedrooms during quiet time and in the car while we run errands or head to soccer practice. This anthology kept the attention of all my kids, ages 4-12 without complaints that it was boring or babyish. I enjoyed it myself, as well.The narrators' voices (one male and one female) are engaging and expressive. The illustrations in the book are colorful and include some history behind the poems. Not all of the poems are read on the CD and not all of the stories are read in their entirety, but instead there are excerpts of longer works, such as Edgar Allen Poe's ""The Raven."" I first borrowed this from the library and then bought it because we all loved it. It would make a great gift, too."
5,great read along for kids and intro to poetry,"Really nice book, lovely poems and my children read along with the CD. With all the state exams coming up, it is an excellent way to teach figurative language in depth and learn some of the classics long forgotten in school books today."
2,Very interesting product but,"Children have, obviously, a very short attention span. While this product doesn't focus enough on this aspect of children and poetry it is definitely worth the investmentBut I'd also add the CD: ""Poetry Classics To Funky Hits"" which has classic poems set to modern funky music (which infuses the music styles kids love with the greatest poems of all time.)"
5,An all time favorite since the day I first heard it,"I have bought this album so many times it just blows my mind. Yet for some reason I keep having to buy it over again. It seems to be an all time favorite of just about everyone that I let listen to it or borrow it, as it never quite seems to make it's way back to me. But that's ok as I'm glad to be able to share it, I would recommend it to any one interested in jazz, both adults and children alike."
4,"Splendid compilation, but one track stands out","There is one track on this CD that makes it worth purchasing all by itself: the Great Pumpkin Waltz, performed by the Chick Corea Acoustic Band. This rendition is absolutely superb and also sports one of my favorite double bass solos. Wow...The minus side are several sung tracks, of which only B.B. King's tongue in cheek performance is notable. And they really could have done without Kenny G..."
4,"The traditional songs, with a few jazz lite touches","My major problem with this CD is the combination of the traditional, wonderful jazz sounds (from such artists as Chick Corea and Dave Grusin) with jazz lite moments, such as the contribution from Kenny G. For Charlie Brown fans, this is a must-have--all of the songs that you know and love from the specials are here. If you're a jazz fan looking for a ""pure"" jazz album, this is probably not for you."
2,Organizing and Directing Children's CHURCH Choirs,"While the author is quite knowledgeable, this focuses entirely on creating and directing children's choirs for churches, which is not the only place to find one these days. Many of the information, therefore is applicable only in a church setting, and is not helpful to the budding secular choir director, particularly one located in a public school. I'm disappointed that the description of the book did not indicate it focused on churches, but I'm sure it will be a good resource for anyone in a church setting."
3,If you just can't get enough of a good thing...,"Great song, but it's on Your Arsenal; the added bonus here, though, is that this is a different version, arguably much better than the album's. This recording, used for the video, features clearer, more earnest-sounding vocals, and seems less distorted overall. Note to Smiths buffs: it also turns up the volume on the piano before and after ""Tomorrow,"" alluding strongly to ""Asleep"" off The Smiths' ""Louder than Bombs.""Other tracks include the pleasant fluff ""Pashernate Love"" and ""Let the Right One In."" Only for true aficionados--but a nice way to refresh the ""Tomorrow"" listen."
4,MOZ perfection,"""Tommorrow"" is, without a doubt, one of the most spectacular songs in the Morrissey canon...ranking up there with some of the stronger Smiths numbers. a perfect song that rocks with passion and sincerity. the band sounds tight and stronger than ever before. the bonus tracks here are also brilliant; especially the rousing ""Let The Right One Slip In"" which i find myself playing over and over again."
3,decent,"i just bought this filter and it works fine, although i could not get it to screw into my lens so i had to screw it into my uv filter and screw that into the lens. also there are some imperfections at the edge of the filter glass, but i do not notice any visual defects in my pictures, basically i do not mind because it costs half as much as the alternatives"
4,Great practice but has its problems,"I used this book extensively (basically I did all of the questions) to prepare for my class exams and for the shelf exam. I found it extremely useful, especially when I could do the questions with friends. The questions are challenging and integrative (ie: cell physiology questions had cardio stuff in them) and are framed in the, ""54 year old male complains of..."" type of format, which is great practice.The only reason it's not a 5-star is that there are lots of mistakes in here. Mistakes ranging from things as simple as wrong answers (ie: answer is ""e"" but the explanation clearly says ""a"" is the answer) to utterly incoherent explanations. I would say this happened about once every 15 questions or so. This is also why it's great for group studying because you can go over difficult concepts and also try to catch errors.Haven't used the 12th edition but my friend had the 10th and the differences from that and the 11th were huge."
1,This CD doesn't have the one song I wanted--,"Whatever happened to singles actually containing the song they claim to contain? This CD has 8 TRACKS--4 versions of two songs, none of which are the one from the movie ""Cool World."" You'd think that by advertising it as a single it would in fact be a single, but it isn't."
3,Fine for Second Monitor,Works fine for a second monitor - not very high resolution output however. I could only get it to display the medium resolution setting.
1,Problem with return,"It didn't work right and wanted to return for exchange, but I had to pay for return. Return postage was half the cost and what if the exchange had the same problem? So i just kept it."
3,came without driver or installation instuction,"Card works fine. Wish it came with drivers and instructions. Had to install it through Windows Safe Mode, otherwise, can't see anything on my widescreen monitor. Also had to disable onboard video after installing driver from off the internet. Used another computer to download driver. Be aware this card only works with Windows XP."
1,Unhappy with this produce,"I have not been able to use the video card. I installed the card and tried to retreive the drivers from the CD but windows xp sent a message saying ""no valid driver on the disk""."
4,Good Book,Good book for Accounting 1. Easy to understand and prepares you for later classes. Lots of good case studies in there as well.
1,A waste of time,"I found this book really wordy and boring, it put me to sleep. The whole idea of learning AIS from a textbook is just like trying to learn to use computer without a computer! The whole AIS operation circle isn't hard to comprehend, but learning it from hundred of pages of literature is a dumb idea. On top of that, I don't think I have to learn the definition of E-Business and its difference from Internet(is there a e-business operated without internet?!)."
5,WISH THE TOONIES WOULD VISIT KALAMAZOO,"My geography teacher read this book to us, then gave a asinement. We had to pick a city that was not where we lived and have the Toonies visit the kids there. What places would they choose for their adventures?I liked Kalamazoo becaus my Nana lives there. I put down that it would be fun for them to take over a car factory and then they could have a diffrent kind of action scene.I remember that the Toonies eat ink, and wonder if they could eat oil, too? Cars have lots of oil. Maybe the Mayor could get involved like that Apple dude did in Silcon Valey.This was a cool book.Buddy Wyatt"
5,DOOG TOONIE SHOCKS JER SPEECHLESS,"I thought it was funny when Doog (the main cartoon character) jumped out of the computer and Jer (the main human character) could hardly speak.Shelby,Brentwood, Californiaage 8"
5,WOULD LIKE TO READ MORE ABOUT THE TOONIES,"My Dad got this book from the Reno library for me. He thinks it's real clever. Me too ... I liked the way the TOONIES got into our world. Jeremy is a smart kid. I'm glad his parents let him solve his own problems. That was way cool. Wish mine would do that.Maybe this author could write another one, and let the Toonies visit Reno next time. Good job, lady!Tucker from Sparks, Nevada"
5,SPENT MY BIRTHDAY MONEY ON THE TOONIES. IT WAS WORTH IT.,"I got lots of money from my grandparents for my birthday. I saw the Toonies on the front of this book at Barns and nobel. They were so cool, I wanted to lern all about them.I like Jeremy, Doog and Unkle Wom. It was cool that Apple dude was in the book. That made it seem more reel.This was the most different book I have read. I would like to have more adventures with the Toonies.Chris from Mountain View"
2,Boring,"This book was a miss not a hit (pun intend!)it was so boring I could not even hardly finish with it. The authors first book ""Read between the lies"" was excellent, that is what prompted me to buy this book, she changed her style of writing this book was your typical romance. Go back to what you know best."
1,This is not a hit,"This book could not hold my attention,I would try to read it and fall to sleep don't waste your money on this book it is not worth it."
5,Good Reading,"I found Hitts and Mrs., to be a good read. It was a good example of `chick-lit' that didn't make the characters so stereotypical that you were just sick by the time you finished (if you finished). I started reading the book and couldn't put it down until I finished it. The flow was well paced and the main character Melanie Hitts was well developed as well as John.I found the subplots (which is essential to a good story about contemporary life as most folks have more than one thing going on at a time) to be a great diversion from the storyline when, at times, you just had to step back from John and Melanie so as to be able to really ponder what they were doing-was it right or wrong.I recommend the read for someone who wants to wrap their minds around something with some texture while traveling etc...Ms. Woolridge-Bryant did a great job and I look forward to reading more of her offerings."
4,Great read,I love the book but I think that Candace was wrong for getting mad at her friend for her own stupidity. I would have like to know if Griffin ever thought about giving Candace another chance. Will was a strong and good man to wait on Melanie like he did. Now that's LOVE I hope it's a sequel to this book so we can find out if Candace and Griffin work thier relationship out and if Candace and Melanie work out thier problems.
5,Definitely a hit!,"The author did a wonderful job of portraying some real intense emotions in this book with such discretion and candor. She leaves you with plenty of ""food for thought"" about situations in which we are quick to offer an opinion or judgment. If faced with the same situations in our own lives, we would not be so quick to make up our minds. There is a refreshing balance between the romance and the drama, which makes this a great book to read. I loved it!"
5,Loved it so much I read it twice,"I loved this book so much that reading it once wasn't enough. The first time I read it, I couldn't get enough of Melanie Hitts and the loves of her life (John Carlson and Will Freeman). I was really drawn to the characters and their chemistry. I also loved, loved, loved Candace and Griff. (...)This author is a great storyteller and knows how to hook a reader and keep them interested and thinking. Which is why I had to read it a second time. It made think about my relationships and made me realize that being jealous can be a waste of time and that just being in love isn't enough. You have to give it too."
4,Warning: Highly Addictive,"If you're looking for a good quick read, pick up Hitts & Mrs. but be prepared to set a while. It's very well done and it's a delightful story from beginning to end. And when you're done you're left wanting more."
3,Good Instrumental Defintion But Middle of the Road Melodies,"Fast Forward is another pleasing recording by Spyro Gyra. The lush sounds of the saxaphones, xylophones, guitars, keyboards, and special effects really soothe the soul. In addition, there is good balance between these instruments as one musician does not hog the spotlight on this release.The songs on this release are a bit less defined. Whereas the styles vary from jam oriened tunes to easy listening jazz, few of them have very memroable hooks. Ocean Parkway and Para Ti Latino probably have the most memorable melodies. However, other tracks focus on incorporating too many ideas without developing any of them significantly.A good pleasing listen especially as background music. However, the lack of consistent memorable song structure makes it fall notably short of their best release, Morning Dance."
5,Years Later It Still Amazes...,"I bought this the day it was released when I was 13 years old. This is my favorite Spyro Gyra album of all time. Bright Lights is the best on this album. Why would a 13 year old buy this album you may ask? Growing up in NYC and being exposed to Bob James, The Crusaders, Chuck Mangione and CD 101.9, it's easier to understand. If you're a Spyro Gyra fan and you don't have this cd, you've been dropping the ball for 21 years now, get it ASAP!!"
2,Is there light at the end of the tunnel?,"Here again as with ""Rites of Summer"", we have a CD with one great piece, ""Ocean Parkway"", hence the two star rating instead of just one. The rest are unmemorable at best and a far cry from the awesome melodies of ""Morning Dance"", ""Catching the Sun"" and ""Ingognito"".Advice: Fast Forward to their follow up CD, ""Three Wishes"". This is somewhat of an improvement but doesn't come close to measuring up to their early work."
4,"Excellent guitar, good songs.","I always like Steve Hackett's explorations. This album has a well-structured set list, the flow from song to song is very good. Cell 151 seems to be a tip of the hat to the disco machine, because of the insistent rhythm. My favorite is India Rubber Man."
5,Steve Hacketts ABACAB,"Another great one, even better than Cured as far as pop writing, he relies more on his Guitar chops here to carry a lot of the tracks and thats a good thing. I've played this right after Genesis's wonderful ABACAB album and they sound very good back to back."
5,JEB STUART: A TRULY RIVITING EPIC OF AN AMAZING MAN,"JEB STUART, WRITTEN BY JOHN W. THOMASON JR. ISSIMPLY MAGNIFICENT. THOMASON BRINGS TO LIFE THISMYSTERIOUS LEGEND IN A WAY LIKE NO OTHER. HIS VIVIDDESCRIPTION OF STUART'S CHILDHOOD, WARLIFE ANDDEATH PUTS YOU BACK IN THE MID 1860'S. STUARTHIMSELF AND THE CIVIL WAR AS A WHOLE ARE PRESENTEDWITH THE UTMOST DETAIL AND PRESCISION. JEB STUART ISONE OF THE TRUE CIVIL CLASSICS AND IT GIVES YOU THECLEAREST PICTURE OF THE MAN AND THE TIMES OUT OFANY BIOGRAPHY I KNOW OF"
2,From A Students Viewpoint,"I read this book for an analytic book report, and its a very heavy read for someone who just wants a simple biography. It trails off often about battles, and if you want information, you really have to look for it."
1,"Great music, lousy mp3s","The first May Blitz lp is one of the great rock lps of the 70's. Driven by Tony Newman's drumming and James Black's great minimalist guitar work. Spacey, rocking, prog, it covers a lot of ground. I would give it 5 stars for the music, but I must rate the mp3's as low as possible. The reason: they cut the guitar solos from Fire Queen and Virgin Waters. That's right guitar solos gone.. The mp3's must be from the terrible May Blitz/2nd of May cd where the songs from the great first lp were cut to make room for the complete music from the awful 2nd lp. If you are looking for all the music from the first lp do not bother buying these mp3s."
5,So easy for us older hands,Love having this replica of an old friend in the kitchen no more asking husband of company to come open a can.
1,"DO NOT BUY,DO NOT BUY,DO NOT BUY,DO NOT BUY,DO NOT BUY","WE HAVE HAD THIS MODEL FOR 4-6 MONTHS AND IT LITERALLY IS DISINTEGRATING THE DRIVE WHEEL THAT PRESSES THE CAN INTO THE CUTTING EDGE IS MADE OF INFERIOR METAL THAT ITS GRINDING ITSELF TO POWDER ,NOW THE CUTTING WHEEL IT SELFE IS DEFORMING SO BADLY WE CANT OPEN CANS WITH IT ANY MORE"
1,Not was it was supposed to be,"I ordered a wall mounted can opener, the description said, swing away wall can opener. What I received was a hand operated one instead of one that would be mounted on the wall. I sent it to my aunt and didn't know until this past weekend that she got the wrong thing. I wasn't happy over the wrong thing being sent. thanks for listening"
1,not happy,"I should have realized that the cost of this new can opener was to good to be true. Unless you put constant pressure on the can up and into the cutting wheel of the opener, the cutting wheel pops off. When this happens it is necessary to restart the cutting process. My old opener made in the USA NEVER jumped off of the can. I had that opener thirteen years. Just goes to show you that you never get something for nothing. These new Swingaway can openers are made in China. Manufacturing defect. Bad product."
1,Terrible item,"This is the worst can opener I have ever owned. I have used a wall mounted can opener my whole life, which is why I ordered this one. The last one finally got to where it wouldn't grip a can after many years of use. This one worked pretty well in the beginning, but now, only a few months later it will not cut a can open anymore. I just cut my thumb trying to pry open a lid. I need to take a picture of the next can that it fails miserably to open."
1,Quality has gone to zero,"Needed to replace my old wall-mounted can opener because it had become dull.Big mistake - it worked better than TWO, new Swing-a-Ways! Neither opened the can on the first revolution - took 2 or 3 to get it open.The magnet to hold the lid was not in either carton; I had to use the one from my old opener.I cannot find any competing brands - only ""distressed"" old models trying to be antiques, which I consider ugly.I'm still looking..."
2,Not the best,Bought in in September. It works but sometimes you have to go around several times also it is sometimes hard to attach it. I love this type of can opener and past ones I have had look exactly the same but seemed to have worked better.
1,Huge disappointment,"I have been using these can openers for years. I have purchased 2 in the past 8 years because they were used extensively. I felt they were essential in my kitchen. However, when I received this one I can't tell you what a disappointment it was. Not only was it a flimsy copy of the others but it can barely open a can. I still can't believe I have had to resort to an electric opener. I will never again buy one of these sight unseen.."
1,No good,It does NOT work at all. The can will not stay on the opener. I have never gotten a can open with it.
1,Disappointing,"My wife and I have always used a wall can opener identical in appearance to this one. Our old one worked well for many years before wearing out. Though this one looks the same, it won't open cans well at all. It continually slips off the can rim, requiring innumerable reinsertions. Several rounds are required to finally open the can and then I have to use a knife to pry the lid back because it is inevitably held on by a thread of remaining lid. The only hope you have in getting a good opener is if the particular one I received is a coincidental, rare dud. I can't know if that is the case, but I may have to resort to an electric opener or risk damnation for cursing every time I open a can. I'm writing this not to malign the maker, but to save you from yours (;))."
2,faulty product,"this is the 3rd Swing-A-Way can opener we have purchased. It does not open a can all the way. It leaves a short piece of the lid attached. Sometimes it leaves two pieces. Unfortunately, we did not save the packaging, etc. or I would return it."
1,"Does not open the can, slides off the rim!","This is not the same as similar looking ones of old. IT almost always grinds up over the rim, & not cutting the lid off. Have tried tilting, pushing up, etc. None work. Am returnuing it for a refund. Must have been re-designed, but now does not work. do not buy it."
1,Made in China - What Else is New?,Poorly manufactured by cheap labor in China. I ended up returning it for a credit refund. The magnet was broken off the minute I took it out of the package. These used to be a high quality product before they were shipped off to be manufactured in China with inferior materials. I should've known better!
5,Why buy an electric can opener?,This unit just keeps on going like the Eveready bunny. Our first one lasted 15 years. This one is probably going to be my last. Just because it may be manual doesn't make it inferior or harder to use. Try one. You'll thank me.
1,DUD,I ORDERED THIS CAN OPENER AS THE ONE I HAD WAS REMOVED FOR PAINTING AND I FIGURED IT WAS TIME TO REPLACE IT. WHEN IT CAME I THREW THE OLD ONE AWAY. (BIG MISTAKE) I PUT UP THE NEW ONE AND IT DOEASN'T OPEN A CAN ALL THE WAY ARROUND. IT SKIPS. SOOOOO DISAPOINTED. CAN'T SEND IT BACK AS I THROUGH THE BOX AWAY. BUMMER.
1,"cheap, in a bad way!","I have had this opener just over a year. My OLD swingaway, which I bought used, finally wore out, so a little over a year ago, I ordered another one ""just like it"" to replace it. Let me tell you, this new one was not ""just like"" the old one. I noticed right away that the metal was not as heavy, but figured as long as it still worked, it would be ok. Well, last night opening a can, the can would NOT stay ""attached"" and I had to reattach the can about 5 times to finally get it opened. Very frustrating! What is wrong with companies making products that will last?I just ordered a completely different brand, Swing-a-way aint what it used to be!"
1,Very Poor Quality,"Like other reviewers, I tossed out our old swing-away opener after installing the new one. Boy am I sorry. No matter how hard we try, the new one will not cut around a can without several tries. We end up with lots of sharp cutting barbs and the lid is still on. This was never a problem with the old one. Do not be tricked into getting this one!"
1,Very inferior product - disappointing,"This (Chinese-made) Amco wall can opener is inferior in every way to the hand-held (USA-made)version that I have had for years and still use to this day.The metal the body is made of is thin.It is impossible to engage the cutting wheel without tipping the can to place it under the cutter. So if the can has any liquid in it, like soup, it makes a huge mess.Also, because of the thin metal of the body, the opener fits very loosely inside the slot on the bracket and constantly pops out, which requires one hand to hold the can and the other to do double duty - turning the handle and holding the opener in the slot.What an annoying waste of money."
1,CHINESE JUNK,THIS IS NOT THE CAN OPENER YOUR MOTHER HAD. THIS IS A CHINESE KNOCK OFF. WORKED FOR ABOUT 6 MOS. NOW THE SOFT METAL GEARS AND CUTTER WON'T OPEN CANS. WE USE THIS IN A HOME KITCHEN AND IT HAS NOT BEEN MISUSED IN ANY WAY. I HAVE 2 OF THE HAND HELD CAN OPENERS BY SWING A WAY THEY ALSO SUFFER FROM METAL FATIGUE. THEY STILL WORK BUT NO BETTER THAN ONE FROM THE LOCAL GROCERY STORE. THEY ALL STARTED OUT FINE BUT THE CHEAP METAL SOON GAVE OUT. BUYER BEWARE!!!
1,Won't even punch a hole in the lid.,"The can jumps out of the gears, and that's on a good day. Usually the opener doesn't even punch a hole in the lid. Misdesign? Sloppy tolerances? Manufacturing error? I don't know. The opener is in the trash now. I will never buy another Swing-A-Way product. Maybe they were good in the past, but their modern incarnation gets an F from me."
4,classic read,A gift for the classic reader. The pages are thin which makes reading difficult for the older reader.
4,Okay!,"Color is off a bit based upon internet picture. Overall, nice looking shoe and semi-comfortable."
5,must have,"this is a collection anyone must have, you only have to compare any piece with the better selection you already have in your collection,for example: compare moravec vs rubistein on the ballades, you will be surprise, you can have 2 versions you love side by side, the same with ravel, not to mention the selection of mozart. the sound is wonderfull,in the demostration class, even on the recordigs made in 1964, most of the pieces are licensed by mr. moravec, i assume he was involve in the selections of this box for supraphone. thanks for make me happy another time. dont forget is this box please you to try mr moravec chopin nocturnes, another wonderfull comparation with rubinsten,pires,ashkenazy, arrau to mention some."
5,Love this toothpaste!,"Of all the toothpaste I have tried over the years, Mentadent proves the best in quality. The Crystal Ice is my favorite and I order this through amazon because I was not able to find this one in stores. The hydrogen peroxide and toothpaste blend are the ""best"" among all brands with similar ingredients. For the price it is well worth ordering online. I highly recommend Mentadent toothpaste."
4,Wonderful Literature,"For those of you that admire great writing, you'll enjoy this book. Alistair MacLeod is a master at describing great beauty found in some very ordinary people.Other reviewers found the book slow moving. Some people also find waiting for a sunrise a big waste of time, children giggling at the table - annoying, and vacations to Maui boring. This book is not for you if you seek the entertainment of a fast-paced plot. But, if you enjoy character development and thoughtful prose, you'll enjoy this book.The reason I rated this a 4 instead of a 5 is that I enjoyed his short stories in his book ""Island"" even more than this book."
3,Quite a downer,"Well written and interesting book about a family's difficult life - but certainly not something you want to read to lift your spirits or give you any inspiration. One bad thing after another and the only message for the reader is ""life is tough"" and then you die......"
3,"I appreciated how well written this book was, however, my attention did keep wandering throughout.","I appreciated how well written this book was, however, my attention did keep wandering throughout. I think this book deserves someone who can sit down for a half hour to an hour at a time. Repeatedly picking up the book made it hard for me to tell where I was in the story at times. I would try another book by this author."
5,"Evocative, haunting and beautifully written",This wonderful tale of family is full of rich imagery and memorable vignettes. A great novel.
2,not what i expected,"I selected this book because of the great review. While the book held my interest and was quaint, it was no literary masterpiece. It created a somewhat interesting weaving of the relationships of an extended family, but never really developed any of the characters to the point that you could relate to them. I found it somewhat shallow in this respect which would have been ok if the plot line carried the book along, but it to was light and unfulfilling."
2,Disappointed,"Before visiting Cape Breton Highlands and since then I have tried to read everything I can about the area. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. This book however, did not live up to my expectations. It seemed very disjointed, had nothing really to do with it's title. Had I not previously visited Cape Breton, reading this book would not have made me want to go there."
4,Well Written Valentine to Nova Scotia,"Alistair MacLeod has created an incredibly well written novel, and an all out love letter to Cape Breton. Told first person, the book is like sitting down with a grandparent as they recount your family's colorful past. Moody and evocative it's the kind of book to curl up with in front of a fire and let it wash over you.Fans of the book ""Cold Mountain"" would probably enjoy this as well since it adopts the same steady slow moving pace, while reaching depths of emotion through memory. I only wished I knew the areas of Nova Scotia he was talking about, because that would of made it an even richer reading experience."
5,Spare and haunting,"This book is one of the most beautifully crafted, coherent and moving books I have read in a long time. What he says in one line would take a lesser author twenty. He evokes the kinship of brothers, the importance of history , the impact of chance and the integrity of nature.His characters ring true and speak in voices you can hear across the table in a Cape Breton kitchen. It would be so easy for a book like this to fall into the toe-tapping, beer swigging , Gaelic caricatures so often served up. It weaves love and tradgedy with humour and grace.I sat in the hammock at morning chorus with the book and didn't leave until it was finished. Please don't take 10 years to write your next one Alistair."
1,"Good shape, bad reading",The book arrived as promised and in good shape. The reading of the book proved laborious and none of the people in the book club finished it.
4,"A sense of the place, and the time","I bought this book because I will be going to Nova Scotia for vacation for the first time next month, and I wanted to read some fiction that describes that part of the world. I did enjoy it and got a real sense of the place and the history of the Scottish people who migrated and settled in Cape Breton. There were some characters and elements that I thought could have been explained a bit more deeply, especially the animosity between the French Canadian and the Cape Bretoner miners. It wasn't always clear why each had so much distaste for the other, although perhaps that was the point. My French is not great, so I missed the significance of the French quotes (to all those bilingual authors...translations would be very helpful to readers like me...). I admired this author's writing style and language. I also appreciated that the book is not overly long -- I would have tired of this story if it had gone on for much longer."
5,AMAZING,"One the best books I have ever read. I don't normally read books that based on ""real"" life, but once I picked this one up I couldn't put it down. I laughed, I cried, I felt connected to the characters. I am now a huge fan and look forward to his future works! PLEASE READ!!"
3,Banana Seat,Delivery was fast and efficient. Good service overall. No complaints about that.The seat wasn't quite what I was looking for but it's hard to judge when you can't see it in real life first.
2,A Sheepish Entry,"As an avid reader of the Dr. Nightingale series I was disappointed by this effort. The main plot is contrived. Didi seeing the dairy industry and her practice failing goes to a convention in Atlantic City to bone up on the latest techniques in the horse industry. When she wittnesses the death of one of the speakers, the widow seeks her out and offers her a small fortune to edit her husband's book in Florida. But more people die and Didi thinks she is next. The clues are obtuse and the motive undetectable. It needs to be explained in the final chapter.Back home Charlie is running amuck again. A little of Charlie goes a long way and this was way more than I needed. On the other hand, Rose and Allie provided the most interesting subplot. And because of it I am very eager to read the next book in this normally excellent series."
4,Another fine entry in the series.,"Dr. Nightingale continues to learn her veterinary craft. This time she travels away from home and (naturally) lands in the middle of a murder. Meanwhile, Charlie's up to another of his bizarre money-making tricks. And what's going on with Allie? This one has fun along with the creepy corpses. And what's it all got to do with horses? Aah, read it and see!"
2,very disappointed,"I bought this for my daughters for Xmas because they love to sing and dance in front of a mirror; and this is one of the few karaoke machines with a video camera. It also supposedly has more wattage than some of the others. THANK GOD I tried it before Xmas after my daughters were in bed. What a dissapointment. The camera/video is unrecognizable -- fuzzy, dark and you can barely tell what you are looking at. Also you can BARELY hear anything through the microphone. Basically this is a not so cheap, poor quality CD player. I am returning it ASAP."
4,ALOT OF FUN AT A GREAT PRICE,I bought this for my husband and 7 year old son for Christmas. After I had placed the order I read a very poor rating for this product. I was scared after that but luckily the Karaoke worked like a dream. We all had hours of fun on Christmas and everyday after without any problems at all. The quality of sound took abit of adjusting but once set it worked like a charm. The video camera worked well too. Kids and adults love watching themselves sing. I highly recommend this machine as a gift for either an adult or child. They should include earphones for thoughs of us that can't carry a tune though. (hee hee) Happy Singing.
5,THis is awesome!,"Within minutes of taking out of the box we were singing and laughing! The other reviews lead me to believe that they don't know how to hook it up. It is awesome, you can see the video playing on TV. The graphics on the 5"" screen are great for singing along.For $30 shipped, this is the steal of the year!"
2,"Great fun....but, Monitor broke on first day","Less than 3 hours out of the box, it went from working beautifully to having a broken monitor (it went totally dead). Not sure what happened. The product was great fun while it lasted (2 hours), and even after (we just hooked it up so that the words showed on the TV). I will be returning it, but I am undecided if I want to exchange it for the same one, probably not."
1,LASTED ABOUT TEN MINUTES!,AFTER WE GOT IT ALL SET UP WE REALIZED ONE OF THE TWO MICROPHONES DID NOT WORK. SO AFTER USING THE OTHER MICROPHONE FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES IT ALSO STOPPED WORKING. THIS WAS A GIFT THAT WAS VERY WANTED. WE ARE SO SAD THAT WE NOW HAVE TO RETURN IT. WHAT A LET DOWN. MY DAUGHTER IS VERY DISAPOINTED. ALSO THE PICTURE IS REALLY NOT THAT GREAT. ITS VERY LIGHT AND CLOUDY LOOKING. WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. FOR THAT PRICE WE EXPECTED BETTER QUALITY.
2,okay for three days,"My daughter received this for Christmas. The mike isn't very good, but she didn't seem to mind. The camera worked for three days, then inexplicably stopped and we had to return it. I'll replace it with a different brand."
1,SMOKING piece of junk!,"My in-laws purchased this machine for my daughter last Christmas. I read the directions, plugged it into an outlet, then went back to the owner's manual to continue reading. Within twenty seconds I smelled something awful, looked up, and saw SMOKE billowing out of the top of the machine! I could not believe my eyes--I have never had any electronics product do this before in my life. I immediately unplugged it and dashed it outside in case it caught on fire. What a total piece of JUNK! The unit was powered OFF, not even turned on for the first time! I am giving it one star because I cannot give it 0 or negative stars. This will be my last experience with any smoking Craig product!!"
5,Very handy,"This really helped me out in doing some basic maintenance on my bike, good detail and covers pretty much all the technical issues you could face."
2,"Like, a TOTAL dissapointment","Okay, so I, like, wanted this nail polish for my b-day and my gurlfrend Emily gace it to me and OMG it just was so cute! And then I put it on and then, like, get this, it wouldn't come off! And then I was like, Em, gurlfrend, we gotta talk why did you give me this, like, nail polish that won't, like come off? And then we had a big fight and now she's not my friend anymore and IHATEHER. So anyway gurlfrend, don't buy this namby-pamby wishy-washy stuff."
3,Kinda Watery,This was a gift. The person it was for felt it to be to watery. Color was good and deliver was fine.
1,Wrong color,"My friend owns this color so I knew exactly the name and what the color looked like in person. I tried buying the color in nail salons but it was too hard to find so I was excited to see it on amazon. However, the color was verrrrrry different than what what it should have been based on the name. It is very sheer and more of a bubble gum pink than a champagne pearly color. What a disappointment!"
5,Great color,"Really love this color, wish it was still offered in the gelcolor line.OPI is always my go to polish and this was no exception."
5,This is my favorite color,"OPI makes awesome polish. Period. This color is light, easy to wear with just about anything and my favorite color for everyday. It is office perfect, date perfect, activity perfect."
3,Liked the color but...........,"I loved the color of this nail polish but with two coats, plus a base coat and a top coat it was already coming off by the next day."
2,"ok, OPI polish","OPI is supposedly a good, and expensive polish..However, it chips. Every OPI I have owned has had the same problem. I won't buy it again."
3,Shipping nightmare.,"The product is very nice it's self. However, the shipping cost an arm and a leg, and still took forever to get to me."
4,"Gorgeous color, great quality","This color is extremely classy and works well for both winter and summer. OPI also has a great quality of polish, making it especially long-lasting. If it were a little bit cheaper, it would be perfect."
5,Excellence,"I loved the product, I saw it at a nail salon and it was perfect for me and it looked great for when I go out Thank you again."
4,With a Little Help From Her Friends.,"Diane Schuur has a great voice and with this GRP digital master, this collection of tracks sounds quite good. However, for some reason, the music sounds better mastered than the voice here. No doubting the quality of the track selections but perhaps it's time to look at remastering this to improve the voice levels. Some tracks, especially the earlier ones have lower volume levels than the later tracks. Still, if you are not too bothered about the sound quality, this is actually a very good place to find a representative sample of Ms. Schuur's work. Very refreshing and soothing, her voice is uniquely and distinctly hers. Here she is also joined by a litany of jazz greats like Stan Getz, Jose Feliciano, Dave Grusin and many others. Recommended but you may want to wait and see if a remastered version of this comes out soon."
4,"Fun Toy, Works Well - Recommended","The ""Zero Blaster"" is a fairly fun toy that makes smoke rings and projects them some 6 to 10 feet. For best visibility and accuracy, use in a darkend room without any drafts. Make sure to read and follow the directions for best results. The included fluid does last a good long time.This is a toy that will get a lot use when you first get it, and then likely be put aside. We pick it up every few months and play with it.Recommended!"
5,"Jan's best book yet, a gifted writer in her prime!","HOCUS is Jan's best book to date. Her main character, Irene Kelly, has gone beyond the two dimensions of Jan's words to a three dimensional heroine who you might find squeezing avocados next to you in the produce section of your local market. Jan's writing flows naturally along with the pacing of gifted story teller, yet carries the passion and intensity of an experience that must be passed on to as large an audience as possible. The clarity and understanding that Jan shows for the emotion of this story, painted deftly into the background of each page, are the strengths through out this enjoyable and rewarding book"
3,The upholders of the Cult of the Ego,"James Gibbons Huneker's ""Egoists"" is a diverting compilation of essays, exploring the personalities and lives of some of the greatest artists, poets, litteratures, philosophers and mystics who have advocated the creed of individualism, in opposition to the sentiments of equality, brotherly love and socialism. The essays combine entertainingly critical and analytical insights with a melodic prose style characterised by a sweep and grandeur of rhetoric, and many a flowery turn of phrase. A little dated, perhaps, but fun."
5,More than 100 minutes of pure fun !,"I must say I decided to review this film because it had so much negative reviews. I LOVE this film. It's pure fun and completely crazy and it's fine like that. If you want to watch an art film, don't watch an Elvis Presley film.I would really like this film to be released on DVD. I don't understand it's not on DVD yet as you can find horrible Elvis films like HARUM SCARUM or FRANKIE AND JOHNNY already on DVD. As I'm writing this review the following Elvis films have not been released on DVD yet: KISSIN' COUSINS, TICKLE ME, LIVE A LITTLE, STAY AWAY JOE and ELVIS ON TOUR. With the exception of COUSINS, the other four films are among Elvis's best.STAY AWAY JOE is a fun film to watch but it's sure that you won't like it if you don't like Elvis. So if you don't like Elvis, stay away!"
1,ARGUABLY ELVIS' WORST MOVIE EVER...,"... and Burgess Meredith, with the ridiculous make-up job in an attempt to make him look Native American, isn't going to fool anybody... why didn't they just get the real thing, like Chief Dan George?With a Spanish stepmother who actually looks like Elvis and could believably pass for his real mother, why would they cast short, weaselly Burgess Meredith as the father??? For sure, the plotline should have been tweaked here and there, along with some sexier-looking chicks and a better Elvis soundtrack."
2,Stay Away Joe - Elvis,I have a collection of all of Elvis' movies - this is one of only two that I didn't particularly care for. Doesn't show Elvis' talent at all and frankly I just felt the movie lacked substance. Elvis could have been an excellent star if he would have been given roles to play that tapped into his dramatic side.
1,They Threw Away The Boilerplate and Still Made a Bomb,"If you watch the original trailor or listen to the songs from this movie you can't imagine that it could be so bad - the primary reason is that Native Americans are portrayed in the most stereotypical way possible. This is amazing in light of Elvis' Pacer character from ""Flaming Star"" eight years before, which received formal recognition as a positive portrayal. The film also has a very low budget look. For Elvis historians, it's possible to view it as a step closer to the '68 TV Special and re-emerged credibility."
2,Strange Elvis Curio,"Elvis Presley gives one of his liveliest performances in ""Stay Away, Joe"" (1968) while singing only a few songs. Though a significant departure from the musical-comedy formula, the overall film is a misguided adaptation of Dan Cushman's satirical novel. Scenic Arizona locations and a fine veteran cast accomplish little in this hopeless mess. Nevertheless, curious Elvis fans might want to take a look."
1,NEVER LOOK BACK,"I GUESS THIS MOVIE MUST HAVE BEEN THE MOST EMBARRACING MOVIE MADE BY ELVIS. IT ALMOST FAILS ON ALL COUNTS AS A MOVIE,PRODUCTION,SCRIPT AND PLOT.ELVIS USE TO REFER TO MOVIES HE WOULD LIKE TO FORGET,AND SADLY ENOUGH THIS IS ONE OF THEM.THE MOVIE ALMOST STEALS THE CHARISMA AND CHARM OF ELVIS,BY FORCING HIM TO ACT OUT SILLY ROLES AND READ RIDICULAS SCRIPTS.IRONICALLY I WOULD STILL RECOMMEND THIS FILM TO ANY ELVIS FAN BECAUSE THIS FILM WAS A CHANGING POINT IN HIS CAREER WHICH LEAD HIM BACK TO SINGING.JUST WATCHING THIS FILM IT BECOMES APPARENT ELVIS HAS LOST INTEREST IN ACTING.ITS SAD TO SEE A GREAT MAN HAVE TO PUT HIMSELF TO SHAME IN FILM LIKE THIS."
2,Plain's gone downhill,"Every year or so I look forward to the new Belva Plain novel and each year for the last 6 or thereabout I've been disappointed. This has been a LONG road downhill since Evergreen, whose pages I still re-read when in need of a classic.The Sight of the Stars has a boring, plodding lead, Adam, who performs not a single exceptional act in the entire book. Plain leads you to believe that it's his very decency that is heroic; but instead, even to the end, you're left wondering what great event is going to hapen to make this book worthwhile reading. Subplots concerning his strange brother, Leo and his other brother's fiancee, with whom he spends two cheating nights (not even detailed!) fail to arouse any interest. Even the last few pages, which I will shall not spoil by revealing, do not close the book satisfactorily.Oh, for another Anna, Joseph or Paul... Save your money and let's hope for a better product in the next year or two.."
1,What a letdown,"I have always looked forward to Belva Plain's new books, but this may be the last time I buy one in hardback. I kept waiting for something else to happen...the ""affair"" just did not live up to the claim of ""unimaginable betrayal."" Unfortunately, that type of betrayal is all to imaginable in today's world and just did not make for an interesting read. Maybe Leo's blackmail was the act of betrayal, but again, it did not live up to the claims. Very disappointing."
3,Very nice read,"I found this book to go by very quickly, but I also had some questions that went unanswered. The whole side story of Adams brother Leo was never really detailed...what exactly were all the books he was reading, and hiding from everyone, and why? What was the shattering secret that reached back centuries? These and other questions were not explained.It was also at times a bit difficult to follow. When starting a new chapter, a couple days to a few years may have passed, but you didn't know it when starting the chapter. You just have to figure it out.Overall, it was a very nice story, Adam was made out to be a bit more of a hero then was called for, but the characters were very nice to follow. I recommend it if your bored and just want a fast read."
2,Like reading Cliff's Notes,"Reading The Sight of the Stars was like reading the Cliff's Notes of an epic novel. This story could have been great. It could have tugged at hearts and been movie material. Instead, this was like reading the outline. Paragraphs spanned weeks or months. The characters were plain, unfortunate, and sadly lacking in personality. Sorry... I wanted to like it."
4,the Sight of the Stars,",I really enjoyed the book, her books are like sagas,they go from generation to generation. You just live her books. She is my favorite author"
2,What a disappointment!!,"There are so many time-frame discrepancies in this book. She refers to a guidance counselor in the high school. It's 1907 for Heaven's sake - no guidance counselors back then! Most people didn't even earn a high school diploma! Author also speaks of bio-chemistry. In 1912, it would have been just plain chemistry. The sons in this book referred to their father as ""Pa"", but called their mother ""Mom"". Surely she would have been either Mother or Ma. Mom is a much more recent name. And she speaks of people taking accounting classes. It would have been bookkeeping back then. These concepts were so distracting to this reader. Belva Plain's writing has deteriorated with every book since her first terrific ""Evergreen"". Don't bother to buy this book. Borrow it from your local library, if you feel the need to read it at all. Such a disappointment!!!"
3,Disappointing? Unfortunately yes...,"I hadn't read Belva Plain for a few years until I spied this one displayed in the new book section of our public library. Now I am glad I didn't purchase the book. It is a common story with common writing, not worthy of Ms Plain and her reputation as a great story teller. I, too, was waiting for some deep dark secret to be revealed, especially concerning brother Leo and his strange behavior. She should have developed his character more and Adam's less. I have recently read some of my faviorite author's latest works (Grisham, Steele, Fielding, Cook, Evans) and have to make one blanket statement about them all. They aren't as good as they used to be."
1,Part not recieved but charged no longer needed what to do?,I ordered two different items .One part came the other (generator) didnt. I no longer need this part but I was charged for it. What is the next step?
5,It works now....,I found an old Coleman 220E lantern at a yard sale. Didn't work right off the bat so I replaced the mantles and the generator and now I have a working lantern. Install is pretty simple. You might be able to get away by just cleaning it but I decided to go the easy route and just change it. I plan on using it for a while so might as well invest in a new one.
